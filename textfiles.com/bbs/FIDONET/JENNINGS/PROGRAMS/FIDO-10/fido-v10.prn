                This manual is new for version 10 of Fido. It covers
        all of the previous three manuals, and supercedes them. This
        is totally new documentation, though you will find
        occasional paragraphs the same. Hopefully, this new
        organization makes more sense.

                Fido #1 415/864-1418 300/1200 24 hrs.


                Fido supports only the following hardware, though
        others may be oneday supported, in the definitely
        unspecified future:

        IBM PC, XT, AT, Junior
        DEC Rainbow, 100, 100+, 100B
        Otrona Attache 8:16

        D.C. Hayes SmartModem 300, 1200 and clones 
          EXCEPT Anchor Automation
        Racal Vadic VA212
        DEC DF03
        Novation SmartCat series

                Fido requires 256K of memory, and MSDOS 2.00 or
        higher, and at least two floppies. It is recommended that
        you use a hard disk.

                The following people have contributed greatly to the
        design of Fido and FidoNet. I probably omitted many people
        from this list; apologies ahead of time. Thanks also to the
        many Fido sysops and callers that contributed ideas (and
        found the many bugs).

                Special thanks to John Madill, who thought out many
        of the nicer Fido features, and did much of my debugging for
        me. 

                Fido and FidoNet Design Crew:

                        John Madill, Baltimore, MD      (Fido #2)
                        Tony Clark, St. Louis, MO       (Fido #4)
                        Danny Feinsmith, NYC, NY        (Fido #8)

        Fido's Operating Manual T. Jennings 1 Nov 84            Page 3

                Fido is a package of programs that allows an MSDOS
        computer and modem to be used as:

                - A Bulletin Board 
                - A Private Mail System
                - For Binary and text file transfers
                - Has Extremely high system security

                Fido supports up to 99 seperate message and file
        areas. There are "privelege levels" for each Fido command,
        each user, and each area. These can be intermixed to allow
        free access to all areas, limited access to some areas, or
        locking each user into a specific area.

                Fido logs information about it's use continuously;
        each users access and their activity, mail systet activity,
        and statistics on overall system use.

        F_i_d_o_N_e_t_

                Fido also contains a true electronic mail and
        networking system, (FidoNet) using ordinary phone lines. Up
        to 250 physically seperate Fido systems may be
        interconnected for message and file transfers, under
        automatic control. Each of the 250 Fido systems can be a
        host, with up to 250 connected to it.

                Fidonet is a true, full featured electronic mail
        network. It supports host systems, message forwarding and
        routing, and cost accounting.

                Routing and forwarding can be used to direct mail
        for one or more Fido systems to a different Fido system,
        which will later send it on to the correct destination.

                FidoNet can be configured to use a centralized host,
        or an amorphous network of independent systems for higher
        reliability.

                Cost accounting is done on a user by user basis, for
        each message entered. (By Jan 85 it will also have host to
        host charge reversals.)

                If you are really lucky, this manual will help you
        create and customize a Fido Bulletin Board system to your
        liking. If you are not lucky, you will become hopelessly
        lost and confused. This can be summed up as:

                "Don't let you mouth write no check your tail can't
        cash."

                Which means that I don't promise that these manuals
        are useful, never mind good, though what little information
        you find should be accurate, if a bit poorly organized and
        hard to find.

                Or:

                "These manuals stink!"

                As one sysop succinctly put forth. This is the third
        and most extensive major rewrite of the Fido documentation,
        and may even be better than the previous attempts. To help
        things further, Fido itself seems to have stabilized, making
        the job easier.








































        Fido's Operating Manual T. Jennings 1 Nov 84            Page 6
        S_t_e_p_ B_y_ S_t_e_p_ I_n_s_t_a_l_l_a_t_i_o_n_


                Fido is a software system, not just a single
        program. Besides the program itself, Fido requires a number
        of disk files, subdirectories or other disks to hold
        messages and downloadable files, and obviously a modem and
        cable.

                While Fido requires many disk files to run properly,
        almost all of them are created and maintained by Fido
        itself. The exceptions are the batch file to actually run
        Fido, the welcome messages and other text messages that Fido
        can display, and various other lists and messages. These are
        covered in detail later.

                You can think of Fido as having an i_n_s_i_d_e_ and an
        o_u_t_s_i_d_e_. The i_n_s_i_d_e_ is what you can change and see by
        running the Fido program. These are things such as setting
        up message and file areas, privelege levels for the various
        commands, scheduled events such as FidoNet, and the like.
        These are all accessed by Fido commands.

                The o_u_t_s_i_d_e_ consists of the MSDOS batch file,
        subdirectories for the message and file areas, signon and
        welcome messages that the system operator creates, and the
        modem system. While these are of course used by Fido
        (messages are displayed, modem is used to answer and dial,
        etc) they cannot be created or modified from within Fido.

                Simply put, there are four stages to follow to get
        Fido properly installed. These are:

        (1)     T_h_e_ E_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t_:
                Making subdirectories, formatting blank diskettes if
        necessary, determining how many and where to put the message
        and file areas.

        (2)     I_n_s_i_d_e_:
                Running Fido from the local keyboard (instead of the
        modem) in order to set up Fido to match the environment you
        created. Fido must be told about each message and file area
        subdirectory or diskette set up earlier.

        (3)     O_u_t_s_i_d_e_:
                Customizing the batch file to run Fido from; this
        contains the command line parameters for users time limits,
        and other operating details. 

        (4)     H_a_r_d_w_a_r_e_:
                Making the modem go. Up to this point, the modem is
        not needed at all, and can be ignored. If you have a modem
        already connected and running with a communications program,
        then this step is easy.











        Fido's Operating Manual T. Jennings 1 Nov 84            Page 7
        S_t_e_p_ 1_:_ S_e_t_t_i_n_g_ U_p_ M_e_s_s_a_g_e_ a_n_d_ F_i_l_e_ A_r_e_a_s_


                The first step is to figure out what you want your
        system to look like. This depends on your needs, your
        hardware (mainly, how much disk space do you have) and the
        neeeds of your users. 

                It is not possible to cover all the combinations
        that Fido can be configured in, and the one you end up with
        will probably change as your needs change. Therefore, this
        manual will cover a single simple configuration; others are
        set up in the same way, and once it is understood, is fairly
        straightforward.


                If you follow this installation guide exactly, you
        will end up with a Fido Bulletin Board system that has the
        following characteristics:

                - A public access system

                - Two independent Message Areas

                - Two independent File Areas

                - An additional, special Message Area where users
                  can find special messages from the system 
                  operator.

                - Ready to be used with a DC Hayes SmartModem 1200B

                Any and all of this can be modified, either now (if
        you are confident) or later, after you get this example one
        running. While this manual is arranged in the order covered
        in the introduction, you may actually perform any steps in
        any order; however, this order has been found, by trial and
        error, to be the simplest and easiest to follow.



























        Fido's Operating Manual T. Jennings 1 Nov 84            Page 8
        S_t_e_p_ 2_:_ T_h_e_ E_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t_


                Choose how you want your disk(s) laid out. If you
        have a hard disk, then use that; create a single
        subdirectory in the root, called FIDO (or whatever) log into
        it, and perform the steps below from within it.

        CD \                            log into the root
        MD FIDO                         make a FIDO directory
        CD FIDO                         enter the FIDO directory


                If you have two floppies, you should format two new
        diskettes, and make one bootable (format it with /S, to
        install the system on it). This will become your A:
        diskette. On it, put the minimum tools you will need: some
        sort of editor or word processor (for making welcome
        messages, etc) and the fido .EXE files. Put the other
        formatted diskette in B:.

                For all systems, you should set the number of
        BUFFERS in CONFIG.SYS on the booted diskette. The
        performance increase will be enormous. If you do NOT do
        this, then your Fido system will run very slowly, and annoy
        all of your users. If you know how to use CONFIG.SYS, then
        just do it. If not, then on your b_o_o_t_ d_i_s_k_ do the following:

        CD \                            log into the root
        COPY CON CONFIG.SYS             copy keyboard to CONFIG.SYS
        BUFFERS = 50                    type this exactly,
        FILES = 20                      this too
        ^Z                              Enter Control-Z, then return

        Copied 1 file(s)                Message from MSDOS

                Next time you boot, MSDOS will read CONFIG.SYS and
        set the number of buffers to 50. (It will not do it until
        then.)

                Anyways ...

                Before even thinking about running any programs, the
        subdirectories and such need to be created. As mentioned
        above, we will end up with two message areas and two file
        areas.

                Message areas:

                        GENERAL         Msg area #1
                        TECH            Msg area #2

                File Areas:

                        IBMPC           File area #1
                        CPM80           File Area #2

                Special Areas:







        Fido's Operating Manual T. Jennings 1 Nov 84            Page 9
        S_t_e_p_ 2_:_ T_h_e_ E_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t_


                        ANSWERS         Special Msg area


                First, create these subdirectories using the MD or
        MKDIR command:

        MD GENERAL
        MD TECH
        MD IBMPC
        MD CPM80
        MD ANSWERS

                Now the subdirectories exist on your disk. These are
        where Fido will put messages and files that can be accessed
        by users. (Of course, there areen't any yet, don't worry
        about it.)

                Now for a tedious part. Now you must log into each
        area, and make a file called DIR.BBS. This is a very small
        file, and contains a one line description of what the
        subdirectory is for. (No, Fido cannot read; this small
        description is merely displayed to a user when they log into
        an area.)

                This can be done with your word processor, or more
        simply with the COPY command.

        CD GENERAL                      enter the GENERAL subdir
        COPY CON DIR.BBS                make DIR.BBS
        General Interest Messages       one line descrption
        ^Z                              Control-Z, then ENTER

        1 File(s) Copied                MSDOS message to you
        CD ..                           log into previous subdir

                Repeat this for each area above, entering the
        description for each, instead of the "General Interest
        Messages" in the example above. 

                At this point, you have made all the basic
        subdirectories for Fido. Changes or additions can be made
        later, following the same basic steps. 




















        Fido's Operating Manual T. Jennings 1 Nov 84            Page 10
        S_t_e_p_ 3_:_ S_t_a_r_t_i_n_g_ F_i_d_o_


                Now that the basic subdirectories have been made,
        you must run Fido and tell it where to find them. There is
        one last step before you do this; it is to make sure that
        Fido has the minimum files it needs to run.

                While they are not absolutely necessary to run, the
        HELP files are handy, since you probably havent memorized
        all the Fido commands yet. All that needs to be done is to
        copy them into the HELP directory, created above.

                While logged into the main FIDO directory, or the
        root for floppy systems, put the Fido distribution diskette
        into B:, and:

                COPY B:*.HLP 

                You also need as a minimum the initial user list,
        USER.BBS, and the initial system file, SYSTEM.BBS. You will
        also need the Fido program, of course. Copy these from the
        distribution diskette, to the Fido subdirectory.

                COPY B:USER.BBS
                COPY B:SYSTEM.BBS
                COPY B:FIDO_IBM.EXE     (or _DEC for DEC, etc)

                Now, Fido has all it needs to be run. Fido has many
        command line options, which are covered in a later section.
        Here, you need only one:

                /T              Test Mode

        FIDO_IBM /T             (or _DEC for DEC, etc)

                After a few seconds, you will see the signon
        message, and a prompt for your name. You will NOT see any
        nice welcome messages and so on; these are created later.

                At the prompt for your name, fill in as follows:

        Your FIRST Name: SYSOP <enter>
        Your  LAST Name: <enter>
        Wait ...
        Password: WHAT <enter>

                When you enter the password, it will be displayed as
        dots, for security reasons. After some messages from Fido,
        you will be at the MAIN Command prompt. 

                There are a number of commands that do NOT show up
        in the prompt. These are the sysop commands, and are the
        digits 1 to 9. Only a user with SYSOP priveleges may use
        them. (The initial user list contains one user, named SYSOP,
        whose privelege level is also SYSOP.)









        Fido's Operating Manual T. Jennings 1 Nov 84            Page 11
        S_t_e_p_ 4_:_ S_e_t_t_i_n_g_ U_p_ A_r_e_a_s_

                The sysop-only commands are covered in detail in
        elsewhere; however the minimum needed information will be
        provided here.

                Fido keeps track of message and file subdirectories
        by storing them in small lists. Each list contains one
        Message Area subdirectory, one File Area subdirectory, and
        one HELP subdirectory (not used here). There can be up to 99
        lists. When a user chooses a message or file area, they are
        really choosing one of the lists.

                You must now store the names of the subdirectories
        in these lists, so that Fido will know where to find them,
        and so that users can select them.

                The "1" command is used to maintain these lists. The
        lists are numbered 0 to 99; you select one by:

        1 <n>           Where <n> is a number 0 - 99

                First we set area #1, using the subdirectory names
        chosen before. (Only what you enter is shown here; Fido will
        display the Main Command prompt and other messages also.)

        1 1             Select list 1
        1 GENERAL\M     Set Message Area name
        1 IBMPC\F       Set File Download Area name
        1 IBMPC\U       Set File Upload Area
        1 S             Save the changes

                The first set of areas is now set. You can view your
        changes by entering "1" by itself.

                Now repeat this process for the second set of areas.

        1 2             Select list 2
        1 TECH\M        Set Message Area
        1 CPM80\F       Set File Download Area
        1 CPM80\U       Set File Upload Area
        1 S             Save changes

                The third list will contain only the ANSWERS message
        area, there is no corresponding File Area. This is set in
        the same way as the other areas.

        1 3             Select list 3
        1 ANSWERS\M     Set Message Area
        1 F             Set BLANK File Area
        1 U             Set BLANK Upload area
        1 S             Save the changes

                The last list to set is the "special" list, number
        0. Only the Message Area is used from this list. This area
        is where comments to the sysop go, using the G (GoodBye)
        command. Usually (and in this example) this area will be the
        same as one of the regular areas; ANSWERS in this instance.







        Fido's Operating Manual T. Jennings 1 Nov 84            Page 12

        This is so that the sysop can reply to messages left at
        GoodBye, and users can read them by choosing the ANSWER
        area.

        1 0             Select list 0
        1 ANSWERS\M     Set message area
        1 S


                At this point Fido is more or less usable in Test
        Mode (/T). You can now go into the various areas, enter
        messages and operate most of the commands. There will not be
        any files available yet, nor any messages. You should go
        through each area and make sure it is set up as you think it
        is.

        M_e_s_s_a_g_e_ A_r_e_a_s_

                From the MAIN Command prompt, use M to enter the
        Message Section. Check that you have the names of the
        message areas (subdirectories) set properly. The A command
        displays the message areas available, and lets you choose
        one. You should see three areas, and the small descriptions
        you entered previously. If not, something is wrong; go back
        over the previous steps and check. Probably just an
        incorrectly entered name. If all is well, pick one of the
        areas, for example "1" for area #1, GENERAL.

                Use the E command to enter a sample message. After
        saving it, it should say "Saving your message". If it does
        not, but says "DISK FULL: Cannot save your message" it is
        either that you disk is really full (not likely at this
        point!) or the subdirectory name you entered is incorrect.
        You must manually create, with the MSDOS MKDIR command, the
        subdirectories where Fido expects to find them.

                Return to the MAIN Command prompt, then enter the
        Files Section, and check the areas there, using the A
        command as before. You should see the area descriptions.
        Note however, that there will not be any files for
        downloading.

                The software is more or less ready to be used. At
        this point, there are a number of options. The sections you
        need are listed below; be sure to browse through the others
        for ideas and tips.

                There are a number of text files that Fido will
        display at various points; welcome messages, the initial
        signon, the bulletins and so forth. You will need to
        customize them to your taste, or delete them if they areen't
        needed. Fido does not require the presence of any of these,
        though you should probably use most of them.

                These are the ones in common with all Fido setups.
        There is a section for each configuration: public access,
        private, and semiprivate.

        WELCOME1.BBS

                This is the first text that a user sees, after
        determining baud rate by hitting the CR or ENTER key. Most
        of the public Fidos use the "doggie", already provided on
        the distribution diskette.

        WELCOME2.BBS

                Presented after a user enters their name and
        password. Just a chance to give logged in users news or
        other information. Many systems run without WELCOME2.BBS.

        BULLETIN.BBS

                Usually where frequently changing information is
        posted, for all user to see. This bulletin can also be read
        with the B (Bulletin) command from the MAIN Command prompt.

        EDTORIAL.BBS

                Similar to BULLETIN.BBS, except Fido does not
        display it automatically. It can be accessed by the E
        command from the Main Section.



























        Fido's Operating Manual T. Jennings 1 Nov 84            Page 15
        M_a_k_i_n_g_ a_ P_u_b_l_i_c_ S_y_s_t_e_m_


                When set up as in the previous sections, Fido is by
        default a public access system. However, there are special
        files that you can use to make life easier for you and your
        users.

        NEWUSER1.BBS

                This is displayed once for new users, just before
        Fido requests their city and state, and to choose a
        password. It should probably explain the need for a
        password, etc.

        NEWUSER2.BBS

                This is displayed right after a new user enters
        their city, state, and password. Usually, a simple tutorial
        of the system, what to expect, where to find things.



                If a previously logged in user forgets their
        password, after three attempts at entering a password, and
        no match is found, then there are a few options.

                The presence or absence of QNOPWD.BBS, a special
        questionaire, determines how Fido treats new users. 


        OPTION 1: LEAVE A MESSAGE TO THE SYSOP

                Make sure that you do not have a file named
        QNOPWD.BBS; if it exists, then Option 2 will be used.

                NOPWD.BBS is displayed, then they get to leave a
        message to the sysop, identical to when a logged in user
        uses the "G" command to leave a comment. After leaving a
        comment, they are logged off. They have 10 minutes (or the
        specified /S value) to complete the message.


        OPTION 2: FILL OUT A QUESTIONAIRE
        OPTION 3: MESSAGE THEN LOG OFF

                For these two options, QNOPWD.BBS is used. This is a
        special file, a questionaire. Briefly, a questionaire causes
        Fido to ask the user questions contained in it, and records
        the answers (in this case) in ANOPWD.BBS. If used, you
        should look at this file daily to check for new users. You
        can delete it whenever necessary, Fido will create a new
        one.

                Alternatively, QNOPWD.BBS can contain only text to
        be displayed, and no questions at all. Usually, this is the
        easiest thing to do; just tell them to log on again, but use
        a new name and password.

                If QNOPWD.BBS exists, the user gets to fill it out
        (or not) and is then logged off; they do not get to leave a
        message to the sysop as in Option 1.

                If you want to run a public board, but restrict new
        users, this can be easily done.

        COMMAND LINE SWITCH:

                /P      New Users get DISGRACE privelege


                When new users log on, they are assigned DISGRACE
        privelege. Then, by using the "3" command to set the
        privelege level for the Fido commands, you can restrict the
        commands available to new users. For instance, they can read
        messages, but not enter any, not be able to change their
        name or password, access the file area or the message area,
        or any other Fido command.

                If you use this method, then new users have to be
        upgraded manually, using the SYSOP utility program.

                Other than the new users privelege level, the is
        identical to a public system.









































        Fido's Operating Manual T. Jennings 1 Nov 84            Page 18

                After following the previous steps to get Fido up as
        a public system, follow these to make it a private system.

                A private system is one where only already existing
        callers can log on; new callers are prevented from entering
        the system. You can let new callers leave a message to the
        sysop, fill out a questionaire, or merely log them off, with
        or without a messaeg as to why.

                When running a private system, callers must be
        entered manually, using the SYSOP utility program. Operation
        of SYSOP is covered elsewhere.

                The presence or absence of QNOPWD.BBS, a special
        questionaire, determines how Fido treats new users. 


        COMMAND LINE SWITCH:

        /M              Private System

                Add this switch to the command line in RUNBBS.BAT.
        It prevents new users from being added to the user list.


        OPTION 1: NEW USERS CAN LEAVE A MESSAGE TO THE SYSOP

                Make sure that you do not have a file named
        QNOPWD.BBS; if it exists, then Option 2 will be used.

                This is one way in which you can make new users
        request entry to your system; NOPWD.BBS is displayed, then
        they get to leave a message to the sysop, identical to when
        a logged in user uses the "G" command to leave a comment.
        After leaving a comment, they are logged off. They have 10
        minutes (or the specified /S value) to complete the message.

                NOPWD.BBS is just a text file, that is displayed to
        new users, or users that forgot their password. In it, you
        can explain that this is a private system, and request that
        they enter whatever information you require.


        OPTION 2: NEW USERS FILL OUT A QUESTIONAIRE
        OPTION 3: NEW USERS GET LOGGED OFF IMMEDIATELY

                For these two options, QNOPWD.BBS is used. This is a
        special file, a questionaire. Briefly, a questionaire causes
        Fido to ask the user questions contained in it, and records
        the answers (in this case) in ANOPWD.BBS. You should look at
        this file daily to check for new users. You can delete it
        whenever necessary, Fido will create a new one.

                Alternatively, QNOPWD.BBS can contain only text to
        be displayed, and no questions at all. This is frequently

        used to tell users that the system is totally private, and
        access to it cannot be had.

                If QNOPWD.BBS exists, the user gets to fill it out
        (or not) and is then logged off; they do not get to leave a
        message to the sysop as in Option 1.

                The modem should be installed ONLY after the
        software is ready for it. There is no need for a modem for
        configuring the software.

                In order to test Fido and the modem, you will need a
        second computer and modem. This may be difficult, but is the
        only way by which to test the modem. Any modem and computer
        or terminal may be used; all you require is some sort of
        communications program to call your Fido with.


                For IBM PC versions, you can use a command line
        switch to select either COM1 or COM2. The default is COM1.
        If you need to use COM2, add to your command line in
        RUNBBS.BAT:

                /2              COM2


                Later on there is a section of modem/computer
        combinations that have worked in other installations. If
        your system is in there, you're all set. Probably a good
        idea to read on anyways, so you'll know whats going on.

                It is entirely possible you will have to modify your
        modem cable or replace it; even if you have a modem/comm/
        program combination that works, it may not have all the
        lines needed to operate a bulletin board. The extra lines
        are Carrier Detect (CD) and Data Terminal Ready (DTR). These
        two are not normally needed by most communications programs;
        they are however needed by Bulletin Boards, since they need
        to be able to detect incoming calls and to force them to
        disconnect.

        USING A STANDARD CABLE:
                You can change the RS232 pin that Fido uses to
        determine the state of the Carrier Detect signal. This is
        done with the /V switch; see the section on switches, and
        the section on M_o_d_e_m_s_, next.

             No /V switch at all is the same as entering:

                  16/V      default

                If you have a DC Hayes Smartmodem, connected to an
        IBM Async Card via a one-to-one cable, then you should run
        Fido with no /V, or possibly:

                     128/V          or        (RLSD)
                      32/V                    (DSR)


             When Fido is first run, and there is no caller
        connected, Fido will say:








        Fido's Operating Manual T. Jennings 1 Nov 84            Page 21
        I_n_s_t_a_l_l_i_n_g_ t_h_e_ M_o_d_e_m_

        (1)     Waiting for a Call or Event

                When a connection is made, within 2 seconds, you
        should see:

        (2)     Incoming call
                Determining Baud Rate

                If Fido does not sit there and wait for a carrier
        (1), but immediately says (2), then you have selected the
        wrong /V bit. If it says (1) like it's supposed to, but
        never acknowledges a connection, then you have it wrong
        also.

                Legal values for /V are: 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128.

        Custom Cabling:

                The idea here is to connect the cable such that you
        can not only communicate to the modem, but also get to the
        Carrier Detect signal from it. If you already have MINITEL,
        PC-TALK, etc working with the modem, thats a good start, but
        not enough. The Carrier Detect line is not needed by
        programs such as MINITEL and PC-TALK; Fido needs it to tell
        when a caller has made a connection, or when they have hung
        up. Just because PC-TALK or MINITEL work with the modem
        doesnt mean that Fido will.

                The following are the pins that must be wired to an
        IBM Async Card. You will have to determine how to connect
        other computers using this as an example.

        IBM PC                  SMARTMODEM              USE
        1                       1               Ground, 
        2 Rx Data               2               Data, modem to PC
        3 Tx Data               3               Data, PC to modem,
        6 Carrier Detect        6               Carrier Detect 
        20 Data Terminal Ready  20              Cause Disconnect

                The other pins are not needed by Fido, though may be
        needed by other comm. programs, and in any case can be left
        in.

                CD is generated by the modem, and tells the computer
        (Fido) that a call came in, and a connection made.
        Conversly, Fido can tell when a caller hangs up or loses
        connection, and knows to log that user off.

                Fido uses this to disconnect users that have gone
        over their limit, and to prevent incoming calls while Fido
        is performing internal processing that may take a few

        minutes.

                DTR is also of extreme importance for FidoNet for
        placing outgoing calls. Fido will not run properly if DTR is
        not connected and working properly.

             There are three things that control how the modem is
        used:

             n/J                Modem Type 
             n/V                Bit Flag, for testing Carrier Detect
             FIDOMDM.BBS        Command file for the modem

             Between these three, Fido can accomodate almost any
        modem type. This section covers most popular modems, with
        specific settings for each of the above.

             FIDOMDM.BBS is a special, optional, file that Fido uses
        to command the modem. If it does not exist, then it is not
        used. For some modems, it is not needed.

             When Fido is first run, any commands in FIDOMDM.BBS are
        sent line by line, to put the modem into a state where it is
        useful for Fido and FidoNet. There is no limit to the length
        or contents of this file; the only thing Fido does is send
        out each line, and wait up to 3 seconds for a response from
        the modem. (To avoid sending them out too fast.)

                For external Smartmodem type modems, it's usually
        easier to set the switches to make it autoanswer. For
        internal modems that do not have switches, you have to do it
        with FIDOMDM.BBS.

             The /J modem type switch tells Fido how to handle the
        modem. If not specified, it defaults to 1/J, Hayes or
        compatible. Select other values for other type modems. If
        you do not set this right, Fido may still work, however,
        FidoNet will not when it tries to dial to other systems. 

             Most of this information was compiled by Jim Ryan,
        sysop of Fido #9.

             If you do not see your modem here, try various
        settings. If you have a comm program such as PCTALK running,
        all you need to do is get it to autoanswer; see the D_._ C_._
        H_a_y_e_s_ 1_2_0_0_B_ I_n_t_e_r_n_a_l_ M_o_d_e_m_. That should work for most Hayes
        type modems.

        I_n_ G_e_n_e_r_a_l_:

                For Hayes type modems, the idea is to set the
        following:

                Carrier Detect follows true Carrier
                Data Terminal Ready enabled
                Autoanswer on the first ring
                Numeric Result codes
                Turn loudspeaker off always (annoying)

             This is the easiest modem to use; besides being
        "compatible" (being the one everyone copies) it also
        performs flawlessly. It's manual is a bit technical and
        terse, but is complete and bugfree. It performs well both
        because of it's software and it's high quality analog phone
        line circuitry.

             If you can afford it, dollar for dollar, this is one of
        the best modem buys. You cannot go wrong with an external
        Hayes modem.

             This so called "Hayes compatible" is one of the poorest
        modems ever made; it is barely compatible, and
        unfortunately, cannot be used for Fido, nor many other comm.
        type programs.

             It will work OK at 1200 baud, but not at 300. For some
        unknown reason, the modem transmits all characters at 1200
        baud, even when connected at 300. While it sounds like it
        simplifies things, by not having to switch baud rates, it
        also means that you must "throttle" data sent to it; you
        cannot just send data at 1200 baud to the modem, when it is
        leaving the modem at only 300 baud.

             This has so many basic flaws that no attempt will be
        made at making Fido accomodate it.

        answer the phone.

                You must tell the modem to autoanswer, either by a
        switch setting (if applicable) or via a command in
        FIDOMDM.BBS. See the Modem installation section.



        SYMPTOM:
                Fido says "Waiting for a call or event", immediately
        followed by "Incoming call, determining baud rate" when
        there is no incoming call.

                You have the modem installed incorrectly. The
        problem is that Fido thinks that there is Carrier Detected
        when there isnt. You probably have the /V value wrong. If
        the one reccomended above does not work, try the others.
        There are eight possible values; 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128. 

                For Hayes type modems, there may be a switch to
        cause CD to be "faked". This switch must be set for true
        carrier detect.

                A third possibility is that you have a "non
        standard" cable, and pin 6 or 8 is not wired. If that is the
        case, you will have to repair or replace the cable.



        SYMPTOM:
                Fido rings the bell continuously, displaying the
        message "CANNOT DISCONNECT THE MODEM!".

                Fido requires that it be able to cause a disconnect
        by using the DTR line. The Anchor Automation modem does not
        support DTR, and therefore cannot be used with Fido.

                For modems with options switches, it may be merely a
        switch setting to enable the use of the DTR line.

                This can also be caused by a modem cable that does
        not have all the connections made.

                If you see this message, you can type Control-C to
        abort it. You should also make sure the modem is
        disconnected until you can repair this situation.

        SYMPTOM:
           
                Fido detects the wrong baud rate.
                Fido gets (or gives) garbage to the modem

             For Hayes type modems, you probably have WORD RESULT

        CODES set, and Fido thinks that this is being typed by
        someone who just called in. See the modem section on
        commanding your modem to give numeric result codes.

                A sure symptom of this is if you see a user name of
        CONNECT when you look at the screen.

             This can also happen with poor modem designs, such as
        the Bizcomp modem.

                To further customize Fido, you can change the
        privelege level needed to operate each of the commands. This
        is done with the 3 command (covered in detail in F_i_d_o_'_s_
        O_p_e_r_a_t_i_n_g_ M_a_n_u_a_l_).

                Entering 3 by itself lists the current settings.
        Each command area has it's own privelege tables: 

                Main Section,           MAINPRIV.BBS
                Message Sections,       MSGPRIV.BBS
                Mail Sections,          MAILPRIV.BBS
                File Sections,          FILEPRIV.BBS
                Read Command Prompt     READPRIV.BBS
                CHANGE Command Prompt   CHGPRIV.BBS

                For example, you can change the Raw-Display command
        in the file areas to be NORMAL, and let everyone use it, or
        you can make the EnterMessage command in the Message areas
        PRIVEL, so that new callers (first time callers) cannot
        enter messages until you up their privelege level with the
        SYSOP.EXE program. (They can always leave Messages to the
        Sysop at Goodbye.)

                Briefly, to change a command privelege, enter:

                3 <x> <priv.>

                Where:

                <x>     Is the command letter, as entered normally
        to Fido. (E for Enter message, K for Kill, etc.)

                <priv.> Is one of the Fido privelege levels below.
        You MUST spell it out fully.

                TWIT            Lowest
                DISGRACE
                NORMAL

                There are a number of things you can do that make
        Fido faster. If you have enough memory for a memory disk,
        put the messages in it. This will speed things up by a
        factor of ten or so. Dont worry about the .BBS files or .HLP
        files; they are small and infrequently accessed. The
        downloadable files are generally too large, and again,
        areent accessed in a way that they speed up from a memory
        disk.

                Also, you should use a large number of FILES and
        BUFFERS in CONFIG.SYS. This is probably the limiting speed
        factor in most systems without memory disks. Use the maximum
        FILES = 20, (each "file" takes only 36 bytes, so dont worry
        about that) and lots of buffers. The following is an
        example:

        FILES = 20
        BUFFERS = 50

                More than 70 buffers or so starts to actually slow
        the system down, as DOS spends all of its time fiddling
        around with the buffers.

                If you run out of memory, then lower the number of
        buffers. Buffers are 512 (1/2 K) bytes each on IBM PC type
        machines.

        IMPORTANT NOTE:
                MSDOS is not too smart about checking for enough
        memory when you use BUFFERS = . The actual buffers arent
        allocated until they are needed; if at that time there isnt
        enough memory, then you get the message:

                "Insufficient Memory"

                And the system halts, making you reboot. Make sure
        you have enough memory. 40 to 50 buffers is plenty, and will
        work fine with 256K of memory.


                Use GOOD diskettes. If you get a disk error, the
        user will just see the system hung, and the "... error"
        "Retry Ignore Abort" message on the local console. Not good.

             Initially, use the RUNBBS.BAT batch file from the
        distribution set of files. Modify it to include any switches
        needed. Later on, you can include other things for system
        maintenance, using the scheduler. See the scheduler section
        for that.



             When Fido terminates to DOS, it returns an ERRORLEVEL,
        that can be detected from within RUNBBS.BAT. Some of the
        ERRORLEVEL values are built into Fido; others can be set by







        Fido's Operating Manual T. Jennings 1 Nov 84            Page 32
        H_i_n_t_s_ a_n_d_ T_i_p_s_

        the sysop. The fixed ones are:

                1         Control-C from console or stack overflow
                2         Fido Disk File error
                3         Other fatal errors

                If there is some fatal error, you'd probably like to
        see it, and in any case there's not any sense in running
        again. Also, you have to type Control-C on the local console
        to terminate Fido (for maintainance, etc) and this causes it
        to terminate the batch file.

                The Fido software is not prone to crashing. Most
        troubles will be hardware ones, or power failures and
        brownouts. The system cannot be crashed by callers hanging
        up at random points, and there is no way in which debuggers
        can be run, etc. 


        WARNING:

                Beware of other programs such as NEWKEY, pop up
        alarm clocks, SIDE KICK, automatic screen blank programs,
        and anything like them. None of them are compatible with any
        program that makes extensive use of interrupts, such as
        Fido.

                Most of the programs do illegal things with the
        hardware, and will bomb Fido, and other systems. You may
        never have problems; probably you will, but it may take
        hours or days to show up. One symptom is that the system
        just "stops". If in doubt, start the system up again; if it
        happens again, reboot again, this time leaving out any such
        program, and see if that cures it. It may take several days
        to discover.

                It is recommended that you do not use such programs
        while running Fido.

                There are a number of ways you can run your Files
        Section, if you have one at all. You can of course combine
        the features any way you want, but here are some common
        ones:

        OPTION 1: FREE ACCESS UPLOAD AND DOWNLOAD

                Users can upload and download files at will. New
        files are uploaded into the same area and added to the files
        list, so that they are available immediately.

        OPTION 2: FREE ACCESS DOWNLOAD, UPLOAD BY SUBMISSION

                Users can download any file, but newly uploaded
        files cannot be downloaded until the sysop allows it. There
        are two ways to do this.


                These are accomplished with three things:

        File Download Path      In the list of areas
        File Upload Path        In the list of areas
        FILES.BBS               The files list

                The upload and download paths are accessed by the
        "1" command, as mentioned before. FILES.BBS is a special
        file in each file area, that contains the list of available
        files.

                Before describing the Options above, here is some
        information:

                FILES.BBS is the list in each Files area of the
        files available for downloading. You must create the first
        one, but it can be automatically updated in a number of ways
        later.

                FILES.BBS is basically just a text file, that
        contains the names and a description. Fido puts in the file
        size, and aligns the columns neatly. For instance:

        (Sample Files display)

        AFILE.EXE      4545 Just a sample file.
        PROG.BIN  323432434 A very large file
        FOO.FIZ     MISSING Another sample

        (The actual FILES.BBS contents)

        AFILE.EXE Just a sample file.
        PROG.BIN A very large file
        FOO.FIZ Another sample.

                You must enter the names as shown; the DOS DIR
        format (FILE     EXT) will not work, it must be (FILE.EXT).







        Fido's Operating Manual T. Jennings 1 Nov 84            Page 34
        F_i_l_e_s_ S_e_c_t_i_o_n_ O_r_g_a_n_i_z_a_t_i_o_n_

        Note that if a file is really missing (not in the directory)
        the file size will say MISSING instead.

                There are special lines within FILES.BBS, that
        control how it is listed by the various commands. The
        special lines are determined by the first character. They
        are:

        - This is a comment only line
         So is this (starts with a space)
        @ This is the "end" of the files list.

                The first two are merely comments; you can use them
        for whatever you wish. The third is a special marker, and
        tells Fido to not list anything after this line, including
        this line. 

                When a file is uploaded, Fido asks for a one line
        description for that file. The filename and description is
        added to the END of the files list, above.

                If there is a line beginning with @, then the new
        files are added after it. Since nothing is listed beyond
        this point, these files are not listed, and are esentially
        unavailable until the sysop edits FILES.BBS and deletes the
        line containing the @, or moves it past the last file in the
        list. This lets the sysop check out uploaded files before
        making them available.

        U_p_l_o_a_d_i_n_g_ a_n_d_ D_o_w_n_l_o_a_d_i_n_g_

                As mentioned before, Fido has an u_p_l_o_a_d_ and a
        d_o_w_n_l_o_a_d_ path. The "F" command lists the files in the
        d_o_w_n_l_o_a_d_ path, using the FILES.BBS list there.

                U_p_l_o_a_d_e_d_ files go into the u_p_l_o_a_d_ path, and their
        names and descriptions are added to the FILES.BBS list in
        the u_p_l_o_a_d_ path.

                If the u_p_l_o_a_d_ and d_o_w_n_l_o_a_d_ paths are the SAME, then
        Fido will not let an uploaded file replace (or destroy ...)
        an already existing downloadable file. This prevents good
        files from accidentally being destroyed or changed.

                If the u_p_l_o_a_d_ and d_o_w_n_l_o_a_d_ paths are DIFFERENT, then
        Fido will let existing files be overwritten. Usually this
        means there is a seperate upload area, not accessible to
        users.

                You can use the above characteristics to your
        advantage. Instead of trying to describe them all, here are
        three examples.


        OPTION 1: FREE ACCESS UPLOAD AND DOWNLOAD








        Fido's Operating Manual T. Jennings 1 Nov 84            Page 35
        F_i_l_e_s_ S_e_c_t_i_o_n_ O_r_g_a_n_i_z_a_t_i_o_n_

                Users can upload and download files at will. New
        files are uploaded into the same area and added to the files
        list, so that they are available immediately.

                Make the u_p_l_o_a_d_ and d_o_w_n_l_o_a_d_ paths the same. New
        files go into the download area. Make sure there is no @
        line in FILES.BBS; when a new file is uploaded, it's name
        and description is added to the end of the files list, where
        it is immediately available for downloading.

        OPTION 2: FREE ACCESS DOWNLOAD, UPLOAD BY SUBMISSION

                Users can download any file, but newly uploaded
        files cannot be downloaded until the sysop allows it. There
        are two ways to do this.

                        VARIATION A:

                As in Option 1, make the paths the same, but put a
        line beginning with @ in FILES.BBS. When a file is uploaded,
        it is added to the download directory, but it's name and
        description will not be displayed with the "F" command.

                This is the easiest to maintain way to do things; to
        make new files available, all you have to do is delete the
        line beginning with @, or move it to the end of the list.

                The disadvantage is that the file really is
        accessible; it just does not show. If a user knows it's
        there, it can be downloaded.


                        VARIATION B:

                Make the upload and download paths different, where
        the upload path is a disk or directory not available as a
        File Area. It doesnt matter if there is an @ line in
        FILES.BBS.

                Since new files are uploaded into a totally seperate
        area, they cannot be accessed by users. (You can put the
        path in a separate file area, with SYSOP privelege level, so
        that you can get in there to look.)

                The disadvantage is that in order to make these
        files available, you must use the DOS COPY command, and
        update the FILES.BBS in the download area manually.

                This is the most secure method, is is reccomended
        only you require absolute security on uploaded files.

                There are many command line options that control
        Fido operation. You will have to edit these into the
        batchfile that runs Fido. The switches are:

        <n>/J      Selects the type of modem you are using. <n> is a
        number that specifies the modem type:

             1/J  Hayes
             2/J  DEC DF03
             3/J  Racal Vadic VA212
             4/J  Novation/ IBM PC Junior

             See the section on modems for details.

        /T      Test mode. Described early in this manual, not used
        for a remote Fido system. Not a good thing to put into the
        batch file.

        /B      Not used anymore. 

        /M      Private message system. Please read the chapter on
        private systems.

        /P      Set the default privelege level for new users to
        DISGRACE. See the chapter on semiprivate systems for
        details.

        (number)/S     Set the time limit for logging on. This limit
        starts as soon as carrier is detected, and stops after a
        valid password is entered. At that point, the normal user or
        first time user time limit starts. The minimum is 5 minutes;
        the default is 10.

        (number)/L      Set the time limit per call to (number),
        where (number) is the number of minutes. 0 means unlimited
        use, i.e. no time limit. Must be 0 - 65535. Read a later
        section on time limits. If not specified, then the limit
        defaults to 60 minutes.

        (number)/F      Set the time limit for new users. The
        default here is 60 minutes also. You can give first time
        callers a low limit.

        (number)/D      Set the total time limit for a 24 hour
        period. This is usually 4 or 5 times the /L limit. This is
        the maximum number of minutes a caller is allowed in a 24
        hour period, and prevents long term hogging, and keeps them
        from hanging up and calling right back when the per-connect
        limit is reached. The default is 300 minutes.

        (number)/K      Limit the number of K bytes a caller can
        download in a 24 hr. period. Along with /F, /L, and /D,

        <number>/V     Define the bit used to determine the state of
        the Carrier Detect signal from the modem. The default is
        CTS, or 16. See the modem section in this manual for
        details.

        /U      Disables the file transfer information displayed
        when a file upload or download is happening. Normally, Fido
        will display status messages about each block being
        transferred, and all errors that happen. This is very useful
        when a caller is having trouble. Enter /U to disable this
        display.

        /?      Debug feature enable. The use of this varies from
        revision to revision. Frequently, it enables new functions
        that are not fully debugged, or may not be liked by users or
        sysops. 

        /R   Initialize the modem (with the command file
        FIDOMDM.BBS, if present) at 1200 baud. If /R is not present,
        it is done at 300 baud. Used mostly for DF03 modems.

        <n>/G     Sets the number of attempts with connect for
        FidoNet. The default is one. This is the number of times
        that Fido/FidoNet will call a particular number, if the
        modems connect but no mail is transferred. 

        /I      Disable the local console. This is pretty much
        useless for most installations. Usually, Fido displays what
        a user sees, on the local console. /I disables this; it can
        also be turned on and off with the local console commands ^O
        and ^N. This is used mostly with multitasking programs such
        as XAP or Multilink.


                These switches are entered thusly:

        Fido 90/l 30/f 200/k 180/d

                The above sets:

                90 minute time limit per call (normal users)
                30 minute time limit (first time callers)
                200K bytes/48 hrs download limit
                180 minutes time limit per user per 48 hrs

        /1
        /2

                Select which physical IO device to use. The default
        is /1, COM1 on the IBM PC. /2 Selects COM2. Not used on
        machines other than the IBM PC, etc yet.

                Fido has a number of HELP files, that are displayed
        by entering "?" at almost any point within Fido. There is a
        help file for each place ? can be entered. The HELP path is
        used to find the file needed. The standard Fido setup is a
        single subdirectory called HELP, which contains all the help
        files. 

                All the help files have the extention .HLP without
        exception. These are:

        MAIN.HLP        Main Section command prompt
        C.HLP           Within the C command, Main Section
        MSG.HLP         Message Section command prompt
        MQUERY.HLP      Within the R command, Message, Mail Section
        ENTERCMD.HLP    Within the E command, Message Section
        MAIL.HLP        FidoNet Mail Area command prompt
        FILES.HLP       File Section command prompt
        XFERTYPE.HLP    Within the D and U commands, File Section

                You can customize these if necessary, but at least
        initially don't worry about them.

                Once the system is up and running, you will need to
        look at messages, put files in the download display, etc.
        This should be done daily or so.

        TIMELOG.BBS and *.TLG FILES:
                These record the number of calls to your Fido.
        Please read the section on the TimeLog.

        SYSOP.LOG
                This is a record of callers and any messages they
        leave at the Goodbye command. Also in here go error
        messages (missing files, disk full, etc) These can be
        printed or whatever, then deleted. Fido will create a new
        one if it does not exist, otherwise it adds new info to the
        end. This is the most useful way to watch system activity.

        MAILER.LOG
             This is a record of all FidoNet activity. 

        USER.BBS
                This is your list of users. It grows with every new
        caller, and the SYSOP utility program can be used to
        maintain it. 

        NEW FILES
                If you use a separate upload directory, look in it
        once in a while. Copy desireable files into a download
        directory, and update FILES.BBS accordingly. Deleting them
        afterwards makes it easy to keep track of uploaded files.

        MESSAGES
                Log on to the system (via test mode or calling in)
        and read and prune as necessary. SYSOP level users can read
        all messages, private or not, and can delete anyones
        messages.

             This is a brief accounting of some of the internal only
        files that Fido can create. These are managed automatically;
        you do not need to worry about them. They are included here
        for the curious.

        NODELIST.SYS

                This file is created every time that NODELIST.BBS
        has changed since the last time Fido was run, or if
        NODELIST.SYS does not exist. 

        ROUTE.BBS

                This file controls where and how FidoNet mail is
        sent. It is described in the FidoNet section.

        MAIL.SYS

             Created and maintained by the 4 (sysop only) command,
        this is where FidoNet related info is kept. If you delete
        this, you will need to reenter the node number and mail
        paths.

        MSGPRIV.SYS
        MAILPRIV.SYS
        MAINPRIV.SYS
        FILEPRIV.SYS
        READPRIV.BBS
        CHGPRIV.BBS

             Each of these contain the names of all the normal user
        commands, and the privelege levels necessary to access them.
        One or more of these files may not exist; they are created
        only if a command privelege level is ever changed.

             Deleting these files causes the command priveleges to
        revert to their default settings.

        *.IN
        *.OUT
        *.FLO
        *.FLI

             These are working files created and usually deleted by
        FidoNet. You will never see these files, except when you
        reset or reboot in the middle of FidoNet operation.

             The .IN files are packets received from other FidoNet
        systems; they contain messages which are unpacked. The .OUT
        files are packets sent to other remote FidoNet systems. .FLO
        files are the list of files to be attached to that node; it
        may be empty. .FLI is the list of files received from a
        remote system, and may be empty or non-existent.

             These are the data structures used by Fido for various
        things. Each is described seperately. This information is
        included for informational purposes.

             The structures are fairly stable; if additions are
        made, they are always made in a backwards compatible
        fashion, usually with a version flag or some other method to
        indicate the format change. If you write utilities to work
        with these structures, you will almost always be able to
        accomodate future changes.

             All text strings: null terminated, left justified,
        lower case, first letter upper case. Only one space between
        words.

             Integers are all 16 bit twos complement, except double
        word (32 bit) integers as noted.

             Flags are implemented as bit masks in a 16 bit unsigned
        integer. All are positive true.

             Flag type items (tab expansion on/off, "More?" on/off,
        etc) are all full integer flags; Fido keeps them as 1 == on,
        0 == off, though any non-zero value means on. Please keep
        them as 1 == on for consistency.


             This is the format for each record within the users
        record. There is no explicit start or end of file markers.
        This is a very stable structure.

        struct  _usr {
             char name[36];      /* users ASCII name, */
             char city[36];      /* city and state, */

                        Edited by Ben Baker

                FidoBBS is a Bulletin Board system that takes full 
        advantage of MSDOS version 2. Most of the features were 
        modeled after the usual CBBS and RBBS software, since the 
        command system is so popular and familiar. 

                There are three help levels; the default for new
        callers is NOVICE. This provides a small menu of commands,
        and usually gives further description as commands are
        executed. 

                REGULAR is the command letter prompts, minus the
        full words, and does not tell you what command you have just
        executed. Useful for after you  understand the structure,
        but have not memorized all the command mnemonics. 

                EXPERT is just a very short command prompt; there
        are no menus or other things; prompts are very small and
        fast. Once you are very familiar with Fido, this will make
        using it very fast. 

                Regardless of help level, you can enter ? at almost
        any  point for a list of the options at that point. 

                From the Main Section, all of Fido's available
        commands can be accessed. The actual commands are described
        in detail below. Fido is arranged into three sections: 


                +-----------------------+ Change User name, etc
                |                       | Bulletins, Questionaire,
                |     Main Section      | Yell at Sysop, access to
                |                       | other Sections.
                +-----------------------+
                |                       |
                |                       |
                |                       |
        +------------------+   +-------------------+
        |                  |   |                   |
        | Message Section  |   |    File Section   |
        |                  |   |                   |
        +------------------+   +-------------------+
        Read, enter, delete     List, download,
        messages, message       upload files, change
        areas, etc.             file areas, etc.


        C_o_m_m_a_n_d_s_

                All commands in all areas are one letter, though
        some require further arguments or options. Most command
        allow entering the further arguments right after the command
        key; if not, or if not supplied, each necessary component is
        prompted for, usually with help available at each point.

                For instance, to download a file you must enter the
        D command, the download method (one of seven) then the
        filename. If you entered D, then Fido would ask for the
        download method. After that, it asks for the filename. Once
        you become familiar with it, you can enter it all as: 

                D X FILENAME.EXE 

                All on one line, skipping the prompts. This works
        for most commands. 

                All commands can be aborted with a Q or a blank
        line.  

        All Sections

                The following are commands that are available in all
        Sections.  

        G -- GoodBye 

                Logoff the system, optionally leave a private
        message to the sysop. If a message is left, it goes into the
        special message area (in system area 0) that is accessable
        only by the sysop. The usual message editor is available for
        comments. 

        S -- Statistics 

                This command lists the time on the system, time
        remaining, etc. Also, depending on the area, it will list 
        further information. 

        Files Area
                 Statistics also lists the free space left on the 
        default drive. 

        Message Area
                 Optionally lists messages to or from you.

        FidoNet Area
                 As in Message areas, and also lists FidoNet
        statistics. 

        Main Menu

                This is the section you are in after signon, right
        after the Bulletins and quotations. From here, the "system"
        type commands are accessed, such as Change user settings,
        etc. The commands accessible from here are described below. 

                M    Message Section
                F    File Section
                Y    Yell at the Sysop

                G    Goodbye, logoff

        M -- Message-Area 

                Enter the message section. From there, the message
        areas can be accessed.  

        F -- Files-Area 

                Similar to Message-Area, but where the upload and 
        download commands are.  

        A -- Answer-Questionaire 

                If there is a questionaire in the system, you get to
        fill one out with this command. A questionaire is  an text
        pseudo-language file, described in the Questionaire section. 

        C -- Change User 

                A small sub-menu of commands to change various user 
        settings, such as signon name, password, screen dimensions,
        etc.
                U    Users name
                C    City and State
                P    Password
                W    Screen Width
                L    Screen Length
                H    Help level
                M    "More?" on and off
                T    Tabs On and Off 
                N    Nulls, 0 - 20 

                You can change your name, password, city and state,
        and anything else at any time. (Unless the options were
        removed by the sysop.)

                NOTE: For security reasons, when your name is 
        changed, the entire users list is searched to make sure the
        name is unique. This is to prevent having two or more people
        with the same name.

                The screen dimensions are used by the page pauser 
        ("More?") and the message system. Messages are listed to fit
        within the set screen boundaries, and message entry is done
        via a word wrap editor. If "More?" is ON, then Fido will
        pause after each screenful. All of the command prompts are
        made to fit within this. 

                Help level is either NOVICE, REGULAR or EXPERT.
        NOVICE is the default; it causes all prompts to be displayed
        fully, and each command to be described with a one liner.







        Fido's Operating Manual T. Jennings 1 Nov 84            Page 48

        REGULAR is similar, but does not list the entire wordy
        prompt. EXPERT is almost no prompt at all. 

                "More?" on and off controls whenther Fido asks
        "More?" every screenful.  

                Tab expansion converts all tabs sent into spaces,
        for those systems that cannot handle tabs. 

                Fido can be set to send nulls after each linefeed.
        It defaults to 0 nulls. 

        B -- Bulletin 

                This just displays the signon bulletin, BULLETIN.BBS
        again. 

        E -- Editorial

                Similar to the Bulletin, (but displaying file
        EDTORIAL.BBS) but not displayed automatically.

        Y -- Yell at the Sysop

                By yelling, the caller can attempt to contact the
        sysop. It beeps for 30 seconds, and if the sysop does not
        respond by then, displays "Sysop not available".

                The sysop can chat with the user at any time. 

        U -- Users List

                Lists the names of all current callers to the
        system. Not very useful. 

        G -- Goodbye 

                Terminates the call. It is not really necessary;
        however, callers seem to get upset when they cant figure out
        how to log off, so there it is. (Its OK to just hang up.) It
        also allows entering a private message to the sysop. After
        (optionally) entering a message, it causes a disconnect,
        exactly what would have happened if the caller just hung up.

                The Message Section is accessed by the M command
        from the Main Menu. All message commands are available here.
        Return to the Main Menu is via the M command.

        L    List Messages               S    Statistics 
        I    Search for an item

        A -- Area-Change 

                Change the current message area. If an area number
        is  entered after the A, that area is selected if available.
        If not, a list of areas is displayed, from which you may
        choose one. 

                If a new area is selected, then the messages there
        are  counted (why it says "Wait ...") and if it's the first
        time you've selected that area, asks if you want to list
        mail addressed to you. Nothing happens if you select the
        same area, or blank line or Q. 

                The mail search searches all messages, newest to
        oldest, and lists: New message to you (ones you haven't 
        read yet) Old messages to you (ones you have read) and 
        messages you have entered. Typing Control-C or Control-K
        aborts the search. If there are lots of messages in any of
        the above catagories, it reminds you to Kill some. 

                The message area numbers displayed may not be 
        sequential. Each area has an associated privelege level and
        if the your privelege is not high enough, that area will not
        be displayed nor available. 

        L -- List Messages 

                Only the message headers are listed. A starting
        number is requested; this can be: 

                An ordinary number
                A number followed by + or -
                - itself. 

                If just a number is entered, messages are listed
        starting at that one, towards the highest message. 

                A number followed by + or - controls the direction 
        messages are listed in. + is redundant. - means list
        backwards; 100- then  means start listing at 100, list
        towards 1. 

                - means list from the highest message towards the 
        lowest. This is the most useful, and for some reason the
        least used. If you have called before, this is the easiest

        way to see any new messages. 

        R -- Read 

                Actually a small menu by itself. From here messages
        can  be read, entered, killed, replied to, etc. See the
        descriptions of the Kill and Enter commands for details on
        those. 

                Entering a message number reads that message. N
        (Next) reads the next highest message, and P (Previous)
        reads the next lowest message. Hitting CR repeats the
        previous N or P; if neither was used, then it defaults to P.  

                * is a special message number. It means the highest
        message number. 

                + and - are little used keys, but one of the most
        powerful message features. Messages can have, and be, 
        replies. (See R command below.) Messages created with R are 
        linked to other messages. For example, a message about an
        item for sale may have a reply. If you come across the
        original for sale message, it will say "See also #nnn, use +
        key" if it has a reply. Entering a + at this point will take
        you directly to that message. This message will say "Reply
        to #xxx, use - key". Entering - will take you back to the
        original message. 

                There is no limit to the number of messages that can 
        be linked this way. Further replies are added to the end,
        and if one in the middle (or either end) is Killed, the
        string of  messages is "patched" to maintain continuity. 

                This is my favorite feature (dreamed up by John
        Madill)  and I am slightly annoyed that no one uses it. 

                R Replies to the current message. It acts basically 
        like Entering a message, but automatically fills in the
        "To:" field, and links it into the original message. 

                You can enter "RK" to reply to a message, and kill
        it afterwards. This is extremely useful while reading your
        mail.

                If you are replying to a message in the Mail area,
        it also fills in the destination system. The message will be
        mailed out that night. 

                Please read about Entering messages, further below. 

                E enters a message in the normal fashion. 












        Fido's Operating Manual T. Jennings 1 Nov 84            Page 51

        E -- Enter a Message 

                You fill in the To:, From:, Subject: fields, etc,
        then the main body of the message. After terminating the
        message, commands can be used to save, abort, edit, etc. 

                If the area is a FidoNet Mail area, then in order to
        enter a message, you must select the system to send it to at
        the prompt. If you do not have enough credit, then Fido will
        not let you send a message to that system. If you do, then
        Fido will deduct the cost of the message from your credit. 

                Message text entry is done with a word wrap editor.
        If the screen width is set properly (C command in Main Menu)
        then this is about as close to a full screen editor as you
        can get through a modem (on current DOSs anyways.) 

                Like WordStar, text is entered continuously without
        carriage returns. Words that would go past the left edge are
        wrapped to the next line. Carriage returns can be used to
        form paragraphs as in WordStar. When entered this way, 
        later reading of a message will conform to the callers
        screen width. 

                At the Enter Message command prompt, the options
        are: 

                C for continue. Add more to the message, adding to
        the end. 

                L lists the message so far. 
                T lets you change the To: field. 
                J lets you change the subject. 
                D Deletes a line
                I Inserts a line

                E  edit a line. You enter the line number, then you 
        are prompted for the Old string (what to change) then the
        New string (what to change it to). Both old string and new
        string can be anything that you can enter, except a carriage
        return. 

                NOTE: it is possible to edit a line such that it
        goes beyond the edge of the screen. It will list correctly
        after it is saved. 

                A aborts the message. You will be asked yes or no. 

                S saves the message. The message is written out to
        disk, and the highest message number, etc is updated.

        K -- Kill 

                Deletes the message. Will not let you delete
        messages that are not To: you or From: you, unless you are
        the sysop. If the message you killed was mail to a remote
        system and it was not sent yet, you get your credit back;
        you are not charged for that message. 

        I -- Index 

                Terrible name, but too bad. Prompts you for a
        string. It then searches all messages, newest to oldest for
        the thing you enter. It looks in the "To:", "From:", or
        "Subject:" fields. If the string you enter is in any one of
        those parts of the message, the header of the message will
        be listed. 

                Typing Control-C aborts the search. An insensitive
        sliding match is done; ON matches TONY or PITON, etc. Each
        message header matching is listed, then a list of all
        matching message numbers. 

                ? will match any character. For example, if there
        are the following messages in the system: 

        #100 From: Joe Bungpop To: All Subject: Musical Instruments 

        #102  From: No Body To: W.S. Burroughs Subject: Guns 

        #200 From: All To: Board Subject: Music 

                 If you enter MUS, it will list messages 100 and
        200, as MUS is contained in the Subject: fields of both. If
        you had entered BU, then it would list messages 100 and 102,
        as it would match "Bungpop" and Burroughs". Entering B??R
        would cause #102 and #200 to be listed, as B??R matches
        BURRoughs and BOARd.

        A -- Area-Change 

                Similar to the Message Area-Change. If a valid area
        number is entered, it is selected directly, otherwise a list
        is displayed. 

                Like the message areas, there may be numbers missing 
        from the sequence. These are either blank paths or high 
        privelege areas. 

         L -- Locate 

                Given a file specifier (wildcards reccommended) it
        searches through all file directories for the filename, and
        lists all occurences of it. L;*.ASM lists all .ASM files in
        all areas, etc. L;*.* lists all files everywhere.

                This is not the general purpose list-files command. 

        F --- Files 

                Lists the files in the current directory. If no
        specifier is given, it lists all files, otherwise only
        matching ones. The size of the file and the description is
        displayed after the filename. 

                If "MISSING" is displayed instead of the file size,
        then the file is not there, even though it is listed.

        T -- Type 

                Very simple. Displays an ASCII file on the screen.
        It  statistically checks the file to make sure it is a text
        file. 

        U -- Upload 

                Upload a file or files to Fido. I will not even
        attempt to document all the upload methods. Suffice to say
        you select the upload method and do it.

                The total uploads made is kept in the user record. 
        These count towards further downloads, by effectively 
        raising the download limit on a 1 for 1 basis. It will not
        give you credit however. There is no limit on uploads. 

                After all files are uploaded, you are asked to
        describe each one; this is added to the list of files. (You
        may not be able to see the newly added files though.)

        D -- Download 

                Again, pick the method and do it. Before the
        download  starts, Fido checks time limits and K byte limits,
        and prevents too long downloads. Uploading will remove some
        of the download limit.

                Control characters are used by Fido for editing
        command lines, pausing and aborting commands. Control- C and
        Control- K always are identical and have the same effect: 

                Control-C Aborts anything
                Control-K Aborts anything 

                Control-S pauses the display. Any key except a
        second Control-S will let it continue. 

                When not using the word wrap message editor, Fido
        allows simple editing of command lines. It assumes the your
        or computer terminal can support at least backspace. It
        supports: 

                ^C, ^X, ^U, ^Y

                 Delete the entire line. 

                ^R

                Restore the previous line, from last use or
        deletion. (Most useful.) 

                ^S, ^G, ^H, DEL

                Delete one character to the left. 

                ^D

                 Restore one character. 

                ESC, CR, LF

                 Enter the line.

             The sysop commands are all single digits, and do not
        show up in any prompts nor in any of the supplied help
        files. Most are "dangerous", in the sense that they set and
        change Fidos environment, and are not for general use.

                With one exception, all sysop commands are available
        at all prompts. This exception is at the "Read Command"
        prompt; entering numbers specifies a message number, not a
        command! Therefore, the 3 command (see below) is accessed
        only here as "#".

        1_ -_-_ P_a_t_h_s_

             Sets paths, select and create new system files
        (SYSTEMn.BBS) and change the privelege level for each area.

             Entering 1 by itself lists the contents of the current
        system file. Changing and setting system file parameters is
        done by entering them after the 1, in a slightly peculiar
        way. The 1 commands are:

        (a)  1 <number>         Select or create a system file.
        (b)  1 <pathname>\M     Set the MSG Path
        (c)  1 <pathname>\F     Set the FILE Path
        (d)  1 <pathname>\U     Set the UPLOAD Path
        (e)  1 <pathname>\H     Set the HELP Path
        (g)  1 <privelege>\V    Set the Area Privelege level
        (h)  1 <number>\A       Set Attributes
        (i)  1 S                Save the changes
        (j)  1 ?                Get HELP! With the 1 command

             If (a) is not done, then the system file is the one
        last selected when in a Message Section or File Section. You
        can always find out by just entering 1 by itself; it lists
        which system file and all its contents.

             To create a new system file, enter 1 <number>, where
        <number> is one higher than the highest one. Fido will not
        allow creating SYSTEM99.BBS, for instance, when the current
        highest is only 8. When a new one is created, it copies the
        contents of the current one into the new one.

             For (b) through (e), the specified path is selected.
        You can check your changes by entering 1 by itself.

             (g) sets the privelege level for the Message and File
        areas in this system file. The default is DISGRACE. (This is
        not copied from the previous one; it is always set to
        DISGRACE.) To change it, enter as shown. The privelege
        levels are:

             TWIT
             DISGRACE
             NORMAL
             PRIVEL

        S_y_s_o_p_ O_n_l_y_ C_o_m_m_a_n_d_s_

             EXTRA
             SYSOP

             You must spell fully the privelege level name.

             Each system file has an attribute word. Currently, only
        one bit of it is used, so the method of changing it is
        crude. The 1 bit determines whether the MSG Path is a
        regular Message area or a FidoNet Mail area.

             1 0\A          Set normal Message Area
             1 1\A          Set Fidonet Area

             This should be set on only one MSG Path; the one you
        use for Fidonet mail. 

             Any changes you make are not permanent until you save
        them with (i). If you make changes, then select another area
        with (a), then the changes are lost.


        3_ -_-_ C_o_m_m_a_n_d_ P_r_i_v_e_l_e_g_e_ L_e_v_e_l_s_

        # -- READ COMMAND ONLY

             The 3 command is used to change and list the privelege
        levels for each command in each Section. 3 by itself lists
        the command names and the privelege level needed to be able
        to use it. If the users privelege level isn't high enough,
        then the command will not show in the prompt.

             To change a privelege level, you enter:

             3 <cmd> <privelege>

             Where <cmd> is the command letter as normally entered
        (for instance, in a Message Section, K for Kill message,
        etc) and <privelege> is the name of the privelege level, as
        listed under the 1 command. The change is stored
        immediately.

             The following are considered separate areas, as far as
        the 3 command goes:

                Main Section,           MAINPRIV.BBS
                Message Sections,       MSGPRIV.BBS
                Mail Sections,          MAILPRIV.BBS
                File Sections,          FILEPRIV.BBS
                Read Command Prompt     READPRIV.BBS
                CHANGE Command Prompt   CHGPRIV.BBS

             Though FidoNet message sections are almost identical to
        regular Message Sections, it has it's own set of privelege
        levels for the commands.

        4_ -_-_ F_i_d_o_n_e_t_ P_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r_s_

             The 4 command sets and displays FidoNet parameters.
        These parameters are used mainly by FidoNet.

             1 <number>\N        Set Node Number
             1 <pathname>\P      Set Mail Path
             1 <pathname>\F      Set Mail File Path

             The Mail Path is the message directory you want to use
        for the FidoNet mail area. It must be the same as one of the
        message paths set with the 1 command, and the one that has
        the MAIL attribute set with "1 1\A".

             The Mail File Path is where files received via FidoNet
        are placed. Generally a good place is the same as where ou
        put uploaded files, or a seperate directory only for mail
        files.

             The node number is the way that your Fido system is
        identified to others on the Net. These numbers must be
        unique, and known to everyone else in the Net. If you bought
        the Fido package, then your node number is on the cover of
        the FidoNet manual. Otherwise, contact Tom Jennings at Fido
        #1 to get one.

        5_ -_-_ L_i_s_t_ s_c_h_e_d_u_l_e_d_ e_v_e_n_t_s_

             Lists all of the scheduled events that Fido can
        execute. Events are added, changed, enabled, disabled, etc
        with the 6 and 7 commands. The default, with a new Fido
        version 9, is one event enabling the Yell command.

             The actual scheduler operation is covered in the
        Scheduler section of F_i_d_o_'_s_ F_i_d_o_N_e_t_ M_a_n_u_a_l_. Basically, these
        events are things like when to execute FidoNet, days and
        times when the Yell command is allowed, and with additional
        work, when external programs are to be executed.

        6_ -_-_ E_n_t_e_r_/_c_h_a_n_g_e_ e_v_e_n_t_s_

             This command allows entering and changing events. There
        is room for up to 35 events. You are asked for an event
        number, then you are asked for each of the components that
        make up an event. These are:

        Event # [0 - 35]:

             Which event to work on. Events can be in any order;
        Fido executes them according to the day and time. If you
        enter a number that is already used, you will replace it
        with the new one you are entering. Hitting RETURN will exit
        the 6 command.

        Day of week [All, 0=Sun, 1=Mon ...]:

             The day of the week that this event should be run on.







        Fido's Operating Manual T. Jennings 1 Nov 84            Page 59
        S_y_s_o_p_ O_n_l_y_ C_o_m_m_a_n_d_s_

        Entering A (for ALL) means run it every day. For example,
        FidoNet gets run every day; enter A. An alternative (just
        for an example) would be to enter seven events, one for each
        day of the week. This is just for convenience.

        Start Time: [hh:mm]:

             The time this event is to start. Enter as 10:44, etc,
        or use a space instead of the colon. Entering just 10, for
        instance, is the same as entering 10:00. 00:00 (or just 0)
        is midnight; 23:59 is one minute til midnight.

        Window width, Minutes:

             How long the specified event should be run. This can be
        from 1 to 1440, the number of minutes in a day. If you had
        entered A for the day of the week, 10:00 for the start time,
        and 60 for window width, then the event would be run from
        10:00AM to 11:00AM.

             For external events, you should enter one minute; Fido
        cannot "call back" an external program when it's time is
        over, it is up to that program (and your batch file) to
        return to Fido. 

        Schedule Tag [A - W, X, Y, Z]:

             This tells Fido what event it is you are running. A - W
        are FidoNet events; F_i_d_o_'_s_ F_i_d_o_N_e_t_ M_a_n_u_a_l_ describes this in
        detail. Tag A is the normal, nation wide FidoNet time slot.
        If in doubt, or for new systems, enter A. This will then be
        compatible with older FidoNets.

             Y is the yell command. The Yell command (which rings
        the bell annoyingly on the console) can be enabled for any
        time of the day, by setting it up as an "event". Fido will
        not terminate or do anything different; it will just allow
        the yell command to be used while the event is running. The
        default is to allow the yell command from 10:00AM til
        10:00PM.

             Tag X and tag Z are external events; with these, you
        can run other DOS programs through a specially modified
        batch file. X terminates with DTR low (the modem hung up,
        and auto-answer disabled) and Z leaves the modem connected,
        so that you can run programs that "talk" to the modem.

        ERRORLEVEL [4 - 255]:

             Asked ONLY if Tag X or Z is entered, above. This is the
        ERRORLEVEL code passed back to DOS, where it can be detected
        by the batch file, for selectively running programs.

             This is used to enable, disable and remove set events.

        You are asked for an event number (as entered above) and
        then what to do with it. If you enter an event number that
        does not exist, it will tell you so.

             Enable "turns on" that event, that is, allows it to
        run. Disable causes it to be ignored, though it will still
        exist, so you can enable it later if you want. Remove
        deletes it entirely.


        8_ -_-_ R_e_n_u_m_b_e_r_ M_e_s_s_a_g_e_s_

                The 8 command performs the same function as the
        RENUM.EXE utility program, but from within Fido. This will
        renumber all the messages in the current message area, so
        that they start at 1, and increase by 1. It will preserve
        Replies and See Alsos.

                It has the limitation that it will not renumber if
        there are more than 200 messages; either Kill some messages,
        or use RENUM.EXE, which will handle up to 1000 messages per
        area.

                Renumbering causes temporary great upheaval to the
        messages themselves; interrupting the 8 command (by powering
        off or resetting) is not reccomended. To prevent losing the
        connection (and disconnecting) from aborting the renum,
        nothing is displayed while the command is working.


        0_ -_-_ T_e_r_m_i_n_a_t_e_ t_o_ D_O_S_

                This is a highly specialized command, that works
        only when a /W value is specified on the command line.

                When set, it causes a immediate termination to DOS
        with the ERRORLEVEL specified by the /W switch. It is
        assumed that your RUNBBS batch file will trap this
        errorlevel, and do something appropriate.

                Note that it is NOT adequate to just use CTTY to
        redirect the console; you must have a special "watchdog"
        program to monitor the Carrier Detect line from the modem,
        and reboot the system if carrier is lost. Ohterwise, is the
        connection is lost, the next person that calls in has
        control of your system, from the DOS level.

             There are a number of commands that can be used from 
        the system's local console while a user is on. This is
        sometimes called "spy mode", as the user does not have any
        indication that you are spying on them. The commands are:


             ?
                  Displays the name of the current user, and how
        long he has been on. It lists a small menu of other things
        that can be done, described here.

             C
                 Chat with the caller. (Also see the Yell command.)
        The user will get an appropriate message, and you will then
        be in terminal mode with the caller, allowing you to type
        back and forth. The chat mode is terminated by typing
        Control-Z, at which point the user is back in normal Fido
        operation.

             Z
                  Clear the current users limits. This clears the 
        accumulated download, time on system, and accumulated time 
        on system. (same as user calling back in 48 hours.) This is
        useful for extending someones time limits temporarily.

             ^A (Control-A)

             Simultaneous keyboards. All keystrokes typed are
        treated as if they were from the callers modem. Terminated
        by ^Z, Control-Z, below. This can be used for intensive
        handholding of terrified users.

             ^Z (Control-Z)

             Terminates both Chat mode (or the Yell command) and

                ^X (Control-X)

                Immediately terminate a call. The user is logged
        off. Ignored during file transfers. To be used sparingly. If
        you need to get into the system while a caller is on, refer
        to ^T.

                ^O (Control-O)
                ^N (Control-N)

                These two are for special purposes only. They turn
        off (^O) and on (^N) the local screen output. Normally, Fido
        displays what the user sees, on the local screen.

                For use with a multi-DOS type program (XAP,
        Multilink, etc) this console activity greatly slows down the
        system. It can be disabled with ^O, or via the /I command
        line switch. These two keys override and /I command line

                ^T (Control-T)

                When entered while a user is on, after the user
        hangs up it causes Fido to disable the modem, and alert the
        operator that the system is free. Fido rings the bell once a
        second for five minutes.

                The sysop types ^C to quit to DOS, or ^Z to stop the
        terminate and resume normal operation. If there is no
        response in five minutes, then Fido resumes normal operation
        automatically.

             When a user has started a Yell, hitting the space bar
        immediately causes the "sysop not available" message.

             The scheduler can be used to limit the hours in which
        the Yell command can be used.

             A questionaire is a pseudo-language file that is
        interpreted by Fido. If someone invokes the A (Answer
        Questionaire) command in the Main Section, and there is no
        questionaire, it says:

           "No questionaire today"

             Questionaires are simple text files that are
        interpreted by Fido. There is a very simple line oriented
        pseudo language that interprets these scripts. There are
        only a couple of "commands", and only two crude
        conditionals.

             The answers to the questionaire are put in a seperate 
        file, without the questions. They are also normal ASCII
        text, but in a fixed field format with field characters, to
        make post- processing of the questionaire easier. (Some day
        I'll actually write the processor!)

             The questionaire consists of two files:

        QUESTION.BBS    The questionaire script
        ANSWERS.BBS     The answers

             Answers are appended to the end of the answer file; it
        is create first if it does not exist.

             There is also a second questionaire: QNOPWD.BBS. If
        this  exists, users who forgot their password, or if the /M
        (private system) is specified, they get to fill it in. You
        can put in requests for passwords, address and phone
        numbers, etc here.

             The first character of each line tells Fido what to do 
        with the line. This first character is a normal printable 
        character. If the first character is not one of the known 
        commands, the line is merely displayed.

             NOTE: Do not have blank lines in the questionaire. 
        Interrogation will stop at end of file or a blank line.

             The questionaire commands are:

        /<prompt string>
             Display <prompt string>, then input a single line of 
        text. Maximum line length is 78 characters. The usual
        editing is available. The inputted text is written to the
        answer file.

        * 
             Put users info to the answer file: name and last 
        (current) signon time and date. Useful for the "what kind of 
        system ..." type questionaires. Leaving this out allows 
        confidential questionaires, as there is no other record of
        which caller filled on in.

        Q_u_e_s_t_i_o_n_a_i_r_e_s_


        +N <prompt string>
             Multiple choice. The single digit number N is the
        number of possible choices. (1 - 9) If an illegal number or
        the number is missing, the number of choices defaults to
        one, so at least it wont hang up. The choice entered by the
        user is checked for in range 1 to N, and saved in the answer
        file.

             There is a special feature of multiple choice: an 
        internal flag is set if the last choice (choice N) is
        selected, that can be tested by the ? and ! commands, below.

        ? <prompt string>
             To be used ONLY immediately after a multiple choice 
        question. This command will be executed only if choice N is
        made. This allows implementing "A, B, C, Other" type
        questions. Put "other" as the last choice; if selected, then
        the ? command following it will be executed. See the example
        below. If any other selection was made, this line will be
        skipped.

             The conditional flag is cleared by:  + command, ? 
        command, _ command. No other commands affect it.

        !
             To be used ONLY after a multiple choice question,
        similar to ? above. If the last choice of a multiple choice
        was selected, this terminates the questionaire. Allows
        asking "Do you want to fill this out (1) yes (2) no".
        _
             (Underscore) Unconditionally clear the conditional
        flag.

           The answer file is a specially formatted text file. It 
        can (has to be for now) interpreted manually. (The answer
        file for QNOPWD.BBS is ANOPWD.BBS) For the questionaire
        above, here's what the answer might look like: (manual
        comments in parens)

             The SYSOP utility is used to maintain the user list
        file, USER.BBS. It is a simple data base type program, has
        online help, and is fairly easy to use.

             First, a general description of the user list. The user
        list is a variable number of records, with one record per
        user end to end. New users get added to the end. SYSOP
        allows going back and forth through the user list, changing
        things such as names, passwords, privelege levels, and more
        global things like purging old users from the list.

             It will be much easier to use this section while
        actually running the SYSOP program. When first run, SYSOP
        displays the first record in the list, usually the sysop.
        You can get a brief description of each of the commands by
        entering a ?, then the command key listed in the menu.

             SYSOP automatically saves any changes you make. To
        change a password, for instance, use the P command (below)
        and thats it. SYSOP will save any changes before exiting to
        DOS or selecting another user record.

        S_e_l_e_c_t_i_n_g_ a_ U_s_e_r_ R_e_c_o_r_d_

             There are a number of ways to look at (and maybe
        change) user records. You can use the following key to move
        to the next and previous record:

             N_e_x_t_ H_i_g_h_e_s_t_       P_r_e_v_i_o_u_s_
               >                   <
               +                   -
               .                   ,
               _                   =

             The last four don't appear to make any sense, but they
        happen to share the same keytop, either shifted or
        unshifted.

             B takes you directly to the first record.

        Z_ -_-_ E_n_d_ o_f_ t_h_e_ U_s_e_r_s_ L_i_s_t_

             Z takes you to the end of the list.

        A_ -_-_ S_e_l_e_c_t_ R_e_c_o_r_d_ N_u_m_b_e_r_

             You can also enter the record number directly with the
        A command. This is handy only if you know the record number.

        F_ -_-_ F_i_n_d_ a_ R_e_c_o_r_d_

             This works similar to the I command in Fido. You are
        prompted for a string; SYSOP then searches for that string







        Fido's Operating Manual T. Jennings 1 Nov 84            Page 67
        T_h_e_ S_Y_S_O_P_ U_t_i_l_i_t_y_

        in the name portion of the user records, and stops at the
        first one it finds.

             It starts searching from the n_e_x_t_ record; i.e. if you
        are currently at #100, it starts looking at #101. When it
        reaches the end, it wraps around, and continues from record
        #1. It stops if a match is found, or until it reaches the
        point where it started. Therefore, if no match is found, it
        leaves you where you were.

             If you are searching for "John", you will probably get
        more than one match. If it matches one you did not want,
        then just repeat it; it will start searching again with the
        n_e_x_t_ record. For speed, you can use the Control-R key as in
        Fido, to recover the text you had entered ("John" in this
        example, by typing:

             F         Find command
             ^R        Restore old line
             CR        Execute command

        E_ -_-_ E_n_t_e_r_ N_e_w_ U_s_e_r_

             E adds a new user to the list. First, it goes to the
        end of the list (may take a while) then makes a clear, empty
        user record. You use the usual SYSOP commands (below) to
        fill out the record.

             After doing an E, SYSOP will save the new user record
        only if you change at least one field in it. If you just do
        an E, then a command such as B or - it will not save the new
        record. Once you have changed anything (name, password, etc)
        it will save it automatically.

        N_ -_-_ N_a_m_e_

             N prompts you for a new name. You can enter one or two
        words. Entering a blank line leaves the present name.

        P_ -_-_ P_a_s_s_w_o_r_d_

             Enter a new password.

        V_ -_-_ P_r_i_v_e_l_e_g_e_ L_e_v_e_l_

             Change users privelege level. You can enter only the
        first letter of the privelege level name, or enter the whole
        thing. The levels are listed by ?V. They are:

             TWIT
             DISGRACE
             NORMAL
             PRIVEL

             This is used to mark old users that haven't called in
        for a long time, to be later purged from the list. (One time
        callers, etc) The user records are not deleted by this
        command; you must use the ! command to do it after you have
        them all marked.

             It starts at the current record, and if a caller hasnt
        called within the specified number of days, that record is
        marked as "deleted". Users within the number of days are
        marked as "Un-deleted". You can use this if you change your
        mind, for instance, to un-delete everyone use the O command
        to mark all users that havent called in, say, 1000 days.
        This will undelete anyone that has called in within 1000
        days.

             A good number to use is 32; you will find that almost
        all users that get deleted have called only once. SYSOP
        displays each user record that it is marking.

             This marks the current record as deleted, as if it were
        marked by O.

             This does the actual deletion from the user list of any
        marked records. First, it makes a backup copy of USER.BBS in
        USER.BAK. As it deletes records, it puts the deleted ones
        into USER.OLD, where they can be recovered from if a mistake
        is made. 

             You can recover deleted records by either renaming
        USER.BAK to USER.BBS, or by appending USER.OLD to USER.BBS
        by the DOS command:

             REN USER.BBS USER.WRK    rename for now,
             COPY/B USER.WRK+USER.OLD USER.BBS

             Note that SYSOP will n_o_t_ delete users that have a
        privelege of EXTRA or above or any credit left.

             This is used for supplying users with credit for
        sending FidoNet mail. It prompts you for a dollar value,
        which is the a_d_d_e_d_ to the current credit, after subtracting
        any debit from it. If there were already $5.16 credit left,
        entering "10" would leave them with $15.16 credit.

             To set the credit to a specific number, enter:

             Fido saves the message area that a user was in last.
        Normally, new users end up in message area #1. For certain
        types of systems, you might want to eliminate the A (Area-
        Change) command, and lock users into particular areas. This
        determines what area the user will end up in when entering
        the Message Section.

             Note that if the specified area does not exist, or it's
        privelege level is too high, Fido will automatically bump
        them into area #1. Make sure you have these set up right.

             Some of SYSOPs commands may take a while, such as

                Fido keeps a record of all callers in a simple log
        that records the number of callers per hour, for every day,
        for seven days. When it is seven days old, it gets renamed
        to the current date, and a new one is started.

                The TIMELOG.BBS file contains 168 slots: one for
        each hour of the day, for seven days, plus the date when
        started and ended, etc. Every time someone calls in and logs
        in succesfully, (enter their name, and guess their password)
        Fido increments the appropriate slot. When all seven days
        are used, it renames it to the current date (TIMELOG.BBS
        becomes for instance, 01JUL84.TLG, or 21MAY84.TLG, etc) and
        starts a new TIMELOG.BBS.

                These .TLG files are fairly small; 378 bytes each,
        so you dont have to worry about them filling your disk for
        quite a few months.

                Note that TIMELOG.BBS is not started on Sunday; it
        starts whenever you first run Fido. If you want to
        synchronize it to start on a particular day, delete
        TIMELOG.BBS on that day of the week, and when Fido is run,
        it will create a new one.

                TIMELOG.EXE will run on any MSDOS machine, and is
        not hardware sensitive. To run it, enter:

                TIMELOG <name>

                Where <name> is the name of a .TLG file. It will
        display the contents as crude bar graphs. There are two
        options:

                TIMELOG <name> /P       Pause
                TIMELOG <name> /F       Format

                /P tells TIMELOG to pause between each graph (so
        they dont run off the screen). /F formats the output for a
        printer, putting formfeeds in between each graph. (To send
        to the printer, use redirection: TIMELOG <name> /F >PRN)

                FidoNet is a true electronic mail network, not to be
        confused with other systems that use the word "net" because
        it sounds trendy.

                FidoNet links all of the 100 or so Fidos across the
        country, all together once a night (or more), to accomodate
        automatic message and file transfers. 

                Simply put, you enter a message on one system, say
        in San Francisco, and Fidonet later sends that message to
        the right Fido, which may be in Boston. All of this is
        totally automatic. 


                From the users point of view, FidoNet is just
        another message area. All of the magic is hidden away. As a
        sysop, you should make an effort to understand it, as it
        will make it a lot easier to install and use.

                The most important point in the original FidoNet
        design was l_o_w_ c_o_s_t_. Since most Fidos are run privately,
        having it send *.EXE to every Fido in the country is not too
        desireable. Therefore, Fido has complete cost control at
        every step; FidoNet need not cost you anything to operate.
        You get to control absolutely everything that FidoNet does.

                In some areas of the country, there are enough Fidos
        that they can benefit by having a host system. A host takes
        care of receiving mail from across the country, and passing
        it along later to the local systems. Some also have outgoing
        hosts; mail destined for far away places gets sent to your
        host (usually a local call) who then passes it on to where
        ever its going.

                Fido keeps logs and "accounts" with each user, and
        each host and node system. These are used to control costs
        (a user with no credit cannot send mail) and to make it
        easier to pay a host for passing you mail across the
        country. 























        Fido's Operating Manual T. Jennings 1 Nov 84            Page 72

             Each node maintains a node list, that contains the
        accessible remote systems. Systems not in the list cannot be
        mailed to. The sysop controls this file, updating or
        changing it with any text editor. It can only be read from
        within Fido; users cannot otherwise access it, and cannot
        see the actual phone numbers used to dial.

             If your Fido is a public "free" one, then probably no
        toll call systems will be allowed for general use. All users
        credits default to zero, so that users cannot send mail
        willy nilly. In order for a user to enter a mail message (to
        a toll call system) the sysop has to assign them credit with
        the SYSOP.EXE utility program.

                Some local areas have a host that will accept toll
        call mail for free; contact the Fidos in your area to find
        out about this.

             If a system in the node list is marked as free, then
        anyone may send messages to it.

             Each user record contains a credit and a debit.
        Messages entered are charged to debit, and cannot exceed the
        credit. Deleteing a message (that has not been sent yet)
        entered lowers the debit by the cost of the message; the
        actual cost of the message is stored within the message.
        Onec a message is sent, the cost cannot be recovered by
        deleteing it.

             Assuming you already have Fido running, setting up
        FidoNet is simple. If you dont have Fido running, then skip
        this part until you do.

             The basic steps to do are:

        (1)  Set the basic mail parameters shared by Fido and 
             FidoNet.

        (2)  Set up the MAIL message and file area.

        (3)  Make up a working node list (list of other systems.)

        (4)  Set the scheduler to run FidoNet.

        (5)  If you have a host system, make a route list.

        (6)  Obtain a node number.

             That is all there is to it. Each step is described
        below. Also, I can't emphasize how important it is to ...

             HAVE THE TIME AND DATE SET ACCURATELY!!!!!!!!

             Fidonet depends heavily on the correct time and date.
        Within 5 minutes or so is fine, its not that critical, but
        since this is a time driven system, it is very important.


             First, create the message area that you want to use for
        mail, or use an existing one. Pick any name or place you
        want. This is identical to making a regular message area;
        see the step by step installation section for details. Set
        the SYSTEMn.BBS system file, the DIR.BBS descriptions, etc
        as described there.

                Also, create a file area for files received from the
        net. This can be your upload area, or a unique mail file
        only area. It does not need to be a public area, accessible
        by the File Seciotn commands, though it can be.

             Now, you have to tell Fido that this is a mail area,
        instead of an ordinary message area. This is done with the 1
        command.

             1 <number>     Select your mail area,
             1 1\A          Set MAIL attribute
             1 S            Save the changes

             Now Fido knows that this area is a mail area; the
        extended features that support Fidonet operation are now
        enabled when in that area.

             Next, you have to set MAIL.SYS, the file used by both
        Fido and FidoNet. It tells Fido what your node number is,
        and tells FidoNet where the mail message area is. (This is a
        bit redundant, but this file is used to connect Fido and
        FidoNet together.)

             Using the 4 command (See F_i_d_o_'_s_ I_n_s_t_a_l_l_a_t_i_o_n_ M_a_n_u_a_l_ for
        details) set the mail path to be the same as the message
        path you set for mail use above:

             4 <pathname>\P      Set MAIL Path

             This is the path that Fidonet uses to get and put
        messages.

             4 <pathname>\F      Set Mail Files Path

             this is where any files received are to go. It should
        NOT be your default Fido area, as you might get files of the
        same name, wrecking ones you have. Best to make it a
        seperate, new area, or use an upload area.

                If you have a node number, set it now. If you do
        not, PLEASE DONT set a fake number. You do not need a number
        to send mail.

             4 <number>\N        Set Node Number

        TO OBTAIN A NODE NUMBER:

                Enter a Mail message, and send it to Fido #51 via
        FidoNet. This way, they will know that you are really up and
        running. Remember to include:

                Systems name,
                Sysops name,
                Phone number,
                Hours of operation,
                City and state,
                Any other important details.

             First, a small glossary of terms used in this manual to
        describe FidoNet and all it's permutations.

        Network: A group of two or more Fidos, that send mail
        to/from each other at a specified time.

        Node:     One Fido, running FidoNet. It may be a host as
        well.

        Host:     A node that handles mail for itself as well as
        other nodes. It may accept mail, and send it on to another
        node. 

        Local Net:     A group of nodes, presumably within a small
        geographical area, (ie. non-toll call or cheap calls) that
        consists one or more nodes and a host. Basically, a small,
        self contained Network.

        Local Node: Really the same as just "Node", but implies that
        it is a node that has a host serving it.

        Topography: Basically, if you were to draw a map showing all
        the nodes and their interconections. Some of the "shapes"
        made by the map are called "topographies" if they show some
        recognizable pattern, such as star, ring, etc.

        Traffic: The actual messages being sent. If you picture
        messages as things that travel along the phone connection,
        it makes more sense.

             Fido and FidoNet are both contained in one program, run
        as specified by the scheduler. Fidonet is a time driven
        system, and the national time slot is at 1:00 AM Pacific
        Time. (4:00 AM eastern Time) During normal Fido operation,
        users can enter messages, and during the FidoNet time, these
        messages are made into packets and sent to the right
        destination. The messages may be destined to any one or more
        of the available remote nodes in the nodelist.

             At the predetermined time, Fidonet takes control. It
        then (if enabled) creates mail packets, one per node,
        containing the messages for each node. If there is no mail
        to a node, no packet is created, and no call is made to that
        system.

             After the outgoing packets are made, FidoNet
        alternately waits for calls and attempts to place calls.
        Mail packet transfers are done on a collision detection
        basis. After the first few collisions, the network
        synchronizes. If there are a number of nodes to send mail
        to, each one is called in turn, until all are sent, or mail
        time is over. If it fails with one node, it goes on to the
        next, and repeats the failed one only after trying all of
        the others first. 

             In between outgoing calls (if any) FidoNet delays a
        random interval, during which it waits for incoming calls.
        This interval, along with the redial algorithm, synchronizes
        the net after the initial collisions.

             If an incoming call is detected, it attempts connection
        with it. The baud rate is determined (same as a normal
        caller would in Fido) and a message to human callers is
        displayed (warning them that it is accepting only other
        FidoNodes) and a synchronization process is started. This
        process must complete within 60 seconds, or the call is
        terminated. Once synchronized, the packet transfer is made.
        The receiver just stores that packet for later use, and then
        disconnects.

             Whenever an incoming call is received, FidoNet calls
        out immediately afterwards (assuming there are calls to be
        made) since there is a high probability that the line is now
        clear. This helps synchronize the network.

             To place an outgoing call, the sender dials the number,
        performs the sync process mentioned above, and transfers
        it's outgoing packet. (Messages to a given node are again
        checked against the node list at mail time; if they do not
        match, the packet is not sent, and an error is logged.) If
        there are any files to be sent, they are sent after hte
        packet. If the transfer was successful, the destination node
        number is deleted from the senders list of nodes to call. 

             The collision detect algorithm is optimized such that







        Fido's Operating Manual T. Jennings 1 Nov 84            Page 77
        F_i_d_o_N_e_t_ O_p_e_r_a_t_i_o_n_

        during the first few minutes of mail time, there are many
        collisions, after which the net synchronizes, and none or
        few collisions occur. 

             When mail time is over, FidoNet deletes all it's
        outgoing packets that were assembled, and for each one that
        was sent sucessfully, marks those messages (in the mail
        area) as SENT, so the originator can tell if they went out
        or not. Then, the incoming packets are unassembled, and the
        messages placed sequentially in the mail area. These packets
        are then deleted. Any files received are marked in the
        FILES.BBS file list in the mail file area.

             If any mail at all was sent, the user credits are
        balanced. This is somewhat unsatisfactory, as it balances
        the accounts even if the mail was not sent. This is to
        prevent extremely long processing time necessary to account
        for each message and user. (Users lists run upwards of 600
        entries typically; on a floppy based system this would
        become unworkable.)

             Fidonet then terminates, and if there were no fatal
        errors invokes Fido for another day. Messages received are
        then accessible like any other message.







































        Fido's Operating Manual T. Jennings 1 Nov 84            Page 78

             The scheduler is the way that Fido controls when, as
        opposed to how, FidoNet (and other things) are run. The
        details of operating the scheduler commands is described in
        the Sysop Only Commands section. This section tells how to
        use the events.

             The scheduler contains a list of "events", each of
        which consists of a day and time and other information on
        what to do at that time. While Fido is waiting for a caller,
        it is also watching the scheduler.

             When Fido accepts a caller, it watches the time until
        the next scheduled event; if it is less than that callers
        time limit, it sets their limit to be the time until the
        event, and warns the user that they have less time than
        normal. Fido will enforce this limit to ensure that the
        caller logs off so that the event can be run.

             The scheduler keeps information on what is to be done
        to execute the event. The schedule Tag is what determines
        what kind of event it might be.

             Tags A to W are reserved as FidoNet schedules; when an
        event tag A to W is found, FidoNet is run. This tag controls
        which nodes in the list mail is sent to; this allows sending
        mail to certain other systems during certain times, by
        setting a schedule with each desired tag.



             This example covers making Fido run FidoNet in the
        national time slot. The time of day depends on your
        location, that is your time zone. The example below assumes
        Pacific Time; adjust accordingly.

             Pacific Time        Central Time        Eastern Time
               01:00 AM            03:00 AM            04:00 AM
               60 minutes          60 minutes          60 minutes


                Do two things: Set Fido to run FidoNet every day at
        1:00AM for one hour (normal FidoNet operation) and allow the
        Yell command to be used only between the hours of 9:00AM and
        5:00PM. 

        (Enter command '6')
        Event # [0 - 34]: 0             (over write the default one)
        Day of week [All, 0=Sun ...]: A (every day)
        Start Time [hh:mm]: 9           (9AM)
        Window Width: 480               (8 hrs)
        Schedule Tag: [A - W, X, Y, Z] Y (Yell command)
        (Yell command now enabled from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM)

        (Enter command '6')
        Event # [0 - 34]: 1             (New event)

        Schedule Tag [A - W, X, Y, Z]: A (Normal FidoNet)

             That is it. It was not necessary to choose events 0 and
        1; any two could have been used. Using 0, however, replaced
        the default yell command enable (10:00 AM til 10:00 PM) with
        the desired one.

             To add other events, just choose another event number
        and enter them as above. There is room for up to 35 events.

                The scheduler can be used to cause Fido to terminate
        to DOS (to the RUNBBS.BAT batch file, actually) with an
        ERRORLEVEL value that can be used to run programs at certain
        times of the day.

                This isnt a general purpose way to run programs like
        data based programs, etc. It is meant for use with programs
        that can run unattended, such as Fido's RENUM.EXE utility
        program.

                You set a schedule normally, except select X for the
        tag. When you do this, it asks an additional question:

        ERRORLEVEL [4 - 255]:

                This is the ERRORLEVEL passed back to DOS. This
        value can be tested for in the batch file by:

                IF ERRORLEVEL (xx) GOTO LABEL

                Where (xx) is the errorlevel you specify, and LABEL
        is a label in the batch file.

                You need to understand how MSDOS batch files work;
        it is too complex a subject to cover here. One reminder
        though: the IF ERRORLEVEL (xx) GOTO LABEL does not mean "if
        errorlevel EQUALS (xx) goto label", it means "if errorlevel
        IS EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN (xx) goto label". This means
        that you must put the tests in decreasing order:

                FIDO_XXX switches ...
                if errorlevel 10 goto x1
                if errorlevel 4 goto x2
                if errorlevel 1 goto end

                Routing is used when it is necessary to send mail
        for one system to another one. The system which mail is
        diverted to is called a host, and usually mail for a number
        of systems is sent to a single host.

                Routing is very useful when there are a number of
        Fidos in a given area; if you had a message to each of four
        systems in a single city, say, St. Louis, without routing it
        would mean four seperate phone calls. With routing, FidoNet
        sends all the messages in a single packet, in one call. The
        host worries about unpacking the messages and sending them
        along.

                The phone company bills by the minute. At 1200 baud,
        Fidonet sends about 6000 to 7000 characters a minute; most
        messages are about 500 bytes. So, to send a 500 byte
        message, you are paying the full minute; the rest of the
        minute is wasted. Since hosts send many messages at once,
        the call takes longer, but is doubly cheaper, as usually all
        the messages fit into one, or possibly two minutes, whereas
        if each system called directly, each call would be one
        minute.

                Of course, you either have to find a rich, generous
        host, or use the host account feature and pool your
        resources. (Later on that.)

             All this is accomplished by the router and the
        scheduler. The scheduler controls when to run FidoNet (ie.
        when to send and receive mail) and the router controls where
        to send the mail.

             As an example, here is a very simple system, consisting
        of four nodes, two of which are acting as hosts.

                     (Host)                     (Host)
                     Fido 1 ------------------- Fido 3
                       |                          |
                       |                          |
                     Fido 2                     Fido 4

                The idea is to make Fido 2 send all its mail for
        Fidos 3 and 4 to Fido 1 instead. (In real life, there are
        usually many other Fidos doing the same thing.) Instead of
        all systems calling each other all at once, it concentrates
        many messages into a very few calls. 

                The route list tells Fido how to send the mail. If
        there is no route list, then the mail goes out the simple
        way, ie. directly.

                The route list is a list of alternatives. For
        instance:

        ROUTE-TO 1







        Fido's Operating Manual T. Jennings 1 Nov 84            Page 81
        R_o_u_t_i_n_g_:_ M_e_s_s_a_g_e_ F_o_r_w_a_r_d_i_n_g_

                3,4

                Says to route to Fido #1, mail for Fidos 3 and 4.
        (This by the way is the exact syntax for the route list,
        ROUTE.BBS.)


                Fido #1 in the example above needs to send this mail
        onward to Fido 3. If you are observant (or paranoid) you may
        wonder what prevents Fido #1 from forwarding ALL mail sent
        to it, as when another Fido (not shown here) accidentally
        (or on purpose ...) sends its mail to #1, hoping it will
        make the long distance calls ...

                Unless explicitly stated, no Fido will forward mail
        NOT ENTERED DIRECTLY ON IT. This prevents the above from
        happening. There are two route list commands used to specify
        that it is OK to forward mail from some nodes, to certain
        others:

        FORWARD-TO 3

        ACCEPT-FROM 2

                This tells Fido #1 (when in 1's route list) that it
        is OK to send mail from other systems onward to Fido 3. It
        also says it is OK to accept mail from Fido #2. 

                To sum this up, Fido #1 will send its own mail to
        Fido #3 (obiously) and will also accept mail from #2, and
        pass it on to #3. It wont allow #2 to send mail to say,
        #100, or any other not specified.



                The last leg of the journey for a message, #3 to #4,
        may be different. Usually, its not a toll call from a host
        to a local. Its generally OK for a host to allow forwarding
        ALL mail to a local, since it doesnt cost anthing. (Besides,
        this is the function of a host ...) #3's route list must
        look like:

        ACCEPT-FROM 1,2
        FORWARD-TO 4

                From this example, you can figure out what it would
        look like in real life. For example, the ACCEPT-FROM for a
        host (such as #3) would have to contain all nodes in the
        system, since the host takes in mail from the outside world,
        and passes it to its locals.

        S_c_h_e_d_u_l_i_n_g_


                Of course, something was left out in the above
        example ... you may have noticed that a message has to go
        through three mailings to get to its destination. This
        requires that FidoNet be run three times, and Fidonet gets
        run only once?

                For local host systems, FidoNet is actually run
        three times per night; the standard one hour national time,
        and a shorter one before and after it. During the before and
        after schedules messages travel between hosts and locals; in
        the national time they travel from host to host. (Or host to
        system, or system to host, etc, for all the host nonhost
        combinations.)

                This is done with the scheduler, the sysop only 5,
        6, and 7 commands.

                Each time slot (called a schedule here) is unique.
        The schedule tag is a one character "name" for each time
        slot. The national window is schedule A, and runs from 1:00
        AM (PST) til 2:00 AM. The two before and after schedules can
        be anything but A: for instance, B and C. Here is a non
        existent example:

        Schedule B:     00:30 AM -> 00:59 AM local to host
        Schedule A:     01:00 AM -> 02:00 AM national
        Schedule C:     02:30 AM -> 03:00 AM local to host


                In the example above, we want to have Fido 1 serve
        the locals (and vice versa) during B and C, and not any of
        the national ones, since its outside the national time. All
        of them run A, the national time, so that they will get mail
        from systems that dont know about routing, and because its
        simpler anyways.

                This information goes into the route list too.

        SCHEDULE B 2
        SCHEDULE C 2

                It is not necessary to specify schedule A; by
        default, all systems are A unless specified otherwise.

                The previous examples covered all of what the route
        list does; here it is again, in a reference type format:

                ROUTE.BBS, the routing list for Fido, is a plain old
        text file, which you can create with almost any editor. It
        is very forgiving on it's format; it lets you use upper or
        lower case, blank lines, tabs, spaces, comments, etc.

                There are four KEYWORDS. Keywords are followed by
        lists of numbers, seperated by spaces, commas, tabs, or
        blank lines. For instance, the following are all OK:

        ROUTE-TO 10 22 51 16 17 4 65
        Route-To 10
                22,16,17,4,65
        route-TO 10
        22
        16
        17
        4
        65
        ROUTE-TO 10     22, 51, 16, 17, 4, 65

                Take your pick as to which you prefer.


        ROUTE-TO (host) n1, n2, n3, n4 ... nn

                Send all mail for n1 ... nn to (host) instead. This
        is the basic routing information. This just specifies how
        mail may be sent; ACCEPT-FROM and FORWARD-TO, below, control
        IF it will be sent.

                If you are not a host, then this is all you need to
        have in your route list.


        ACCEPT-FROM n1, n2, n3, n4, ... nn

                Accept mail from nodes n1 ... nn for further
        mailing. If you were an outgoing host, you should have all
        of your local nodes listed here; this means that you will
        accept mail from them, for further forwarding. See FORWARD-
        TO, below also. Mail from Fidos not in this list will not be
        accepted for forwarding.

                This applies only to hosts; it has no effect on
        messages entered on your system.


        FORWARD-TO n1, n2, n3, n4 ... nn

                Your system is allowed to forward only to the nodes
        specified here. This says it is OK to send mail onward to
        these nodes, ie. if you were a host, that mail for your

        local nodes (n1 ... nn) should be forwarded.

                If you are not a host, then you do not need to have
        this.


        SCHEDULE (tag) n1, n2, n3, n4 ... nn

                Send mail to nodes n1 ... nn during the specified
        schedule. This is needed only if you are a host or a local
        to a host. If not specified, all nodes are assumed to be tag
        A.

             The node list is the list of remote systems, the phone
        numbers, etc. When you apply for a permanent node number,
        you will receive the latest node list. Node lists will be
        broadcast to all FidoNodes as it is updated.

             NOTE: A slight oversight on my part: you must have your
        own node in the node list. Otherwise, you cannot leave a
        regular message in the mail section! Fidonet knows better
        than to try to call your own system. Messages that are To:
        the node it was entered on do not get mailed.

             The node list, called NODELIST.BBS, describes each
        remote system, one per line. You do not need to create one;
        new ones are distributed on a regular basis, and they are
        easy to find if you lose one.

             Each of these items are seperated by one or more spaces
        or tabs. Do NOT have spaces, commas or tabs in the middle of
        any of these.

        N_o_d_e_ N_u_m_b_e_r_

             This is that systems node number. This identifies the
        system mail is for (and from); it is buried in the mail
        packets, and if wrong, Fidonet will not accept that mail
        packet. It cannot be zero.

        C_o_s_t_

             This is the cost, in cents per message, that you want
        to charge a user for sending mail to this node. If the cost
        is 0, it is assumed to be a local call. If 0, then anyone
        may send messages to this node. Otherwise (if not zero) the
        user must have enough credit in their user record, or Fido
        will not allow them to enter mail. (Set by the SYSOP.EXE
        Utility program.)

        B_a_u_d_ R_a_t_e_

             This is the speed to dial this system with when it is
        time to send them mail. It is any number that is a multiple
        of 300; i.e. 300, 600, 1200 ... 9600. For dialing purposes,
        1200 and up are dialed at 1200 baud, everything else is

        dialed at 300. Set 300 if your modem cannot handle 1200.

        N_a_m_e_

             This is just the descriptive name (mnemonic) for this
        system. Luckily, most systems have some cutesy name, like
        Fido's Board, Demon, etc. It must be one word. (Use hyphens
        or underlines.) It must also be less than 14 characters long
        total.

        P_h_o_n_e_

             This is the phone number for the system. It is
        basically a standard D.C. Hayes SmartModem phone number,
        with one exception. If you use Sprint, etc, you must put it
        in each number. Do not leave spaces in the number. The legal
        characters in a phone number are:

             1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 # *
             -              ignored
             ( )            ignored
             .              1 second delay

             Note that comma is not the delay character; it is used
        to seperate items in lists. A dot is translated to a comma
        when dialing. In addition:

             T              Touch Tone
             P              Pulse

             May be inserted at any point in the number as needed.
        Fidonet dials in Touch Tone by default, if P is not
        specified. The maximum length of the phone number is 39
        characters.

        C_i_t_y_

             This is another single word field, usually the city and
        state.
