Fido/FidoNet version 10K errata sheet T. Jennings 9 July 85

	10K has very few changes over 10I. Mostly one bugç
fixed, a fairly obscure one: Fido would allow the entry of,ç
but would not transmit, a message destined to <region>/0. Itç
worked correctly for <net>/0.

	One addition, a command line switch:

	/Y		Disable path display

	By default, Fido will display the pathnames of theç
various message and file areas, plus the DIR.BBSç
descriptions. This supresses all path displays. The pathç
information is pretty much useless anyways.



Fido/FidoNet version 10I errata Sheet T. Jennings 10 May 85

	I apologize for the size of this errata sheet; timeç
constraints prevent me from creating a new manual. (Theç
usual excuse.)

	Most of the changes were bug fixes, and wont impactç
anything. The biggest change has been in the FidoNet networkç
system. There is an entire section here about the changes.

	If you are running a private-only network, theç
changes are no big deal. If you are running in the publicç
domain FidoNet, you should get a copy of:

	NODELIST.EXE

	Manages the nodelist for you; it will strip/add areaç
codes, dialing prefixes, adjust message costs, etc.,ç
eliminating all manual editing.

	ROUTEGEN.EXE

	Generates ROUTE files of any arbitrary complexityç
from an english language like script.

	These programs can be obtained from Fido #31 in Losç
Angeles.




	The quote file wont repeat itself over and over. Theç
position last used in the quote file is saved in SYSTEM.BBSç
(its size increases to 212 bytes) and used every time Fidoç
is run. The first time it will start at the beginning of theç
file.




	The Fido log file (SYSOP.LOG) has changed. The sameç
information is logged, only its appearance has changed. Thisç
should make the log smaller and easier to search withç
software. Extraneous words were removed, and the dataç
displayed in a more compact form. Each line starts with aç
specific character. (Most do, anyways.) The characters are:

	+ user name and time on
	! errors of all sorts
	= download and upload info
	- line between entries




	The /I command line switch now accepts a numericç
argument:

	<task>/I	Set multi-task environment

	This does only two simple things: it changes theç
names used for the log files, and affects the way messagesç
are created.

	The names for the logs will incorporate the task IDç
number; ie. if you specify 9/I the log files will be:

	SYSOP9.LOG
	MAILER9.LOG

	You cannot use 0 as a number. The other effect ofç
setting a task ID is to force Fido to recount the messagesç
before saving a new one. This hopefully prevents duplicateç
message numbers making a mess of things, or at leastç
minimizes it. It has the unfortunate side effect of greatlyç
slowing down saving messages.

	If you use /I in test mode, you will not be able toç
see anything. Do not use /I with /T.




	Four new modem types:

	9	Ventel MD212 with WECO option
	10	GDC modem
	11	DC Hayes Smartmodem 2400
	12	US Robotics Courier 2400

	The Hayes 2400 is a terrible modem. It will be OKç
for an autoanswer application, but very annoying for generalç
use.




	FidoNet messages have an audit trail: whenever aç
Fido passes a msg on further (ie. a host) it adds to theç
bottom the line:

"Via Fido net/node"

	Each Fido a given msg passes through will add itsç
own audit trail line.




	Alternate node ID (net/node) has been added; eachç
node potentially has two independent net and node numberç
pairs. The current one will apply like it does now; allç
messages will be marked with the regular net/node numbers.ç
The alternate is mainly for hosts, who are a node in aç
specific net, and node #0 as well. The normal case will beç
where both node and net numbers are the same. In the hostç
case, the numbers will be set like:

	Node    : nn
	Net     : mm
	Alt Node: 0
	Alt Net : mm

	This says that this system is node nn in net mm, andç
is also node 0, the host. It can also be used as:

	Node    : nn
	Net     : mm
	Alt Node: oo
	Alt Net : pp

	So that the node is in two different nets; mm/nn andç
pp/oo. 




	File attach capability has been given to EXTRAç
privilege users, instead of only SYSOPs. Be careful, itç
still allows access to the entire system, including *.*.




	No longer will FidoNet call millions of times forç
systems that dont answer. The maximum is now 20 tries perç
node per event.



	10H now allows 300, 1200 and 2400 for allç
operations; whether your modem can or not is your business.ç
This applies to baud rate detect for users as well asç
Fidonet incoming and outgoing calls. 

	Due to a peculiarity in the UARTs used on all serialç
ports, at 2400 baud whacking CR will not work to determineç
baud rate; you must hit the space bar instead. Fido willç
accept CR or space at all baud rates, but you must use spaceç
at 2400. It is not a software problem but a hardware one.




	The file K)ill command now works. It will prompt forç
a filename, accept wildcards, and will delete the names fromç
FILES.BBS.




	The Novation SmartCat works now. The problem wasç
that Novation radically changed the command structure, andç
provided a manual errata sheet; I did not have the errataç
sheet. The 300 baud only Hayes should work as well; theç
problem was that the modem sends all results with odd orç
even parity, and Fido did not strip it when looking forç
result codes.




	For those who care, the packet names for Fidonetç
messages and file lsts has changed. The new format is:

	mmmmnnnn.OUT
	mmmmnnnn.FLO

	Where:

	mmmm is the Net #, in Hex, zero filled, and
	nnnn is the Node #, in hex, also zero filled.

	For instance, a packet destined for Node #56 in Netç
#78, the packet name is:

	004E0038.OUT
	004E0038.FLO




	On the same subject, a new keyword has been added toç
the route list, beyond the changes mentioned below. This is:

	EXTERNAL-MAIL

	This causes FidoNet to not delete it's packets andç
file lists, and mark all mail packeted as (SENT), or Killedç
as necessary. This is specifically for the case whereç
FidoNet messages are transferred manually through some sortç
of gateway, such as a mainframe. This entire process can nowç
be automated by:

(1)	Creating a schedule to handle the mail that is to beç
shipped in an abnormal fashion. Make the schedule only oneç
minute long.

(2)	Make an External schedule terminate with someç
detectable value, immediately following the special Fidonetç
schedule.

(3)	In the route list for that schedule, add the keywordç
EXTERNAL-MAIL.


	This complicated process causes Fidonet to createç
the packets and file lists for the specified node(s),ç
leaving them on disk, and marking the messages as if theyç
were sent normally. The external event must be used toç
"mail" the packets. When this external mailing is complete,ç
Fido can be returned to normal operation, either to Fidoç
mode or another FidoNet event.

	Please note that if you "blow it", and lose theç
packets, the process cannot be repeated for the sameç
messages, as FidoNet will marked them as sent as if theyç
were mailed in the usual fashion. Packets should be deletedç
when complete. MMMMNNNN.FLO is a string of pathnames; it canç
be fed to a comm. program to transfer any attached files asç
well. The receiving end will need to correlate the lists ofç
files with the message packets.




	Changed the message status display from (FORWARDED)ç
to (IN TRANSIT). Much more meaningful. Only the message isç
changed.




	FidoNet message entry (picking a node number) hasç
changed, and there is a new help file; NODES.HLP. This isç
displayed by entering ? at the prompt for a net/node numberç
at the E)nter message prompt in the FidoNet section.




PREVIOUSLY UNDOCUMENTED:

	"New" questionaire: QNEWUSER.BBS. Answers go intoç
ANEWUSER.BBS. 

	This is in the new-user signon loop. This is for newç
or existing users who don't get to log on. (Either a privateç
system, or they forgot their password.)

	There are now two ways to handle this case; theç
first is the current way: NOPWD.BBS is displayed, the userç
gets to enter a message to the sysop, then is logged off.

	Now however, if the questionaire QNEWUSER.BBSç
exists, the get to fill out the questionaire instead ofç
NOPWD.BBS, and then logged off immediately, instead of aç
message to the sysop. The questionaire can be only displayedç
text, for the case where you do not want any input from newç
users.




PREVIOUSLY UNDOCUMENTED:

	For all .BBS text files (bulletins, etc) two controlç
characters allow disabling and enabling users Control-C andç
Control-K:

	^B	Prevent Control-C aborts
	^C	Allow Control-C aborts

	If ^B is found, the caller cannot abort the displayç
of a .BBS text file. ^C reenables it. The default isç
enabled.

EXAMPLE:

	^B
	This cannot be canceled with Control-C
	^C
	This and all following text can be canceled withç
Control-C.




PREVIOUSLY UNDOCUMENTED:

	At the prompt for entering a node number, a diskç
file can be specified instead of a node number. (This wasç
SYSOP only in previous versions.) The disk file name mustç
not start with a digit. The disk file is assumed to containç
a list of node numbers, as would be entered manually. Theç
limit is 300 characters maximum.




	The following structures have been changed. Theç
route table has been deleted, and its functions moved intoç
nmap. Most other changes consist of using previously zeroç
fields.

	Starred items were filled in as zeros in previousç
versions.

/* Message header structure. The message text is just a longç
string. */

struct _msg {
	char from[36];		/* who from, */
	char to[36];		/* who to, */
	char subj[72];		/* message subject, */
	char date[20];		/* creation date, */
	int times;		/* number of times read, */
	int dest;		/* destination node, */
	int orig;		/* originating node */
	int cost;		/* actual cost of msg */
*	int orig_net;		/* originating net */
*	int dest_net;		/* destination net */
	int caca[4];		/* extra space, */
	unsigned reply;
	int attr;		/* message type, below */
	int up;	
};


/* MAIL.SYS file structure */

struct _mail {
	int node;		/* local node number, */
	float fudge;
	int rate;		/* baud rate */
	char mailpath[80];	/* path to find mail in */
	char filepath[80];	/* mail file path */
	int net;		/* net number */
	int alt_node;
	int alt_net;
};

	The net field was added, and the node (.number)ç
field has a special meaning when the net number is -1.

	NET	NODE
	-1	 xx	NODELIST.SYS revision
	xx	 00	Defines a HOST

	The first entry in NODELIST.SYS is the revisionç
record. Fido 10I checks for a correct revision marker, andç
if it does not match, Fido recompiles NODELIST.SYS.

/* Node descriptor. (NODELIST.SYS) */

struct _node {
int number;		/* node number, */
int net;		/* net number */
int cost;		/* cost per minute to call */
int rate;		/* baud rate */
char sched;		/* schedule tag */
char name[14];		/* node name */
char phone[40];		/* phone number */
char city[40];		/* city and state, */
};

/* Message packet header. */

#define PKTVER 2

struct _pkthdr {
	int orig_node;		/* originating Node # */
	int dest_node;		/* destination node */
	int year,month,day,hour,minute,second;
	int rate;		/* baud rate */
	int ver;		/* packet version */
*	int orig_net;		/* originating net number */
*	int dest_net;		/* destination net number */
	int extra[17];
};

FidoNet network organization change 
T. Jennings
10 April 85

	This covers the new capabilities of Fido versionç
10I. Please do not implement net numbers yet! In order toç
use net numbers, we have to get the entire net swapped overç
to this new software, and issue net numbers.

	If you do not do so already, please make sure youç
read FidoNews, the FidoNet newsletter. All network changesç
are being discussed there. Get back issues if necessary.ç
This is extremely important if you are part of the publicç
domain FidoNet.

	FidoNews can be downloaded from Fido #375, where itç
is published, or from most Fido systems, such as #1 or #51.




	10H starts a new type of FidoNet organization. It isç
backwards compatible, but we will be swapping over to theç
new method as soon as possible. This new organization allowsç
organizing the net and the node list on a region by regionç
basis, instead of the monolithic centrally managed list,ç
though there will still be a central list.

	In previous versions, each different system wasç
identified by a single number, the node number. This worksç
just fine, and the number of nodes that can be accomodatedç
is 32,767. 

	The new way allows a second identifier, the netç
number. There can be 32,767 nets, each with 32,767 nodes.ç
Not likely we'll use up all the numbers!

	One annoyance when trying to enter a Fidonet messageç
on old Fidos is if you type "?" at the E command prompt, youç
get 250 node listings ... not exactly what most people likeç
to see. The prompt now asks:

	?=Help, #=List NODES /=List NETS

	Entering / will list all the local nets; you willç
probably get no more than 20 listings, a very manageableç
number. Once you select a net, you can then enter # to listç
the nodes in that net; once again, a very manageable number,ç
the biggest net is SoCal, with 30 something nodes.

	It also allows you to enter a specific net/nodeç
combination all at once, like:

	55/66

	Which means Net #55, Node #66. Handy if you sendç
mail to a specific node all the time.



	Before everyone gets a copy of 10H, the net willç
operate as it does now. Everyone will belong in Net #1. Busyç
areas such as SoCal and STL will eventually become their ownç
nets; they will be assigned one net number for the entireç
region, and after that they can pick node numbers as theyç
please.

	STL will pass out net numbers as it now does nodeç
numbers. Each local net will generate its own node list,ç
with routing tables, etc just like Fido 51 in STL does now.ç
The format will be axactly the same. STL will then merelyç
take those local nodelists, stick them all together, andç
pass it out. 

	Nodes that dont fall into any local net will remainç
part of Net #1, just like it is now. If there is only one ofç
you in East Overshoe, you wont be burdened with the extraç
work involving a local node list.


NODE LIST CHANGES

	The node list has to be changed as well. The changeç
here is also pretty minimal. There has to be some way toç
specify which net a node belongs to.

	The current scheme assumes we are in the same net.ç
(Well, we ARE, and we will remain so.) An example oldç
fashioned node list entry looks like:

....
0050  25 1200 Crystal_Caver1-512-263-5805 Austin.........TX
0051  25 1200 DECUS_Central1-314-432-4129 St_Louis.......MO
0052  25 1200 TOPCC        1-805-499-8378 Thousand_Oaks..CA
0053  25 1200 S.E._Prof_Fid1-404-928-1876 Woodstock......GA
....

	All of the nodes are in numeric order as well. Theç
new scheme involves two changes:

	(1)	Placing all of a local net's nodes in the
		same place in the node list,

	(2)	Specifying the local nets host at the top of 
		the list.

	IMPORTANT: It is an absolute no-no to "sort" theç
node list. This will totally wreck everything. The order ofç
the node list is now an important part of its structure. DOç
NOT CHANGE THE ORDER OF THE NODE LIST! There were two majorç
reasons for doing this, both not needed any more: (1) to putç
your own node at the top of the list, so Fido wouldnt be soç
damn slow listing message. Repaired: Fido wont list the nodeç
name and location if it is  YOUR NODE. (2) sorting by cityç
and state to make the list manageable. The organizationç
itself takes care of this.


	Two keywords has been introduced into the node list;ç
the word "HOST" and "REGION", these change the meaning ofç
the node list entry it is on. Both are handled the same, butç
HOST automatically does routing that used to be done in theç
route lists. More on this later.

	A sample entry for a local net is shown below. Noteç
that all of the St. Louis nodes follow one another; they canç
no longer be sprinkled through the node list.

	The special line before the normal listing for nodeç
4 defines the local nets host. The "2" is not the nodeç
number, but the net number. It says that all node entriesç
that follow it belong to net #2, until another HOST line isç
found.

	Note also that the host is also a regular node, 51.ç
The HOST line merely defines who is the host. This entry, asç
you might expect after thinking about it, does affectç
routing; this is covered below. A host is also treated asç
"node 0", so that it is possible to send a message to "host"ç
or 51, and the message will get there. This is a specialç
case, and has a special meaning also covered below.


HOST 2 25 1200 DECUS_Central1-314-432-4129 St_Louis.......MO
0004  25 1200 Bulldog      1-314-441-9297 St_Louis.......MO
0010  25 1200 MDC_RCC      1-314-234-1462 St_Louis.......MO
0016  25 1200 Mikes_Board  1-314-726-3448 St_Louis.......MO
0017  25 1200 DCA_BBS      1-314-962-0395 St_Louis.......MO
0022  25 1200 PCLUG        1-314-576-2743 St_Louis.......MO
0051  25 1200 DECUS_Central1-314-432-4129 St_Louis.......MO


HOW THIS AFFECTS ROUTING

	The routeing works as previously documented; theç
only real change is that Fido will do some of itç
automaticaly now instead of having to be put into the routeç
list.

	HOST basically causes automatic routing to be doneç
by Fido, instead of requiring route lists as in previousç
versions. 

	Once we swap over to the new method, you will notç
need to pecify the routing for hosts. When you enter aç
message to say Fido #4, Fido will automatically route it toç
Fido #51 for you.

	REGION does not do any of this automatic routing; itç
only affects how messages are entered and listed.

	Mail within your own net is never affected by thisç
special routing; if you and another node are both in theç
same net, then mail you send there will go directly, just asç
in previous versions. (You can of course specify routingç
still in the route list, but you have to do it on purpose.)

ROUTE LISTS

	Route lists are the ROUTE.BBS, ROUTE.A, ROUTE.B, etcç
files.

	You can still specify routing as necessary, likeç
before. The only difference is that if the nodes are not inç
your own net, you will have to specify the net number asç
well as the node number. This is described in detail below.

	Fido also understands a special "node number", theç
word "ALL". This means "all nodes in all nets". This isç
useful for incoming hosts, to allow routing mail from anyç
node in the world to their own local nodes. For instance:

send-to 4,16,17,22,10,76
accept-from all

	... allows Fido #51 to receive mail from the worldç
and send it to it's own local nodes.


	There is also a new keyword that Fido understands,ç
its use will become obvious later:

Net N

	Assume Net #N as the default net for all followingç
route list statements. This is only to allow easy entry ofç
lots of net/node number combinations. This will be explainedç
further below.


NET/NODE NUMBERS

	Previous versions accepted only node numbers onç
route statements, such as "send-to 11,22,33,44" or "scheduleç
B 66,77,88,99", etc. These forms are still accepted, butç
Fido assumes that the node numbers belong to your own net.

	To specify nodes not in your net, you must use theç
"long form" of node/net, such as "send-to 4/11,4/22,4/33" orç
"schedule B  100/66,100/77,100/88", etc. 

	When you specify the same net number a lot, you canç
use the new "NET" keyword. What it does is set the defaultç
net to NN, instead of assuming your own net number. One ofç
the above lines could be done as:

Net 100
schedule b 66,77,88,99

	.........................................

		DECOUPLED MODE

	Fido 10h also has a new mode to accomodate seperateç
networks; decoupled mode. Decoupled here means that insteadç
of knowing all about all nodes in a different (from the oneç
you are in) net, it will allow mail to nodes within aç
different net knowing only the host.

	Currently, when you enter a node number, Fido checksç
it againts the list; if not found, Fido complains. Thisç
requires that all nodes in all nets be in the nodelist.

	In the future, this may be impractical, especiallyç
for "private" nets. Decoupled mode basically tells Fido toç
not care if it can't find a specific node in a specific net. 

	Note that this only affects different networks; Fidoç
still requires knowing all about nodes within the currentç
network.

	In decoupled mode, when a node number entered cannotç
be found in the list for that net, Fido sends it to node #0,ç
the host for that net. The host must be in the nodelist. Ifç
when routing a message that does not appear in the nodeç
tables, it will be sent to the host as well.

	Decoupled mode is enabled with /C on the commandç
line. Please do not use it for normal FidoNet operation.

--------------------------------------------------------

	Fido Version 10C Errata Sheet
	T. Jennings  25 Jan 85

	These are changes made in version 10c from previousç
version 10's. Note that this may conflict with what theç
manual says; please note the changes.


	MESSAGE AREAS

	Finally, yes finally, Fido understands the idea ofç
'Last Message Read'. You no longer have to memorize whereç
you left off reading messages since you were last on.

	Fido now remembers the last message you read in theç
LAST NINE MESSAGE AREAS, not all of them. This is becauseç
that is all the extra space I could find in the userç
records. It should be fine for most Fidos.

	When you enter a message area, Fido will tell you:

"Highest msg is HH, last one you read was LL"

	This will tell you if there are any messages thereç
that you haven't read. A little known fact of previous Fidosç
was that "*" meant HIGHEST MESSAGE; when you entered "R *"ç
it read the highest message.

	* now means "The one after the last one you read".ç
So, to start reading where you left off, just enter:

	R *

	And if the last message you read was 50, it willç
start displaying messages at 51. You can enter * anytimeç
Fido asks you for a message number.

SYSOPS:

	The renumber command (8) will correct the messageç
numbers now stored in the user list. The old program,ç
RENUM.EXE, will not handle the message numbers stored in theç
user list; everyone will be confused. Do not use it anymore.


	.........................................

MODEMS

	Fido is a lot smarter about modems now. Since itç
already knows what type of modem you are using (the /Jç
switch) it might as well initialize the modem the way itç
wants, instead of forcing you to use the complicatedç
FIDOMDM.BBS.

	Fido will initialize the modem for youç
automatically; AFTER THAT, it will do the initializationç
with FIDOMDM.BBS as specified in the manual. This allows youç
to override Fido's default initialization if yuo want; 99%ç
of all installations will not need to however. You can nowç
(and should) DELETE FIDOMDM.BBS.

	The IBM PC Junior has it's own modem type, andç
Novation SmartCat will work properly, even with XMODEM. 

NEW MODEM TYPES

	These are the modem types specified with the /Jç
switch.

	1	Hayes
	2	DF03
	3	Racal Vadic VA212
	4	Novation SmartCat
	5	US Robotics
	7	Prentice POPCOM
	8	IBM PC Junior

	NOTE: For PopCom and GDC modems, and all modems thatç
are a "superset" of the Hayes, any additional initializationç
must be done in FIDOMDM.BBS.

	.........................................

FIDONET ROUTING:

	These changes afect only those Fidos acting as hostsç
for other Fidos. If you are not a host, then ignore this, orç
maybe read it out of curiosity.

	Some very substantial changes were made here. If youç
are a host, you will have to make changes; however, theç
changes should be a pleasant suprise instead of a pain.

MULTIPLE ROUTE LISTS:

	Instead of just the single route list, ROUTE.BBS,ç
Fido will support one route list per schedule. It is simple:

	Schedule A	ROUTE.A
	Schedule B	ROUTE.B
	...		...
	Schedule W	ROUTE.W

	The way it works is: Fido first looks for theç
specific route list, if it doesn't find it, it usesç
ROUTE.BBS as before.


NEW ROUTING COMMANDS

	The contents of the route list have been changed,ç
too. One keyword was dropped, and one more added.

FORWARD-TO	No longer supported

SEND-TO 	node node node node ...

	Now by default, ALL NODES ARE MARKED "FORWARD-TO".ç
The ACCEPT-FROM list is the only thing that controls whichç
messages go out. It turns out that the FORWARD-TO wasç
totally redundant in every working route list examined; Iç
won't go into the details here why. Any FORWARD-TOs foundç
will be totally ignored.

	The big problem was that a host needs to run moreç
than one schedule, and there was only one route list. Thisç
meant that there had to be conflicting or overlappingç
ACCEPT-FROMs and FORWARD-TOs; with the new multiple routeç
lists, there are no more conflicts.

	Also, since when you are editing a route list, youç
only have to think about the one schedule; you will findç
that they are now very small, and easy to read.

	The new keyword, SEND-TO is like SCHEDULE: it means,ç
"In this schedule (whatever it is) send mail to these nodes"ç
followed by a list of nodes. For instance, if it is scheduleç
B, and you are to send mail to your local nodes, you wouldç
say "SEND-TO node node node node ...". It is the same asç
saying (in this example) "SCHEDULE B node node node nodeç
...". You can think of it as doing "SCHEDULE (the currentç
schedule) node node node ...".

SPECIAL NODE NUMBER:

	A special "number" has been added, and can be usedç
anywhere that you would put a list of node numbers:

	ALL	all nodes in the list

	For instance, if you route all your mail to a singleç
outgoing host, instead of putting in all possible numbersç
(tedious, when there are 150 nodes), you can now do:

ROUTE-TO xx ALL

	This works with SCHEDULE, SEND-TO, ACCEPT-FROM andç
ROUTE-TO.

AN EXAMPLE:

	You are both incoming and outgoing host for nodesç
101, 102, and 103. You are node 200. (This used to be theç
worst thing possible; the way you had to to it before wasç
ACCEPT-FROM all and FORWARD-TO all; this meant it would sendç
anyones mail anywhere!). 

SCHEDULES:
	B	12:30AM - 12:59 AM	local to host
	A	1:00 - 2:00 AM		national
	C	2:01 - 2:30 AM		host to local


ROUTE.B:

	(empty, host is read only)


ROUTE.A:

	ACCEPT-FROM 101 102 103
	ROUTE-TO (the usual route-to's)

ROUTE.C:

	ACCEPT-FROM ALL
	SEND-TO 101 102 103


	Nice and simple. Make sure there is no ROUTE.BBS.ç
ROUTE.B does nothing in the host; since it's only waitingç
for mail from the locals, it doesnt need (or want!) to sendç
to anyone. It is just gathering messages that may be sentç
during Schedule A.

	ROUTE.A says it's OK to send out mail only from it'sç
local nodes, plus obviously any mail entered at the host.ç
The ROUTE-TOs are the ones out of the node list. Since onlyç
the locals are listed under ACCEPT-FROM, mail from say nodeç
#1 will not be sent, but marked as ORPHAN.

	ROUTE.C says forward mail from any node (ACCEPT-FROMç
...) but send only to the locals 101, 102, 103. 


	I think I hear some groaning out there, but theç
changes will be worth it. It means that you can nowç
implement any network of any complexity and number of levelsç
with no worries of forwarding mail you do not want to.
