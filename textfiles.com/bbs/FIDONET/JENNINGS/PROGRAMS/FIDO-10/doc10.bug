Copies to #1 and #10 because parts of this apply to both of you.
Here is a list of various problems I have found on a first reading
of the new Fido documentation for V.10 (downloaded 20 Nov. from #1).
I think the file is not quite finished yet (mainly because there is no
index at the end) so I probably have listed here several things you already
caught.

Typo's:  (admittedly nit-picking)
p. 6 Item (3) "users time limits." should be "user's time limits."
p. 35 last sentence bad, suggest: "This is the most secure method;
      it is reccomended only if you require absolute security on upload
      files.
p. 58 "Contact TJ at #1" should now point to #51.
p. 85 "systems node number" s.b. "system's node number"

There are still several references to the now-obsolete manuals:
pp. 30, 58, 59, and 74.

P. 85 says that new nodelists are broadcast; #51 has recently told everbody
to go get it themselves as the network is too big to do this now.

Omissions, features in need of revised descriptions, etc:
Tom:  There are a lot of trademarks floating around in there that really
should be identified (on page 2) for legal reasons.  Disclaimers 
maybe should be here too.
P. 21 - (I already told this one but here it is again for completeness)
Pin 7 is the signal common or ground and should be here;  Pin 1 
is not enough and could cause ground loop problems.
P. 37 - the new /W should be documented here.
p. 48 - "Tabs on or off" - perhaps Tab EXPANSION on or off?  I really don't
understand the way this works from the way it is worded.  Which way should
it be set for a dumb terminal that does nothing with TABs?
p. 53 - Locate.  It should be noted that this searches the FILES.BBS in 
each area, but does not actually check the directory contents.  Note 
this is the opposite of the way downloading *.* works - it catches 
anything in the directory even if it is not in the FILES.BBS.  This
inconsistancy is confusing to the user trying to correlate the two.
p. 54 - Document the Raw-display command.
Completely missing and needed several places throughout - documentation on
how the attach-file feature works on message transfers.
Also missing - what is the UNITS of the COST computation?  Tom, I think
one of your doc updates had a good description of how this works now.
p. 59 - External events X and Z - Tom: you once sent me mail that these
really didn't do what was expected, something about the modem actually
disconnects but DTR still high allows it to answer the phone.  I had
originally intended to use this as the new 0 commands now works.
Is the Z event really analogous to the 0 command or just how does it work?
What are some suggested or potential uses, or is this now a pink elephant?

Conflict:  P. 36 shows options D and K as 24-hour limits, but p. 27 in 
the example uses 48 hours.  Is this a change in V. 10?

The new 0 command - you hit the nail on the head about needing a watchdog
program.  I am willing to pay $$$$ for a command processor that really
does this, if you know of one or can convince somebody to make one
PLEASE LET ME KNOW!!!!  I would love to use this feature.

Questions:
What happens to Fidonet during the transition in/out of Daylight Savings Time?

The following appeared as bugs although I probably haven't mentioned it until
now, they may be fixed already:  Adding a reply to a net-message puts the
+ pointer on the original, and the - pointer on the reply.  If it was queued
with Kill/Sent the + pointer is left pointing to a non-existant message.  
Another problem is that after replying to a message, it forces me into reading
the Previous message.  What I really want is to have it go back into the
MSG menu prompt, or at least into the Next message.  There was a bug with the
sysop 1 command; it refused to actually change anything (as viewed with 
just the "1" command alone) when you were not in the MAIN menu (this is not
a case of forgetting the "1 S").

Comments:
Sysop console ^o, ^n, and ^t commands: NICE TOUCH!
Did I see something about host-host exchanges with some sort of reverse
billing feature?  I can't find it again.  Anyway I would like a way to
send a message requesting that the remote system send
me a file - this way I could effect a download during fidonet time, yet
let the reciepient pay for the call.  The only alternative now is to
request that the sysop send me the file in the usual way, and then the
wrong party pays for the call.  Also it seems logical to me to have message
traffic be bi-directional during one connect; (not file transfers!).
As long as you got the connection you might as well take care of it all, 
and I doubt if non-file message transfers cost enough to matter which way
the charges go.  OH yes, somebody just told me that File-messages need
special treatment when a host is used in a local net.  Apparently Fido does
not forward files to the final destination.  All of this should be documented.
I believe what happens in this case is that Fidonet sends file-messages 
directly without routing.
It is not clear to me when a message is actually charged to an account-
if costs get charged for all messages if any one gets thru, does this mean
that when the message tries again the next night it will be billed twice?
And what about left-over Fidonet-internal .OUT, etc. files - if the
system crashed during Fidonet time, does restarting Fido clean up after
everything?

Suggestions:
It would really be nice to be able to use prefix codes in my nodelist for
the various methods of making a call, when several means of long-distance
service is available.  It's cumbersome trying to put it in every entry.

It would really be helpfull to me to be able to SET the privelege level
needed to send attached file messages; this is too usefull a feature to
restrict to just sysops.

And, come to think of it, how about separate privelege settings for each file 
and message section in the same area, rather than a level for both sections
in one area number.  This would un-bundle the message and file section from
the area groupings, straightening out the apparent area structures.
(The user sees several areas UNDER file or message sections; the sysop sees
just the opposite.)

How about a separate document briefly describing the differences from version
9, and what one has to do to upgrade existing systems?

I think I really prefered the separate documents, but oh well.

TOM: missing from your Fido area FILES.BBS is QUOTES.BBS and NOPWD.BBS,
also dir.bbs.  Since these do get caught in a *.* download, they should
be documented in the Files.bbs.  Also in the FILES.BBS: "see INSTALL.DOC."
