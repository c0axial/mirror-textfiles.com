ABOUT COMPUTERS, FREEDOM & PRIVACY
----------------------------------

We are at a crossroads as individuals, organizations andç
governments depend more and more on computers and computerç
networks. Within ten years, most global information will beç
collected and utilized electronically. The 1990's are the pivotalç
decade in which statutes, policies and judicial precedents willç
be developed for controlling access, use -- and abuse -- ofç
computerized information and electronic mail.

Current government and private-sector policies are anç
uncoordinated jumble, created as each group evolves ways toç
collect, manipulate, extract, share and protect computerized andç
networked information and services. 

Data on individuals and groups is being computerized by numerousç
agencies, organizations and special interests, often without theç
knowledge or approval of those it concerns, and with varyingç
degrees of accuracy. 

Computers can greatly assist individuals, organizations andç
government in making sound decisions based on efficient access toç
adequate information -- for personal benefit, businessç
improvement and national well-being.

Or, inappropriate use and regulation can seriously threatenç
fundamental freedoms, personal privacy, and the democraticç
processes that are at the very foundation of this nation and ofç
any free society.

ABOUT THIS PREMIER EVENT
------------------------

This is an intensive, multi-disciplinary survey Conference forç
those concerned with computing, teleconferencing, electronicç
mail, computerized personal information, direct marketingç
information, government data, etc. -- and those concerned withç
computer-related legislation, regulation, computer security, lawç
enforcement and national and international policies that impactç
civil liberties, responsible exercise of freedom and equitableç
protection of privacy in this global Information Age.

For the first time, this four-day invitational event will bringç
together representatives from all of these groups and more, allç
in one place, all at one time.

Many of the recognized leaders and strongest advocatesç
representing the various groups having an interest in the issuesç
of the conference will discuss their concerns and proposals.

A maximum of 600 applicants will be invited to attend. Balancedç
representation from the diverse groups interested in these issuesç
is being encouraged. Please see the enclosed Invitationç
Application for details.

To inform participants about topics beyond their specialties,ç
half-day seminars are scheduled for the first day (Monday, Marchç
25th). These parallel tutorials will explore relevant issues inç
computing, networking, civil liberties, regulation, the law andç
law enforcement. Each tutorial is designed for those who areç
experienced in one area, but are less knowledgeable in theç
subject of that tutorial.

To explore the interactions and ramifications of the issues,ç
conference talks and panel discussions are scheduled for theç
remaining three days (Tuesday-Thursday, March 26th-28th). Theseç
will emphasize balanced representation of all major views,ç
especially including probing questions and discussion.

Explicit Conference events to foster communication acrossç
disciplines are planned. Working luncheons, major breaks and twoç
evening banquets will further encourage individual and small≠
group discussions.
