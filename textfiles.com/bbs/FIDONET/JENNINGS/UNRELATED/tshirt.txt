IMPORTANT NOTE: These T-shirts are only available *now* -- well,ç
until say the middle of November 1991. Why? Because we've onlyç
got few screens, and we strip the old images off and reuse them.ç
So hurry up if you're interested. (You can always ask; drop aç
note (preferably by FidoNet).

The OMNIARCHY T-shirts have on the front a large "circle O" (likeç
the circled "A" of anarchism, but better) with "OMNIARCHY!"ç
emblazoned beneath it for the less well-informed. On the back itç
says in huge letters "WE'RE ALL IN CHARGE!" and in teensy lettersç
up at the top, "Shred of Dignity", which is us in anotherç
disguise.

The Alan M. Turing shirt has a '51 photo of AMT and theç
inscription:

		Alan Mathison Turing (1912--1954)

	Invented the stored-program digital computer (1936); 
	broke WWII German ENIGMA cypher (1941); defined modern 
	programming concepts (1946); designed world's first 
	operating computer (Manchester, June, 1948); openly and 
	unapologetically homosexual.

The LIBERTY T-shirt is a slight (ahem) variation on the famousç
and beautiful Standing Liberty from the turn of the centuryç
20-dollar gold piece ("golden eagle"). She's had a fashionç
makeover and is now the height of late 90's paranoid Discordianç
style. In her left hand is a five-leafed branch of cannabis; inç
her right Kallisti's Golden Apple. In the background are 23 rays;ç
on her head, appropriately enough, her long flowing hair hasç
become liberty spikes. She has a Sacred Chao tattoo on her leftç
arm; one breast is bared as she stands in defiance. She's hot.ç
There's other tiny details all appropriately buried in variousç
nooks and crannies.

The calendar is a true Discordian calendar, with the five seasonsç
as outlined in PRINCIPIA DISCORDIA, for the year 3158 POEE. (Theç
old Discordian saw goes, "73 days hath Chaos, Discord, Confusion,ç
Beaurocracy and Aftermath".) Each is Illustrated in the properç
manner, and has a Julian to Discordian converter table.

"Do-It-Yourself Automotive LPG Conversion" is a 36 page bookç
describing converting my car from gasoline to LPG (propane) as aç
motor fuel. It has some background, comparison to other fuels,ç
personal experiences and a basic how-to of the process andç
equipment involved. While it may not be enough for you toç
complete the project end to end, it will tell you what'sç
involved, how it works and definitely set you in the rightç
direction. (PS: after a year and a couple of 5,000 mile roadç
trips, I can tell you it's a truly great fuel. No more gasolineç
for me!)

FidoTerm is my version of the best telecomm/modem program in theç
world. Of course, there are lots of them. Mine has a realç
programming language built in, very complete but kinda obscure.ç
It "remembers" the last few hundred screen lines. Fido/FidoNetç
can invoke it via the "F" local console command. It does ZMODEM,ç
XMODEM (both flavors) and some pretty nice text transfers.

Fido the Book and Fido/FidoNet is of course the original FidoNetç
program that started all this nonsense. It is exceedinglyç
reliable -- you can literally leave it running for months at aç
time without a hiccup. It is compact, very fast, easilyç
customizable, supports all popular file-transfer protocols, andç
probably the easiest BBS for new users and still powerful forç
experts. It's drawbacks are: only one phone line per Fidoç
(DesqView aware though) and doesn't support FidoNet HOLD packetsç
-- yet. Still the most robust and clean BBS, and the onlyç
integrated BBS/FidoNet system. The manual is a bit dated, but aç
new one is in the works and the FIDO HELP conference is filledç
with experienced sysops.

HOMOCORE BAD POETRY ISSUE #5 1/2's are still available. They areç
gigantic format, 2ft x 3ft, two sheets, with artwork on one sideç
and bad poetry on the other (what else). If occasional swearç
words and graphic sexual matter offend you, spare us both theç
trouble and don't buy one.
