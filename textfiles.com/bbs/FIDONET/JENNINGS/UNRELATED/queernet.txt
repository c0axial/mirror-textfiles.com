Well, mine either.  Then again, I can think of lots of us who are anywhere
from dead center to the fringes of the queer world ("community" is much too
loaded a word here in some ways) who are also active in the online or
high-tech realm as well.  (I can think of queer activists who work for ç
Oracle,
SGI, Sun... and the list goes on...)

> PS: what is QUEERNET.ORG...

queernet.org is a domain I registered to handle internet news/mail feeding ç
for
Bay Area queers' systems, as well as logins for friends and ç
friends-of-friends
who don't have their own systems (or don't feel like setting up uupc or the
like)... Pretty soon the gateway machine will be on the Internet as well.
