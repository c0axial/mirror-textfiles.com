                               OVERVIEW                                OVERVIEW 



FidoNet is an amateur electronic mail system.  As  such,  all  of  its 
participants  and  operators  are non-paid volunteers.  From its early 
beginnings as a few friends swapping messages back and forth,  it  has 
now  grown  to  (October  1985)  almost  500 different systems in four 
countries.  

FidoNet is now large enough that it would quickly fall  apart  of  its 
own  weight  unless some sort of structure and control were imposed on 
it.   Multinet  operation  provided   the   structure.   Decentralized 
management  provided  the  control.  This  document  is  an attempt to 
describe the procedures  which  have  been  developed  to  manage  the 
network.  


1.1     The Levels of FidoNet 1.1     The Levels of FidoNet 

With  the  introduction  of  multinet Fido in early 1985,  FidoNet has 
developed a hierarchical structure, with the following levels: 

o   The national coordinator                                           o   The national coordinator; The national coordinator compiles all of 
    the node lists from all of the regions and  networks  and  creates 
    the master node list, which is then distributed over the net.  

o   The  regional  coordinator                                         o   The  regional  coordinator;  The coordinator maintains the list of 
    independent nodes in his region,  and encourages  independents  to 
    join  existing  nets  or to form new nets.  A coordinator does not 
    perform routing services for the nodes in his region.  

o   The network host                                                   o   The network host; The host is responsible for maintaining the list 
    of nodes for his net,  and for receiving and forwarding  any  mail 
    coming to the net from outside.  

o   The network routing hub                                           o   The network routing hub; Network routing hubs exist only in three-
    tiered  regional  nets.  They  generally  share some or all of the 
    duties of the host,  in order to ease the management  of  a  large 
    regional  net.  The  exact  duties and procedures are a matter for 
    the host and his hubs to settle,  and will not be discussed  here.  
    The  network  host is still responsible for the maintenance of the 
    net.  

o   The system operator (sysop)                                        o   The system operator (sysop);  The sysop formulates his own  policy 
    for running his board and dealing with his users, so that will not 
    be discussed in this document.  However,  the sysop must also mesh 
    with the rest of the FidoNet system if he is to send  and  receive 
                   ____                         mail, and that will be discussed here.  

o   The  user                                                          o   The  user;  Policy  and  procedures for the individual user on any 
    given board is determined by the system operator  of  that  board, 
    and will not be considered in this document.

                           SYSOP PROCEDURES                            SYSOP PROCEDURES 



A  sysop  of  an individual node can pretty much do as he pleases,  as 
long as he observes the mail events and is not excessively annoying to 
other nodes on the net  and  does  not  promote  the  distribution  of 
pirated copyrighted software.  

An  independent  node  which  is  not part of a regional net need only 
observe the National Mail Hour.  

National Mail Hour is the heart of FidoNet,  as this is  when  network 
mail  is passed between systems.  Any system which wishes to be a part 
           ____                                                        of FidoNet must be able to receive mail at this time.  Failure  to  do 
so  is  sufficient  grounds  for  any  node to be dropped from the net 
without notice (since notice is generally given by FidoNet mail).  

If you find yourself "in the dog house"  (shown  at  the  end  of  the 
national node list),  then that means that your host or coordinator is 
unable to contact you.  You should  rectify  the  problem  and  report 
back.  

National  Mail  Hour  is  observed  from  0900  to 1000 GMT every day, 
weekends included.  In each of the  United  States  time  zones,  this 
would be as follows: 

    Eastern Standard Time         4 AM to 5 AM
    Central Standard Time         3 AM to 4 AM
    Mountain Standard Time        2 AM to 3 AM
    Pacific Standard Time         1 AM to 2 AM
    Hawaii Standard Time         11 PM to Midnight

               ___                                                     FidoNet  does  not  observe  daylight  savings  time.  In  areas which 
observe daylight savings time  the  FidoNet  mail  schedules  must  be 
adjusted  in  the  same direction as the clock change.  Alternatively, 
you can simply leave your system on standard time.  


If you are in a regional net,  then you will probably be  required  to 
schedule  additional  mail  events.  Check  with your network host for 
more details.  














FidoNet Policy and Procedures   Page   2                         Sysop
2.1     How to get a node number 2.1     How to get a node number 

You must first obtain a current node list,  so that you can send mail.  
You  do not need a node number to send mail,  but you must have one in 
order for others to send mail to you.  

The first step in obtaining a current node list is to  locate  a  Fido 
bulletin  board.  No  help  there;  you're on your own.  Most bulletin 
board lists include at least a few Fido systems,  and usually identify 
them as such, so this shouldn't be too hard.  

If  the  sysop  of any Fido system does not have a node list available 
for downloading, then he can probably tell you where to get one.  

Once you have a node list,  you must determine  which  net  or  region 
covers  your  area.  Nets  are  listed first,  and always have a three 
digit number.  Nets are more restricted in area than regions,  but are 
generally preferred since they provide more services to their members.  

If you cannot find a net which covers your area,  then pick the region 
which does.  Regions are listed after  nets  in  the  node  list,  and 
always have a two digit number.  The United States is divided into ten 
regions,  so  that  you  are certainly in a region even if you are not 
near a net.  

Once you have located the net or region in your area,  send a  request 
for  a  node  number  to node zero of that net or region.  The request 
____                              ____                                 must be sent by FidoNet mail, and must include at least the following: 

    1) Your name.
    2) Your current mailing address.
    3) Your telephone number (voice).
    4) The name of your system.
    5) The city and state where your system is located.
    6) The phone number to be used when calling your system.
    7) Your hours of operation.
    8) The maximum baud rate you can support.

Your host or coordinator may want additional information.  If  so,  he 
will contact you.  

Please allow two weeks for a node number request to be processed.  


2.2     If you are going down 2.2     If you are going down 

If  your  node will be down for an extended period (more than a day or 
two), then you should inform your network host or regional coordinator 
___________________                                                    as soon as possible.  If you do not do this,  then other systems  will 
still  try  to reach you while you are down,  much to the annoyance of 
           ______________________________                              everyone.  Do not under any circumstances put an answering machine  or 
similar device on your phone line while you are down.  If you do, then 
calling  systems  will  get  the machine repeatedly,  racking up large 
                      ____            phone bills, which is very annoying.  

If your system goes down without warning,  then you may be  placed  in 
the dog house, or even removed from the node list completely.

2.3     How to join a net 2.3     How to join a net 

If  you  are  an independent node and would like to join a net in your 
area, you must contact the network host.  He can be reached by sending 
FidoNet mail to node zero of the  net.  He  will  inform  you  of  any 
special  mail  schedules  and/or  routing  required  by the net.  Your 
regional coordinator will contact you to confirm that you wish to join 
the net.  Once you have been placed in the net,  you will be  informed 
by the network host.  

There  are  many  advantages  to  being  in a regional net.  First and 
foremost is that it helps reduce congestion of the net during National 
Mail Hour.  Also, many nets are "outbound" as well as "inbound", which 
can substantially reduce your phone bills.  In addition,  net  members 
receive  regular  updates  of  the  node  list and Fidonews,  while an 
independent node may not.  


2.4     How to form a net 2.4     How to form a net 

If there are several nodes in your area, but no regional net, then you 
may wish to form your own.  Again,  this  has  several  advantages  as 
outlined above.  

Your first step is to contact the other sysops in your area.  You must 
decide which nodes will comprise the net,  and which of those nodes is 
going to be the inbound  host.  Your  next  step  is  to  inform  your 
regional  coordinator.  You  must  send him a FidoNet message with the 
following information: 


1) The region number(s),  or network number(s) if a net  is  splitting 
   up,  that  are affected by the formation of your net.  The regional 
   coordinator will inform the national coordinator and the  hosts  of 
   any affected networks that a new net is in formation.  

2) The  name  that  you wish to call your net.  Please try to select a 
   name that relates to  your  grouping.  For  example,  SoCalNet  for 
   nodes   in   the   Southern   California   Area   and  MassNet  for 
   Massachusettes Area.  Remember  if  you  call  yourself  DOGNET  it 
   doesn't help others know what area of the country your group is in.  

3) A copy of the proposed net's nodelist.  The nodelist file should be 
   named  Frrr-nnn.NET where rrr is the proposed host's current region 
   or net number and nnn is his current node number.  For example,  if 
   the proposed host is currently listed as node 5 in region 13,  then 
   you would name the file F013-005.NET.  This  file  should  be  sent 
   attached to the message of application for a Net Number.

When  the  national  coordinator  receives  the  above  items from the

A network host has the following responsibilities: 

1) To receive incoming mail for nodes in his network,  and to  deliver 
   it to its recipients.  

2) To assign node numbers to nodes in his network.  

3) To maintain the node list for his network, and to send a copy of it 
   to the national coordinator whenever it changes.  

4) To  pass  along to his nodes new national node lists and new issues 
   of Fidonews as they are received.  

5) To forward newsletter submissions to the Fidonews publisher.  


3.1     Routing inbound mail 3.1     Routing inbound mail 

It is your responsibility as network host to receive all inbound  mail 
for  nodes  in  your network and to forward it to its recipients.  You 
are left to your own discretion as to how best to accomplish this.  


3.2     Assigning node numbers 3.2     Assigning node numbers 

It is your responsibility to assign node numbers to new nodes in  your 
net.  You  may  also change the numbers of existing nodes in your net, 
though you should check with your member nodes before  doing  so.  You 
may  assign  any  numbers you wish,  so long as each node has a unique 
number within your net.  

You should not assign a node number to any system unless and until you 
have received a formal request from that system by FidoNet mail.  This 
will ensure that the system is at  least  minimally  operational.  The 
strict  maintenance of this policy has been one of the great strengths 
of FidoNet.

3.3     Maintaining the node list 3.3     Maintaining the node list 

You should attempt to implement name changes,  phone  number  changes, 
etc. in your node list as soon as possible, and to forward the revised 
node list to the national coordinator whenever a change occurs.  

You  should  also on occasion send a "broadcast message" to every node 
in your network to ensure that they are still operational.  If a  node 
turns out to be "off the air" with no prior warning given to you, then 
you  can either mark the node as down,  place it in the dog house,  or 
remove it from the node list completely, at your own discretion.  

If a node in your net is acting in  a  sufficiently  annoying  manner, 
then  you  can  take  whatever  action you deem fit,  according to the 
circumstances of the case.  


3.4     Passing along node lists and Fidonews 3.4     Passing along node lists and Fidonews 

As a network host, you should from time to time receive a new issue of 
Fidonews or an updated node list.  The node list is posted  weekly  on 
Friday, and Fidonews is published weekly on Monday.  

You should pass both of these along to your member nodes as soon as is 
practical  after you receive them.  It is also desirable that you make 
them both available for downloading by the general user,  but this  is 
not required.  

Fidonews  and  the  node  lists  are  the glue that holds us together.  
Without them,  we cease to be a community,  and  become  just  another 
bunch of bulletin boards.  


3.5     Forwarding newsletter submissions 3.5     Forwarding newsletter submissions 

The  node  list  gives  us  our  structure,  but Fidonews gives us our 
character.  Fidonews is the primary medium by which sysops  hear  from 
each  other.  It  is  Fidonews  which  gives  us  the sense of being a 
community of people with common interests.  

Accordingly,  you should encourage sysops and users  in  your  net  to 
contribute  to  Fidonews.  If you receive any submissions,  you should 
forward them to the Fidonews publisher.  Think of yourself as being  a 
regional bureau chief on the Fidonews editorial staff.

A regional coordinator has the following responsibilities: 

1) To assign node numbers to independent nodes in his region.  

2) To maintain the node list for his region,  and to send a copy of it 
   to the national coordinator whenever it changes.  

3) To encourage independent nodes in his region to join existing nets, 
   or to form new nets.  

4) To pass along to inbound hosts in  his  region  new  national  node 
   lists and new issues of Fidonews as they are received.

4.1     Assigning node numbers 4.1     Assigning node numbers 

It  is your responsibility to assign node numbers to new nodes in your

region, though you should check with the respective nodes before doing 
so.  You  may assign any numbers you wish,  so long as each node has a

will ensure that the system is at  least  minimally  operational.  The 
strict  maintenance of this policy has been one of the great strengths 
of FidoNet.  

If you receive a node number request from a new node  that  is  in  an 
area covered by an existing regional net,  then you should forward the 
request to the network host instead of assigning a number yourself.

4.3     Encouraging the formation and growth of nets 4.3     Encouraging the formation and growth of nets 

One of your main duties as a regional coordinator is  to  promote  the 
growth of nets in your region.  

You  should try to avoid having independent nodes in your region which 
are within the coverage area of a regional net.  There  are,  however, 
                                  ___                                  certain cases where a node should not be a member of a net,  such as a 
commercial system with a large volume of traffic which would clog  the 
net.  The  resolution  of  such  special  cases  is  left  to your own 
discretion.  

If several independent nodes in your region are in a "clump", then you 
should encourage them to form a  regional  net.  Refer  to  the  sysop 
               forming  a regional net                                 procedure  on  forming  a regional net for details of what information 
you should get.  

Note that this does not mean to encourage  the  formation  of  trivial 
nets.  Obviously,  one  node does not make a net.  The exact number of

As a regional coordinator,  you should from time to time receive a new 
issue of Fidonews or an updated node list.  The node  list  is  posted 
weekly on Friday, and Fidonews is published weekly on Monday.  

You  should  pass  both  of  these  along to any network hosts in your 
                                                                   ___ region as soon as is practical after you receive  them.  You  are  not 
required to mail them to any independent nodes in your region,  though 
you may if you wish.  It is also desirable that  you  make  them  both 
available  for  downloading  by  the  general  user,  but  this is not 
required.

You should encourage sysops and users in your region to contribute  to

the Fidonews publisher.  Think of yourself as being a regional  bureau 
chief on the Fidonews editorial staff.

                    NATIONAL COORDINATOR PROCEDURES                     NATIONAL COORDINATOR PROCEDURES 



The   national  coordinator  for  FidoNet  has  the  primary  task  of 
maintaining the master node  list,  as  well  as  the  node  list  for 
region 1.  From  this  are derived several additional responsibilities 
and powers.  However,  these powers are rarely  (if  ever)  used.  The 
                                            ___              national coordinator is very much King Log, not King Stork.  

The  national coordinator,  if he acts at all,  will normally restrict 
himself to negotiating with the parties  involved  in  an  attempt  to 
achieve a peaceful resolution.  

If  a  system  has been dropped from the node list,  and can present a 
sufficiently convincing case to the national coordinator,  then he can 
be granted status as an "independent at large" in region 1.  

In an extreme case,  the national coordinator can order the disbanding 
of a regional net,  or can assign a new coordinator for a region,  but 
                                                        ____           this is highly unlikely.  The national coordinator will only take such 
action  in  an  extreme  situation  which  threatens the existence and 
integrity of FidoNet.  

                                   ________________                    The national coordinator will take no action at all unless  all  other 
means  of  settlement  have  already  been  tried.  His  first step in 
resolving any dispute will be to contact the regional coordinators and 
network hosts involved.  If  they  have  not  been  consulted  by  the 
injured  party  or  otherwise  made  aware of the situation,  then the 
complaint will be dismissed out of hand.  

                                     ________________                  He will also take no action  unless  in  his  opinion  the  matter  is 
serious enough to warrant his attention.  

If  all  means  of  recourse  have been tried to no avail,  and if the 
national coordinator feels that  the  situation  is  grave  enough  to 
warrant  his  intervention,  then  and only then he will intercede and 
take whatever action he feels is appropriate, at his own discretion.

The  world  not  being  perfect,  sometimes  troubles  crop  up.   Any 
organization larger than a cub scout pack needs some sort of grievance 
procedure, and FidoNet is no exception.  

The FidoNet judicial philosophy can be summed up in two rules: 

   Thou shalt not excessively annoy others. 1) Thou shalt not excessively annoy others. 

   Thou shalt not be too easily annoyed. 2) Thou shalt not be too easily annoyed. 

In  other  words,  there  are  no hard and fast rules of conduct,  but 
                                                                  ____ reasonably polite behavior is expected.  Also,  in  any  dispute  both 
sides  are examined,  and action could be taken against either or both 
parties. ("Judge not, lest ye be judged!") 


6.1     Problems with another node 6.1     Problems with another node 

If you are having problems with another node,  you should complain  to 
your  network  host and/or his network host.  If one or both of you is 
not in a net, then complain to the appropriate regional coordinator.  


6.2     Problems with a network host 6.2     Problems with a network host 

If you are having problems with your network host and  feel  that  you 
are not being treated properly, there are a few things you can do.  

The  first  step is to contact your regional coordinator.  If he feels 
that your case has merit, and cannot resolve it in any other way, then 
he may grant you independent status.  You will then  no  longer  be  a 
part of the regional net, and will probably no longer receive Fidonews 
and node list updates, so don't ask unless you are sure you want out.  

If you fail to obtain relief from your regional coordinator,  then you 
can appeal to the national coordinator.  


6.3     Problems with a regional coordinator 6.3     Problems with a regional coordinator 

If you are having problems with your regional  coordinator,  then  you 
should first try to join or form a regional net in your area.  If this 
fails, you can appeal to the national coordinator.  


6.4     Problems with the national coordinator 6.4     Problems with the national coordinator 

If you are having problems with the national coordinator, then you are 
out of luck.  You can either live with it,  drop out and forget it, or 
join with some friends and start another mail system of your own.

6.5     Appeals to the national coordinator 6.5     Appeals to the national coordinator 

If you are unable to obtain relief  from  your  regional  coordinator, 
then  you  can  appeal  to  the national coordinator.  If your case is 
sufficiently extreme and meritorious,  then you may be granted  status 
as an "independent at large" (that is, an independent in region 1, not 
a part of any net or region).  

This is an extreme case, and has never actually come to pass thus far.  
The national coordinator has broad and sweeping powers which he almost 
never  uses.  You  should  be very,  very sure of the strength of your 
case before going this far.  

Also,   the  first  step  taken  by  the   national   coordinator   in 
investigating  any dispute is to contact any regional coordinators and 
network  hosts  concerned.   If  you  have  not  followed  the  proper 
channels,  then  your  case  will  be dismissed out of hand.  In other 
words,  don't go to the national  coordinator  until  you  have  tried 
__________        everything else.

6.6     Case Histories 6.6     Case Histories 

A  few  actual  case  histories of past disputes may be instructive to 
show general procedures and methods.  Names  have  been  left  out  to 
protect the guilty.  


6.6.1   The Case of the Crooked Node 6.6.1   The Case of the Crooked Node 

A  sysop of a local node was using network mail to engage in unethical 
business practices.  His net host became very  annoyed  at  this,  and 
dropped the local from his node list.  

The  local  appealed  to his regional coordinator for assignment as an 
independent node.  The coordinator, on checking with the network host, 
decided  that  the  host  was  within  his  rights  to   be   annoyed.  
Independent status was denied.  

The national coordinator did not intervene.  


6.6.2   The Case of the Hacker Mailer 6.6.2   The Case of the Hacker Mailer 

A  sysop  of a local node made use of file attaches for extra users to 
mail himself the USER.BBS file from several local boards.  The  sysops 
of  these  boards felt annoyed at this,  and appealed to their network 
host.  The host agreed and dropped the offending node  from  the  node 
list.  

The regional coordinator was not consulted.  

The national coordinator did not intervene.  


6.6.3   The Case of the Network Mutiny 6.6.3   The Case of the Network Mutiny 

Several local nodes became annoyed with their network host for failing 
to  provide services.  They complained to their host,  but nothing was 
done.  

They appealed to their regional coordinator,  who  decided  that  they 
were justified in their annoyance and accepted their application for a 
new net number.  

The  national  coordinator  assigned  the  net  number,  based  on the 
regional coordinator's recommendation.

6.6.4   The Case of the Bothered Barker 6.6.4   The Case of the Bothered Barker 

A local node became annoyed with  his  network  host  for  failing  to 
provide  services.  Repeated  complaints  to  his host did not satisfy 
him, so he appealed to the national coordinator.  

The national coordinator,  on seeing that the regional coordinator had 
not been consulted, dismissed the complaint out of hand.  

The  local  node  submitted his complaint to his regional coordinator, 
who investigated the case and discovered that there was  some  justice 
to  the  complaint.  He  advised  and  assisted  the  network  host in 
configuring his system to provide an improved level of service to  the 
local nodes.  

The  regional  coordinator  also decided that the local node was being 
too easily annoyed,  in that he was expecting  services  not  normally 
required  of  a  network  host.  The local node was informed as to the 
true  duties  of  a  network  host,  and  was  advised  to  lower  his 
expectations.  


6.6.5   The Case of the Busy Beaver 6.6.5   The Case of the Busy Beaver 

A  local node which was operated by a retail establishment was engaged 
in making "bombing runs" to mail  advertisements  over  the  net.  His 
network  host  felt  annoyed  and  handling the outgoing traffic for a 
commercial operation, and asked the local node to leave the net.  

The local node applied to the regional coordinator,  and  was  granted 
status as an independent node.  


6.6.6   The Mark of the Devil 6.6.6   The Mark of the Devil 

A  local  sysop whose board was used in conjunction with voodoo rites, 
hacking, phreaking, and obscene material applied to a network host for 
a node number.  The host deemed  that  this  board  was  exceptionally 
annoying, and denied the request.  

The regional coordinator was not consulted.  

The national coordinator dismissed the case out of hand.  


6.6.7   The Case of the Sysop Twit 6.6.7   The Case of the Sysop Twit 

A  patron  of  various  local nodes had been roundly recognized by all 
sysops as a twit.  The user obtained his own system,  became a  sysop, 
and  applied  for a node number.  The network host denied the request.  
No appeals were made.
