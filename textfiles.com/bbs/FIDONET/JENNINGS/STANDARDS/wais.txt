Hi Tom!

I did not see you at the rainbow gathering, did you make it?

I talked with Tim Pozar yesterday and he mentioned you were back in town.

WAIS stuff is going well.  about 10k users in 26 countries; 225 servers in
10 countries; a new db every day.  The technology is starting to look old,
but it is only 1 year old... such is the way of progress.

There is an IBMPC client for using over tcp/ip, but nothing over phones.
See below.

I would love to brainstorm on this.  The possibilities for revolution are
huge.  The big changes are the networks are settling down enough to make
interactive services, and storage capicity of disks is way up.  Togetehr
you can make a publishing system that can make everyone a publisher.

Congrats on the EFF award, you deserve it.

   Hi, long time no etc. !

   Do you have any dox on WAIS that you can gimme? I know you gave me a 
   set once upon a time, vbut I've lost 'em, and I bet they're old 
   anyhoo. I can take .DVI just fine if you can produce them, or else 
   paper copies even... 

   YOu could email to tomj@fidosw.fidonet.org (gated to FidoNet, so no 
   unix compressed stuff), or tomj@kumr.lns.com, ie. Pozar's machine, 
   where I can sz them, or postal ...

   I hope I am not imposing... if so, feel free to correct me at any 
   point!!

   Is there an IBM PC implementation yet?

   I'm trying to formulate near- to far-term plans for local cheap and 
   usable communications using what's generally considered cast of fjunk 
   hardware, as a sort of design baseline. (ANd adjusting upwards as 
   reality dictates :-)
