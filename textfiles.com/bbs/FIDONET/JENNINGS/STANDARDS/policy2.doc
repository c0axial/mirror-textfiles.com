                               OVERVIEW                               OVERVIEW



FidoNet  is  an  amateur electronic mail system.  As such,  all of its
participants and operators are non-paid  volunteers.  From  its  early
beginnings  as a few friends swapping messages back and forth,  it has
now  grown  to  (June  1986)  over  1000  different  systems  on  four
continents.

FidoNet  is  large  enough that it would quickly fall apart of its own
weight unless some sort of structure and control were imposed  on  it.
Multinet  operation  provides the structure.  Decentralized management
provides the control.  This document is an  attempt  to  describe  the
procedures which have been developed to manage the network.


1.1     The Levels of FidoNet1.1     The Levels of FidoNet

With  the  introduction  of  multinet Fido in early 1985,  FidoNet has
developed a hierarchical structure, with the following levels:

o   The  international  coordinatoro   The  international  coordinator;   The  international  coordinator
    compiles all of the  node  lists  from  all  of  the  regions  and
    networks  and  creates  the  master  node  list,   which  is  then
    distributed over the net.

o   The  country  coordinatoro   The  country  coordinator;   In  some  cases   the   International
    coordinator  will appoint a country coordinator to oversee network
    operations  in   a   given   country.   The   exact   duties   and
    responsibilities  of any given country coordinator are assigned by
    the international coordinator, and will not be discussed here.

o   The regional coordinatoro   The regional coordinator;  The regional coordinator maintains  the
    list   of   independent  nodes  in  his  region,   and  encourages
    independents to  join  existing  nets  or  to  form  new  nets.  A
    regional  coordinator  does  not  perform routing services for the
    nodes in his region.

o   The network coordinatoro   The network coordinator;  The network coordinator  is  responsible
    for  maintaining the list of nodes for his net,  and for receiving
    and forwarding any mail coming to the net from outside.

o   The network routing hubo   The network routing hub; Network routing hubs exist only in three-
    tiered  regional  nets.  They  generally  share some or all of the
    duties of the host,  in order to ease the management  of  a  large
    regional  net.  The  exact  duties and procedures are a matter for
    the network coordinator and his hubs to settle,  and will  not  be
    discussed  here.  The network coordinator is still responsible for
    the maintenance of the net.

o   The system operator (sysop)o   The system operator (sysop);  The sysop formulates his own  policy
    for running his board and dealing with his users, so that will not
    be discussed in this document.  However,  the sysop must also mesh
    with the rest of the FidoNet system if he is to send  and  receive
                   ____    mail, and that will be discussed here.

o   The  usero   The  user;  Policy  and  procedures for the individual user on any
    given board is determined by the system operator  of  that  board,
    and will not be considered in this document.

                           SYSOP PROCEDURES                           SYSOP PROCEDURES



A sysop of an individual node can pretty much do  as  he  pleases,  as
long  as  he observes the mail events,  is not excessively annoying to
other nodes on the net,  and does  not  promote  the  distribution  of
pirated copyrighted software.

National  Mail  Hour is the heart of FidoNet,  as this is when network
mail is passed between systems.  Any system which wishes to be a  part
            ____of  FidoNet must be able to receive mail at this time.  A system which
is a member of a regional network may  also  be  required  to  observe
additional mail events, as defined by his network coordinator.

Failure  to  observe  the proper mail events is sufficient grounds for
any node to be dropped from the net without notice  (since  notice  is
generally given by FidoNet mail).

A system which has been  dropped  from  the  network  is  said  to  be
______________excommunicated (i.e.  unable to communicate).  A node which  has  been
excommunicated may or may not be listed for a time in the "dog house",
which is included in the comments at the end of the node list.  If you
find  that  you  have  been excommunicated without warning,  then that
means that your coordinator is  unable  to  contact  you.  You  should
rectify the problem and report back.

National  Mail  Hour  is  observed  from  0900  to 1000 GMT every day,
weekends included.  In each of the  United  States  time  zones,  this
would be as follows:

    Eastern Standard Time         4 AM to 5 AM
    Central Standard Time         3 AM to 4 AM
    Mountain Standard Time        2 AM to 3 AM
    Pacific Standard Time         1 AM to 2 AM
    Hawaii Standard Time         11 PM to Midnight

               ___FidoNet  does  not  observe  daylight  savings  time.  In  areas which
observe daylight savings time  the  FidoNet  mail  schedules  must  be
adjusted  in  the  same direction as the clock change.  Alternatively,
you can simply leave your system on standard time.


2.1     How to get a node number2.1     How to get a node number

You must first obtain a current node list,  so that you can send mail.
You  do not need a node number to send mail,  but you must have one in
order for others to send mail to you.

The first step in obtaining a current node list is to  locate  a  Fido
bulletin  board.  No  help  there;  you're on your own.  Most bulletin
board lists include at least a few Fido systems,  and usually identify
them as such, so this shouldn't be too hard.




FidoNet Policy and Procedures                                  Page 3
If  the  sysop  of any Fido system does not have a node list available
for downloading, then he can probably tell you where to get one.

Once you have a node list,  you must determine which network or region
covers  your  area.   Networks  always  have  a  three  digit  number.
Networks are more restricted in area than regions,  but are  generally
preferred since they provide more services to their members.

If  you  cannot  find a network which covers your area,  then pick the
region which does.  Regions  always  have  a  two  digit  number.  The
United  States is divided into ten regions,  so that you are certainly
in a region even if you are not near a network.

Once you have located the network or  region  in  your  area,  send  a
request for a node number to node zero of that network or region.  The
         ____                                ____request  must  be sent by FidoNet mail,  and must include at least the
following:

    1) Your name.
    2) Your current mailing address.
    3) Your telephone number (voice).
    4) The name of your system.
    5) The city and state where your system is located.
    6) The phone number to be used when calling your system.
    7) Your hours of operation.
    8) The maximum baud rate you can support.

Your coordinator may want  additional  information.  If  so,  he  will
contact you.

Please  allow  at  least  two  weeks  for  a node number request to be
processed.  If you send your request to a regional  coordinator,  then
he may forward your request to the network coordinator who covers your
area (if any), which may take longer.


2.2     If you are going down2.2     If you are going down

If  your  node will be down for an extended period (more than a day or
                                              ___________________two), then you should inform your coordinator as soon as possible.  If
you do not do this,  then other systems will still try  to  reach  you
                                                          __ ___ _____while  you are down,  much to the annoyance of everyone.  Do not under
___  _____________any  circumstances  put an answering machine or similar device on your
phone line while you are down.  If you do,  then calling systems  will
get  the  machine repeatedly,  racking up large phone bills,  which is
____                               Resolution of Disputesvery annoying.  See the section on Resolution of Disputes for  details
on what happens to annoying people.

If your system goes down without warning,  then you may be  placed  in
the dog house, or even removed from the node list completely.

2.3     How to join a network2.3     How to join a network

If you are an independent node and would like to  join  a  network  in
your  area,  you  must  contact  the  network  coordinator.  He can be
reached by sending FidoNet mail to node zero of the network.  He  will
inform  you  of  any special mail schedules and/or routing required by
the network.  Your regional coordinator will contact  you  to  confirm
that  you  wish to join the network.  Once you have been placed in the
network, you will be informed by the network coordinator.

There are many advantages to being in a regional  network.  First  and
foremost is that it helps reduce congestion of FidoNet during National
Mail Hour.  Also, many nets are "outbound" as well as "inbound", which
can  substantially  reduce  your  phone  bills.  In addition,  network
members receive regular updates of the node list and  Fidonews,  while
an independent node may not.


2.4     How to form a network2.4     How to form a network

If there are several nodes in your area, but no regional network, then
you may wish to form your own.  Again,  this has several advantages as
outlined above.

Your first step is to contact the other sysops in your area.  You must
decide which nodes will comprise the network, and which of those nodes
is  going  to be the network coordinator.  Your next step is to inform
your regional coordinator.  You must send him a FidoNet  message  with
the following information:


1) The  region  number(s),  or  network  number(s)  if  a  network  is
   splitting up,  that are affected by the formation of your  network.
   The  regional  coordinator will inform the national coordinator and
   the coordinators of any affected networks that a new network is  in
   formation.

2) The  name that you wish to call your network.  Please try to select
   a  name  that relates to your grouping.  For example,  SoCalNet for
   nodes  in  the   Southern   California   Area   and   MassNet   for
   Massachusettes  Area.  Remember  if  you  call  yourself  DOGNET it
   doesn't help others know what area of the  country  (or  even  what
   country) your group is in.

3) A  copy  of  the  proposed  network's  nodelist.  The nodelist file
   should be named Frrr-nnn.NET  where  rrr  is  the  proposed  host's
   current  region  or  network  number  and  nnn  is his current node
   number.  For example,  if the proposed host is currently listed  as
   node  5  in  region 13,  then you would name the file F013-005.NET.
   This file should be sent attached to the message of application for
   a Network Number.

                    NETWORK COORDINATOR PROCEDURES                    NETWORK COORDINATOR PROCEDURES



A network coordinator has the following responsibilities:

1) To receive incoming mail for nodes in his network,  and to  deliver
   it to its recipients.

2) To assign node numbers to nodes in his network.

3) To maintain the node list for his network, and to send a copy of it
   to the international coordinator whenever it changes.

4) To  pass  along to his nodes new national node lists and new issues
   of FidoNews as they are received.

5) To forward newsletter submissions to the FidoNews publisher.


3.1     Routing inbound mail3.1     Routing inbound mail

It  is  your  responsibility  as  network  coordinator  to receive all
inbound mail for nodes in your  network  and  to  forward  it  to  its
recipients.  You  are  left  to  your own discretion as to how best to
accomplish this.

There are certain exceptions to this,  however.  If  a  node  in  your
network  is  sending  and receiving inordinately large volumes of mail
you can request that he cease and desist.  If he  refuses  to  do  so,
then  you  can  request your regional coordinator to assign the node a
number as an independent and drop him from your node list.

There are two main reasons why a  node  might  generate  exceptionally
large  volumes  of  mail.  Once  in  awhile  a node will try to make a
"bombing run" (sending one message to a great many  nodes).  If  these
are being routed through your outbound host, then you can request that
he cease and desist, on pain of excommunication.  If a node in another
network  is making bombing runs on your nodes and routing them through
your inbound host,  then  you  can  complain  to  the  network  and/or
regional   coordinator  of  the  offending  node.   Bombing  runs  are
considered to be annoying, and may be dealt with accordingly.

The other common source of routing overload is EchoMail.  EchoMail  is
a nice invention,  and offers great benefits, but it cannot be allowed
to degrade the ability of the network hosts to handle  normal  message
traffic.  If  a  node  in  your  network  is  routing large volumes of
EchoMail,  you can ask him to either limit the amount of EchoMail,  or
even  to stop routing his EchoMail completely.  The design of EchoMail
is such that it is a simple matter to do either of these.







FidoNet Policy and Procedures                                  Page 7
3.2     Assigning node numbers3.2     Assigning node numbers

It is your responsibility to assign node numbers to new nodes in  your
network.  You  may  also  change the numbers of existing nodes in your
network,  though you should check with your member nodes before  doing
so.  You  may assign any numbers you wish,  so long as each node has a
unique number within your network.

You should not assign a node number to any system unless and until you
have received a formal request from that system by FidoNet mail.  This
will ensure that the system is at  least  minimally  operational.  The
strict  maintenance of this policy has been one of the great strengths
of FidoNet.


3.3     Maintaining the node list3.3     Maintaining the node list

You should attempt to implement name changes,  phone  number  changes,
etc. in your node list as soon as possible, and to forward the revised
node list to the international coordinator whenever a change occurs.

You should also on occasion send a "broadcast message" to  every  node
in  your network to ensure that they are still operational.  If a node
turns out to be "off the air" with no prior warning given to you, then
you can either mark the node as down,  place it in the dog  house,  or
remove it from the node list completely, at your own discretion.

If a node in your network is acting in a sufficiently annoying manner,
then  you  can  take  whatever  action you deem fit,  according to the
circumstances of the case.


3.4     Passing along node lists and FidoNews3.4     Passing along node lists and FidoNews

As a network coordinator you should from time to time  receive  a  new
issue  of  FidoNews  or an updated node list.  The node list is posted
weekly on Friday, and FidoNews is published weekly on Monday.

You should pass both of these along to your member nodes as soon as is
practical  after you receive them.  It is also desirable that you make
them both available for downloading by the general user,  but this  is
not required.

FidoNews  and  the  node  lists  are  the glue that holds us together.
Without them,  we cease to be a community,  and  become  just  another
bunch of bulletin boards.

3.5     Forwarding newsletter submissions3.5     Forwarding newsletter submissions

The  node  list  gives  us  our  structure,  but FidoNews gives us our
character.  FidoNews is the primary medium by which sysops  hear  from
each  other.  It  is  FidoNews  which  gives  us  the sense of being a
community of people with common interests.

Accordingly,  you should encourage sysops and users in your network to
contribute  to  FidoNews.  If you receive any submissions,  you should
forward them to the FidoNews publisher.  Think of yourself as being  a

                    REGIONAL COORDINATOR PROCEDURES                    REGIONAL COORDINATOR PROCEDURES



A regional coordinator has the following responsibilities:

1) To assign node numbers to independent nodes in his region.

2) To maintain the node list for his region,  and to send a copy of it
   to the international coordinator whenever it changes.

3) To  encourage  independent  nodes  in  his  region to join existing
   networks, or to form new networks.

4) To pass along to inbound hosts in his region new international node
   lists and new issues of FidoNews as they are received.

5) To forward newsletter submissions to the FidoNews publisher.


4.1     Assigning node numbers4.1     Assigning node numbers

It is your responsibility to assign node numbers to new nodes in  your
region.  You  may  also  change  the numbers of existing nodes in your
region, though you should check with the respective nodes before doing
so.  You may assign any numbers you wish,  so long as each node has  a
unique number within your region.

You should not assign a node number to any system unless and until you
have received a formal request from that system by FidoNet mail.  This
will ensure that the system is at  least  minimally  operational.  The
strict  maintenance of this policy has been one of the great strengths
of FidoNet.

If  you  receive  a  node number request from a new node that is in an
area covered by an existing regional network,  then you should forward
the  request  to  the  network  host  instead  of  assigning  a number
yourself.


4.2     Maintaining the node list4.2     Maintaining the node list

You should attempt to implement name changes,  phone  number  changes,
and so forth in your node list as soon as possible, and to forward the
revised  node  list to the international coordinator whenever a change
occurs.

You should also on occasion send a "broadcast message" to  every  node
in  your  region to ensure that they are still operational.  If a node
turns out to be "off the air" with no prior warning given to you, then
you can either mark the node as down,  place it in the dog  house,  or
remove it from the node list completely, at your own discretion.

If  a node in your region is acting in a sufficiently annoying manner,
then you can take whatever action  you  deem  fit,  according  to  the
circumstances of the case.


4.3     Encouraging the formation and growth of networks4.3     Encouraging the formation and growth of networks

One of your main duties as a regional coordinator is  to  promote  the
growth of networks in your region.

You  should try to avoid having independent nodes in your region which
are within the  coverage  area  of  a  regional  network.  There  are,
                                                  ___however,  certain  cases  where  a  node  should  not be a member of a
network,  such as a commercial system with a large volume  of  traffic
which would clog the network.  The resolution of such special cases is
left to your own discretion.

If several independent nodes in your region are in a "clump", then you
should  encourage them to form a regional network.  Refer to the sysop
               forming  a  regional  networkprocedure  on  forming  a  regional  network  for  details   of   what
information you should get.

Note  that  this  does  not mean to encourage the formation of trivial
networks.  Obviously,  one node does not make  a  network.  The  exact
number  of  nodes  required  for  an  effective network must be judged
according to the circumstances of the situation,  and is left to  your
own discretion.


4.4     Passing along node lists and Fidonews4.4     Passing along node lists and Fidonews

As a regional coordinator,  you should from time to time receive a new
issue of FidoNews or an updated node list.  The node  list  is  posted
weekly on Friday, and FidoNews is published weekly on Monday.

You  should  pass  both  of  these  along to any network hosts in your
                                                                   ___region as soon as is practical after you receive  them.  You  are  not
required to mail them to any independent nodes in your region,  though
you may if you wish.  It is also desirable that  you  make  them  both
available  for  downloading  by  the  general  user,  but  this is not
required.


4.5     Forwarding newsletter submissions4.5     Forwarding newsletter submissions

You should encourage sysops and users in your region to contribute  to
FidoNews.  If you receive any submissions,  you should forward them to
the FidoNews publisher.  Think of yourself as being a regional  bureau
chief on the FidoNews editorial staff.

                 INTERNATIONAL COORDINATOR PROCEDURES                 INTERNATIONAL COORDINATOR PROCEDURES



The  international  coordinator  for  FidoNet  has the primary task of
maintaining the master node  list,  as  well  as  the  node  list  for
region 1.  From  this  are derived several additional responsibilities
and powers.  However,  these powers are rarely  (if  ever)  used.  The
                                                 ___international coordinator is very much King Log, not King Stork.

The  international  coordinator,  if  he  acts  at all,  will normally
restrict himself to  negotiating  with  the  parties  involved  in  an
attempt to achieve a peaceful resolution.

If  a  system  has been dropped from the node list,  and can present a
sufficiently convincing case to the international coordinator, then he
can be granted status as an "independent at large" in region 1.

In an extreme  case,  the  international  coordinator  can  order  the
disbanding  of  a regional net,  or can assign a new coordinator for a
region,  but this is highly unlikely.  The  international  coordinator
     ____will only take such action in an extreme situation which threatens the
existence and integrity of FidoNet.

                                           ________________The  international  coordinator  will take no action at all unless all
other means of settlement have already been tried.  His first step  in
resolving any dispute will be to contact the regional coordinators and
network coordinators involved.  If they have not been consulted by the
injured  party  or  otherwise  made  aware of the situation,  then the
complaint will be dismissed out of hand.

                                     ________________He will also take no action  unless  in  his  opinion  the  matter  is
serious enough to warrant his attention.

If all means of recourse have been tried  to  no  avail,  and  if  the
international  coordinator feels that the situation is grave enough to
                                    ____warrant his intervention,  then and only then he  will  intercede  and
take whatever action he feels is appropriate, at his own discretion.

The  world  not  being  perfect,  sometimes  troubles  crop  up.   Any
organization larger than a cub scout pack needs some sort of grievance
procedure, and FidoNet is no exception.

The FidoNet judicial philosophy can be summed up in two rules:

   Thou shalt not excessively annoy others.1) Thou shalt not excessively annoy others.

   Thou shalt not be too easily annoyed.2) Thou shalt not be too easily annoyed.

In  other  words,  there  are  no hard and fast rules of conduct,  but
                                                                  ____reasonably polite behavior is expected.  Also,  in  any  dispute  both
sides  are examined,  and action could be taken against either or both
parties. ("Judge not, lest ye be judged!")


6.1     Problems with another node6.1     Problems with another node

If  you are having problems with another node,  you should complain to
your network coordinator and/or his network  coordinator.  If  one  or
both  of  you  is  not in a network,  then complain to the appropriate
regional coordinator.


6.2     Problems with a network coordinator6.2     Problems with a network coordinator

If you are having problems with your network coordinator and feel that
you are not being treated properly, there are a few things you can do.

The  first  step is to contact your regional coordinator.  If he feels
that your case has merit, and cannot resolve it in any other way, then
he may grant you independent status.  You will then  no  longer  be  a
part  of  the  regional  network,  and will probably no longer receive
FidoNews and node list updates,  so don't ask unless you are sure  you
want out.

If you fail to obtain relief from your regional coordinator,  then you
can appeal to the international coordinator.


6.3     Problems with a regional coordinator6.3     Problems with a regional coordinator

If you are having problems with your regional  coordinator,  then  you
should  first try to join or form a regional network in your area.  If
this fails, you can appeal to the international coordinator.

6.4     Problems with the international coordinator6.4     Problems with the international coordinator

If you are having problems with the  international  coordinator,  then
you are out of luck.  You can either live with it, drop out and forget
it,  or  join  with some friends and start another mail system of your
own.


6.5     Appeals to the international coordinator6.5     Appeals to the international coordinator

If you are unable to obtain relief  from  your  regional  coordinator,
then you can appeal to the international coordinator.  If your case is
sufficiently  extreme and meritorious,  then you may be granted status
as an "independent at large" (that is, an independent in region 1, not
a part of any network or region).

This is an extreme case, and has never actually come to pass thus far.
The international coordinator has broad and sweeping powers  which  he
almost  never uses.  You should be very,  very sure of the strength of
your case before going this far.

Also,  the first  step  taken  by  the  international  coordinator  in
investigating  any dispute is to contact any regional coordinators and
network coordinators concerned.  If you have not followed  the  proper
channels,  then  your  case  will  be dismissed out of hand.  In other
words,  don't go to the international coordinator until you have tried
__________everything else.


6.6     Case Histories6.6     Case Histories

A  few  actual  case  histories of past disputes may be instructive to
show general procedures and methods.  Names  have  been  left  out  to
protect the guilty.


6.6.1   The Case of the Crooked Node6.6.1   The Case of the Crooked Node

A  sysop of a local node was using network mail to engage in unethical
business practices.  His network coordinator became  very  annoyed  at
this, and dropped the local from his node list.

The  local  appealed  to his regional coordinator for assignment as an
independent node.  The regional  coordinator,  on  checking  with  the
network  coordinator,  decided that the network coordinator was within
his rights to be annoyed.  Independent status was denied.

The international coordinator did not intervene.

6.6.2   The Case of the Hacker Mailer6.6.2   The Case of the Hacker Mailer

A sysop of a local node made use of file attaches for extra  users  to
mail  himself the USER.BBS file from several local boards.  The sysops
of these boards felt annoyed at this,  and appealed to  their  network
coordinator,  who  agreed and dropped the offending node from the node
list.

The regional coordinator was not consulted.

The international coordinator did not intervene.


6.6.3   The Case of the Network Mutiny6.6.3   The Case of the Network Mutiny

Several local nodes became annoyed with their network coordinator  for
failing to provide services.  They complained to him,  but nothing was
done.

They appealed to their regional coordinator,  who  decided  that  they
were justified in their annoyance and accepted their application for a
new network number.

The international coordinator assigned the network  number,  based  on
the regional coordinator's recommendation.


6.6.4   The Case of the Bothered Barker6.6.4   The Case of the Bothered Barker

A local node became annoyed with his network coordinator  for  failing
to  provide  services.  Repeated complaints to his network coordinator
did not satisfy him, so he appealed to the international coordinator.

The international coordinator, on seeing that the regional coordinator
had not been consulted, dismissed the complaint out of hand.

The local node submitted his complaint to  his  regional  coordinator,
who  investigated  the case and discovered that there was some justice
to the complaint.  He advised and assisted the network coordinator  in
configuring  his system to provide an improved level of service to the
local nodes.

The regional coordinator also decided that the local  node  was  being
too  easily  annoyed,  in  that he was expecting services not normally
required of a network coordinator.  The local node was informed as  to
the true duties of a network coordinator, and was advised to lower his
expectations.

A  local node which was operated by a retail establishment was engaged
in  making  "bombing  runs"  to mail advertisements over FidoNet.  His
network coordinator felt annoyed and handling the outgoing traffic for
a commercial operation, and asked the local node to leave the network.

The local node applied to the regional coordinator,  and  was  granted
status as an independent node in his region.


6.6.6   The Mark of the Devil6.6.6   The Mark of the Devil

A local sysop whose board was used in conjunction with  voodoo  rites,
hacking,   phreaking,  and  obscene  material  applied  to  a  network
coordinator for a node number.  The network  coordinator  deemed  that
this board was exceptionally annoying, and denied the request.

The regional coordinator was not consulted.

The national coordinator dismissed the case out of hand.


6.6.7   The Case of the Sysop Twit6.6.7   The Case of the Sysop Twit

A  patron  of  various  local nodes had been roundly recognized by all
sysops as a twit.  The user obtained his own system,  became a  sysop,
and  applied  for  a  node number.  The network coordinator denied the
request.  No appeals were made.


6.6.8   The Case of the EchoMail Junkey key key6.6.8   The Case of the EchoMail Junkey key key

A  local  node  became  enamored  with  EchoMail  and  joined  several
conferences,  routing  his outbound mail through his regional network.
He then started an EchoMail conference of his own and  began  relaying
EchoMail  between  several  systems,  again routing it all through his
regional network.

His network coordinator observed that network performance was becoming
seriously impaired.  The offending node was told to hold  it  down.  A
compromise  was  reached  whereby  much of the EchoMail traffic was no
longer routed through the regional network,  and routed  EchoMail  was
limited to twenty messages per night.  No appeals were made.

                    INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MEETINGS                    INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MEETINGS



The  International  FidoNet  Association  (IFNA)   is   a   non-profit
corporation.  As  such,  it  must  from  time  to time hold a business
meeting for the election of officers and for general network business.
These meetings will be held  at  approximately  yearly  intervals,  as
scheduled by the international coordinator.

Every FidoNet system is considered to be a member of IFNA.  Members
are grouped according to their network or region, with each network
and region receiving one vote.

Every  network  and  region  coordinator should attempt to attend each
business meeting.  If it is not possible for a coordinator to  attend,
then  he  should designate a member of his network or region to go and
vote on behalf of the network or region.  Any network or  region  that
does  not have a designated representative present at the meeting will
lose its vote.

Each coordinator  should  send  a  message  by  FidoNet  mail  to  the
international  coordinator  stating  who (if anyone) will be voting on
behalf of the region or network at the meeting.

Any  IFNA  member  who  has  anything  he  would like discussed at the
business meeting  should  send  a  message  by  FidoNet  mail  to  the
international coordinator, who will schedule topics for discussion and
motions to be voted on.
