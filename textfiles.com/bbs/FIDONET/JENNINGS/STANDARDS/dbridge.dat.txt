Tested my system in various compatibility modes against two D'bridge
installations:

	1:2601/506 	d'bridge 1.21
	1:138/120 	d'bridge 1.30


Tested both with Wazoo, all worked fine. Not logged here. 

wazoo yes/no			yes == YOOHOO/2U2 etc
fsc001 no			yes == by-the-book; no 'C' as NAK!
fsc011 no			yes == allows skipfilename

----------------------------------------------------------------
wazoo no
fsc001 no
fsc011 no

Except for 'C' as NAK, worked fine. SEAlink ACK packet data ignored
cuz Fido doesn't do SEAlink.

'C' as NAK on EOT went away? Probably it simpyl ACKed eveything (no errors
or timeouts).

Almost no program passes this (SEAdog, Bink I think)

... Failed because of 'C' as NAK. Fido ignored it, and therefore the block
or EOT didn't get re-sent. (only NAK causes that).

What's happening here is that Fido is a bit over-eager on FSC-0001. It only
sends one TSYNC instead of  TSYNC...wait for response,  before dropping into
XMODEM to send the packet. D'bridge missed or ignored the first TSYNC, and
Fido was in XMODEM and it's all too late ....

This is a screwup on my part, because I have a control:

	multi-tsync yes/no

That is supposed to control that. I am in the middle of moving Fido from
Lattice 2.15 to M'soft C 5.1, so I can't tweak the code right now. But I think
the story is somewhat plain?

Looks to me like D'bridge's XMODEM is AFU, in it's use of 'C' as anything
more than the initial NAK. (Seems to me I remember this from a loooong time
ago...)

The TSYNC thing may screw up other mailers. It "shouldn't" miss the first 
TSYNC, but there's that note at the bottom of page 9 in FSC-0001-9 that sez: 

	"Although the above shows the sender emitting only one 
	TSYNCH, it is reccommended that a timeout of 5-20 seconds 
	should initiate another TSYNCH. The receiver should tolerate 
	multiple TSYNCHs."

I'll tell Mike Bryeans about this, maybe his problem is the TSYNC thing.
He said he had erratic problems. Mine were not erratic, anyways.

It oughta be tested with Bink, Seadog, FrontDoor, etc ...

MY CONCLUSIONS:

-*- 1.30 seems to require more than one TSYNC to get started. 

-*- Both versions don't do a correct XMODEM.

-*- 1.21 seems to do a tolerant SEAlink instead of XMODEM. 1.30 seems to
separate them out, and not do SEAlink when Fido doesn't respond. (Either
works.)
