> I wish to subscribe to FidoNews. Can you put me on your mailing list?

   There is no mailing list for FidoNews. From within FidoNet, you can
   get it from your *C, or by filerequesting (Wazoo only) magicname
   "FIDONEWS".

> Is there an ftp archive site for fidonews?  
 
   Try ftp.ieee.org, in the ~ftp/fidonet/fidonews directory.


   As a last resort, you can always manually download the current 
   FidoNews from the Fido Software / World Power Systems / FidoNews! 
   Bulletin Board, in San Francisco CA, at +1-415-863-2739,
   300/1200/2400/HST.

If you are on the Internet, and have further questions about FidoNet,
send your questions to deitch@gisatl.fidonet.org, who in real life is
David Deitch in Atlanta, Georgia, USofA. A volunteer also, so be nice
and have patience.
