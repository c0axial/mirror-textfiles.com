Oh well, so much for that idea.  It seems that I still can't send you ç
files.

Hah. Got a log fragment on the problem, enclosed. I'd like to identify 
this problem ... to save you ther trouble of groping through the log, 
it all is OK except the 2nd to last *'ed line -- "DIETIFNA: XR2 Bad 
Checksum" (XR2 is FSC-0001, (X)modem (R)eceive state 2.)
 
Fido doesn't do SEALINK, and SEA(dog? Mail?) doesn't do TELINK, so the 
skipfilename happens, and it looks like your end sends the expected 
TELINK block, but Fido gets a checksum error (the TELINK block is 
always checksum remember, even if the rest of the xfer is in CRC... 
aargh) and then carrier is lost. I am fairly certain that its your end 
disconnecting; I presume because Some Thing happened that was 
intolerable, rather than simply one failed try!
 
My end displays more info than gets logged, so if you don't have any 
immediate insight into what's going on (I have no further clues 
without more data), can we arrange for you to send me a file again 
whilst I watch?
 
Or maybe, do you have a self-contained program I can run on my 
hardware here, via FOSSIL, under DESQview, that I can use to test 
with? I swear I will only upload it to two or three BBSs :-)
 
Log frag follows:

31 Jan 92

Here's an annotated log of event sduring your last attempt to fileattach
to me. I'm running Fido/FidoNet 12u. 

Note that the state names are directly from FSC-0001 and other
docs; FR2 is R2 from FSC-0001 (prefixed "F" because the state names
for WAZOO are the same...)

I know where the problem lies, I just don't know what your end is 
expecting. It has to do with TELINK block handling.


(my FIDONET.LOG fragment line begin with "*")

Fido "prefers" Wazoo; it remembers TSYNC, but waits 8 sec more
for a YOOHOO. In this case it honors the TSYNC (ie. FSC-0001)

 * FR2/WVx: Waiting for sync
 * FR2/WV2: Got TSYNC, but trying for YOOHOO
 * FR2/WV2: Got TSYNC, but trying for YOOHOO
 * FR2/WV2: Got TSYNC, but trying for YOOHOO

 * FR2/WV2: Honoring previous TSYNC
 * FR3: Receiving Mail Packet

Fido uses XMODEM CRC or CHECKSUM to receive the packet. Note the
"duplicate 0"; this is the ACK of the SEAlink block. Fido does NOT
support SEAlink.

In a past discussion in FTSC echo, it was left unclear (to me) whether
ACKing the SEALINK block (SOH block 0) is considered "receiver uses SEALINK
protocol", or if that is determined some other way. Fido simply ACKs it
as a "previous block".

 * XMODEM/CRC: INBOUND\3.IN 0
 * XMODEM/CRC: Duplicate 0
 * XMODEM/CRC: Protocol Complete 0
 * FR4: Received 1 packets (128 bytes)

File attach, of course, fails. I believe it has to do with SEALINK vs. 
MODEM7/TELINK. 

There is one thing that puzzles me: Fido gets a TELINK block (SYN), as
noted below in XR1-4. It gets a bad checksum (every time your system calls me)
then your end hangs up on mine. No retries. Is it assuming that if it doesn't
accept a SEALINK block (SOH/0) it *must* accept a TELINK block?

(Note that TELINK blocks are *always* in CHECKSUM, even if the rest
of the transfer is CRC!!!!!! I think this hangs up a lot of people... 
it's been this way since 1981, when the idea was to allow upswitching from
checksum to CRC (as there were Telinks (aka Ptel's) that didn't do CRC ...)

 * FR5: Receiving (possible) attached files
 * DIETIFNA: BR1-2: Got filename 0
 * DIETIFNA: BR1-2: Got filename 0
 * DIETIFNA: BR1-3: Filename skip 0
 * DIETIFNA: XR1-4: TELINK Block 0
 * DIETIFNA: XR2: Bad Checksum 0

This means unexpected carrier loss, ie. CD dropped during a character
read or write.

   (Carrier loss or timeout during packet or file)
 * Total connect time was 0:28

 * Packet from 1:109/0
