You-all have expressed interest in working on freely available
implementations of software that would interface common computers to
ISDN.

It is worth exploring whether you-all are interested in collaborating
on a freely available ISDN protocol implementation in C.  This would
cause the production of ISDN-ready products to explode, and make these
products much more usable because they'd be more highly integrated.
By `freely available', I mean public domain source code, or copyrighted
source code with unlimited, royalty-free distribution permitted (such
as with UC Berkeley software).

Much current work makes ISDN look like a slightly faster modem, with
ISDN protocol processing isolated in an expensive ``modem'' connected
to the computer over a low performance serial port.  High speed ISDN
interfaces will be sitting on a single chip on many computers'
motherboards by the end of the year, and plug-in cards for PC's and
such are already available.  Software that can directly interface to
ISDN and use it for networking, voicemail, high speed fax, eventual
speech recognition, and such would be a vast improvement over the
``modem'' model.

I know that Tom and Ted have the technical skills needed to work on
the project (perhaps John Reilly too -- we haven't met).  What we lack
is funding and a clear direction.  Tom has been doing some consulting
with Saskatchewan Tel on hooking up Hayes ISDN modems to IBM PC's.
Mitch is `marketing' and proselytizing to a variety of companies
(including telcos) about funding ISDN and accelerating its spread.
Among us all, it should be possible to connect these people and ideas
and funds into something that will quickly bring ISDN into every
product and research project that can use it.  Are you interested?

        John Gilmore

PS:  My own company has discovered that it's not hard to make money
providing support and improvements to a free product -- after it
has been written and has gotten into active use in many companies.

I don't know of any PD software for handling ISDN call setup and teardown.
I have heard that it is very hairy and complicated software, too.

The latest twist is to have "ISDN modems" which do the call setup and
teardown for you, using "AT" commands.  There is a draft standard for this.
DC Hayes has been working hard on this stuff, and you can contact their
ISDN office in San Francisco at +1 415 974 5544.  Try talking to Bill ç
Taylor,
though he will try to charge you $125 for the specs.  Tell him what he's
full of and see if you can get the standards committee contact name ç
instead.

Mitch, one thing to pitch as you talk to ISDN vendors and suppliers,
would be that a free implementation in source code would greatly
expand the market for ISDN over the next few years, just as the free
implementation of TCP/IP in Berkeley Unix (work funded by DARPA)
resulted in an explosion of high quality TCP/IP implementations.
Either a vendor could release their source code, or some telco
(perhaps BellCore?) might be willing to fund the writing of a free
one.

   I would love to work on this project.  

   About a year to two years ago, I was looking into using ISDN for
passing IP to/from The Little Garden to/from me.  I lined up the boxes
from Hayes (Hayes' development for ISDN is here in SF) and was stopped
when I found that the local CO would not be supporting ISDN for at least
three years down the line.  (They kept suggesting that I move my "office"
to an area where PacBell has ISDN support.)  

  (Hmmm, this message has prompted me to give a call to my ISDN contact at
   PacBell and see what the status is on the COs in SF is.  I will follow ç
up
   to this list.)

   If I can get ISDN here at home, with hopefully some one else I can bang
the boxes against (e.g. TJ) I would make the project one of my higher
prioity projects.  Its up to the PacBell gods as when the CO will be
supporting ISDN.

      Tim

I think ISDN is available in San Francisco now.   PacBell upgraded the
CO software in Palo Alto just before the ISDN release came out, and
they don't like to upgrade COs very often, so Palo Alto is pretty much
the only place in Silly Valley that doesn't have ISDN and won't have
it in the near future.   Mountain View, where I work, has ISDN, and so
does Sunnyvale, where I'm hoping to move soon.   Even La Honda (my
current home) should have it by the end of 1992.

The only catch is that it's not tariffed for single line use yet -
you have to buy a Centrex, with a minimum of two lines.   The total
setup cost is around $900 for the Centrex and the two lines; the cost
per month is about $25 per line, for a total of $50.   The PacBell rep
that I've been dealing with thinks that the new tariff may be out this
year, but didn't want to make any promises...

I am definitely interested!   I already have hardware for the project
donated by DEC; I still need to finish making BSD work on it, but
that's mostly done.   This is a description that I've written up about
what I want to do with ISDN (This is part of an addendum to my
employee agreement at NCD):

    It is my intention, once I have  4.4BSD working reliably  on
    my home machine,  to implement  an ISDN driver  for the ISDN
    port  which is  built  in to the  machine.  This driver will
    allow a user to make both digital and audio connections over
    ISDN to  other  ISDN connections  and,  in the case of audio
    connections, to non-ISDN telephones.

    The software will  also be  able  to answer  incoming  audio
    calls, play a message, record a message, and handle commands
    entered in to an  audio phone via  DTMF (Touch Tone).  Since
    the ISDN connection being supported is a 2B+D connection, it
    will be  possible to perform any of  the functions mentioned
    above on two seperate channels.

    The software  may further be able  to perform such functions
    as remote  caller  identification,  which  may  be  used  to
    trigger different responses depending on the identity of the
    calling   station;   possible  responses  include  selective
    forwarding, selective voice mail, and selective presentation
    of incoming calls for answering by a human.  This  will most
    likely be  accomplished through the use of a shell script or
    shell scripts  which are  passed the caller's identification
    on the  command line; thus,  any sort of action which can be
    taken  by the system can be selectively triggered  based  on
    the ID of an incoming call.

What I didn't mention is that I want to run IP over the digital
connection - a 64kilobaud single-streaming modem isn't very useful.

My main obstacles right now are that I don't have access to a standards
document telling me what protocol to speak, and that I don't have a test
bed - you're not allowed to test your software on the network; you have
to get it certified at PacBell first.   PacBell seems eager to help
stimulate development, though, so I'm hoping that they'll give me access
to their test equipment from time to time during implementation.

Needless to say, there's a lot of work to be done here, so I'd rather
have other people working with me on it!

EFF would be interested in (1) serving as a principal FTP site for such a
project, and (2) "marketing" and promoting it.  We'd also be able to serve
as a test site for the software, as we expect to have ISDN linking our
office to staff members' homes soon.

   This was confirmed by a PacBell employee this last Friday.  You need
Centrex to get ISDN and you need to get at least two loops.

This is a great idea.  I guess the ISDN TA's from Hayes can't do it.
You need a real ISDN interface (that hands you all the bits) so you can
reinterpret it to analog and then decode it like a modem.  But it's
a great hack if you have a DSP handy (or can route the ISDN audio into
a modem chip).

Dear All,
        I have been considering 'evolution' and the introduction
of an ISDN service. Clearly, many users are presently using modems,
others will start using ISDN by means of V110 (etc) terminal adaptors.

        I believe that it will prove useful to accept calls
from each of the above situations on an ISDN interface that can also
accept all the link level protocols being addressed in the MLP
discussions.

        What does this imply? Well, all the old modem standards
only generate 'voice style' frequencies on the wire. Thus, if
the modem call starts on an analogue network, it should be able
to call into the ISDN network where it will be specifying
a 'voice' capable channel. It is clearly possible that if
we accepted the byte stream, we could, in software, recreate
the original bit stream that entered the modem. Similarly
(and more easily) we can clearly handle V110 in software too.

Why do I wish to do this? Simply I wish
to establish an 'evolution strategy' I want to be able to make all my
new investment in ISDN, but still be able to support 'home'
and other remote users who have modems or who buy TAs
without having to buy them all new ISDN cards too.....
I really dont want lots of modem racks at the central end either....
In fact we dont have many modem lines at the moment, but there is
strong pressure to provide more dialup access.
Some users (research staff, lecturers..)
may indeed be able to afford ISDN cards for their PCs or
workstations but the 'students' and others may not.
It seems silly to invest in both more analogue lines and modems
on site as well as new ISDN lines and interfaces too.

So, what do people think? Does anyone have code to interpret
modem or TA generated traffic in software? Do you all
think this is rubbish?

Of course, if we accept the above, we may find us decoding
modem or TA traffic, finding it contains 'SLIP' or 'PPP' and then dealing
with that too.....

Bye for now,....
Dave Price
