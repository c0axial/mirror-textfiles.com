* How Did This Happen?
Tom Jennings 1:125/111

Let's keep this simple: at no time have the sysops of our FidoNetç
network given /0's the privilege of determining how our networkç
is run. They are not representatives of anyone but themselves;ç
they are merely administrative nodes to generate nodelistç
fragments, help new sysops get online and act as repositories ofç
the necessary network files. They are ordinary nodes with moreç
work to do.

A dangerous thing has been attempted, and is undermining theç
trust that we rely on. "POLICY4" is simply not in effect, it wasç
not voted upon by the members at large. I, and many many others,ç
are simply ignoring the supposed policy "change". How did thisç
happen?

POLICY4 is terrible policy. It takes the right to choose your ownç
net host way! It entrenches /0's as positions of authority. Thisç
is insane and does not facilitate our communications. A "smoothlyç
running network" is not our goal; we are here to communicate,ç
that is all. We do that well now. Even voting on POLICY4 isç
insane, it certainly will not benefit the 6000 or so sysops inç
the network!

I've had FidoNet users tell me that their host doesn't auto-
matically route them their host-routed mail. This was the most
basic purpose of a net host to begin with! The whole concept of
host-routing was to make FidoNet more effecient by concentrating
calls!

Anyways, If a few-dozen or -hundred /0's can vote, then a 
few-thousand can represent themselves just as simply. So what 
if it takes a long time, expediency is not a goal. If we don't 
have the tool(s), write them or do it by hand. Freeze a nodelist
as the "list of registered voters". Have everyone send in a 
message. Check them off the list. Hold redundant votes, compare 
results. Give it a month. The net runs fine, there is no need to 
implement bad policy just to satisfy some bureaucratic urge!
