Subj: SEAdog Reply to Fido V12 Message

CC:Tom Jennings,John Hamilton 

I think their may be a compatibilty problem with SEAdog replying to a message 
generated by Fido V12. The first time it happened I thought it was a fluke. 
But this is the second or third time that TJ has sent me direct netmail and 
when I responded it tried to send the response back to 1:1/1 FidoNews. The 
extended address on the message is INTL 1:100/22 1:125/111. I wonder if 
somehow the 1:1(25)/1(11) the tens and hundreds digits are not being read by 
SEAdog on Fido V12 generated messages. The "From:" displays properly but the 
reply "To:" address (1:1/1) is sure wrong.  Would you guys mind sending a few 
messages back and forth to each other and see if you encounter the same 
problem.  

Thanks, - Ken -

Fido 12 appears to be putting in an interzone address, even when the message 
is going to someone else in your zone.  When SEAdog does a reply, it does not 
check to see if the interzone address on the message to which you are 
replying is from another zone (assuming that it is), and hence routes to the 
"zone 1 to zone 1 gateway", or 1/1.  

Bit of an oversight on both our parts.

Yeah ... the problem is that the INTL line is not documented. Oh well. I 
think I've followed the letter & the spirit of the law as far as it goes: the 
INTL line is the messages "full address", and integral part of messages since 
day #1. In order for file attaches & zone gating to work, I hav to have 
access to the full address at all times; and the INTL line provides this. 
First Fido generates the messages addresses from the header, then completes 
it from the IFNA Kludge if it exists.
 
The kludges presence shouldnt hurt anything; at worst, its redundant. Also, 
its existence speeds up searching to see if there is one; if there is, the 
search stops!
 
Is it possible for you to atoi() the dest zone number, and ignore it if 
intrazone?
