Subject: Email privacy case settled                                        

The long running Alcor/email case against the County and City of Riverside, 
CA was settled out of court in April of this year.  The announcement was 
delayed until all parties had signed off, and the check (for $30k) had 
cleared the bank :-). 

The Alcor Life Extension Foundation (a non-profit cryonics organization 
--alcor@cup.portal.com) ran a BBS for members and prospective members from 
early 1987 through January 12, 1988.  On that day, the BBS computer was 
removed under a warrant to take the computer (but no mention of any 
contained email) in connection with the investigation into the death of 
83-year-old Dora Kent.  (Mrs. Kent was placed into cryonic suspension by 
Alcor in December of 1987.   During and following the investigation, Alcor 
staff members were publicly accused by county officials of murder, theft, 
and building code violations.  No charges were ever filed and the 
investigation was officially closed three years later.) 

In December of 1988 Keith Henson filed a civil suit to force an 
investigation of the apparent violations of the Electronic Communication 
Privacy Act by the FBI, but the case was dismissed by the now convicted 
Judge Aguilar. 

In early 1990, just before the statute of limitations ran out, Henson and 
14 others (of the roughly 50 people who had email on the system) filed a 
civil action against a number of officials and the County and City of 
Riverside, CA under Section 2707 of the Electronic Communication Privacy 
Act.  

Some time after the case was filed, the Electronic Frontier Foundation came 
into existence in response to law enforcement abuses involving a wide 
spectrum of the online community.  EFF considered this case an important 
one, and helped the plaintiffs in the case by locating pro bono legal help.  
While the case was being transferred, the County and City offered a 
settlement which was close to the maximum damages which could have been 
obtained at trial.  Although no precedent was set because the case did not 
go to trial, considerable legal research has been done, and one judgment 
issued in response to the Defendants' Motion to Dismiss.  The legal filings 
and the responses they generated from the law firm representing the 
County/City and officials are available by email from mnemonic@eff.org or 
(with delay) from hkhenson@cup.portal.com.  (They are also posted on 
Portal.) 
 
The Plaintiffs were represented by Christopher Ashworth of Garfield, 
Tepper, Ashworth and Epstein in Los Angeles (408-277-1981).  A summary of 
the settlement agreement is attached.

ALCOR FILES SUIT OVER ELECTRONIC MAIL SEIZURE 
 
By David Bloom, The Press-Enterprise 
 
   Another legal battle has erupted between Alcor Life Extension 
Foundation  and the law, this time with a federal lawsuit filed by 
Alcor over the seizure more than two years ago of computerized 
"electronic mail" during a search of the group`s Riverside 
headquarters. 
 
   Alcor members pay up to $100,000 for the privilege of have their 
bodies put in cryonic suspension, frozen at temperatures hundreds of 
degrees below zero, after their death.  The members hope developing 
medical technology will one day enable the to be revived and cured. 
 
  The group ran afoul of local law enforcement officials, however, 
after the  cryonic suspension of the head of Dora Kent in December 
1987. 
 
   The Riverside County coroner's Office accused Alcor members of 
hastening along Kent's death with a lethal dose of barbiturates in 
preparation for freezing.  The group has denied the accusation, saying 
the provided only "care and comfort" to the 83 year-old Kent in her 
last two days. 
 
   Law enforcement officers raided the Alcor headquarters on 
Riverside's southwest edge in January 1988, searching for computer 
equipment, software and related material, and for Kent's body parts, 
and any illegal drugs. 
 
   They found the equipment, but not Kent, whose head had been 
secreted away, or any illegal drugs. 
 
   The most recent lawsuit was filed last month in U.S. District court 
in Los Angeles.  It accuses a dozen Riverside City and County law 
enforcement officials of violating the Electronic Communication 
Privacy Act of 1986. 
 
   The suit says police illegally seized the electronic mail of 14 
Alcor members when it seized the computer equipment.  A copy of the 
search warrant included as an exhibit in the suit does not mention 
electronic mail. 

   The suit asked for at least $10,000 for each of the alcor member who 
filed the suit.  Most to the same members filed a claim against the 
city 11 months ago, but the city allowed the claim to expire without 
response after 45 days, said  attorney John Porter, who is 
representing the city and two policemen named in  the suit. 
 
   "This lawsuit was filed in federal court," Porter said.  "It 
should have been filed the Twilight Zone." 
 
    The attorney for Alcor could not be reach for comment late 
    yesterday.

and DOES 1 through 100 inclusive,
               Defendants.

          Plaintiffs complain of defendants as follows:
                       JURISDICTIONAL ALLEGATION

          1.   This case arises under an Act of Congress, namely
the Electronic Communication Privacy Act of 1986; U.S.C. Section
2701, et Seq., and in particular, the civil enforcement
Provisions thereof, 18 U.S.C. Section 2707.   Venue is proper in this
Court in that all of the defendants reside in this district.

                   COMMON ALLEGATIONS

           2.    Plaintiffs are all individuals residing in 
various point and places in the United States.  [except Brian
Wowk who resides in Canada.]
          3.   Defendants Carillo, Hill, Cupido, Kuntzman,
Worthington, Bogan, Schmalz, Trask, Spitzer, Hinman and Mosley
are all employees of defendant County of Riverside, and at all
times material, were acting within the course and scope of their 
employment.  Defendants Richardson and Portillo are all 
employees of defendant City of Riverside and at all times
material, were acting within the course and scope of their
employment.  Defendant County of Riverside ["county'] is a
political subdivision of the State of California.  Defendant
City of Riverside ["city'] is a municipal entity located within
California.
          Defendants Carillo, Hill, Cupido, Kuntzman,
Worthington, Bogan, and Schmalz are employed by defendant County
in the Office of the Riverside County Coroner.  Defendants
Trask, Spitzer, Hinman and Mosley are employed by the said
county in the office of the District Attorney,  Defendants
Richardson and Portillo are employed by defendant City in the
Riverside Police Department.

-------------------

          4.   All of the events complained of herein occurred
within two years of the date of filing of the complaint.
               At all times material, Alcor Life Extension
Foundation, a non-Profit corporation with its principal place of
business in Riverside County, maintained facilities at its place
of business whose purpose was to (in part) facilitate the 
sending and receipt of electronic mail ["E-mail"] via computer-
driven modems and which electronic mail facility was utilized by
the plaintiffs, and each of them.  The Alcor Facility is remote in
geographical location from all plaintiffs.
          5.   At all times material, each plaintiff had one or
more E-mail messages abiding on electron or magnetic medial at
the Alcor facility.  Prior to [actually on] January 12, 1988, defendants 
procured from the Riverside Superior Court a search warrant
which authorized, in general, a search of the facilities of
Alcor.  A true and correct copy of that search warrant is 
attached hereto and marked Exhibit "A".  The search warrant does
not purport to reach, nor was it intended to reach, any of the
E-mail of plaintiffs.
          6.   On January 12, 1988, defendant entered upon the
Alcor premisses and removed many things therefrom including the
electronic media containing plaintiffs' E-mail.
          7.   Contemporaneously with the seizure of the 
electronic media containing plaintiffs' E-mail, defendants were
explicitly informed that they were seizing plaintiffs' E-mail
which was not described either generally or specifically in the
warrant hereinabove referred to.

--------------

          8.   No notice was given to any plaintiff by any
defendant of the impending seizure of their E-mail.
          9.   In the process of procuring the warrant, neither
the defendants nor anyone else made any showing that there
was reason to believe that the contents of any of plaintiffs' E-
mail was relevant to any law enforcement inquiry.
          10.   Subsequent to the execution of the warrant on
January 12, 1988, no notice was given to any plaintiff by any
government entity, including the defendants, nor any
defendant herein, at any time, regarding the defendants 
acquisition and retention of plaintiffs' E-mail.
          11.   The court issuing the warrant in respect of the
Alcor facility did not, prior to the issuance of the warrant nor
at any other time, determine that notice to plaintiffs
compromised any legitimate investigation within the meaning of 18
U.S.C.  section 2705(a)(2).
          12.   Not withstanding that defendant and each of them
were informed that they had taken, along with materials
describe in the warrant, E-mall belonging to plaintiffs, said
defendants knowingly and willfully (a) continued to access the
electronic and magnetic media containing plaintiffs' E-mail and
(b) continued to deny access to plaintiffs to such E-mail for
many months although a demand was made for the return of the
said E-mail.  Defendants' wrongful access to and retention of
plaintiffs' E-mail was intentional within the meaning of 18
U.S.C. section 2707.

--------------

          13.   Proximately caused by the unprivileged actions of
the defendants hereinbefore described, each plaintiff has
suffered damage in an amount to be proved at trial, but in no
event less than $10,000 each.
          WHEREFORE plaintiffs pray:
        1.   For damages according to proof;
        2.   For cost of suit;
        3.   For Attorneys' fees pursuant to 18 U.S.C.
section 2707(b)(3);  and
        4.   For such other and further relief as is required
in the circumstances.
