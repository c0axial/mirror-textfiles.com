Fido was originally the name of a computer I had in the lateç
70's. I was working for a friend's consulting company (Microft Inc,ç
Falmouth MA) and we were using my computer, which was in a four footç
high rack: 18 slot chassis with 14 cards (4MHz Z80, CPU 64K memory,ç
bootstrap ROM card (six cards so far\dots), 8" floppy ,DC-300 tapeç
drive, and a BASF 6172 8-inch Winchester tape drive which was as fastç
as it was unreliable. (It had a progressive and degenerative diseaseç
we called "the whoops"; the voice-coil head positioner make theç
customary chirping sounds; the BASF's favorite failure mode was toç
lose track of where it's head was at (quite literally) and instead ofç
the familiar chirping sounds as it seeked up and down the disk, itç
made a sort of whooping sound, like a falling siren, followed by aç
KLUNK as the positioner hit it's backstop. You had to power it down toç
reset it. Most annoying.) The rear door was a rack of fans to keep itç
all cool. It was extremely large and complex, and when it ran (most ofç
the time) quite powerful. It ran PDOS (a rather nice CP/M-80ç
compatible OS) and we did "C" (BDS and Whitesmiths) and assembly workç
on it.

It had so many parts\dots{} I called it a mongrel. I had taken toç
calling it "Fido". Debbie took a business card, whited-out the nameç
and wrote in "Fido, Office Computer".

The name stuck.
