Hiya Tom, I managed fall a little behind in reading the weekly fidonews, ç
but after catching up and noticing your call for "old-stuff" I couln't ç
resist shooting off a message to you.

I have a couple of oldies but goodies attached (fidohist and struct2). You ç
may have already received them from someone else, but what the hell.  I ç
EVEN still have a copy of 2 versions of minitel!  Want 'em? I'd be MORE ç
than happy to ship 'em to ya -- just let me know. Look ma! No stamps!

Pardon me while I walk down memory lane in your mail-box. :)

I remember using these two programs for quite a while.  I loved them -- ç
mostly for their simplicity.  I think they were also a partial motivator ç
for me to teach myself C.  The phone book lookup was great and to date I ç
still don't know of a (strictly) telecommunications program that uses ç
anything like it.  I'm refering to the string search.

I remember using Fido v7m (I think that was it).  I had just started ç
getting interested in modeming (is that a verb?) using RBBS and stumbled ç
upon this funky program called Fido.  I couldn't resist running it.  It ç
was so -- different from the other (few) BBS's out there.  I immediately ç
applied to you for a node number -- node 52 it was.  I think node 51 ç
belonged to one of the guys in St.Louis!  Wasn't it Ken Kaplin -- or was ç
that Ben Baker?

Tom its all your fault!  I blame you for getting me hooked on BBSing and ç
being involved with the network in my corner of the world from that point ç
on.  Its all your fault -- and I can't thank you enough. :)

Let me know if ya want those 2 versions of minitel and I'll send 'em right ç
away.

BTW, any news on the video cassettes of FidoCon?  (Flashback!  I remember ç
seeing a single column article in SOME rag that had your picture in it.)  ç
Sorry, I didn't keep that one. :)

Anyway, I've always wanted to see the faces behind the messages.  I'd love ç
to go some year.  Maybe FidoCon can be held in Vegas some year, or better ç
yet here in southern california!

Gary...
