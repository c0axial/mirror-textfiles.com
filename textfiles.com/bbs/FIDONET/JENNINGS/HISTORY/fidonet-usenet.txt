    The information that appeared here on Allnet was a bit misleading.
Yes, they have six-second billing, but they also have a 1-minute
minimum.  They also charge more for the first minute than they do
for subsequent minutes.  Their salesman told me that they don't bill
for calls under 1 minute at all, but they same salesman told me that
the first minute was NOT loaded, which turned out not to be true.
(I haven't gotten a bill yet, so I don't know about not billing
under 1 minute - I'll report back - my FIDOnet system should give
*that* a good test...).

The following "ad" was posted to one of my FIDO systems, and I thought
the population of the USENET might be interested.  You can respond to
the ad directly, or to me at ..!seismo!hadron!klr, and I will send them
along to Larry via FIDO:

----------------------------[ Clip here ]-------------------------------

Attention Star Trek Fans:

I have a collection of authentic Star Trek Film Clips for sale.
These are original clips rescued from the cutting room floor by
Lincoln Enterprises.  I have about 120 different clips, each 
one to four frames long.  Most shots are of the Enterprise crew 
and guest stars.  They can be mounted in half-frame slide 
mounts for projection.  This is as close as you'll ever come to
owning a real piece of Star Trek.
Prices:   all 120 clips for $75.00
       or a random sampling of 10 clips for $10.00

Re:   MSDOS Technical BBS

     There is a generic MSDOS oriented BBS in Sanfrancisco: Fido: 
(415)-864-1418 - 1200/300 baud 24 hrs.  The usual msg base, file up and 
download via XMODEM, MODEM batch mode, extended TELINK mode.  10 Mb 
space, about 2 M files.  Trying to keep mostly generic MSDOS utils and 
sources; about 75:25 Generic:PC.  BBS software is new (not in BASIC) 
and is available for FREE for downloading.  No time limits, etc (yet!) 
CP/M software is OK too; not too much there yet, except some stuff for 
BDS (Unix file i/o system, utilities).  Mostly C and assembly; only one 
(1) program in basic.
