                             FidoNet 
              The First BBS Electronic Mail System
                          by Tony Clark

FidoNet  is  one  of the most interesting features  of  the  Fido 
Bulletin Board System.  Tom Jennings,  the author of the Fido BBS 
and  FidoNet network has created a sophisticated yet easy to  use 
electronic mail system.  Simply stated the FidoNet network allows 
users on one BBS to send and receive messages from users of other 
BBSes located anywhere in the world!

It works like this. You call your local Fido bulletin board, log-
on  and go to the FidoNet message area.  You enter a message,  as 
you normally would in any other message area except that you  are 
asked  for  the Fido system or systems that you want to send  the 
message  to.  Next  you enter your message and  terminate  it  as 
usual.  Later that night,  the Fido BBS shuts down according to a 
prearranged schedule and begins processing mail.  Processing mail 
consists  of  assembling packets,  dialing the phone  number  and 
transmitting  the data to another Fido BBS.  At the same time the 
local Fido `listens' for incomming mail messages.  At the end  of 
the  mail  period  FidoNet returns controll to the Fido  BBS  and 
allows users to log-on again.

All well and good,  you say but what can I do with this? Well for 
starters Fido can send messages to over 100 other FidoNet systems 
nationwide.  All  you do is enter a single message and a list  of 
the  nodes  that  you  want it  sent  to  and  presto!  You  have 
communicated  with  large  number of BBS  users  with  relativley 
little  effort.  Secondly,  FidoNet  can do this in a  very  cost 
effective  manner.  The cost for a user to call each BBS,  log on 
and enter the message prohibits many users from doing  this.  The 
cost  of sending a FidoNet message is controlled by the sysop and 
usually ranges from 0 to 25 cents per message. Far cheaper than a 
single  phone  call  to an out of state  BBS.  Also  FidoNet  can 
operate  at 1200 baud,  so if you are using a 300 baud modem  you 
have  decreased  your connect time by a factor  of  four.  Lastly 
FidoNet  has  the  capability of transmitting files  as  well  as 
messages. Now you can distribute the latest copy of your favorite 
program to other users all across the United States.

To  sum  it up,  FidoNet allows you to reach out and  communicate 
with  a large number of computer users at a reasonable  cost.  In 
many  cases the cost of sending a message is free!  So  the  next 
time  you  have a peculiar problem that you can't seem to get  an 
answer to,  or you are looking for a particular file to help  you 
perform  some  difficult task,  send a message to  several  other 
Fido BBSes via FidoNet mail.  I am sure that you will be suprised 
and pleased with the results.
