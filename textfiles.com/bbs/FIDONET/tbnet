Introducing... THE Thunderbolt Net.


 Put in a few words, The Thunderbolt Net main objectives are to introduce 
 new ideas regarding BbSing (so far we have come up with 'The Court Room'
 and a BbS developped family feud game).
 Another goal is to launch a myriad of Interbbs games (currently running 
 BRE, ISA, almost set: Chess Magic and TW2.  More to come. Complete help and
 guides to setup those games as interbbs are available from here by yours
 truly, step by step setups/manuals). 
 And finally, to be a file network where authors, artists and programmers 
 can easiliy distribute, provide easy registration and support for their 
 products.
 
 The way things are going we should hopefully be one of the biggest 
 alternative network in the near future.

 A few things you should know is that most echoes allow Handles in them,
 if you don't mind mixing handles/real names, then there is no problems.
 You can join only one aspect of the net if you are not interested in the 
 other (ie: only Interbbs games, but no files.. or vice versa etc...)
 
 This is more of an alternative/wicked/relaxed network, with a couple rulez
 to keep things going but no fricken 2 megs worth of policy BS (Hints to...).


In Brief the net is divided in 3 main parts:


                         ﬁ‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹›
                         ﬁ      Echoes      ›
                         ﬁ‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹›

   - Software Talk Echoes
   - University Echoes
   - General Echoes
   - Files Distributions : Local Authors programs/mods/Arts etc..

                         ﬁ  InterBBS Games  ›
                         ﬁ‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹›

The main game running right now is Barren Realms Elite [BRE]
There is around 20 active boards so far in the league.. including a couple 
LD HUBs in London and Ohio.  It's a pretty challenging league and it gets 
very interesting and tense in there... If you think you are up to the
challenge, come on out and join in the fun.

I also wrote a text file with step by step instructions on how to setup BRE
for InterBBS use if you need it (Filed attached).

We have an ISA game going on and we are testing Dwarz and TW2 for 
Interbbs use.

These leagues are free and open to all.  

Hope to hear from you soon...

Ok, the court idea is basically, you got a grudge against someone ? someone
pisses you off or you just hate some guys/girls guts?  don't hunt them down
and
barbecue them, TAKE THEM TO COURT! .. and all you have to do is accuse them
of
something and convince the members of the jury that they are guilty of so..
and
the guy will get a punishment decided and approved by the judge.. and you get
federal protection just in case the guys family wants to retaliate :)...  BUT
<--
gotta have a butt... if you can't prove that the guy is guilty and the drunk
judge rules that he is innocent, you will be charged for wasting the totally
worthless time of the jury with completely useless hirings.. (tsik tsik)...

So may the wisdom be yours and ACCUSE someone, just for the heck of it...
anyone, just pick a guy on the last 5 callers list on the board you just
logged
on and light a fire up his ass...

Cya laid-her..
 

 
 Now guys, the keywords  are :
 
 TBnet = (The COURT room * InterBbS kick ass games) + Distros 

   Hence =>  TBnet = (e^FUN - 1) exp10 ==>  it all boils down to....
