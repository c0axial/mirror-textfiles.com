081293                     ITCnet Route Map

This is the proper routing setup for ITCnet. It is not cast in stone!
But should be adheared to as closely as possible. And as all policies are...
this is also subject to change as the need arises.

As far as the Areas.bbs file (or *.ctl file) that you use to do the mail with
I would suggest that you print out the nodelist and use it as a guide to find
the nodes that fall under your state or hubs. And remeber the place that you
receive your mail from is always the very first node number in the areas.bbs
file. If you use Qmail or Tosscan see your particular documentation.

If you have any improvements or ideas please submit via netmail to 85:85/1

Thank you,
Jack Reece

PS...A numberical break down would be like this......in reverse order from
node level up to Zone Echo Coordinator.


85:805/286 will poll--->85:805/200 in turn will poll--->85:805/1 and the

will poll 85:10/0       (REC=Regional Echo Coordinator)

85:805/286--->85:805/200--->85:805/1--->85:10/0---->\
 (Node) -----> (Hub) ------> (Host) ---> (REC)      \|/
                                                    \|/
85:805/286<--- 85:805/200<--- 85:805/1<--- 85:10/0<-/

For some of you that really don't understand...its like going up to the top
of a hill....then you must go back down the hill.........

  Routing:
        All Routing is to be done through your Local Host/Hub, this includes
        all Echos/Netmail. File Requests should be sent directly.
        This will aid in cutting down traffic in both local and LD
        mail.  Hubs, if you are having a problem with this, please let
        me know, and I'll aid you in setting this up.  Also, all systems
        MUST scan your Mail Host/Hub as 85:xxx/x, at least 3 times/week.
        Where 85:xxx/x the xxx/x stands for your Host/Hub that you receive
        your mail. for example 85:865/0 is a Host. 85:865/1 is a Hub.
        85:865/101 is not, it is a normal hub and should not be feeding anyone.
        Even though both numbers 865/1 and 865/101 could be the same system.
        Only 865/1 is a echo/mail hub number. See example in the
        Routpoll.map file.
        So you can look up the proper number in the enclosed nodelist. called
        called ITCLIST.xxx (xxx being the version number)
        This is extremely important..if you use the wrong number in the
        Areas.bbs or Ctl file or as an aka it will create netmail on the other
        persons system. Or lots of BAD_MSGS...Be careful of the numbers you
        use...
        See the actual nodelist below for Host/Hub to Poll from. Thanks!

  ITCnet currently based upon two Major Zones/Regions East and West.

              Listed below are the Major Zones/Regions

         Pacific Time Zone  = 85:85/1     (The ITCnet BBS)
         Eastern Time Zone  =

   This is turn is broken down into the following Regional Coordinators

        Northwestern Regional Coordinator  =  85:10/0  Raymond Quinn
        Southwestern Regional Coordinator  =  85:20/0  Mike Downey
        Northcentral Regional Coordinator  =  85:30/0  Eric Kimminau
        Southcentral Regional Coordinator  =  85:40/0  Jack Schofield
        Northeastern Regional Coordinator  =  85:60/0  Brad Straub
        Southeastern Regional Coordinator  =  85:80/0  Toby Wellborn
            Canadian Regional Coordinator  =  85:90/0  Brent Smith
       NorthEuropeon Regional Coordinator  =  85:100/0 Felipe Sevenson

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   This is then broken down into State Hosts and Hubs

   All Echo mail should be picked up through your respective
   echo Host/Hub.
