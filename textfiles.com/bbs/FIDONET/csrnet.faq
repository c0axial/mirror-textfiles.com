(June 20, 1993)


Forward:
========

           Hopefully this document will cover any other questions you
	may have that have as of yet gone unanswered. If not, please,
	when you send me a message, make sure to include the question
        that you felt was unanswered and I will try to cover it in one
	of the other documents, or I will include it in this one.


F.A.Q.'s
========

	Q. Does CSRNet carry the InterNet Private E-Mail conference,
	   and if so, if I was to carry CSRNet, would I be able to
	   write a message on my system to someone on CompuServe, for
           instance?

	A. YES. The InterNet Private E-Mail confernce was one of the 
           first items that we connected into when CSRNet was formed.
           You can, and will be able to write a message on your system
           to anyone that you have an InterNet address for. This includes,
           just to name a few, Delphi, CompuServe, America Online,
           AppleLink, AT&T EasyLink Sevices, BitNet, Connect, Genie and
           FidoNet.


 	Q. If I become a HOST and feed other systems locally, do they
           have to send you $10 a month as well? 

	A. NO. The only fee I require is the $10 per month fee I charge
           for systems that get their mail DIRECTLY from me. This fee
	   is to help cover the cost of my monthly connection fee as
           well as my phone bill to bring in this feed Long Distance.
           You can and are highly encouraged to pass your feed onto other
           local systems. You may also implement a monthly fee of your
           own to help cover your cost of bringing in CSRNet Long
           Distance.


	Q. Can I feed other systems that are NOT local to me?

	A. MAYBE. If you are currently the only HOST in your State or
           Province, and there are other systems in your Region, ie, 
           State or Province, and you are recieving a majority of the
	   newsgroups being carried by CSRNet, then all you have to
           do is ask to become an RC and that will entitle you to feed
	   Long Distance systems in your Region.


	Q. Do you use the same addressing format and Interface as a
           true InterNet connection?

	A. Because most BBS software limits the number of characters
 	   allowed in the "TO:" field of a message, we use a slightly
	   different format that handles the job quite well and is just
   	   as effective. Please refer to the INTERNET.INF file that
	   accompanied this document. It contains all the specific
	   information that you may be looking for.


	Q. If I don't want to poll you in Cananda for the mail, can I
	   poll a CSRNet system in the United States instead?

	A. MAYBE. If there is a HOST CSRNet system in your State, then 
	   I will be more then happy to allow you to get the mail from 
	   that system, as long as I am notified before the feed is
	   established. This applies to Long Distance systems only. If,
	   however, there isn't a HOST CSRNet system in your State, I
	   would prefer that you poll me for the mail and if you wish,
	   I can make you the HOST CSRNet system for your State.


	Q. If I wanted to be a State or Provincial RC and wanted to
	   recieve ALL of the newsgroups that were being carried, how
	   much mail would that be on a nightly basis?

	A. At the present time, I am bringing in about 1.5 megs of 
	   compressed mail nightly, for the 60 some odd newsgroups we
	   are currently carrying.


	Q. What special Software do I require to carry these InterNet
	   Newsgroups and the InterNet Private E-Mail Conference?

	A. If you are currently carry Echo-Mail, such as FidoNet, you
	   have everything that you need. If not, you will need to
	   pick up a program for your specific BBS software that will
	   allow you to toss Echo-Mail into your BBS conferences.


Closing:
