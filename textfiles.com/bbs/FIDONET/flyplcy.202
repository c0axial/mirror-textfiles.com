                         Policies and Procedures
                              Version 2.02
                              June 17, 1992


This document has been set forth as the official policy of The FlyNet
Aviation Network and supercedes all previous editions immediately.


1. MISSION AND PURPOSE


The sole purpose of FlyNet is to provide a "gathering place" for
electronic bulletin board system users interested in socializing with
others in a relaxed environment as well as provide a place to trade,
inform and search for information on anything having to do with Aviation
and related topics of interest.
 
FlyNet is funded solely by interested Zone, Region and Net Coordinators
and users. The plan for this network is solely up to its users, there
are many things that will be implemented as it grows and people show
interest in it.

New EchoMail and Tick file areas, as well as any other ideas, are always
welcomed. We encourage input from the membership. We feel this network
is long overdue for Aviation.
 
FlyNet is the membership. Without its members, FlyNet would not exist.
With this in mind, certain procedures and policies have been established
to provide a basis for how FlyNet will operate. The procedures and
policies outlined provide FlyNet with a structure in which to operate
and are based on the concept that FlyNet will remain flexible to the
needs of its members. Procedures have been established to allow for
proper action in any matter that may present itself and is protected by
the right of the membership to vote and an appropriate appeal process.


2.  MAIL TIMES


Mail will be distributed to the Zone, Region and Net Coordinators
nightly during a preset time, Net Coordinators will establish schedules
to route NetMail and EchoMail to the member systems. The Net Coordinator
can poll the Region Coordinator anytime to get fresh mail.


3.  MESSAGE BASE AND MAILER COMPATABILITY


The FlyNet Network supports the FIDO Message Base system, you must be
able to send and receive FIDO compatible messages and mail packets in
order to properly function with other systems.

4.  ECHOMAIL ETIQUETTE (An excerpt from FIDOnet)


  a.  BE HELPFUL AND FRIENDLY

The electronic acquaintances you'll make on our network may well turn
into lifelong friends.  You may see a lot of characters in mail like :-)
or :) or ;-).  These aren't line noise.  They're smiles (if you hold
your head right).  You'll also see <GRIN>s and other manifestations of
this idea everywhere.  Many of our callers use these little touches to
indicate that the comment was meant to be friendly and humorous.

  b.  READ THE MESSAGE BASE TILL YOU'RE COMFORTABLE

Jumping into a message base can be a scary thing at first. Read the
conference description and understand what type of discussions are
welcomed in the conference in which you want to begin participating. Try
to read several day's worth of messages before you post that first
message.

  c.  KEEP YOUR MESSAGES ON TOPIC

When you do start to post, try not to stray off the topics of the
conference. If you are posting about chili cooking in the COMM
conference, you are causing nodes to download messages they don't want.
They're reading COMM to talk about communications. You are probably also
duplicating topics that are under discussion in other, more appropriate
conferences. In the above example, it would be a good idea to move your
thread to the COOKING conference and ask the others to join you.

  d.  NO PERSONAL FLAMES

Although users are encouraged to express personal opinion in conferences
where appropriate, the use of personal flames in messages directed at
other members of the conference is frowned upon, and can result in
formal suspension from EchoMail areas for an un-specified time period by
the moderator of the conference at their discretion.

There is a difference between direct, personal attack directed toward an
individual, and lively discussion or expression of personal opinion.  We
encourage *idea* exchange, but if you cannot communicate those ideas
without attacking another caller personally, you will be better off
dropping the conference. Your moderator will let you know what is
acceptable.  Remember, treat people as you would have them treat you.

                 *  DON'T QUOTE EXCESSIVELY

Most message readers offer "quote" functions. Quotes are parts of the
original message that you copy into your reply to help maintain the
continuity of a thread. Big quotes mean big phone bills to transfer,
since these messages are effectively duplicates. Experience also shows
that people just DON'T READ posts with lots of big quotes. Use quotes
sparingly!!  Of all, this is the biggest and most blatant problem
plaguing networks.

5.  JOINING FLYNET


If you wish to become a member of FlyNet, please make sure you fully
understand the information provided within this document and follow the
procedures in the FlyNet Welcome Packet.

Your system must be at least 30 days old and operate 24 hrs a day. If
you feel that your system qualifies without having been in operation for
30 days, you may state your reasons in a NetMail message to the Net
Coordinator (or Region Coordinator) that you forward your application
to. The Net Coordinator (or Region Coordinator) will notify you of the
status of your request.

We will need to know your real name, handle, board name, software you
are using, type of modem and both data and voice numbers where we may
reach you.

In the event that your system will be down for more than a day or so,
you will need to notify your Net Coordinator. This is the only
acceptable way of informing the rest of the network that you will be
down for any length of time.

If you will be dropping out of the network for a period of time longer
than two or three weeks please let your Net Coordinator know the reasons
for this action as well as an estimated time of return to the network.
This will allow your Net Coordinator to properly handle your inbound
NetMail and EchoMail.



6. ACTIONS REQUIRED FOR SUBMISSION OF PROPOSALS


The following actions must be followed for the submission of proposals:

In the case of a request for proposals from an Zone, Region or Net level
appointed committee, proposals should be submitted via private NetMail
directly to the committee.

In the absense of an appointed committee, proposals shall be submitted
to the Net Coordinator of your Net.

On Net level proposals, the Net Coordinator will review and take
whatever action is required to either implement or reject the proposal.
On proposals that include a scope broader then the single Net, the
proposal will be forwarded to the Region Coordinator serving the area
along with the Net Coordinators recommendations.

On Region level proposals, the Region Coordinator will review and take
whatever action is required to either implement or reject the proposal.
On proposals that include a scope broader then the single Region, the
proposal will be forwarded to the Zone Coordinator serving the area
along with the Region and Net Coordinators recommendations.

FlyNet Policy Document                                   Version 2.02 6/17/92



On Zone level proposals, the Zone Coordinator will review and take
whatever action is required to either implement or reject the proposal.

Action on a proposal may be handled in several different forms:

  a. The Coordinator at the level at which the proposal is intended may
either implement or reject the proposal based on the information at
hand.

  b. A committee may be appointed to further review and recommend action
on a proposal. The committee will report its recommendation to the
appropriate Coordinator for action as described in this section.

  c. A vote of the general membership at the appropriate Zone, Region or
Net level may be called.

In the case of rejection, the Coordinator at the appropriate level will
submit a rejection summary to the author of the proposal via private
NetMail. The author of the proposal may then request that the proposal
be presented to the appropriate Net, Region or Zone membership for a
vote of the general membership at the appropriate level.



7. MATTERS REQUIRING A VOTE OF THE GENERAL MEMBERSHIP


On Zone level matters, the Zone Coordinator will announce the call for a
vote, including the ballot deadline for the Zone, as well as other

message in the FlyNet AVIA_SYSOP conference The Zone Coordinator will
also include the same information in a private NetMail message to each
Region Coordinator in the Zone. Region Coordinators will cross post the
message in the appropriate Region Sysop EchoMail conference and include
the ballot deadline for the Region. Region Coordinators will also
include the same information in a private NetMail message to each Net
Coordinator in the Region. Net Coordinators will cross post the message
in the appropriate Net Sysop EchoMail conference and include the ballot

ballots will be counted. Ballots not cast will not count for or against
the matter at hand, they will simply be no ballot. After the deadline
for casting ballots, the Net Coordinator will post the ballot results, by
number of ballots in each category, in the appropriate Net Sysop EchoMail
conference. The Net Coordinator must retain the ballots of the Net for a
period of 60 days from the ballot deadline.

Where the ballot results are for a Zone or Region ballot, the Net
Coordinator will forward the number of total eligible ballots, the total
number of received ballots, and the number of ballots in each category
to the Region Coordinator.
