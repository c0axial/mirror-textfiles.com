                     CHATEAU  EXINE  HOTEL  &  RESORT

     Hello, and welcome to the most unique resort in the world.
My name is Exine D'Marillion, the owner and manager of this
resort. Your vacation has been paid for in advance so all you
need do is ask for whatever you many need...or just plain want.
The thousands of acres of land have been in my family for
hundreds of years and has been a secret playground for the rich
and famous for a long time. The hotel used to house dignitaries
of all nationalities and persuasion. I recently came to the
decision to open its doors for you.  You may even see a celebrity
here and there wondering about the grounds or playing tennis or
running buck naked in the halls of the hotel.

     Our credo at Chateau Exine is simple: hedonism.  Extreme
pleasures and fantasy await behind every door and around every
corner.  Clothing is optional with our guests.  The staff is
clothed only as formality, if that offends you, you have the
unspoken right to request that staff member to disrobe. Of course
as the colder weather sets in, please be considerate when out of
doors.  I had a female ski instructor last year who's nipples
turned blue and came down with a nasty cold.  We like our staff
to have as much fun as the guests.

     Let's give you a small tour so that you are familiar with
the facilities during your stay.  Here in our spacious lobby, to
the left is our giftshop.  At the front desk we have constantly
have several people on duty to await your whims. All you have to
do is punch 69 on your touchtone phone from your room.  Need
enough champagne to take a bath in? Call. Need a maid to give you
a bath? Call. Just need someone to talk to late at night? Call.
Need someone to share that big double bed in your room? Call. 
     Directly over to the right from the desk through the
corridor is the elevators going all the way to the 20th floor.
You even have access to the roof where we sometimes have star
gazing couples...and others who just want to be under the stars.
We have several telescopes so you may look for your favorite
constellation...or look down to spy on your favorite couple on
the grounds during the day. You never know WHO you're going to
find in WHAT compromising position
     If we walk past the elevator corridors, to the right of our
lobby is our bar and nightclub, The Innuendo Lounge. This place
gets really hopping at night. We have a backroom in the lounge
with a community hottub. Feel free to jump in anytime. Our
waiters and waitresses will serve your favorite drink to you as
you soak...or whatever you may do!
     On the second floor is our restaurant, D'Marillion's, where
all your meals are served. Of course you may request that your
meals be sent to your room, you may also request a gorgeous
dinnermate to share them with if you came alone. Our chefs come
from all over the world and can whip up anything edible that your
little heart desires.
     On the third floor is our adult video store rentals, workout
and fitness rooms, and massage parlour.
     In our basement, is our little dungeon where we cater to our
S&M clietele, with all kinds of gadgets, gizmos, and "toys".
     The entrance to the parking garage is next to the gift shop.
If we step outside you can see the slopes to the right, which are
great for skiing in the winter months and just as wonderful for
hiking and camping during the summer. We have a 30 acre lake
stocked with all kinds of fish for the anglers. There are boat
rentals available and I have yet to see anybody frown for lack of
a boat.  We have the tennis courts and pool over by the lake. But
PLEASE, PLEASE ask our boat rental people for a bottle of
sunblock so that certain parts of your body don't excessively
burn while you're playing out on the waters. Down the road a
little bit are the villas where you can stay if you'd like some
individual privacy. Each is equipped with a hot tub and
fireplace, and some rooms have their own private 10' x 15' pool
(3' deep).  
     We are always looking for new ways to serve our guests and
bring a little excitement into everyone's lives. Your suggestions
are always welcome

     That's the basic layout of the resort so that we're all
talking about the same thing. Now here are the rules:
Rule #1. Please be considerate of the other guests and staff when
        writing your posts. Fantasies acted out on this board    
        are between consenting adults. 
Rule #2. When posting your message and relaying your tales, in   
        the subject line, please indicate what room or where on
        the resort you are. For example:
        Subject: Room #1312 in the bathroom
   or   Subject: On the lake in our boat
   or   Subject: Innuendo Lounge
        (You get the idea!!)
Rule #3. Clothes are optional on the whole resort, however if you
         go off our grounds, PLEASE wear something.
Rule #4. Have fun!!!!!!
Rule #5. If you have a question about the Chateau, please ask me.
Rule #6. Please do NOT use the Chateau for personal wars. This
         is a role playing fantasy and for FUN!! If you are told
         your conversation is not pertaining to the theme of the
         Chateau, please move it without argument to a conference
         more suited. Troublemakers WILL be dealt with  
         accordingly. I hate to be a tyrant, so let's all have
         fun!
Rule #7. There are no more rules, no language restrictions, etc.
