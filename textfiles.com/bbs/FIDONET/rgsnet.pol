==============================================================================
                                    Chapter 1

                                    OVERVIEW
==============================================================================


1.1     Objective

    To connect Renegade Systems across the Nation and the World into a  
    FidoNet Compatible Network for the "Free Exchange of Information."

    We (The Renegade Support Network) have no intentions of trying to replace 
    or compete with the existing FidoNet Network.  We (The Renegade Support
    Network) only want a means of communicating directly with other Renegade  
    SysOps across the nation and to enhance the transmission  of  messages 
    across the nation and to further develop Renegade.

    This document is an attempt to describe the procedures which have
    been developed to manage The Renegade Support Network (RGSNet).


1.2     Background

    FidoNet is an amateur electronic mail system.  From its early
    beginnings as a few friends swapping messages back and forth, it has
    now grown to (June 1994) over 25000 different systems on four
    continents.

    RGSNet is attempting to provide the resources to a Renegade System
    Operator (SysOp) and the tools to connect into a Network of other
    Bulletin Board (BBS) SysOps across the nation.  We are also able to
    provide partial international connectivity as well.

    RGSNet will not try to reinvent the wheel.  We will adopt most of
    of the standards that International FidoNet Association has already
    adopted into their network.


1.3     Definitions

RGSNet nodes are grouped on several levels.  These are as follows:

       Nodes:   A node is a single Net address, and is the smallest
                recognized unit of the Net.

        Hubs:   A hub is a collection of nodes, usually in a
                relatively small geographic area.  Hubs coordinate
                their mail activity to decrease cost and increase mail
                throughput.

    Networks:   A collection of hubs/nodes within a slightly larger 
                geographic area (an individual state for example). 
                Networks are treated just like large hubs. 
                Therefore, all that applies for Hubs ... also applies 
                for Networks.

     Regions:   A collection of a group of networks within a specified 
                geographical region, usually several states grouped together.
                A  region is a well defined geographic area containing
                nodes which may or may not be combined into networks.
                A typical region will contain many nodes in networks,
                and a few independent nodes, which are not a part of
                any network.

       Zones:   (Not applicable)
                A  zone  is  a  large  geographic area containing many
                regions, and covering one  or  more  countries  and/or
                continents.

      RGSNet:   This indicates the entire mail network, as designed by
                the Renegade Support Network Coordinators and as defined 
                by the weekly nodelist.


1.4     The Levels of RGSNet

    With the introduction of The Renegade Support Network, RGSNet has 
    developed the following levels of organization:

    
    The Zone Coordinator

        The Zone Coordinator compiles all of the nodelists
        for the entire Zone and creates the master nodelist,
        which is then distributed across The Renegade Support Network.
        Any disputes at the Regional level are handled by the Zone 
        Coordinator and/or his assignees.

    
    The Regional Coordinator

        The Regional Coordinator is responsible for maintaining the list 
        of Networks for his Region, and for receiving and forwarding any
        mail coming to the region from the outside.  He is also responsible
        for the maintenance of the members of his region and will ensure 
        proper use of the network by those members.  Any disputes at the
        Network Level are handled by the Regional Coordinator and/or his 
        assignees.
    
    
    The Network Coordinator

        The Network Coordinator is responsible for maintaining the
        list of nodes for his network, and for receiving and
        forwarding any mail coming to the network from the outside.
        He is also responsible for the maintenance of the members of
        his network and will insure proper use of the network by those
        members.  Any disputes at the Network Routing Hub Level are handled 
        by the Network Coordinator and/or his assignees.
    
    
    The Network Routing Hub

        Network Routing Hubs exist only in three-tiered networks. They
        generally share some or all of the duties of the Network
        Coordinator, in order to ease the management of a large
        network.  The exact duties and procedures are a matter for the
        Network Coordinator and his hubs to settle, and will not be
        discussed here.  The  Network Coordinator is still responsible
        for the maintenance of the network and insures proper  use  of
        the network for the people in his Routing Hub.  All disputes at the
        node level, should be addressed by the Routing Hub, before being 
        forwarded to the Network Coordinator.

    
    The System Operator (SysOp)

        The SysOp formulates his own policy  for running his board and
        dealing with his users, so that will not be discussed in  this
        document.  However, the sysop must also mesh with the rest of
        the RGSNet Systems if he is to send and receive mail, and
        that will be discussed here.

    
    The User

        Policy and procedures for the individual user on any given
        board is determined by the system operator of that board, and
        will not be considered in this document.

    These levels  act  to  distribute  the  administration  and  control of
    RGSNet  to  the  lowest  possible  level,  while  still  allowing for
    coordinated action over the entire mail system.


==============================================================================
                                  Chapter 2

                               SYSOP PROCEDURES
==============================================================================

    A SysOp of an individual node can pretty much do as he pleases, as
    long as he observes the mail events, is not excessively annoying to
    other nodes on RGSNet or any other FidoNet Compatible Network,
    and does not promote the distribution of pirated copyrighted software.

    National Mail Hour (also known as ZMH, or Zone Mail Hour) is the heart 
    of any Netmail Network, as this is when the network mail is passed 
    between systems.  Any system which wishes to be a part of a NetMail 
    Network must be able to receive mail at this time.  A system which is 
    a member of a network may also be required to observe additional mail 
    events, as defined by his Network Coordinator.

    Network mail systems generally operate unattended, and place calls at
    odd hours of the night. If a system tries to call an incorrect or out
    of date number, it could cause some poor citizen's phone to ring in
    the wee hours of the morning, much to the annoyance of innocent
    bystanders and civil authorities.  For this reason, a SysOp who sends
    mail is obligated to obtain and use the most recent edition of the
    nodelist as is practical.

    The exact timing of National Mail Hour is set for the zone by the
    Zone Coordinator.  In the United States, National Mail Hour is observed 
    from 0900 to 1000 GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) every day,  weekends included.  
    In each of the United States time zones, this would be as follows:

                   Eastern Standard Time         4 AM to 5 AM
                   Central Standard Time         3 AM to 4 AM
                   Mountain Standard Time        2 AM to 3 AM
                   Pacific Standard Time         1 AM to 2 AM
                   Hawaii Standard Time         11 PM to 12 Midnight

    Networks do not observe daylight savings time.  In areas which  observe
    daylight savings time the RGSNet mail schedules must be adjusted
    in the same direction as the clock change.  Alternatively, you can
    simply leave your system on standard time.


2.1     How to get a node number

    You must first  obtain a current nodelist so that you can send mail.
    You do not need a node number to send mail, but you must  have  one  in
    order for others to send mail to you.

    The first step in obtaining a current nodelist is to locate the
    closest RGSNet Bulletin Board System to you.

    If the SysOp of any RGSNet system does not have a nodelist available
    for downloading, then he can probably tell you where to get one, BUT we
    STRONGLY suggest all nodes carry and allow for download the most recent
    RGSNLIST.Z?? and related RGSNet files.

    Once you have a nodelist, you must determine which network or region
    covers your area. If you are unsure of this or there is not one in
    your area, send the information to the Zone Coordinator @ 50:50/0.

    Once you have located the network or region in your area, send  a
    request for a node number to node zero of that network or region.  The
    request must be sent by a NetMail message and must include at least the
    following:

        1) Your name.
        2) The name of your system.
        3) The city and state where your system is located.
        4) The phone number to be used when calling your system.
        5) Your hours of operation.
        6) The maximum baud rate you can support.
        7) BBS Software Version.
        8) NetMail Interface Program.
        9) A list of EchoMail Conferences that you wish to pick up.
       10) Voice number (Internal use only!).

    Your coordinator may want additional information.  If so, he/she will
    contact you.

    Please allow at least five working days for a node number request to be
    processed.  If you send your request to the Zone Coordinator, then
    he may forward your request to the Network Coordinator who covers your
    area (if any), which may take longer.


2.2     If you are going down

    If  your  node  will be down for an extended period (more than a day or
    two), then you should inform your coordinator as soon as possible.  If
    you do not do this, then other systems will still try to reach  you
    while  you  are  down, much to the annoyance of everyone.  Do not under
    any circumstances put an answering machine or similar device on your
    phone line while you are down. If you do, then calling systems will
    get the machine repeatedly, racking up large phone bills, which is
    VERY annoying.

    If you will be leaving your system unattended for an extended period
    of time (such as while you are on vacation), you should notify your
    coordinator.  Systems _do_ have a tendency to "crash" now and then, so
    you will probably want your coordinator to know that it is a temporary
    condition if it happens while you are away.


2.3     How to join a network

    If you are an independent node and would like to join a network in
    your  area,  you  must  contact  the  Network  Coordinator.  He can be
    reached by sending Netmail to node zero of the network.  He will
    inform you of any special mail schedules and/or routing required by
    the network.  Once you have been placed in the network, you will be 
    informed by the Network Coordinator.

    There are many advantages to being in a network.  First and foremost
    is that it helps reduce congestion of RGSNet during National Mail
    Hour.  Also, many networks are "outbound" as well as "inbound", which
    can substantially reduce your phone bills.  In addition, network
    members receive regular updates of the nodelist, while an independent
    node may not.


2.4     How to form a network

    If there are several nodes in your area,  but no network, then you may
    wish to form your own.  Again, this has several advantages as outlined
    above.

    Your first step is to contact the other SysOps in your area.  You must
    decide which nodes will comprise the network,  and which of those nodes
    is  going  to be the  Network Coordinator.  Your next step is to inform
    Network Administration.  You must send him a NetMail message with the
    following information:


        1)  The region number(s), or network number(s) if a network is
            splitting up,  that  are affected by the formation of your
            network.  The Regional Coordinator will inform the
            Zone Coordinator and the coordinators of any affected 
            networks that a new network is in formation.

        2)  The name that you wish to call your network. Please try to
            select a name that relates to your grouping.  For example,
            SoCalNet for nodes in the Southern California Area
            and MassNet for Massachusetts Area.  Remember if you
            call yourself DOGNET it doesn't help others know what area
            of the  country  (or  even what country) your group is in.

        3)  A copy of the proposed network's nodelist. The nodelist
            file should be named RGSNET.nnn where "nnn" is the
            proposed host's current region or network number.
            This file should be sent attached to the message of
            Application for a Network Number.

                                  Chapter 3

                        NETWORK COORDINATOR PROCEDURES
==============================================================================


    A Network Coordinator has the following responsibilities:

        1)  To receive incoming mail for nodes in his network,  and to
            deliver it to its recipients.  This mean you have to  poll
            the Regional Coordinator or Mail Distribution System to 
            receive your mail.

        2)  To assign node numbers to nodes in his network.

        3)  To  maintain  the nodelist for his network, and to send a
            copy of it to the Regional Coordinator whenever it changes.

        4)  To  pass  along  to his nodes the new nodelist, nodelist
            updates and new issues of RGSN????.ZIP as they are received.


3.1     Routing inbound mail

    It is your responsibility as Network Coordinator to receive all
    inbound mail for nodes in your network and to forward it to its
    recipients.  You  are  left  to  your  own discretion as to how best to
    accomplish this.

    If a node in your network is routing large  volumes of  EchoMail,   you
    can  ask  him to either limit the amount of  EchoMail,  or even to stop
    routing his  EchoMail completely.  The design of EchoMail is such  that
    it is a simple matter to do either of these.  Or they can break off out
    of your network.


3.2     Assigning node numbers

    It is your responsibility to assign node numbers to new nodes in your
    network.  You may also change the numbers of existing nodes in your
    network,  though you should check with your member nodes before doing
    so.  You may assign any numbers you wish, so long as each node has a
    unique number within your network.


3.3     Maintaining the nodelist

     You should attempt to implement name changes, phone number changes, 
     etcetera in your nodelist as soon as possible, and to forward the
     revised Nodelist to your Regional Coordinator whenever a change occurs.

     You should also on occasion send a message to every node in your
     network to ensure that they are still operational.  If a node turns
     out to be "off the air" with no prior warning given to you, then you
     can either mark the node as down, make it temporarily inactive, or 
     remove it from the nodelist completely, at your own discretion.


3.4     Passing along nodelists and RGSNet Info Packets

    As a Network Coordinator you should obtain a new nodelist update every
    week.  The nodelist update is posted weekly on Saturdays.  The list will
    be made available to you by Network Administration.

    You  should pass both of these along to your member nodes as soon as is
    practical  after  you receive them.  It is also desirable that you make
    them both available for downloading by the general user,  but  this  is
    not required.

    The  nodelists  are the glue that holds us together.  Without them, we
    cease to be a community, and become  just  another random collection of
    bulletin boards.



==============================================================================
                                  Chapter 4

                      REGIONAL COORDINATOR PROCEDURES
==============================================================================



    Regional Coordinators have the following responsibilities:

        1)  To assign node numbers to independent nodes in the region.

        2)  To  encourage independent nodes in the region to join
            existing networks or to form new networks.

        3)  To assign network numbers to networks in the region.

        4)  To compile a nodelist of all of the networks and
            independents in the region, and to send a copy of it to
            the Mail Distribution Node whenever it changes.

        5)  To ensure the smooth operation of the networks within the
            region.


4.1     Assigning Node numbers

    The responsibility to assign node numbers to new network in the region.
    You may also change the numbers of existing networks in the region,
    though you should check with the respective nodes before doing so.
    The numbers assigned to networks must be within the RGSNet Network
    Plan in order for future growth of the region to be possible.

    You should use network mail (netmail) to inform a new node of their 
    node number, as this helps to insure that he is capable of receiving 
    network mail.

    If you receive a node number request from a new node that is in an
    area covered by an existing network, then you should forward the
    request to the Coordinator of that network instead of assigning  a
    number yourself.


4.2     Encouraging the formation and growth of networks

    One of your main duties as the Regional Coordinator is to promote
    the growth of networks in the region.

    You should try to avoid having independent nodes in the region which
    are within the coverage area of a network.  There are, however,
    certain cases where a node should not be a member of a network, such
    as a commercial system with a large volume of traffic which would clog
    the network.  The resolution of such special cases is left to your own
    discretion.

    If several independent nodes in your region are in a "clump", then you
    should encourage them to form a network.  Refer to the SysOp procedure
    forming a network on forming a network for details of what information
    you should get.

    Note that this does not mean to encourage the formation of trivial
    networks.  Obviously,  one node does not make a network.  The exact
    number of nodes required for an effective network must be judged
    according to the circumstances of the situation, and should be
    according to the plan of the region.


4.3     Assigning network numbers

    It is your responsibility to assign network  numbers  to  new  networks
    forming  within  your  region.  The  network  numbers  are  assigned by
    referring to the RGSNet Network Plan.


4.4     Maintaining the nodelist

    The Regional Coordinator has a dual role in maintaining the nodelist for
    the region.

    First, you must maintain the list of independent nodes in your region.
    You should attempt to implement name changes, phone number changes,
    and so forth in this nodelist as soon as possible.  You should also
    on occasion send a message to every independent node in your region to
    ensure that they are still operational.  If a node turns out to be
    "off the air" with no prior warning given to you, then you can either
    mark the node as down, make it temporarily inactive, or remove it from
    the nodelist completely, at your own discretion.

    Second, you must receive the nodelists from the Network Coordinators
    within your region. You should assemble a master nodelist for your
    region every week and send it to the Zone Coordinator no later than 
    National Mail Hour on Friday morning. It is suggested that
    you do this as late as is practical,  so as to accommodate any late
    changes.

    You will need to maintain a set of nodelists for each network within
    your region, since you cannot count on getting an update from each
    Network Coordinator every week.


4.5     Overseeing network operations

    It is the responsibility of Regional Coordinator to ensure that the
    networks within the region are operating in an acceptable manner.
    This does not mean that you are required to operate those networks,
    that is the responsibility of the Network Coordinators.  It means that
    you are responsible for seeing to it that the Network Coordinators
    within your region are acting responsibly.

    It is the obligation of Regional Coordinator to maintain direct and
    reasonably frequent contact with the networks in the region.  The
    exact method of accomplishing this is left to your discretion.


4.6     Passing along nodelists and RGSNet Info Packets

    Regional Coordinators are responsible for obtaining the latest RGSNet
    nodelist updates and any RGSNet Info Packets as they are published,
    and to make them available to the Network Coordinators within your
    region.  The Nodelist is posted weekly on Saturday's by RGSNet HQ @
    Node #50:50/0.

    It is your responsibility to distribute these to any Network
    Coordinators in your region as soon as is practical after you receive
    them.  The method of distribution is left to your discretion.  You are
    not required to distribute them to any independent nodes in your
    region, though you may if you wish.  It is also desirable that you
    make them both available for downloading by the general user, but this
    is not required.

                            ECHOMAIL CONFERENCES
==============================================================================


        EchoMail  Conferences  are messages that are passed around the
        nation and the world.  These conferences can range from  
        very technical topics to very casual ones.  Some may even  
        have offensive language in them.  So, it is very important  
        that you only choose the ones that would be of interest to 
        you and/or your users.  You can always add and/or delete the  
        conferences that you choose.

        For a current list of the available EchoMail Conferences, ask
        your Network Coordinator for the current list. It will also be
        available for download and/or file requestable from
        Mail Distribution @ 50:50/0 as "RGSNET.NA".

        If you are receiving EchoMail Conferences from RGSNet, it is
        mandatory that you NOT forward RGSNet or any another Network
        EchoMail Conferences to NON-RGSNet Systems.  Also, do not
        accept feeds of the same EchoMail Conference from more than
        one source.  If you do, it will create duplicate messages in
        EVERYONES Network.  Violation of this will not be tolerated!
