     Private mail is only allowed in the THROBMAIL conference!

   Private mail creates a special problem here on ThrobNet. First off
   you need to understand 2 things. 1st, private mail isn't really
   private. The sysop's of any/all BBS's have the right to monitor,
   change, delete and or make public, *ANY* message tha comes across
   their system. Generally this isn't done, but you should be aware that
   it *MIGHT* be done. If what you are saying must be held truly
   private, then for god's sake, use the US Mail or the telephone!

   2nd, ThrobNet supports many different types of mailing programs, but
   this won't make it hard for you to send private mail. While entering
   your message (whether online or offline) simply mark the message as
   private (usually PVT). When uploaded to your local BBS please take
   the time to make sure that it got inserted properly into the
   Throbmail Conference (this is the only avenue for sending private
   messages throughout the network). Double check to make sure it is
   marked private. If it's not private, then you should remove
   the message, and try again. If after several attempts, it still remains
   as a public message, then please notify ThrobNet admin. and we will
   get in touch with your sysop and try to get it working properly.
