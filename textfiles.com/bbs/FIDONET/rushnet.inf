       Rushnet will be the easiest Net you ever joined. Just fill out
       the rushnet.app - upload to Crystal Palace - configure the
       enclosed Rushnet.cfg for your BBS and start calling. I don't
       verify your board-I don't require you use all the conferences.
       In fact the only thing I require is the application.
     

       If you have any suggestions-let me know and if your users
       want more conferences-let me know. This Network  runs like
       the country would if Rush Limbaugh was President!

       If someone out there wants to draw up a nice ansi screen
       for BBSes to use as Hello screen-go for it!
       

       Please Please DON"T call the Host BBS unless you are calling
       from the 818 area codes. The entire country is covered with
       HUBs that would love you to call them and set up your account!
       Check the list of enclosed Hubs!

       We would still like to have more Hubs. Especially needed are
       Hubs in New England, New York City, Canada and for obvious
       reasons Washington DC. 

       Reminder! Please set up an account on your board under the name
       of Rush Limbaugh with an alias of Rush Limbaugh. Any system that
       allows an imposter to log in will be dropped from the net!

       Questions: These are some questions that keep coming up.
       Can I advertise I'm on Rushnet?  YES
       Can I allow newusers access to Rushnet? Its up to you.
       Can we have more conferences? Sure I'll watch the Admin conference
       and if i see a demand for a topic we will start it.
       Whats the deal with the Letters to Rush conference? I will copy
       each letter off the system and forward it to Rush.
       Can I advertise Rush realted items on the Net? Sure
       Can I give Nodes access BEFORE you get the application?
       YES-You can approve any node you want.
       Can my users use aliases ?
       Yes but PLEASE have them sign the message with their real name!
       also in the Admin conference REAL NAMES only!
          
      

      Thanks  Daniel Mathis The Crystal Palace HOST for Rushnet!
