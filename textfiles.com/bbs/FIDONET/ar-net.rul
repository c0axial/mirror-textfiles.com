AmateurRadio Net(sm) Policy Document
====================================
 
As Of: July 1, 1995
 
Mission
=======

To provide a world wide forum to 1) discuss, 2) broadcast information 
regarding and 3) disseminate shareware / public domain files relating to 
Amateur Radio, SWL, Scanners, Citizen Band and other radio related 
topics via a network of computer bulletin boards.

Overview
========

AR-Net is a low hassle network. The conferences are distributed via QWK 
and FTS(FIDO) technologies. Fido distribution is done utilizing your 
normal FIDO node number or our Zone 599 node number. 

Members wishing to take distribution via FTS that are not members of 
Fidonet can obtain a AR-Net node number from the Host System, or the 
appropriate RC for their area.

The Rules
=========

1.  AR-Net Administration is the only required conference.  This is only 
done to insure a channel of communication to every node in the net.

2.  No profanity, name calling, hassling.  It's a family style network 
so if you can't play nice, take your toys and go home.

3.  Mail runs must be done at least every other day.  This will insure a
continuity in the message bases. (Provisions for over seas nodes will be 
handled on an 'as needed' basis)  Hubs must make mail runs daily. 

4.  Gateways to other networks must be approved in advance by the AR-Net
Network Host.

5.  SysOps are responsible for the behavior of their users.

6.  ARNxxxx Information Packet must be available for download on all
network nodes/hubs.  Just to help spread the word.

7.  Decisions on all matters of policy and network use will be made by 
the AR-Net Network Host.

8.  BBS Ads should be posted in the Ham BBS Conference Only.

9.  The AR-Net Network, Network Host SysOp, Network Administrators, HUB, 
or NODE SysOps will not be held liable for any claim for purchased items 
usefulness or functionality.

10. Please do not post ANSI graphics in messages EXCEPT the Ham BBS Ads 
Conference. Many users on the network are using computers that are not 
ANSI compatible. ANSI graphic characters will look like line noise on 
their screens.

11. Signature lines should be limited to two lines. Remember, a 
signature line is an informative line - include some useful information 
about you, your home QTH (city/state/country), and call sign. Every 
Tagline should have a Network ID. Below is an example:

AR-Net: The Silicon Garden þ Coram, NY þ 516-736-6662 þ N2HAA

Specific AR-Net taglines are NOT required.

12. The enforcement of these rules, as well as general "Common Sense" in 
the conferences, is the sole responsibility of the conference moderators 
and the AR-Net Host SysOp. Please do not interfere with the Conference 
Moderators job.  Do not take the law into your own hands. If you have a 
complaint, criticism or gripe, send a netmail message to the conference 
moderator or to John Woodstock.

13. The For Sale conference is for Ham Radio and Computer products. ALL
commercial notifications should be made in our DEALERS conference.

File Echoes
===========

Ham File Distribution Network:

The Network Host has the HDN available to FIDO nodes who do not have it 
available locally. Contact either him or your AR-Net Hub if you are 
interested in receiving the files.

The HDN is administered by Lee Laird. 

AR-Net also offers local file echos for its members
