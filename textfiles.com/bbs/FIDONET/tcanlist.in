
  The following names are of those individuals  who have been removed from the
  Intelec Network  for violations of our rules.  So if any of these users have
  accounts on your BBS, as an Intelec member  you are required to exclude them
  from accessing any Intelec forum.  This in most cases means locking them out
  of our forums.  It is not sufficient to let them access but deny ability for
  them to enter mail.  These users aren't to be able to access Intelec Network
  forums at all  and this includes not allowing them to have read-only access.
