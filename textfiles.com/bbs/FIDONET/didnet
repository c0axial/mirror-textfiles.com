      own disability-related problems, strengthen and enable individual
      communities to interconnect with the broader disability community

                        -> STRATEGY AND GOALS <-

   Provide a reliable, customer-service oriented computer network
   accommodating all three major technical specifications (QWK, FTS, and
   Internet) to globally link people with disabilities.

   Cultivate new sources of information (social, economic, commercial
   and political) and facilitate their transfer into electronic formats
   to increase distribution and translation into accessible formats.

   Encourage greater useful participation in discussions across
   disability groups and among different participants (individuals,
   specialists, professionals), leading to greater disability cultural
   awareness and information exchange.

   Expand the use and support of "electronic support groups", where
   people with disabilities collectively address issues of importance.
   Encourage greater discussion of difficult disability issues and the
   individual broadening of perspectives regarding needs outside their
   own.

   Encourage positive and supportive economic, social and political role
   models of, by and for people with disabilities which benefit
   individual disability cultures within the broader disability
   community and as productive members of society at large.
