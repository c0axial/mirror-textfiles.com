           This is a sister conference to Story. Because of the
           success of the Story conference, we had to add this area.
           This is for general 'Chat' type messages about the
           stories. Also in here are story list's , who's next,
           conformations of chapters posted etc....

                              FANTASY
            
           Originally, this was going to be a conference where users
           would post detailed descriptions of their fantasies.  It
           still is, but it turned out people liked to comment about
           each others fantasies, and then that naturally progresses
           into Modem Sex-type messages.  See SexTalk for an example
           of Modem Sex.  Friendly chatter and stuff like that do
           NOT belong in Fantasy, and should be moved to General or
           Violet's.
*************************************************************************
                               STORY

           round-robin stories.  In their specified order, users
           take turns posting the next chapter in whichever story
           they are signed up for.  If you want to sign up for a
           story, leave a message for Violet. Do NOT take it upon
           yourself to add the next chapter unless it's your turn -
           it'll just make things confusing.  This conference is NOT
           for user's writing samples or favorite text files - that
           belongs in Writings (see below). *ONLY STORY CHAPTERS
           SHOULD BE POSTED* Chat type messages should go in the
           Story Chat conference.

           are organized every once in a while.  Patrons can feel
           free to break off and discuss any topic amongst
           themselves, or ask Violet for a key to an upstairs room to
           have some privacy with one another.  Any topic is suitable

           the White House, or the idiot from the Issues conference.
