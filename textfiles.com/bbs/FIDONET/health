The HealthCare Network has been created to assist individuals and
organizations share information concerning the Health Care industry.
Discussion areas (echos/message areas) will cover most any medical
related issue, from specific conditions through the newest
advancements in medical technology.  The HealthCare Network's "File
Distribution Network" (FDN) provides for the release of programs and
informational files.  Additionally, various databases and text files
are being put together to be made available to the participants of the
Network.

The HealthCare Network itself is made up of two distinct sections:

1.  Public Access

The "Public Access" areas are open to all and will account for the
greatest amount of participation in the Network.  This area covers
most any subject imaginable and provides a number of general
information services for it's participants.

Some of the items available, or soon to be available, include:

      A.  Echo Areas (message areas) - Discussions on almost any
          medical related subject.

               etc...

      F.  Access to various organizations involved in the medical
          field.

      G.  Connections with numerous BBS's around the country (public,
          private, government, etc.) which specialize in medical and
          healthcare related issues.
