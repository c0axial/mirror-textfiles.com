     Dear Reader,

     Hello!  Glad you have taken the time to look at ThrobNet
     International Adult Network. If you are not familiar with us, you
     soon will be <g>.

     ThrobNet was started way back in 1989 when Violet got so horny that
     her hubby Doug Kent couldn't give her what she needed anymore.
     Violet, not knowing anything about computers, made Doug (with her
     whip) start up an all adult BBS so she had somewhere to play.  Doug
     already had a regular BBS (Zooman's Zoo) running in NYC.  So, they
     started echoing the adult conferences between the 2. After a  few
     months of this, several other BBS's had inquired on how they could
     get linked into these conferences. ThrobNet was born! Doug and
     Violet devoted 2 years to the network. Then they decided to step
     down. Joe Crosby had joined ThrobNet in it's early days, and when
     Doug decided he couldn't take it anymore, he passed it onto Joe.

     Since it's beginnings, ThrobNet has grown into the worlds
     largest *ADULTS* only network, with over 500 systems world-wide!
     In the last 5 years, ThrobNet has appeared several times in  The Wall
     Street Journal, Newsweek, Time, Playboy and a host of other
     publications.  However, we have encountered more and more potential
     legal roadblocks.  We believe strongly that you have a constitutional
     right to read and write the materials contained in ThrobNet's conference
     bases. But, we do find it necessary for you to sign the disclaimer form.
     By asking you to sign this disclaimer, we are simply insuring that you
     are an adult, and that you are giving an informed consent, since any
     consent is only valid if you are truly informed.

         1) You are 21 years of age or older
         2) You are aware that ThrobNet contains material of an
            adult nature
         3) You will refrain from using any materials that does not
            meet your local community standards.
         4) You are indeed, the owner of the BBS system applying for
            access.
         5) You are aware that you are NOT to allow any other BBS
            to echo ANY ThrobNet conference from you, without approval
            from ThrobNet administration.
         6) You realize that by signing this form, you are
            acknowledging that you are solely responsible for obtaining
            proof of age from your users/clients/friends, and ThrobNet
            International Adult Network, Joe Crosby, Laura Brito, Doug
            Kent, Violet, Laura's Lair nor Crosby Enterprises
            will be responsible for your proof, or lack thereof.
         7) Pirating of software, illegal activities, discussions about
            having sex with animals and/or children (less than 18 years of
            age) is strictly forbidden in any ThrobNet conference. These
            can not be discussed in any, shape or form, not even in third
            party settings, and you will inform your users of the same.
         8) You are acknowledging that free speech does not exist in
            ThrobNet. Any conversation or user may be removed at
            ThrobNet Administration's discretion. The Administration is
            not required to give advanced warnings before such removals.

    The Network Host will not be responsible for any problems
    resulting from membership in the network.  Participation in the
    network and the network conferences will not cause any
    responsibility, legal or otherwise, to be placed on the Network
    Host, the network itself, the Sysops of Laura's Lair, or related
    parties. The participating node or hub is responsible for all
    applicable laws and regulations, not the network or Laura's Lair.
    Once a fee is paid, it is non-refundable. No if's and's or but's
    about it.

Other Network rules are as follows:

All Network-related discussion is to take place in the NetAdmin
conference, which should be open only to Sysops of Network Hubs or Nodes.
Final word on any issue is to be decided by ThrobNet Administration.
Hubs in the network cannot redistribute the conferences to other BBS's
unless those other systems have already been admitted to the network.  By
applying to the network, you are accepting these rules and regulations,
along with any other rules the network decides to enact at a later date. 
Aliases are permitted in all conferences, although it is preferred
that Sysops use their real names, or sign all messages with their
BBS name.

   Our philosophy is simple. We are all adults, and we are doing this to
have fun. We at ThrobNet do not have a big egos, nor do we pretend to be
SysGods, but when we make a ruling, we expect it to be followed. There are
a few subjects that are definite no-no's on the network. Child Pornography &
Beastiality are allowed to be discussed in a fantasy setting only. You
may not trade videos, or otherwise assist others in obtaining videos,
pic's GIF's or any other form of graphic presentation of the
aforementioned subjects, via any ThrobNet conference. Repeated
infractions will cause undo hardship for those involved.

                    Laura Brito

                    Violet
