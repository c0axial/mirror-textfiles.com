     =================================================================
                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================

                      What is this thing called IFNA?


     What the heck is IFNA anyway?  And what can it do  for  ME?  This
     is  a  valid  and  important question.  We've created this outfit
     called IFNA, and even voted on bylaws for it,  but just what does
     it all mean, anyway?

     First and foremost,  IFNA is a legal entity,  a  not  for  profit
     corporation  in  and of the State of Missouri.  So what does that
     buy us?

     Well,  it turns out that there are certain advantages to having a
     corporation around.

     One that's been highly touted by a lawyer who was involved in the
     bylaws committee is the  "corporate  shield".  I  wish  I  had  a
     nickel for every time I've heard that phrase.  The general theory
     is that if the business of IFNA is running bulletin boards,  then
     if any member of IFNA is sued for something he did while  running
     a board his own personal assets will not be on the line.  All the
     plaintiff will be able to go for is the assets  of  IFNA  itself.
     I'm less than incredibly impressed with that argument.  It sounds
     to  me  like,  if push ever really comes to shove,  the so-called
     corporate shield of IFNA will be just  one  of  many  points  the
     lawyers  will  bandy  about,  much  to the expense of the parties
     involved.

     But that's not to say  that  there's  no  point  in  having  IFNA
     around.  I can see some advantages to it.

     The thing is that we seem to have two separate entities here.  On
     the  one hand we have IFNA,  which is this legal entity which may
     or may not mean anything.  On the other  hand  we  have  FidoNet,
     which  is  a coalition of sysops each doing his or her own thing.
     IFNA is governed by a Board of Directors elected by its  members,
     while FidoNet is governed by a loose hierarchy of coordinators on
     several  levels.  The  two  are  quite different,  so how do they
     connect?

     "The Net" we all know and love is FidoNet,  of course.  We  don't
     need  IFNA  to  govern the net.  FidoNet has its own policies and
     procedures to handle all of that quite nicely, thank you.  So why
     bother with all of this corporation nonsense?  There  are  a  few
     reasons:

     1)  Tax reasons;  This is really why IFNA was formed in the first
         place.   Ken  Kaplan,  the  International  Coordinator,   was
         incurring  some heavy expenses,  so he asked for some help to
         defray the costs.  People responded (thank you!), but the IRS
         saw those donations as income for Ken Kaplan, and did NOT see
         his expenses  as  legitimate  tax  deductions.  Incorporation
     Fidonews                     Page 3                   13 Apr 1987


         solves that.

     2)  There  are  some advantages to copyrighting the node list and
         FidoNews.  Mainly,  by copyrighting them we can  enforce  our
         policy  that  no one may sell them for a profit.  But someone
         has to hold the copyrights.  Saying that each is a collective
         work  of  1200+  people  doesn't  help  much.  By  forming  a
         corporation  we  create a legal entity to hold the copyrights
         on our collective property.

     3)  We're attracting some attention.  Various people in the media
         and in business are interested in what we're doing.  Having a
         recognized business entity for outsiders to deal  with  makes
         public  relations a lot easier.  And it sure doesn't hurt the
         average sysop for bulletin boards to get  a  little  positive
         press for a change!

     4)  While we're at it (and since,  once you get right down to it,
         we're a pretty potent market force) it'd be nice if we  could
         coerce  manufacturers  into  giving us some deals on hardware
         and software.  But companies  aren't  used  to  dealing  with
         loose  aggregations  of  individuals.   If  I  call  a  modem
         manufacturer, for example,  and say "Hi!  I'm a sysop,  and I
         have  a  lot of friends who are sysops -- what can you do for
         us?" it isn't going to cut much ice.  But if I call  and  say
         "I   represent  the  International  FidoNet  Association,   a
         coalition of over twelve hundred sysops worldwide" it carries
         some weight.  A good example of this is the current situation
         with 9600 baud modems.  We're in a pretty  good  position  to
         establish  the  de facto standard for 9600 baud.  It behooves
         us to (a) figure out which modems will do what we  want,  and
         (b)  get the best deal we can from anybody making modems that
         are good enough.  But we can't do that unless  we  have  some
         sort  of  cohesive organization for the manufacturers to deal
         with.

     So what is IFNA?  Three things,  mainly.  It's our PR department,
     our  legal  department,  and  our  public face.  That's all,  but
     that's enough.

                      LETTING 9 TO 5 GO BY THE BOARD

                               by Alice Kahn

       (c)  San Francisco Chronicle, 1987.  Reprinted by permission.

            So  I'm sitting in Hamburger Mary's talking to a guy  with
     orange  hair and a skateboard.   Big deal.   There are plenty  of
     fish with Technicolor hair skating in the SoMa sea.

            But Tom Jennings is different.  He's fresh and rad beneath
     the  surface,  a nonconformist trying to create his own life in a
     world that stomps on nonconformists.   He seems determined to  go
     where no man has
     gone before.

            Jennings   recently  went  "high  profile"  as  a  genuine
     character when,  at 31, he retired from his job at Apple Computer
     to live by his wits and his skateboard.

                              WHY'D HE DO IT?

            For me,  the only fun in being a journalist is having  the
     license  to  call up any unusual person you hear about and  lunch
     him.  So  I  ask Jennings why he has done something as  weird  as
     leaving  a  9-to-5  office job to  skateboard  - to  "shred"  the
     streets.   I'm  not  the first;  many have asked why he left  his
     "dream job" as a well-paid systems programmer at Apple,  as if  a
     young  man who has worked a third of his life in the  electronics
     bussiness  has no basis for feeling bored with it.  "I think it's
     the  West Coast infatuation with Apple Computer,"  he  says.   "I
     don't  mean to knock it.  For some it may be the orgasm of a job.
     But it's still a big corporation. It is run by a guy from Pepsi."
     It's soon clear that I'm with an artist whose masterpiece is  his
     own  life.   His  delight in risk-taking also makes it fun to  be
     around him.  There's not a dead bone in his body.  Jennings  sees
     himself  as a product of the tacky '70s and the punk anti-culture
     spawned by what he calls "the era of John Travolta,  a time  when
     the emperor's clothes were really off."  Opportunities for men of
     his  generation  seem  to  range from  service-sector  yuppie  to
     marginal  bum.  The  real curiosity about Jennings is How  can  a
     smart  punk  live as a grown-up?  Bright in math and science  but
     somewhat of a "wise-off" in high-school,  Jennings barely managed
     to   graduate  from  what  he  calls  "the  cesspool  of   public
     education."   Just out of the cesspool,  he went to work  in  the
     electronice  industry near his hometown of Woods Hole,  Mass.  In
     the  late '70s,  like other lone nuts with a  catalog,  he  began
     mail-ordering   components   for  his   do-it-yourself   personal
     computer.   Eventullly,   Jennings  developed  his  own  computer
     networking   software,   FidoNET,   which  allowed  him  to  have
     electronic intercourse with people all over the world.

     Fidonews                     Page 5                   13 Apr 1987


            His   software  accomplishments  resulted   in   Jennings'
     nomination for the Andrew Fluegelman Award,  named after the late
     editor of PC World and MacWorld.  He explains that Fluegelman was
     also  a  computer  hobbyist who believed that  computer  software
     should be free.   But,  Jennings added,  some say that Fluegelman
     ended up, at 41, jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge.

            A  year  ago,   Jennings  began  his  late-night  solitary
     glidings  through the streets of San Francisco.   This led to the
     decision  to live by the board rather than die by the  chip.   He
     now works full-time with Shred of Dignity, a skateboarders' union
     formed to fight various ban-theboard crusaders.  His politics are
     a  strange mixture of reverence for organization and distrust  of
     authority and bureaucracy.  In his warehouse digs, just a wheelie
     away  from  Moscone  Center,  the walls  are  covered  with  punk
     graffiti  and Shred of Dignity notices,  yet it seems oddly  neat
     and  organized.   The  handwriting-on-the-wall philosophy  ranges
     from "Skate Free or Die" to "Duke's a Dweeb" to "SFPD:  Skate for
     Pedestrian  Destruction" to "Drugs,  Just Say No."  The House  of
     Jennings  reminds  me that being a grown-up needn't  involve  the
     surrender  to drugery that most of us end up  with.   Of  course,
     being  a  grown-up is a lot more laughs without a job  and  kids.
     In  place of the traditional family,  Jennings finds support from
     the  electronic network and the  skateboarding  community.   Like
     other urban explorers, he sees the skateboard and the computer as
     "guerrilla  technology"  in the battle to survive  with  dignity.
     He  finds friends through skateboarding events and encourages use
     of  the  Shred of Dignity message  phone  (882-9973).   The  tape
     closes  with  the  group's credo:  "Skate until  you  puke."   He
     proudly  shows  me  the Shred of Dignity  Ragazine  (sic).   "Our
     'Zine," he calls it.   It includes a map of the city highlighting
     places to skate and the risks involved (occupational hazards like
     getting  busted  and getting beat up).  One skating  site  - "The
     Dish" - is described in the Ragazine as a concrete object that is
     "great  for skating,  but be prepared to get the hell out at  the
     first  hint of trouble.   Macho bull---- is insane,  be a  wimp."
     Jennings  seeks  out  other likeminded wimps for  his  brave  new
     world.  He  describes his people as  "straight-edge  compatible."
     It's  an attitude,  he explains,  not a lifestyle - whatever that
     means.   The basic components are "don't pollute anything;  drugs
     aren't  revolutionary,  they're  nasty;  we're not  fighting  the
     government, we're not participating in the government."

            Many  in this pit of punk culture are also vegetarian  and
     celibate  -more  evidence for the It's Hip to Be  Square  theory.
     "Some say straight-edge punks are just late-model Puritans," adds
     Jennings.

                            LATE-MODEL PURITANS

            Among  the  favorite pastimes of these modern Puritans  is
     "thrashing," a kink of dancing that Jennings gleefully  describes
     as  "violent."  Participants  are thrown into a pit  packed  with
     people.   It  could  be a metaphor or just a weird thing  to  do.
     Standing 6-foot-4 and cachectically thin, Jennings throws so much
     energy  into  conversation that you can almost see  the  calories
     Fidonews                     Page 6                   13 Apr 1987


     burn  off.  But he becomes most animated when he talks about  the
     animosity  to  skateboarders.   For him,  skateboarding  is  both
     ecologically sound transportaion and a physical way to enjoy "the
     three  dimensions of the city,  the textures of  the  world.   We
     didn't  grow up in the country with outhouses.   The streets  and
     the  concrete  are our natural environment."  This theme  of  the
     lone pioneer finding kinesthetic beauty in the concrete jungle is
     echoed  repeatedly by other rolling poets in the Shred of Dignety
     'Zine.   Writes  one:  "To  the  skater,  CITY is  a  place  with
     unlimited potential,  speed,  slides, bails, broken bones, walls,
     banks,  curbs,  even the grim feeling of swiftly moving  pavement
     along  your thigh."  "I'm also into shooting guns," Jennings adds
     with a wide grin, relishing the shock value of his comment.  "But
     I shoot them purely for fun - not to hurt anybody; not to protect
     myself;  not to kill animals.  Hunting is disgusting.  I was once
     with someone when he shot a seagull.   I was sick for the rest of
     the day."  Tom Jennings can always make a buck if he has to.  And
     he can give it away,  which he has.   This allows him the freedom
     to live his life for the hell of it.  He's a socially responsible
     punk. He also gives great lunch, but I'm glad to be heading home.
     The burden of being the ordinary one is an incredible drag.

     Edward DelGrosso
     Black Bag BBS 126/120

          Late in 1984 I began to search the nations bulletin boards
     in order to create a list of boards specifically related to
     medicine.  That first list had about 5 numbers on it and that
     really took some searching !

          Since that time, health care professionals have really begun
     to take advantage of this powerful new form of communications,
     and now the list consists of over 90 numbers. Fido Net has been
     instrumental in this growth. Although still small in number, the
     sysops of these boards are now publishing their own weekly
     medical newsletter (Thanks to Dave Dodell at 114/15) and with the
     advent of echo mail, conferences have developed on a variety of
     medical topics including AIDS, Social Work, Alcoholism and
     Emergency Medical Services.

          I have submitted the following list of  medical bulletin
     boards to Fido News because I think they are a special resource
     within Fido Net. In addition to being a unique and vital
     medical communications link, these boards offer general users
     access to a wealth of medical information in the form of files,
     programs and on line professionals.

          I'd like to appeal to the Fido Net Community in enhancing
     this list.  It is an important asset which I feel needs to be
     aggressively maintained.  For my part, I've confiiirmed the
     existence of these boards on the dates shown below and will
     continue to do so. I hope any Fido Net users having any
     additions !!!!!, corrections (especially name and baud rate) or
     suggestions would take a few minutes and net mail me the info
     at the address below.

           Finally, I'd like to thank ALL those who have made
     Fido Net possible.  It truly is the wave of the future and I
     congratulate those who have been, and are being so responsible in
     assuring that it evolves in a useful and coherent manner.
     Also, a special thanks has to go to all those medical Fido Net
     sysops who have done a superior job in attempting to help and
     educate society using this new medium.

     Thom Henderson, 107/6.1

                          SEAdog node list problem


     A  bug  has turned up in SEAdog 4.0 when it compiles a very large
     node list.  Some people are hitting it now with the  latest  node
     list  plus private lists,  and everyone will probably hit it when
     the public list gets a little larger.

     Yes,  this is truly a bug,  and we apologize for it.  It shows up
     as  MAILER  hanging when it compiles the node list.  TELL,  SEND,
     and GET can handle a somewhat bigger node list,  and MAIL  should
     be able to handle an even bigger list, but all would get stuck on
     it if given a large enough node list.

     Future  versions  of  SEAdog won't have this particular bug,  but
     that doesn't help much right now.  So to deal with  this  problem
     we've written a program called NLBUG.EXE, which should be able to
     compile  a  node list of any size.  Or at any rate,  we know from
     testing it that it'll properly handle a node list  of  over  5000
     nodes in over 300 nets.  The suggested sequence of events is:

     1) Run XlatList to create NODELIST.BBS

     2) Move NODELIST.BBS to wherever SEAdog normally looks for it.

     3) Run NLBUG.

     4) Delete NODELIST.BBS

     5) Proceed as usual.

     NLBUG will then compile the node list properly.

     To  get a copy of NLBUG,  either file request NLBUG.EXE from node
     107/6, or send us network mail and we'll send you a copy.

                         Pointless Nodelist Hassles


             I just had one of the stupidest experiences in  my  life:
     trying to get a current nodelist. Bear with me.

             I have been away from the IFNA net for a while, but I had
     lots  of  experience with it in the past.  I have a nodelist from
     Oct 86, and want to get a somewhat current one. Easy, right? Dead
     wrong. After over an hour of long distance calls, no luck.

             I tried 1/0,  618-  something.  Said  "loading  Opus...",
     never came back.  (3+ minutes) Tried 1/2, its now 100/22 only, no
     problem with that,  but  no  nodelist.  OK.  Wrote  down  various
     help/bug nodes, modem help, etc.  Called those.  NYC, LA, etc. No
     nodelist files AT ALL!  Not even nodediffs.  Finally  found  some
     stuff on echohelp in NYC?  Dozens of DIFF files,  a few  nodelist
     files, but Opus wouldn't let me list selectively through the 100+
     files  in the area,  and anyway,  the newest nodelist was Jan 87,
     and Id have to get all the DIFFs to bring it up to speed.

             This  is  stupid and absurd.  Can't there be somewhere in
     region 1 that is a small number of places where the nodelist  can
     be found? Like maybe a complete ARC'd nodelist from the beginning
     of  the month plus DIFFs,  or maybe even just a complete nodelist
     every week?

             My experience isn't that unusual,  lots of people get out
     of sync with the diffs, or drop out and come back like I'm trying
     to, or maybe just messed up and want to get cleaned up. DIFFs are
     great,  but  they were supposed to be a time & effort saver,  not
     another bureaucracy. Let's be real folks.

             DIFFs are a waste of time  under  many  conditions,  like
     when  you have to get a number of them to get up to date,  that's
     not what they were meant for. Take a 70K nodelist, add a dozen or
     so DIFF files,  and you have a huge download,  and a complex  and
     error prone XLAT process. Any arguments about disk space, etc are
     a waste of time.  It's just not that big,  and besides, you could
     just not bother  keeping  so  many  old  DIFFs  around.  (If  the
     nodelist complete is say 70K,  then you reach break even when the
     DIFFs total 70K,  right?  To keep a 70K nodelist,  plus dozens of
     DIFFs,  "to save disk space" is silly.  A 70K nodelist,  plus the
     last  months  DIFFs  is  plenty.   The  files  just  aren't  that
     inherently interesting historically.  Maybe someone should keep a
     copy of every one ever made, but not everyone needs to.)

             The nodelist is the life blood of the IFNA net, and if I,
     an  experienced FidoNet sysop,  cannot find a copy then certainly
     relative-novices and other outside people certainly cant.

             The flyer I received in the mail also  doesn't  have  ANY
     phone numbers on it. I realize as well as anyone that BBS numbers
     aren't reliable, but don't the IFNA overhead ones tend to stay up
     for  months  at  a  time?  Like  1/1,  1/0,  etc?  Can't these be
     published with a disclaimer,  and the address "if all else fails,
     Fidonews                     Page 14                  13 Apr 1987


     write  ..."?  It  would probably save a LOT of letters & stamps &
     hassles in answering questions.

             I still don't have a nodelist,  and I don't know what  to
     do, except make more expensive phone calls and hope that 1/0 will
     finally load Opus or something so I can see if the files are even
     there.

             I  think a number of NODELIST NODES in region 1 would fix
     this,  all they have to do is have  the  damn  files  around.  Or
     maybe put it in the comment section, or something.  Just so there
     is some way for someone  like  me  (or  worse  off)  can  find  a
     nodelist!

           [AARRGGHH!!  Stop me!  I feel an article coming on!]

     Every  once in a while,  something happens out there in the  wild
     and  wacky  world of FIDONET that triggers the  creative  juices.
     Usually  I just wipe it off the keyboard.   However,  the  recent
     spate  of repetative messages that have been reverberating around
     the  country in the national echomail conferences  (the  national
     SYSOP  conference  in particular) caused me to put the  following
     thoughts down.   I would have put them into the echo,  but  these
     thoughts  should  be shared with the FIDO community at large  (at
     least I think so, and the FIDONEWS will publish anything).

     The  advent  of electronic mail has opened a wonderful  tool  for
     communications.   In  this microcomputer age,  it is possible  to
     exchange  thoughts (great or not-so-great) on a one-on-one  or  a
     one-on-many basis.   Though the use of echomail conferences,  the
     ability to have many-on-many exchanges exists.   All of these are
     a two-edged sword.  They can be both a panacea and a plague.

     Echomail messages take several forms.   On rare occaisions,  they
     are  private  messages  between two  individuals,  or  groups  of
     individuals  (i.e.  SYSOP to SYSOP).   The latter message type is
     really  public,  as everyone in that "class" has access to  these
     messages.   So  in  a sense,  they are  privledged,  rather  than
     private.   For the most part,  messages in an echomail conference
     are public,  open for response and comment by all participants in
     that echo.

     The  content  of these messages can vary widely,  as  anyone  who
     participates in an echo can verify.  Some are the general "how do
     I  do  this,  or why does my program do this"  question  that  is
     addressed  to  no one in particular.   These  messages  propogate
     accross  the net,  in a manner not unlike the ripples caused by a
     rock  thrown  into a pond.   However,  unlike  the  ripple,  this
     message  can  generate a reply from each and every node  that  it
     passes through.   Because of propogation delays, these replys may
     take  several days to get back to the originator of the  original
     "rock".  And each of these replays also propogates around the net
     in the same fashine.  Soon, you have a very rough surface on this
     otherwise calm pond, as the replies and replies-to-replies bounce
     back  and  forth accross the net.   Eventually the  "pond"  calms
     down,  until someone who has not been read the mails for a while,
     responds to the question, and the entire process begins again.

     In the case of the "REN/RENUM/REN" ripple, the results are rather
     benign.  The responses that have been repeating from almost every
     Fidonews                     Page 16                  13 Apr 1987


     node have been essentially the same.  Everyone seems to be of the
     opinion  that  they  would  be  the only one  to  reply  to  this
     relatively  straight-forward problem.   This is not a bad  thing,
     but  it  is taking up bandwidth (as is  this  article,  which  is
     getting  to be a LOT longer than I thought it would).   In  other
     cases,  it  is interesting to note that everyone seems to have  a
     different opinion about a technical question,  which would appear
     to have a single, correct answer.  It is left up to the reader to
     determine  which  of  the barrage of "feedback" to  the  original
     question is the correct one.  This is also not a bad thing.

     However,  there are other,  nastier, things lurking in the echos.
     Quite often,  an individual will make a statement or  observation
     of  how  "things  seem to me".   Usually,  these  pass  unnoticed
     through the nets.  However, occaisionally they trigger a reaction
     that  can be very ugly.   A recipient of the message will  decide
     that  not  only  does the sender have no right  to  express  this
     opinion,  but  the recipient will make sure that  the  originator
     never  is  foolish enough to again clutter the bandwidth with  an
     opinion that is contrary their own outlook on life,  the universe
     and  other things (wow,  that was a close one!).   The  resulting
     flamage,  results in severe cluttering of the net,  with personal
     attacks  that  are  senseless,  pointless,  redundant,  immature,
     vindictive  and in some cases potentially libelous.   We see  the
     ugly  head of the "you can express your opinion,  as long  as  it
     agrees with mine" beast rearing up over the keyboard.   Usually a
     single  message will result in a bararge of abuse,  usually  from
     individuals who are well known for their writing styles.   Often,
     they  succeed  in  their objective,  and the  originator  of  the
     message  is beaten into submission and will seldome venture  into
     the  echos  to express another opinion.   In  other  cases,  they
     succeed in driving these valuable individuals to giving up on the
     echos and fidonet.  Those of us who have been at this for a while
     have  seen  this  happen.   And  it is not  limited  to  echomail
     conferences  over FIDONET.   I have seen the same type  of  thing
     happen accros USENET, which has a much broader user base.

     So,  what  is  my point?  (This article has gotten out of  hand!)
     Electronic mail in the form of echomail conferences can be a two-
     edged sword.   It can be used for a creative purpose, such as the
     solving of technical and non-technical problems,  the sharing  of
     information,  or  just communicating with a fellow communications
     addict  via the keyboard and screen.   It can also be used  in  a
     very  destructive manner to put down,  to ridicule,  to  lie,  to
     slander,  to  confuse,  to  generate disinformation  or  generate
     apathy.   There are a lot of individuals of both types out there.
     There  is a little of both in each of us.   The final decision as
     to whether we use this electronic blade as a tool for progress or
     a weapon of destruction is in our own hands.   As Pogo once  said
     "We have met the enemy, and it is us."  The ultimate choice as to
     where we head as a network, is in OUR hands.

     =================================================================


          Things have  gone well this past week. I stopped by my local
     dealer and  he was  very busy.  He was due to give a seminar at a
     computer show  in the  area and didn't have the time to learn how
     to use the software, and he wanted to give a demonstration during
     the seminar.  I offered  to help  him out,  and as a result got a
     chance to  play with the latest in Desktop Publishing software. I
     had some time to look around the show and am happy to report that
     Springboard is  taking Certificate  Maker seriously,  at least  I
     found someone selling the first library disk of certificates. The
     new disks  also include several new border styles as well as over
     one hundred  new certificates.  Other than that there wasn't much
     else at  the show,  although I  was seriously  tempted to  buy  a
     laptop computer  that was  on sale  (I hate  myself later  when I
     empty my  checking account at these shows). Thanks to the money I
     made giving  the demonstration  at the  seminar, I  have  ordered
     ATI's EGA  Wonder which is a sort of Swiss Army knife among video
     cards and  will be  letting you  know how  it works  out in a few
     weeks.

     -- PageMaker (Aldus corp. list price $695.00) --

          Those of you who are fans of PageMaker on the Macintosh will
     be pleased  to hear  that it  works the  same on  the PC.  The PC
     version of  PageMaker runs  under Windows,  so  any  monitor  and
     printer that  Windows understands  will run  PageMaker fine.  The
     only catch  is that  Windows is SLOW! I tried running it on an XT
     initially and  eventually gave up because of the delays. On an AT
     the speed  is bearable,  and it probably wouldn't even be noticed
     on  a   386  machine.   The  speed  problem  is  due  to  Windows
     multitasking capabilities,  if your  machine runs  Windows at  an
     acceptable speed  you shouldn't have any problems with PageMaker.
     There's a  whole list  of software  that the  PC version can work
     with for  text and  pictures, and  I will say it did read my text
     files  created  with  Word,  WordPerfect  and  Wordstar.  In  the
     graphics department  all I  got it  to read  in was Windows Paint
     pictures and  Lotus PIC  images.  It  is  supposedly  capable  of
     bringing in  drawings from AutoCad and some other programs, but I
     didn't have any of the other one's around.

          I found  it exceptionally  easy to  move my  text around the
     pages although at first it seemed odd to divide the page into six
     different sections  each containing part of one of my columns. My
     only complaint  on  it's  text  capabilities  is  that  the  text
     wouldn't flow  around my  pictures to  easily. In  order to get a
     picture to  fill half a column I had to divide my text into three
     different parts; the part above the picture, the part next to the
     picture and  the part below the picture. I would have liked it if
     things had  been a little easier for something like this. Another
     nice extra  is that PageMaker automatically determined which word
     processor had  been used  when it  read  in  my  text,  the  only
     exception was  I had  to "tell" it when I was reading in straight
     Fidonews                     Page 19                  13 Apr 1987


     ASCII. The  editing capabilities  within  PageMaker  are  nothing
     fantastic, although  they would  be more  than adequate to make a
     few last minute changes.

          Manipulating the graphics images wasn't as easy as the text.
     Those of  you familiar  with  the  Macintosh  version  may  enjoy
     PageMaker's methods  for cropping  a  picture,  but  I  found  it
     slightly clumsy to my way of working. This isn't to say that they
     aren't extremely  capable, once  I got  used to  how it worked it
     wasn't that  bad. It's just that it isn't as instinctive to me as
     the rest  of the program, and I was never able to get the text to
     flow around  a picture  as easily as I'd like. The other newcomer
     into the  PC Desktop  Publishing arena did things a little better
     in this department.

     -- Ventura Publisher (Xerox corp. list price $895.00) --

          Ventura  Publisher  is  Xerox's  bid  into  the  PC  Desktop
     Publishing market  and this one really blew my mind! First off it
     runs under GEM instead of Windows. While I am not really a fan of
     either of these two operating environments, GEM beats Windows any
     day. Mainly  because GEM  doesn't suffer from the delusion that a
     PC or  XT can  be a  good multitasking  system so  it runs  a lot
     quicker. Also  since software  manufactures can  get a  run  time
     version of GEM, you don't have to buy GEM in order to use Ventura
     (you have to buy Windows if you want to run PageMaker). While you
     don't get  the full  GEM operating environment, Ventura runs fine
     and you  don't have  to do  any extra  work when you exit it (you
     have to  exit Windows  after exiting  PageMaker). While PageMaker
     costs less  than Ventura, keep in mind that you've got the hidden
     cost in  PageMaker that  you don't  have with  Ventura (so  don't
     write me  telling me  how  PageMaker  costs  so  much  less  than
     Ventura). For those of you unfamiliar with a run-time library (or
     "program" in  this case) what it means is that Xerox can give you
     the necessary  part of GEM in order to use their product and they
     just pay  Digital Research so much for every copy of Ventura they
     sell. Aldus  can't do  the  same  thing  with  PageMaker  because
     Microsoft doesn't  have a run-time version of Windows, you either
     have it or you don't.

          Ventura matches  PageMaker's text  editing  capabilities  in
     every department  and destroys  it  because  Ventura  uses  style
     sheets. A  style sheet  is one of the things that makes Ventura a
     lot better than PageMaker in my book, it allows you to define the
     characteristics (justification,  size, type  face, etc.)  of  any
     paragraph of  text. If  you're doing  a magazine  type layout you
     might have a particular way you want a liftout to look (a liftout
     is those  few lines of text that publisher's take out of the text
     and turn  into big  bold letters that stand out from the text and
     either catch  your eye or annoy you depending on what mood you're
     in). In  Ventura you'd  merely define  what a liftout should look
     like, click  on the  paragraph that  should be  "lifted-out," and
     click on  your liftout definition (when "categorizing" paragraphs
     all your defined styles appear in box to the left of the screen).
     If you're  looking over  the text for the first time it's just as
     easy to  mark the  text that  should be  a liftout,  copy  it  to
     Fidonews                     Page 20                  13 Apr 1987


     wherever you  want the liftout and then mark it as such. All this
     made Ventura  an utter  joy to  use. I can't emphasize enough how
     easy style sheets made it when creating a document. While Ventura
     only comes  with 21 different style sheets, you can modify any of
     them or create totally new ones.

          Ventura beats  PageMaker hands  down when  in comes to image
     pictures in  my book.  Some of  the  image  pictures  from  other
     programs it  can use are PC Paintbrush, GEM paint, and supposedly
     anything from  a Microtek  Dest image  scanner. I  found it  much
     easier to  enlarge and  shrink the pictures, and the cropping was
     much more  powerful AND easier to use. You can set the sizing and
     scaling in  a few  keystrokes, and  crop the  image  within  it's
     frame. I  should mention  that everything  in Ventura  goes in  a
     frame, if no other frame is specified the background page becomes
     the frame.  Border's around  pictures became a snap, and it would
     allow a  border to  be made  up of  as many  as 3  lines with you
     controlling the  thickness of  each line  and the spacing between
     each of  them. Captions to pictures were just as easy and you can
     easily move  them from  either side  of the  picture or above and
     below. You  are also  capable of squeezing a lot into the caption
     and controlling how much space is set aside for it.

          With line  art (as Ventura calls it) you can import pictures
     from AutoCAD  (although once  again I  wasn't able to really test
     this), almost  any of  the GEM  programs (GEM  Graph,  GEM  Draw,
     etc.), Lotus  1-2-3 PIC  files and  Symphony picture files (might
     even handle Framework if Framework generates a "standard" picture
     file). I  know it  can handle  AutoCAD because  of  some  of  the
     samples included  with Ventura, mainly the nozzle picture and the
     picture of  the Space Shuttle which I have seen being manipulated
     using AutoCAD.  One of the nice things you can do with Ventura is
     add some  text to  a picture  and then  make an arrow pointing to
     from your  text to  part of  the drawing.  I used  this to make a
     comment on  a graph  and actually  point to  that section  of the
     graph. On line art you can't do very much in the way of cropping,
     but you are capable of resizing it up to a full page.

          Let me point out that Ventura is NOT a good drawing program.
     It's capabilities in that department are minimal, mainly just add
     a small  box of  text and  draw lines, circles, and boxes. If you
     plan on  doing much  "free hand"  drawing, you'll  want a  decent
     paint (or  drawing) program like PC Paintbrush. This shouldn't be
     a problem  since you  would probably be using a word processor to
     generate the initial text and either a scanner, paint program, or
     drawing program  (or CAD  program) to create the individual parts
     of a document and just bring them all together using Ventura.

          Printer support in Ventura is pretty decent. They've covered
     most  of   the  laser   printers  out   there   (mainly   through
     compatibility to  the HP  laser printers and PostScript) although
     dot matrix  wise you'd  need something  that's compatible with an
     Epson. An  unusual capability  is the Xerox color printer, if you
     have either  that or  a color  printer compatible with it you can
     print in  up to  eight different  colors. The catch is you really
     need a  PostScript printer  to take  full  advantage  of  a  wide
     Fidonews                     Page 21                  13 Apr 1987


     variety  of  different  type  styles  and  sizes.  Is  there  any
     PostScript printers  out there  besides the  Apple  LaserWriter's
     (excluding the  professional typesetting equipment)? If so please
     let me  know about  them, it's a shame that only one company will
     support  what   is  bound   to  become  a  standard  since  IBM's
     announcement (yes, IBM is now officially endorsing PostScript).

          That's about all on the hot new software I promised I'd look
     at last  week. I  didn't intend  it to  run on for so long, but I
     just had  to write about it while my memory was still fresh. If I
     had to  choose between  PageMaker and Ventura right now, I'd have
     to say  go with  Ventura. It  seems to have a lot more capability
     than PageMaker,  and I  think it's  worth the  extra bucks (which
     isn't that much after you toss Windows into PageMaker). Maybe one
     of these  days I'll  have the  money to buy one of these products
     (and a  PostScript printer) and I'll be able to give you a better
     run down on them. Until then, this is going to have to do.

     -- Winding Down.. --

          Best game  I've had a chance to play with this week has been
     EMPIRE, which  is available  on many bulletin board systems. It's
     you against  the computer  in taking  over a  world. After  a few
     hours I  was able  to beat  the computer at the easy level and in
     setting out to explore the world I gained a lot of insight in the
     logistic problems of today's armies. You start out with one town,
     and every  town you  control can  produce  one  "product"  be  it
     armies, planes,  various types  of  ships,  etc.  Each  town  you
     capture will  also produce something for you. In trying to manage
     several cities,  you could  get bogged  down in  the commands  to
     every troop, plane, and ship. Thankfully you can "automate" a lot
     of your commands like telling an army to just roam the continent.
     I've had  quite a  bit of  fun with  it, and  like  HACK  it  was
     initially written for a UNIX type machine so just about everybody
     out there can run it.

          Best book this month goes to "Using PC DOS" by Chris DeVoney
     (QUE books,  $21.95). It  would make  an excellent  supplement to
     Learning MS-DOS  which I  commented on  a few  weeks ago.  It has
     sections in  it for both the beginner and more advanced users and
     covers the topics well. Some of the topics include how to prepare
     diskettes, managing  DOS directories,  and what a RAM disk is and
     how to  use it.  It will  probably become a well worn book in the
     next few months in my own library (from loaning it out to friends
     who are just beginning if nothing else).

          Next column I should get around to looking at the new SEAdog
     (originally meant  to write  about it in this column, sorry Thom)
     and a  nice database  program I  found on  a local  board. I once
     again welcome  your comments on my column. I'd especially like to
     hear from  you if  you think  I should  look  over  any  specific
     products (hardware  or software).  If you're a user of a bulletin
     board please mention to your sysop that mail to me must be routed
     through either  157/0, 157/502,  or 157/1  , and sysops just take
     note of  this sentence. All of those nodes are running SEAdog and
     will take  mail (and  files) to  be forwarded to me anytime. I'll

                Tandy User Group Newsletter.... March, 1987
                    PC MAGAZINE REVIEWS TANDY COMPUTERS

       Earlier this week,  several Tandy executives attended the "1987
     PC Forum" in Scottsdale,  Arizona.  PC Magazine publisher William
     Lohse and Editor Bill Machrone made it a  point  to  tell  Graham
     Beachum  and/or  me,  how  well  they  think  we're  doing in the
     marketplace,  and how highly they regard our MS-DOS product line.
     Too bad they don't write the reviews in their magazine!

       When we returned to Fort Worth,  we found the March 31 issue of
     PC,  with reviews on the Tandy 1000 EX,  1000  SX,  and  3000  HL
     computers.  The reviewer obviously didn't share their enthusiasm.
     But... neither did he understand or have accurate facts about the
     machines he reviewed.

       We won't argue with a reviewer who forms his negative  opinions
     based on fact,  but these reviews weren't in that category.  I'll
     say that the reviewer obviously didn't understand the 1000 EX and
     its positioning as an entry-level home  and  school  product.  He
     tried to measure it by office standards... the need for IBM board
     compatibility,  the  lack of hard disk capability,  etc.  I would
     suggest that it actually is a computer capable of running IBM  PC
     software,  at  a  price  most  people  would  expect to pay for a
     computer principally intended for entertainment.

          That  said,   I  will  try  to  overlook  his  opinion-based
     statements  and  address  some  of  the  half-truths and outright
     errors...

      1) The EX was panned for lack of expandability,  and it was said
         we  offer "640K RAM expansion and a 300/1200-baud modem." The
         impression left was that only two boards are available.  Fact
         - we offer seven...  the RAM,  a 300-baud modem,  a 1200-baud
         modem, RS-232, mouse/clock board,  Network 4 card,  and STB's
         new EX Chauffeur display adapter. More are coming.

      2) Of  both  the  EX and SX,  the reviewer said our video signal
         timing is so far off the IBM standard that the 25th  line  of
         the  display disappears behind the monitor bezel of non-Tandy
         monitors.  Fact - ours are  220-line  monitors,  while  IBM's
         display 200 vertical lines. There is a MODE 200 command which
         may  be keyed in or put in an AUTOEXEC.BAT file to compensate
         if you're using a non-Tandy monitor.

      3) The EX was described as "...  a moderate performer,  yielding
         nowhere  near  the  double speed its fast clock would imply."
         Fact -7.16 Mhz is 50% faster than 4.77 Mhz,  not  double.  We
         claim a 20% throughput gain, which is exactly what PC found.

      4) "The EX's 4.77 Mhz speed was even more disappointing, at best
         10  percent  slower  than the standard IBM time." Fact - With
         256K RAM,  the video refresh is interleaved.  When you expand
         beyond  256K,  video RAM is re-positioned,  and refresh is no
     Fidonews                     Page 24                  13 Apr 1987


         longer interleaved. Speed should at least equal the IBM.

      5) "For anyone accustomed to the IBM standard,  the EX  keyboard
         is  a  terror."  By  the  time  he  reached the SX,  the same
         keyboard was "Both compelling and confounding.  The touch  is
         positive,  with  both  audible and "tactile feedback." Fact -
         it's the same keyboard that received raves on the Tandy 2000.
         Absolute keyboard cloning is hardly a major issue to a  first
         time  user.  Our  "enhanced keyboard",  an exact duplicate of
         IBM's "enhanced keyboard" (except for indicator lights),  can
         be  adapted to the SX for those with a need for key placement
         compatibility.

      6) Personal DeskMate was described  as  "...  all  the  software
         you'll  need--until  you  discover how much better commercial
         programs can  be."  Fact  -  it's  furnished  free  with  the
         computer.  It's  an  entry-level program designed to give the
         user immediate utility  and  the  ease  of  use  provided  by
         Microsoft  Windows  conventions.  There  was  no intention or
         claim  that   DeskMate   replaces   hi-level,   full-featured
         applications  packages.  We hope introducing new users to the
         concepts involved,  will allow them to make a  more  informed
         choice of full-featured, megabuck "commercial programs", when
         they're ready.

      7) "... the 1000 EX will not run PC-DOS 3.2." Fact - the 1000 EX
         absolutely  runs  PC-DOS  3.2.  (It obviously won't run IBM's
         BASIC,  since part of IBM's BASIC is and always has  been  in
         ROM. Could this be what confused the reviewer?)

      8) "...the  1000  EX has severe limitations.  The worst of these
         are proprietary expansion, no provision for a hard disk,  and
         its   odd   keyboard."  Fact  -  most  entry-level  users  or
         "homework" users, will need video, a printer, and the ability
         to expand to 640K.  They'll transport their work on floppies,
         hardly  on hard disks.  And to my knowledge,  all the popular
         software is still delivered  on  floppies...  Lotus,  Ashton-
         Tate,  Microsoft, etc.  If your needs are greater, you should
         be looking at a 1000 SX anyway.

      9) "You must buy a special Tandy adapter cable to  tie  in  your
         parallel   printer."  Fact  -  We  use  an  industry-standard
         parallel I/O... there's no adapter involved. Yes, you have to
         buy a printer cable -- regardless of the computer you choose.

     10) The Tandy 1000 SX is described as a "stripped down though not
         unlikable machine." Fact  -  The  SX  comes  with  384K,  two
         drives,   faster   clock,   dual  speed  processor,   printer
         interface,  monochrome and color  video  interface,  graphics
         capability,  composite  and RGBI outputs,  sound,  line-level
         audio output, light pen port, two joystick ports, an 8087 co-
         processor socket,  and five open  PC-compatible  slots  (even
         with 640K RAM on board.) And,  it's supplied with DOS, BASIC,
         and DeskMate II.  Maybe I'm getting subjective,  but I'd sure
         like  him  to  tell me when a computer ceases to be "stripped
         down."
     Fidonews                     Page 25                  13 Apr 1987


     11) "The standard MS-DOS 2.11 operating system  of  the  1000  SX
         allows  access  to  a huge library of PC-Compatible programs.
         Yet the machine does have its  incompatibilities.  Like  many
         older  compatibles,  it  will not run PC-DOS 3.2." Fact - not
         only does it run PC-DOS 3.2, but it is supplied standard with
         MS-DOS 3.2, not 2.11 as stated.

     12) On both the EX and SX,  memory benchmark tests were  not  run
         "because  of  insufficient memory." We'd have been most happy
         to send additional memory,  had it been requested.  We supply
         reviewers with any configuration they ask for. Had the memory
         been  installed,  the video memory change would probably have
         resulted in better numbers for all the tests.

     13) In a chart  on  page  168,  parallel  ports  were  listed  as
         optional  on  both  the  1000 EX and 1000 SX.  Fact - They're
         standard... built right onto the motherboard.

     14) Same chart shows expansion slots for the EX as  "none".  Fact
         - The EX has one proprietary slot. Our memory expansion card,
         when  plugged  into that slot,  provides two additional "plus
         slots" for two more option boards.

     15) The review of the 3000 HL says it has seven slots, three "XT-
         style 8-bit" and four "full AT-style 16-bit." Fact -  reverse
         the numbers and you have it... four XT and three AT slots.

       Don't  get  me  wrong...  I  know  the  senior executives at PC
     magazine,  and have great respect for them and their publication.
     This is a commentary on three Tandy reviews, nothing more.

       Less  than  two days after the review reached us,  there was at
     least one message thread, about the inaccuracies, on CompuServe's
     Tandy forums.  I believe it is appropriate that  we  should  take
     this avenue -- about the most timely one open to us -- to set the
     record straight. I have asked PC Magazine's publisher what can be
     done to set the record straight with his readers.

                          LARGEST MODEL 100 CLUB ?

       I had a call this week from Rick Hansen of "Club 100",  a Model
     100 user group which claims to be the  largest.  Rick  reports  a
     membership  of  about  600 people.  Can anyone top that?  In case
     you'd like more information,  the  address  is  P.O.  Box  23438,
     Pleasant Hill, CA 94523. They have a BBS, too... (415)939-1246.

                                   MOUSES

       Or  "mice"  or  whatever you prefer.  We've had a few questions
     recently about the discontinuing of our 26-1197  Digi-Mouse.  No,
     we're  not abandoning these little critters.  Currently,  we have
     the Logitech Mouse in our Express Order system (Cat. No.  90-2055
     for 25-pin, 90-2056 for 9-pin).  They will replace our Digi-Mouse
     as  a store-stocked item in the second quarter of this year,  and
     can be ordered from Express Order between now and then.

                          TANDY 1000 DOCUMENTATION

       Many Tandy computer buyers are novice computer users  in  every
     sense  of  the  word.  One  of the most frightening things to any
     first-time computer user,  is to be confronted by a  mountain  of
     documentation.  That's  why  we  elected  to  hold the "standard"
     documentation down to a minimum.  We tried to include just enough
     to get those first-time users up and running  with  off-the-shelf
     applications packages or DeskMate.

       We  firmly  believe our decision was absolutely right for those
     first-time users. That's the good news. The bad news is the folks
     among you who are quite computer-literate felt short changed.

       First off,  let me assure you that you got what you  paid  for.
     Had  we  included  detailed documentation on MS-DOS and GW-BASIC,
     the cost of the computer would have  increased  a  bit.  And  for
     those of you who want that documentation,  there is an MS-DOS/GS-
     BASIC reference manual available... Cat. No.  25-1508, $29.95.

       It's a question that comes up often at user group meetings,  so
     I thought maybe you'd like to know our reasoning.

                             HARD DRIVE OWNERS

       Our  merchandising  department  would  like to alert hard drive
     owners to a potential problem area that doesn't have  to  be.  It
     has to do with hard drive formatting. From personal experience, I
     can assure you it will cause trouble.

       When you format your hard drive, you must enter the "bad track"
     information that is supplied with your drive.  If you don't,  you
     can have failures which will look exactly like hardware glitches.
     Be sure you enter this information any time you format.

       The media error map should  be  taped  to  the  bottom  of  the
     computer  or external hard drive case.  If yours was installed by
     our service center,  it may be taped to  the  top  of  the  drive
     itself.

        That's about it for now... see you next month.
