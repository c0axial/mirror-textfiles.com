        Yes, the newsletter is late. Once again.

        I had to reject a couple of newslatter articles
cause I could not handle the text format I was supplied.
Most, though, are just fine, and many thanks to the people
who gave me text files I can use without manual editing. 

        I have semi-smart software that can reformat
paragraphs from almost any editor, but the problem is tables
of items get destroyed in the process. In the past, I edited
them manually, but it's something like half an hour a piece.

             ARTICLE SUBMISSION

        All articles you see in this issue are written by
users and sysops, and have one way or another managed to
consume disk space on Fido #1. In order to get rid of them,
and free up my precious disk space, I include them here,
then quickly delete them. Then they are YOUR problem.

EDITORIAL CONTENT:

        Totally up to you; I publish anything at all.
Article are generally Fido or BBS related; this is by no
means a decision on my part, nor a requirement.

FOR SALE, WANTED, NOTICES:

        Pretty much self explanatory. Commercial ads are
welcomed, if of reasonable length. These will be run each
issue, or until I lose them. (Dont laugh, Ive already lost a
few.)

SUBMITTING AN ARTICLE:

        Manage to get a copy of your article to Fido #1,
preferably by Fidonet mail, or by uploading. If manual
upload, please put it in the MAILFILE area, so that I can
find them all at once.

ARTICLE FORMAT: VERY IMPORTANT! PLEASE READ!

        The requirements are a little tighter in this
department, due to purely practical constraints. I cannot
devote hours to converting every text format in the world to
the one I use.

1.      NO LEFT MARGINS! Flush left please. These are
        extremely difficult to remove. 

2.      RIGHT MARGIN AT COLUMN 60 OR LESS! Less is OK,
        more is definitely not. This includes fancy 
        boxes, dotted lines, etc.

3.      KEEP FUNNY CONTROL CHARACTERS TO A MINIMUM!
        This includes formfeeds and other oddities.
        These areent as dificult to handle, but on long
        files still takes a while.

4.      WORDSTAR IS FINE IF THERE ARE NO LEFT MARGINS!

5.      PLAIN ASCII (EDLIN, ED, etc) IS FINE IF LINE LENGTH
        IS UNDER 60 COLUMNS!

6.      NO GRAPHIC CHARACTERS! Believe it or not, not every
        one in the world has an IBM PC. My computer 
        understands printable characters from 20 hex to

        7e hex. (Space to tilde) This is ASCII; "American 
        Standard Code for Information Interchange". We are
        "Interchanging Information". Everything else is 
        GARBAGE. ASCII is universal; Graphics are not.

7.      TOTAL ARTICLE LENGTH: Up to you; note, however, that
        I will probably avoid publishing dictionaries, 
        bibles translated into NAPLPS, and ASCII encoded
        LANDSAT pictures of Russian wheat farms.

8.      WHERE ON EARTH IS THIS ARTICLE FROM? Well ... good
        question! A good idea to identify yourself
        somewhere, unless you wish to remain anonymous. 
        Thats OK too, but I may balk at publishing rude 
        or otherwise racy submissions.

9.      AN EXAMPLE:

Article from Tom Jennings
Fido #1 4 Feb 85

        Here is what an article could look like for
submission. Very simple: plain old dumb ASCII, WordStar,
PMATE, Vedit, or whatever. WordStar Document mode is fine.
Note no left column; that is done when FidoNews is
published. Note the total width is only 60 columns; it looks
narrow on your screen, but fine when formatted later.


        END irrational tirade on text files ... on to bigger
and better things!



  I figured out that what I initially interpreted as a
security breach was  really just Fido protecting me.  I use
my name for my sign on with Sysop level  priveleges.  I
found a private message to 'Sysop' from 'Allen Miller' which
I  knew I did not enter.  My first thought was that someone
had gotten or guessed  my password and would have had full
access to the system.  I reviewed the  callers log and did
not see a sign on with my name at or around the time that 
this message was recorded.  I do not give access to the Name
change command to  normal users, even though Fido should not
let them change to a name that  already exists.  

After this initial panic, it finally dawned on me.  There is
a way that a  user can enter a private message to the sysop
without having their name  entered in the SYSOP.LOG file. 
It's the 'forgotten password' routine.  Three  More ? 
incorrect guesses at a password, and they are taken directly
to 'enter a  private message to sysop'.  

Sooooooooo, everything is safe once again.  Even though
someone was able to  create a message from me, 'Allen
Miller', they were not on the system with my  privelege
level as I had initially feared.  Just wanted to share this

with you.  

Allen Miller Fido 85NetWare Column #2 3-Feb-85 

Last time, I proposed a network wide software development
project, in particular, a tool to transform datasets of
popular micro (and mini) computer software packages
between each other. 

There are three major factors that influence the potential
success of such a project.  The first is the precision of
the initial design.  Assuming we all agree on the target
(disagreement is welcome!), in future issues, I will
present some of my ideas on the overall design, as well as
those that hopefully will be pouring in from FidoLand.  In
general, I believe it will take weeks or months to arrive
at a precise specification of any of these projects,
longer on this first one. 

The second major factor is choice of tools.  At an obvious
level, this means development language(s).  There are a
wide variety of choices.  MicroSoft Basic comes to mind. 
Assembler does too, but we should try for at least an
appearance of planning for the future, and non-PC's. 
Turbo Pascal would be my choice.  If this is used, should
the Toolbox be used as well? 

There are sound arguments for using the MS development
family - that way everyone can use the language of their
choice (so long as its in the family). There are
ramifications to such a choice.  The central site (more
later) would have to have all the appropriate compilers,
or act on faith that the source matched the objects
provided by contributors.  Another question is that of
royalties (last time I asked, there were some when using
MS-Basic compiled stuff.) 

For that matter, it should be possible to implement some
or all of such a translator in FrameWork or Symphony
itself (although it would run slowly, and could not 
succeed as a public domain project.  You'd have to own 
Framework or Symphony ... kinda defeats the purpose.) 

Just as important but far less obvious is the selection of
design documentation maintenance tools.  It is ironic we
have to consider this; if the project is successful, we
will have a transformer to render the issue moot! 
However, for now, we have to decide what the form of our
design documents will be.  Not just in the logical form,
or the physical appearance, but the tools used to produce
same.  My preference would be a high level text tool, such
as Framework or ThinkTank.  However, such tools cannot be
assumed. About the most that should be is a word
processor, and possibly text output processor standard. 
Should the specs be maintained using Wordstar, which I
neither own nor intend to own?  Or should we "be true to
our school" and use PC-Write or DVEd or sumpin similar? 







fidonews     --           19 Feb 85  20:25:58           Page 6

Or should the documents just be simple ASCII text files? 
If this is the case, do we have carriage return (and
possibly line feeds) to indicate lines or paragraphs?  You
get the point ... and we have not even considered headings
and subheadings and page numbering, etc. 

A third aspect of the choice of tools is the use of style
of their use.  Under almost any conditions, I would rather
have a copiously documented, albeit inefficient MS Basic
program than a totally uncommented assembly language
program.  Before I dropped out, UMass professors taught me
that a well documented program with bugs is worth more
than an undocumented one that runs.   The former, you can
fix now, and later, when you will inevitably change it.
The latter you can do neither to.  What stylistic
standards should we use, and how do we handle
contributions not meeting any of the standards we
establish? (One solution might be to have two releases -
the frozen and official one, and one which is "beta test",
including modules that do not come up to snuff.) 

The final major consideration is the control of the "true"
product.  Any public domain product with source provided
undergoes mutation.  That's the whole point, hopefully the
mutations will be improvements.  In this particular
product, mutation (in the form of added tool support) is a
planned part of the growth.  There must be a careful
control of the "official master" sources and
specifications, and a method for "checking in and out"
modules.  Another function of such a center is the testing
of the new integrations, and distribution of same.  This 
testing is not as easy as it sounds, for reasons similar 
to the use of variant development languages ... the 
testor(s) will have to have each of the transformed tools, 
or an elaborate project wide testing mechanism will have 
to be designed.  (The latter will probably be the case.  
It will involve the construction of worst case datasets by 
the owners of the individual tools, which will be 
submitted with the master code.)

The distribution of new versions will get to be an
expensive proposition, and a difficult one.  There are a
number of projects going on the net that involve what I
refer to as "publication" functions.  These include the
newsletter, and the distribution of the routing
information weekly.  There is also a library project under
discussion (which seems a great idea that will also clog
the net). 

The ability to send a file once to a local host, and then
have it distributed to one or more of the Fido's served by
that host is essential both for the success of this
project, and the ability of the net to handle publication
class without clogging out message class traffic. 


Last time, we got our first comment.  It was from the

editor, regarding the technical quality of Kermit.  What
Tom said may or may not be true; however, the point was
that Kermit is successful because it covers a wider
variety machines than any public domain comm tool, and
nearly all proprietary packages.  (If you go by my
criteria, which is diversity, there are only two packages
I know of that even think about Kermit's range: Blast and
Poly-XFer.)  This ability in turn was due to the fact that
people intimately familiar with the particular machines
took the generic Kermit spec and did an implementation. 
Kermit is useful to our shop because I can transfer data
between any of the diverse machines we use.  There might
be some vagaries, but by and large, it works, especially
under the direct link conditions we tend to use it.  This
is more valuable to us than a tool that transfers
"perfectly" between a more limited range of machines.

This same general goal is one I have for this project. 
For instance, I am much more concerned with the ability to
transfer data between a wide variety of spreadsheets than
I am to be able to transfer the equations.  I would like
to transfer the equations, and it is a longer term goal of
the project to do so as well.  We will design the beast in
such away to allow future perfection in each of the
particular transforms, but for now, a bunch of minimal
implementations is more useful to the project.  (It gets
more people involved, and gets results quicker, which will
get more people involved.) 

If what Tom says about Kermit's technical deficiencies is
true (and I have no reason to doubt him, although it is
known he does not like the C implementation of Kermit a
whet!), the problem was in the initial design, not the
specific implementations.  The point to this project is to
go the Kermit development project one better.  In that
project, the implementation development  was distributed.
In these, the design can be as well.  How successful this
is is up to you the reader. You the participant. 


Next time, I will present my overall ideas on the
structure of the conversion tool, and hopefully, some of
your ideas on this, or other potential net-wide projects.

Fido and AT&T 6300 + Prometheus 1200 Modem From Justin
Marquez, SysOp Fido 60 - Artichoke - Houston,TX

     Using Fido on the AT&T is very easy.  Pretend your AT&T 
is  an  IBM and truck on into BBS-land.  Now that  the  AT&T 
matter is out of the way, let's go on to the fun part....

     The Prometheus ProModem 1200 is a fine modem,  offering 
all   of  the  Hayes'  Smartmodem  command  set  and   more. 
Unfortunately,  you'll have to perform a partial lobotomy on 
the ProModem for Fido's benefit.  (You can get up now;  said 
lobotomy  is temporary.  All 10 of the Prometheus'  switches 
are  accessible  from the outside,  so setting or  resetting

isn't  a hassle.  ) Set Prometheus' switches as follows  for 
Fido use one of these as a starting point : 

Switch Number     Setting  (Alternate Setting)
 -------------     -------  ------------------- 
1              ON        ON 
2              ON        ON 
3              ON        ON 
4              ON        OFF 
5              OFF       ON 
6              ON        ON 
7              OFF       ON 
8              OFF       ON 
9              ON        ON 
10             OFF       OFF

     I  have  used both settings as a  test,  and  they  are 
workable.  Note  the  Switches #3 and #9 are the ones  which 
turn  the  Prometheus Promodem 1200 into an  ordinary  Hayes 
1200  when  they are ON.  In the OFF  position,  they  allow 
automatic  re-dialing from within the MODEM's  control  (not 
nice  for Fido use !!) and allow an extended message set  to 
be  in effect (BUSY,  WILL RE-DIAL IN 30 SECONDS.....) which 
would probably confuse poor Fido, smart though he may be.

     Use  128/V  as  the CD-Bit Switch,  and  use  the  same 
FIDOMDM.BBS file as recommended for the Hayes 1200B,  if you 
insist on using a FIDOMDM.BBS file at all.  I nearly gave up 
on  the  Pro1200 for Fido use,  until I discovered I  had  a 
"custom" RS-232 cable,  inherited from the previous occupant 
of this computer (IBM at the office, not the AT&T). I bought 
the Pro1200 for home use, as I'm broke all the time, and was 
trying  to save money with the Pro1200.  When I  plugged  it 
into the office machine to try out, it worked with EVERTHING 
except  Fido.  When I got an AT&T for the home use,  I tried 
out all the software I had access to on it,  including Fido. 
And  lo and behold,  it worked flawlessly.  Being a  curious 
sort,  I brought the Pro1200 and cable from the house to the 
office,  and that combo worked on the IBM-PC at the  office! 
Of course, I've always had to use 32/V for the PC, so I knew 
something was kinky. Anybody want a STRANGE cable.........

From: Mark Welch, San Francisco
          via Fido #104, BYTEnet_Listings, Peterborough, NH
To:   Sysops with high FidoNet node numbers

I've been operating a private "test node" Fido and made a
discovery which may be of interest to other FidoNet users,
especially newer Sysops who have a relatively high node number.
 
Now that there are almost 200 nodes, having your number at the
end of the NODELIST causes a delay every time Fido tries to
figure out who is sending or receiving a particular piece of
mail. I was sending mail from my test fido, whose number was
at the end of the list, to Fido just being brought up, whose
"fake" number was at the end of the list. Fido would say

"Message 123 from Mark Welch on Fido1102,<long, long delay>
WelchNet, SF"
and then "To: John Smith on Fido 3000, <long, long delay>
Revap_Data, Keene...NH"
  
To fix this -- and reduce the delay to an almost imperceptible
level -- move YOUR NODE information to the top of the list, and
also move the information for commonly-called nodes up in the
list. This is especially important if you're up in the 300 or 400
block, since Fido apparently searches sequentially for your
system's name for EVERY message it lists. I don't know what
effect this might have on FidoNet -- it can't hurt the speed.
I've noticed no side effects from having the NODELIST out of
numeric order.

Perhaps the folks who developed the NODELIST.EXE program could
also get it to move things around in the nodelist file? I haven't
tried the program yet; maybe it already does it....

Just a quick note to let you all know I have found a strange
problem (if you can call it that) in the reader for
files.bbs in FIDO.  When the lines that are left justified
are read in, they are assumed to be files.  Being human, we 
all  have forgotten  to  indent  a  few times for comments
in the file.  This is not a big deal, and is easyly
corrected with a text processor.  Here's the 'bug':

When there are 3 or more lines of text in a row that you
have forgotten to space in, FIDO reads them in as one long
file.    This  causes  an  '**  OVERFLOW  **' message,  and 
bombs FIDO.  FIDO drops to batch, and tries to restart, but
locks up while booting.

For all interested, I have a Rainbow 100 (A) with 256K and a
Racal Vadic  modem. Hope this helps some of you...

                  Message Routing Failures
                             or
             What Do You Do When a Host is Down?


A good question, eh?  Fidonet is already faster and cheaper 
than the U.S. Mail, but there is still a minimum turnaround

of two days.  If you are sending to a local whose host is 
down for the night, the lag extends even longer.  It is 
somewhat disconcerting to check your mail log in the morning 
only to find that a message you entered for node XYZ didn't 
go through just because node ABC, his host, had a problem.

So what does one do to handle this case?  Well, we found a 
solution, though it might not suit everyone.

We figured that the locals would probably be receiving for a 
half an hour after national mail hour, so that they can get 
their messages from their host.  So we set up a second 
transmission schedule during that slot, where any messages 
that didn't go during the national hour get sent again 
without any routing.  We haven't been doing this for long, 
but it has already "backstopped" the routing schedule on two 
separate occasions.

This method does have a couple of drawbacks.  The biggest is 
that it can cost more money.  You might end up paying for 
five calls where you would have only paid for one.  

Also, I can already imagine the screams from some folks 
about how this would trash the whole network routing scheme.

Still, assuming that host outages are rare, this seems to me 
to be a viable method of making the whole Fidonet system 
more robust.

Your comments, of course, are always appreciated.



                   NOTICES

        As a matter of brief introduction, I am Bill
Macneill, SYSOP of FIDO node #202 in Boston, Massachusetts
(1-617-721-1688).

        Recently, one of the members of my Board (DEC-Line
-- a DEC Micro oriented board) uploaded a game file known as
JETSET.BAS...a jet plane simulator, and one of the great
classic public domain games. The problem with JETSET,
however, is that it is SOOOOOOO SLOWWWWWWW! 

        I would very much like the readers of this
newsletter to advise me as to whether JETSET has been
compiled to operate directly as an 'executable' under the
MSDOS operating environment. If one of you is familiar with
such a file, please advise me where I can obtain a copy...or
even better, why don't you just call and upload to DEC-
Line??  Again, we are at 1-617-721-1688 in Boston....
