     A couple of "FidoNet is going to hell in a handbasket" entries this
     week.

     We're half way through the FSC docs this week.

     Responses are picking up for the FidoNet by Internet list. All
     listings below the Region level will be found on the FidoNews webpage
     instead of the weekly listing here. The FidoNews webpage address is in
     the Masthead information at the end of every Issue.

     Many thanks to all the ZCs and RCs who passed my request down their
     respective chains for this information. The Coordinator structure can
     work. [grin]

     Otherwise, enjoy!

     Subject: The Fido Saga

     Well, according to the latest nodelist analysis in FidoNews, Fido will
     be gone sometime next year.  Tsk, tsk.  If it weren't for all those
     self-serving, power hungry idiots up at Fido's Mount Olympus, the
     network wouldn't be facing its demise so quickly.  Looks like some
     things will never change.  Maybe you guys should have adopted P5 when
     you had the chance.  Glad I left when I did.

     Have a Nice Day!

     BTW, I thought the discussions we had in the old Region Coordinators
     echo were pretty interesting.  Take care.

     Is a Fidonet Takeover in the works
        by Bob Moravsik 2606/583

     Unknown to the masses in Fidonet, there is a subtle
     but posibble effective plan in the works to take over
     Fidonet.  The method is simple.  Gain control of Fidonet's
     Technical Standard Committee, then start writing policy
     under the banner of technical standards.  An entire
     administrative system could be created within Fidonet based
     on the arguement that once a technical standard is
     approved by the "official committee", "officials" need
     to be created to implement.

     A history lesson:

     In the "old" times there was an attempt to position echomail
     in such a way that IT would drive Fidonet.  An echopol was
     attempted in Zone one.  It was stricken under policy 4.07
     section one which prohibits conflicting or restrictive local
     policies.  Z2 is trying the same trick.   When this failed
     a "bop" was written that tried to convince nodes that it
     was the rules to follow to get echomail.  No follow, no
     echomail.  It failed (see Mr. Sorvestre...due process is needed)

     Not to be stopped by details, we in Zone one got "bopfaq".
     Another policy dressed as a harmless question and answer
     file.  Never the less.  Its quoted as if its policy rather
     then the ravings of one person (Bruce Bodger) who was admonished
     when he started kicking around Jason Garcia (a teenager) for
     over using a software registration trial period.  (Decision
     FIDONEWS 14-10               Page 3                   10 Mar 1997


     available on request).

     NOW...we got the FTA files.  What are these.  Proposals
     to create a Fidonet Standard Technical Committee.   Who can
     create.   YOU GUESSED IT...any "rec". (plus others).  This
     standard committee can be created by people who don't
     hold any recognized Fidonet position (*ec's are not recognized).
     The current proposal is flawed.  More then one committee can
     exist <chuckle>.  And who's behind it.  Yep...the "bopfaq"
     boy who is now fighting with the RC's.  Bruce Bodger through
     his hat in the ring for the non-ZC election.  He desperately
     wants the job.  He wants to "rule" Fidonet.  Bodger got
     NO SUPPORT for the ZC position... his position.  He did this to
     slow down the process. !!!  (The ZC is elected by the RC's
     when there was a vacancy).  There was no process although he
     is trying to create one to maintain his diminishing credability.

     Bottom line.  As you read this.  The "boppy boys" are trying
     to convince the masses that they know how to run Fidonet.  Since
     they can't get their foolishness RATIFIED like Fidonet's
     policy requires, they do end runs.   First there was "echopol"..
     then "boppy".....then "bopfaq"....now "FTA xxx".  The *C's are
     getting wiser now.  Bodger's been thrown out of the *C
     conference and lurks.

     What needs to be done is for Bob Satti, the Z1 ZC, to delete
     all that foolish 1/2XX numbers from the nodelist and have the
     RC's coordinate all activity in their respective regions
     as they see fit.  Fidonet is NOT echomail.  Nodes should not
     have to jump for the echomail grapes.  Backdoor attempts
     to force a minority's will on the majority should be exposed.
     Laugh at the FTA documents.  Take them for what they are...a
     pathetic attempt to do what a few can't do via RATIFICATION.
     Fidonet is a communication media.  People have been driven
     to Internet by this constant attempt to make people "pay" for
     free communications by OBEDIENCE.   Mr. Bodger and small crew
     are busy in the background.  At least know that they are.

     Mr. Bodger...I'll be more then happy to argue your position
     in Fidonews.  DO IT IN PUBLIC.  Stop this incessive lurking
     in the shawdows.   Let's start with your title.

     Provisions have been made for storing full five-dimensional addresses
     (i.e.  zone, net, node, point, and domain) in a packed message such
     that it is possible (albeit somewhat clumsily) to extract a full five
     dimensional origin and destination for any message.  This has not,
     however, been extended to packet headers.  It would be useful for
     various reasons, such as mail pickpus and password protection of mail
     links, to be able to quickly and easily extract similar five
     dimensional addresses from a packet header.  This is a proposal for a
     packet header structure that would make that possible.

     The proposed packet header structure is as follows:

         Offset   Width     Description
         ======   =====     ===========
              0       2     Originating node number
              2       2     Destination node number
              4       2   * Originating point number
              6       2   * Destination point number
              8       8     Reserved, must be zero
             16       2     Packet sub-version (2)
             18       2     Packet version (2)
             20       2     Originating network
             22       2     Destination network
             24       1     Product code
             25       1     Product revision level

             34       2   * Originating zone
             36       2   * Destination zone
             38       8   * Originating domain
             46       8   * Destination domain
             54       4     Product specific data
             58     ---     Start of first packed message

                          * Field only guaranteed accurate in a type 2.2
                            header

     All numbers are in decimal.  The point of this proposed structure is
     that it is backwards compatible.  All significant fields of a normal
     type 2 packet header are preserved and are in the same places.  The
     following data fields of a type 2 packet have been discarded and
     replaced with new informational content:

         Packet creation date (6 bytes)
         Packet creation time (6 bytes)
         Packet baud rate (2 bytes)
         Reserved for future use (16 bytes)

     The field formerly occupied by the packet baud rate has been replaced
     by the packet sub-version number.  If this number is set to "2" (an
     impossible baud rate), then that indicates a type 2.2 packet header,
     and the fields marked above with an asterisk become valid.  If this
     field contains anything other than a 2, then only the original type
     2.0 data may be regarded as accurate.

          community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
          improvements.  Distribution of this document is unlimited.

          Fido and FidoNet are registered marks of Tom Jennings and Fido
          Software.

         Purpose

         This document should serve as a guide for the product identfier,
         PID hereafter, format for FidoNet message handlers. The purpose
         behind PIDs is related to my attempt to remove the requirement of
         Origin lines in conference mail messages.

         While I fully understand that this won't happen in all
         conferences, I would like to provide the facility to those who can
         use it (i.e. for conferences where all the participants are using
         software that supports messages without origin lines).

         Another use for PIDs is to minimize the excessive amount of
         information some programs put on the tear lines which increases
         overall transportation cost and time of conference mail.

         PID

         A PID replaces the program identifier often seen on the tear line
         of conference mail messages and is hidden behind a ^A (ASCII SOH,
         01h).  This also allows for better tracking of software causing
         problems in conferences.

     :   Only one PID per message is allowed and should only be added by
     :   the program that creates the message. I.e. programs passing the
     :   message on to someone else may not add additional PIDs. If a PID
     :   is added, no program information may be present after the tear
     :   line.

         A PID also offers the ability to add serial numbers to identify a
         specific copy of a program as being the source of a message with
         little or no effort.

         Format

           ^APID: <pID> <version>[ <serial#>]<CR>

         Sample

           ^APID: FM 2.11.b<CR>

           Would identify FrontDoor's editor, beta version 2.11 and
     replace:

            --- FM 2.11 (beta)


         Fields

         pID         The ID of the product responsible for creating the
     FIDONEWS 14-10               Page 7                   10 Mar 1997


                     message.  This should be kept as short as possible.
                     The maximum length for this field is 10 characters.

         version     The version of the product including any alpha, beta,
                     or gamma status. Only the relevant part of the version
                     should be included. I.e. 1.00 should be expressed as
                     1, 1.10 as 1.1 and 1.01 as 1.01. Alpha, beta, or gamma
                     status should be expressed by appending a / or .
                     followed by a, b, or g and optionally a revision
                     indicator, such as a1, b2, etc.  The maximum length
                     for this field is 10 characters.

         serial#     The serial number of the product, omitted if
                     irrelevant or zero. The maximum length for this field
                     is ten (10) characters.

         TID

         TIDs or "Tosser IDs" started to appear shortly after the first
         revision of this document was released. They are added by
         Conference Mail ("EchoMail") processors when a message is exported
         from the local message base and injected into the network
         distribution scope for a conference.

         When a Conference Mail processor adds a TID to a message, it may
         not add a PID. An existing TID should, however, be replaced. TIDs
         follow the same format used for PIDs, as explained above.

         List of products

         The accompanying file, PIDLIST.TXT, is a list of products known to
         support the PID proposal. Software authors are encouraged to
         inform the author of this document of changes and additions to

     Objectives
     ===========

     Several packers place a limit on the size of message that can be
     transmitted.  This is often of the order of 14K which, while
     sufficient for most purposes, is inadequate for several
     applications, and in particular for long messages gated to and
     from UUCP land.

     A SPLIT/UNSPLIT suite of two programs has been developed, intended
     to handle this problem.  SPLIT will split long .MSG format
     messages into smaller packets.  After transmission to a remote
     site, the packets may be merged by UNSPLIT to recreate the
     original message, as closely as possible.  The only differences
     are the addition of a kludge line and, possibly, a few line
     breaks.

     The system ensures that each large message, when split, generates
     a collection of small messages, each of which is still valid in
     its own right.  If recombination is not effected, the messages
     will still be usefully received, and, in particular, split
     messages to UUCP should still all get to their destinations,
     albeit in parts.

     After some weeks of testing, the system seems to be sufficiently
     stable and useful to justify making an FSC proposal.

     The ^A SPLIT kludge line
     ========================

     Messages split and joined by this system make use of an ^A kludge
     line, which has the form below.  It is proposed in this note that
     this become the basis for a "standard".

     One of these lines is added to the list of kludges preceding each
     part of a split message.  When recombined, a line of this form
     remains, for reasons which will appear later.

     Generically the lines look like this, in fixed columns:

     ^ASPLIT: date      time     @net/node    nnnnn pp/xx +++++++++++

     where
           nnnnn gives the original message number from which the
                 components have been derived (cols 41 - 45)
           pp    gives the part number (cols 47 and 48)
           xx    gives the total number of parts (cols 50 and 51)
     FIDONEWS 14-10               Page 9                   10 Mar 1997


     For example

     ^ASPLIT: 30 Mar 90 11:12:34 @494/4       123   02/03 +++++++++++
                 |      |        |  |          |     |  |  |
                 |      |        @  |          |     |  |  |
                 Date   Time        Node       MSG   |  |  Eye catcher
                 (when split)  (of origin) (at time  |  Total parts
                                           of split) Part number

     Thus a large file (existing as 123.MSG when the splitter was run)
     originating from 494/4 might be split into 3 parts with the split
     lines

     ^ASPLIT: 30 Mar 90 11:12:34 @494/4       123   01/03 ++++++++++++
     ^ASPLIT: 30 Mar 90 11:12:34 @494/4       123   02/03 ++++++++++++
     ^ASPLIT: 30 Mar 90 11:12:34 @494/4       123   03/03 ++++++++++++

     Columns 9 through 45 are really a "uniquefier".  The nnnnn
     message number is just the one the message had when it was split,
     and is of no other significance.  Similarly, the system does not
     use 4-d addressing for the node/net component, because this is of
     no real interest to this application, and requires parsing a file
     like BINKLEY.CFG, or similar extra work, to determine the other
     components.

     This is, admittedly, verbose, but if recombination fails for any
     reason (like all the packets not arriving at once) one can still
     recombine or examine the relevant pieces manually.  Note also
     that the lines are added to messages that are themselves "long",
     and the *relative* increase in length is actually very small.
     Further justification will be found below.

     Splitting large messages
     ========================

     When splitting large messages, the following happens:

     The message base is scanned for large messages.

     For each of the (few) large messages found that qualify, the
     large message is split into parts.  The original FTSC header is
     placed in each component part, save that the FileAttach bit (if
     any) is removed from the 2nd, 3rd ... parts.  No attempt is made
     to modify the To:, or From: fields.  The Subject: field for the
     2nd, 3rd ... parts is modified to include a leading part number.

     The original kludge lines are retained in the first part. Most
     other "leading" kludges, like ^AFMPT, ^ATOPT, ^AINTL are retained
     in these parts.  However, ^AEID and ^AMSGID lines, if any, are
     removed from the 2nd, 3rd ... parts.  This is potentially
     awkward, but is to avoid "dupe detectors" discarding the 2nd, 3rd
      ... parts, and in practice should cause no real problems. Large
     echomail messages originating on a system will presumably have
     their ^AEID lines added to the constituent parts at
     scanning/packing time on that system (ie AFTER splitting), and
     other large messages should probably not reach this stage - they
     FIDONEWS 14-10               Page 10                  10 Mar 1997


     should have been split or discarded earlier.

     A ^ASPLIT line is added to each part to allow for possible later
     recombination.

     If the message is addressed "TO UUCP: in the FTSC header, the To:
     lines at the start of the message text are copied to all parts.

     The "body" of the message is then split between the various
     parts.  An attempt is made to split at the end of a line in each
     case.

     The trailing tear line, ^AVia ^APath etc lines are added to all
     parts.

     Joining ("unsplitting") messages
     ================================

     When reconstituting large messages, the following happens:

     The message base is scanned for messages with ^ASPLIT lines.
     A list is made of messages to be unsplit, with each message
     having a list of its component parts. If a duplicate component
     part is found, it is discarded (thus partially getting around the
     problem of any discarded ^AEID lines in the components).
     Messages marked "in transit" or "sent" are not eligible for
     recombination.  Nor are messages with a split component number of
     00, as these will only exist as the result of an earlier
     recombination.

     For each set of components of messages to be recombined the
     following happens:

     The first component is examined so as to extract the Kludge
     lines, and any UUCP "To: " lines. These, and the FTSC header, are
     written out to a new file, with the ^ASPLIT line modified to have
     a component number of 00, so as to prevent further splitting
     should the splitter program be reapplied to the recombined
     message.  If this is not done, large messages can get into a
     tedious split-unsplit- split-unsplit... cycle each time the
     system is run.

     The text portions of the first and subsequent parts are then
     merged (discarding extra copies of kludges, UUCP "To:" lines and
     the like).

     Any tearline, Origin, ^APATH, ^AVia lines etc are appended.

     Normally the component files are then automatically deleted.

     Justification for "human readable" uniquifier.
     ==============================================

     Most systems do not display kludge lines, and the ^ASPLIT line
     should be of no real interest.  However, in one particular
     application which was using this system, the ^ASPLIT lines were
     FIDONEWS 14-10               Page 11                  10 Mar 1997


     made visible for messages that could not be recombined (because
     they become too large for gating from FidoNet to another RFC-822
     compliant network), and hence it has been deemed essential that a
     "visible" line derived from ^ASPLIT became human readable, easily
     spotted, and comprehensible.  For much the same reason, fixed
     columns have been used, rather than free format, so that archaic
     FORTRAN programmers could easily develop "unsplitters" after
     getting all the pieces!  Lastly, in this system a sort was done
     to order the ^ASPLIT line to be the last kludge line before the
     message body proper.

     Acknowledgements
     ================

     Particular thanks must be expressed to Randy Bush for offering to
     test this system in its earliest releases on the very busy 1/5
     zonegate, and for suggesting various improvements.  Thanks for
     testing are also due to Dave Wilson who operates the 5/1 zonegate
     at the other end of the link from Randy, and to Mike Lawrie of
     Rhodes Computer Centre for useful suggestions regarding the form
     of the ^ASPLIT line acceptable to non-Fido users.

     Prototype system
     ================

     A version of SPLIT/UNSPLIT using this system may be FREQ'd
     from 1:105/42 or 5:494/4 using the magic name SPLITTER.  As at
     this time I have unsubstantiated reports that it does not work
     in conjunction with systems running Novell software (I have no
     access to Novell).  It works fine using Msged and QMail.

          Status of this document
          =======================

          This  FSC  suggests  a proposed  protocol  for  the  FidoNet(r)
          community,   and   requests  discussion  and  suggestions   for
          improvements. Distribution of this document is unlimited.

          Software.

          Purpose
          =======

          The  final  goal of this document is to become  a  widely  used
          standardised  extension to FTS-0001,  like FTS-0006,  0007  and
          0008  are,  and  provide  an elegant way to  switch  to  a  new
          bundling  method  without requiring major  effort  or  breaking
          anything.

          Prologue
          ========

          The  main  thing  that needs stressing is  that  the  additions
          covered  by this document are FULLY (I repeat FULLY)  BACKWARDS
          COMPATIBLE  with  FTS-0001 (and other  existing  standards  and
          practices  in  FidoNet and WhatEverOtherNets that I  know  of).
          When I say "backwards compatible" I mean that problems it would
          create  already  exist  in the current  FTS-0001  system  (e.g.
          zone  conflicts when dealing with a non compliant  system).  In
          short   it  only  corrects  some  flaws  in  FTS-0001   WITHOUT
          generating new ones.

          In  this document I have tried to stay as much as  possible  on
          the   paths   of  existing   practices.   Therefore   I   think
          implementation  of  the additions it proposes will not  be  too
          hard.

     !    Prologue to revision 2
     !    ======================

     !    Revision   2   of  this  document  reserves  a   bit   in   the
     !    CapabilityWord  for one bundle type already in use  outside  of
     !    FidoNet,  RFC-822.  A small change was made to the  "receiving"
     !    flowchart  in order to ensure compatibility with  FSC-0039.004.
     !    In  the process a lot of errors and omissions in the  spelling,
     !    credits etc. were corrected.

          ===============

     !    All  references in the following to FSC-0039 are to Revision  1
     !    of that document.

          My thoughts on FSC-0039 and FTS-0001 rev 12
          ===========================================

          First,  revision  12  of FTS-0001 introduced  the  term  "(some
          impls)"  to indicate that some implementations used  their  own
     !    extensions  to FTS-0001 (Note that in later revisions this  was
     !    changed to "optional"). The problem is that this info cannot be
          relied upon,  because there is no way to actually validate  the
          data. One can only check whether the values of these fields are
          in the range of valid values and hope for the best.

          Second,  FSC-0039  introduced  the idea of  having  a  bitfield
     FIDONEWS 14-10               Page 13                  10 Mar 1997


          (called the Capability Word) indicating whether extension  data
          was  valid.  Through  the  Capability Word,  it  also  made  it
          possible to indicate the ability to support other,  non type 2,
          packets,  thus allowing for flexible migration towards type  3.
          It  also documented the addressing extensions used  by  various
          programs.

          However, FSC-0039 has two flaws:

          1. One  cannot  be  sure the bitfield  is  zero  because  other
             implementations might use this field for their own purposes.
             Therefore  this document includes a second  validation  copy
             for the Capability Word (CW hereafter). This copy allows the
             FSC-xxxx compliant software to validate the CW by  comparing
             the two.  The chance of some junk portraying itself as a  CW
             is significantly reduced by this.

     !       Please  note  that  the  validation  copy  is  byte  swapped
     !       compared to the normal capability word.  While this  started
     !       out  as a typo,  I decided to leave it in as  it  introduces
     !       some extra safety, without requiring much extra code effort.
     !       In later revisions of FSC-0039,  Mark adopted this idea of a
     !       validation copy too and eliminated the problem.

          2. Although  FSC-0039 provides a way to make packet headers  4D
             it  is not backwards compatible.  It cannot be used in  FTS-
             0001 sessions to unknown systems,  making FidoNet still  not
             totally 4D capable.  Although it implements fields for  zone
             and point number,  an FTS-0001 compliant application is  not
             required to look at these fields.  When a point mails  using
             these  fields  to implement its 4D address,  a  system  only
             looking  at the net/node info,  as is required by  FTS-0001,
             still sees it as a boss node, causing the obvious problems.

             This document provides a way for transparent point handling,
             using   a  technique  already  exploited  by  many   mailers
             internally.  It  will allow this document to be  implemented
             and used by mailers not supporting it.  At the same time the
             danger that a point is seen as the boss node is eliminated.

             It does NOT provide full inter-zone backwards compatibility,
             but that is not needed as badly, as problems are not yet too
             great.  Any  measures to ensure backwards  compatibility  in
             this  area  might  harm  communication  with  non-supporting
             programs, when the old system could handle the situation.

          A  Type-N Bundle will always advertise its capabilities in  the
          CW regardless of the type being sent.   As shown in the example
          below,  the CW allows Type-N processors to automatically  track
          the capability of your system.   Again, in cases where a stone-
          age processor is being used, this field will be ignored, and in
          the  unusual  event  that it is not  ignored,  and  is  somehow
          harmful  to  the  far  system,  the  Type-N  processor  can  be
          configured to send a CW of 0.

          The format of the Capability Word is designed to support up  to
          15  future bundle types,  and is bit-mapped to  facilitate  the
          easy  determination  of  the  maximum  common  level  supported
          between two nodes:

                         ** - In the example bit definitions only type 2,
                              and  the Stone-Age type,  are defined  now.
                              The rest are to be concidered "reserved  by
                              FTSC".

          The receiving Type-N bundler would AND the two words, obtaining
          a  word  expressing  the Types which are  common  to  both  the
          receiving  and the sending system.   The most significant  Type
          will be used for future sessions,  by default. Please note that
          this assumes that new bundling Types will be increasingly  more
          efficient or in some way more beneficial.  Because this may not
          always  be  the  case,  there should be a  method  provided  to
          override the automatic upgrade,  as illustrated  above,  should
          this ever happen.

          To Mark Howard,  for introducing the idea of a CW in his  FSC-
          0039  document and quite rightly pointing out one big  omision
          in revision 1 of this document.

          To  Rick Moore,  for doing a good job in processing all  these
          revisions by Mark and myself, and for his work for the FTSC in
          general.

          To  Joaquim  Homrighausen,  for his contributions  to  FidoNet
          software  in general,  and especially for his time devoted  to
          reading,  discussing  and  implementing the ideas Mark  and  I
          introduced.

          To  Andre van de Wijdeven,  for producing and letting me  beta
          test his TS-MM software, which in my opinion is the best point
          software around.  (I'm not saying available,  because it isn't
          :-()

          To john lots, for shipping this stuff to the US.

          To  Jon  Webb,  for doing a much needed grammar  and  spelling
          check.

          To Bob Hartman, Vince Periello, Tom Jennings, Eelco de Graaff,
          aXel Horst,  Arjen van Loon,  jim nutt,  Odinn Sorensen, David
          Nugent,  Peter  Janssens and many others,  for making  FidoNet
          what it is now, for me and for everybody.

          Epilog
          ======

          So  this it,  now it's up to you to decide whether or  not  to
          implement  it.  A  small  change was  made  in  the  receivers
          flowchart and a small incompatibility with the later revisions
          of  FSC-0039 was removed.  That will ensure that FSC-0048  and
          FSC-0039 mailers can happily talk to each other....

          The best way to implement this would be to always support FSC-
     FIDONEWS 14-10               Page 19                  10 Mar 1997


          0048  on inbound trafic and generate FSC-0048 on  outbound  by
          default. A switch on a per-node basis will force your software
          to be FSC-0039 or even FSC-0001 only,  and you will cover  all
          bases.

          This can be done easily, as FSC-0048 is a superset of FSC-0039
          (The -1 thing on points being the difference) which in turn is
          a superset of FTS-0001 (CW). I'd be glad to get some feedback.
          You can put it in NET_DEV or netmail me.

     All right, I admit it. I've been slacking off. I didn't get anything
     done this week. Sigh.

     The good news is that the old info section is down to under 40
     percent, so we're seeing some real progress there.

     Phased out this week: "OS/2 Systems" Section

     Phase-out highlights:
       This week: "Amiga" Section
             Deadline for info: 14 Mar 1997.
       Last week: "Atari ST/TT" Section
             Deadline for info: 7 Mar 1997.
