                               A Sense of Ease

        Computer literacy doesn't require speaking a computer 
        language, nor does it require programming skills, nor does 
        it even require extensive knowledge of already-written 
        programs. All it requires is a sense of ease around 
        computers, and the knowledge that personal computers are 
        powerful tools, and not menacing characters from science 
        fiction.  
           --Peter McWilliams

        The advanced [ETS] placement course in computer science 
        includes such topics as recursion, operations on stacks, 
        lists, and trees, and the heap sort. These are complicated, 
        machine-independent abstractions that are not learned while 
        sitting at a terminal. They are learned by hearing competent 
        lectures, studying a textbook, and by sitting alone gleaning 
        insights from drawing diagrams and walking through

        prospective codes....  Replying to the question, What is the 
        best single indicator of an applicant's programming ability, 
        one of today's most respected computer scientists, Edsger W. 
        Dijkstra, wrote: '...an absolute mastery of his native 
        tongue.' 
           --Merrit & Stix


           Here's what we wish: We wish that we were running a very 
        expensive private school for little children, and that 
        McWilliams wanted us to take his sxi-year old daughter and 
        provide her with a good dose of literacy, the antiquated 
        kind, 'book literacy,' they probably call it nowadays.  

           First we'd take his certified check for our standard, 
        large, unrefundable deposit, and then we'd tell him about 
        our real neat, absolutely painless, and invariably effective 
        Book Literacy Education Program.  

           The yoke of book literacy is easy, we would tell him, and 
        its burden is light. Quite contrary to the foolish notions 
        of self-appointed reformers, book literacy does NOT require 
        reading and writing in book language. Nor does it require 
        any noticible knowledge of already-written books. All it 
        requires, as you would surely be the first to understand, 
        McWilliams, is a sense of ease around books!  

           Little children, you see, are afraid of books. Yes, 
        afraid.  They see them as menacing characters from the walls 
        of doctors' waiting rooms and quiet, dreary libraries, where 
        fun is not allowed. Our program teaches children that books 
        are powerful tools, good for building walls and castles, and 
        for keeping drawings from blowing away, and even for 
        standing on to reach the good stuff that grown-ups like to 
        keep to themselves. Why we actually let our young scholars 
        PLAY with books, open them, close them, even turn some of 
        the pages, and all by themselves.  That's the REAL 
        education, you know, learning by doing. You just leave your 
        precious little tyke with us, and in no time at all--say 
        ten, twelve years max--she will be the most book-literate 
        kid on the block, chock full of a sense of ease. And all of 
        that for a measly fifteen thou a year!  

           And may the future bring you a million RETURNs without 
        GOSUB, buster.  

           We are, you see, ready to consider 'computer literacy.' 
        We suspected, mostly because the educationalistic faddists 
        were so enthusiastic about it, that it was all bunk. Now, 
        having done some homework, we can reach a better informed 
        opinion: It IS all bunk.  

           To begin with, it is not 'literacy' in any reasonable 
        sense of the word. 'Literacy' has become nothing but a 
        pretentious title for an 'awareness' conjoined with any 
        modicum of acquaintance. If you know that slide-rules exist, 
        you have achieved slide-rule awareness, which is already 







FIDONEWS     --           26 Aug 85  00:18:06           Page 3

        quite enough to earn you a splendid grade in a mathematics 
        education course. If you can actually use a slide-rule, or 
        even if you have just slid one a bit, you have slide-rule 
        literacy.  

           (That's just for now of course. The school people have 
        obviously not yet received the pedagogical doctrine of Peter 
        McWilliams, who is a 'syndicated computer columnist,' just 
        the kind of expert they take from. When they hear the word, 
        they will discover that slide-rule literacy calls for 
        nothing more formidable than a sense of ease around slide-
        rules.) 

           And then there's all that bunk about computer 
        'languages,' which are languages in just the same way that 
        the 'language of the flowers' is language--not at all. They 
        are codes, ingenious and elaborate codes, which is what they 
        must be if they are to work. Computer languages provide the 
        possibility of an exact and precisely limited correspondence 
        not only between what is said and what is meant, but also 
        between what is meant and what is so in the strictly defined 
        system about which, and ONLY about which, statements can be 
        made.  

           For computing, that's good, and it works. But those same 
        attributes are characteristic of the very least of the 
        powers of language, communication, a power also wielded by 
        wolves and crows. If wolves and crows do not devise 
        computers and computer 'languages,' it is because they have 
        none of the higher powers of language, especially meatphor 
        and discourse. It is in those powers that we grow when we 
        study language, and to pretend that the study of computer 
        language is the study of language is primarily a convenience 
        for those who pretend that they teach the powers of 
        language.  

           And then there's another thing--that bunk about 'fear of 
        computers.' It is, of course, possible that there are 
        certain people who do fear computers, even as there are 
        probably people who fear shredded wheat or party hats. They 
        are loonies.  Computers are no more likely than rulers, or 
        even sextants, to provoke fear in people who are not 
        loonies. What we see at work here is a longstanding 
        educationalistic con job that has been eagerly adopted by 
        peddlers as well as politicians, who also make their livings 
        by preying on emotions.  

           It is the pose of the big-hearted giver, who so 
        charitably understands your shortcomings, and so selflessly 
        seeks only your good. He kindly tells you that there IS a 
        little something wrong with you, maybe just a little 
        learning disability, or an unraised consciousness, or this 
        irrational fear of computers, that you can't seem to 
        overcome all by yourself. But don't worry. Your deficiency 
        is 'perfectly natural' in one who has not yet had the 
        inestimable benefit of his ministrations, which he will be 
        only too happy to provide.

           And there is yet one more thing--the pernicious notion 
        that learning to work a computer has something to do with 
        education.  One of its versions suggests that no one can be 
        educated without learning about computers, which confuses 
        training with education and information with knowledge, as 
        is the custom in the schools.  An alternative version 
        pronounces, as is also the custom in the schools, that NOW 
        we know what to do. NOW we can teach those students who have 
        stubbornly refused to be taught by 'traditional' methods, 
        i.e., the LAST few paroxysms of innovative thrusts.  

           The other quotation is from a letter to the NYT by Susan 
        M.  Merritt and Allen H. Stix, members of the computer 
        science department at Pace University. When they say 
        'science,' they seem to mean SCIENCE, which is neither a 
        pleasant feeling nor a vocational skill, but a discipline in 
        the mind. It is to be learned just as they say, which is 
        just as ANY mental discipline is to be learned, by hearing 
        competent lectures, studying books, and sitting alone.  

           Those things are not allowed in the schools. Competent 
        lectures are elitist and authoritarian, books are just NOT 
        experiential, and sitting alone is aberrant behavior. The 
        schools will have to teach computer science in THEIR way.  
        Spending somebody else's money brings a great sense of ease.

              Some Utilities I'm Looking for and Haven't Found


        There are a few public domain utilities I would like to
        locate for my Fido host, which I have unfortunately not yet
        found in my random wanderings around other Fido systems.
        I'm running a Tandy 1200HD, which is an IBM XT-clone.
        If you have any of the things I'm looking for, either send
        them to me by Fidomail, or send me a message detailing how
        I can get them.  Emphasis on public domain.  Sources
        desirable but not absolutely necessary (beggars can't be
        choosers!) 

        1 - A disk utility like DU for CP/M.  When setting up my
        system, I was faced with the need to patch ATDT to ATDP in
        Fido, and ended up Kermiting the file over to my CP/M box
        to make the patch.  Not too hard, but someone out there
        must have a good disk patch utility.  The search command in
        particular has been usefull in DU.

        2 - A full-screen filer similar to the VFILER program
        distributed with ZCPR3 for CP/M compatible systems.  What
        would be nice is a full-screen view of the files in a
        directory node, with commands to do individual and group
        file manipulations, as well as printing, bouncing up and
        down the directory tree, etc.  

        3 - A good incremental backup utility.  Something that
        would allow me to do an occasional full backup, and then on
        a daily or weekly basis cut a floppy with all of the files
        that have changed or appeared since the last full or
        incremental backup.

        4 - A directory entry raw editor.  Something like FDBED
        under Tops-20.  You give it a filespec, and it puts up all
        of the information contained in the directory entry on the
        screen and lets you move around and edit the entries with
        absolutely no error checking.  Usefull when directories get
        trashed, or when you do a file transfer that bombs before
        the file gets closed, and you want to hack on the directory
        entry.  I'm not yet experienced enough on MS-DOS to know
        how practical this particular utility would be.

        I suppose that's enough for this time.  If I get enough
        responses, I will summarize what I find out, and how the
        things I get actually stack up to what I want, in a future
        article for the news...

        No  matter their stock doesn't appreciate in value  at  any 
        fast pace their is one masterful use for kaypros.  Put TBBS 
        Bulletin  board on a 2700 10m machine and show me something 
        more  powerful  for major companies to run their  in  house 
        BBS's for terminal users from around the country . salesmen 
        etc , sure it can't except 12 incomming lines but $ 2800.00 
        beats the pants off of having your big mainframe  40-50-60-
        100000.00 computer played around with by hackers. Cp/m will 
        live and will resurface because most people haven't the 1st 
        idea  of  what computer to buy but run out and buy  IBM  or 
        clones  and  spend fortunes to run  What.  Simple  programs 
        excluding  Lotus etc but then again they usually aren't the 
        buyers  of Lotus.  As soonn as some advertising  exec  gets 
        smart and sells the idea of all the wonderful prgms for cpm 
        that exist plus the p/domain prgms you will see c/pm again. 
        Really  how many of the users of 16 bit computers know  the 
        difference between 8 and 16 bit and for sure the home buyer 
        isn't  going to be the programmers of the future except for 
        a  few.   Kaypro is now the largest selling C/pm system  in 
        the  usa  and it won't be long before some  one  figures  a 
        marketing stradgy out to renew interest. How many IBM clone 
        programs came from c/pm.

        Re: Jim's comments

        Too true, unfortunately most purchase decisions are made on 
        the  basis of information derived from some marketing  jock 
        who may never have even put a disk into a computer.  All he 
        is doing is pushing a product.   Think about it!   How many 
        computer  salesmen are competent users?  How many  computer 
        salesmen even own a personal computer (purchased with their 
        own  cash,  not provided by the employer)?   Come to  think 
        about it,  how many people here at A&M have invested  their 
        own  cash  in a microcomputer?  I have decided to  postpone 
        buying  a new computer until a decidedly  superior  product 
        appears.  Until that time, and it ain't here yet, I'll keep 
        running my Kaypro.   After all,  why should I pay a premium 
        to SLOW DOWN?


        Well you've heard there side now lets hear yours!

        FIDO 19/918
                     An Idea for FidoNews
             I am a Fido user in Lubbock, Texas. I have a
        suggestion for the newsletter that I am sure many people
        who are in the same fix will agree with. Here is my
        problem: I own a low speed (300 baud) modem. I don't have a
        dedicated line, either, so I use our one phone in the
        house. We also have this diabolical thing called "call
        waiting" that is one of AT&T's attempts at destroying
        useful telecommunications. Last, I would love to be able to
        read all the issues of Fidonews when they come in, but for
        one problem: They are so long!

         
             It seems as though everytime I start downloading one,
        an incoming phone call fouls up my carrier, and I have to
        re-download the whole thing, read and unread articles, all
        over again. What would be nice is a feature that would let
        the user jump around in the newsletter, reading only the
        articles they want to. I know this would entail lots of
        modifications to Fido, but surely it wouldn't be that
        difficult? The newsletter could be packaged with a "Table
        of contents" at the beginning describing article titles,
        authors, content, and a logical record offset in the file.
        (Page number!) Then they could be called up via a special
        command, and the user could read only the articles he/she
        wanted to, or read some and read the rest later, and so on.
        For die-hards that wish to download the thing w/ Xmodem and
        print it out later (It saves eye strain) they could still
        go into the File area and download...the table of contents
        file format structure shouldn't be any problem, it may even
        help them, too!

         
             I don't have a Rainbow or PC or anything nearly
        compatible, so I don't know what sort of modifications this
        would require, perhaps the file format would not make it
        possible to jump around like that. But, I believe that
        FidoNews is the best thing to come around since local
        bulletin boards.

        --------------Also possibly of some interest---------------
             I have written a freeware bulletin board that has a
        network system similiar to Fido but incompatible, called
        TI-SUB.  You can call the headquarters board, sysop Matt
        Storm, at 806-792-5831 if you want to look around. Number
        two is in Philadelphia PA at 215-676-7393, sysop Mike Bell,
        and a major magazine is looking into it right now. For more
        info, write to Erik Olson, 3712 68th, Lubbock Texas, 79413,
        or FidoMail to 19/67 or 19/918.

        ********************************************************
        Part of an article in PC WEEK:

        GTE's PC Pursuit Offers Users  Electronic  Links  Via  Local 
        Call: 

        GTE Telenet last week introduced PC Pursuit,  a service that 
        will  allow  PC  users  to  connect  to  database  services, 
        bulletin boards,  or individual computers by making a single 
        local phone call.  

        According to GTE Telenet Vice President  Floyd  Trogdon,  PC 
        Pursuit  "links the user's terminal to any off-network phone 
        number...  that he wishes  to  call,  whether  it's  a  free 
        database  in  Boston,  a  specialized  bulletin board in Los 
        Angeles, or his brother in Denver." 

        The new service,  though officially  launched  to  allow  PC 
        users  to  contact other PCs in distant locations,  also was 
        designed  to  take   advantage   of   Telenet's   nationwide 
        distribution network.  

        The  PC Pursuit service will make use of the excess capacity 
        of GTE Telenet,  and as a result is only available at  night 
        and on weekends.  During the day, Telenet's network capacity 
        is dedicated to large corporate uers.  

        To  use  PC  Pursuit,  a  caller dials the PC Pursuit access 
        number in his area.  The GTE computer asks for the  caller's 
        number,  and  the  city  and  number  to be called.  At this 
        point, the caller hangs up.  

        Shortly thereafter,  the PC Pursuit service calls  the  user 
        back,  and  makes  the  long  distance connection requested.  
        While the connection is being made,  PC  Pursuit  keeps  the 
        user  informed  of the progress of the call through periodic 
        status messages.  A call can last up to an hour.  

        GTE charges subscribers $25 for using the service regardless 
        of the amount of time that the  service  is  actually  used.  
        Users can pay by credit card.  

        Currently,  only  12  cities  have  access  to  PC  Pursuit: 
        Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Detroit,  Houston, 
        Los  Angeles,  New York,  Philadelphia,  San Francisco,  and 
        Washington.  

        The system supports 300 and 1200 baud modem operation.  2400 
        baud service will be available in October.  

        On-line sign-up for the service is available by calling 800-
        835-3001 or 703-689-2987 (in Virginia.)

        Analysis:

        GTE  is  offering  an  off-hours,  flat rate ($25 per month) 
        gateway to any dial-up system.  For  the  cost  of  a  local 
        phone  call,  any  dial-up  system  is now reachable from 12 
        cities.  

        Shades  of  FidoNet!   Just  think  what  will  happen  when 
        outbound  hosts  are  formed in these 12 cities!  Nationwide 
        FidoMail/FidoNet forwarding of unlimited message traffic for 
        a flat fee of $25 per month!  

        I don't know if the 800 number  listed  above  is  voice  or 
        data,  but I'm waiting to get through (busy tone) to get all 
        the details.  

        Those of you not in the selected  12  cities,  get  on  your 
        local  BBS  systems  and start lobbying everyone to call GTE 
        and request that your city be added as soon as possible.  

        Unless I am wrong, this is the first time a major company is 
        creating a product/service that shows they fully  understand 
        the  potential  of  the  hobbiest/hacker  telecommunciations 
        community.  

        Let's prove their right.

            Review of Alpha Software's "Keyworks" keyboard macro
                               software.

              By Mark Perloe, for the National PCjr Users Group



                  Alpha's  KEYWORKS lets  you redefine  combinations
        of    keystrokes  to  customize  any  operation.    You  can
        personalize your  software with  up to   380 macros and save
        7000   keystrokes. KEYWORKS  also lets you easily  customize
        menus that   can  be  called up  for a variety of functions.
        Although these  features alone  justify the  purchase price,
        the few extras are also appreciated.  The ability to encrypt
        files, copy  files, format  disks, and search directories is
        very useful.   KEYWORKS comes with suggested macros and pop-
        up menus  for many  programs.   If you  are presently  using
        PROKEY, but  wish to  switch, Alpha  has included  a  simple
        conversion program.

                   WORDSTAR is a breeze with KEYWORKS.  It loads its
        macros from  the autoexec  file  but  macros  files  can  be
        interchanged without  even exiting  from the  file  you  are
        writing or  you might  choose one  set to  use when  writing
        reports  for   school  and   another  for  writing  letters.
        Paragraphs for  form letters can be stored as separate files
        on the  floppy disk  and  called  up  with  two  keystrokes.
        Menus are  provided for  WORDSTAR but  in less than one hour
        you can  customize or  create  additional  mouse  compatible
        pop-up menus for any command you wish.

                KEYWORKS can come to the rescue when problems occur.
        More than  once I've  had Wordstar  files too  big to fit on
        partially filled disk.  Rather than lose the files, KEYWORKS
        allowed me  to format  a new  disk.  When logging to another
        drive in  Wordstar you are required to have overlay files on
        the logged  drive or  the program  may freeze.   This can be
        easily solved by using KEYWORKS copy command to transfer the
        necessary files.   File  encryption and test window creation
        can be valuable aids for any user.

                   A single macro can call other macros or pause for
        fixed or  variable lengths  which  is  great  for  designing
        forms.   This has  made data  entry a  much faster task with
        DBASE.   Frequent entries  can have  their own  macros which
        pause for  certain fields.   For instance, recurring monthly
        checks can  be recorded easily with minimal keystrokes.  You
        can design the macro to pause only for entry of the date and
        amount.   The remainder  of the data fields will be supplied
        by the macro.

                  KEYWORKS `USER GUIDE' is short and sweet.  The way
        to learn  KEYWORKS is  to use  it.   The menus  are so  well
        designed that  you can  easily learn  to edit, list, create,
        change macros or menus without ever opening the manual.

                   Compatibility has always been a problem for those
        of us  using expanded  PCjr's.   If I had a dollar for every
        supposedly "compatible"  program that  crashed my IBM PCjr's
        RAM disk  or erased  the video   memory,  I would be able to
        afford a  real PC!   Alpha Software has come to our aid with
        KEYWORKS.   This program  is an invaluable tool just waiting
        to make  life with  Jr a  little bit  easier.   It  coexists
        happily with  ramdisks, print spoolers, and Racore expansion
        boxes.   This is  not true  for  PROKEY  and  SUPERKEY,  its
        competitors.

                     If versatility, user friendliness and price are
        important in  your software  decisions, then  KEYWORKS is  a
        powerful program  that you  will want  in your  autoexec.bat
        file.
