     I/O, I/O, Its Off to Work We Go!

     There is much noise made about running 286 based machines  at  8,
     10   or   even  12  Megahertz.   While  running  your  computer's
     microprocessor at a faster speed will make a difference, for many
     tasks the difference is bounded because the  limiting  factor  is
     often   the   speed  of  your  input  and  output  devices  known
     collectively as I/O.  That these devices slow  down  the  CPU  is
     seen by the typical times involved. 8 MHz means that the CPU goes
     through  8 million cycles per second.  Since a single instruction
     on the 80xx family of chips takes from two to over twenty cycles,
     a CPU in the current generation of  MS-DOS  machine  can  run  at
     roughly 1 MIPS (millions of instructions per second).

     Memory  chips  are  rated  at  speeds  of  70-200 nanoseconds.  A
     nanosecond is a billionth of a second which means that such chips
     are capable of speed comparable to CPU speeds.  That  the  speeds
     are  slightly less is shown by the need for "wait states",  which
     slow down the CPU to allow access to memory  at  its  speed;  RAM
     speeds,  however,  are  roughly  equal  to those of the CPU.  I/O
     speeds are considerably less.  Even a fast hard disk rated at  20
     milliseconds   has   a  rated  speed  100,000  times  the  speeds
     associated to  RAM.  Of  course,  because  the  RAM  speed  is  a
     statement  about  each  access and hard disk access times involve
     the first access of a disk sector, the actual ratios are not that
     bad.

     But memory access, even by slow memory chips, is much faster than
     even speedy hard disks;  diskettes are even  slower.  While  disk
     transfer  rates  are  slower than RAM exchanges,  they are speedy
     compared to  output  through  parallel  or  serial  ports,  where
     transfer  rates are measured in 100's of bytes per second.  (1200
     baud, for example,  means roughly 120 characters per second.) And
     your  console,  the  name  for  the combined keyboard/monitor I/O
     device must interface the computer's slowest  component  --  you;
     its speeds are often the slowest of all.

     There  are  software  tools  to try to speed up I/O especially by
     using RAM for certain operations.  This month,  I'll discuss  one
     category  of  those  tools  --  disk  caches;  programs  that can
     substantially speed up disk access.


     In this article, I discuss six commercial and one
     shareware disk cache programs; the programs are:

     o  Emmcache, a shareware product by Frank Lozier;

     FidoNews 4-27                Page 5                   20 Jul 1987


     o  Lightning from the Personal Computer Support Group;

     o  Polyboost from Polytron;

     o  Quickcache from Microsystems Developers, Inc.;

     o  Speedcache from FSS Ltd;

     o  Super PC-Kwik from Multisoft Corp.; and

     o  Vcache from Golden Bow Systems.


     What Is a Disk Cache?

     Disk caches are based on the idea that you are likely to want  to
     access  a file that you accessed recently.  This is not only true
     for obvious data files like a database  which  you  might  search
     several times in a row, but also for program overlays and for the
     files that DOS often consults to locate other files:  the FAT and
     the various directories, especially the root directory.

     Thus every time that a file is accessed, a cache will keep a copy
     of that file in memory set aside  especially  for  that  purpose.
     Since  this  special memory is limited,  the cache has to have an
     algorithm to decide which parts of the cache to clear out to make
     room for new sectors.  All the caches under  discussion  use  the
     algorithm of discarding those parts of the cache which were least
     recently accessed; that is, not the ones that were first read the
     longest  ago  but rather than ones which were needed longest ago.
     Whenever DOS calls for a sector  from  disk,  the  cache  program
     intercepts  the call to check if the requested material is in the
     cache memory.  If it is,  the copy in memory is used and  a  disk
     access  is  saved.  A  cache can avoid anywhere from one-third to
     two-thirds of your disk accesses.  To allow a large cache,  it is
     natural to put the data part of the cache (that is, the copies of
     the  sectors  which were read rather than code that controls this
     data) in extended or expanded memory.

     For safety's sake,  you would not want these  programs  to  delay
     writing to disk material that DOS wants to write to disk; this is
     called  keeping  dirty  buffers  and  none of these programs keep
     dirty buffers.  However,  as I'll explain,  DOS does some of  its
     own disk caching and it does keep dirty buffers which can produce
     problems.


     Do not confuse keeping dirty buffers, that is delaying writing to
     disk,  with  caching  writes.  The  latter  means  that the cache
     writes to disk but keeps a copy of the material which is  written
     to  disk  if  it  is  different  from  the  copy  that  was  read
     previously.  For example,  if  you  load  a  file  in  your  word
     processor,  change  it and save it,  a program that caches writes
     will save a copy of the final file version in its cache while one
     that does not,  will not keep such a  copy.  All  the  commercial
     programs  discussed  in  this article cache writes,  but Emmcache
     FidoNews 4-27                Page 6                   20 Jul 1987


     does not.

     When I first started using a cache, I found the experience eerie.
     I'd do some action that I often did  and  wondered  why  my  disk
     access light wasn't going on.


     Types of Memory

     In our discussion of caching,  various references will be made to
     the different kinds of memory that are available to microcomputer
     users.  These include:

     o Conventional  memory,  the  640K  of Random Access Memory (RAM)
       that is readily accessible by most 8088/8086/80186 computers.

     o Extended  memory,  the  memory  above  1  megabyte  (up  to  16
       megabytes)  that is accessible by 80286 computers.  This memory
       is not normally accessible for use as conventional  memory  but
       is generally used for RAM disks, disk caches or print spoolers.

     o Lotus/Intel/Microsoft  Expanded  Memory Specification (LIM EMS)
       and supporting memory boards (up to 8 megabytes) are  paged  in
       and out of conventional memory, thereby providing the user with
       additional memory for supported software.


     Not a Memory Cache

     You  should  be  careful  to distinguish between a disk cache and
     memory caches.  There are circumstances where it may happen  that
     some  of  your  RAM runs at a higher speed than most of your RAM.
     In that case,  it may  pay  to  cache  some  of  the  reading  of
     instructions  from  the slow RAM to speed up programs with loops.
     Two situations are where you add a  speedup  (usually  80186-  or
     80286-based)  board to a PC with lots of old RAM typically at 200
     nanoseconds or with 386 machines where RAM that keeps up with the
     processor should be rated at 100 or even 70 nanoseconds.  In  any
     event,  these situations involve a memory cache, not a disk cache
     which is the subject of this article.



     Caches Versus RAM Disks

     You can also cut down on access to a physical disk by using a RAM
     disk,  that is by setting aside a part of RAM as a  virtual  disk
     which  DOS  accesses  as  if it were an ordinary disk.  There are
     several differences between RAM disks and disk caches.  Accessing
     files from a RAM disk is often slightly faster as our time  tests
     will  show.  Moreover,  the  first  access of a file with a cache
     will be slower than later accesses.  On the  negative  side,  you
     must  decide  in advance which files you'll want on the RAM disk;
     you'll also have to be sure to copy any changed data  files  from
     the  RAM  disk  to a real disk or risk losing them when you power
     down or if your system crashes.
     FidoNews 4-27                Page 7                   20 Jul 1987


     Which should you use?  That depends on how you use your computer.
     If you only use a few programs without extensive  data  files,  a
     RAM  disk  is probably better if you can make one large enough to
     hold what it needs to.  In other circumstances,  a cache  may  be
     preferable.  If  you  have  the RAM,  there may be sense in using
     both:  a RAM disk for your common programs and a cache to take up
     the  slack.  Most  of the cache programs have built-in procedures
     to avoid caching programs from the RAM disk, allowing you to save
     valuable cache space for files from your physical disks.


     Read Ahead

     Many caches will "read ahead",  that is,  read in an entire track
     whenever  any  reading  takes place.  If your files are large and
     not fragmented,  this can give you a real speed advantage but  if
     not,  your  cache  will  fill up with unused material.  On a hard
     disk with many isolated bad sectors, read ahead can actually slow
     down disk access  because  of  phantom  disk  errors.  Lightning,
     Super  PC-Kwik,  and  Vcache  have read ahead while the others do
     not.  Super PC-Kwik has the advantage of having read ahead as  an
     option  that  you can turn off.  The makers of Polyboost maintain
     that since most hard disks  have  errors  and  fragmented  files,
     their  lack  of read ahead is a gain over the competition,  but I
     think it will depend very much on your individual  setup.  In  my
     own case,  for example, I have turned read ahead off when running
     on my main machine because of the isolated bad sectors on my hard
     disk.


     Are Caches Dangerous?

     If your word processor fouls up a file write,  all you are likely
     to lose is the file you wanted to save.  Typically,  the files in
     your cache include the FATs and root directories of  your  disks.
     If these go bad,  you are likely to have real problems getting to
     any of the data on your entire disk.

     There are various tools which can help you recover  from  such  a
     disaster,  but  they may not always work.  This means that caches
     have an inherent danger to them.  Of course,  since DOS  is  also
     writing  these  files  all the time,  you could make the argument
     that caches are no more dangerous than DOS; perhaps even less so,
     since DOS keeps dirty buffers.

     I cannot answer the  questions  about  whether  disk  caches  are
     really  dangerous.  I  can report that I've met several users who
     are sure that problems they've had with FATs were caused by cache
     programs.  This may well be true,  although it is also true  that
     if  you have any problems with the logical structure of your disk
     and you have a cache,  you are likely to blame the cache.  During
     the testing of cache programs which went over six months,  I lost
     the contents of one of my hard disks three times.  Two seemed  to
     be  hardware  problems solved in one case by a low level reformat
     and in the other  by  a  disk  replacement.  But  the  third  one
     involved   a  piece  of  software  crashing  the  system;   after
     FidoNews 4-27                Page 8                   20 Jul 1987


     rebooting, the root directory on the hard disk was chopped liver.
     I'm suspicious that the culprit was the cache  I  was  using  but
     maybe  it  was  DOS' dirty buffers or the program that crashed in
     the first place.  All I can say is that  caching  may  be  risky.
     You should be sure to back up often but especially so if you have
     a cache.  In fact, unless you are willing to back up regularly, I
     recommend  strongly  against a cache.  On the other hand,  caches
     are rather useful.  I'm still using  a  cache  in  spite  of  the
     problems  that  I had and some of those who are certain that they
     had cache related problems are still using  them.  And  I've  met
     people  who  feel  that  caches  are  among  their most important
     utilities.


     Non-standard Setups

     Because of the inherent dangers in caching  and  because  caching
     involves modifications of the disk BIOS, you need to be extremely
     careful  if  your  disk  setup  is non standard.  You may need to
     consult the vendors.  Super PC-Kwik explicitly says not to use it
     if you have a Bernoulli Box while Vcache says  that  it  supports
     these  devices.  The  publishers  of  Vcache warned me not to use
     Vcache with my 60 Meg Priam disk which I partitioned with Priam's
     software into two 30 Meg drives.

     Only large disks handled with the VFEATURE program  they  publish
     are  compatible  with  Vcache.  On the other hand,  Super PC-Kwik
     warns against disks with non-standard sector sizes but said  that
     it  should  work  with  software  making  multiple  standard  DOS
     partitions.  I was warned that they had not  tested  the  program
     with  the  Priam  software  but  I  can  report  that  it  worked
     perfectly.  Here,  my advice is to check with the publishers,  be
     sure  that  you  are backed up and run CHKDSK several times a day
     when you first try a caching program with anything non-standard.

     With these programs, you cannot cache a network by having a cache
     on your work station although you can sometimes cache the network
     disks with a cache on the server.  These are complex  issues  and
     before  attempting  to  use caches on machines connected to LANs,
     you should be sure to speak with both the cache  vendor  and  the
     network vendor.

     There is a second warning that needs to be made about using these
     programs  with  AT  extended  memory,  an  option  that  is  only
     available   with   Polyboost,    Super   PC-Kwik   and    Vcache.
     Unfortunately,  there  is  no  memory  management protocol for AT
     extended memory provided by the current  versions  of  DOS.  This
     lack of a standard means there is potential for programs that you
     try  to  load  there  to not know of each others existence and to
     therefore overwrite each other.  Since IBM publishes  the  source
     code  for  VDISK,  all these programs know about its protocol and
     can avoid clobbering it.  The situation is not so good for  other
     virtual  disk programs.  I've seen complaints about problems with
     AST's SUPERSPL program and I've had  problems  with  a  cache  in
     extended  memory  overwriting  a  RAM  disk  set  with the RAMDRV
     program included with Microsoft Windows and with some versions of
     FidoNews 4-27                Page 9                   20 Jul 1987


     MS-DOS.  It is unfortunate that Microsoft has not  published  the
     specifications  that this program uses to access extended memory.
     So,  if you are using any other programs in extended  memory  and
     using  an  extended  memory  cache,  be  sure  to  check  out the
     operation of the other programs after the cache is loaded.  Super
     PC-Kwik and Vcache have a command line parameter  which  you  can
     use to give the program an absolute address in extended memory at
     which  to  load  and  so avoid the conflict "by hand".  That they
     have to resort to such a kludge speaks to the rather sorry  state
     of extended memory support in DOS 3.x.

     A  second  aspect  of caches in extended memory is that access of
     extended memory involves features in the ROM BIOS  that  are  not
     often  used in the current generation of AT software.  Thus,  the
     operation may be improper on some  AT  clones.  In  fact,  Vcache
     comes  with a program to test the BIOS access of extended memory.
     If there is a problem, the clone maker must correct it.

     Given the advent of a DOS that will access extended memory, it is
     essential to get such problems rectified.

     Two of the programs Speedcache  and  Quickcache  load  as  device
     drivers rather than as com files.  Conventional wisdom would hold
     that  device  drivers  are  somewhat  less prone to compatibility
     problems but I don't know if that is valid in these cases.


     Use Your Free Cache

     If you don't purchase and use one of these  stand  alone  caching
     programs,  you  should  at  least be sure to make use of the free
     cache that comes with DOS.  The cache size is set in units of 512
     bytes called buffers.  The default number,  which DOS uses if you
     don't  specify otherwise,  is two for 8088 machines and three for
     80826 based machines;  both are woefully inadequate.  To increase
     the number of buffers you must include a line

       buffers=nn

     in  your  config.sys file.  Here nn is the number of buffers that
     you want and the recommended numbers tend to be from 15 to 20.

     Why not take buffers=99?  The algorithms that DOS uses are not as
     efficient as those in commercial caches so that the time it takes
     to search the buffers to see if  the  proper  sector  is  in  the
     buffer  negates the time saved once the number of buffers becomes
     too high.

     What are the disadvantages of using buffers for  a  cache?  First
     there  is  the  issue  of dirty buffers.  Actually,  just using a
     commercial cache doesn't effect this since caches still  use  DOS
     for  reading  and  writing  and so the DOS buffers will still get
     used.  However,  a cache that lets you  decrease  the  number  of
     buffers  that you use will force DOS to write its buffers to disk
     more often because of space considerations.  Another disadvantage
     of DOS buffers is that since it is based on 512 byte chunks, if a
     FidoNews 4-27                Page 10                  20 Jul 1987


     program requests more than that at once,  DOS will always  go  to
     disk  and  not  check  to  see  if the request is residing in its
     buffers.  Finally, there is the size issue that I mentioned;  for
     really large caches, you'll need a commercial program.

     In short,  if you don't use a commercial caching program, be sure
     to put a line like

       buffers=20

     into your config.sys file.


     Parameters

     Once loaded,  cache programs act in the background and require no
     action  or  input from the user.  But some of these programs have
     option switches which you'll need to study carefully to load  the
     program to operate in an optimal manner.  For many,  the defaults
     will be correct,  but you'all at least want to adjust  the  cache
     size.

     What  is  the  proper size?  That's a trade off-between what else
     you want to use your RAM for and how  you  use  your  machine.  I
     have  the impression that unless your cache is at least 60K,  you
     may be better served by DOS buffers although for some operations,
     a 20K cache will show a noticeable improvement.

     Lightning has the annoying feature of using  EMS  memory  if  you
     have it, even if you'd prefer to use conventional memory; it does
     not  support  AT extended memory.  As the name implies,  Emmcache
     uses only  EMS  memory.  Speedcache  supports  the  special  bank
     switching  protocol  on  the  Tall  Tree  JRAM  boards as well as
     conventional and EMS memory.  For the other programs, you'll have
     to decide whether your cache will reside in conventional,  EMS or
     AT  extended  memory and how much memory it will take.  Be warned
     that some of the programs default to rather  unreasonable  values
     of  cache  size,  such as all the remaining EMS memory or all the
     conventional memory except for 232K for your remaining  programs.
     Other  parameters vary from program to program and concern things
     like what drives to cache and what algorithms to use in  specific
     cases.  For all but the what and how much memory to use,  you can
     probably get away with using the defaults initially.

     Super PC-Kwik has many switches and it may pay to  vary  some  of
     the  switches  and do some testing if some aspects of performance
     seem below what you expect.  For example,  on  the  Kaypro  286i,
     changing  the  diskette  parameter  from  the  default /d+ to /d-
     resulted in an improvement of the diskettes test by a  factor  of
     more than 4!


     Memory Usage

     Table  1 shows memory usage of the cache;  it lists the amount of
     conventional memory used by the  control  part  of  the  software
     FidoNews 4-27                Page 11                  20 Jul 1987


     exclusive of the memory taken by the cache.  If you put the cache
     in  conventional  memory,  the  amount  in  this  table  will  be
     overwhelmed by the amount of memory taken  by  the  cache  itself
     but,  if  you  place  the  cache in EMS or extended memory,  this
     figure will be quite important.  For  some  of  the  conventional
     memory  caches,  you  pick  only  the  total  size  of cache plus
     controlling code.

     For these,  the amount of memory in the control  part  cannot  be
     determined;  these  are  indicated  in  the Table with an *.  All
     numbers are in kilobytes except for  the  first  row.  For  those
     that allow you to decrease the number of DOS buffers,  the second
     row can show  a  rather  significant  savings.  The  figures  for
     diskette  cache  give  the  amount  needed  to cache two diskette
     drives;   for  several  of  the  programs,  diskette  caching  is
     automatic  and  this  amount  is  then listed as zero.  Polyboost
     suggests that you won't need to cache diskette drives if you have
     a hard drive;  depending on your mode of operation,  that may  be
     true.

     All  the  programs  except  for Polyboost will cache several hard
     disks from the same cache with only one loading  of  the  control
     software.  Polyboost  requires  multiple loading of its hard disk
     cache which has two  unfortunate  consequences:  you  double  the
     overhead  involved  with  the cache control software and you must
     dedicate memory as associated with either one hard  disk  or  the
     other; this isn't useful if you tend to work on one hard disk for
     a  while  and  then  switch to the other.  Polyboost's caching is
     limited to two hard disks.  Two of the programs,  Quickcache  and
     Speedcache,  use  an  "advanced"  EMS  call  not supported in the
     current version of the Xebec Amnesia board software which  I  was
     using; therefore, I am not able to report their memory usage.  In
     this  instance,  Speedcache  printed  an error message and exited
     without loading and Quickcache crashed the system.

          (Table 1 goes here)


     Time tests

     Table 2 shows the results of time tests.  The tests are  intended
     to  be  "real  world"  tests.  Tests  1-4 are tests of cache read
     functions.  Test 1 is the time to sort a 140K database that I had
     just sorted a different way.  This demonstrates the  savings  you
     would get from repeated access to a database.  Test 2 is the time
     to spell check a 40K document through the first pass which checks
     for possible misspellings.  Test 3 is the time it took to convert
     a  500K database from one version of a database I had to another.
     Test 4 is the time to compile, link and EXE2BIN a 100K file which
     I had just treated by MASM,  LINK and EXE2BIN on a hard disk  and
     edited.  This  is  typical  of  a  situation  where you may get a
     compiler error, correct the source file, and then recompile.

     Test 5 and 6 test the ability to speed up disk  writing.  Test  5
     is  a  PC Magazine "write random sectors" test.  This test writes
     the same data repeatedly to sectors which may be the same and  so
     FidoNews 4-27                Page 12                  20 Jul 1987


     it  is  particularly  sensitive  to  the trick that caches use of
     suppressing a rewrite of  identical  data  to  what  was  earlier
     written  to  disk.  Test  6  is a patched version of test 5 which
     writes different data each time.  It was supplied to  me  by  the
     publisher  of  Super PC-Kwik but I think it is a more significant
     test than the original test 5.

     The remaining tests attempt to check cache  overhead  or  special
     elements  and are not as significant.  Test 7 is the time it took
     to copy 10 files adding to 350K from a hard disk to a floppy  and
     test 8 is the same for a floppy to floppy copy.

     Tests 9, 10 and 11 are Norton's disk test program on a hard disk,
     1.2  megabyte  floppy,  and  regular  floppy,  respectively.  The
     Norton tests are included because the results  are  so  dramatic.
     These  dramatic  speed  increases over DOS are due mainly to read
     ahead as can be seen by running Super PC-Kwik  with  this  option
     turned  off.  The  copy tests check on whether there is time lost
     because of cache overhead.

     The three columns listing DOS nn are tests done with no cache and
     nn buffers.  Tests 1,  2,  4,  5 and 6 were also done  from  a  1
     megabyte RAM disk and Test 3 using two 1 megabyte RAM disks.  For
     vague  comparison  purposes only,  three other times are reported
     within asterisks:  The time for a Norton disk test on a  2.4  Meg
     RAM  disk (#9),  and the times to copy the same set of files used
     in Tests 7 and 8 from a hard disk to a RAM disk (as #7) and  from
     one RAM disk to another (as #8).

     All  the  tests are done on a Kaypro 286i with a Xebec EMS board.
     To check how much overhead EMS causes,  I ran the tests for Super
     PC-Kwik  in  both  EMS and conventional memory.  This overhead is
     due to the lack of DMA  support  in  EMS  and  not  to  the  bank
     switching.  Since  I  could  not get Quickcache and Speedcache to
     run under this EMS setup,  I  did  their  tests  in  conventional
     memory   which  gives  them  a  slight  advantage.   I  used  the
     recommended number of DOS buffers with buffers=20 in those  cases
     with no recommendation about decreasing the number of buffers.  I
     used  256K  of cache.  For all the tests but Tests 8,  10 and 11,
     the cache was only  hard  disk  for  those  programs  (Polyboost,
     Vcache) with separate diskette caches.  For Vcache, I used a 240K
     vs. 24K split between disk and diskette caches and for Polyboost,
     which  requires separate caches for each diskette,  I used a 256K
     hard disk cache and 16K for each diskette.

         (Table 2 goes here)

     First,  the test results illustrate the importance of  increasing
     buffers  above  the  default 2 or 3 if you are not using a cache;
     they also illustrate that there is a break point where  too  many
     buffers can hurt you.  On things that caches do well (Tests 1-4),
     caches are competitive with RAM disks.

     On Test #1 which is the most typical application of a cache,  the
     cache programs all  showed  the  same  rather  substantial  gain.
     While there is a some spread on the other figures, the read tests
     FidoNews 4-27                Page 13                  20 Jul 1987


     really  don't  distinguish  between  the  different  caches.   On
     writing,  I'd give the nod to Super PC-Kwik and note that none of
     the  tests adequately check for caching writes.  The lack of this
     feature in Emmcache made me lean  towards  Super  PC-Kwik.  While
     Super  PC-Kwik stands out as special in a positive way on writes,
     it also stands out negatively on diskette copies.

     While on the  subject  of  time  tests,  I  should  mention  that
     Lightning allows you to call up a screen which tells you how much
     time  you  have  saved  by using the cache.  Its figures are pure
     fairy tale!  I found that often it told me that I'd saved time in
     situations  where  I'd  actually  taken  more  time  than   using
     buffers=20.  Presumably,  it was using some algorithm giving me a
     comparison  on  some  kind  of  slow  8088  based  machine   with
     buffers=2.  Super  PC-Kwik  and  Vcache  will  give  you the more
     accurate listing of the number of accesses that  have  been  from
     the cache as opposed to disk accesses.


     Screen Speedup

     Polyboost and Vcache come with screen speedup programs; Polyboost
     also  has a keyboard speedup program which I did not test.  Table
     3 shows tests that I did in typing the  same  111K  file  to  the
     screen  that  I  used in my earlier articles on console software.
     RAW is a program which turns  on  DOS'  raw  mode  (see  February
     Monitor).  The  tests with the CRTBOST and EGABOOST programs that
     come with Polyboost are done with their optional  parameters  set
     to  1  and  to  5.  Setting  this parameter to 6 is equivalent to
     setting it to 5 and turning RAW on. Setting the parameter to 1 is
     recommended for most users.  Times  are  given  in  seconds.  For
     comparison,  times  are  given  for  some  of  the  other  screen
     management programs that I have considered.  Fansi Console has  a
     "quick" parameter which can be turned on and off.

     While the times on EGA/CRTBOOST are impressive, it has some bugs.
     When EGABOOST was installed, even with its speed parameter set to
     the  slowest value (1),  I was unable to change monitors on a two
     monitor system with either DOS' MODE command or a  public  domain
     program  that  I  use.  There are programs that require me to use
     Fansi's capability to turn Q=1  on  and  off  from  BATch  files.
     These  programs do not work properly with CRTBOOST at its highest
     settings.  You can change to a setting where  they  do  work  but
     only  with  a  menu  driven utility.  Finally,  both CRTBOOST and
     VSCREEN suffer from the defect  that  screen  speedup  can  be  a
     disadvantage  if  you don't also have screen scrolling memory.  I
     have not tested all screen scrolling memory programs  with  these
     two   speedup   programs   but   I'd   expect   at   least   some
     incompatibilities.  Fansi comes with  its  own  screen  scrolling
     memory which even supports EMS.


     Summary

     Lightning  comes in both copy protected and unprotected versions;
     indeed,  the price difference  is  so  great  that  I'd  call  it
     FidoNews 4-27                Page 14                  20 Jul 1987


     ransomware.  Because  you'll  want to load the program as part of
     your autoexec.bat and the copy protection  is  of  the  key  disk
     version,  you  will really need the unprotected variety.  All the
     other programs are not copy protected.

     It seems to me that these programs,  as  a  group,  are  somewhat
     overpriced.  They  are  subtle but not that complicated as can be
     seen by the fact that the main programs are typically  about  5K.
     Indeed, in cost per byte, they may be the most expensive class of
     programs on the market.

     On  the  basis  of time tests alone,  it is difficult to pick one
     among these programs.  Your choice will have to depend on factors
     like the amount of conventional memory they use,  the  particular
     characteristics of your system as they relate to issues like read
     ahead, and price.

     Thom Henderson, 1:107/6.1
     System Enhancement Associates, Inc.

                               Announcing MGM
                         A New Conferencing System


     System  Enhancement  Associates has now released a public version
     of the MGM Group Mail System.  MGM is specifically  designed  for
     SEAdog systems operating as points, but parts of it are useful in
     a wide variety of other applications.  MGM can be  configured  to
     be  fully  compatible  with the current standard FidoNet echomail
     system.

     MGM is different from other conferencing systems in that it takes
     a  highly modular approach.  While this is not as fast as a fully
     integrated system, it offers much greater flexibility.  Parts may
     be  added,  subtracted,   or  rearranged  almost  at  whim.   New
     functions  can  be  added  merely by adding another module to the
     system.


     MGM is being distributed as a series of archives, as follows:

     MGMDOCS.ARC   This contains the complete  documentation  for  the
                   MGM  system.  You  may  wish  to  peruse this first
                   before selecting which parts of the MGM system  you
                   wish to use.

     MGMARCM.ARC   This  contains  version  1.00  of  the ARCmail mail
                   packet  archiver.   Version  1.00   includes   such
                   features  as  archived  message  routing,  enclosed
                   files, and alternate directory usage.

     MGMCLEAN.ARC  This contains a utility for automating the deletion
                   of duplicate messages caused by faulty topology.

     MGMEDIT.ARC   This contains a full screen editor for  maintaining
                   conference link map files (AREAS.BBS files).

     MGMFWD.ARC    This  contains  the  MGM  message forwarder.  It is
                   self-levelling  to  adjust  to  traffic  loads  and
                   system   capabilities.   It   is  also  capable  of
                   forwarding files as well as messages.

     MGMLINK.ARC   This  contains  the  MGM  link  query  program.  It
                   allows  queries  and  responses  to  a  distributed
                   database of group mail topology,  allowing  you  to
                   locate  links  to  new  conferences  easily.   Both
                   direct links and indirect links of any  length  are
                   detected.

     MGMMGM.ARC    This   contains  the  MGM  program  itself,   which
                   performs  the   traditional   "toss"   and   "scan"
                   functions,   with   some   interesting  variations,
                   including the ability to regenerate  reply  threads
     FidoNews 4-27                Page 16                  20 Jul 1987


                   and  the ability to send direct network mail out of
                   a group mail area.

     MGMORIG.ARC   This  contains  the  ECHORIG program that recreates
                   message origins based on the "origin  lines",  thus
                   allowing  private  netmail  replies  out of a group
                   mail areas.

     MGMPMAP.ARC   This  contains the PointMap program,  which permits
                   network mail to and from nodes on a point  network.
                   Support  is  provided  for  crash priority mail and
                   file attaches to be forwarded to or from the  point
                   network.   Full   addressing  (including  interzone
                   addressing) is supported.

     MGMPOINT.ARC  Almost  everything  in  this  archive  is  included
                   elsewhere in the  MGM  set  of  archives.  However,
                   this  one archive contains everything needed to set
                   up a SEAdog system as a point in a private network.
                   Included is the PointUp  program  for  quickly  and
                   easily   reconfiguring   of   a  SEAdog  for  point
                   operation.


     The MGM system is available by SEAdog file request from 107/6  or
     107/528. 107/528 is available at 1200 baud 24 hours a day.  107/6
     is  available  only  between the hours of 1800 and 0900,  Eastern
     Daylight Time.  Please do not request these files during National
     Mail Hour.

                                Campaign Platform of
                                    Mark Grennan
                                    147/1 - 19/0

          Because its hard to know who to vote for, if you don't know what
          the candidates stands for, I felt I should inform everyone why
          I'm running for the IFNA Board of Directors.

          Here are the issues as I see them.

          Is IFNA needed?  YES.  As FidoNet grows it becomes more and more
          unmanageable.  So far we have been lucky.  Ken and Ben have done
          a good job supplying us with a nodelist every week for the last
          150+ weeks, but some day our luck has to end. Before it does I'd
          like to assure FidoNet doesn't end with it. I feel IFNA`s first
          job, is to keep the net running.

          Who owns the FidoNet?  No simple answer here.  IFNA owns the
          nodelist, Tom Jennings owns the name, but I feel the people in
          the nodelist own the network.  Without Tom we could change the
          name, and without IFNA we can find someone else to create the
          nodelist each week, but without all the sysops there is no net.
          If I am elected to the BOD I promises to listen to every sysop
          who has a concern on how the net is run.  I'm not saying I will
          treat non-IFNA members the same as IFNA members.  Only IFNA
          members can have any control over how their money is spent. IFNA
          should not be a governing body, it should be a support group that
          promotes FidoNet.

          How should IFNA spend it money?  Besides using it to create the
          nodelist and help new sysops with information on how to get a
          node number, I feel IFNA should spend some of its money to make
          sure FidoNet remains an open architecture.  It looks  like there
          are a lot of people who would like to make a buck off FidoNet.
          There nothing wrong with making a buck. But, it would be in their
          best interest to keep all of the technical information on how a
          mailer and its protocols work, to themselves.  I feel IFNA, as
          soon as it can, should publish a book something like the Ham
          radio handbook, on how to start your own bbs. Including
          information on how to write your own mailer.  The technical
          standards we have now should be expanded, and source code to a
          working mailer should be included as a model.

          Should censorship be allowed?  Hell No!  I can't believe anyone
          is standing up for this.  If someone wants to censor the messages
          on his/her board, thats their business. If a person offers to
          pass along an echo, they don't have the right to censor other
          peoples mail.

          If you have any question or would get like to give me your
          views, please send your message to 19/0, 147/1 or call me
          (VOICE) at 405-728-9836.

     Bill Crawford, OpusNODE 362/1
     Chattanooga, Tennessee
     615/892-7773 (1200/2400)

                          COMPUTER BUILDING BLOCKS

          If you've looked carefully through  Radio  Shack's  computer
     catalog, you've found that many options exist for your computers.
     There  is  a  table  listing the various video resolution options
     along with monitors and -- for the Tandy  3000s  --  the  plug-in
     video boards required for each.

          You will also find a variety of storage options including 5-
     1/4" drives for 360Kb and 1.2Mb,  a 3-1/2" drive for 760Kb (we'll
     have one this summer to match IBM's new 1.44Mb  format),  a  20Mb
     hard  card,  hard  disks  in  20,  40,  and 70Mb sizes,  and disk
     cartridge systems in various configurations.

          With  IBM's  latest  product  announcements,   the  idea  of
     "hardware  compatibility" went up in a puff of smoke.  We believe
     our ongoing strategy of providing the building blocks to let  you
     "custom  tailor"  your  computer  system,  is now more valid than
     ever.  It also means you can add any level  of  connectivity  any
     time you need it. But... you don't pay for it until -- or if--the
     need arises.

          This  building block system has obvious advantages in price,
     convenience,  and future expandability.  You pay for exactly (and
     only) the system you want.

          To  see how this helps,  consider an example.  Let's say you
     chose an IBM Model 50,  but you want a  larger  and  faster  hard
     drive  than  the  "standard"  20Mb unit.  That drive fits nothing
     other than IBM's Model 50.  Every 50 owner already has  one,  and
     the  dealer sure doesn't need to take it on trade.  If you really
     must have a different HD,  the 20Mb unit you've already paid  for
     is now a throwaway!

          So,  you can start with a 1-drive Tandy 3000HL (which by the
     way is on sale for $1299 this month), add a hard disk,  and still
     save  a bundle when compared to the Model 50's $3599 tab.  By the
     way,  in "real-world" application benchmarks,  we find the 3000HL
     to run at about 90% the speed of the Model 50. And of course with
     a  80286 processor,  it will run the next generation (OS-2 based)
     software when it's available.

          This building  block  philosophy  is  something  we've  been
     working  toward  for  some time.  We announced an external 3-1/2"
     drive for the Tandy 1000EX last summer,  and our internal  3-1/2"
     was  in  the  January computer catalog.  We believe it will prove
     beneficial for all Tandy computer users.

                             IBM's MICROCHANNEL

          We  are  asked  often  if  we  intend  to  copy  IBM's   new
     Microchannel  bus  for future '286 and '386 computers.  The first
     FidoNews 4-27                Page 19                  20 Jul 1987


     question the industry must answer is what  user  advantages  that
     bus  may  offer.  Since  there  won't be any advantage until OS-2
     based software is available (1991?),  we all have  some  time  to
     decide and react...  if any reaction is appropriate. (Helping IBM
     get a temporary "leg up" on their competition  isn't  much  of  a
     user benefit.)

          If  there  are  benefits  to  the  Microchannel,   are  they
     universal,  or do they only have  appeal  to  the  two  to  three
     hundred largest corporations. Do they offset the disadvantages of
     incompatibility  with  installed  systems  and software,  and the
     inability to use existing add-on boards and monitors.

          It's conceivable that we  could  end  up  with  an  industry
     standard  for  small and medium-size businesses,  home and school
     users...  and an IBM standard primarily appealing to the  largest
     corporate users to whom connectivity is of prime importance.  The
     jury is still out,  not just  for  us,  but  for  all  compatible
     vendors.  Consumers,  not vendors set standards.  Ultimately, YOU
     will decide,  and our goal will be to  offer  the  best  possible
     value, within those standards.

                     TANDY 1000 OWNERS GET MS-DOS 3.20

          Those  of  you with a Tandy 1000 SX already own this version
     of MS- DOS.  But now owners of the original 1000 and  the  1000EX
     can  get  it.  Catalog  Number  is 25-1170 ($29.95).  If you want
     detailed documentation on the new commands in 3.20,  you'll  also
     want a 25-1508 ($29.95) DOS Reference Manual.

                          NEW PRODUCT - SMARTWATCH

          Here's  one  I  think will be of special interest to lots of
     Tandy 1000 SX, 1200,  and other PC compatible owners.  Most of us
     tire  quickly  of entering the date and time every time we power-
     up.  There  have  always  been  clock  board  solutions,  usually
     combined   with   mouses   or  other  functions,   but  often  at
     considerable cost.

          Now there's a product called SmartWatch (Cat. No.  25-1033),
     which sells for only $39.95.  Better yet, it doesn't even require
     a card slot!  SmartWatch installs into the socket  for  the  BIOS
     ROM  in  a  piggyback fashion.  It's customer installable in most
     cases.

                       TANDY 1000 (ORIGINAL) DESKMATE

          We're still receiving  a  number  of  software  registration
     cards  from  Tandy  1000  owners who are registering the original
     Deskmate product,  version 1.0.  Check your version.  You  should
     have version 1.1.  We advised 1.0 owners to take a blank diskette
     to your local Radio Shack and have them back up the  new  version
     onto your disk.

          You  often see stats for top selling software in the general
     market. Have you wondered about what the top sellers are in Radio
     Shack stores? Well, here's how it looked for the latest reporting

                        UPGRADE FOR TANDY 2000 WORD

          I believe I reported to you  here  that  Tandy  2000  owners
     could  upgrade  their  1.0  version of Microsoft Word to 3.1,  by
     contacting Microsoft directly. It appears that I spoke too soon.

          Microsoft is working on that upgrade, but it isn't available
     yet.  Our people will let me know when it's ready,  and I'll  try
     to keep you updated. Sorry for the error.

                       NEW PRODUCTS  COMING THIS YEAR

          At  the  recent  meeting of the Tandy business user's group,
     TANGENT, our product management people were asked by the users if
     we intended to have a product  using  the  80386  processor.  The
     reply was that we would have one in the second half of this year.
     Our  users  also  asked  whether  or  not  we  would have a laser
     printer. The response was the same...  before the year's end.  No
     further details were discussed.

                           FUN messing with USERS
                                     or
                              I'll be Dutched

     Oswego Opus was a very busy board before The OTHER Side  came  to
     live  and  since then it has become increasingly difficult to log
     on.

     Just as the problems arise technology comes to the rescue and now
     we have Dutchie.  For those of you who understand more about  BBS
     software  Dutchie  is  much  like SeaDog except it is P/D.  I use
     SeaDog as a front end and so SeaDog  answers  the  phone  and  if
     there  isn't another SeaDog or Dutchie talking to it,  it assumes
     there is a human calling and transfers control to the BBS  or  in
     my  case  a  program  called  CHOOSER that asks you which BBS you
     want.

     Now when it comes to running a BBS you soon learn that  there  is
     only  so  many  hours in a day and both reading messages and file
     transferring takes time (a lot of time).  Now my preference is to
     the messages but since I offer probably more files then  probably
     any  other  BBS  in the NW the machine is tied up a great deal of
     the time going ack ack.

     Enter Dutchie.  Dutchie offers  two  things  to  help  solve  the
     problem.  For  the  file fanatics they can set up a Dutchie POINT
     and use dutchie to file request files. They no longer have to log
     on and search,  they just ask for a file by name and  SeaDog  and
     Dutchie  do  the  rest.  The  real  savings in time come from the
     message base users.

     The message base user can set up a POINT and now  spend  as  much
     time  reading and writing as they wish to but only be on line for
     1 to 2 minutes. Think of the users that don't call because of the
     long distance charges.  Now they can  participate  and  keep  the
     charges next to nil.

     What  I  hoped to do was provide a turnkey installation pack that
     would allow a POINT to have me as the BOSS and not  be  concerned
     with anything else.


                   Creating POINTS for use with ECHOMAIL


     This  is  a basic package to self install a POINT off of your BBS
     and use ECHOMAIL to share message bases.  I am  going  to  assume
     two  things,  first that your user is a novice with the desire to
     do nothing other then share your message bases.  Second  is  that
     your  user isn't going to buy Bob Hartman's FASTTOSS/SCAN package
     (which would have simplified matters).

     If you and  your  points  use  Bob  Hartman's  new  FASTTOSS  and
     FASTSCAN  then  you  can  skip  the next ## paragraphs.  Remember
     though that your  POINTS  need  to  use  FASTSCAN  as  well.  Bob
     Hartman is making site (node) licenses available, contact him for
     FidoNews 4-27                Page 23                  20 Jul 1987


     details.

     In  using  SCANmail you must remember that each point MUST have a
     MAIL.SYS which YOU must create individually for each  POINT.  You
     must  go  into OPUS/FIDO and reset YOUR matrix (net/node) to what
     you want your point's to be,  exit  and  copy  MAIL.SYS  to  your
     Dutchie  support  files  area.  Then  reset  it  to your original
     number (I create several at a time to save confusion).

     Next you need to create two NODELIST.BBS's, The first one is your
     private nodelist with you as host (I add ten nodes at a time  and
     assign them afterwards,  I was able to do this because I will not
     be sending mail,  they MUST poll me for it  (remember  that  they
     aren't  running  a  BBS  so they aren't dedicating a phone line).
     The second nodelist has one node (number unimportant) and me, the
     BOSS (host).  This nodelist is for the POINT to use.  Once  again
     I  want  to  say  that  this  is a single point that will only be
     sharing echomail with me.

     For Dutched to work properly you need to build a DUTCHIE.ARE file
     that list the sub directory paths and areas name.  Your user will
     now  have  a  directory  to the different message/echo areas.  My
     DUTCHIE.ARE for OSWEGO Opus looks like.

         \dutchie\general\ AREA 1 - General Message area
         \dutchie\buy-sell\ AREA 2 - Local Buy and Sell
         \dutchie\pnw.tech\ AREA 3 - MS DOS Technical
         \dutchie\humor\ AREA 4 - Jokes and Humor
         \dutchie\sex\ AREA 5 - Sex in today's society
         \dutchie\de-bait\ AREA 6 - Religion and Philosophy
         \dutchie\politics\ AREA 7 - Continental Politics
         \dutchie\i-polit\ AREA 8 - International Politics
         \dutchie\calendar\ AREA 9 - Portland/Vancouver Events
         \dutchie\vanport\ AREA 10 - Portland/Vancouver Chatter

     My install bat creates all the sub directories for the POINTS  so
     the  data  paths  are  correct.  The  INS-**.BAT  is  started  in
     C:\DUTCHIE and creates the sub directories and un  arcs  all  the
     files  and  then deletes the .ARC's Remember that this package is
     for the NOVICE and the more time you spend refining it  the  less
     time  you  will  spend  debugging  it.  I have found that my best
     message base users are not the TECHIES.

     To be able  to  scan  their  mail  for  you  they  have  to  have
     system*.bbs  files.  I  created  them to correspond to my message
     bases and includes EDSYS in the support package in case I add  or
     delete  areas.   I  also  created  a  TOSS.BAT,   SCAN.BAT,   and
     RENUMBER.BAT so they can  maintain  the  message  bases.  As  for
     simplified installation I created a install bat (INS-**.BAT) that
     does  EVERYTHING  but  edit their ** DUTCHIE.CTL file.  The whole
     package consist of six files and a README.1ST file which is typed
     out below.

     Also we need to create AREAS#.BBS for them as well,  they need to
     corespond  to  the SYSTEM#.BBS files and have our node listed for
     scanning purposes.
     FidoNews 4-27                Page 24                  20 Jul 1987


     I  have  included  all  the  DOCS  and  had  them   copied   into
     C:\DUTCHIE\DOCS but don't expect anyone to read them so I wrote a
     README.2ND  file  which is basically a basic set of instructions.
     It covers invoking  DUTCHIE/DUTCHED,  and  the  SCAN,  TOSS,  and
     RENUMBER batch files and includes Henks DUTCHED - editor docs.

     ** Be very sure they edit the cfg file as it has their name, node
        number  and  your  phone number in it.  Also be very sure they
        have the correct com port and max baud or they won't  be  able
        to initialize their modem.



                           Installing your POINT

     You  now have all the workings of a Dutchie point,  This setup is
     different then what the Dutchie docs recommend  **PLEASE**  don't
     mess with it or it won't work as a 1:105/10 point.

     You have chosen one of six different point packages.

     **For HARD Disk Drives **

      1. POINT of The OTHER Side  -----------------------
                                             (SUP-H1.ARC)
                                             (INS-H1.BAT)
      2. POINT of OSWEGO Opus  --------------------------
                                             (SUP-H2.ARC)
                                             (INS-H2.BAT)
      3. POINT of both The OTHER Side and OSWEGO Opus  --
                                             (SUP-HB.ARC)
                                             (INS-HB.BAT)
     ** For Floppy Disk Drives **

      4. POINT of The OTHER Side  -----------------------
                                             (SUP-F1.ARC)
                                             (INS-F1.BAT)
      5. POINT of OSWEGO Opus  --------------------------
                                             (SUP-F2.ARC)
                                             (INS-F2.BAT)
      6. POINT of both The OTHER Side and OSWEGO Opus  --
                                             (SUP-FB.ARC)
                                             (INS-FB.BAT)

     If  you have the wrong SUPPORT packages delete it NOW and get the
     correct one.  You  also  MUST  get  a  file  called  MAIL.SYS  or
     SYSTEM.DOG  from  the  SYSLOP.  This  is  a unique file with your
     point address imbedded in it.  If you don't get the  correct  one
     then things won't work right.

     IF everything is in order then proceed.

     ** HARD Disk **

     Create  a sub directory called dutchie on drive "C" and then copy
     these  files  into  it.  Then  run  install*.bat.  After  running
     FidoNews 4-27                Page 25                  20 Jul 1987


     install read README.2ND, and then print it for reference.

     ** FLOPPY Disk **

     Un   ARC   DUTCHIE.ARC   onto   a  single  floppy  and  label  it
     DUTCHIE/DUTCHED,  This is your Dutchie communication and  Dutched
     editor disk.  Un ARC SUP-F*.ARC onto a second floppy and label it
     DUTCHIE MAINTENANCE,  this disk will handle the TOSS,  SCAN,  and
     RENUMBER maintenance on the message disk.  Use the INS-F*.BAT  to
     create your drive B: message floppy.

     To run Dutchie place the DUTCHED/DUTCHIE disk in drive A: and the
     MESSAGE  disk  in  drive  B:  and  type  DUTCHIE <return>.  To do
     maintenance replace the DUTCHIE/DUTCHED floppy with  the  DUTCHIE
     MAINTENANCE floppy.



     I  have  includes  a list of files that are in the three archives
     that make up the DUTCHIE.ARC, SUP-H or F*.ARC, and DOCS.ARC

     SEAdog/FIDO 100/517
     St Louis, MO

                   True 24 Hour Mail (part II of routing)

     Last week I covered the routing files for mail pickup.  This week
     I will be going over the scheduling. If you don't use SEAdog as a
     front-end system, I suggest you look into it.

     What  we want to be able to do here is have the ability to run 24
     hour mail,  while at the same time allow calls to make it through
     to our BBS. We need SEAdog for this.

     Here's the little routing we set up last week:

         at 1:00 AM we poll 1000/1
         at 3:30 AM we route mail to our host
         at 4:00 AM we run the Natl Mail hour
         at 5:00 AM we hold mail for 1000/2

     In  your  CONFIG.DOG  file,  or  schedule  file,  you  should see
     something like this:

         event E all 1:00 1:15                   ;poll 1000/1
         event G all 3:30 4:00                   ;local routing
         event A all 4:00 5:00                   ;Natl Mail
         event F all 5:00 5:15                   ;hold 1000/2

     Now,  let's turn our SEAdog into that 24 hour  mail  system  that
     will give and take mail packets and files.

     During  all  the  non-scheduled  times  you need to run this next
     event.  First, let's look at the configuration that also contains
     a  couple of external events so you can see how to fit everything
     together.

     (BEFORE 24 hour mail:)

         event  E  all  1:00 1:15                ;poll 1000/1
         event  X1 all  2:00                     ;toss mail
         event  G  all  3:30 4:00                ;local routing
         event  A  all  4:00 5:00                ;Natl Mail
         event  F  all  5:00 5:15                ;hold 1000/2
         event  X5 all  7:00                     ;print userlogs

     To add the 24 hour mail, we need to define a route. We'll use tag
     J. It needs to go into your CONFIG.DOG file as:

         Schedule J                              ;24 hour mail
         HOLD    ALL

         SEND-TO ALL
         GIVE-TO ALL

     The key to making this  all  work  is  how  we  set  up  our  new

     NOTES:

     - during tag J events,  make sure that you use the BBS delimiter.
       This allows callers to access your bulletin board.

     - If you run FIDO or OPUS,  make  sure  that  you  have  matching
       events  in  you event scheduler.  But,  in stead of running the
       events from the BBS software, just have it exit to DOS, and let
       SEAdog run the events.  Also,  don't put your Tag J events into
       your BBS schedules.

     Well!  That's it.  If you have any questions about the  way  I've
     explained routing, etc, net mail me at 100/517.

     Have  you  requested  your copy of MSGDB.ARC yet?  (a great SYSOP
     utility) You  can  request  this  file  from  either  100/510  or
     100/517.

     Next week, a litle broadcasting news. And that's the way it was..

                    -- The Regular Irregular Column --
                                Dale Lovell
                                  157/504

          Well,  this  week  has  almost  been  boring.  The new AT is
     performing  beautifully,  and  if  it  continues  working  I will
     probably  end  up  changing  the  Hercules  card in it to the EGA
     Wonder card over in  the XT  clone. The   only  problems I've had
     involve  the  limitations  of  the  Hercules  monographics  card.
     Considering the  low cost  of a  Hercules board  and monitor, the
     nice resolution,  and how  easy it is on my eyes (as opposed to a
     CGA board and monitor)  I  can't  see  why  more  companies don't
     support it.  Oh well, maybe someday it too shall come to pass. In
     the meantime  I've discovered  a few  work arounds,  more on that
     later. First off is the unfortunate correction department.

     -- Oopps.... Corections --

          Last  time  around  I  ended  up going over the partitioning
     software that came with  my Miniscribe  hard drive,  Speedstor. I
     thought the  list price  was $99 (it came "free" with the drive).
     I'm not sure where I came up with that figure, but the  day after
     I sent  the column  in to Thom I came across an ad for Speedstor.
     The correct list price is $79. I found their ad in the back of PC
     Magazine. I understand from some friends that they also advertise
     in the back sections of PC Week and BYTE.

     -- Troubles in the Clone World --

          A friend of mine recently acquired  an ARC  AT compatible at
     work. Someone  left the company, and he was quick to lay claim to
     the machine (he's been itching for  an AT  since he  saw how fast
     mine  runs).  A  mutual  friend  of ours had a large Toshiba disk
     drive that he wasn't using and decided to  lend it  to my friend.
     Armed with  the latest version of SpeedStor we set out to install
     the drive. While Speedstor doesn't actually give you full support
     of all  drive types,  it does  choose the closest drive supported
     and sets the drive type accordingly. The only problem is that the
     closest drive  type still  isn't good  enough for his ARC machine
     (his only lists 14 drive types).  Upon turning  the system  on he
     gets a  hard disk  error message  from the power on self test and
     has to press F1, after which the machine  does boot  off the hard
     disk. I  didn't think  that this would be a problem, just call up
     ARC and talk  to  technical  support.  Hopefully  they'd  have an
     update for his BIOS, and for a relatively small sum he could have
     BIOS support for 47 drive types like my  machine. There  was only
     one problem,  there was no technical support available for almost
     a month at the  number we  called. I  few calls  later we finally
     managed to get through to the person we should have gotten on the
     first call.  For $45  they'd send  us out  the new  BIOS. In case
     anyone  else  is  having  this  problem  with ARC, the number you
     should be calling is Sales at  1-800-423-3877 and  asking for the
     4.0 BIOS  for the ARC turbo AT (old turbo, the old BIOS reference
     number was 0403-030286). In spite of these problems,  I'd have to
     give  good  marks  to  ARC  on support. The only real problem was
     getting the right phone number, but  if you're  determined enough
     FidoNews 4-27                Page 30                  20 Jul 1987


     you can get through to the right people through the number listed
     in their ads.

     -- Hercules work arounds --

          In quite a few  of these  columns I've  lamented on  how few
     software manufacturers  support the  Hercules graphics card. They
     seem to assume that everyone has a CGA  system. In  the course of
     trying out some new (and not so new) software on my new system, I
     looked at some CGA simulators for Hercules cards. The best  one I
     came across  was SIMCGA  written by  Chuck Guzis. Included in the
     ARChive file  were three  programs; SIMCGA,  SETCGA, and SETMONO.
     SIMCGA has some problems in the text modes, mainly from no way to
     display shades. In it's CGA simulation mode it  can't display the
     monochrome  intensity  levels  or  underlining. To let people get
     around  this  limitation  easily,  they  include  the  SETCGA and
     SETMONO programs. The SIMCGA program is a memory-resident program
     that you will probably end up putting in  your autoexec.bat file.
     When  you  need  the  CGA  capabilities you merely run SETCGA and
     SIMCGA is now active. After you no longer need the  CGA emulation
     (say you're about to start up your word processor or some program
     that knows about Hercules cards) you run SETMONO and SIMCGA takes
     a backseat, staying in memory but not really doing anything. I've
     had quite a bit of luck with this program. It's been able  to run
     quite a  few programs that I hadn't been able to use on the AT. I
     haven't tried out GWBASIC, but it's  the best  CGA simulator I've
     seen yet.

          I originally  went out  and looked  for SIMCGA (on the local
     bulletin boards) because of a  game  that  arrived  in  the mail.
     While the  game ran  fine on  the old XT, I was curious as to how
     well it would run on the AT (and  how much  faster). I  called up
     the  software  company  and  was  able  to  talk  to one of their
     programmers. He asked me how I liked the  game and  if I  had any
     suggestions.  Well,  I  had  been  enjoying  the game and my only
     suggestion was to include  support for  the Hercules monographics
     boards. He  informed me  that they are working on support for the
     Hercules boards,  but haven't  been able  to automatically detect
     it's  presence.  They'd  like  to  be able to make everything run
     without requiring a person to enter any command  line switches. I
     wish  them  luck  in  getting  this worked out, and if anyone out
     there has any methods for detecting a Hercules  board please drop
     me a  line so I can pass it on.In any case the programmer told me
     that he had tested  it  with  a  shareware/public  domain program
     called  SIMCGA.  He  knew  of  a  board  in  his area that had it
     available for file requests and gave  me their  number in  case I
     couldn't find  it locally. I looked around the Cleveland bulletin
     boards first, and found it on one of the local FidoNet boards. It
     does run  a little  faster in  sections on  the AT, and I got the
     double bonus of finding a good utility to keep around at the same
     time. What game do I hear you asking? Look down at the end of the
     column for the answer as I really have been enjoying it.

     -- Microsoft and C --

          I started off these columns by going over the compiler I had
     FidoNews 4-27                Page 31                  20 Jul 1987


     just bought, Microsoft C version 4.0. Shortly after I bought my C
     compiler, Borland announced Turbo C and I was  curious as  to how
     Microsoft  would  respond  to  it.  After  all Quick Basic was in
     response to  Turbo  Pascal,  how  would  Microsoft  respond  to a
     product that  could cut  into their  sales of a high end product.
     Well, last week's visit to my local dealer  answered my question.
     He  had   received  a   visit  from  the  local  Microsoft  sales
     representative and  had  some  new  product  announcements. Among
     these announcements  were two  new C  products, C version 5.0 and
     Quick C. Version 5.0 is supposed  to  be  much  quicker,  have an
     improved version  of CodeView  and among other things is going to
     include Quick C. Their suggested retail  price on  the C compiler
     is going  to remain  at $450.  Quick C  on the other hand will be
     sold separately  and  will  cost  $99  according  to  the product
     announcement. Both  products will  be available in September, and
     anyone purchasing the current  C  compiler  after  June  1st will
     receive a  free upgrade  to version 5.0. The upgrade from version
     4.0, for those who purchased it before June 1st of  this year, is
     going to  be $75  (upgrades from any previous version is going to
     be $150). While Quick C is not going  to include  CodeView, it is
     supposed to be able to generate CodeView compatible code.

          I am planning on upgrading my version of C, and will let you
     know what I think of Quick C as  soon as  possible. I  think that
     this kind  of competition  can only  help out the marketplace. As
     Borland and Microsoft battle it out  for sales  of Quick/Turbo Cs
     and Basics,  we users  can only benefit. As each company enhances
     its product (to hopefully get  more  of  the  market)  people may
     start looking  at upgrade  policies, and support. Not only may we
     end up with better products quicker,  we  may  end  up  with much
     better  support  and  cheaper  upgrades.  Well,  maybe  not  that
     quickly... but a person can hope and dream, can't they?

          Incidentally, for awhile all I heard  about in  the echomail
     conferences on Turbo C was how it was "vaporware." I've talked to
     someone who  did  receive  Turbo  C  almost  as  soon  as  it was
     introduced. He had just received an "update" for his compiler. It
     seems that almost as soon as Turbo C was released Borland started
     discovering a  lot of  bugs in  the product. They decided to stop
     shipments on it until  they  had  been  fixed.  They  kept taking
     orders  for  Turbo  C  and  quickly  went back and fixed the bugs
     (hopefully all of them). The shipments everyone started receiving
     a few  weeks ago  (after a  long wait)  is the corrected version.
     While I haven't been able to confirm any of this, I am reasonably
     confident of my source.

     -- Winding down... --

          As  I  promised  last  week  and earlier in this column, I'm
     looking over a game this time  around. Twelve  Meter Challenge by
     Greylock  Software,  Inc.  (list  price  $50.00)  is  a realistic
     simulation of  yacht  racing,  the  America's  Cup  challenges in
     particular.  The  first  few  pages  of  the  manual give a brief
     history of the America's Cup that  I found  fascinating. The only
     deficiency  being  that  they  don't  include the recent race (in
     which we won back the cup) but end at the 1983 challenge in which
     FidoNews 4-27                Page 32                  20 Jul 1987


     Australia took  the cup  from it's  resting place at the New York
     Yacht  Club.  The  next  section  of   the  manual   is  a  basic
     introduction in  how to sail. Included is descriptions of all the
     terms that are going to be used throughout  the rest  of the book
     (like what  the difference is between coming about and jibing, or
     what those terms even mean).

          The simulation itself  offers  a  choice  among  5 different
     courses and  3 different  computer opponents. In the next release
     of Twelve Meter Challenge (you get  a free  upgrade to  this next
     version), you'll  also be  able to  race against a human opponent
     provided each of you has purchased the game  and own  a modem. In
     addition you  are capable of selecting how hard of an environment
     you wish to sail, the direction of the  race, the  race distance,
     the conditions for winning (one race, 2 out of 3, etc.), the days
     until the race, and  whether  the  racing  rules  should  be "on"
     (please  note  that  some  rules  can  NOT  be turned off). After
     selecting all this (and naming your  yacht club,  yacht name, and
     captain's name) the next step is to select your crew and non-crew
     members. Their are 76 possible candidates  to fill  the available
     positions and  while the minimum necessary is 10, you'll probably
     want to hire some extras and  some non-crew  members like  a fund
     raiser or  Sailmaker. While  selecting the  crew, you may wish to
     have a  security  agency  investigate  some  of  these applicants
     (keeping in  mind that detectives cost money). I've usually ended
     up hiring a detective  agency and  some security  guards (to help
     protect  against  spying  and  vandalism) at the same time. After
     selecting the crew I've gone on  and designed  the yacht  I'll be
     racing, as  well as  having it built. During the design phase you
     have several options to select for your yacht  (type of  mast and
     keel and  such) after  which time  it's advisable  to tank test a
     model of  the yacht  (I've heard  that if  you don't  tank test a
     model you run a risk of having your yacht fail to meet the twelve
     meter rule and be disqualified from  racing). You're  given three
     different bids from builders to choose from, and they all tend to
     have different rates (especially  for  their  company technicians
     and mechanics  if you  decide you  want them).  While I've always
     gone with  the most  expensive builder,  you may  not have enough
     money to  do this (I know I've come close to being broke a couple
     of times).

          After you're done  selecting  your  crew  and  building your
     yacht, it's time to train your crew. The training runs take place
     over the same course  you'll later  be racing  in, so  it pays to
     make a few runs to acquaint yourself with the course. I'm also of
     the opinion that it helps to acquaint your crew with  your manner
     of doing  things. At least I've always had better results if I go
     out for a few  training runs  before the  actual race. Eventually
     you'll have to begin the race (or races depending on the what you
     chose) and this is where the fun begins. While out  on a training
     run (or the actual race) you have a race console at the bottom of
     the screen and will be able to look around the boat in  45 degree
     increments (to check on your opponent or a buoy marker). The race
     console provides you with information on the rudder,  up to three
     sails, heading, speed, and wind conditions. The center display of
     the console is capable of giving you race  information; condition
     FidoNews 4-27                Page 33                  20 Jul 1987


     information  (bearing  and  distance  to the next marker and your
     opponent, current heading and  speed  and  true  wind information
     among  other  things;  or  a  map  of  the  course  with the buoy
     positions and your location (your opponent's location as well).

          Overall I've been greatly  impressed  by  this  game.  It is
     still providing  me with entertainment (for over 2 weeks now) and
     I still haven't tried out some  of the  more advanced  courses or
     opponents. While  I don't  think I'm  capable of actually sailing
     the real thing, it has made me aware of how much time, effort and
     skill  it  takes  to  sail  a  twelve  meter yacht. It isn't copy
     protected, and is easily installed on  a hard  disk. If  you have
     any further  inquires about Twelve Meter Challenge, you should be
     able to contact them  at 413/528-5555  for voice  or 413/528-5663
     for their  bulletin board  (FidoNet 321/132 if the new net number
     has been processed).

          Once again I'd like to hear from some  of you.  Whether it's
     on something  I've written about, or something you think I should
     write about.  Below  you'll  find  my  US  mail  address, FidoNet
     address,  and  uucp  address.  FidoNet  messages should be routed
     through 157/1 (or 157/0) as I'm a private node. I'm still looking
     for  some  good  advice  on  LANs, and I'd still like your return
     address "Ender Wiggin."

     FIDO lost one of it's own on Friday.  Don Brauns,  Sysop 102/631,
     died,  after a long running battle with Lupus and heart  disease,
     on the morning of July 10th, 1987.

     Don  was  well  known  to most of us as the Sysop of Rainbow Data
     Systems FIDO and one of the pioneers  of  the  FIDO  network.  He
     helped  many  of  us to become part of the FIDO family.  His loss
     will leave an empty spot in all of our lives.

     He is survived by two sons and a daughter.

     A wake will be held on Sunday, 19 July, 1987 at Shakeys in Culver
     City at the corner of Sepulveda and Jefferson at 2 P.M.
