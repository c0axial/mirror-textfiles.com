                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================

     This week's editorial is by an anonymous author.

         Challenging the Right of an Information Industry to Exist!


     The "Information Industry" is presumed  to  include  any  company
     that  collects  information,  using  intelligence  or  technology
     sources,  and which then sells  that  information  somehow  to  a
     limited  audience.  For  the purposes of argument,  that industry
     includes the media  (TV,  newspapers)  as  well  as  conventional
     research agencies, analysts, and so on.

     1) Suppose a private weather bureau receives information from its
        privately-owned satellite indicating that a major hurricane is
        about  to strike the Florida coast.  This information is given
        to the firm's private  clients  who  have  subscribed  to  its
        weather  service  but not to the general public.  As a result,
        since no other weather service detects the storm in  time  and
        none  of  the  clients divulge the information to non-clients,
        thousands of people are killed and billions of  dollars  worth
        of property is destroyed.

        Counter-argument:  This  wouldn't  happen;  the  bureau  would
        reveal its knowledge out of humanitarianism or in an effort to
        gain publicity.  Rebuttal:  that the bureau would do so simply
        proves that certain information cannot, should not, may not be
        considered private.

     2) Suppose a private company starts an On-Line Service (OLS). OLS
        obtains  non-exclusive rights to store copyrighted articles in
        its  database,  which  can  be  searched  easily  using  fancy
        retrieval   techniques.   OLS   also   obtains   public-domain
        information  from  government  documents  and  non-copyrighted
        publications.  The  information  base grows rapidly,  and soon
        OLS becomes a very useful tool in gathering information.

        If the OLS database is  used  to  search  for  a  solution  to
        several  pressing  world  problems,  those  problems  could be
        solved more easily and millions of lives  would  be  enhanced.
        But OLS charges $10 per hour to access its database. These OLS
        charges are not affordable by some independent and government-
        funded  social  services researchers,  who consequently cannot
        collect the  information  necessary  to  solve  the  problems.
        Because  these  researchers do not have access to the informa-
        tion,   ten  million  more  people  die  of   starvation   and
        malnutrition before answers are found.


     Few  would argue with the comment in the first example,  that the
     private company is compelled,  morally and probably  by  law,  to
     reveal  its  privately-collected  information  to the public.  It
     would,  in fact,  be hard to pretend that any human  being  would
     Fidonews                     Page 3                   28 Apr 1986


     conceal that information.

     Few  would  argue that in the second example,  in which the exact
     cause and effect relationship is unprovable,  that  OLS  is  com-
     pelled  to  provide  free searches to all those who might benefit
     from them.  OLS needs to pay its expenses.  As a result, informa-
     tion will be partially overlooked.  While it is clear  that  free
     access  to  vast  databases  would  almost  certainly improve the
     quality of life, it is just as clear that such free access cannot
     be expected.

     As technology progresses,  it will be possible for more and  more
     information to be more and more accessible.  But because the cost
     of collecting information is not falling as rapidly as  the  cost
     of  "publishing"  and  distributing  it,  it  is quickly becoming
     obvious that more firms will  be  visibly  selling  "information"
     rather than "goods."

     And  as  it becomes obvious how advantageous it is to have access
     to wide libraries of information, what will the reaction be? Will
     information  collectors  be  permitted  to  charge  the   maximum
     possible  fee for their information,  thus limiting its distribu-
     tion?  Or will they be forced to sell that information at cost or
     to exchange it for free, thus reducing their incentive to collect
     the   information   and   in  turn  reducing  the  collection  of
     information?

     This is not an opinion: this is a question.

                    Comparing Kermit with Other Packages
                              by Frank da Cruz

     First let me say that  there  seem  to  be  two  major  kinds  of
     commercial  packages:  the  kind that use some variation of MODEM
     protocol,  and the kind that use their own proprietary protocols.
     First,  MODEM (please, any MODEM aficionados feel free to correct
     any of this)...

     MODEM and Kermit are similar in that they both use back-and-forth
     ACK/NAK  protocols  over  asynchronous  telecommunication  lines.
     However,  MODEM  sends  fixed-length  packets with 128 8-bit data
     bytes,  KERMIT sends variable length packets (up to 96 characters
     in  length) with either 7- or 8-bit data bytes.  The MODEM packet
     control fields use all 8 bits;  Kermit control fields only use 7.
     There are several consequences of all this:

     MODEM  can't  work  at  all  over a 7-bit channel,  even for text
     files,  because the checksum and other  control  fields  will  be
     wrong.  This  means  that MODEM can't be used over public packet-
     switched networks like TELENET, or with hosts that require use of
     character parity, like IBM mainframes.  Kermit can send both text
     and binary files over either 7-bit channels  or  8-bit  channels,
     but  the  data  gets  longer  if you have to squeeze it through a
     narrower hole.

     Certain computing or communication equipment  cannot  accept  128
     characters at a time.  Their buffers aren't that big.  Kermit can
     accommodate these systems, but MODEM cannot.

     Many  systems  cannot  accept all ASCII characters,  particularly
     control characters,  transparently.  MODEM provides no  mechanism
     for encoding otherwise taboo characters.

     Non-CPM systems, which do not necessarily allocate files in units
     of  128  bytes or follow the CTRL-Z end-of-file convention,  will
     often have junk at the end of a file received by MODEM.

     MODEM,  to the best  of  my  knowledge,  does  not  have  a  good
     mechanism for transmitting a group of files;  Kermit has it built
     into  the  protocol.   Kermit  protocol  also  includes  optional
     features for management of remote files; directory listings, file
     deletion,  quota  checking,  etc.  Many  of  the  Kermit programs
     support these optional features.

     MODEM sends the file bytes exactly as is,  whereas  Kermit  gives
     you some options for reformatting and compressing.  A "text" file
     is  transformed to "canonical form" by Kermit,  i.e.  a stream of
     ASCII  characters  with  the  "records"  (lines)   separated   by
     (encoded)  CR/LF  sequences,  so  that it may be stored in useful
     form on the target system.  Thus,  Kermit may be used on  record-
     oriented  systems (like IBM VM/CMS) or on stream-oriented systems
     like Unix where there record  boundaries  may  be  different  (LF
     instead of CRLF);  Kermits on those systems that don't store text
     files in the canonical manner do the appropriate conversions.  In
     addition, Kermit may also be told to send files as-is.
     Fidonews                     Page 6                   28 Apr 1986


     On the other  hand,  MODEM  works  nicely  between  like  systems
     (especially  CP/M  systems).  It's  more  efficient  than  Kermit
     because it doesn't have to encode and decode the  data,  and  the
     packets  are  somewhat longer.  Also,  much greater attention has
     been given in MODEM programs  to  modems  themselves,  and  MODEM
     programs  are  typically  able  to  control  dialout  modems from
     various manufacturers, and to run in "remote mode" when dialed up
     from the "back port" of  a  micro  (but  the  forthcoming  MS-DOS
     Kermit  will have this ability also).  MODEM provides the ability
     to dynamically switch  between  8-bit  and  16-bit  block  checks
     depending on the error rate;  KERMIT provides 6,  12,  and 16 bit
     block checks, but one of these must be selected ahead of time and
     will be used throughout the transfer.

     There's more,  but in short I think that,  on balance,  Kermit is
     more flexible and more easily adaptable to new systems; hence its
     rapid spread to a wide variety of micros, minis, and mainframes.

     Now,  as to commercial packages with proprietary protocols, well,
     who knows?  In some cases,  these protocols may  be  superior  to
     Kermit  in  every  way.  But  you  have certain problems with any
     commercial package:

     Are implementations available for all the systems you  want  them
     for?  If not,  will the vendor write the missing implementations?
     When?  For how much money?

     Does  the   protocol   make   assumptions   (like   full   duplex
     communication,  8-bit  data  path)  that  would  lock out certain
     classes of systems?

     Do you have enough money to buy the software  licenses  for  your
     mainframes  and  each  and  every one of your micros?  Some sites
     have thousands of micros.  A  typical  commercial  file  transfer
     package  costs  $500-$5000 dollars for the mainframe end and $50-
     $500 for each micro.

     Can your vendor  fix  bugs  in  a  timely  fashion?  If  you  had
     sources,  you  could  fix  them yourself,  but most vendors don't
     provide sources.

     Many commercial packages are very fancy, both in the protocol and
     the user interface.  But they often tend to be specially tailored
     to a certain combination of systems and/or  applications.  Kermit
     is not as fancy as a commercial product that knows how to dial up
     Dow-Jones and look up your stocks,  reformat the data as it comes
     in,  and display it in a color  pie  chart,  all  upon  a  single
     keystroke.  But  then  that  package probably can't exchange text
     and binary files with 50 or 60 different kinds of  systems  in  a
     relatively uniform and consistent way.

     Reprinted from the third edition of the SEAdog manual

     Reprinted by permission of SEA

                              SEAdog and Fido


     It is possible to run Fido under SEAdog.  SEAdog will answer  the
     phone  and  determine  whether  or not a caller is trying to send
     mail, and pass them on to Fido if not.

     First,  SEAdog must be told to pass non-mail callers on to  Fido.
     This  is  done with a BBS statement in the CONFIG.DOG file,  like
     so:

         bbs RUNBBS *b

     SEAdog will pass a human  caller  to  Fido  by  invoking  another
     generation  of  DOS and giving it whatever command you specify in
     your BBS statement.

     Fido must now be told that it is being passed a user, and that it
     should return control to SEAdog when the user is  finished.  This
     is done by way of the /N and /E switches.  Your RUNBBS.BAT should
     contain a statement something like this:

         fido_ibm %1/n 5/e

     The  "%1/n"  (where  %1  is replaced with a baud rate) tells Fido
     that it already has a user at the specified baud rate.  The "5/e"
     tells Fido that it should terminate with an error level of 5 when
     it is finished with the user.  Fido won't terminate  if  you  use
     "0/e".

     You  will  probably  want  to  add  other  switches  as needed to
     configure your system.  See the Fido manual for more details.

     You should use somewhat different mail events when  operating  on
     FidoNet.  We recommend some variation of the following:

         Event H all 3:00 3:30           ;Locals to hubs
         Event G all 3:30 4:00           ;Hubs to outbound gates
         Event T all 4:00 5:00           ;National Mail Hour
         Event V all 5:00 5:30           ;Inbound gates to hubs
         Event W all 5:30 6:00           ;Hubs to locals

     Check  with  your  network host for the exact times.  If your net
     does not have hubs,  then you can leave out events H  and  V.  If
     you do not have an outbound host, then you can leave out events H
     and G.  If you are in a region,  then we recommend a single event
     A, as with Fido.

     If you have an outbound host,  then you will need to  modify  the
     St.  Louis  node  list.  You  would  do  this by placing an OGATE
     statement in your XLATLIST control file.  For  example,  if  your
     Fidonews                     Page 8                   28 Apr 1986


     outbound host is node 107/16,  then your XLATLIST.CTL file should
     contain:

         OGATE 107/16

     You should place XLATLIST and ROUTEGEN in SEAdog mode by removing
     the FIDO statement from their control files.  We advise that  you
     use   SEAdog  implicit  routing  wherever  possible.   Fido-style
     detailed route files can be used, but are not needed.


     You will need to define external events in Fido to correspond  to
     all  of  your SEAdog events.  Otherwise,  Fido won't know when it
     has to force a user off.  For  example,  if  you  are  using  the
     events  given  above,  then  you  should tell Fido that it has an
     external event starting at 0300,  with a 180 minute window.  This
     event  should  exit with the same error level as that of the "/e"
     switch,  since they both mean the same thing (return to  SEAdog).
     We  suggest  that  you  have  SEAdog  handle all of your "normal"
     external events.


     If you wish to use Fido's O)utside or sysop zero  commands,  then
     you'll  need  to  set  your  error  levels  and  your  batch file
     properly.  Here's an example of a RUNBBS.BAT for  Fido  with  the
     sysop zero command:

         echo off
         :loop
         fido_ibm %1/n 5/e 10/w 15/a
              if errorlevel 15 goto outside
              if errorlevel 10 goto dropdos
              goto seadog

         :outside
         watchdog on
         remsysop /c
         watchdog off
         goto loop

         :dropdos
         watchdog on
         ctty com1
         echo Type EXIT to return to Fido.
         command
         ctty con
         watchdog off
         goto loop

         :seadog

     You  can't  just  "run  off  the  end"  for remote system access,
     because DOS will exit and return to SEAdog.  Instead,  you should
     invoke  a  new generation of DOS by giving the "COMMAND" command.
     It will terminate when you type "EXIT",  and you will  loop  back
     into  Fido.  The meaning of "%1" will be retained,  and Fido will

     start up at the proper baud rate.

     If you do NOT need any DOS access from Fido,  then you don't need
     a  RUNBBS.BAT  file at all.  Instead,  you can have SEAdog invoke
     Fido directly.  The BBS statement in your CONFIG.DOG  file  would
     then look something like this:

         BBS fido_ibm %1/n 5/e


     SEAdog's  default banner states that it is a private mail system,
     and asks the caller to hang up.  You will want  to  change  this.
     You  can  use  either  or  both of two methods.  The first is the
     BANNER statement in your  configuration  file.  Whatever  follows
     the word "BANNER",  up to the end of the line or a semicolon,  is
     displayed instead of the default banner.  A typical example might
     be:

         BANNER SEAboard system -- stand by for Fido

     You can also create a text file named BANNER.DOG,  which will  be
     displayed  instead of the banner string to any callers outside of
     mail events.  This file may contain anything you like, and may be
     as long as you like, but we recommend that you keep it short,  as
     SEAdog banners cannot be interrupted.


     If  Fido gets "stuck",  which can easily happen if a caller hangs
     up before Fido finishes loading,  then  don't  worry.  Fido  will
     return  to  SEAdog  properly after the next caller or at the next
     event.  You will not, however, be able to receive mail while Fido
     is in control.

                              WHY OWN A MODEM?
                               by Mike Guffey

          In the words of Stewart Brand, publisher of "The Whole Earth
     Software Review" ("TWESR"),  'computers are  automobiles  of  the
     mind.  They empower.  They can also estrange, but information has
     a greater capability for self-correction than gasoline and steel.
     (Also a greater capability for acceleration.)' If what he says is
     true, then consider a modem a combination set of 'booster cables'
     and  a  'siphon hose'.  A device to extract information that will
     give both you and your machine an extra  boost,  a  quick  start,
     more range and versatility.

          A  start to WHERE,  you might ask?  If you don't own a modem
     (and don't plan to acquire one soon) you may feel you are well on
     your way into the computer age.  Thousands of  dollars  worth  of
     technology at your fingertips must mean you're heading SOMEPLACE.
     Right? -- Wrong.

          You've  packed  the  trunk  and are ready to do a minimum of
     cruising around the block.  And you're ready to  drive  back  and
     forth  to work.  But you are as limited as some pedestrians.  You
     can't take a long trip.  You have neither enough 'juice' in  your
     battery nor enough fuel in your tank.  For that you need a modem.
     It  doesn't  matter  how big your engine is or how many bells and
     whistles are under the hood.  Sooner or later you are going  want
     or need to go places your model won't take you.

          One solution is to replace your hardware.  Or your software.
     Or something.  Whatever it is, it is likely to be expensive.  And
     you  will  again be at the mercy of salespeople who mean well but
     just can't understand your needs as you do.  (That's neither  bad
     nor good, it just IS.)

          Enter  the  modem.  Prices  start  at around $100 and go up,
     depending  on  your  needs.   Public  domain  CP/M  software   is
     available  for  most  machines  and for most needs.  The price of
     full-featured commercial communications software is  accelerating
     downward.

          (Just  WHAT  do  you  need  in  a  modem?  Try "The Complete
     Handbook  of  Personal   Computer   Communications"   by   Alfred
     Glossbrenner.   Remember,   this  article  is  about  'WHY',  not
     'what'.)

          In an article on telecommunicating in the premier  issue  of
     "TWESR", Art Kleiner points out four good reasons to own a modem.
     First,  information  retrieval.  The  availability  of  facts and
     figures from the proliferation of databases is, simply,  amazing.
     Second,  is  software access.  By connecting either to the 'free'
     computer Bulletin Board Systems (BBS's) and Remote  CP/M  systems
     (RCP/M'S)  around  your  town  and  around  the world you can get
     Fidonews                     Page 11                  28 Apr 1986


     software to make CP/M much,  much more user friendly.  The  cost?
     The  price  of the phone call.  And by connecting with commercial
     firms you can purchase and acquire software 'online' that may  be
     just  what  you  needed.  Third,  are the electronic transactions
     that  are  'just  around  the  corner'.  Electronic  banking  and
     shopping,  both  local  and  long  distance -- all from your easy
     chair.  And the final reason is communicating with  'like-minded'
     people.  There  is  no other method to quickly access information
     about computing,  about software problems,  about  most  computer
     subjects on a 24-hour, seven-day-per-week basis than by accessing
     BBS's, RCPM's or databases such as "The SOURCE" and "COMPUSERVE".

          To quote Art Kleiner,  "For anyone who's comfortable writing
     and reading, computer [telecommunicating] is a warm... satisfying
     form of communication different from  but  complimentary  to  the
     telephone."

          So,  why own a modem?  Better,  perhaps, to ask, why NOT own
     one?

     This is the first in what we hope will NOT be a regular column of
     FidoNews.  We hope that Fido will be rid of all its  "fleas"  but
     the  column  will  help to point out problems that Fido does have
     and any solutions or comments from Tom Jennings.

     The Bug Nodes have been averaging about 10 messages a week.  Most
     of these messages are not truly bugs,  but rather sysop error  or
     configuration   error.   We  will  attempt  to  talk  about  only
     documented bugs here.

     The only documented bug this week came from 107/210.  He  reports
     that  there  is  a  discrepancy between the summary at the end of
     each mail session and the  actual  log  itself.  The  discrepancy
     seems  to  be  in  the file attach area - did a file actually get
     transferred, or not.


     Here is Tom Jennings response:

     This file attach business:  that is a genuine bug.  The log isn't
     real consistent, ie. did the attaches go or not. You are right in
     that  the  running log is more accurate,  the table at the end is
     not. Or is it the other way around! File attaches are "optional",
     ie.  if an attach fails the transfer is considered OK as long  as
     the mail went.  This is for many reasons, the biggest one is that
     if the receivers disk fills up and the caller will keep trying to
     send over and over,  the protocol doesn't tell different kinds of
     failures,  just go or  no-go.  And,  a  long  time  ago,  it  was
     considered  a  "needless  frill",  hence  it was not designed in.
     Hindsight is wonderful ...  I wouldn't do it the same way  today,
     that's for sure!

        I will see about fixing the log biz in the future.



     That's it for this week.

                             Notes from Abroad


     Hello,  here it is again,  regular as French Nuclear tests in the
     Pacific,  the  one and only European FidoNewsLetter!!  It's about
     4:00 AM here in Woking at the  moment  and  I'm  still  beavering
     (translation:  English  slang  for  working)  away,  halted  only
     occasionally by the keyboard locking up as FidoNet (in foreground
     partition of MultiLink) dials up Henk Wevers  in  an  attempt  to
     send  some  important bit of FidoGossip.  I don't think we should
     call it FidoMail yet; but it's getting there.

     I hope you see the  point  I'm  trying  to  make.  The  last  few
     newsletters have been dominated by my pleas for FidoNet activity.
     It  seems  that  my  pleas  have not fallen on deaf ears.  Almost
     every night now I either send or receive mail,  on a good night -
     both.  I  have  a  free offer on for FidoMail at the moment on my
     node (4403,4404) in an attempt to get more people using the  net.
     Most  people  on  my board hardly even bother to look at the mail
     section.  Fido is just a big free software library as far as they
     are concerned.  Am I the only one who has this problem?

     We have just changed over to Daylight Saving (to use the American
     term).  In English I think that means  the  end  of  summer  time
     (summer  I  hear you say - I only hope yours was better than ours
     in the UK).

     Our two London Fido's (Dataflex and Microway) are still  off  air
     at  the  moment.  Their sysops (Bob Manekshaw and Nik Spicer) are
     both keeping in touch  and  say  that  only  minor  problems  are
     holding  them  up.  Jim Richardson (4405) has been off-line for a
     while and as of now he is still not yet back on  line.  Jim  says
     has  had  a few hardware problems and also a slipped disk (in his
     back!).  Get well soon Jim.

     Rod Smallwood has returned  to  the  Fido  scene  after  a  short
     illness.  I'm sure Rod would like me to say "Hello",  so there it
     is.  If you do wish to contact Rod a mail  message  addressed  to
     him on 4403 would be the best way.

     We  still  have  modem  problems  but  I think the 300 baud modem
     problem has been cracked by the Dataflex modem.  It still  has  a
     couple  of  bugs but on the whole I'm pleased by the performance.
     For your interest the main bug is that it doesn't  recognize  the
     dial  tone  properly.  If  someone calls in and hangs up half way
     through the connect  sequence,  the  modem  hangs  and  tries  to
     connect thinking the dial tone is a 2400 baud incoming call.  Bob
     Manekshaw says he has a fix in the pipeline.  He says the cure is
     to  monitor  the  dial  tone  current as opposed to the dial tone
     itself.  As yet he doesn't know whether the fix is going to be in
     software or hardware yet.  When I have more news on this I'll let
     you know.

     cataloguing, archiving and maintaining the files.  Obtaining this
     software  yourself  through  the  use  of a computer with a modem
     using commercial phone access would cost you much more than  what
     we charge for the service...

     prepared on.  The following choices are available:

             IBM PC-DOS Backup utility

             Plain  ol' files (add $50,  though,  it's a lot  of
             work and takes more diskettes...)

     Add  $30  if  you  want  the  library  on  1.2 meg AT disks (more
     expensive disks).  There are no  shipping  or  handling  charges.
     California residents add 6% tax.

                     NIGHT FLIGHT PROPOSES NEW NET


     The Night Flight, Fido 14/609, of Wichita,  Kansas is looking for
     other nodes with an interest in aviation.  No,  you don't have to
     be a pilot to  get  in  on  this.  Night  Flight's  current  main
     emphasis  is in the airline area,  but there must be other boards
     that are interested in any area of aviation.  Those nodes with an
     interest in developing an aviation based net treating areas  such
     as,   General  Aviation,  Corporate,  Homebuilt  or  Airline  are
     requested to drop a note to 14/609.  Please include your  primary
     field  of interest.  The previously mentioned areas should not be
     considered exclusive.

     Night Flight will be  happy  to  act  as  a  clearing  house  for
     suggested  net parameters and operations.  With the increased use
     of microcomputers in the entire field of aviation,  there must be
     a  number  of  users  with  an  interest in such a net out there.
     Let's hear from you airplane nuts!!
