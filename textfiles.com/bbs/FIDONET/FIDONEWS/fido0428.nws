                            Is Echomail Doomed?


     For some time now,  and even more so lately,  we've been watching
     the consequences of our regrettable lack of security.  FidoNet is
     reasonably secure about sending mail to the right people (if  you
     don't look too closely at mail pickups),  but it's wide open when
     it comes to receiving mail.  In normal network  mail  this  isn't
     all  that much of a problem,  but with echomail we find ourselves
     holding a kettle of fish of quite a different color.  I have seen
     two major conferences whither and almost die under what amount to
     terrorist attacks.

     Can we defend ourselves?  Security  measures  can  be  developed,
     surely,  but  will  they do the trick?  I suspect not,  for a few
     reasons.

      1) Most of the measures proposed  are  for  securing  predefined
         conference links, which leaves normal network mail wide open.

      2) For  good  reason.  Securing normal netmail is not practical.
         How can you prearrange security  measures  with  a  new  node
         across the country that you didn't even know existed?

      3) Even  if we secured all links between all systems everywhere,
         that still  won't  stop  people  from  willingly  linking  in
         a known terrorist.

      4) Besides, anyone could fabricate messages for propagation over
         a secure line that appear to originate anywhere at all.

     It starts to look pretty  hopeless.  Is  echomail  doomed?  Well,
     not quite.  When one looks at which conferences were attacked, it
     becomes   apparent   that  it  is  only  the  large  national  or
     international conferences that  really  present  a  good  target.
     Terrorists thrive on attention and  response,  which  they  don't
     really  get in the smaller conferences.  Not to mention that in a
     smaller conference it is correspondingly easier to identify where
     the terrorist is linking in.

     Echomail will thrive.  People  will  continue  to  establish  new
     conferences  for  every topic under the sun.  Echomail is far too
     important a part of our subculture to die out now.  But I suspect
     that the heydey of the  large  international  conference  may  be
     drawing to a close.

     From 107/246

                  The Maxum Turbo XE - A Serious Computer

     The following is an in-depth review of  a  fine  clone  that  you
     should  consider  in  your shopping list if you are looking for a
     new computer in the near future.

         Data Sheet For MAXUM TURBO XE Personal Computer
         -----------------------------------------------

         MAXUM TURBO XE COMPUTER
         Sold by 47th Street Photo.

         The basic unit comes configured as follows:

         Maxum Turbo XE system unit.
         Phoenix type fast Ram test BIOS.
         AT style keyboard with indicator lights built in.
         256k Ram (256k Chips)-(Expandable to 1024k).
         One full height 5 1/2 inch 360k floppy drive.
         One disk controller for up to 2 floppy drives.
         Built in game port.
         8 Expansion Slots (2 Half - 6 Full Size Slots)
         FCC approved slide type case.
         Approved as Class B computing device.
         180 Watt Power Supply.
         MS-DOS 3.2 And GW-BASIC are included.
         Dual speed (4.77/8 Mhz 8088-2) processor.
         Socket for 8087 co-processor chip.
         Built in (battery powered) clock/calendar card.  Keyboard
         (key operated) lock-out switch.
         Power, Turbo, Hard Disk indicator lights.
         Built in reset switch in rear of machine.
         Internal speaker in front of system unit.
         4 power plugs coming out of power supply.

     Price as configured above is $499.00 plus tax.

     The unit comes securely packed in a double carton and  each  unit
     is tested before being released for sale.

     There  is  a  sticker  attached  to  the rear of each unit with a
     number to call for service and/or  advice  (not  toll  free)  you
     might need.  We called twice and each time the phone was answered
     by a polite technician  who  had  a  thorough  knowledge  of  the
     computer  and  was a great help in setting up the computer.  Each
     unit comes with a 5  book  set  of  documentation  complete  with
     excellent  instructions for the novice as well as the experienced
     user.

     I would judge that anyone could have this unit unpacked and fully
     FidoNews 4-28                Page 3                   27 Jul 1987


     operational inside of 25 minutes from opening the carton for  the
     first time.

     The documentation is from Microsoft for the most part and is well
     written  and  should  be a great help in setting up the system as
     well as utilizing the Ram from 640k to 1024k should you decide to
     install the extra Ram yourself at the time of purchase  or  at  a
     later date.

     The  system  as  tested  had  some extra features that were user-
     installed at the time of purchase. They were:

         Full 1024k Ram on the motherboard.
         IBM type RGB color card from Maxum.
         RS-232 card from Honeywell.
         One extra 5 1/2 inch floppy drive.
         One 22 Megabyte Miniscribe hard drive.
         Orchid Turbo 286E Card with 2 Megabytes Of Ram.
         Copy II Pc copy board.

     Approximate cost of system as tested is: $ 2399.00

     The system  runs  all  the  usual  PC  software  such  as  Lotus,
     Wordstar,  Flight Simulator,  dBase III+,  as well as Fido, Opus,
     SEAdog, Telix, PC-TALK, Qmodem and Crosstalk XVI.

     Lattice C,  Turbo Basic,  Quick Basic,  Microsoft Cobol,  and the
     Microsoft  Assembler  were  all  tested  and ran with no problems
     whatsoever.

     The system appears to be 100% compatible,  as we have  not  found
     any  software  that  will not run on this system at the time this
     article was written.

     Below  you will find some data we compiled from the various tests
     we ran on the system. There are 3 results reported for each test.

      1) Normal speed mode is the mode in which the computer  boots  up
         and  according  to  Norton's Sysinfo is slightly faster than a
         normal PC.

      2) Turbo speed is the user selectable speed  increase  gained  by
         typing  the  Cntrl-Alt-2 combination of keys.  This IS NOT the
         Orchid turbo speed which follows.

      3) 286 Turbo speed is when the Orchid 286E card is activated  and
         running.  In  this  mode  you  are  running  for all intensive
         purposes an IBM AT clone at 8 Mhz with  an  Intel  80286  chip
         handling  the processing.  Please note that in this mode it is
         possible to access 704k for DOS to run in,  as  opposed  to  a
         maximum 640k for the other two modes we tested.

     [Editor's note:  Sorry for  the  unusually  long  delay  on  this
     article.  It came to us via a very circuitous route.]


                           *** DOMESTIC NEWS ***

     FIDO/COLLIE SYSOPS' MEETING

     The  November  Fido/Collie  Sysops'  meeting  was   attended   by
     Tatsuyuki Arai,  Yoshi Mikami,  Maki Ohtoh and Junsei Yamada.  It
     was held on 11/14/86 at 7:00,  at Renoir coffee shop  (phone  03-
     493-1454)  near  the  east exit of Osaki Station in Tokyo.  Arai,
     Jun Moriya, John Takiguchi and Yamada had started this meeting on
     every second Friday of the month  from  last  August  to  discuss
     common FidoNet issues and concerns.  For Mikami and Ohtoh, it was
     the first time to meet these people.

     We  jointly  decided  that we will write to International FidoNet
     Association,  St.  Louis,  Missouri,  to get the  FidoNet  region
     number  for  Japan.  We  do  not  want  a host node under Pacific
     Region  12,  out  of  Honolulu,  Hawaii,  as  other  Asia-Pacific
     countries  such  as  Australia  and  New  Zealand  are operating.
     Mikami will write the letter.

     Arai wants to use the POLL and PICKUP functions on  the  receive-
     only  FIDO  node in Tokyo from his FIDO at home.  Those functions
     do not work properly for him.  Tom Jenning's  8/85  documentation
     that  he  has  does  not  explain in sufficient detail how to use
     these functions.  We will get assistance from Fido  operators  in
     U.S.

     We  know that there is a Usenet gateway,  run by Bob Hartman,  on
     FidoNet 101/101,  according to the 8/86 Fido documentation.  Does
     anyone know how to contact a Usenet node in Japan?

     Before switching to Fido, Arai ran Collie in October to find that
     Collie  handles the Japanese Kanji characters nicely.  (Ohtoh and
     Mikami have some Japanese messages in  their  systems.)  However,
     Collie  has  a minor problem in handling Japanese characters,  in
     the sense  that  some  Japanese  characters  are  interpreted  as
     Collie's  control characters.  We will write to D.  Plunkett when
     Jun Moriya returns from his trip to Australia to get the author's
     help (because he knows the technical details).

     Arai wanted to confirm,  and all the  meeting  attendees  agreed,
     that  FidoNet  in  Japan  will be operated on a non-profit basis,
     without discrimination of any kind.

     The  name  of  FidoNet  Japan  was  authorized  to  be  used   on
     Takiguchi's Fido BBS by Tom Jennings earlier this year, according
     FidoNews 4-28                Page 7                   27 Jul 1987


     to  Arai.   (The  Newsletter  Editor  doubt  that  this  has  any
     significance,  but it is documented here as this was discussed at
     the meeting.)

     Any  would-be  Fido/Collie  sysops  are  welcome  to  attend this
     monthly meeting.  The next meeting is on December 12, at the same
     time,  at the same place.  If English assistance is needed,  help
     will be provided.


     COLLIE NET TEST IN KANSAI AREA

     After some pioneering work in April and May 1986, the Fido/Collie
     activities  picked up in the Kansai area recently.  Geki Hagiwara
     provided the following experience report:

         *         *         *         *         *         *         *

         A BBS network FidoNet was formed and tested in Kansai area in
         Sep/Oct 1986.  Actually the software  was  Collie  (Colossus)
         which simulates FidoNet packet transfer protocol.  One of the
         reasons we chose Collie, not Fido, was that Collie resets the
         modem  every  time  the session is over.  It is believed that
         some  modems  cannot  detect  1200/300  and   CCITT/BELL   in
         particular  sequences.  In  such case resetting the modem may
         be effective.  Through our experience Hi-Modem  1200C  looked
         working satisfactorily.

         The members of TMCNET and their equipments are:

         NET NODE  Name          Area  Phone         H/W
         --- ----  ------------- ----- ------------  --------
         001  001  Joe Takemura  Osaka 06-674-1933   JX-5+HDD
              002  K.  Sawaguchi Osaka 06-XXX-XXXX   JX-4
         002  001  Geki Hagiwara Yasu  0775-86-0919  JX-4+HDD
              002  Ken Iwamoto   Kyoto 075-XXX-XXXX  JX-5
              003  Junji Tanaka  Shiga 0778-XX-XXXX  JX-5

         First, each node operator entered messages to several members
         and  the other sysops;  then we set Net mail time and watched
         how Collie sends and receives packets.  We had a hard time to
         find the best combination of  modem  initialization  commands
         and DIP switch setting. (We were helped by Maki Ohtoh.)

         We used the following MODMINIT.BBS file:

                 ATX1
                 ATH1
                 (one blank line - wait 2 seconds)
                 ATS0=1
                 ATV0
                 ATH0

         The Collie startup command was:

                 A>COLLIE /2 /M2 /I1200 /C32
                          |   |   |      |____ Carrier mask bit
                          |   |   |____ Modem init. baud rate
                          |   |____ Modem type
                          |____ COM2 port

         The modem DIP switch setting was:

                 SW1 DTR          OFF
                 SW2 Result       no effective
                 SW3 Return       ON (should have no effect)
                 SW4 Echo         no effective
                 SW5 Answer       no effective
                 SW6 CD           OFF
                 SW7 Tel.line     OFF (depends on phone line)
                 SW8 Command      ON

         Although the modem operation was unstable like trying to call
         while  the  modem  is off hook,  the test resulted in a great
         success.  We just tested the network formed  by  JX  systems,
         but  this  network would not be open to public until the mail
         charge system is established.

     FIDO/COLLIE SYSTEMS IN OPERATION

     To our knowledge,  the following five Fido/Collie BBS systems are
     currently operating on regular basis:

         017-653-5181 ext. 226-7408, Loki BBS (Fido), by Jon
            Spelbring, 24 hours, 1200/300 (CCITT & Bell)
         045-761-9406, SurfSide Net (Fido), by Tatsuyuki Arai,
            24 hours, 2400/1200/300 bps (CCITT & Bell)
         045-894-7656, Collie Yokohama, by Maki Ohtoh,
            24 hours, 1200/300 bps (CCITT & Bell)
         0466-27-2077, Big Blue BBS (Collie), by Yoshi Mikami,
            10:00-11:30 PM Japan Std Time, 1200/300 (C&B)
         082-842-6401, Strawberry Doughnut Net (Collie), by
            Hitoshi Sugimoto, 10:30-11:55 PM JST, 200/300 (C&B)

     Fido Japan 03-432-0185 by John Takiguchi is temporarily closed.

     Mikami, Ohtoh and Sugimoto have been exchanging net messages very
     successfully at 10:45-11:00 PM time slot,  since  early  October,
     between Fujisawa/Yokohama and Hiroshima, a distance of 500 miles.
     After  much  experiment,  Infotech's  Hi-Modem  1200C  among  the
     several JATE-approved  Hayes-compatible  (AT-command  compatible)
     modems   was   found   to  handle  the  Fido/Collie  net  message
     transmission.  They would like to hear other people's experiences
     FidoNews 4-28                Page 9                   27 Jul 1987


     on other modems, because there definitely is a need here for good
     modem competition.

     Ken Sugimoto has translated most of the Collie  .MNU  files  into
     Japanese for easier operator interface,  and has been operating a
     Collie node since October,  somewhere near  the  Fish  Market  in
     Tsukiji, Tokyo.  We'll get his phone number shortly.

     We  do  not claim to know everything happening in Japan regarding
     Fido or Collie.  Please contact anyone of us to let  others  know
     what's going on.


     LETTER TO REQUEST JAPANESE REGION NUMBER SENT

     A  letter  was  sent  11/16/86 by Mikami to International FidoNet
     Association requesting a region number for Japan,  with copies to
     Tom  Jennings  (author  of  Fido  BBS  software) and Dan Plunkett
     (author of Colossus  BBS  sofware).  A  fifty  dollar  check  was
     enclosed  as  our  donation.  Copies  were  also  sent  to people
     mentioned in Item 1.a. above.


                         *** INTERNATIONAL NEWS ***


     MESSAGE EXCHANGE WITH HONG KONG

     Katsu Shintani called FIDO BBS in Hong Kong  00852-5-893-7856  in
     October.  This  is  the  nearest Fido/Collie BBS overseas that we
     know of.  In return,  Fido Japan and Collie Yokohama  received  a
     few messages from Hong Kong.


     ASSISTANCE TO OTHER ASIAN COUNTRIES

     There  are  several  FidoNet  systems  running  in  Australia and
     Indonesia according to  the  3/86  nodelist.  We  would  like  to
     identify  other Fido systems that may be operating in this region
     of the world.  We also offer assistance if help is needed to  set
     up Fido or Collie BBS in the Asia-Pacific countries.

     For  those  who  may  not  know,  Colossus  ("Collie")  is  Fido-
     compatible software that is beginning to be used this year.

                        A Cross-System File Listing
                           (YOU can easily join!)


          I was in one of my more creative moods the other  day;  I've
     finally  written a system that I've wanted to for quite some time
     now:  MegaList.  The "MegaList" is an alphabetized  file  listing
     that combines the files from ALL PARTICIPATING Fido/Opus systems.
     If  you've ever needed a file,  but didn't know where to find it,
     the MegaList is a good place to look;  scan down the list for the
     file  you  need,  and listed next to it are the BBSs that have it
     online.

          The MegaList  is  available  for  download  or  SEAdog  file
     request from 135/68.  The following files are online now:

          MEGALIST.ARC/TXT    The National (unfiltered) MegaList
          MEGA-ARC.ARC/TXT    The National ARChive MegaList
          MEGA-TXT.ARC/TXT    The National TXT/DOC MegaList
          ML-UPD.ARC          MegaList Update Software

          YOUR  system  can  be  added to the NATIONAL MegaList if you
     simply run the update program,  ML-UPD.  This program will create
     an  update  file  based  on YOUR system information and FILES.BBS
     contents.  This data is then ARCed and Net-mailed to  135/68  for
     central collection.  The NATIONAL MegaList is updated each day at
     6:15AM and posted for download or file request.

          Placing your system in the MegaList will let the rest of the
     world  know what's on your system without everyone having to call
     and look.  The ML-UPD program is easy and only  takes  about  1-2
     minutes  to  run.  All  you  must do is send a MegaList update to
     Miami at least once every 45 days,  and you will be in the  daily
     MegaList update.

          As  of this writing,  I haven't released ML-COL,  the "host"
     processing/collection program.  I will be releasing  this  system
     in  its  entirety before the end of August.  If you're interested
     in creating a LOCAL MegaList for YOUR area, please contact me for
     the list creation software.

        AUTHENTIC SECURE SECRET FIDO MAIL WITH PUBLIC KEY ENCRYPTION

     INTRODUCTION
     ============
     This article was written by  Prodex  Labs,  for  examination  and
     comment  by  IFNA  (International  Fidonet  Association)  Sysops,
     members, Fidonet users,  and others interested in electronic mail
     and  security.  Prodex  Labs  (Lee  Rothstein,  Phil Zimmermann &
     Steve Welch)  is  very  much  interested  in  your  comments  and
     suggestions.

     PRODEX LABS, PUBLIC KEY ENCRYPTION & FIDO
     -----------------------------------------
     We  are now about ready to deliver C-based modules that can carry
     out public key encryption.

     We are writing this article because of the extreme  relevance  we
     see  of  public  key  cryptography to electronic mail.  We assume
     electronic mail is near and dear to your hearts, and we think you
     might be interested in the application of public  key  encryption
     to  Fidomail  and Fidonet transfers.  The discussion,  we provide
     here,  on public key cryptography aims specifically at electronic
     mail applications.

     Public   key   encryption   technology   allows   the  convenient
     distribution of messages through an electronic mail system secure
     against other  users,  sysops  ("superusers")  and  even  systems
     programmers.  It  allows  this security in the face of inherently
     insecure networks and hosts.  This we think is  a  feature  whose
     time has come.  We think it lends itself well to the expansion of
     Fidonet  services,  as well as the opportunity for Fido sysops to
     unobtrusively draw revenue  from  a  subset  of  Fido  services--
     specifically  those  that  have to do with private and commercial
     mail.

     Specifically,  we suspect the lack of privacy of  messages  (from
     Sysops  and  technotwits)  has  discouraged  the use of Fido as a
     national distribution medium  for  personal  mail,  and  business
     mail.  Second,  the  lack  of  an  authentication  mechanism  has
     discouraged  commercial  concerns  from  using  Fidomail   as   a
     distribution  mechanism  for  authentic  marketing  programs  and
     documents such as ads,  coupons and purchase  orders.  By  adding
     these commercial services to Fido,  the revenue produced could be
     used to subsidize  other  Fido  services  such  as  mass  storage
     (downloads) and Techline distribution (long distance charges).

     The authentication capability mentioned in the previous paragraph
     might   also   be  of  use  directly  to  Fidonet  as  it  grows.
     Authentication would allow nodes that are operating  in  a  store
     and  forward  sub-net  to prove their legitimacy prior to a relay
     operation.  Since we are not familiar with the daily  operational
     problems of Hosts,  we do not know if we have proposed a solution
     to a non-existent problem.

     Finally,  we think that the recent introduction of "Dutchie"  may
     be  one of the key ingredients to the success of the introduction
     FidoNews 4-28                Page 12                  27 Jul 1987


     and use of public key encryption in Fidonet.  For  those  of  you
     not  yet familiar with it,  Dutchie is the private delivery point
     implementation for Fidonet by Henk Wevers.

     SINGLE KEY ENCRYPTION: WHY PUBLIC KEY ENCRYPTION IS REQUIRED!
     --------------------------------------------------------------
     Public key encryption technology differs from the more well-known
     single key technology in that each person has two keys associated
     with  him/her--a  public  key,  and  a  private  key.  (DES--Data
     Encryption Standard--is the most well-known example of single key
     encryption.)

     In public key encryption, the public key is known by everyone and
     either  can  be looked up by the user from a table of keys versus
     user  names  or  automatically  looked  up  by  the  applications
     software (e.g., electronic mail software).

     In single key encryption,  Fred encrypts file 'nerd.msg' with the
     key "secret_potion".  When Bill wants to  decrypt  the  file,  he
     must  have  been  told by Fred what the key for decrypting (i.e.,
     encrypting) 'nerd.msg' is.  Specifically,  Bill must  supply  the
     key "secret_potion" to decrypt 'nerd.msg'.  If "secret_potion" is
     always associated with Fred's files,  then Bill knows the key for
     those files that Fred does not want him to see.  More succinctly,
     the decryption and encryption  functions  are  inverses  of  each
     other.  Symbolically:

         (1)  encrypted_file <- sk_encrypt(file, key)
         (2)  file <- sk_encrypt(encrypted_file, key) i.e., decryption
                                                      is encryption
                                                      and the key is
                                                      the same going
                                                      in both
                                                      directions

          The  above  notation assumes that objects with the same name
          and only objects with the same name are identical.

     Let's look at  the  consequences  of  the  logic  of  single  key
     encryption  within  an electronic mail system.  Anyone that wants
     to send secret messages to someone  else  must  either  know  the
     recipient's  one  and  only  secret key,  or relinquish their own
     secret key,  or maintain a list of secret keys  by  recipient  or
     file; not a very attractive alternative.

     What's  worse,  if  the  key  information  is  exchanged by users
     through the mail system,  then the sysop has a crack at the  key.
     This  seems  very likely when you consider that you probably want
     the mail system itself to  automatically  monitor,  maintain  and
     administer the keys because of the previously described problems.

     PUBLIC KEY ENCRYPTION
     =====================

     PUBLIC KEY ENCRYPTION EXPLAINED
     -------------------------------
     FidoNews 4-28                Page 13                  27 Jul 1987


     These  and  other problems can be made to disappear with a public
     key encryption  system.  The  public  and  private  keys  make  a
     matched, idiosyncratic set.  A file encrypted with the public key
     can  only  be  decrypted by the private key.  A file encrypted by
     the private key can only be decrypted by the  public  key.  These
     properties  can be used to significant advantage in an electronic
     mail system.  The obvious advantage of the public key  technology
     over  the  more normal single private key technology such as DES,
     is that a user does not have to give away his/her private key.

     Secrecy
     -------
     If you want secrecy in a message that you send  us,  you  encrypt
     the  message  with our public key and then we decrypt it with our
     private key.

     Signature Function
     ------------------
     If you want to authenticate a message as really coming from  you,
     you  encrypt it with your private key and then we decrypt it with
     your public key.  If your public key does not  make  the  message
     intelligible  then  it wasn't encrypted with your private key and
     therefore it didn't come from you--the one and  only  person  who
     has access to your private key.

     Secrecy & Authentication
     ------------------------
     The  secrecy and authentication encryptions outlined above can be
     combined sequentially to provide a complete framework of security
     for electronic mail.

     Symbolically, we could describe these properties as:

     If A were sending a message to B:

          (1)  encrypted_file <- pk_encrypt(file, public_key_B)
          (2)  file           <- pk_decrypt(encrypted_file,
               private_key_B)

               (1)  Would be used by the sender to achieve privacy.
               (2)  Would be used by the receiver to achieve
                    "legibility."

               AND

          (3)  encrypted_file <- pk_encrypt(file, private_key_A)
          (4)  file           <- pk_decrypt(encrypted_file,
               public_key_A)

               (3)  Would be used by the sender to achieve
                    authentication.
               (4)  Would be used by the receiver to prove
                    authentication and achieve "legibility."

     If we wished privacy and authentication in a message from A to B:

          (5)  double_encrypted_file <-
                    pk_encrypt(pk_encrypt(file, public_key_B),
                    private_key_A)
          (6)  file <- pk_decrypt(pk_decrypt(double_encrypted_file,
                    private_key_B), public_key_A)

               (5)  Would be used by the sender to achieve privacy and
                    authentication.
               (6)  Would be used by the receiver to achieve
                    "legibility", and prove authentication.

          In the above notation we again assume that objects with  the
          same   name   and  only  objects  with  the  same  name  are
          equivalent.

     OTHER REQUIREMENTS & PROPERTIES
     -------------------------------
     Several  other  properties  of  public  key  encryption   require
     explanation  to  fully  understand how security can be maintained
     and how a mail system can work.

     First,  the program that generates the key pairs  can  be  widely
     distributed  so  that  it  can be used by each user privately and
     securely.

     Second,  the algorithm that generates the  public  key  from  the
     private key is not reversible either by the generating program or
     by any other program a hacker would write.

     Third,  the kinds of keys generated and required by the encrypt /
     decrypt function(s) are on the order of  a  1000  bits.  This  is
     what  makes  trial  and  error  computation  of  the  private key
     extremely unlikely to the point of impossibility,  and also  what
     makes users generating like public keys unlikely.

     Fourth, the electronic mail nodes (for Fidonet, Fido nodes) would
     have  to  provide  a  key  server  function.   Once  a  user  had
     calculated his public key from a private key  he  would  have  to
     submit  it  to  a  node  to  be paired with his/her user ID.  The
     server function would also have  to  supply  the  public  key  to
     private  mail  sent  to the corresponding user ID.  Another major
     function of the key server is an automatic certification  process
     that  is  beyond  the  scope  of  a first release product or this
     paper.

     Finally,  for performance sake,  any reasonable implementation of
     public  key  cryptography  would transparently (unknown to users)
     invoke an internal method of single key encryption.  However, all
     user and crackers would ever (or could ever) see  is  the  public
     key mechanisms.

     IMPLEMENTING PUBLIC KEY ENCRYPTION WITHIN THE FIDO ENVIRONMENT
     ==============================================================

     THE IMPOSSIBLE DREAM
     --------------------
     FidoNews 4-28                Page 15                  27 Jul 1987


     If  we  were  to  directly  implement  an  automatic,  public key
     cryptography security system into  Fido  mail  that  would  avoid
     sysops  having  any  possibility of access to the private keys or
     the mail prior to encryption,  we would have  to  accomplish  the
     following:

     (a)  We  would  have  to add a secure mail option to the terminal
          emulation program.  We would  further  have  to  modify  the
          user's  terminal  emulation  program  so  that all mail text
          entered was encrypted before each line was sent by the  user
          to the mail edit/entry function on the BBS.

          There  are  some  outs  here,   but  they  are  pretty  well
          invalidated by several properties of  BBS  software.  First,
          mail  entry  is  designed  to  be an online editing activity
          rather than via upload.  Second,  the mail entry function is
          designed  to  handle pure text and not the binary files that
          result from encryption.  Third,  most  mail  input  software
          strongly  limits  the length and format (e.g.,  line length,
          blank lines,  use of tabs) of input messages.  If  one  uses
          "ASCII  transfer" capability there is a possibility the file
          will fail the length test  or  be  modified  by  the  format
          assumptions,  because  it was not edited with the length and
          format tests operative.  Fourth,  the prompting  feature  of
          the mail editor very often interferes with ASCII upload.

     (b)  We  would  have  to  make  modifications  to  the  BBS  mail
          edit/entry function  so  that  some  text  was  accepted  in
          unencrypted format (i.e., 'To:' and 'From:' information) and
          the remainder was in encrypted format (i.e.,  'Subject:' and
          body of message. ('From:' can be hidden if BBS Sysops do not
          object.)

     (c)  We would have to add a public key server function to the BBS
          that would maintain and  service  public  keys.  This  would
          also have to allow for the distribution of keys from node to
          node.

     (d)  We would have to make sure that encryption did not interfere
          with Fidomail routing line additions to the text body.

     This  theory  will  not  work  or  rather will not work without a
     ground swell of support for private mail.  We cannot get  control
     of  all  of  the  following  simultaneously:  (a)  user  terminal
     emulation software,  (b)  Fido  mail  entry  software,  (c)  Fido
     general  BBS  software,  (d)  Fido  networking  and mail exchange
     software.  How do we create the ground swell, then?

     FIRST STEPS
     -----------

     Step 1
     ------
     We develop two program functions (they may or may not actually be
     separate programs) that can be distributed via  Fido.  Currently,
     we  estimate  we  can  have  these  two  programs done within two
     FidoNews 4-28                Page 16                  27 Jul 1987


     months.

     The first program is a  DOS  (Unix  style)  filter.  It  has  two
     functions.  First,  given  one file that contains the private key
     and a second file that contains the text to  be  encrypted,  this
     first program,  which I will call 'pk_crypt',  provides an output
     file that is encrypted and can be decrypted with the public  key.
     This serves the authentication function.  Second,  'pk_crypt' can
     encrypt a file with public key so that it can be  decrypted  with
     the private key.  This provides the privacy function.

     The second program generates unique key pairs.

     Step 2
     ------
     Sysops  provide a message section and a coordinated file section.
     The message section allows users to notify each other that  there
     are  secure  messages  that  have been uploaded to the respective
     users that have been notified via  standard  Fido  text  message.
     The  file section is not only a safe (reliable,  not secure) port
     for uploaded secure message files but also for a single text file
     that contains a list of the mapping of user IDs to  public  keys.
     Users  upload  their  public  keys  as they generate them and the
     sysops collate these  standard  format  subfiles  into  a  single
     standard format public key-user ID list.

     We  will  provide  documentation  not  only  for  the  use of the
     program,  but also for how users can "certify" new users and  new
     keys,  since  we  will not at this stage be able to provide a key
     server automated certification process.

     Step 3
     ------
     Sysops provide a standard service that allows binary files to  be
     "attached to" Fidomail messages.  Nothing automatic is implied by
     the previous sentence.

     Step 4
     ------
     We would have to provide a mail function that from the same level
     of  menu allowed the entry of a text tag message into the message
     system, followed by the immediate upload of an encrypted (perhaps
     archived) file to the secure message file section.

     The inverse  of  these  two  processes  would  also  have  to  be
     provided.  Users  would  have to be able,  from the same level of
     message  menu,   to  first  read  a  tag  message,   and,   then,
     immediately, download the associated secure binary message file.

     think  about  practically  any  of  this?   We   are   especially
     interested  in  your views and ideas as to how (or if) it can fit
     into Fidonet.  We await your responses.

     Patrick McDonald, 109/657

           Sirius v0.50 - The FOS-Compatible Message Base Manager

     "... and all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by"
                                       --- Masefield

          Sirius,  a star in Canis Major also known as the  dog  star,
     has   been  guiding  mariners  in  the  Northern  hemisphere  for
     centuries. Sirius, the message base manager by Bob Klahn of 150/1
     will now add a new twist to  the  common  definition  by  helping
     solve your message base manipulation and navigation problems.  No
     matter  what  software  you  currently  use to interact with your
     Fido/Opus/SEAdog message base, Sirius has features that will help
     make it the message manager of choice on your system.

     In particular, Sirius 0.50:

     *  Provides universal context-sensitive help via the "?" key.

     *  Adapts its prompting to your  needs  and  level  of  expertise
        while keeping required keystrokes to a minimum.

     *  Supports one hundred message areas.

     *  Recognizes  EchoMail and NetMail areas,  and allows them to be
        addressed by name as well as by number.

     *  Edits new or existing messages with the  configurable  outside
        text  editor  of  your  choice,  or with its own line-oriented
        editor.

     *  Quotes replied-to message text with prefixing that YOU choose,
        and with the option to prefix the quoted author's lines only.

     *  Moves and copies messages to flat files,  to the  printer,  to
        other  message  areas,  low or high,  up or down,  and with or
        without "stamping".

     *  Groups messages logically, in ways YOU define, using a library
        of over three dozen Boolean,  integer,  and string  functions.
        Operations  may be performed on a message group as a unit,  or
        group definitions may be  used  to  filter  the  retrieval  of
        individual messages.

     *  Can  record  your  interactive  keystrokes  in script form for
        later playback.  Yes, Sirius will write your scripts for you!

     *  Allows its complete  functionality  to  be  accessed  locally,
        remotely, or through its automated scripts.

     *  Provides access to DOS from within the Sirius environment.

     The Basics
     ~~~~~~~~~~

     FidoNews 4-28                Page 19                  27 Jul 1987


          The  entire  interactive  interface of Sirius is designed to
     minimize the number of keystrokes entered.  Many of the main menu
     commands have lower submenus,  and commands  may  be  stacked  as
     appropriate,  with  white  space needed only when ambiguity might
     otherwise result.  In addition, the "?" character is available at
     all menus to provide context sensitive help to guide you along.

          As a message base manager,  Sirius provides you with all the
     usual  functions,  and  then some.  You may select a message area
     not only  by  the  usual  method  of  area  number,  but  by  the
     associated  EchoMail  area tag as well.  If you have many message
     areas or are in  the  habit  of  occasionally  reorganizing  your
     message areas,  this feature makes it easier to jump into an echo
     area.  The entire area name need not be specified when  utilizing
     this feature, but only enough to uniquely identify it.

          Messages  may  be  retrieved  in  a number of ways (forward,
     backward,  and by links),  and when retrieving messages it is not
     necessary  to  view the entire text.  You may tell Sirius to only
     view message text until a given text string is encountered  (such
     as 'SEEN-BY: '), and as indicated in the example, this is usually
     used to squelch the EchoMail routing information.

     Shifting into 2nd Gear
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

          You  can do a lot more with messages than just retrieve them
     and display them to your screen.  Sirius  provides  features  for
     moving  messages  around  to  various  locations.  You  may  copy
     messages to a file (optionally either  appending  or  overwriting
     the file),  to your printer, or to other locations in the message
     system.  These "other locations" encompass copying the message to
     another area as well as different spots  within  the  same  area.
     When moving a message, you may optionally ask Sirius to include a
     "stamp" line in the copied message (much like the Opus forwarding
     information but much more concise).

     The Doctor's Office
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

         So, you want to change something about a message?  The Doctor
     function provides the means of changing virtually every aspect of
     a message IN PLACE,  including message header fields,  body text,
     flags,  and attach filenames.  The Body doctor is also a powerful
     tool all by itself,  providing a full-featured line-oriented text
     editor for the message body.  The line editor makes extensive use
     of PC editing keys while providing control key mapping for remote
     usage and local keyboards that don't have  these  keys.  Selected
     portions of the message body may be re-wrapped at will and to any
     line width that you like.  You may also import text from external
     files.  As  powerful  as  the editing features inherent to Sirius
     are,  you may need to do something to a message body not provided
     by  Sirius,  or  may  simply  have a preference for a full-screen
     editor.  This is no problem since  Sirius  provides  support  for
     editing  message  bodies  with  the  external text editor of your
     choice.
     FidoNews 4-28                Page 20                  27 Jul 1987


     ... And you may quote me on that!
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

          When replying to an  existing  message,  Sirius  provides  a
     quoting  feature that is unsurpassed by any other message system.
     You are not locked into any particular reply prefix,  but  rather
     may  specify  your  own "designer quote" to be used for prefixing
     selected portions of the text of the replied-to  message.  Sirius
     does  not  just  blindly  prefix the entire original message text
     when forming the reply-quoted message (although  it  can  if  you
     desire)  but  actually  has  the  ability  to  prefix  only those
     portions of the original message that ARE NOT  ALREADY  PREFIXED!
     This  becomes especially useful when responding to a message that
     already has text reply-quoted from one or more authors.

     Join the Group
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

          Sirius provides a group definition facility that is  perhaps
     the  single  most  powerful  capability in its arsenal.  Using an
     extensive set of message-oriented  functions  and  an  expression
     formation language similar to many general programming languages,
     you  may  define  up  to  twenty-six different message groups.  A
     group definition may be  used  in  one  of  two  different  ways.
     First,  a  message group may be used as a retrieval filter.  That
     is,  by virtue of a group definition being in force,  the message
     area  appears  to  only  contain  messages  that  match the group
     specification.  This might be used for  something  as  simple  as
     only  considering  messages  addressed  specifically to you,  for
     example.

          The second use of a group definition is in conjunction  with
     group  operations.  Group  operations  mirror,  in some respects,
     those functions available for single messages (such as copying to
     a file,  deleting,  moving elsewhere) but act on the entire group
     of  messages  as  a  unit.  Some  of  these  group operations are
     unavailable in 0.50,  but will be there  in  0.51.  The  built-in
     functions for use in group definitions include the following:

         Boolean (Message Flags):

         @Private       @Xpress     @Received   @Sent
         @FileAttach    @InTransit  @Orphan     @KillSent
         @Local         @Hold       @FileReq    @AuditReq
         @ReceiptReq    @UpdateReq

         Boolean (Other):

         @FromYou       @ToYou      @NoBody     @ReadOnly

         Integer Functions:

         @DaysHere      @DaysOld    @FileSize   @Zenith
         @HighMsg#      @LowMsg#    @Msg#       @MsgCount
         @NetFrom       @NetTo      @NodeFrom   @NodeTo

     FidoNews 4-28                Page 21                  27 Jul 1987


         String Functions (case insensitive):

         @From          @To         @Subject    @Header
         @Body          @Msg        @Keyin

     Sirius provides the usual conditional operators (EQ,  NE, GT, LT,
     GE, LE, AND, OR), as well as some additional ones:

         CO     contains
         NC     does not contain
         IN     is contained in
         NI     is not contained in

     A few simple examples of Sirius expressions will make  clear  the
     power intrinsic in their usage:

     1. @ToYou OR @FromYou

     This expression will match only those messages that are to you or
     from you.

     2. @ToYou AND @Private

     This expressions will match those messages addressed to you which
     are private.

     3. @From CO 'arcmail' AND NOT @Local

     This expression would match your inbound ARCmail attach messages.

     4. @DaysHere GT 7 AND @InTransit

     Suppose  you  are  a hub and want to identify those messages that
     have been sitting waiting for delivery for more than  a  week  (a
     possible indication of trouble)?  This will do it.

     5. @Msg CO 'Heinlein'

     A science fiction fanatic?  This will find those messages related
     to your favorite author.


          As  is  the case elsewhere,  the Sirius expression parser is
     built with the  user  in  mind.  When  entering  a  Sirius  group
     definition,  you  need  only type enough to uniquely identify the
     token, and Sirius will fill in the rest automagically.

     Shifting into High Gear
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

          What has been mentioned before,  but which  might  not  have
     been  truly  appreciated  until  now,  is  the  fact  that Sirius
     provides a scripting language that allows you to do anything from
     a  script  that  can  be  done  online  (including  creating  new
     messages,  replying  to  old ones,  etc...).  The script language
     uses a Lisp-like syntax,  and the verbs match  exactly  the  menu
     FidoNews 4-28                Page 22                  27 Jul 1987


     commands  which  you  use  online,  including a conditional and a
     while loop construct driven by  the  same  types  of  expressions
     listed  above.  Sirius scripts may call other Sirius scripts in a
     nestable fashion,  and I/O commands allow you easily design menus
     and other forms of interaction with the user at the keyboard.  In
     combination  with  DOS  parameterized  batch files,  your Sirius-
     driven system can almost  run  itself  in  some  respects.  As  a
     simple example, consider the following script:

     (View (Xpertise (High))
      View (Continuous)
      Area (NetMail)
      Group (Define (@ToYou AND NOT @Received))
      0 Next
      ! (While (@Msg# LE @HighMsg#))
         Copy (Flat file ('NEWTOME.TXT'))
         Next
         ! (End)
      Quit (Bbs))

          This  simple  script  will append all of the new messages to
     you in your netmail area to the file NEWTOME.TXT in your  current
     directory.  For  the new Sirius user who might want to dive right
     in writing Sirius scripts,  there is a recording option that  you
     may  use  to allow Sirius to write the script for you,  simply by
     recording  in  the  proper  format  operations  that  you   enter
     interactively.

     Winding Down
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~

          Sirius  is  still  a growing project.  Many enhancements are
     planned and  there  is  an  active  national  Sirius  echo  being
     coordinated  by  150/1.  The Sirius author,  Bob Klahn,  is quite
     receptive to user suggestions for Sirius enhancements.  There are
     subtleties and details to Sirius that were  not  appropriate  for
     inclusion  in  this  brief  introduction.  At  the  time  of this
     writing,  there does not exist a single,  comprehensive,  set  of
     documentation for Sirius.  This problem is being addressed by the
     Beta  Test  Group and hopefully will be remedied shortly.  In the
     interim,  there does exist a complete set of  release  notes  for
     Sirius  that  cover  major features,  and these combined with the
     online help and sample  scripts  shipped  with  Sirius  serve  to
     offset  the lack of formal documentation.  The best bet for a new
     Sirius user is simply to dive in and try  it  (and  to  join  the
     Sirius  echo  where  experienced  users will be able to lend some
     help).  Bob's practice in  the  past  has  been  to  release  new
     versions  of  Sirius  on  a  regular  schedule.  Due to the major
     enhancements  in  version  0.50  (most  dealing  with  the  group
     definition  facility),  this  latest version has been almost four
     months in development and testing,  and we are sure you will find
     it worth the wait.

     The Augusta Forum 360/1

                       THE SPORTSNET ECHO CONFERENCE

     The SportsNet Echo Conference was started by the Augusta Forum in
     February of this year to give FidoNet boards  a  chance  to  talk
     coast  to  coast  about  their  favorite  sports  topics.  Almost
     everyone has at least a little interest in sports of one type  or
     another,  either  as a participant or a spectator ...  if you do,
     this conference is for you.

     SportsNet is NOT just a "my team's better than yours" conference!
     It is a place for discussions about  WHY  teams  or  players  are
     better  ...  or  worse.  On  SportsNet you have to be prepared to
     discuss your  choices  for  the  World  Series,  Super  Bowl,  or
     whatever ... someone's bound to differ with you.

     You'll find a place for participants, spectators, and media.  The
     net  has had discussions among bicycling racers ...  and also has
     heard from a TV station director.

     Of course,  the obvious sports  (football,  baseball,  etc.)  are
     discussed  but  there's  also  lively discussion about the lesser
     known ones (we've even gotten into  snake  handling  and  buffalo
     chip throwing)!  What-ever the sport, we'll discuss it.

     SportsNet  can be a learning place,  too.  If you don't know what
     an ERA (base-ball) or a blue line (hockey)  are,  you  can  learn
     those  things  there.  Also,  the  conference has a weekly trivia
     quiz, possibly the first of its kind among echo conferences.

     Football fans will  find  a  place,  this  fall,  to  test  their
     prediction  skills  on  NFL games,  and possibly selected college
     games as well.

     If  you're  not  already  a  part  of  SportsNet,  this  is  your
     invitation to give us a try.  We aren't one of those 100-message-
     a-day  conferences  that  sometimes  can overwhelm a newcomer ...
     we're still small enough for anyone to fit right in.  We do  have
     boards  in  New York,  Baltimore,  Pittsburgh,  Dallas,  Indiana,
     Arkansas,  and Oklahoma,  as well as  most  of  the  Southeastern
     states.  If  you're  interested  in SportsNet,  drop me a NetMail
     message.  We'd like to have you join us!

     grow???

     We want to invite you to become a part of our growing echos.  One
     of  the echos is not limited to broadcasters only.  It is a place
     that the public can talk with the people  in  the  industry.  The
     decision makers. People with the answers.

     If  you'd  like  to  become  a  part of our growing family in the

                                1:157/504.1

          Things are  going very  well this past week. I've found some
     more programs that will run with SIMCGA (Ancient Art of War and a
     few others  by Broderbund). In addition, I'm finally getting used
     to this new keyboard. My old XT had an original  PC style layout,
     but with  10 function keys at the top and a cursor pad as well as
     a numeric keypad. The keyboard with  the AT  is one  of the "new"
     101 key style keyboards, 12 function keys and such. I'm still not
     entirely used  to it,  but things  are a  lot easier  after a few
     weeks of  use (and  some customizing with SuperKey). Just goes to
     show how flexible the human mind can be when it has to adjust.

     -- Ventura Publisher Version 1.1 (Xerox, List $895.00) --

          Some of you may recall  how  much  I  liked  version  1.0 of
     Ventura Publisher  when I  got to  try it  out a few months back.
     Well Xerox has been busy working on an update, and  it improves a
     product I wouldn't have thought could be improved. On the surface
     it still looks (and acts) the same, but  once you  get beyond the
     initial  pull  down  screens  it  has a lot of new (yet familiar)
     functions and improvements. While it costs  $100.00 to  update to
     the  new  version  of  Ventura,  it is money well spent (the list
     price is still the  same,  it  didn't  go  up).  Even  the manual
     appears to be written better than the version 1.0 manual.

          I still  thinks it's amusing that Xerox's DeskTop Publishing
     program supports  PostScript  printers  better  than  Xerox's own
     printers. PostScript  users will  greatly appreciate  some of the
     new features in 1.1. The font  names now  match the  names you're
     used  to  calling  them,  and  Ventura  lists  all  of  the Adobe
     supported fonts. If you have something like the QMS PS800+ (or an
     Allied Linotronic  typesetter), you  won't have to do anything to
     make Ventura know about your additional fonts. Instead of the box
     selections of  fonts and sizes in 1.0, you now see something that
     resembles the box you're used to using to select files (only they
     aren't files,  they're several dozen fonts). You are also free to
     enter the point size of the font, no limitations under PostScript
     (other  than  those  your  printer  has built into it). If you're
     using download fonts to your PostScript device, it's very easy to
     tell Ventura  about them.  Once told,  it will download the fonts
     you're using automatically. While Ventura still doesn't take full
     advantage of  PostScript's powerful capabilities, it brings it up
     a step from the previous version (and while I'm not sure, I think
     it beats PageMaker's PostScript support).

          In  version  1.0  there  were  some  wonderful features when
     bringing in a short text file, or some  form of  art. Ventura 1.1
     increases it's list of generally useful features by being able to
     make these frames follow a specific part of the main text around.
     Xerox calls  this "anchoring"  a frame  to text and may be reason
     enough for many people to spend  the  $100  on  the  upgrade. The
     reasoning behind anchoring a picture to text is that pictures are
     meant to go along with the text. An  example would  be a business
     FidoNews 4-28                Page 26                  27 Jul 1987


     report with several graphs, each graph goes along with a specific
     part of the report.  You  certainly  wouldn't  want  the employee
     attendance graph  to be  above the  section of the report dealing
     with quarterly sales, would you? Yet  this is  exactly what could
     happen if you added a few paragraphs of text or added the company
     logo to the top of the report. Ventura 1.1 puts an end  to having
     to  manually  readjust  every  graphics  (or text) frame when you
     change an earlier part of the publication. The  frame will follow
     the text  around every  time you make a change and Ventura allows
     you to anchor frames to text so that the frame will appear above,
     below or  on the  same page as the text it accompanies. I can see
     this having a large impact on the educational community as thesis
     papers  (especially  in  the  sciences,  maybe even the arts as I
     think  about  it)  won't  have  to  be  such  monumental efforts.
     Including  a  relevant  graph  in  the  text of the paper becomes
     trivial, and it will always show up where it belongs.

          One of the nicer additions to  me personally  is the support
     for Macintosh  MacPaint and PICT files. The MacPaint file support
     is nice because I have several of these already on my system. You
     may know  them better  as READMAC  pictures. All  of these can be
     brought right into Ventura. I no longer need to find a program to
     convert them  into PC  Paintbrush or  GEM Paint files. Sysops may
     see a renewed interest in their READMAC file area as people start
     looking around  for digitized  pictures to put into their work. I
     know I've spent quite a bit of time the past  week looking around
     several of the local boards and downloading such files.

          There are a few disappointments in Ventura 1.1. In the front
     of the  manual  there  is  an  errata  sheet.  While  support for
     Hewlett-Packard DDL  printers and Windows clipboard line art were
     not able to be included in this release  of Ventura.  It seems HP
     still hasn't  finalized the specification for DDL (not to mention
     not  shipping  any  printers   that  use   DDL)  and   until  the
     specification in finished and the printers shipped, Ventura won't
     support it. The Windows clipboard line art is  supposedly missing
     because   Xerox   has   been   unable   to  obtain  the  complete
     specifications on the metafile format. Support for both  of these
     items is  promised however,  and Xerox gives you a number to call
     if you need support  for DDL  or Windows  clipboard line  art. As
     soon as it is ready, they'll send it out to you.

          Overall I am still impressed with Ventura Publisher. Version
     1.1 includes  enough new  items (as  opposed to  bug fixes, which
     weren't to  many from what I hear) to make it a solid improvement
     over version 1.0. The  new  features  only  add  to  an excellent
     product. I may be prejudiced, but I think this product is an easy
     winner  over  PageMaker.  Most  of  the  people  in  the LASERPUB
     echomail conference  also seem  to think  the same  way. The only
     complaint I can recall on Ventura was due to someone  not knowing
     how  to  do  something  (as  opposed  to  not  being  able  to do
     something). If  you're going  to have  to buy  a page composition
     package in  the near  future, do  yourself a  favor and go find a
     dealer who really knows how to use Ventura and have  him give you
     a demonstration.

     -- WordPerfect 4.2 (WordPerfect Corp., list price $495.00) --

          I'll admit  it, I've been using WordPerfect for the past few
     weeks and haven't admitted it until  now. I  conned my  boss into
     buying it  for me at work and have been getting used to it before
     I "reviewed" it. I didn't want to say anything right away because
     it takes  me awhile to become accustomed to a new word processor.
     I didn't want to make the mistake of  saying it's  a poor product
     just because  I hit control-K Q to exit (Wordstar style commands)
     when it wants F7 Y Y (WordPerfect). I must admit that I  hated it
     when  I  was  still  becoming  accustomed  to  it,  but  am now a
     WordPerfect convert  and am  seriously considering  buying a copy
     for home  as well.  After getting  used to  how the function keys
     work (WordPerfect uses all 40 combinations on the  function keys;
     alone, alt-key,  ctrl-key, and shift-key) it is a remarkably easy
     word processor to use. My  boss  also  purchased  the WordPerfect
     Library, although I won't start going over it until next week.

          One of  the first things I noticed about WordPerfect is that
     it is fast. Supposedly this  is  because  WordPerfect  is written
     completely  in   assembler  while  many  other  word  processors,
     Microsoft Word included, are written in a mix of C and assembler.
     I don't know if this is actually true, but I do know that it is a
     lot quicker than Word. While it  doesn't do  some of  Word's nice
     displays,  in  many  cases  it's  easier  to use WordPerfect than
     Microsoft Word. In Word  I  could  only  spell  check  the entire
     document and that could take a long time (go to the library, tell
     it I want to do a spell check, etc.). WordPerfect  let's me check
     either  a  word,  page  or  entire  document.  I've  become  very
     accustomed to hitting Ctrl-F2 1  and  checking  the  word  I just
     entered.

          While  it  doesn't  have  Word's  style sheets, it does have
     built in macros;  either  the  Alt-key  variety  or  as  an eight
     character name.  The only  thing it is sadly missing is an editor
     for the  macros (they  aren't stored  in a  straight ASCII format
     like Superkey's  macros). In order to get a macro editor you must
     purchase the  WordPerfect  library.  The  macros  aren't  hard to
     learn, and in many cases are much more flexible than Word's style
     sheets. One of the first things I did when I started playing with
     it's macros  was create  one for  the start  of these columns and
     another with the complete signature. I used a variety of Superkey
     macros to  do this  in Word  and while  they were very similar, I
     decided to learn how to  do  it  in  WordPerfect.  If  you aren't
     familiar with  keyboard macros,  it's basically  a way of turning
     several keystrokes into one  (although that's  a weak comparison,
     it's the best I can do for now).

          Overall I've  been very  impressed with  it. While I haven't
     really gone into it very deeply, bear with  me over  the next few
     weeks while  I keep  learning more about it. Right now I can tell
     that it's going to become my word processor  of choice  (at least
     until I  come across something I like better). I just wish I been
     using it when all  I had  was a  4.77 mhz  XT, the  difference in
     speed would  have been  very nice. If you're looking around for a
     new word processor, I would definitely  say try  out WordPerfect.

     It is  fast, powerful,  and fairly easy to use. My biggest advice
     is to give yourself a chance to get used to it before  you decide
     against it.  I'll still  probably use Word when I'm looking for a
     variety of fonts (especially if I ever get a laser printer) since
     Word handles different fonts better than WordPerfect, but for all
     my other work I'll be using WordPerfect.

     -- Winding Down... --

          I've found a book  that may  help many  of you  as you break
     away  from   BASIC  into   Pascal  or  C.  It's  called  "Puzzled
     Programmers" by Michael Wiesenberg (Microsoft Press $12.95). It's
     a little  different as  it has several short stories accompanying
     each problem (of which there's  fifteen)  and  while  the problem
     doesn't actually relate to the story, they make for cute reading.
     Also included are hints to every problem as well as the solution.
     The solutions  are presented  in BASIC,  Pascal and C. One of the
     things Wiesenberg was  trying  to  accomplish  was  to  aid those
     learning a  new language. All three solutions to each problem use
     the same basic algorithm, so you can examine the solution  in the
     language  you  already  know  and  compare  it to the one you are
     trying to learn. This is supposed  to help  you see  how they are
     similar, and  how to  take advantage of the special techniques or
     principles  of  the  different  languages  (like  being  able  to
     initialize several  variables at the start of a loop in C). Since
     I already know all three of the languages used, I  wasn't able to
     really learn  anything with this book, but I can see how it might
     help someone  learn about  a new  language. The  problems are all
     mathematical problems,  several of  which could be solved without
     the aid of a computer. The hints rarely tell you  how to  write a
     program,  they  merely  guide  you  along  the way by helping you
     figure out how to solve a problem.

          I really support this method of learning. I've seen too many
     Computer Science  or MIS people graduate with honors and yet have
     no idea on how to solve  problems. To  many courses  on computers
     only deal  with syntax  and modifying  an existing program, often
     given to the students in  a  lecture  or  text,  to  do something
     slightly different.  To much of programming is determining HOW to
     do  something  to  ignore  teaching  the  students  how  to solve
     problems (or as I call it, thinking...but I'm fairly sarcastic in
     my attitudes these days). Books like this can  help out  those of
     you trying  to learn  how to  program more than many of the other
     books I've recommended  in  this  column.  Most  of  the  books I
     recommend already assume you can determine the steps necessary to
     accomplish a task, I think "Puzzled Programmers" will  help teach
     you this necessary skill. As I look over this paragraph I realize
     that I starting to climb up on my soapbox again, so I'm  going to
     wind  up  by  giving  high  marks  to  MIchael Wiesenberg on this
     excellent book.

     you're worried about Jane eavesdropping? (for an understanding of
     this  read  "Ender's  Game"  and  "Speaker for the Dead" by Orson
     Scott Card). I'd like to thank  you  for  the  package  you sent,
     although I don't have much use for it now. Hope to see all of you
     at FidoCon.

     These  ballots  will  be counted by myself since with 200 members
     the charges for a CPA would be very high.  Hard  copies  will  be
     made  available  to  anyone wishing to insure that their vote was
     included.
