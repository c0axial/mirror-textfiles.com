   You would think, after twenty or so years in the business,
that it would be possible to get a system written on schedule.
Everything would be tested beyond belief; all the hardware would
get installed and tested on time, and you could simply walk in
the door with three of four megs of code, plug it in, and
collect the admiring stares. (And the cheque, of course). Some
day, I swear, it is going to happen.

    We have a biggy system going in Tuesday. It is now Sunday,
two in the afternoon, and I have been hammering away at code for
seven hours so far today. Nearly everything works. (We think).

    The system is to be installed on a radio packet switched
network spread out over eight or nine hundred acres, and the
hardware guys swear that the computers are all working. When I
fired everything up on thursday, only one station managed to
connect. They say that thay have found the problem and things
will be ready. Ok. we'll believe you, though thousands would
not.

    When we asked one machine to test some traffic lights, it
turned on the red light first. Outside, the green light came
on. Then we tried the green light. The red light came on. Mmm.
Should be kind of amusing when we get twenty or so off-road
hundred-thousand-kilo trucks obeying the signs. I think walking
the ground with a set of walky-talkies might be in order. It
will get us away from the keyboard anyway. (Someday I will tell
you  about  burying  one  of  those  trucks  under about
one-half-million pounds of crushed stone. I *did* ask the driver
to get out first, but I do not think I will ever live it down.
Real-time testing is *such* fun).

    Anyway, it is time to get the snooze out the door.  Break
time is over. Hello world.

Not *THIS* BBS!
by Steve Lamb  1:203/1369

     This is partly in response to Terry Bowden's short article from
fido1021.nws regarding "Sensible BBS names in the Nodelist" and is to some
assumptions about Fido-Net as a whole.   Terry's article is just the
catalyst that got me to write this article.

>Now the nodelist is a listing of bulletin board systems, right?

     Wrong.  My system as of three weeks ago ceased it's BBS function
and went mail-only.  He is also forgetting that administration nodes
need not be BBS nodes.  The nodelist is a list of NODES.  Whether a BBS
is there are not is not part of the *NODE*list.
FidoNews 10-23                 Page:  3                    07 Jun 1993


>And every entry is a BBS, let's face it.

     Except for mail-only and Admin nodes.

>list a newcomer as The_Lantern_BBS, I generally suggest that
>"_BBS" is not necessary. Then again, do you really need "The_"

     To this, however, I *DO* agree!

>May I suggest that users and coordinators take this approach?

     Again, I agree.

     But the problem here is the assuption that ALL systems in the
nodelist are BBSs.  Last time I checked the ONLY requirement to be
listed in the Fido-Net nodelist was to have an operational mailer
running during Zone Mail Hour.  A mailer that can send and receive
netmail.  Nothing about BBSs.

     I hit this problem face first a few weeks ago when I decided that
after two years of running my BBS, the Abcb Cafe, I was going to take it
down.  However, I was going to leave my mailer running from midnight to
5am to send/receive the Fido-Net Echomail and Netmail that I,
personally, wished to participate in.

     Three weeks now and I'm still getting constant unsolicited netmails
to me because I am a "System Operator", SysOp.   I'M NOT!  Three weeks
now and I still cannot hand out this phone number to my friends and
family to call because constantly during the day the phone rings.  For
the past week there has not been one single human caller, it's all been
mailers!  The former callers of my BBS have gotten the point, when will
the rest of the net?

     And this is a problem.  The rules and regulations in Fido-Net are
quickly carrying it away from an amateur network.  I agree with many
things most people say about cutting down the size of the nodelist.
Let's remove redundant technical flags..  Face it, you cannot have v32b
w/o v32 so why have both?  Or even v22, v22b and so on?  But there are a
few flags I think should be left in for one reason.

     ALL SYSTEMS IN FIDO-NET ARE NOT BBSs!  Because of that reason, not
all of us are up 24 hours a day to receive mail.  We meet the minimum
requirements and just want to get our mail and be left alone.  For those
of us who want this, what is wrong with the -PVT- flag and -Unpublished-
for the phone number?  Because I do not run a BBS, which is not a
requirement for Fido-Net, I don't WANT people netmailing me at 2pm when
my friends and family may call.  I don't WANT people to know my phone
number.  I can have it unpublished in the phone book, why not Fido?

     Some will say, why not then become a point?  Pun intended, being a
point is NOT the point.  I meet the requirements, correct?  Now, ever
try to start an echo as a point and HUB the mail for that echo for other
nodes when you're a point.  I thought so.

FidoNews 10-23                 Page:  4                    07 Jun 1993

     At least when you are unpublished there are established routes to
get netmail to you.  Once they get there all it takes is for them to
enter the phone number for your node.  For a point it's an extra step,
they aren't in the nodelist, they are dependant on their bossnode who
may go down at any time and never return, and for the nodes the point
HUBs they have to create a new nodelist!

     It all comes down to this, why do people in Fido-Net assume that
every node in the nodelist is a BBS?  And why do we alienate people who
meet the minimum requirements of Fido-Net who have something to
contribute?  Is that, I ask, the attitude of an amateur network?

A Programmer's Nightlife

Hank Tassin
Navel Lint 1:3800/6.9

Sleep...
What is it?
Do our minds need it, do our bodies need it, or both? Or neither, we
just THINK we do?  Rest is one thing, although that may not be enough
to hold together that gooey mess we call a brain.  REM sleep may be a
diversion, it may be the recharging of the electro-chemical processors
in that gray matter we hold to be the keeper of life itself.  For that
matter, REM sleep could be the DIScharging of same, with the day's
activities serving to charge it up, when after a full day, you risk
overcharging.  The results would be the same, the electro-chemical
potential between one synapse and another would be reduced to low
levels lowering the flow.

Wiped out I was yesterday, but was able to hang on until the kiddies
went to bed.  Hit the pillow around 8:45pm, and took all of about 3
minutes to reach that oblivious state we cherish.  Wouldn't you know,
2:30am rolls around and my eyes spring open as if I had gotten all the
REM and rest I needed, so now it was time to do some serious coding in
Fox. (last thing I remembered the night before was thinking about the
program)

I get up, light up a smoke, put on a pot of coffee, and jump in the
shower.  Well, I musta showered in record time cause it was only
12:30am when I got out!  It doesn't matter though, cause I'm up in one
of those rare instances when I know laying back down in bed won't bring
the comforting blackness again. That's why the questions now....
what's it all about?

Stay well

-Hank

Connecting 9600 and beyond
                      CONNECTING 9600 AND BEYOND
                      ---------------------------
                      By Chip Morrow - 1:226/1400

 * Note to Fidonews readers - I am not an expert in high-speed data
   communications.  I ran a multi-node BBS for years however, and
   received lots of questions about 9600+ from my users.  This
   article was thrown together and posted for the people on my BBS,
   based on my few years of experience with USR HST and low-end
   v.32bis modems (I'm a cheapskate).  I tried to use layman's terms
   wherever possible.  I'm sure you won't agree with some of this.
   That's ok.  I don't expect you to.  If you CAN use any of this,
   or want to imbellish some or all of it for use elsewhere (a
   bulletin on your own BBS, a liner for your birdcage), that's ok
   too.  Now that I'm getting out of the BBS business, and this
   bulletin won't be available on my own board anymore, I thought
   I'd share it with anyone interested.

Free advice, and "For what it's worth" department:

I have been asked about 9600 BPS and beyond, transfer speeds, and
configuration settings more times than I care to think about, so the
time has come to sit down and write a bit on this subject.  In fact,
I've had to update this file at least two or three times now.  If
you are the least bit interested in upgrading to 9600 or 14400+ BPS,
(or maybe you just bought one and want some real-life information),
you might find this interesting.  Then again.... maybe not! <grin>

First some standard terminology:

  BPS     = Bits per second.  A "2400" modem travels at 2400 bps.
  CPS     = Characters per second.  A "2400" modem travels at about
            240 cps.
  MNP     = Microcom Networking Protocol (hardware error correction).
  MNP-5   = Microcom Networking Protocol (hardware data compression).
  V32     = The CCITT standard for 9600 BPS operation.
  V32.bis = The CCITT standard for 14,400 BPS operation.
  V42     = The CCITT standard for hardware error correction.
  V42.bis = The CCITT standard for hardware data compression.

  Now for some NON-STANDARD information that might prove useful in
  your travels:

  HST     = A proprietery 9600, 14400, and 16800 connection scheme
            used ONLY by US Robotics.

  ZYXEL   = A high-speed modem manufacturer that recently came out
            with a proprietery 16,800 connection scheme (and maybe
            19.2 now, from what I've heard).  Zyxels and USR's don't
            talk to each other at 16,800 (this will sound very
            familiar here in a bit).

            Zyxel modems *DO* also support the v.32 and v.32bis
FidoNews 10-23                 Page:  6                    07 Jun 1993

            standards.  But don't think you will get a 16,800
            connection to every other v.32bis modem in the world.
            You won't.  You'll get a 14.4 connection.

  Now for some "speed-freak-mood-dampening":

  DON'T BE FOOLED by the advertised throughput of 38,400 bps for v.32
  modems and 57,600 for v.32bis modems.  You will never see file
  transfer rates that high, but you *CAN* talk to your modem at that
  speed.  Here's a chart of what you should REALLY be expecting.

  Compressed files transferred via Zmodem with most bulletin boards:

                              ("Plain" means no MNP or V42)

           Type of modem:      1200   2400   v.32    v.32bis
                             +------------------------------+
   Characters per /    Plain |  112    234    940     1300  |
     second (CPS) \  MNP/V42 |  130    270   1100     1650  |
                             +------------------------------+
         Bits per /    Plain | 1120   2340   9400    13000  |
     second (BPS) \  MNP/V42 | 1300   2700  11100    16500  |
                             +------------------------------+

  ...so, when you see those advertisements for "38,400" and "57,600",
  don't believe it.  You can talk to your communications port at that
  speed, but you won't see that kind of throughput on your file
  transfers except in VERY, VERY unusual conditions.  How unusual,
  you ask?  ALL of the following has to be true:

      - You transfer nothing but text and/or compressible files,
      - You hook up with a modem that has the same computer-to-modem
        speed that you are using (38,400 or 57,600),
      - The file being transferred is VERY compressible,
      - You have a crystal clear phone line, and
      - You both have v.42bis compression enabled.

   Bottom lines:

      v.32 (9600) modems max out at about 1,100 cps.
      v.32bis (14400) modems max out at about 1,650 cps.

   Under ideal conditions, you might squeak a few more characters per
   second out of them, but on a continual basis you will speeds like
   these on relatively clean lines.  That's all there is to it.

   You *CAN* set your modem to report "CONNECT 38400" or "CONNECT
   57600", but don't believe it.  That is the "computer to modem"
   speed, not the actual connect rate.  I recommend you set your end
   to report the true modem-to-modem connect rate to avoid confusion
   (see the end of this article).

   Or, to look at it another way that might make more sense, v.32
   means around 60,000 bytes per minute, while v.32bis means just a
   hair shy of 100,000 bytes per minute.  So, when you see a file
FidoNews 10-23                 Page:  7                    07 Jun 1993

   that is 1 megabyte in size, it takes about 10 minutes to transfer
   it at v.32bis.  Let's move on...

              --------------------------------------------

So how did we get here?  The only way to start to talk about this is
via a history lesson as I see it.  Just some observations:

When you bought a 1200 or 2400 BPS modem, you stood a pretty good
chance of connecting 1200 or 2400 with almost any other modem out
there that said it supported the same speed.  Not so when we moved
to 9600, even worse when we went faster, thanks to the different
modem manufacturers ignoring the international standards.  Why, you
ask?

Many moons ago, the CCITT v.32 standard was not in use by anybody,
as it was deemed to be too expensive to realistically build hardware
to support the as-yet-unused international standard.  (All of that
has changed now).

Modem manufacturers retaliated by building their own proprietery 9600
connection schemes, and the next thing you knew there were modems all
over the place that wouldn't talk to any other brand at 9600 and
beyond.  (We still have a bit of this going on, with Zyxel and USR).

If you bought a CompuCom 9600, you had to find another CompuCom 9600
to connect to if you wanted 9600 BPS operation.  Etc. etc... this
carries over today - if you buy a straight US Robotics HST modem, you
must find another US Robotics HST (or Dual Standard) modem to connect
with if you want to connect above 2400 bits per second.  Quite a
letdown to buy an expensive high-speed modem only to travel at 2400!

Zyxel's 16,800 protocol is not compatible with US Robotics' HST
implementation of the same speed, so if you want to travel at 16800
with a Zyxel, you have to find another Zyxel to connect to.  (Yes,
again, the Zyxels *DO* drop to 14.4 and below using v.32/v.32bis).

Isn't this fun?  Here's why it came down that way:

As connect speeds increased, so did errors in data transmission.
Anyone who has ever used a "standard" modem of the 1200 or 2400 BPS
variety can verify that you do occasionally experience line noise,
which shows up as a burst of incomprehensible characters on your
terminal.  A 2400 BPS modem does not use NEARLY the bandwidth that
high-speed modems do, so you can imagine what happens with one of
these when you experience line errors.

That's why "error correction" and "data compression" are built into
the hardware on most of these things.  We'll talk about THOSE in a
bit here.

Before all settled down, the one that rose to the top of the heap in
the BBS world was USRobotics, with their proprietery HST modulation
scheme, which is still in use on MANY bulletin boards today.  USR is
still widely accepted in the BBS community as the leading
FidoNews 10-23                 Page:  8                    07 Jun 1993

manufacturer for BBS-compatible modems, but there is a price to pay
(more on this in a minute).  USR has since upped their proprietery
HST protocol to 14,400 bps, and most recently 16,800.  Problem is,
you NEED a USRobotics modem to talk to them at that speed.

USR does manufacture the "ultimate BBS modem" from my viewpoint, and
that is the USRobotics Courier HST Dual Standard, supporting both
their HST line, as well as the CCITT v.32 and v.32bis standards.
With one of these modems, you can connect to virtually any bulletin
board in the country at 9600 and beyond.

Perfection has a price, however.  The new Dual Standards are
retailing for over $1,000 apiece (although they can be had for $700
or so thru direct channels).  A little pricey from my standpoint.

  -----

Which brings us back to v.32 and v.32bis.  These are the accepted
international standards for high-speed modems, and they are only just
recently becoming widespread, and supported by MANY modem
manufacturers.  Virtually every modem manufacturer EXCEPT USR and
Zyxel have devoted their high-speed lines strictly to the CCITT v.32
and v.32bis modulation schemes.

   THE HIGHEST STANDARD SPEED MODEM THAT YOU CAN BUY IS V32.BIS,
   WHICH MEANS UP TO 14,400 MODEM-TO-MODEM SPEED.  PERIOD.

   There is a new protocol under development by the CCITT - and
   that is V.FAST.  V.FAST will probably be the last standard,
   as that will completely max out what the phone lines in this
   country are capable of.  If the modem you are considering says
   it will be upgradable to V.FAST when that standard matures,
   you may be able to upgrade painlessly.  You will pay a price
   for this promised upgradability.

Now, back to error correction and data compression.  You're likely to
have heard terms like MNP levels 1-5, v.42, and v.42bis.  Strangely
enough, NOT ALL HIGH-SPEED MODEMS SUPPORT THESE.  I have seen some
low-end v.32 modems that will connect at 9600 BPS, but with no error
correction, meaning that your high-speed connections will be
unreliable at best.  Let's talk about these terms for a bit:

   MNP = Microcom Networking Protocol.  There didn't used to be any
         standard for error correction/compression, and Microcom's
         implementation gained wide acceptance pretty quickly.  Most
         modems that support error correction support MNP.  There
         are several "levels" of MNP built into many modems, even
         more than I'm going to bring up here, but here's what a few
         of the more common methods mean (briefly):

         Levels 1 through 4 = Error correction.  The modems negotiate
                   to the highest-supported level on both ends, and
                   errors in transmission are "filtered" before they
                   get to the remote terminal.

FidoNews 10-23                 Page:  9                    07 Jun 1993

         Level 5 = Data compression.  If "compression" is turned on
                   on BOTH ENDS of the connection, and both modems
                   support MNP-5, the modems will negotiate to this
                   type of connection.  Theoretically, this can
                   increase throughput on file transfers.  But, in
                   reality, 90% of the files you transfer are already
                   compressed (ZIP, ARJ, LZH, etc.), so the overhead
                   of this protocol will actually slow you down.

 V.42 = The accepted international standard for error correction.
        It is generally felt that v42 hookups connect quicker and
        more efficiently than their MNP-4 equivalents.  Most modems
        supporting V42 will "fall back" to MNP-4 if a v42 connection
        couldn't be made, and to no error correction if both fail.

 V.42bis = ...and here's the international standard for data
        compression.  It is generally felt that v.42bis performs
        better than MNP-5, especially on noisy lines.  Most modems
        supporting v.42bis will "fall back" to MNP-5 if a v42.bis
        connection couldn't be made.  v.42bis is more efficient than
        MNP-5, and you will usually see higher throughput than with
        MNP-5.

Things to remember:

    - You're always limited by the phone lines in your area.  If you
      get static on the line when you make a voice call, you can
      amplify that several times over when you make a high-speed
      connection.  9600 and 14400 use just about all of the available
      bandwidth.  When V.FAST comes out, the bandwith will be
      completely used up.

    - ERROR CORRECTION is a must.  DATA COMPRESSION really isn't,
      although one tends to come with the other on most modems these
      days, and there are quite a few people who will tell you that
      you NEED v.42bis.  I have always seen the best transfer speeds
      with error correction on, and MNP5 data compression off.  The
      one exception is if you transfer a lot of text and/or data
      files that are NOT already compressed.  In that case, v.42bis
      data compression really can speed up your transfers a bit.

    - Many of these modems come with fax capability.  If you think
      you might want to be able to send and receive faxes right from
      your home PC, go ahead and get it.  The cost to include fax is
      minimal:  it only adds about $20.00 to the cost of the modem
      (mostly for the fax software), thanks to the Rockwell and AT&T
      v.32bis chipsets, which have fax capability built in.

    - Most any 9600 BPS modem (including the HST) will connect with
      any other high-speed modem at 2400 and below.  <<-----
                                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    - Zyxel's 16,800 BPS modem will connect 16,800 only with another
      Zyxel.  These modems WILL fall back to 14,400 and below, since
      they do follow the v.32 and v.32bis standards.

FidoNews 10-23                 Page: 10                    07 Jun 1993

    - USRobotics' HST, like any other modem using a proprietery
      scheme, will connect 9600 and beyond only to another USRobotics
      HST or Dual Standard modem.

    - USRobotics' HST Dual Standard (the pricey one) will connect
      9600 and beyond with both their own HST's, as well as v.32 and
      v.32bis modems (which is just about the whole high-speed
      market).  This works the other way, too, of course.

    - Any modem supporting v.32 should connect 9600 to any other
      modem supporting v.32 (from various manufacturers).

    - Any modem supporting v.32bis should connect 14400 with any
      other modem supporting v.32bis, as well as 9600 with v.32
      modems.

    - v.32 has one "fallback" speed: 4800 BPS, before those modems
      resort to 2400 for communications on "dirty" lines.

    - v.32bis has two additional fallback speeds: 12,000 and 7,200.
      v.32bis modems will also use the v.32 fallback speeds of 9,600
      and 4,800, if applicable.

          ------------------------------------------------------

My advice to you:

   Stay away from oddball 9600+ modems that won't talk to anything
   but other modems from the same manufacturer above 2400 bps.  USR's
   HST has a strong foothold in the BBS market, but that foothold is
   dwindling.  v.32 and v.32bis are here and now, and you have MANY
   different modem brands to choose from (commercial on-line services
   are already going to v.32).  I'm not knocking Zyxel - I've heard
   good things about them.  Just don't expect to get a 16.8 or 19.2
   connection to everybody.  You won't.

   Go v.32bis at 14,400.  Real-world pricing for low-end v.32bis has
   dipped all the way down to $200 apiece (even lower on some
   internal models) from several different manufacturers (Zoom and
   Boca, to name but a couple).  The price difference between v.32
   and v.32bis is minimal, but you gain 500 characters per second on
   your file transfers.  (That's like having an extra 4,800 bps modem
   built-in, to put it in perspective).

   Talk to your high speed modem FASTER than the actual connect rate
   - this will get you optimum file transfer speeds.  I suggest
   either 19200 or 38400 - you won't see much if any difference in
   throughput between these two on compressed files.  Your call.
   Whatever your system can handle.

   If you have a large wallet, get a USRobotics HST Dual Standard
   (*NOT* the cheaper HST model).  They are very good, reliable
   modems, and most communications & BBS software have setup info for
   them.  They were simply too expensive to be a practical option on
   this end.
FidoNews 10-23                 Page: 11                    07 Jun 1993


   Make sure your system can handle the speed before you buy.  You
   should have at LEAST an 8-10mhz machine (preferably a 286 or
   better), and it would be nice to have a 16550 UART on your serial
   port.  If you're in a multi-tasking environment, or you do find
   yourself dropping characters, you'll need a 16550 UART (which has
   a small built-in buffer to help out with this problem).

   Insist on error correction of some type, either MNP-4 or v.42.
   Otherwise, the line noise is likely to make life miserable for
   you.  You'll likely also receive data compression with your modem,
   since one tends to come with the other.

   If you aren't transferring text files, turn off data compression
   (especially MNP-5) for maximum throughput on compressed files like
   .ZIP, .ARJ, etc.  There are people who will tell you that you'll
   do BETTER with v.42bis enabled, but that hasn't been the case in
   my experience thus far.

   BE WARY OF USED v.32bis MODEMS FOR AWHILE.  Rockwell put out a bad
   set of the v.32bis chipsets a while back, and modem manufacturers
   were putting out updated ROMs for these modems at a bizzare rate.
   You want to be able to return the modem if it's broken.

         ------------------------------------------------------

Recommended configuration settings for Rockwell chipset v.32bis
modems, such as Zoom, Boca, generic brands, etc. etc:

Set your communications program as follows:

  - 19200 or 38400 port speed, and leave it there.  You can connect
    from 300 bps all the way up to 14400 with that port speed,
    believe it or not.

  - use CTS/RTS handshaking (not XON/XOFF)

  - Don't match connect rate (leave modem at 19200 or 38400 after
    connect).

  - Set your default file transfer protocol to something other than
    Xmodem!!!  Zmodem is recommended, YmodemG is better yet on REAL
    clean lines and with a good communications port, but a single
    error in transmission and you will lose the whole file transfer.
    That's why I recommend Zmodem.  Ymodem (or 1K-Xmodem) is pretty
    good, too, but Zmodem is better.

  - Set your initialization string to ATZ [ENTER].  That's really
    all you need, after you set up your modem.

Now set up your modem.

   AT&F                                  (reset to factory defaults)

   AT&C1&D2S95=3S38=2S11=55S37=11&W      (standard stuff - look at
FidoNews 10-23                 Page: 12                    07 Jun 1993

                                          your modem manual to see
                                          what each of these do).

If you don't like annoying high pitched screeching and howling in
your ear:

   ATM0&W

Then, to set the modem to your phone line:

   AT%E1\E1N0S37=9
   ATDTxxxxxxx

   (Replace "xxxxxxx" with the phone number of a local v.32 or
   v.32bis bulletin board).  After all the screeching and howling,
   you ought to get a 9600 connection.

This first connection might be a little strange - the modem is
training itself to the phone line.  After you have made a successful
connection, log off the BBS, and issue the command:

   ATZ

This will reset the modem to your defaults, and will allow you to
connect up to 14400 on subsequent calls.  From here on you just dial
out with ATDT, or from within your dialing directory of your
communications program.

"Your experiences may vary".  I have set up two Zoom v.32bis and
three Boca v.32bis modems this way, and had no trouble at all.  You
have a modem manual, if you want to dink with any of the settings
later.

So those are my opinions, worth what you paid for 'em.

Time to do away with Zone Mail Hour

by Kevin Eastman
(PVT) 1:3402/7 or (CM) 1:3402/25
Zone Mail Hour - A good idea whose time has PASSED

As any Fidonet system should know, and according to Policy 4,
Zone Mail Hour is "Supposedly" the heart of Fidonet. Well, this may
have been so when Fidonet only had a few systems, but now that Fidonet
has grown, Zone Mail Hour is more of an annoyance than a help. Lets take
a look at what Policy 4 has to say about Zone Mail Hour.

2.1.8  Exclusivity of Zone Mail Hour

Zone Mail Hour is the heart of FidoNet, as this is when network mail is
passed between systems.

- Well, considering that the majority of systems currently in Fidonet
- are considered CM, meaning they can recieve mail 24 hours a day, the
- above statement is redundant.

1. This time is exclusively reserved for netmail.
Echomail should not be transferred during ZMH.

- If one tried sending a netmail message to a system that has echomail
- on hold for them, with the mailers out today, there is no way to
- prevent recieving the echomail that is on hold. So, am I to understand
- that if I do, then I am in violation of Policy.

- I have found that whenever I have tried to send a netmail message
- to a system, especially a busy one such as a Star or an RC, more often
- than not, I have to try them outside of Zone Mail Hour, as, with all
- the systems in Fidonet all trying to send netmail at the same time,
- most people don't have a hope in you know what, of getting it through
- during Zone Mail Hour anyway.

User (BBS) access to a system is prohibited during ZMH.

- I, like many other people out there, do not have a lot of money for
- calling long distance to access a BBS. So, the only solution is to do
- it when the phone companys rates are cheaper. Unfortunately, this is
- also the time when everyone is trying to send their netmail and
- echomail, so even without Zone Mail Hour, Users already have to
- compete with the normal mail flow. We run our systems as a hobby for
- ourselves and our users, including the ones calling long distance, and
- to deny those long distance users access during that time set aside
- for Zone Mail Hour is very annoying. As some systems are SO busy,
FidoNews 10-23                 Page: 14                    07 Jun 1993

- I consider it accessively annoying to make users wait that one extra
- hour to get on a system.

Many phone systems charge on a per-call basis, regardless of whether a
connect, no connect, or busy signal is encountered.

- So????? That is a problem between the system operator and their phone
- company. It has nothing to do with the operation of my, and the
- majority of the other systems in Fidonet. As a wise person once said,
- "The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, or the one."

For this reason, any activity other than normal network mail processing
that ties up a system during ZMH is considered annoying behavior.

- So you have a choice, you can be guilty of annoying behaviour for
- processing mail only, or you can be guilty of annoying behaviour for
- allowing the transferral of echomail and allowing users on your system
- during that one hour. Personally, I think the users are more
- important, as, without them, whats the point of running a continuous
- system.

We are in our fourth year of operation, and feature echomail
conferences covering just about every aspect of the Star Trek universe,
whether it be a race such as Vulcans, Romulans or Bajorans; or a
department such as engineering, communications or security.  In
addition, we offer conferences helping Fans locate clubs near them,
announcing and discussing conventions, and offer support services to a
growing number of Fan Organizations.

Topics you'll find on Treknet (tm) include such Treknological ones as
Warp Drive limitations and technology, the discussion of various ship
classes and their design and capabilities, security practices, Starfleet
Intelligence operations, and more.  More "mundane" topics include how to
publish a newsletter, fanzine or other publication, how to run a con,
finding crash space for an out-of-town con, finding a fan club near you,
and more!

We currently have members or representatives of many different Star
Trek fan clubs online with Treknet (tm), including KAG, KLAW,
Starfleet Marines, Starfleet International, The Federation, Starfleet
Command, Starfleet Rangers, Star Trek Welcommittee, the BSTA and many,
many local groups!
