                           What's Going On Here?


     It's probably about time I explained how I do this  again,  since
     I've made some changes.  Nothing sudden, just a slow evolution.

     Some  of you may have noticed (I wonder how many?) that we tucked
     in an  extra  file  last  week,  FNEWSART.DOC.  It's  an  updated
     description  of  the technical specs.  If you're a sysop,  please
     post it on your board.  If you plan to write an article (which  I
     hope you are), then please at least scan it briefly.  You'll make
     my job whole bunches easier.

     The  most noticeable change is that we widened the margins a bit,
     and  cut  down  the  left  margin.  (The  left  margin  has  been
     "creeping" for awhile, but you probably didn't notice.) After ten
     months  of  reformatting  articles,  I decided that sixty columns
     wasn't really a good number.  It  seemed  just  a  tiny  bit  too
     short,  so I widened it to sixty five columns.  I'd played around
     with that awhile before  actually  doing  it.  It's  amazing  how
     often those extra five columns make all the difference.

     But  the  biggest  change,  and one that only authors of articles
     have noticed,  is that we've introduced a delay into how long  it
     takes  for  an article to appear.  (To an extent,  in fact,  this
     editorial is something of an apology to those  of  you  who  have
     sent  articles.) When I first started doing this,  everything was
     published practically the moment it was received.

     In those days  I  was  desperate  for  anything  at  all,  and  I
     typically  sent out a newsletter wondering where in the world I'd
     find anything to put in the next one.  That's not such a  problem
     anymore, but we still seem to get articles in "spurts".  I'll get
     two  articles  one  week,  and  then a dozen the next.  I somehow
     doubt you'd like  getting  a  five  page  newsletter  this  week,
     followed by a fifty page newsletter next week.  Hence the delay.

     Everything  here  is  still automated up the kazoo.  I could drop
     dead tomorrow, and the newsletter would continue to go out for as
     long as my machine keeps running.  But  the  built-in  delay  now
     gives me a chance to even things out a bit.  So if I get a ton of
     stuff one week and nothing the next,  I can push some things back
     to even it out a bit.

     I guess this is really just a long-winded way of telling you that
     if I don't publish your article right away,  it's not  because  I
     canned  it.  I  feel  that if you took the trouble to write some-
     thing,  the least I owe you is an explanation if it doesn't go in
     (very rare, we really DO publish almost anything).

                             or the lack of it


       I had a very bitter experience with a software house the  other
     day  that  I  want  to relate to you.  I went out on Saturday and
     purchased DoubleDos from SoftLogic of New Hampshire.  As  I  knew
     of  several other sysops who used it I,  thought it should not be
     any problem to install on my Tandy 1200.  This it turned out  not
     to be the case.  I had thought that I had found that .01 per cent
     piece  that would not run,  so I decided to call up the help line
     that SoftLogic had to see what I would need to do.

       The person who answered the phone seemed to know exactly what I
     needed to do to get up and running.  He  said  I  would  need  to
     download  a  file  from their BBS in the evening,  copy it to the
     root directory under a different name,  and all  would  be  fine.
     This  encouraged  me  as  I am really beginning to enjoy cruising
     when ever I get the chance.  So that evening I call up the board,
     log in and proceed  to  the  files  section.  There  it  is,  the
     package  that  I  am supposed to get.  I ask for download and the
     system comes back and asks for the password.  As I had gotten  it
     that  morning  I  confidently entered the password and hit enter.
     What is this?  "SYSOP must authorize"!  Maybe  this  board  needs
     upper  case.  Type  type enter.  Once again that dratted message.
     Back to the message file.  Enter a complaint.  Back to the files.
     Try again.  Oh oh, lockout and log off.

       So I try the next night.  This time the board will  not  answer
     the  phone.  I try calling the next morning and get someone else.
     He explains to me that the system crashed the night before but he
     will give me the password for that night.  I call back  and  find
     out  that this time I can't get in as my privilege level is 0.  I
     can't do anything.  I log off, call back under my middle name and
     find out all is well.  I leave a message for the sysop, go to the
     files,  and try to download the needed file.  Once again  I  find
     out  that the password I have is no good.  At this point I am out
     four  phone  calls  to  New  Hampshire  and  gotten  nothing  but
     frustration.  I  leave  a  long  and pointed message on the board
     hoping that someone  there  has  enough  sense  to  realize  that
     something  is  wrong.  I very carefully leave some secret numbers
     that if decode by means of a modem will call up my bulletin board
     and let them call me.

       As they have not bothered to call me, I figure that they do not
     need the business.  Then today in talking to one  of  the  people
     that I know in the software world,  he said something that rang a
     bell.  I came home and did some modifications to my DOS and  then
     tried this errant product.  This time it worked.

       The  purpose  of  all  this  is to alert some of these software

     houses that sysops are what might be called people of  influence.
     It  is  not  a good idea to give a bad impression to them as they
     may not give a recommendation to your product.  As it  is,  there
     is no way that I could give a recommendation to this product.  It
     works, but not because of the manufacturer, but because I had the
     good  fortune to know someone that had the same problem.  Also it
     is pass along the word to those  who  read  this,  ask  questions
     first,  then make sure it will work on your machine,  then try it
     on your machine.  If it doesn't work,  walk away.  If it was from
     SoftLogic, don't expect any support.  Their system is not capable
     of providing it.

     Since setting up our Fido board many months ago I  have  been  on
     the  lookout  for  a way to create a community service.  It first
     started with a kids-world area for teenagers  and  youngsters  to
     have  an  area of their own.  Then I created an island-guide area
     for  people  to  discuss  various  things  about  the  community,
     restaurant menus etc.  Even a high tech area.  I did not want the
     computer  station's  Fido  to  be  just  a  file dumping area.  I
     encouraged users to help each other with their computer problems.
     I constantly kept looking for ideas .

     In November of 1986 I had to leave Hawaii to go to COMDEX, always
     a hectic task for me.  At COMDEX I was deluged by vendors wanting
     me to buy there software to try or demo.  A few years ago  I  had
     made  a  policy  not to buy any new software until I either had a
     demo of it to try first or had a working package  to  use  for  a
     period of time.  I became overwhelmed with software.

     After  COMDEX  I  decided  I  would  ask  the  manufacturers  for
     permission to mount their self running or crippled demo  software
     on  the  computer station's Fido board.  I explained to them that
     this would allow a number of my users to play around with and try
     the software.  Not only does this allow a number of people access
     to programs where they would not normally have  even  known  that
     the demos exist, it also hopefully would discourage piracy of the
     software as most people do it just to try out the program.

     So as of Dec 1, 1985 Fido 113/436, The Computer Station has a new
     area   called   EVAL.   I  have  received  permission  from  such
     manufacturers as Ashton Tate to mount their Framework II sampler,
     Borland to mount their Sidekick  demo,  and  more.  I  have  also
     talked  some  of  my  users  into  creating an evaluation form to
     follow and encouraged them to "check out" different software with
     the  understanding  that  they  cannot  copy  it,  and  to  write
     independent  evaluations  following  the set guidelines that they
     had drawn up.

     It is interesting that a number of manufacturers have not thought
     of this  before  and  all  the  sudden  they  are  becoming  very
     enthusiastic about the idea.  If other Fido boards are interested
     in  offering  this  type  of service in various areas I recommend
     that they contact me and I will try to arrange to  get  the  demo
     files  to  you.  You  can  contact  me at Fido 113/436,  MCI Mail
     256-1444, The Source bkp893, or Compuserve 70406,1662.

     Date: 2-12-86
     To:   Fido Sysops
     From: Mark Welch (Sysop of Fido 125/459)
     Re:   Demo Version of the Generic Adventure Game System

         A lot of sysops weren't happy that I added  two  editors  and
     some  extra  documentation  to  the newest version of the Generic
     Adventure Game System,  since the new GAGS106A.ARC file now takes
     up over 280K, which represents about one hour at 1200 bps.  After
     some  careful  thought,  I decided to release a "demo version" of
     GAGS to reduce some of the problem.

         GAGSDEMO.ARC contains the same GAGS "engine" and sample  game
     as  the full system in one 89K ARC file,  but doesn't include the
     two editors or the full documentation.  All the rest of the files
     are bundled into GAGS-ETC.ARC, which weighs in at just over 200K.

          Please note that this  new  packaging  does  NOT  change  my
     distribution policy: GAGS is still release as "Shareware" and can
     be  freely copied or downloaded in its entirety.  The full set of
     files are also available in the file GAGS106A.ARC from my BBS and
     others.

          It does maintain my insistance that GAGS only be distributed
     the way I provide it,  so that no  one  will  be  upset  (at  me)
     because they downloaded the COM file without the overlays, or the
     executable  files  without  the  documentation.  In  other words:
     please don't repackage GAGS when you post it on your  BBS,  since
     this  will  create support problems for me.  (Remember,  my voice
     phone number is listed in every file!)

          If you feel a 280K download is too  large,  please  consider
     posting  GAGSDEMO.ARC  on  your board.  Not only is it a complete
     adventure game exercising most of the features available in GAGS,
     but it allows users to  spend  less  time  downloading  the  file
     before deciding if it's something they're interested in.

          By  the way,  there are now five more sample games for GAGS,
     written by Ev Cheney (sysop  of  Fido  125/3)  and  Stan  Heller.
     They're combined in a file SAMPLES.ARC on my board.

          (For  those  who  didn't see earlier FidoNews articles:  the
     Generic  Adventure  Game  System  is  is  a  text  adventure-game
     development  system  for  MS-DOS computers with 256K.  It runs on
     the IBM PC, DEC Rainbow, Sanyo 550/555, TI Professional, and,  so
     far,  every  256K  MS-DOS  computer  it's  been  tested on.  It's
     released as Shareware: if you like it, please register by sending
     me $15.  The Turbo Pascal source code is available to  registered
     users for $25 more.)

        THREE OFFERS:

           1) I  will  send a copy of GAGSDEMO.ARC via FidoMail to any
              U.S.  Fido sysop who requests it with a Fido message  to
              Fido 125/459.  Please, only one such per net: I'll refer
              subsequent nodes in the net to the first system.

           2) BBS  Sysops  can get a copy of GAGS by sending me a disk

              and a self-addressed,  post-paid disk mailer (specify if
              you  want  the  one 280K file or the DEMO and ETC files.
              Include 2 disks and I'll put both versions in, or if you
              want I can give you the sample game ARC file).

           3) As always,  the current version of GAGS is available  to
              anyone for $10, (includes disk, mailer, and postage).

                      New NODELIST Distribution Method
                         by Ben Baker, Fido 100/76

          Maybe you haven't noticed,  but  the  nodelist  is  becoming
     quite large.  If there is no satellite link,  it takes about four
     and a half minutes to transmit NODELIST.A59  at  2400  baud,  and
     nearly eight minutes at 1200 baud.  It took OVER eight minutes at
     2400 baud to send it via satellite to Hawaii!

          We  now  have about eight hundred nodes in the nodelist.  If
     we assume an average of six minutes transmission time  per  node,
     that's  about eighty hours a week to distribute a new nodelist to
     everybody!  If only ten per cent is long distance, that's still a
     non-trivial sum we're giving Ma  Bell  each  week!  In  order  to
     reduce  the  overhead  of nodelist distribution,  we are making a
     change to the distribution format.

          NODELIST.A73 will be a  particularly  fat  nodelist  archive
     file.  It  will contain some extra files which are very important
     to you.  The complete contents of the file are as follows:

               COORD.073
               NODELIST.073
               NODEDIFF.073
               EDITNL.ARC    consisting of
                 EDITNL.COM
                 EDITNL.DOC

          NODEDIFF.073 will be a file which represents the differences
     between NODELIST.066 and NODELIST.073 in a rather simplistic edit
     command  format.   EDITNL  is  the  program  which  can construct
     NODELIST.073 from NODELIST.066  and  NODEDIFF.073.   It  will  be
     instructive  to  compare  the  sizes of the NODELIST and NODEDIFF
     files.

          DO  NOT  ALLOW YOUR BATCH FILE TO THROW AWAY NODELIST.066 ON
     YOU!  You will only have one week to  familiarize  yourself  with
     EDITNL  and  its  use, and you will need NODELIST.066 to do that.
     NODELIST.A80 will contain only COORD.080  and  NODEDIFF.080,  and
     you will have to construct NODELIST.080 using EDITNL.

          Since  EDITNL  will  be an "essential" program, those of you

                             NOTES FROM THE UK
                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Frank Thornley - UK Fido Coordinator

     After several months of  circulating  the  net  it  appears  that
     several   copies   of   the  ill  fated  European  FidoNews  have
     materialized on the crowded desktop of Thom  Henderson.  Most  of
     the  articles  have  appeared without any reference to myself and
     also contain references to issues and persona known only  in  the
     UK.  I  apologize  if this has caused any confusion but we didn't
     really expect our newsletter to cross the pond.

     You will note that I have referred to  the  'Ex'  nature  of  the
     European  FidoNews.  Unfortunately  there  wasn't enough input to
     make production worthwhile and therefore most  of  the  editorial
     came  from me.  I don't mind sounding off about this and that but
     I disliked being the main contributor as  my  opinions  may  have
     been construed as being somewhat dictatorial.

     We have sorted out our distribution problems for the US FidoNews,
     world nodelist, and Fido updates so Europe specific issues can be
     put  in the US FidoNews with reasonable certainty of reaching the
     parts other newsletters cannot reach <Anglophile Humor>.

     The time  has  come  to  unleash  my  manifold  opinions  on  the
     unsuspecting  world  -  Robert Maxwell <UK counterpart of T.Boone
     Pickens> watch out!

     With reference to my earlier articles you can refer all  comments
     etc  to  Frank  Thornley  -  Compulink,  503/1.  The  articles in
     question concern - Exchange of public domain software,  Compulink
     in general, and fitting a hard disk to a Compaq Portable.

     Since  the  aforementioned  articles  things  have been a movin'.
     Compulink is basically a user group for IBM-PC's and compatibles.
     The user group is doing pretty well in  the  UK  and  Europe  and
     provides enough income to pay for a small office with a full time
     staff  of  two (myself and Sylvia - my spouse),  and a cluster of
     PC's and AT's which form the  basis  of  the  Compulink  Bulletin
     Board System.

     I  started  Compulink  in late 1984 after living in Florida for a
     few months I became involved with user groups and bulletin boards
     while I was over there <here> and when I was  finally  forced  to
     leave  through  lack  of  funds I decided to start a similar user
     group in the UK.  Since then we have run several bulletin  boards
     and  amassed  a  large  collection of public domain software.  In
     user group fashion we distribute the software in  the  UK  for  a
     token fee and also provide the services of our BBS.

     We have lots of other activities,  meetings,  workshops etc,  but
     most of my time goes into running the BBS.  We used  to  run  the
     board from the spare room,  but subscribers used to complain that
     they could never get online as the  BBS  was  so  busy.  We  were


     Fidonews                     Page 9                    3 Mar 1986





     forced  to  turn  our  voice  line  over  to the BBS as the phone
     company (British Telecom) couldn't get any more  lines  down  our
     street.  Thus  we  were  forced  to  take  office  premises.  Not
     wishing to be constrained through lack of lines we installed six.

     Now we had the lines and the office,  but only one  computer.....
     Using  the  Multilink software we could run two Fido's but how do
     we run more than two?  The obvious answer was to buy  more  PC's,
     this  we  did  but  then  came  across another problem - resource
     sharing.  The only way was to install a LAN.  As we were  already
     using  Multilink we decided to give Lanlink a try.  After several
     weeks of experimenting we came up with a workable  system.  Right
     now the Compulink BBS is rum from a PC-AT which acts as a server,
     and two PC's which are satellites.  The resource sharing works OK
     and  I  can  recommend  the  Multilink/Lanlink combo very highly.
     There are some problems but we are working on it.

     If anyone is considering trying this out themselves  I  would  be
     glad  to  advise,  call  our  office  +44  483  65895.  Prior  to
     installing the AT we tried to use a PC with the PC-ElevATor  card
     from Applied Reasoning.  This combination didnt work with Lanlink
     because  Lanlink  uses  baud  rates  up  to 256K baud,  which the
     ElevATor cant handle.  We tried  slowing  Lanlink  down  to  9600
     which  the  ElevATor  can  handle  but  it was too slow.  Another
     problem was the PC's limit of two com ports.  Multilink  can  use
     special cards which support up to eight com ports but these cards
     were  in  my  opinion unnecessarily expensive.  I found a company
     selling a similar card (made in Taiwan) and  as  this  cost  just
     $130, (4 com ports).

     I suggest if you are thinking of using this setup that you try to
     find  a  supplier  for this 'Eastern Alternative'.  The multi-com
     card is not strictly necessary for a Multilink only setup, but as
     Lanlink uses one com port for the serial link  to  the  satellite
     computer more com ports are necessary.  At the moment we have the
     standard  two  com  ports  on  the  AT  plus  the  multi-com card
     providing an  extra  four  com  ports.  We  currently  run  three
     multilink partitions - two for our first two Fido's,  and one for
     the Lanlink Server program.  The AT appears perfectly capable  of
     handling  three  partitions  with  no  noticeable  delays  to the
     callers on Fido.  The satellites run Multilink too - again  using
     the  multi-com  card  but  speed degradation is a problem at 1200
     baud.

     We maintain the BBS remotely through remote  terminals  and  once
     the hardware was running properly we didn't even have to take the
     system off-line to do sysop maintenance or updating files areas.

     All  in  all  we  are delighted with the setup and intend further
     expansion when necessary.  Its a good feeling to  see  more  than
     one  caller  online,  but  the  callers  can't contact each other
     directly.  The next thing I'd like to see in Fido is  a  multiple
     input stream,  and more support for multi-user systems - Not that
     I'm  complaining  though.   We  have  got  scope   for   'lateral
     expansion'  thanks  to  the  new  'O'  -outside  command.   We're
     currently  running  the  'Common  Ground'  conferencing  software
     outside Fido and I'll write a report on this soon.

     Finally I'd like to offer an invitation to all Fido Fans that are
     visiting the UK in the future.  Let us know and we'll help in any
     way we can.  Every time I hear about a Fido sysop visiting the UK
     I  try to make contact.  I located Andy Kanter from Beyond War on
     his last day in the UK and know of several others I have  missed.
     You  can crash out at our house for a while if you like,  ask Tom
     Jennings - he stayed for a few days in November, we'd love to see
     you !!

                Two Utilities for reducing Disk Access Time


     No matter what type of PC, XT, AT, or clone you own,  most of you
     will  have  somehow  managed  by  now to push your machine to its
     limits,  and are looking for something to make your programs  run
     faster.  In today's market, there are a variety of products which
     may be used to increase the throughput of your machine, either by
     making it process instructions faster,  or by reducing the amount
     of time spent accessing data.

     For this review,  I will cover two software products which may be
     used  to  provide  greater throughput on your machine by reducing
     the disk access time require to load data from  your  hard  drive
     (or  floppy)  into  memory.  The  two products are Disk Optimizer
     (version 1.2) by Soft  Logic  Solutions,  and  Lighting  (version
     3.06) by Personal Computer Support Group.

     These  two  products  attempt  to  reduce  the  disk  access time
     required to load data into memory using two completely  different
     approaches.  Both products may be used on DOS 2.0 or higher, both
     are successful in their goal to reduce disk access time, and both
     are  relatively  inexpensive.  However,  the product that you may
     want to use will depend upon the type of processing you use  your
     machine  for,  and  the  amount  of  memory  you  are  willing to
     sacrifice (or purchase) for reduced access time.

     The first product, Disk Optimizer, is a directory and file sector
     reorganizer.  It reduces the access time required to process data
     by reducing the amount of time required to physically access  the
     data.  This  utility  (1)  reorganizes  all  your  directories by
     removing all deleted file entries from  them  and  releasing  all
     unused  clusters,  and (2) defragmentize all files so that all of
     each file's data is localized in one contiguous area on the disk.
     This utility is typically used to process your  hard  disk  on  a
     periodic basis,  such as once per week, or you may use their Disk
     Analyzer program to determine when you want  to  reorganize  your
     hard drive with Disk Optimizer.

     Typically, a 10 Meg XT hard drive will take anywhere from 5 to 30
     minutes to process the first time with Disk Optimizer,  since the
     hard drive is expected to be badly fragmented the first time  you
     run  Disk  Optimizer against it.  Subsequent processing with Disk
     Optimizer will usually take about 5  minutes.  This  may  be  too
     much time for some people to spend reorganizing their hard drives
     when  the  applications  which  they  are  using  may  not be I/O
     intensive enough to make the gains  of  reduced  physical  access
     time significant.

     The  second  product,  Lighting,  is  a configurable disk caching
     utility which is installed as a resident program;  you  have  the
     option  of  specifying  what  drives  you  want  the disk caching
     utility to process and the amount of memory you wish to use for a
     disk cache.  Lighting reduces the  amount  of  time  required  to
     process  frequently  accessed  data  by maintaining a copy of the


     Fidonews                     Page 12                   3 Mar 1986





     data in a cache,  so that physical disk access may be  eliminated
     or reduced.  Lighting is also capable of using as much as 1.5 Meg
     of Lotus/Intel/Microsoft expanded memory; so if you have expanded
     memory  or if you thinking about buying expanded memory,  you can
     dedicate as much as 1.5 Meg toward a disk cache.

     Lighting can only be successful in reducing disk access time  for
     you  if  it  can  maintain  your  frequently accessed data in its
     cache; otherwise it will have to constantly perform a disk access
     to bring your data into the cache and to  load  it  into  memory.
     The  typical  solution  to  this  problem  (cache swapping) is to
     increase the size of the cache (if you have the  memory),  or  to
     use  both  a  cache  and  a  RAM  disk  and  have your frequently
     processed READ ONLY files on the RAM disk.

     The following test results were obtained on an IBM XT with  a  10
     Meg hard drive, and a Fountain XT with a 30 Meg hard drive.  Both
     systems  were  using  PC-DOS  3.1  with  BUFFERS=20  and FILES=20
     defined in CONFIG.SYS,  and identical results were obtained  from
     both systems.

     For the first test, the IBM Personal Editor II (88 K) and a large
     file  (107  K)  were  used  to  determine  how Disk Optimizer and
     Lighting (with 350 K cache) affect the initial load time  of  the
     editor  and its data.  This test is designed to be representative
     of a user  running  a  typical  application  which  requires  the
     loading of a fairly large program with overlays or tables and the
     initial processing of user information,  such as WordStar,  Lotus
     1-2-3, Symphony, or Framework.

     A freshly formatted hard drive was used to create  the  data  for
     the  first  test.  The  editor and its files were copied onto the
     hard drive with a scrambler program to create randomly fragmented
     files,  and Disk Optimizer was used to defragment the files.  The
     initial loading time of the fragmented files and the defragmented
     files, accessed through DOS (normal access) and through Lighting,
     are shown in Table A.


                                Table A
                                -------

                            Initial Load Time in seconds
                         --------------------------------------
         Fragmented           34      |       35         28
         Defragmented         31      |       32         27
                         --------------------------------------
                            normal    |    1st time   Nth time
                          DOS access  |  accessed using Lighting
                                            with 350 K cache


     The  results  in Table A show that Disk Optimizer does reduce the
     access time required to load both the editor and  its  data  into
     memory,  and  this  reduced access time is apparent regardless of
     whether the editor and its data are accessed through BIOS (normal
     DOS access) or through Lighting.  Also shown in Table A,  is that
     Lighting  has  made  a  dramatically  greater  improvement in the


     Fidonews                     Page 13                   3 Mar 1986





     editor test than Disk Optimizer has.  This is shown in the  third
     column of Table A which represent the loading time for the editor
     and  its  data after all the accessed information has been loaded
     into a cache;  the second column represents the  initial  loading
     time  which  is  slightly  longer because the data has to be read
     from the hard drive and loaded into  the  cache.  Thus  it  seems
     that Lighting is a clear choice if you have memory to spare for a
     disk  cache,  and  if you have a set of files which you intend to
     access frequently.  However,  if you access too many files or  if
     your  files are larger than the cache,  then you may actually get
     degraded results with Lighting.  Using the same  test  as  before
     with  a  175  K  cache,  the  following  results  (Table  B) were
     obtained.


                                Table B
                                -------

                            Initial Load Time in seconds
                         --------------------------------------
         Fragmented           34      |       35         35
         Defragmented         31      |       32         32
                         --------------------------------------
                            normal    |    1st time   Nth time
                          DOS access  |  accessed using Lighting
                                            with 175 K cache


     As you can see,  when the size of the cache is too small for  the
     data  being  processed,  the cache will not be useful in reducing
     the disk access time in the editor test.

     And for the last test,  System Enhancement Associates' ARC (33 K)
     and  a  large  ARC  file  (170  K)  were  used.  The  test was to
     determine the effect  of  Disk  Optimizer  and  Lighting  on  the
     command:  "ARC  t arcfile",  which is representative of processes
     which perform both a large amount of I/O and CPU in  tandem.  The
     following results (Table C) were obtained.


                                Table C
                                -------

                            Initial Load Time in seconds
                         --------------------------------------
         Fragmented           137     |      137        137
         Defragmented         137     |      137        137
                         --------------------------------------
                            normal    |    1st time   Nth time
                          DOS access  |  accessed using Lighting
                                            with 350 K cache


     Here  is  an  obvious  example of where neither Disk Optimizer or
     Lighting will have any effect on the  process  involved,  because
     the bottle neck in this process is CPU and not I/O.

     So  here  you  have  it,  a comparison of both Disk Optimizer and

     Lighting, and how these two products may be used to decrease disk
     access time, and examples of situations where these programs will
     and will not be a benefit to you.

     We have a confession to make.  We've been  holding  out  on  you.
     For  several years now we've been using a program called MACRO to
     boost our productivity.  But we've  been  keeping  it  a  closely
     guarded secret.  Even our most intimate clients have been unaware
     of it's existence.  Now,  however, we've decided to release it to
     the PC user community.

     If you have ever used a macro assembler,  then you  already  know
     how  useful  macros  can be.  For the rest of you,  well,  a good
     macro processor can do half of your work  for  you.  MACRO  works
     with  any  normal text file,  and hence can be used as a powerful
     front-end to almost any language.  Here's a sample of what  MACRO
     can do for you:

     1. Put parameters in your programs, allowing you to easily change
        table sizes, ranges of values, and so forth.

     2. Put  conditional code in your programs,  allowing you to write
        one program,  and then "switch" parts on and  off  easily  for
        different customers and applications.

     3. Perform integer arithmetic and string manipulation before your
        program is compiled, saving run time.

     4. Write  programs  that  customize  themselves  when you compile
        them,  based on commands given and questions  answered  during
        the macro scan.


     MACRO is available for only $95 from

                       System Enhancement Associates
                       21 New Street, Wayne NJ 07470

     Or  call  our  convenient  order line at (201) 473-5153 (VISA and
     MasterCard accepted).



     Mention that you saw  this  ad,  and  we'll  donate  $10  to  the
     national FidoNet coordinators when you order.

              Now available from Micro Consulting Associates!!

     Public Domain collection - 300+  "ARC"  archives  -  10  megs  of
     software  and  other  goodies,  and that's "archived" size!  When
     unpacked,  you get approximately 17 megabytes worth of all  kinds
     of  software,  from text editors to games to unprotection schemes
     to communications programs, compilers, interpreters, etc...

     This collection is the result of more than 10 months of intensive
     downloads from just about 100 or more BBS's  and  other  sources,
     all  of  which have been examined,  indexed and archived for your
     convenience.  Starting a Bulletin Board System?  Want to  add  on
     to your software base without spending thousands of dollars? This
     is the answer!!!

     To  order  the  library,  send  $100  (personal or company check,
     postal money order or company purchase order) to:

                    Micro Consulting Associates, Fido 103/511
                    Post Office Box 4296
                    200-1/2 E. Balboa Boulevard
                    Balboa, Ca. 92661-4296

     Please allow 3 weeks for delivery of your order.

     Note:  No profit is made from  the  sale  of  the  Public  Domain
     software  in  this  collection.  The price is applied entirely to
     the cost of  downloading  the  software  over  the  phone  lines,
     running  a  BBS  to  receive  file  submissions,  and inspecting,
     cataloguing, archiving and maintaining the files.  Obtaining this
     software  yourself  through  the  use  of a computer with a modem
     using commercial phone access would cost you much more than  what
     we charge for the service...

     Please specify what type of format you would like the disks to be
     prepared on.  The following choices are available:

             IBM PC-DOS Backup utility
             Zenith MS-DOS 2.11 Backup Utility
             DSBackup
             Fastback
             Plain  ol' files (add $50,  though,  it's a lot  of
             work and takes more diskettes...)

     Add  $30  if  you  want  the  library  on  1.2 meg AT disks (more
     expensive disks).  There are no  shipping  or  handling  charges.
     California residents add 6% tax.

     For each sale, $10 will go to the FidoNet Administrators.
