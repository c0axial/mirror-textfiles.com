     =================================================================

     Greetings,

     Some years back, no I have not looked it up how long ago,
     Doc Logger started to write articles for FidoNews.  Many of you
     have enjoyed reading them, as I did and it's great to see his writing
     back this week.  Thanks Doc.

     This weeks issue is certainly a bit 'thicker' than the past few weeks
     and it's certainly great to be able to read such fine writings.

     Happy reading,

                               What's Up, Doc?
                         A welcome back to Doc Logger
                                Douglas Myers

     If the rumor mill is correct, this issue of Fidonews should once
     again carry the byline of the long-absent Doc Logger.  I, for one,
     hope it's part of a continuing effort :)

     Doc occupies one of Fido's most important positions.  It's an
     informal position, not spelled out in any policy or FAQ, but it's a
     position which influences Fido as much as any Coordinator or other
     functionary.  Doc is a Fido Character.  You may love what he says or
     hate it, find it amusing or boring, find it significant or
     trivial... but when he's done you know he said it.  He's the kind of
     person you read no matter what he's talking about - enlightenment,
     agreement, debate... these are all byproducts of the character
     development.  Long after his most profound writings have passed from
     your memory, you'll remember the character that is Doc Logger.

     After writing his last article for Fidonews, Doc tried
     unsuccessfully to pass the torch to me.  And, while I've written
     regularly, I always knew I couldn't take on the character which is
     Doc Logger.  I'd pass the torch back, but I'm hoping that Doc
     realizes now that he's been carrying it all along - subdued maybe,
     but only to be rekindled by himself.

     Welcome back, Doc.  I've missed you from these pages.  I think we
     all have.

                           Response to Kay Shapero
                          Questions without Answers
                                Douglas Myers

     Kay was kind enough to send me a copy of her excellent response to
     my editorial last week, making a public "response to a response"
     possible in the same issue.

     KS> ...the sheer volume of argumentative posts...

     There has been a lot of that :)  However, the idea was to see if
     moderators could reach some kind of accord on the "tough issues,"
     and what better place than the MODERATOR conference.  There were
     only about five of us discussing it originally, and we certainly
     could have found a quieter place away from the dissention... but
     then we would have defeated ourselves in that "accords" without
     including dissenters is kinds meaningless.

     And, in all fairness, many of the argumentative posts originally
     spun off the these discussions...


     ---- from last week's editorial ----
       1.  A moderator is the final authority in his own echo.
       2.  A BBS sysop is the final authority on his own BBS.
       The problem is that these principles can be conflicting...
     ------------------------------------

     KS> I'd treat it as one of those "your freedom to swing your fist
     KS> ends at my nose" circumstances.  A moderator cannot force a BBS
     KS> sysop to carry his/her echo and a BBS sysop cannot force a
     KS> moderator to send the sysop that echo.

     I'd agree that there are limits to freedom, but I don't think that
     JUST respecting these limits is sufficient here.  Echomail is a
     cooperative exercise, generally agreed to be to everyone's benefit.
     Like any cooperative exercise, it's going to require people to do
     something they wouldn't normally want to do and which they normally
     couldn't be forced to do.  Just ask any sysop who has stayed up late
     working out mailer problems... :)

     In a sense, a BBS sysop CAN force a moderator to send him his echo.
     The moderator gives up his freedom to control echo distribution
     intimitly when he uses a distribution system.  Back in the "old
     days," it was considered good form to introduce one's self to the
     moderator when picking up an echo, though it's not practiced much
     today.  These days, a sysop sends an impersonal areafix message to
     his uplink's mailer to get connected.  It's convenient, but it
     doesn't require any particular committment on the part of the sysop
     picking up the echo.  Why _should_ he listen to the moderator, who
     may appear to be just an irritant on the echo... especially if the
     FIDONEWS 15-44               Page 4                    2 Nov 1998


     moderator is asking him to do something unpleasant (like restrict
     one of his users)?

     The missing ingredient here is that committment.  We in Fido feel
     that moderated echos are superior to (or at least an alternative to)
     unmoderated newsgroups.  We in Fido generally acknowledge that it is
     sometimes necessary to restrict a participant in an echo.  But do we
     have the committment to back this up?

     Most sysops _will_ cut a user at a moderator's request - even if
     they disagree with the moderator's reasons.  Most sysops will
     restrict the user and then work out the disagreement with the
     moderator outside the echo.  And most sysops will maintain the
     restriction if they can't persuade the moderator, recognizing his
     central authority in this matter.  But "most" is becomming less and
     less... a moderator these days has got to wonder whether he really
     can make a cut.  Will he be working with a sysop who feels the echo
     becomes his once it hits his board?  Will he be working with a sysop
     who's total committment to the echo was to areafix it for one of his
     users, and just doesn't want to be bothered by a demand thinly
     disguised as a polite request?

     I had thought, when introducing these accords, that moderator's, as
     a group, should send this message to the sysops:  we expect you to
     back us up, even if it comes to restricting one of your users.


     ---- from last week's editorial ----
       Should the moderator seek feed cuts at increasingly higher
       levels to maintain his authority, knowing that a feed cut beyond
       the original BBS is likely to cut his echo to many of his other
       participants?
     ------------------------------------

     KS> I'd call that a judgement call on the part of the moderator.  If
     KS> it's really that serious, there are probably ways to route around
     KS> the problem system.  I would say that the moderator has the right
     KS> to request a cut at any level, but would be wise to rethink things
     KS> if the problem persisted up to the region level.

     Agreed.  And again, I think that MOST moderators show extremenly
     good judgement here.  Most moderators will work with a feed to
     minimize disruption.  Most moderators will back down if the issue is
     small and the consequences are great.  And most moderators will show
     this good judgement at the front end, only requesting the original
     access restriction if there's no other way to work things out.
     But "most" can be overshadowed by that occasional moderator who MUST
     have his feed cut despite consequences to other nodes and despite
     the difficulties a feed might have in implementing such.  Some
     moderators lose sight of the fact that only their original access
     restriction is reasonable, and that the sysops they are approaching
     have a vested interest in echomail too.

     KS> However, any sysop who does not agree with the moderator's action
     KS> has the right to discuss it with the moderator in netmail.

     FIDONEWS 15-44               Page 5                    2 Nov 1998


     And moderators should treat that discussion with respect.  The sysop
     should be as interested in the health of echomail as the moderator.

     Well, I'd say one of your problems is that the sheer volume of
     argumentative posts to appear on MODERATOR lately has pretty much
     made it impossible to actually *read* everything in the echo if
     you have any pretense to an off-line life...  Certainly I never
     saw any reference to the survey, and I doubt I'm the only one.

     OK, as a moderator my response to the following is:


      TM>     1.  A moderator is the final authority in his own echo.
      TM>     2.  A BBS sysop is the final authority on his own BBS.
      TM>
      TM>     The problem is that these principles can be conflicting
      TM>without some kind of consensus between the moderators and the
      TM>sysops.

     I'd treat it as one of those "your freedom to swing your fist ends at
     my nose" circumstances.  A moderator cannot force a BBS sysop to
     carry his/her echo and a BBS sysop cannot force a moderator to send
     the sysop that echo.

      TM>     Should the moderator seek feed cuts at increasingly higher
      TM>levels to maintain his authority, knowing that a feed cut beyond
      TM>the original BBS is likely to cut his echo to many of his other
      TM>participants?

     I'd call that a judgement call on the part of the moderator.  If it's
     really that serious, there are probably ways to route around the
     problem system.  I would say that the moderator has the right to
     request a cut at any level, but would be wise to rethink things
     if the problem persisted up to the region level.

     There is no point in the sysop trying to "second guess" the
     moderator any more than there is any point in the moderator
     telling the sysop how to organize his/her bbs.  However,
     any sysop who does not agree with the moderator's
     action has the right to discuss it with the moderator in netmail.

                             Say NO to Feed Cuts
                                Gordon Lewicky
     FIDONEWS 15-44               Page 7                    2 Nov 1998


                                  1:153/307

     This article is extracted from an echomail message to Steve Stacher
     originally appearing in the area MODERATOR.
                                   --------

      SS> So how does a Moderator remove an unruly, obnoxious and
      SS> disruptive user?

     By removing the user's posts, and not by removing all those innocent
     other users from the system. Just because they belong to a bbs
     whose sysop is a echo twit, does this mean they are all guilty by
     association?

     That is what all of you are saying who insist that feed cuts
     should be made. What we need to do, is work on a way to cul the
     twit user's posts from the echo in the uplink packets. Plain and
     simple. It's what I've been advocating all along. Remove the
     poster, NOT the feed!

     This is strictly my opinion, but I truly believe that anyone who
     is adamant about having feed cuts, is solely operating on an
     egotistical and childish basis, has no concern what so ever
     about all the other users in their echo, and simply wants to be
     the bully on the block who stands on the other side of the street,
     sticking his tongue out at the twit sysop, saying "Nyah, nyah.
     I showed you!"

     We, all of us, moderators and sysops, should be striving to make
     it easy for all of us to remove the twit's posts!! That is the
     only decent solution, and we just remove their posts, not hundreds
     of others!

     Maybe that bbs is the only one in the area. Maybe that echo gives
     some poor shutin their only pleasure for the day! Removing that
     twit sysop's feed just destroys the happiness of a total innocent!

     Hey moderators... feel free to not think about all the others if
     your only intention is to throw weight around and stroke your ego.

     I dunno if this is coming across correctly, but I am totally
     opposed to we, as Fido, allowing any one person the power to feed
     cut, and especially not allow that power to reside in a
     moderator's hands!

     When you get right down to it, feed cuts are just ego trips,
     and when you enter Fido you should park your ego at the door! :)

     I know ego's are rampant, sysops and moderators both, but someday,
     I would like to see a totally mature bunch of people in Fido
     with socially conscious views towards all the users. We are mostly
     this, but there are a few children out there!

     Feed cuts only hurt users.

     I look after my users. My bbs wouldn't exist without them. Fido
     FIDONEWS 15-44               Page 8                    2 Nov 1998


     doesn't exist without them. It is up to all of us, sysops and
     moderators both, to do our damnedest to look after our users!

     I will always look out for them and fight any ego tripper!

     Sorry, I can never lighten up on this subject, as long as there
     are ego trippers out there who don't care about users. :)

     Somebody has to care about the little guy! Somebody has to care
     about the people whose only link to the world is through Fido,
     because they can't afford it any other way! Spending all what little
     money they have on drugs and nursing support, medical bills! Using
     donated 286's with 2400 modems.

     Their only bright spot in the day is a reply in an echo!!

     All you moderators who have asked for feed cuts, ever think
     about them? Or are you just trying to exert power?

     Come on moderators... be truthful... look deep inside you and say
     that you honestly considered the little guy when you demanded
     a feed cut!

     I think not!

     Am I making this up? Not on your life!! I have a few users in this
     situation and Fido IS one of their few happinesses! I'm sure
     you'll find quite a few Fido BBSes with users like this, if not
     the majority of Fido bbses!

     If moderators won't or don't care about them, I WILL AND DO!

     Heheh.. I'm surprised EC's and hubs aren't jumping on me, as most
     of what I'm advocating only affects them and increases their
     workload! ;) But that's what programs are for. No big deal to have
     a twit remover program sitting inbetween receive and toss! :)

     A program made available to all nodes with downlinks, and one
     that also sends twit reports to their uplink, which carries on up,
     collecting all the other twit reports and ending up in the NEC's
     and REC's systems, so all is out in the open, with the resultant
     report file made available by freq'ing the appropriate EC's.

     Then we all could see the twits in every net, within our region,
     and the regions could see the zone. Makes sense to me.

     Poof... bad poster not posting! Moderator happy!

     Poof... mail still moves! Sysop happy!

     Poof... bad posters are known, in case they try to jump
             nets, regions, zones! Bad poster unhappy!

     Poof... person typing with a pencil in their mouth, or using
             speech software, still receives their mail! Estatic!

              New Nodelist Features Full Internet Capability

     In a stunning display of technological derring-do, the Fidonet
     Technological Standards Committee (FTSC) has adopted a new nodelist
     format for all zones.  This new nodelist offers the capability, for
     the first time, for internet-only and dialup nodes to co-exist on
     the same nodelist as peers, with full connection information
     contained in the PHONE field and an entire new set of flags.

     In part, this nodelist format was made possible by a ruling of the
     United States Federal Judiciary against Microsoft Corporation's
     dominance of the worldwide computer software market.  As pennance
     for their past abuses of software innovation, Microsoft is required
     to accept connection from their toll-free number to the Microsoft
     Network by Fidonet nodes throughout the world wishing to send to
     internet-only nodes, and further required to crash messages from the
     internet to dial up nodes.

     Nodediff's for the new nodelist will be distributed along with a
     small file which can execute on any platform and modifies all
     mailer, tosser, and compiler programs it finds to be compatible with
     the new format.  This same program also cleans up any Year 2000
     incompatibilities in any program, and is capable of patching
     hardware problems.

     Reaction to the new format is entirely favorable, judging from these
     reviews by various principals:

     "Sure, it'll cost a few billion, but it's a small price to pay for
     world-wide domination."   - Mr. Gates of Microsoft

     "I have reviewed the recommendations of the FTSC, and all appears to
     be in order."    - Mr. Satti of Fidonet

     "We almost got hung up on the code to make Dutchie operating under
     Windows NT compatible with the new scheme, but the rest was a piece
     of cake."   - An anonymous developer for the FTSC
