     =================================================================
                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================


          Much to my surprise I received a message from Thom Henderson
     a few weeks ago. It wasn't that he had sent the message that took
     me so  much by surprise as the message's contents. He was looking
     for a new editor for FidoNews and was "offering" me the position.

          Let me say up front that it took me several  days to finally
     come to  a decision.  It wasn't  an easy  decision to  make! As a
     semi-regular columnist I had  it  easy.  If  I  didn't  feel like
     writing or  didn't have  the time  it was no big deal, although I
     did have to live with the guilt it  caused (and  yes, I  did feel
     guilty when  I didn't get a column out). As editor it would be my
     responsibility to the net to make sure that an issue  of FidoNews
     did go  out every  week, regardless  of what my work schedule was
     like or my personal feelings. Only after I was sure  I could take
     on the  responsibility did  I check  to make  sure I could do the
     work required. This may sound backward but I  was reasonably sure
     that if  I decided to shoulder the responsibility, I could manage
     the work. In the end, I decided that it was "the right thing."

          For the  time  being  there  shouldn't  be  any  real change
     apparent  to  most  of  you.  I  am  continuing  Thom's policy of
     printing  anything  I  receive  (outside  of  obvious plagiarism,
     libel, or  criminal intent).  I am  going to  try and take a more
     active role in getting material. Many of you will be hearing from
     me in  the near future in this regard! What kind of articles am I
     interested in? Well first off, I'd like to see someone take up my
     old "Regular Irregular Column." Actually, I'd like to see a large
     group of "contributing editors" spring up in the near future. All
     the title  means as far as I'm concerned is that the person makes
     regular contributions to FidoNews. Not weekly.  Not monthly. Just
     regularly.

          Also, right  now there  are many  new bulletin board systems
     being introduced to the net. I'd like to  see some  articles from
     these "converted"  sysops and their users on what they expect and
     see  in  FidoNet.  What  made   them   decide   to   add  FidoNet
     compatibility to their systems, and how easy (or hard) was it for
     them to learn some of our unique terminology and practices.

          Some other topics I'd like to see articles on in  the future
     are Gateways. What are they? How do they work? At FidoCon I heard
     some of the possible uses of  EchoMail, is  anyone doing anything
     new and  exciting? Tell us about it if you are. There are several
     public   service   EchoMail   conferences,   are   they  actually
     accomplishing anything?  Also, what is the EchoMail backbone? How
     do you "link up" with it. Some of these are  questions that every
     sysop asks at one time or another, and it would be a big asset if
     everyone could point to and read  a good  article on  topics like
     these.

          If you  think you'd  like to  write something but are unsure
     FidoNews 5-01                Page 2                    4 Jan 1988


     how it would be received, drop me a line and we'll discuss it. In
     addition to  my electronic  address (which is now a public board,
     no more routing worries) I'm listing  my home  and work addresses
     and phone  numbers. I'm  also interested  in hearing  from you on
     topics for articles you'd  like to  see. Who  knows, maybe  I can
     find someone to write them!

          In summary,  I'd like  to say  that I  am very excited about
     this  new  position  and  hope  that  I  can  live  up   to  your
     expectations. I  plan on  taking a more active role than Thom did
     in that I'm going to be  a little  aggressive in  getting some of
     you  to  write  an  article  instead of just posting a message in
     EchoMail. EchoMail is fickle, many people  may not  see a message
     that directly  pertains to them. Why not enter a message AND send
     in an article, after all this is YOUR newsletter!

     Your Editor,

                             Alternet: The End

                              By Aaron Priven

       Before I start, I'd like to say what I liked about the
     AlterNet Policy. Mainly I liked the terminology. As someone who
     named his BBS ("Angevin Empire") after a 12th-century dynasty of
     English kings, I am amused by the idea of being a knight rather
     than a sysop. But I don't think that the major point of
     AlterNet's existence was to be amusing.

       I've only been in FidoNet a short time as a sysop. I didn't
     know the 'good old days' before the IFNA wars. But one of the
     things about the FidoNet I know is the fact that there's only
     one of it. Despite zones and arguments and flames there's still
     only one network, with one simple way of getting information
     from one node to another. That's changed now.

       Now we're going to have two networks. Then the next thing that
     happens is we'll have lots of little networks. Probably we'll
     just give separate zones to the different little networks. All
     those who think that IFNA is the greatest thing we've ever had
     and we need more of it, go to zone 1. All those who hate IFNA
     and everybody in it and would be willing to go in front of the
     House Un-American Activities Committee to denounce them, go to
     zone 9. Everybody who doesn't care about Fidonet as long as
     their BBS is listed so they get national exposure, go to zone
     12. Everybody who is happy as long as they get TECH, COMM, and
     ECPROG, go to zone 120. Everybody who would just as soon collect
     stamps, go to zone 1,238,272!.

       Sound like the Bell System break-up to you? Even worse than
     that, because the Bell System break-up was at least
     geographical. These little nets will more than likely be spread
     over all parts of the net, in little bunches. (Making it un-
     Policy3 to give them zone numbers, as POLICY3 has a restriction
     on units not made exclusively for the improvement of
     communications).

       I'm not going to argue here for one sort of action or another,
     whether IFNA should be left alone or reorganized or
     disincorporated. But the net must be kept unified. There are so
     many other forces that may come to bear on us: governmental
     regulation, software incompatibility, telephone abilities, the
     simple problems of growth. We must work together to solve our
     problems -- not fall apart.

       I know we all have our own ideas about what should be done.
     But whatever is done we must do it together.

                           ---------------------

       The message above was directed not so much at the sysops and
     users at large, but rather at the particular sysops who are
     leading factions like 'AlterNet' and 'SoutherNet'. Here is one
     that is addressed at everyone.

       The biggest danger in all this factionalism is not that the
     net will choose the wrong direction, but that the net will break
     up. One way to limit the use of factional nets is not to beat
     them, but to join them. I am considering joining *all* factional
     nets that may arise: AlterNet, SoutherNet, and any other netlets
     that may arise. This is not an ideal solution, by any means, but
     en masse it might limit the use of factionalism.

       I await your thoughts.

     Don Daniels, President
     International FidoNet Association
     1:107/210


     This letter is basically in response to the editorial and article
     that appeared this past week in FidoNews dealing with AlterNet.
     According to these documents a currently unstated number of
     individuals appear to be interested in forming their own network
     beginning early in 1988 as an alternative to...well, that's hard
     to say exactly.

     "FidoNet" is a likely answer, but they seem to be taking most of
     that with them in the sense that FidoNet is in essence a group of
     computer systems that exchange files using the FidoNet protocol.

     It could be that "IFNA" is what they are taking exception to,
     except if we accept the premise, as many of us believe, that IFNA
     is merely the current mechanism for implementing the collective
     will of all concerned sysops regarding the Net, it would seem
     that they are merely attempting to avoid subjection to such
     collective will, which strikes me as being not on the mark.
     Furthermore, several of their number have indicated that they
     maintain respect and support for IFNA and wish to continue their
     current relationships.

     Whether that will be allowed or not by AlterNet itself is also
     hard to say as, at least one of their patrician voices has
     declared that, even if not disallowed, continued dual association
     would be philosophically incompatible.  On the other hand, others
     of their aristocracy have declared that such bi-lateral
     association would not only be allowed but would be desirable.

     To me, the message then is that there is not yet a clear view of
     exactly what AlterNet is and may become.  As such, it would
     appear that the best thing to do for the rest of us is simply
     nothing but wait and see.

     However, a few moves have been made by the two sides.  Ryugen
     Fisher was kind enough to call me and provide an explanation of
     his thoughts and concerns relative to the changeover.  We agreed
     on many points including the point that it would be mutually
     advisable for Ryugen to maintain his seat on the Technical
     Standards Committee, thereby functioning as a liaison with
     AlterNet.  He will also step down from the chairmanship which
     will preclude potential conflicts of interest.

     One of the majors factors which has motivated Ryugen to make his
     choice has been the considerable flaming which has appeared in
     the various EchoCons.  This certainly is one area within which I
     can completely sympathize as I have been appalled at the lack of
     consideration shown by so many of our sysops.  It always struck
     me that such behavior would sooner or later exact a heavy price
     and here we can see one such instance in the alienation and loss
     of a considerable number of concerned sysops who have made and
     probably would have continued to make many valuable contributions
     FidoNews 5-01                Page 6                    4 Jan 1988


     to FidoNet.  I'm certain I personally will feel this loss, which
     seems worse when considered in terms of the petty behavior of
     others which has motivated it.

     I happened to be talking to Tom Jennings this past FidoCon on
     related ideas.  Actually I'm slightly surprised that I've heard
     that he disapproves of this current scheme as he was making the
     point that we shouldn't limit our horizons.  "How do we know," he
     said, "that this is the best way of doing things?  If we're not
     open to trying other approaches we may well miss the solution
     that would prove best in the long run."

     So with that thought in mind we bid farewell to our AlterNetives.
     As they embark and sail across uncharted waters for unknown lands
     in their quest for their particular Holy Grails we wish them
     Godspeed.  Perchance our paths will cross again in another time.

        AUTOECHO is a program that stems from the
     needs of all ECHOMAIL HOST and HUB sysops. It allows
     a NODE to send a message to the HOST system and
     turn on and off ECHO's that he/she would like to
     recieve or not recieve without the intervention of the
     HOST system sysop.

        A message is sent to AUTOECHO with a password
     in the subject field. This password MUST agree with a
     password the HOST system defines in a file called
     AUTOECHO.PWD. The body of the message contains the
     ECHO's the requester wants turned on or off. If the
     ECHO is preceeded by a minus sign the ECHO is turned
     off. If no sign is there the ECHO is turned on.

        AUTOECHO then modifies the HOST systems
     AREAS.BBS or ECHO.CTL file and adds/deletes the ECHO
     being sent to that requestor. It also send a message
     to the requestor informing him/her what action was
     taken.

        All actions taken by AUTOECHO can be redirected
     to a log, AUTOECHO >> AUTOECHO.LOG, so the HOST sysop
     can tell what ECHO has been picked up or deleted.

        AUTOECHO.A93 may be requested from 151/1000 or
     151/100. A .DOC file and examples are included.

        Can you say "AUTOECHO?", I thought you could.

     I have established new echomail conference called CPE. It's
     purpose is to provide a forum for practitioners of computer
     performance measurement and capacity planning. It's main thrust
     is in mid to mainframe size environments, but all are welcome.
     The forum hopefully will provide a place to exchange ideas and
     techniques.

     This echo came about as a result of an informal meeting held
     several weeks ago at the Computer Measurement Group (CMG) annual
     meeting held in Orlando. Better than 25 individuals attended a
     informal meeting to discuss the value of such a conference and a
     number of nodes have already expressed in interest in joining the
     effort.

     If you are interested in joining such a conference, drop me Net-
     Mail to 104/739 and we will get you included.

     107/269     107/169
         ECHOMAIL --  ANOTHER FLUEGELMAN FOR FIDONET ?

     Last year Tom Jennings won the First Annual Andrew
     Fluegelman Award with the "software that started it all" --
     FIDO\_IBM.EXE.

     For THIS year's Award ... how about thanking JEFF RUSH for
     creating ECHOMAIL ? ( We can get him the award first, and
     tar-and-feather him afterward, right? )

     Besides, maybe we OWE Jeff Rush a little more than we do to
     other Network Software Developers.  While ECHOMAIL was
     technically SHAREWARE ($25.00) Jeff Rush acted as if the
     program had been released to the public domain.  Though the
     program itself marked each message with the node number of
     its users, and Jeff read in many of the national ECHOS, he
     never made an issue of the people who used the program and
     "forgot" to pay SHARE.

     This year the competition is going to be stiffer.  More
     people know about the Award -- the prize is  $5,000 -- and
     commercial programs ARE eligible.

     The Award will be made on the merits of the software
     according to these judging criteria:

     **    It advances the state of the art in personal computing
     **    It manifiests innovation in concept and design.
     **    It demonstrates orientation to personal computer
           users.

     If we can generate enough nominations to engage the judges'
     interest, ECHOMAIL is good enough to win !   It has brought
     BBSing as far from the NetMail-only Fido Boards as FidoMail
     brought BBSs from the stand-alone technology.

     What's more,   ECHOMAIL has produced the same kind of
     outpouring of creative  energy that FIDO did ... it has been
     cloned, improved, and has inspired dozens of add-on utilities.
     It has that "spark" that the judges will be looking for.

     SO, let's pass the word through our networks, our echo
     conferences, and among  our friends.  Let's bring home the
     Fluegelman with ECHOMAIL!

     Brief Description:  ECHOMAIL, a SHAREWARE program,  enables
       (sample)          a network of personal computer Bulletin
                         Boards  to support  "newsgroup"  or
     "conference" messaging.  Messages entered by users are
     automatically sent (via ordinary telephone lines) to all
     BBSs participating in  the same ECHOconferences, and may be
     read and replied to by any user in any other BBS.
     Information "known" in one BBS is "known" by all other
     boards ina very short period of time -- often overnight!

     Reason for Nomination:   ECHOMAIL has made much of the
       (sample)               long distance information-sharing
                              power of mainframe networks
     available, via PC's, to amateur operators, non-commerical
     users, small businesses and grass-roots organizatons.  As a
     result, private news services, specialized data bases and
     no-paper, no-postage newsletters are now an economic and
     practical reality.

                          Telecommunications Today


     Some time ago,  a group of particularly bright folks came up with
     the  idea of a standard code of letters,  numbers and punctuation
     symbols so that  different  kinds  of  computers  could  exchange
     information.  The  code assigned numeric values ranging from 0 to
     127 to each character.  The choice of a name  for  the  code  was
     made  by  less-bright  folks,  and  that's  how  ASCII  was  born
     (American Standard Code for Information  Interchange,  pronounced
     AS-kee).

     ASCII  wasn't  the first code devised.  One of the earliest codes
     was called BAUDOT.  It was devised by George Baudot,  whose  name
     lives  on  with  those  who refer to data transfer speeds as baud
     rates instead of  bit  per  second.  After  the  introduction  of
     ASCII,  IBM  even  made up its own code called EBCDIC (pronounced
     EB-sid-ik).   It  stands  for  Extended  Binary   Coded   Decimal
     Interchange  Code,  and  it never really caught on outside of the
     large-scale IBM mainframe world  (probably  because  the  acronym
     they  chose wasn't very snappy).  Even the IBM PC and compatibles
     use what is called a superset or expanded version  of  the  ASCII
     standard.  The  PC's character set contains 256 characters rather
     than ASCII's 128.  Codes 0 to 127  are  identical  to  the  ASCII
     standard,  but  128 to 255 are used for special characters unique
     to   the   IBM   and   compatible   personal   computers.    When
     telecommunicating with non-IBM machines,  IBM computers generally
     use codes 0 to 127 only, which is the normal ASCII set.

                              A BIT OF BINARY

     Let's look at how we use these numeric codes to actually transmit
     information, namely three characters we'll choose at random:

                                  I  B  M

     Not too random, huh?  The ASCII codes for these letters are:

                                  73 66 77

     These numbers are in decimal,  or base  ten  format,  the  number
     system  we humans use in everyday life.  Computers use the binary
     number system.  Binary numbers are in base two format.  The  only
     characters used in base two are ones and zeros.  Each one or zero
     is  called  a bit (Binary digIT).  Bits are easy for computers to
     work with.  Since computers are  electrical  devices,  they  know
     only  whether an individual bit is on (1) or off (0).  The binary
     equivalent of:

                                  73 66 77

     is a series of ones and zeros:

                              I = 73 = 1001001
                              B = 66 = 1000010
                              M = 77 = 1001101
     FidoNews 5-01                Page 12                   4 Jan 1988


     Not only is this format easy for a computer to handle, it is very
     easy to convert into sound and send over telephone  lines.  We'll
     see why a little later on.


                                   PARITY

     We've  seen  how  ASCII  character  codes  can  be represented as
     strings of seven bits.  In the early days of  communications,  it
     was  soon  discovered  that  noise  on  the telephone lines could
     interfere with data  transmission.  People  needed  some  way  to
     verify  that  what  was  being  received  matched  what  had been
     transmitted.  By adding an eighth bit to the  beginning  of  each
     string,  a  crude form of error detection called CHARACTER PARITY
     was created.  This error-checking  is  handled  by  the  software
     running  on both ends of the telecommunications link.  This extra
     bit was named a PARITY BIT,  and it made it possible to use  EVEN
     or ODD parity schemes.  It works like this: with even parity, the
     total  number  or  ones  in any character is always even.  If the
     seven-bit code for an ASCII character has an even number of ones,
     the parity bit is set to zero.  If the  seven-bit  code  for  the
     ASCII character has an odd number of ones,  the parity bit is set
     to one.

         Using even parity,

                      1001001    1000010    1001101

         becomes:

                     11001001   01000010   01001101

     The receiving software then removes or "strips  off"  the  parity
     bit  and works with the remaining seven bits.  If a bit string is
     found to contain an odd number of bits before  stripping,  it  is
     assumed  to  be  an  error and the string was retransmitted.  Odd
     parity works in a similar way,  always requiring an odd count  of
     ones.  But  parity is of little value for most personal computers
     users today.  This type of error-checking dates back to the  days
     when  eletromechanical  devices  such  as teletypes were in heavy
     use.  The gears and cams of these machines were much  more  prone
     to  introducing  errors  than modern equipment.  In fact,  so few
     systems employ parity- checking  schemes  these  days  that  many
     computers  (including  the  IBM-PC)  use  the parity bit for data
     instead of for error-checking.  This allows IBM-PCs to  send  and
     receive  all  256  PC  characters,   rather  than  just  the  128
     characters in the ASCII set.  In this case, there is no parity:

                      1001001    1000010    1001101

         becomes:

                     01001001   01000010   01001101

     We still use eight-bit strings,  but the HIGH BIT (leftmost  bit)
     simply  represents  special  characters  which are mostly special
     FidoNews 5-01                Page 13                   4 Jan 1988


     graphics characters.



                              Just A Bit More

     We're almost ready to ship out our data to the  modem.  The  last
     thing  that needs to be added are FRAMING BITS which indicate the
     beginning and end of each bit string.  They  are  usually  called
     the  START and STOP bits.  A start bit of zero is inserted at the
     beginning of each character,  and a zero stop bit is appended  to
     the end.  Now our message looks like this:

                    01001001    01000010   01001101

         becomes:

                   0010010010  0010000100 0010011010


     Now  we are ready to transmit our data to the modem,  but first a
     simple definition of what the modem function is.  The name  MODEM
     comes  from  two words which describe it's function.  MOdulator -
     DEModulator.  Modems use two sets  of  frequencies  to  send  and
     receive  data.  Just for simplicity's sake,  let's call them high
     and low frequencies.  One modem will send  data  using  the  high
     voice, and listen for data from the modem on the other end in the
     low voice.  The other modem will do just the opposite.  One modem
     is  using  the  assigned frequencies in what we call ANSWER MODE,
     and the other is using ORIGINATE MODE.  If both were in the  same
     mode,  each  modem  would hear both itself and the other modem at
     the same time,  so they wouldn't be able to differentiate between
     what they are sending and receiving.

     Each voice has two octaves, referred to as SPACE and MARK.

         |   MODE      |                |(0) SPACE |(1) MARK  |
         |-------------+----------------+----------+----------|
         |             |                |          |          |
         | ORIGINATE   |   TRANSMITTER  |  1070    |   1270   |
         |     "       |   RECEIVER     |  2025    |   2225   |
         |-------------+----------------+----------+----------|
         |  ANSWER     |   TRANSMITTER  |  2025    |   2225   |
         |     "       |   RECEIVER     |  1070    |   1270   |
         |_____________|________________|__________|__________|

     By  convention,  the  tone associated with the zero-bit is space,
     and the tone for the one-bit is mark.  Also  by  convention,  the
     normal  state of the phone line when no data is being transferred
     is a continuous mark tone,  which can be  considered  a  constant
     stream of ones.

                           SENDING AND RECEIVING

     Finally  we're ready to transmit the data.  Remember,  our modems
     are pretty dumb animals when it comes to data.  All  they  do  is
     FidoNews 5-01                Page 14                   4 Jan 1988


     take the series of ones and zeros passed to them by the computer,
     convert  them  to mark and space tones (MOdulate),  and then turn
     the tones back into ones and zeros at the other end (DEModulate).
     Here we have a "quiet" transmission of all marks  (ones)  waiting
     for some data:

         MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM

     We  are  hunched  over  our  keyboards  happily telecomputing and
     oblivious to everything  happening  inside  our  machine.  If  we
     type:

                 I             B                M

     the ASCII codes for which are:

                073           066              077

     our computer recognizes what we typed as:


             01001001      01000010      01001101

     so out telecommunications software adds the start and stop bits:

            0010010010    0010000100    0010011010

     and  the  data is sent to the modem,  which changes the zeros and
     ones into mark and space tones:

            SSMSSMSSMS    SSMSSSSMSS    SSMSSMMSMS

     which is superimposed over the "quiet" of a solid mark tone:

         MMMSSMSSMSSMSMMMMSSMSSSSMSSMMMMSSMSSMMSMSMMM

     so the receiving modem can change them  back  into  a  stream  of
     zeros and ones again:


         11100100100101111001000010011110010011010111

     The  telecommunications  software  on  the  other end watches the
     incoming stream of ones and zeros from the modem.  By convention,
     the first zero says,  "Hey!  The next eight bits are a  character
     and  the  ninth bit after me will be another zero.  After you see
     that last zero, watch for the start of another character!" So the
     telecommunications program removes the extraneous ones introduced
     by the constant mark tone, as well as the start and stop zeros:

             01001001      01000010       01001101

     which the person on the other end finally sees as:

                 I             B              M

     Seems like a lot  of  trouble  for  three  letters,  doesn't  it?
     Fortunately  it's  all  handled  for  us by software and hardware
     working together.

     (Some of the examples are greatly oversimplified,  and I've  been
     pretty loose with terminology for clarity's sake.)

                             COMMITTEE REPORTS
     =================================================================

     Don Daniels, President
     International FidoNet Association
     FidoNet 1:107/210


              State of IFNA and FidoNet - January 1, 1988


     Rather than ask for status reports from the various committees
     this month, I felt it might be best to talk about some general
     concerns relative to IFNA and FidoNet.

     First of all, I'm pleased to report that, with the assistance of
     Bob Hartman, some real progress has finally been made in both the
     Executive Committee and Board of Directors which not only
     inaugurated their new electronic sessions, but have completed
     their first electronic balloting.  It is particulary pleasing for
     me to report that the first item of official business passed in
     this manner by the Board of Directors was the confirmation of the
     choice of Cincinnati as the site of the 1988 FidoNet Conference,
     August 25-28.  FidoCon chairman Tim Sullivan promises me that
     detailed information will be posted here for you shortly.

     We apologize again for the delay in establishing these sessions,
     but we were faced with quite a number of legal and operational
     difficulties relative to conducting official business via
     Electronic Mail.  First results with the methods implemented seem
     to indicate that we have established not only a working approach,
     but one which may set precedents for other conferences and
     organizations.


     FIDONET - GROWING FAST

     FidoNet itself seems to still be thriving, albeit with certain
     growing pains.  At last count, our NODELIST had approximately
     2400 individual nodes in thirty countries and territories with
     the promise of more on the way.  I've been told that over the
     last six months we have been growing at the rate of 125 new nodes
     per month.  Should that rate continue we could expect to be 3400
     strong by the time we meet in Cincinnati.  (Better book early!)


     IFNA - IT'S TIME

     It's time to take a hard look at just what IFNA is, because it's
     not exactly what many of you have come to believe.  I have been
     "preaching" the following concepts to my fellow board members,
     but have realized that the best way to convince them is to have
     the rest of you out there come to the same basic understanding
     I have - and then let you convince your representatives.

     FidoNews 5-01                Page 18                   4 Jan 1988


     OK, so let's look at one of the things that IFNA is not.  It
     certainly is not an elitist group of a few people bent on taking
     control of FidoNet.  I'll never understand how such an idea ever
     got started way back when, particulary at the very time when the
     then autocratic leaders of FidoNet tried to actually relinquish
     their hold on Net operations in favor of a more democratic
     process.  But to this day there are people who still talk as
     though this is the greatest thing we have to fear.

     To me, as the current head of IFNA, IFNA is not so much an
     organization (although, of course, it has to be incorporated and
     have officers, procedures, and various operating mechanisms) as
     it is the spirit of FidoNet.  That spirit started five years ago
     with Tom Jennings and John Madill and, along the way, infected
     all of the rest of us.  Eventually, the burden of maintaining the
     expanding Net proved too much for TJ to handle and the job of
     overseeing the Net was passed to the guys in St. Louis (and
     others).  Guided by that same spirit of FidoNet, this period saw
     the creation of the Net's operational heirarchy and the
     establishment of the various Coordinator positions to manage it.

     Once again the growth of FidoNet was so great that it became time
     to pass the responsibility, and the spirit, onto another source
     of greater resources and, to this end, IFNA, the organization,
     was conceived and implemented.  I know now, as I talk to the
     various individuals trying to somehow squeeze additional time and
     energy into their efforts for FidoNet, that it is that same
     FidoNet spirit that drives us all in what we try to do in IFNA.

     So how does this work?  You, as individual SysOps, have consented
     to be governed by a chain of Hub/Area/Regional/Zone/International
     Coordinators.  Essentially, each coordinator operates as a sort
     of "dictator" with full responsibility for his domain.  You have
     no direct control over how he operates - the only mechanism you
     have (short of dropping out of his domain) to attempt any control
     over him is to convince his "boss" coordinator (who in many cases
     made the appointment in the first place) that your coordinator is
     not doing the job.  No easy task.  This was the sum total of the
     procedure until IFNA was formed.  When the guys in St. Louis
     decided to form IFNA, one of the primary benefits they saw was
     the establishment of an overseeing body that would be responsible
     to all the Sysops of FidoNet and would manage for them, via the
     International Coordinator, the chains of coordinators.  This
     management involvement was not intended to be on a direct basis
     up and down the chain, hasn't been, and won't be.

     What this primary function of IFNA does do, however, is close the
     loop.  It allows you, the governed SysOp, to have an official say
     in the manner in which your network is administered by the
     various coordinators in the chain.  This say is expressed through
     your direct vote and through the votes of your elected
     representatives.  You charge these representatives to present
     your individual will for the future of FidoNet.  What IFNA is
     then, in essence, is simply the collective will of concerned
     SysOps for the future of FidoNet.

     It's now time that we all really try to put this concept into
     action.  We must give up any "us vs. them" mentality that we
     still maintain and understand that each and every one of us is
     operating with that same driving spirit of FidoNet.  Oh, it may
     drive us in different directions on various topics, but the
     associated controvery should provide us with a synergetic energy,
     if we can all keep our emotions in check and operate on logic.

     Speaking of keeping our emotions in check, one of the changes
     which I have personally effected is to once again subscribe to
     the IFNA EchoCon in order to insure more feedback between you and
     your leadership.  You are invited to use that forum (or send to
     me direct) to ask questions, express your views and enter into
     SERIOUS discussion of the issues facing FidoNet.  But please,
     leave your egos, insults, flame-throwers, and all other
     disruptive forces behind.  FidoNet deserves better than that.

     Each of you has a Divisional Representative to IFNA.
     Additionally, there are eleven other "at-large" directors.  Adopt
     one or two.  Make it clear to each of them that you believe in
     this concept and that this is how you wish to see things operate.
     Establish channels of communication whereby they can learn just
     what your will is on the various concerns confronting us, and you
     can see just what they are trying to accomplish towards your
     interests.  There are many very difficult questions that they
     have to decide in this coming year, but it will be so much easier
     if you provide them with clear-cut declarations of your wishes.
     Try to understand the difficulties that they have in finding the
     various resources to meet their additional responsibilities on
     your behalf and offer to provide whatever you can to assist them.

     (All directors are supposed to meet in St. Louis February 19-21.
     Do you know that for more than one this represents a financial
     hardship?  What can you do about that or other problems they may
     face in trying to meet their responsibility of representing you?)

     FidoNet is growing so fast that we can't hope to even maintain
     the status quo using our present approaches.  Speaking just for
     myself, I know that unrealistic levels of time and energy are
     being expended (if you don't believe me, just ask my wife or
     child - or those of most of the other board members) and yet so
     little of what's required is getting done.  We're going to have
     figure out new ways to provide the resources we need to catch up
     and stay caught up.  In order to even begin to do this it's time
     to stop allowing our knee-jerk responses and really consider the
     implications of some truly tough questions:

       o  What level of involvement in the handling of EchoMail do
          you wish IFNA to take to protect all your interests relative
          to this important but geometrically expanding capability?
          (Don't reply "Hands off" unless you really want IFNA to do
          nothing should the present backbone structure some day
          collapse or some other major problem occur.)

       o  How can we expect to manage this already huge and
          fast-growing operation with part-time volunteers who, as
     FidoNews 5-01                Page 20                   4 Jan 1988


          dedicated SysOps, are already overtaxed in terms of finances
          and time?

       o  Our International brethern, perhaps better accustomed than
          us to dealing with differences, still are coming to us to
          help them with the various problems they face.  How can we
          respond to their needs when we have so much difficulty
          getting our own house in order?

       o  What should we be doing in terms of providing the
          education, liability protection and so many other similar
          services to our membership as required by a non-profit
          charter?  How can we expect to undertake anything like this
          on our miniscule budget?

       o  How should we resolve the various questions concerning the
          place of so many facets of commercialism in a supposedly
          'amateur' Net?  We provide valuable services that, even if
          we could figure out how to charge for them, should still be
          an attractive bargain.  Shouldn't all pay their fair share?

       o  It's time for us, both individually and collectively, to
          answer the question of whether FidoNet really is just a
          hobby or something more.  It's easy to say that this is all
          a hobby when your scope of involvement is passing messages
          between a few systems.  But when you are trying to provide
          the organization and administration for thousands of systems
          in dozens of countries, you quickly realize that to
          accomplish these goals requires more than a hobbyist
          mentality.  Each of us needs to decide what level of
          involvement we are willing to support and then move in that
          direction.  There is no reason that those of us with broader
          aspirations for the future of FidoNet cannot co-exist with
          those content to maintain the status quo.  But it may well
          be necessary for us to restructure our separate approaches
          and operations to make this a reality.

       o  It's also time that we looked at just what "Free" means in
          the term "Free Communication" we use so much.  It means
          "open", "publicly accessible".  It certainly does not mean
          "without cost" because someone, somewhere is picking up far
          more than their fair share.  Just because you may have
          enjoyed certain no-fee services to date does not mean that
          this is some unalienable right.  It means that you should be
          grateful for the gift you've received and should be asking
          yourself how to "repay" it in other ways or areas.  You
          should also be trying to figure out now what you and we are
          going to do when your gracious benefactor(s) no longer can
          afford to meet the ever-increasing demand.

     Two big meetings face the IFNA Board of Directors in 1988: the
     St. Louis meeting in February and the convention in August.
     Many decisions are going to made that affect you and your
     FidoNet.  Please try to meet locally and electronically, calmly
     discuss the various issues to understand the impact of viewpoints
     and needs other than your own, and then express opinions and
     FidoNews 5-01                Page 21                   4 Jan 1988


     suggestions to your representatives to help them enact your will.

     Remember: IFNA is but the collective will of all SysOps concerned
     about the future of FidoNet.

     If that includes you, then support IFNA and your representatives.
     It's your best chance of making sure that FidoNet's growth not
     only won't cause it to collapse under its own weight but will be
     allowed to continue in directions you want.
