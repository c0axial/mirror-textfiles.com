     We have a full Issue for the new year including republishing the
     ARTicle SPECifications for FidoNews submissions in the NOTICES
     section. The only change was the addition of the .INT filetype for
     listing Internet addresses where FidoNet info/ops may be found.

     I discovered quite a few more Internet addresses for FidoNet in
     my surfing last week and got a couple of email contributions to the
     list. Send the info to me anyway you wish [see Masthead] if you want
     your listing in the new section. There were also a couple errors in
     last week's listings. They have been corrected in this Issue.

     There are also some new Canadian contributions to the calendar [Future
     History] section. If you have something for the calendar, send it in.

     The ice has been broken on the .BIO submissions but nothing came in
     for this week's Issue. YooHoo?

     My continued thanks to jim barchuk for running the FidoNews HTML site;
     to Mike Riddle for the flow of .JOK material; Dave Aronson et al for
     the .CMX art in ASCII; and to the ftp sites for carrying the FidoNews
     around the world.

     Let's hope that 1997 will bring us a new International Coordinator, a
     new FidoNet Policy that makes sense for the 21st century, a continued
     spirit of hobby and fun instead of commercial and antagonism, and a
     complete distribution of FidoNews by ALL ZCs/RCs/NCs to their Nodes!

     Anybody know when Chinese New Year begins the Year of the Ox?

     Also be sure to adjust your batch files for the NEW Volume letter of E

     Where Does FIDO Fit?
     by Michael Wilson (1:143/370)

     There has been much talk of the shrinking nodelist.  Many commentators
     believe this is a sign of a shirking FIDOnet.  Many also say that FIDO
     is in cometition with the Internet.  With all these tales of woe, we
     must ask where does FIDO fit in the over scheme of world-wide
     communication.

     FIDO is a hobby.  It consists of a loose federation of sysops, many
     who have BBS systems.  It is apparent that the heyday of independant
     BBS systems located in people's garages, bedrooms and basements is
     gone.  I started my first BBS in 1985.  I have been running this
     current incarnation of THE VILLAGE since 1991.  I used to boast 75-90
     callers per day.  I was forced to get a second phone line to minimize
     busy signals.  I was able to charge for access, and people glady paid.
     Today, however, I am lucky to get fifteen calls per day, and no one
     will charge for access.

     This drop in BBS callers is directly related to the rise of the
     internet.  As more and more people get WEB access, the ANSI world of a
     BBS looses its appeal.  It is difficult to complete against thirty-two
     million color jpegs of Cindy Crawford, and Pamela Lee.  I believe the
     shirnking of the nodelist is directly related to the decreasing number
     of BBS systems.  We must understand that for someone to maintain a
     line in the nodelist, they must dedicate a computer system and phone
     line.  If this "hobby" gets too expensive, then the BBS goes away, and
     the nodelisting goes away.

     Perhaps the nodelist is not the place to look to determine the size of
     FIDO.  When America On-line publishes their numbers, they do not
     publish the quantity of access numbers.  Instead, they publish the
     number of people who regularly interface (through memberships).  We
     really have no idea how large FIDO is from a user stand point, we just
     know how large it is based on access points.

     Also, accessing FIDO is much more difficult than using the Internet.
     If someone wants to use America On-line, MSN, a web browser, or some
     other online service, they simply start the application and dial a
     single number.  No matter where they are, or where they want to go, a
     single access number is all they need to dial.  In FIDO, a user will
     need to dial up systems all over the U.S. or world to get various
     applications, or obtain support for various products.  This is too
     time consuming for the computer user of today.

     I believe FIDO offers a service and has a place today.  The file
     distribution and message distribution are quick and painless.
     However, the Internal, and most email programs are quicker.
     Therefore, I make the following suggestion.  FIDO needs a downloadable
     front-end with address book and look-up capabilities.

     FIDONEWS 14-01               Page 4                    6 Jan 1997


     We need a program that callers can download, and use to dial into a
     FIDO system to get mail and/or files.  If the callers want the normal
     BBS with its doors and such, they can use any comm program.  However,
     if they want quick, easy and painless FIDO access, they can use the
     FIDO front-end.  This front-end will need to auto-update the nodelist
     on the callers local machine, and allow them to maintain an address
     book of favorite sites.

     If we want the FIDOnet to only be sysops, then the nodelist will
     shrink. However, you will see your nodelist grow if we came up with a
     way to increase callers based on the nodelist.  Give people with
     modems a reason to call FIDO boards, and a quick and easy (maybe even
     Windows!) front-end, and FIDO will grow.  FIDO is not dead, it just
     needs a prettier front door.

     *Nodelist Flag Changes Draft Document

     The following is a proposed change to the nodelist.  Please  send
     your  comments  to  either  Ken  Kaplan  at 100/22,  Ray Gwinn at
     109/634,  or David Dodell at 114/15.  We will not be replying  to
     all  comments  but wish to get a general feeling from the network
     about this proposed change.


                        Nodelist Flag Draft Document
                         Primary Author: Ray Gwinn
                       Secondary Author: David Dodell
                    Contact 114/15 or 1/0 with comments
                            Version 1 (11-15-87)


     I proposed that the Nodelist (comment) Flags be replaced  with  a
     capabilities identifier.

     After  all,  the  bottom  line  is  that  we  want  to  know  the
     capabilities of the remote node before it is  contacted.  If  the
     remote  is  not capable of performing the desired function,  then
     there is no need to contact it.

     The problem(s) with the existing method  is  that  it  originally
     started  as  a  comment  field  and  was not planed.  At the time
     SEAdog was the only  "extended  protocol"  program  around.  But,
     along  came  Opus  with a different "extended protocol".  I think
     that additional flags like WZ, BR, WR,  etc is only extending the
     previously  unplanned  system  and  will  lead to problems in the
     future.  For example, XP today includes file update requests, but
     XP a year ago did not.  So,  a node using SEAdog V3.xx will  have
     an  XP  flag  but  it  is not capable of doing update requests (I
     think).  Thus,  XP does not really tell you what the remote  node
     is capable of doing.

     The  capabilities  identifier that I propose will do nothing more
     than define the program(s) that  the  remote  node  is  using  to
     accept  incoming  calls/mail/requests.  Some may say that this is
     nothing more than the product code that  already  exists  in  the
     mail  packet.  The  primary  difference  is that the capabilities
     identifier  will  exist  in  the  nodelist.   This  means  it  is
     available  without contacting the remote node,  while the product
     FIDONEWS 14-01               Page 7                    6 Jan 1997


     code  is  not.   Also  the  product  code  is  limited   to   256
     possibilities.

     I  assume that it is desired that the nodelist flags field be two
     non-control  characters.   If  so,   then  I  propose  that   the
     capabilities  identifier  be  a  two digit,  base 36 number.  The
     digits being 0 through  9  and  A  through  Z  and  are  assigned
     sequentially.  For example, Fido may be 01 and Dutchie may be 02.
     Also note that as defined, XP and WZ are valid.  However, I think
     they  should  be  done  away  with,  and  identifiers be assigned
     starting with 00 (00 meaning generic FTSC net mail protocol).

     This number, once converted to binary, can be used by programmers
     as an index into application specific data bases or  tables.  One
     example   is   a  simple  program  that  will  tell  a  user  the
     capabilities of a remote node.  Given the node's address and  the
     nodelist,  the  program  could  search  the  nodelist  to get the
     capabilities  identifier.   Then  the  program  could  use   that
     identifier   as   an  index  into  a  data  base  to  obtain  the
     capabilities of the remote node and display  them  to  the  user.
     Another  example  is  a program that can use the identifier as an
     index into a capabilities  table  that  allows  determination  in
     advance  that  the remote is capable of the desired session prior
     to contacting it.

                               Implementation
                                 ----------

     First,  all nodes in the  network  are  assigned  a  capabilities
     identifier  of  00.  This  is the capabilities code of a net mail
     program  that  meets  the  basic   requirements   of   the   FTSC
     specification.   Once  again,  the  purpose  of  this  identifier
     (except 00) is to define the program(s) that the node is using to
     process calls/requests/mail.  Also remember that  the  identifier
     reflects  the  mail  handler.  For  example,  TBBS with a BINKLEY
     front end will be identified by its BINKLEY identity.

     The  program  author  (or  project   leader)   will   request   a
     capabilities   identifier   from  the  assigner.   Who  does  the
     assigning is another subject.  Along with the request must  be  a
     written  and detailed description of all enhances features of the
     program.   Remember,  we  are  dealing  with  automated  contacts
     between  nodes.  In  this  context,  the  ability of a program to
     handle 50 simultaneous callers is not an enhanced feature.

     The list of features can be provided to  other  authors  so  that
     they  may  consider  a  compatible  feature.  Note,  that  if the
     description of the enhanced features is not sufficient for  other
     authors  to  add  a  compatible feature,  then the program may be
     assigned the basic 00 capabilities flag.  This little enforcement
     rule  has  the  potential  of  lifting  a  tremendous  burden  of
     documentation  from  the  FTSC.  If  the  committee accepting the
     written definition is programmers, the documentation is likely to
     be understandable.  I think the same committee should assigns new
     capabilities codes (other than those grandfathered).  The ego  of
     the    program   authors   would   probably   insure   sufficient
     FIDONEWS 14-01               Page 8                    6 Jan 1997


     documentation for a capabilities identifier other than 00.

     After  consideration,   the  FTSC  could  choose  to  adopt   the
     definition  (possibly modified) as a standard.  I feel this gives
     the a creative programmer's new features a way into the  nodelist
     and  the  FTSC  the  ability  to consider enhancements with 20/20
     hindsight.  At the same time,  the  FTSC  must  only  modify  the
     provided  documentation  to  define  a  new  standard  instead of
     starting  from  scratch.  But,  I'm  drifting,  this  is  another
     subject.

     If a new revision of the same program has additional capabilities
     that  need  to  be defined,  then the author should request a new
     capabilities code.  There should be a policy that only one or two
     revisions back will have individual capabilities identifiers.  If
     revisions more than one or two old are still in use they  can  be
     assigned the basic 00 identifier.

     The program authors should be required to prominently display the
     capabilities  identifier.  This  will  allow  the Sysop to easily
     provide the identifier to his network coordinator  for  inclusion
     in  the  nodelist.  This  a  basically  a  take off of the ringer
     equivalent code that you find in your modem manual.

     As I have defined it, the committee that assigns the capabilities
     identifiers can not  reject  the  new  features.  They  can  only
     reject  the  documentation  of  the  new  features  as  not being
     understandable.  This should keep most developers  happy  because
     no one can tell them not to do something.  It should make the job
     of  the FTSC simpler because they will only accept documentation,
     not create it.  The  ego's  of  the  developers,  anxious  to  be
     identified in the nodelist, should keep the documentation flowing
     to the FTSC.

     As  pointed out by David Dodell,  the same type of identifier can
     be applied to modems.  That is modem 00 can be a 1200 baud  Hayes
     (true) compatible, type 02 can be a USR Courier, etc.

     What I have proposed here solves many problems, but not all.  For
     example,  there  is  no way to tell when the wierd BBS has SEAdog
     running.  So, a CM type flag is still required.

     I  think  that  3  flags  will  take  care  of  everything.   One
     identifies  the  mail handler,  another identifies his modem type
     and a third  should  identify  when  mail/file  requests  can  be
     accepted.

                              The other flags
                                 ---------

     modem type.

     For example the flag 00 would represent mail can only be received
     during NMH.  Flag 01 would mean mail could be received 24  hours,
     identical  to  the  meaning of the CM flag now.  Other variations

        01 Continuous Mail 24 hour/day
        02 Continuous Mail 24 hour/day with 24 hr File Request Capability
        03 CM 24 hrs/day, File request all but NMH

     The third flag would represent modem types:

        00 300 baud Bell standard
        01 1200 baud Bell standard
        02 2400 baud

     RESYNC, a sealink protocol enhancement by Henk Wevers  2/0
     ==========================================================

     What is resync (recovarable sealink)
     ------------------------------------

     Resync is a protocol enhancement on Sealink by Sea corporation
     that allows the protocol to pickup broken transfers were it was
     interrupted. The coding overhead is very minor because almost all
     routines needed are already part of most sealink implementations.

     As a sideeffect transmissions of exact duplicate files (from whatever
     source) will only result in the two programs exchanging EOT and thus
     saving a lot of transfertime and costs.

     The protocol
     -------------

     The capability of doing ackless sealink
     is signalled by the SENDER by having
     byte  41 (1 based) in block 0 of a sealink file transfer being <> 0.
     Recovery is signalled in the sameway by byte 42 <> 0.

     Recoverable sealink starts off like normal (unrecoverable sealink).
     After the receiver has received block zero without errors the
     receiver checks for a duplicate filename in its incoming file
     directory. When a match is found the time and datestamp are checked
     and when they match the resync procedure is started otherwise`
     the transfer goes on like normal.

     Recovery procedure:

     RECEIVER
     --------

     The receiver sends the following block to the
     sender:

     <sync> <blocknumber> <eot> <crclow> <crchigh>

     sync = $22
     blocknumber: ascii , number of block to resume with, 1 based
     eot = $03
     crc as usual

     The reason this form is choosen is that it is the same block as used
     for passing the filename in sealink based filerequests so the code
     was already there.

     now the receiver waits ontil the line dies (looks for a 1 sec pause)
     then sends $05 and waits for ACK or NAK from the sender. If nak is
     received the recovery procedure is restarted . After a given number
     of failed tries the session is aborted.

     After an ACK the receiver 'seeks' at the given
     block and resumes sealink transfer.


     SENDER
     ------

     The sender has the capability to recognize returning ACK, NAK and
     SYNC. When a SYNC is received the sender stops all output, purges its
     outputbuffers and tries to get the resyncinfo.
     (some smart programming to allow an unintended sync caused by
     linenoise may make the protocol more stable. You may also test for
     ack/nack directly after the SYNC because the ascvii blocknumer
     garantees that a received ack/nak probably means a spurious sync. ).
     As soon as the blocknumber is received the sender acks and resume
     the sealink transfer at the given block.

     NOTES
     ------

     This only works if the receiver closes a partly recived file
     properly, gives it the right name and sets the right time/date.
     In the current dutchie 2.80 implementation it also
     only works for files, not for mailpackets, but that is only a
     question of implementation and choise.

     IMPLEMENTATION
     ---------------

     Currently only dutchie 2.80 implements this enhancement. testing
     has shown that the protocol is very stable and works well.
     Some code in turbo pascal follows to help those who want to

     implement it.

        to the sender. In real implementations this code will be shared
        by the filerequest stuff.

     FSC-0011   by Bob Hartman

     These are some thoughts that I had on FSC001 after implementing things
     in BinkleyTerm.  The state tables I show I believe reflect a little
     bit more of reality than the older tables.  I think that BT
     corresponds to 99% of the stuff that I wrote, and it can talk to
     everything that is out there.  The biggest thing is to be able to
     trick everyone currently in existance into doing what they do best
     without killing someone that can't do all the fancy stuff (ie Fido
     11w).  Let me know if I can be of any help deciphering any of it.  I
     think it is pretty straightforward.  I would prefer if it was not
     published in FSC001 (since that really should not change, except
     perhaps for typos and the EOT stuff mentioned below), but this can be
     an addendum (I'll write something a bit more involved if you want) to
     be given to developers so that they can be most efficient in transfers
     with other systems.  I just put all this stuff in, and looking at the
     time (3:33am) I may have goofed in some places.  Let me know if you
     see anything that looks fishy.  Let me know if you want me to go any
     further with this (I probably will anyway, simply as an example of the
     type of documentation on features that I think would be acceptable in
     the future).

     This note is mentioned:

         Although  the  above  shows  the  sender  emitting only one
         TSYNCH,  it  is recommended  that a timeout of 5-20 seconds should
         initiate another TSYNCH.  The receiver should tolerate multiple
         TSYNCHs.

     In state S4, the phrase "peeked at" means that the character is not
     removed from the buffer.  Therefore when XS1 is started the proper
     character for beginning the Xmodem transfer will be detected.  Notice
     also that XS1 is a change from the XS0 that is given in the original.
     XS0 is for doing Telink, not Xmodem.  Since the first part (the mail
     packet) is sent Xmodem, the proper place to enter is XS1 (I think).

     This next is the current table for Xmodem receiving:

     As I mentioned in the FTSC conference, the delay to eat characters is
     needed in order to purge the extra EOT's that some software sends out.
     The delay can be shorter than 1 second (in practice 2/10ths seems to

     The drawbacks of this one are that it does not take into account the
     possibility of a SEAdog at the other end (or other software) that does
     not wish to do Modem7 filename transfer.  The other end will send a
     "C" instead of the usual NAK, and that should be accounted for:

     If a C is received, it should trigger that the other end does not wish
     to do a Modem7 filename transfer.  Since the data in a Telink header
     block (as well as SEAlink header block) makes the Modem7 filename
     redundant, the sender can return a good filename and slip into Telink
     send with no problem.  Substituting SEAlink send for Telink send is
     also a viable possibility.

     Currently this is the state machine for Modem7 receiver:

     This allows the filename receiver to notice that he has triggered the
     other system into skipping the Modem7 filename stuff.  Once that
     happens, as in the Modem7 sender, the filename can be done away with
     and simple Telink or SEAlink transfer can commence.  Note that once
     again, the byte received is peeked at, so that it can remain in the
     buffer to start the Telink/SEAlink transfer.  Returning fname skipped,
     rather than fname ok signals the other states not to send an

     I found this in my Net travels today, and think this will be
     "invaluable" for anyone who is a system administrator, the resident
     firm computer guru, or outside consultant.  I love the response
     options.  Though it's based in humor, I have to admit I've gotten
     problem reports in real life that were more entertaining/frustrating
     than this one. <g>

     FidoNews Article Submission Guidelines

     FidoNet address 1:1/23

     Updated 29 Dec 1996 by Christopher Baker
     Updated 29 May 1991 by Tom Jennings
     Based on the original work by Thom Henderson

     | denotes a change since the last update |.

     "Fido" and "FidoNet" are registered trademarks of Tom Jennings,
     Box 410923, San Francisco CA 94141, USA and are used with
     permission.

     --------
     SYNOPSIS:

     FidoNews is the newsletter of the FidoNet computer network, its
     Sysops and users.  It is passed to its readers electronically via
     the FidoNet and other computer networks and to non-network
     readers as well.

     This document intends to tell you how to write and submit
     articles for publication in FidoNews. Much of it describes the
     technical specifications which an article must meet in order to
     be included in the newsletter, as well as broad (very) guidelines
     on content. (Of course you realize articles can be submitted only
     electronically.) Please read it carefully. The article you save
     might be your own.


     ------------
     INTRODUCTION:

     FidoNews was originally founded in early 1984 to include all
     parts of the lives of its member Sysops and users, which of
     course means not just technical matters. We do not have fixed
     goals of maximum distribution or maximum readership (i.e. lowest
     common denominator) but only to meet the needs of our individual
     network members. The success of this venture has always been
     contentious at best (ahem).

     In any case the grand experiment continues. Twelve years later
     (at this writing) and over 30,000 Nodes in the network, the
     editorial policy, or lack of one, of FidoNews has shown to
     best fit our ever-changing and unpredictable needs.


     --------------
     SUBJECT MATTER:

     FIDONEWS 14-01               Page 35                   6 Jan 1997


     Articles on any subject of interest to FidoNet members and users
     are welcome and encouraged, not necessarily of a technical
     nature, though priority may be, but not necessarily, given to
     articles of importance to the FidoNet, its technology and its
     uses; other networks such as uucp and the Internet; social
     aspects of communications; ethical issues; other related matters.


     --------------
     ARTICLE LENGTH:

     Try to keep articles short. The longer it is, the less likely
     people are to read it. Consider splitting long articles (more
     than five pages) into smaller articles to be run serially.
     Exceptions will be made at the whim of the editors.

     For practical reasons, we will attempt to keep FidoNews to a
     "reasonable size", which is of course a highly subjective and
     variable thing. As of May 1991, the goal is under 100,000 bytes.
     Decisions regarding content may be made based upon this, though
     in general it shouldn't be an issue.


     ------------------
     WRITING GUIDELINES:

     We are not all professional writers, nor is that even a goal for
     the FidoNews -- we want real communication to and from real
     people; even at the expense of so-called "good writing", which is
     frequently a tool to exclude. There are a few minimum
     requirements though for any successful writing, even for the
     lowly FidoNews:

     * The subject discussed must be clear to people other than the
       author! Don't assume that people will pick up the context from
       your writing. Tell them explicitly.

     * Why are you writing this? It may seem obvious -- "Review of the
       new Acme 75-baud Modem" -- but it's not. Are you the
       manufacturer? An irate customer? Let us know your point of
       view.

     * Who are you? A good question! Anonymity is acceptable, though
       most people want to take credit for their work. Include full
       contact information including electronic mail addresses.

     * Articles submitted via Netmail or email must contain all the
       technically required lines and delimiters in the BODY of the
       message.  This includes the *[title] line and the 70 character
       width requirement. To indicate the filename type for one of
       these message submissions, place the FILENAME.TYP in the Subj:
       line of your email, Netmail, or Echomail. Those that require
       extra editing may be delayed from appearing in FidoNews.

     * Articles will appear when space becomes available, not
       necessarily the "next" issue. If your article is of a time-
     FIDONEWS 14-01               Page 36                   6 Jan 1997


       critical nature, please say so when you submit it; the editor
       still has final say.

     * The editor reserves the right to request changes from an author
       to meet these "standards", which you have to admit are pretty
       loose. It is not the intent for this to be a mechanism to
       refuse articles the editor does not like, but simply to keep
       the contents intelligible.

     * If we have a backlog of articles, we may get fussier about
       things. Historically, this has not been a serious problem.


     ---------------------
     SUBMITTING AN ARTICLE

     TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

     If all that hasn't scared you away, the next step is to create a
     text file which contains the text of your article. The resulting
     file should be sent or uploaded to "Editor", FidoNet
     address 1:1/23. The "physical" location (and phone number) of
     FidoNews varies, and hence must be found elsewhere, such as
     within a recent copy of FidoNews itself.


     Filenames must follow the MSDOS standard:

         FILENAME.TYP

         a 1 to 8 character file name (A - Z, 0 - 9)
         a period,
         a 0 to 3 character file type (A - Z, 0 - 9)


     File types are used to distinguish types of submissions, as
     follows:

         .ART An article, commentary, open letter, or general news
              item.
         .GUE Want to write a Guest Editorial? [*Name & Node on line 1]
         .RET Need to make a Retraction of a previous article or notice?
         .COL Want to become a regular contributor with your own column?
         .ANS Answers to the Question of the Week.
         .BIO FidoNet biographies - tell us your story.
         .HIS FidoNet history - got an anecdote to share?
         .REV Reviews of related product, services, or programs.
         .JOK Net humor in print.
         .CMX Comics in ASCII. [watch those lines at 70 columns!]
         .PRF Want to Proofread? Get a cookie for spotting errors.
         .AD  Advertising FREE services or events.
         .SAL "For Sale"
         .WAN "Wanted"
         .NOT A notice for the back of the issue. Keep them short.
     |   .INT Internet addresses for FidoNet webpages of general interest.|

     FIDONEWS 14-01               Page 37                   6 Jan 1997


     If your file doesn't have one of the above extensions, then it
     will lay around taking up disk space until someone takes a look
     at it and realizes what it is. Maybe.

     The name of the file is up to you, though you should use a name
     which is not likely to be "stepped on" by someone else -- the
     system will not guarantee file names are unique. For example,
     FNEWS.ART is probably not a good name for an article.


     --------------
     CHARACTER SETS:

     The character by character contents of the file itself must meet
     the following standards or it cannot be published in FidoNews.
     The FidoNews staff WILL NOT be responsible for making file
     contents conform to these standards.

     * FLUSH LEFT MARGIN: Please do not put a "left margin" on your
       articles. Have the text start at the very first column.

     * RIGHT MARGIN AT COLUMN 70 OR LESS: Less is tolerable, more is
       definitely not.  If your cursor is resting at column 71 when
       your line is ended, you're okay.  One character past that even
       with trailing spaces and MAKENEWS will barf on your submission.
       If your submission is physically rejected, the Editor will have
       to fix it manually or send it back for reformatting.

     * RAGGED-RIGHT TEXT: Word-Star style "justification" (inserting
       spaces into sentences so that a paragraph is perfectly rec-
       tangular) is extremely hard to read, and consumes needless space.
       Please don't use it!

     * NO FUNNY CHARACTERS: This includes formfeeds, returns without
       linefeeds, linefeeds without returns, tabs and other oddities.
       The only control codes (character codes 0 through 31 decimal)
       allowed are carriage return (CR) and linefeed (LF). The only
       exception is: Control-Z "end of file" terminator characters are
       tolerated. Not required.

     * NO GRAPHICS CHARACTERS: Believe it or not, not everyone in the
       world has an IBM PC. Please restrict yourself to printable
       ASCII characters in the range 20 hex to 7E hex (space to
       tilde).

     * LINES TERMINATED: Each line in the article should be terminated
       with a 'newline' -- either the MSDOS standard (CR/LF) or the
       unix standard (LF only).


     -----------------
     SUBMISSION FORMAT:

     Below is a sample article properly formatted. Features of it are
     discussed further below.

     --article file example begins below this line--
     *A Sample Article [this is in LINE 1 starting at COLUMN 1]

     This is My Title
     by Joe Schmoe, [Netmail/email address]

     And here is my article. Note that it is flush left (zero indent).
     Also note that the right margin is at column seventy so that it
     won't overflow "most" text windows. Each line has a newline. Note
     the *'ed first line. My article will be listed in the table of
     contents exactly as it appears after the * above.

     Figure 1.                       Table 1.
             +-------+               ========
             | A Box |                  Alpha
             +-------+                 Bravo

     Note that we am not using any funny-o characters. This ensures
     that the final article will look the same to every user, no
     matter what sort of hardware he has.

     This is the last sentence of our article.

     --article file example ends above this line--


     The FIRST line of text is the Table of Contents line. It MUST
     begin with an asterisk * as shown above.  NO BLANK lines above
     title line are permitted. If you do not follow this instruction
     exactly, the article will not be listed in the Table of Contents.
     This Table of Contents listing method works for all submission
     file types.

     * Everything that follows the *'ed line will appear in the body
       of the newsletter.  The *'ed line will be stripped out of your
       article text so if you want it repeated as your title in the
       article BE SURE to repeat it on a second line without the *.

     * Next should be the title or name of your article, your name,
       and contact information (network address(es), Postal Service
       address, etc) Try to keep it to one or two lines each.

     * Put a blank line between paragraphs. Paragraphs that all run
       together are very difficult to read, and may be rejected.

     * If you want to put in a table or a figure, go right ahead.
       We do not rearrange text, so your table or figure will
       remain exactly as you entered it. Try to limit them to ones
       that make the communication CLEARER.

     * Don't put a lot of blank space at the top or bottom. The
       FidoNews-generator programs will visually separate articles
       automatically.

     * Please check for basic errors in spelling, grammar, and
       punctuation. We're not publishing a textbook, but you don't
     FIDONEWS 14-01               Page 39                   6 Jan 1997


       want it to embarrass yourself do you?

     * Don't use FidoNews to grind your personal axes against other
       FidoNet members. An article presenting a side of an internal
       dispute is one thing. An article defaming or perseverating over
       several Issues is another. Articles that merely quote endlessly
       from other sources to no particular effect are also not a good
       idea.

     * Don't republish copyrighted material from other sources WITHOUT
       the permission of those sources. Include the permission in such
       articles.

     * Remember that FidoNews is no better or worse than the articles
       submitted to it. If you want FidoNews to be a useful newsletter,
       get involved and submit useful articles. It's up to YOU to make
       it work.

     --------------------
     SUBMISSION DEADLINES:

     FidoNews is published on Monday of every week.  Deadline for file
     submissions to the FidoNews Editor via file-attach is 2300 ET
     [0300 UTC/GMT] the previous Saturday.  Deadline for submissions via
     Netmail, email, or in the FIDONEWS Echo is 2300 ET [0300 UTC/GMT]
     the previous Friday.  Submissions which miss the deadlines will be
     processed the following week.  Submission by deadline is not a
     guarantee of appearance in that week's FidoNews but it is likely
     depending on volume of submissions.

     Latest Greatest Software Versions
     by Peter E. Popovich, 1:363/264

     I think the worst part of playing "catch-up" is having to write "I'm
     sorry for the incredibly long delay in getting back to you." I've had
     to write that a lot lately; it sucks rocks.

     On the other hand, the holidays are finally over, so I've actually
     been able to put an hour or two here and there. It's good to actually
