                               What It Is
                      (a lighter look at Fidonet)

                              by Who it Be

     Hello everyone out there in bulletin board  land!  Welcome  to
     our never-ending search for Truth  (in  whatever  version  you
     like your truth), Justice (if there is in fact  any),  and  of
     course, What it Be! (Noone really knows for sure).


     What is What It Is? It's whatever you think it  is,  actually.
     or more appropriately, whatever you make it out to be. What WE
     think it is, is a column that editorializes specific items  in
     Fidonet that pique our interest, or just plain  piss  us  off.
     Kinda like The Andy Rooney of Fidonews in a  strange  sort  of
     way. A little fun. a little humor (unless that's  been  banned
     by policy recently),  and  a  little  blood-letting  here  and
     there. Nothing too serious now mind you!  I  mean  hey,  after
     all, this column DID make it into the Snooze now didn't it? So
     it can't be all THAT bad!

     If there's a particular cause you'd like us  to  take  up  and
     have a look at, we'll be in touch. We KNOW  who  you  are.  We
     have CALLER ID ...

     This week, we're going to take a look at:

     "The POLICY COMPLAINT"  !!!  And  hopefully,  when  we're  all
     done, we might have a better understanding of  just  "What  It
     Is"...

     When our founding fathers invented Fidonet (You  know,  George
     and Abe and those guys), back in the Nineteenth Century,  They
     laid down the law of the land. Then they sat back  and  waited
     to see how many people would be foolish enough  to  say  "Hey!
     Great idea! I'll join your club, live by your rules,  do  what
     you tell me, and like it". This was Ancient Fidonet.

     Today,  in  Modern  Fidonet,  there  are  thousands  of  these
     people.

     After a while, (After George and Abe and  those  guys  dropped
     carrier and passed on) it was decided that  having  the  rules
     really wasn't good enough. Nope. They needed  a  way  to  NAIL
     those that break them! I mean after all, what good  is  having
     some rules if you don't have a  rule  you  can  use  to  screw
     someone to the wall for breaking the rules?

     FidoNews 7-14                Page 2                    2 Apr 1990


     And so the POLICY COMPLAINT was invented. The  inventors,  for
     lack of anything better to call it, decided that it was  going
     to be called the "policy complaint", and if  you  didn't  LIKE
     it, they'd file one against you.

     So the guys that took over when 'ol George and Abe  and  those
     guys passed on, figured that if there was a way to GET YOU  if
     you broke the rules, then  everyone  would  feel  better,  and
     there wouldn't be any problems.  A  little  INSURANCE  against
     potential violent, maniacal onslaughts so to speak.

     And this was good.

     Years went by, and nobody broke the rules.

     So then it was decided that rules weren't any good  if  nobody
     was going to break them. Furthermore,  there  was  no  way  to
     actually FIELD TEST the Policy Complaint without something  to
     complain ABOUT.

     So they changed the rules.

     They made up a rule  that  said,  "If  your  system  isn't  up
     during Zone Mail Hour, then you have broken the rules. And  by
     the way, this rule has been in effect for a year"

     As soon as it was made known that this new rule  had  been  in
     effect for such a long time, tens of thousands of sysops  went
     scrambling through old logs to find out if they had ever tried
     to  send  a  netmail  during  ZMH  and  couldn't  because  the
     recipient's system wasn't up.  Many  sysops  found  that  THEY
     THEMSELVES weren't up during ZMH at one time  or  another,  to
     their utter horror.

     Once the vicious offenders had been discovered,  the  offended
     asked if they could actually FILE a Policy Complaint.

     Just to see if it really worked.

     So the rule makers said  "This  is  a  democratic  society  we
     live in. Of COURSE you may file  a  Policy  Complaint  against
     anyone you wish,  and  we  will  be  happy,  no,  we  will  be
     OBLIGATED to excommunicate them for you."

     And so it happened. And it worked.

     Today in Modern Fidonet, there are  only  5000  or  so  nodes,
     depending on who's doing the counting and how  many  duplicate
     phone numbers you care to weed through. Only  the  strong  and
     the terminally stupid  survive.  But  be  careful!  There  are
     plenty of "Policy Complaint Snipers" out there!

     FidoNews 7-14                Page 3                    2 Apr 1990


     Yup, the new breed in Modern  Fidonet.  The  Policy  Complaint
     Sniper. Those are the guys who sneak around late at  night  in
     the  bushes  outside  your  house,  armed  with  sophisticated
     electronic listening devices and a  copy  of  Policy  4,  just
     WAITING for you to commit the tiniest infraction. And then, at
     3 O'clock in the morning, when you're out of coffee  and  your
     brain is fried, and you accidentally host route that 800k file
     attach... BANG!! Floodlights snap on all  around  your  house!
     Sirens wail, the Flamers' blowtorches heat up the  night!  The
     800 decibel voice from the bullhorn screams out "This  is  the
     ECHOMAIL POLICE! Give yourself UP! We will not  harm  you,  or
     excommunicate you, Give  yourself  UP!!!  We  have  the  place
     surrounded ..."

     Well, that's how it was, how it came to be,  and  that's  What
     It Is ...

     Next time, we'll  have  an  in-depth  interview  with  a  real
     heavy duty Policy Complainer. Phrank Phutz, the Policy Complaint
     COMMANDO ...

     Don't forget to register to vote.

        I've heard a lot of comments about the news and our press
     in general.  I've also heard a lot of comments about the
     "left-wing" or alternative press.  But one that struck me as
     odd was when someone asked me, "Who needs it?"

        After reading various alternative news echos on the FidoNet
     and other media forms, the best answer I could come up with was
     a series questions:

        Have you heard about the CIA - Savings and Loan scandal
     where the CIA defrauded banks of billions of dollars, adding up
     to $14 billion by some accounts, to be used for illegal covert
     activities forbidden by Congress?  Now the taxpayers are
     footing the bill for that money and the CIA operatives are
     getting off scott-free.  This story was broken by a large
     Houston paper, and extensively reported in the alternative
     press, but for some reason (???) it has yet to be reported in
     the major newspapers or on the "Big 3" television networks.

        I stammered on, you probably thought that the old FBI
     domestic spying programs ended back in the 70s - Did you hear
     about how the FBI is conducting a late-1980s smear campaign
     against Detroit Mayor Coleman Young that was recently
     revealed in court?

        I was gaining speed now and my mind was starting to click
     (well, maybe not click - but it was making some sort of noise).

        How about the invasion of Panama?  While the "standard"
     media was cheerleading the invasion and trying to cover up the
     fact that the "cocaine" found in Manuel Noriega's home was only
     ground corn flour for tortillas, did you hear about former U.S.
     Attorney General Ramsey Clark stating that thousands of
     innocent Panamanian civilians were killed by U.S. forces in the
     attack?  I'd hardly call the former U.S. Attorney General a
     half-cocked radical.

        Or how about the recent hunger strike by the new Panamanian
     president to protest our government's aid policies, or the
     lack of them, to Panama to help rebuild their ravaged country
     destoyed by the economic war and invasion we launched against
     them?  Imagine that, the U.S.-installed president going on a
     hunger strike to protest against the government that installed
     him into power.  I didn't hear a thing about that in the
     normal media.

        I continued on with a couple of more examples, and then
     started in about how the Berlin Wall has fallen but the
     $3 billion U.S.-built concrete wall that divides North and
     South Korea is still standing, but by then I guess he was
     overwhelmed.  All he said was "Thousands died, in the invasion,
     huh?  I heard it was only 200."

        The whole point of this article, if you're starting to
     wonder, is to inform you of some of an alternative news
     echomail conference, called ANEWS, or "News of the US and
     World."

        While ANEWS doesn't have any witty conversation in it or
     talk about the latest adventure game, it routinely carries
     stories, such as the above ones, that are routinely ignored
     by our normal media channels.  While you may or may not agree
     with all of the stories or the points made by these stories,
     you'll be better informed by reading them.

        I once read, years ago, about how the FidoNet was supposed
     to make transmitting little-known information easier and to
     provide an informal yet effective means of doing that.  That's
     what ANEWS is all about - providing people with information
     that our standard media doesn't bother to inform us about.

        Sound interesting?  Like to know more?  Besides ANEWS, which
     is general in nature, there are several good news-type echomail
     conferences in the FidoNet that focus on specific regions on
     the world.

        For more information, check the FidoNet echomail listing put
     out by node 1:1/201 or contact Randy Edwards at node 1:141/552.

        ANEWS - food for thought.

                        BBS World Review Digest(sm)
                        ===========================

     It truly  sadden's  me on this date to announce the demise of the
     DISKazine program BBSWRD(sm).  As of this date there have been no
     subscription request and with programming being what it is today.
     It does not pay Me  or  anyone  else to do something which no one
     desires to see.  So I  have  decided  not  to  continue  with the
     development of the program.

     The  one  or  two  individuals who have  show  interest  will  be
     contacted and provided information on how to continue  to receive
     the only magazine program currently being published by High  Mesa
     Publishing for FREE.

                      Fidocon '90 Information Update
                       Bill Vanglahn 1:1/90@Fidonet

     The Fidocon  '90  Committee continues to work to make this year's
     convention one of  the  best  ever.    We  have  already received
     registrations from as far  away  as  Holland, and as close as our
     own backyard.

     One of our main goals  in planning the event was to allow Fidocon
     to be part of a family  vacation.  New Jersey has a great variety
     of  summertime  activities,  as  well  as the  proximity  of  the
     convention site to New York City.

     We have gotten many requests for family plans,  and  we  are more
     than  happy  to  accommodate!   Therefore, the following plan  is
     added to the Fidocon '90 schedule (Note:  These prices  are  ONLY
     in effect until 5/1/90):

     1)  For  a  participant  and  spouse,  the cost for BOTH will  be
     $620.00.    This  includes  conference    registration   for  the
     registrant, and hotel and meals for both you and your spouse.

     2) For each child attending the conference (accompanied by either
     a plan A or the above spouse plan participant), add $75.00 to the
     cost.  This will include hotel and meals.

     *** Discount Deadline Extended ***

     Because  of  some  confusion,  and problems associated with  "tax
     time", we have extended the deadline for discounted registration.
     Instead  of  the  deadline  being 4/1/90, we are extending it  to
     5/1/90.   Any registrations postmarked by midnight on May 1, 1990
     may register at the discounted rate.

     *** Deposits for Fidocon! ***

     As I  said  before, we are (sometimes painfully) aware that it is
     tax time.   If  you plan to attend the conference, but your funds
     are low right now,  don't fret!  We will accept a $100.00 deposit
     (nonrefundable) toward your registration.   This  will  lock  you
     into the discounted rate, and give  you until July 1, 1990 to pay
     the balance.This, of course, only applies to  plans  A  through F
     and the family plans.

     *** Any ideas? ***

     If you have any ideas on things you  would  like  to see or do at
     the convention, drop us a note at 1/90.   We  WANT  to  hear from
     you!

     A View from the Bridge

     "Captain's Log, Stardate 9003.30"

     When I was a young boy, I used to like to watch Star Trek (I
     still do, though I don't have as much time for it as I used to),
     and I was always impressed with the technological advances they
     demonstrated on the show.  Push a button, and food was instantly
     prepared.  They had little t.v.s that you could carry around
     your neck on a strap.  Other things.  I always wished I was born
     just 100 years into the future to see all these marvelous things
     and grow up in that technologically advanced civilization.  (Of
     course, I also wished that I'd been born 60 years before I was
     to witness the 'exciting times' of the early 20th century.)

     Just the other day, I was using my microwave oven.  As I used
     the touch-sensitive keypad, I reflected on how it wasn't long
     ago that these machines used dials, just like a kitchen timer.
     Then I realized that it wasn't long ago that we didn't even have
     microwave ovens.

     It came to me in a flash that I was born at just the RIGHT time.
     In my short lifetime, I've seen men land on the moon (I still
     have a laquered copy of the NY Daily News issue of that day), a
     president of the United States resign.  I've seen the effects of
     an oil gluttonous nation, and the development of nuclear power.
     I've seen the creation of digital watches, now the norm (and
     driving into Manhatten to buy one for $150.00 that used 24 hour
     time just before I joined the Air Force).  I've witnessed and
     participated in the birth of the personal (it used to be 'home')
     computer, and how its changed, and continues to change, our lives.

     Some things haven't changed too much.  Cars are still cars, they
     don't fly, aren't electric, and still pollute.  The phone,
     though finally starting to show some progress towards its
     potential as an information processing device, is still a phone.
     Even with the advancement of cellular technology, we still don't
     have Dick Tracy "2-way wrist tv's".

     Some things have gotten worse.  The US Space Program is at its
     worst point since the days of Sputnik.  If you have a few
     minutes, please write your congressman, and ask him to vote some
     life into NASA.

     The bottom line, however, is that it appears that I have lived
     the ancient chinese curse.  I truly was born in interesting times!

     Software City --

     I have been fortunate to receive quite a bit of new software of
     late; it's wonderful.  Not the least of which is the new
     release of Opus 1.10.  No, I haven't installed it for real
     yet;  it's pretty obvious that everyone else IS though.  One of
     these days, I'll know so much about it from reading the
     echoes... piece of cake.

     A buddy at the office got a new laptop, and wanted to transfer
     all the files from his old disk onto the laptop's disk.  I had
     purchased Laplink III with that amazing 3 headed cable.  Both
     computers had 100 meg disks.  His E: drive was one giant
     database file, 32 meg.  This file went across in 13 minutes,
     using the Parallel Turbo mode.  Fitting name.

     I got a new protected mode interface TSR from Oracle.  Forget
     the database stuff, ( it's pretty good too ).  I can write
     programs bigger than 640k, I can allocate megabytes of memory,
     and now these programs coexist with expanded memory managers
     and Desqview.


     Home Computing --

     I've also been buying copies of PC Anywhere III.  My clients
     use Carbon Copy 5.  No they aren't compatible.  There are good
     points about each;  I think PC Anywhere is a little faster ( or
     maybe not as slow ).  I still have trouble with HST mode.

     The whole question of remote computing, especially from home,
     is going to boil in the '90s.  There are all kinds of liability
     questions about your being at home and working for your
     employer.  If you get hurt at home while working, whose
     insurance pays?  If you work at home in the morning and then
     drive to work, that's not commuting, or is it?  Does working at
     home qualify you for tax breaks such as home-office
     deductions?  Is this for your employer's convenience?

     Someone always raises two questions :  How do you get your
     voice phone calls?; and how do you interact with your fellow
     employees?.  The first is easy, call forwarding.  The second
     question is a little harder.  We shall see.


     The Snail Box --

     Gawd, I'm sick of junk mail.  I never even look at that
     Neighborhood Shopper flyer.  Do you get that too?  I get offers
     for free credit cards, offers for subscriptions, offers for
     software and hardware.  I can't believe the Post Office has to
     raise rates when they have all this junk mail to work with.

     Actually, I like the offers that include a return envelope; you
     know the kind that's postage paid.  I shove everything back in,
     find some trash to put in too and send it back.  Support your
     local post office.

     I now have the perfect excuse to not pay the bills.  It got
     lost in all the junk mail.

     I hear now about junk-fax. You suppose E-Mail will follow suit ?


     Windfall --

     I recently derided shareware and maybe the gods were reading
     FIDONEWS too.  Low and behold :  a big check arrives in the
     mail.  I wrote this utility call TimeRun which is a TSR and it
     stuffs the keyboard buffer with a user command whenever a
     particular target time has been met.

     I had originally written it back in 1987 for DOS 3.1 and then
     it didn't work for DOS 3.3.  A while back someone asked about
     it, so I reworked it for 3.3 and, well, it was OK again.

     Now some 6 months later, in the mail comes this really big
     check from a technical college in Wisconsin for multiple
     licenses and I'm walking on air around here.  It's that old
     FALSE HOPE coming to get me.

     Anyway, Honey sees the check and those visions of sugar plums
     start dancing.

     "But Honey, don't you remember that hard disk I bought last
     week?"

     "Yes."

     "Well, it's cheaper now."  Slam dunk. <grin>
