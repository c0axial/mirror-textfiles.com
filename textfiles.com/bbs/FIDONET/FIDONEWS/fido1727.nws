                               Let Freedom Ring
                                  Doug Myers

     "There he goes again," the international community will cry in
     despair, "celebrating his own country's parochial holiday in an
     international publication!"  One would think that I'd learned my
     lesson last Christmas when, after I'd confessed to a certain respect
     for the American GI, I was roundly criticized for not holding more
     worldly sentiments.

     Okay... Tomorrow, July 4 of 2000, is Independence Day in the United
     States of America.  It's the 224th anniversary of the day we
     proclaimed ourselves to be an independent nation... and the
     celebration still thrills me.

     To me, it's a celebration of human freedom.  It's not that the
     United States invented freedom, nor even that we're the only people
     in the world to achieve it... but it's nevertheless the day we
     celebrate our country's commitment to human freedom, and we've done
     a tolerable job of sticking to that commitment.

     Before I incur the wrath of the international community again, let
     me point out that a certain pride in my own country doesn't detract
     from the greatness of others.  A celebration of my own freedom
     doesn't deny the freedom people throughout the world enjoy and have
     worked and fought for.

     Let me acknowledge that our sense of freedom was largely inherited
     from the country which held us as a colony prior to Independence
     Day.  in fact, we weren't particularly oppressed when we revolted,
     and our own expressions of freedom ever after were largely modeled
     on the Magna Carta and laws and sentiments of our English
     "oppressors."

     Perhaps we were like errant children who had grown up and had to
     leave the nest to make our own way.  And our own mistakes... it took
     us almost a hundred years to disown the institution of slavery which
     denied the very freedoms we had declared in our nation's birth, and
     almost a hundred more to begin lifting the mantle of second class
     citizenship from the descendants of our former slaves.

     But we did it, and we're still pointed in a direction which
     acknowledges the freedom of each individual... and it's a concept
     which seems to have taken root throughout the world.  It would be
     pretentious to believe that we've caused that, but I'm nonetheless
     proud to be a son of a country which participates in promoting the
     freedom of all individuals.

     To the international community, let me extend an invitation to
     celebrate our Independence Day with us.  I know you've brought your
     own freedom with you, but tomorrow the fireworks are on my country!

                                  THE PACMAN
                              by Andy Manninger
                     (1:106/2000/andym@lightpseed.bc.ca)

     Have you ever sat in front of the monitor wondering what happened to
     the EchoMail messages you were expecting and were sure just had to
     be there, yet were not showing up on your screen? If you have been a
     Fido buff for just a few months, I am sure your answer is in the
     affirmative. We have all become more or less inured to this
     phenomenon. Some glitch develops further up in the distribution
     conduit, somebody's hard disk or modem packs it in, and the message
     stream gets halted right then and there. Eventually the sysop in
     charge stops pulling his hair and fixes the problem, and an
     overwhelming deluge of the backed-up messages suddenly inundates
     you. Like fleas to a dog, it's nothing new to FidoNet aficionados.

     Lately however a much more nefarious phenomenon has raised its ugly
     head with disturbing frequency on FidoNet. I call it the Packman.
     EchoMail messages stop flowing or are reduced to a tiny
     trickle--sometimes for weeks--and the prayed-for deluge never
     materializes. Messages by the hundreds (thousands?) simply get
     gobbled up by the Pacman, never to be seen again.

     I have tried to combat both of the above phenomena by telneting to
     distant BBSes. For over a year now I've been regularly downloading
     EchoMail from two, sometimes three, BBSes that are separated by
     great geographical distances from one another. The strategy works
     most of the time--I think. This technique also gives me a fine
     opportunity to wonder why I'm getting dozens of messages in the echo
     I moderate, ENGLISH_TUTOR, at one BBS, and why I get but a trickle
     or none at another BBS. The missing messages don't show up later.
     Mind you, this phenomenon isn't limited to this one echo. Nor is it
     limited to one BBS. I subscribe to several echoes, and I use several
     BBSes, and most of them suffer the same fate from time to time at
     the tender mercies of the Pacman.

     I'm not technically savvy enough even to guess at the source of the
     problem. Heck, I'm only a humble moderator. But I have experienced
     this problem long enough to know that it's a real one and not the
     figment of my imagination. What I hear from other users confirms my
     experience.

     I can do better than carp only. I can also give credit where credit
     is due. FidoNet mail delivery has speeded up amazingly in recent
     times: I even receive EchoMail before it gets posted (I won't
     belabour the fact that the sender is 12 time zones ahead of me).
     Bravo! So I'm convinced that, the naysayers notwithstanding, Fido
     still has a lot more barks left in him. But we've got to do
     something about the wholesale disappearance of EchoMail messages.

     Somebody, anybody, PLEASE SLAY THE PACMAN!

     Results of the ZC/2 elections
     By Jan Vermeulen, RC/28

     The following message was published in the REGCON.EUR (Zone 2) area
     on Mon 26 June 2000 - it was also sent to all individual RCs in Z2.

         Dear colleagues,

     the proclamation following these words has been sent to the
     candidates and will also be published in REGCON.EUR, ENET.SYSOP and
     FIDONEWS.

     I wish to thank both candidates for running in this election, and
     also David for his assistance as a Verification Officer.

     Jan has run and lost, but there will be another opportunity in about
     two years.

     Ward has my congratulations for winning these elections and on
     behalf of all those who place again their trust in him I welcome him
     back in the seat.

     Finally, I thank those who have bothered to run their referenda and
     have sent in their votes; connections were not always easily
     established and that should be a key subject in the years to come.

     == The Verification Officer's confirmation follows: =================

     I have received copies of the 16 votes cast in the ZC election from
     Jan Vermeulen and have made my own independent calculations. My
     results are as follows:

     Regions who voted:

     21, 23, 24, 25, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 36, 40, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50

     Regions who voted for Ward Dossche:

     21, 23, 24, 25, 28, 29, 30, 32, 40, 47, 48, 49, 50        Total: 13

     Regions who voted for Jan N. Klug

     31, 46                                                    Total: 2

     There was no content in the body of the vote received from Region 36

     and so that vote cannot be included. Therefore the total number of
     valid votes is 15.

     I confirm, therefore, that my results tally with those of Jan
     Vermeulen.

                                SOME THOUGHTS
                                   Part II

     I always wanted to be a procrastinator, never got around to it.

     Dijon vu - the same mustard as before. I am a nutritional
     overachiever.

     My inferiority complex is not as good as yours.

     I am having an out of money experience.

     I plan on living forever.  So far, so good.

     Not afraid of heights - afraid of widths.

     Practice safe eating - always use condiments.

     A day without sunshine is like night.

     I have kleptomania, but when it gets bad, I take something for it.

     If marriage were outlawed, only outlaws would have in-laws.

     Life is an endless struggle full of frustrations and challenges, but
     eventually you find a hair stylist you like.

     You're getting old when you get the same sensation from a rocking
     chair that you once got from a roller coaster.

     One of life's mysteries is how a two-pound box of candy can make a
     woman gain five pounds.

     It's frustrating when you know all the answers, but nobody bothers
     to ask you the questions.

     The real art of conversation is not only to say the right thing at
     the right time, but also to leave unsaid the wrong thing at the
     tempting moment.

     Brain cells come and brain cells go, but fat cells live forever.

     Age doesn't always bring wisdom.  Sometimes age comes alone.

     Life not only begins at forty, it begins to show.

     You don't stop laughing because you grow old, you grow old because
     you stopped laughing

                        Stereotypes and Prejudgements
                            thanks to Lynn Gipson
                             lgipson@netquest.com

     Having her hair done at a West Hempstead, NY, beauty parlor, a woman
     told a cautionary tale about racial prejudice.  The story deserves a
     wider audience.

     On a recent weekend in Atlantic City, the woman related, she won a
     bucketful of quarters at a slot machine.  She took a break from the
     slots for dinner with her husband in the hotel dining room.  But
     first she wanted to stash the quarters in her room.

     "I'll be right back and we'll go to eat," she told her husband and
     she carried the coin-laden bucket to the elevator.

     As she was about to walk into the elevator she noticed two men
     already aboard. Both were black. One of them was big... Very big...
     An intimidating figure. The woman froze. Her first thought was:
     These two are going to rob me. Her next thought was: Don't be a
     bigot, they look like perfectly nice gentlemen, even if one of them
     is awfully black.

     But racial stereotypes are powerful, and fear immobilized her. She
     stood and stared at the two men. She felt anxious, flustered,
     ashamed. She hoped they didn't read her mind but knew they surely
     did; her hesitation about joining them on the elevator was all too
     obvious. Her face burned. She couldn't just stand there, so with a
     mighty effort of will she picked up one foot and stepped forward and
     followed with the other foot and was on the elevator. Avoiding eye
     contact, she turned around stiffly and faced the elevator doors as
     they closed. A second passed, and then another second, and then
     another.

     The elevator didn't move. Panic consumed her. My God, she thought,
     I'm trapped and about to be robbed! Her heart plummeted.
     Perspiration poured from every pore.

     Then one of the men said, "Hit the floor." Instinct told her: Do
     what they tell you. The bucket of quarters flew upwards as she threw
     out her arms and collapsed on the elevator carpet. A shower of coins
     rained down on her.

     Take my money and spare me, she prayed. More seconds passed.

     She heard one of the men say politely, "Ma'am, if you'll just tell
     us what floor you're going to, we'll push the button. "  The one who
     said it had a little trouble getting the words out.  He was trying
     mightily to hold in a belly laugh.

     She lifted her head and looked up at the two men.  They  reached

     down to help her up. Confused, she struggled to her feet.

     "When I told my man here to hit the floor," said one of the men
     (the average sized one), "I meant that he should hit the elevator
     button for our floor.  I didn't mean for you to hit the floor,
     ma'am.  He spoke genially. He bit his lip.  It was obvious he was
     having a hard time not laughing.

     She thought: My God, what a spectacle I've made of myself.  She was
     too humiliated to speak.  She wanted to blurt out an apology, but
     words failed her.  How do you apologize to two perfectly respectable
     gentlemen for behaving as though they were robbing you?  She didn't
     know.

     The 3 of them gathered up the strewn quarters and refilled her
     bucket. When the elevator arrived at her floor they insisted on
     walking her to her room. She seemed a little unsteady on her feet,
     and they were afraid she might not make it down the corridor.  At
     her door they bid her a good evening.

     As she slipped into her room she could hear them laughing while they
     walked back to the elevator.  The woman brushed herself off. She
     pulled herself together and went downstairs for dinner with her
     husband.

     The next morning flowers were delivered to her room - a dozen roses.
     Attached to EACH rose was a crisp one hundred dollar bill.  The card
     said:
             "Thanks for the best laugh we've had in years."
      It was signed,

     A blonde's car breaks down on the highway one day. So she eases it
     over onto the shoulder of the road..

     She carefully steps out of the car and opens the trunk. Out jump two
     men in trench coats who walk to the rear of the vehicle where they
     stand facing oncoming traffic and begin opening their coats and
     exposing their nude bodies to approaching drivers..

     Not surprisingly, one of the worst pileups in history of this
     highway occurs. It's not very long before a police car shows up. The
     cop, clearly enraged, runs toward the blonde of the disabled vehicle
     yelling, "What the hell is going on here?"

     "My car broke down," says the lady, calmly..

     "Well, what are these perverts doing here by the road?!" asks the
     cop..

     "Those are my emergency flashers!" she replied.

     firstlast@osirusoft.com will automatically route to the
     appropriate individual's email.  Anyone in this list will
     also receive routed notice of this feature.  In my case, it
     would still be joejared@osirusoft.com, but you get the idea.

     Also, as information is provided to me, I will be adding a
     latency field to each node, which is defined as the maximum
     time between when the message is received, and when it is
     sent on to other nodes, or available to be sent onward,
     defined in minutes. A latency of ! implies that there is an
     immediate response, and an attempt to deliver immediately
