The venusian centipedes are at it again


SORRY WRONG ADDRESS: I never thought much about the amount of FidoNet
mail that gets lost. That is, until I got the address zone 1 net 1 node
1 (1:1/1) as a side effect of FidoSnooze editorshipnesshood.

Every day, I receive from one to a dozen messages addressed incorrectly.
Sometimes even echomail tosses. While it's definitely annoying to me,
I'm sure it's more annoying to the to/from addressees, and secondarily
to the program authors, who probably get blamed for the misdelivery,
regardless of fault.

Doesn't anyone look in their log files to see where mail gets delivered?

I used to try to return it, but I've long since given up. I simply K)ill
them. Some are obviously repeated attempts at delivery. I'd go crazy
trying to deliver all this mail! Most were generated using one
particular program, which if it isn't fixed soon I'll embarrass by
mentioning by name here.

A new year, huh. I can tell cuz the calendar ran out of months.

"FIDOBILL" - The Accounting and Billing Program for FidoNet Accountants
By Craig Steiner, Programmer [1:104/332]

While some people disagree over whether or not charging for backbone
echo feeds is appropriate, more and more Fidonet networks are using a
co-op type of system to handle the cost of importing echos.  No, you
don't have to pay to become a part of Fidonet but it only seems
reasonable that if someone is paying the phone bill to import echos
into your network that each person who is benefiting should help share
the cost.

So the next question is "How do we keep track of everyone's payments,
etc?"

A program which I have just finished, "FIDOBILL," makes the whole
process automated.  From keeping track of each nodes balance, payment
history, echo charge, billing frequency, to balancing all the deposits
against the bank's written statement, FIDOBILL will make the task of
the net accountant or treasurer much easier.

FIDOBILL keeps detailed files on each member of the network.  Whenever
the treasurer receives payment from a node he enters the information
quickly into FIDOBILL.  A payment receipt is automatically sent to the
node via netmail and the node's files are appropriately updated.  At
user-defined times the software automatically bills those nodes that
need to be billed, sending the statements (bills) as netmail messages
to each node.

When it comes time for the treasurer to actually deposit a number of
payments in the net's bank account an easy-to-use feature accounts for
the deposit in the bank account files, for later reconciliation against
the bank's statement.

Reports can be added to the program that produce detailed information
about the current financial status of the network.  These reports,
along with bank statements, can be automatically netmailed to other
nodes (perhaps the net's NC) at pre-defined times.   Again, this
can provide an additional layer of accountability by having a third
party receive the bank statements and compare them to the bank
statement generated by FIDOBILL on the accountant's system.

FIDOBILL has been used successfully in Denver (1:104) since October
of 1991.  The net's accountant, Eric Smith (1:104/513), has seen his
job become a MUCH easier task since switching to FIDOBILL from his
previous approach to billing (barring the terrors of alpha-testing
and debugging! <g>).  The reaction to the new billing system by
members within the net seems basically positive--the only negative
input coming when some bugs were still being found.  I'll let Eric,
treasurer of the Denver-area network, sum it up himself:

FidoNews 9-01                  Page 3                       6 Jan 1992


   "For years I have strugglled with a Lotus 123 spreadsheet to
    keep track of our Net billing for echomail.  Each month I had
    to manually go through the nodelist to see who was dropped and
    who was added.  This process took several hours a month.  Not
    only was it time consuming, but it took a lot of memory.  It was
    not long before my spreadsheet was too large to work in my one
    meg of memory and I had to buy more RAM.

    Now with this FIDOBILL program it is all automated. Each month it
    adds or deletes nodes, while maintaining their record permanently.
    All I do now is record payments when recieved and make adjustments
    for what a node should be charged a month.  I no longer even have
    to send out a message stating that I recieved payment, this too is
    done automatically when I record a payment.  For those nodes that
    are new to the system it attaches a special welcome message that
    explains the process so that the node knows why and for what they
    are being billed.

    Craig I love it and am happy to tell the world.  Thank You VERY
    MUCH."

    -- Eric Smith, Treasurer Net 104 Co-Op [1:104/513.0]

FIDOBILL is requestable via node 1:104/332 (HST/V32/V42/bis) under the
magic name of "FIDOBILL."  I encourage all net treasurer's and
accountant's to request this program and try it.  I think you'll find
it to be a very worthwhile program that will make your job tremendously
easier.

People with disabilities help each other via network
by Bill Freeman 1:3602/24

Disability Law Foundation, Inc.

People with disabilities often face barriers in the real world, but
together they are breaking down both electronic and real world barriers
and have formed a "network" of, by and for people with disabilities.

ADAnet, which stands for Association of Disabled Americans Network,
was formed by the Disability Law Foundation of Birmingham in an
effort to unify and unite people with disabilities. At this writing
the network has 65 affiliates and extends to 27 states, Ontario,
Quebec and British Columbia. We are looking for affiliates both at
home and in other countries which share our interest in information
that is useful to people with disabilities.
FidoNews 9-01                  Page 4                       6 Jan 1992


To be an ADAnet node, you only have to have an interest in
disability and help to provide people with information that can really
make a difference in all our lives.

We are trying to help establish new disability-related echos such as
Post Polio and Employment, as well as Advocacy and Special Education,
while at the same time making existing resources available across
network boundaries. We are making these resources available to
non-Fido systems as an authorized gateway to the world.

If you'd like more information regarding ADAnet, please file request
the magic name ADANET from 1:3602/24, or dowload the file from our
bulletin board system at the numbers listed below.

We are very interested in new resources to make available to our
affiliates. If you have an interest in disability, or have developed
a resource for people with disabilities, please drop us a line.

I have appended the text of the Birmingham News article that has been
printed all over the United States (it was distributed by API).

COMPUTER NETWORK FOR DISABLED SERVES AS 'WINDOW TO THE WORLD'

by Lori Chandler
News Staff Writer

The Birmingham News
November 18, 1991

Since age 17, when he was diagnosed with a rare neurological
disorder, George Tracy began preparing for a life vastly different
from what he had known.

Now at age 30, Tracy's legs have weakened to where he will soon spend
much of his time in a wheelchair. He is on disability from work and
spends much of his time at home. But he doesn't idly watch
television.  He communicates with others via computer on the
Disability Law Foundation's international computer network for people
with disabilities.

"It's my window to the world," Tracy said. "I do it for a hobby. It
does my heart a world of good to know that there is a wealth of
information out there for us. We're here to serve people."

The fooundation, based in Birmingham, serves as an informational
"bulletin board" for disabled people and those who work with or have
an interest in issues affecting the disabled, said Bill Freeman,
foundation director. It is the only national-international network
dedicated to the needs of disabled people.

FidoNews 9-01                  Page 5                       6 Jan 1992


"We just want to help disabled people in general," said Freeman, who
has mild cerebral palsy. "It's something no one else is doing, and
there is a great level of commitment to it."

Freeman said the network serves people in about 20 states and has
affiliates in Canada - Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia. The
network is supported completely by volunteers, such as Tracy, their
computer equipment and a large computer system maintained by the
foundation. The service is free to interested people; however, phone
calls to the service are not, Freeman said.

More than 1000 people in Alabama use the service, and thousands more
nationwide, Freeman said.

Freeman, a lawyer, began his service after a friend gave him an
article exploring why more disabled people aren't in law school. It
made him realize that there were many disabled people who didn't have
the opportunity to communicate with the outside world, and doors were
closed to them.

"I was upset," he said. "I just felt this needed to be fixed. This
(the network) won't get more disabled people in law school, but it
will help them get the information they need."

The service caught on quickly, and now there are 40 regional networks
where poeople with the necessary equipment - a computer, a modem and
communications software - can tap into, send and receive messages and
information, or access information on subjects that affect or interest
the disabled or of general interest.

The service has had some unexpected subscribers, thanks to the federal
Americans with Disabilities Act, which changes the way disabled people
are to be hired and accomodated in the job setting.  Businesses have
been tapping into the network for information on the act, including
how to comply with it and reading parts of the official regulations
stored in the computer from the Federal Register, Freeman said. The
act goes into effect next year.

"This is a whole new ballgame," Freeman said. It'll be a major civil
rights issue, and it's good for Birmingham to help take part in the
awareness and sensitivity of this issue. We're becoming part of the
disability advocacy movement."

For those who can pay it, there is a $25 yearly subscription fee,
Freeman said.

"Many disabled people are on fixed incomes," Freeman said. "But we
need any kind of support we can get from anyone. A lot of this is
coming out of our own pockets."

Although many organizations exist nationwide to help disabled people
get used computer equipment for use in their homes, there is no
service of that kind in Jefferson County, Freeman said. He siad he
hopes to work with businesses to help provide used computers that
would be appropriate for use with a bulletin board service.

Plans include publishing an electronic newsletter, Freeman said.

Topics available on the service include disability, disability law,
independent living, mobility impairment, learning disabilities,
philosophy of disability, job accomodation network, medical, epilepsy,
spinal injury, chronic pain, DataTalk (for visually-impaired people),
SilentTalk (for the hearing impaired), Employment of the Disabled,
cerebral palsy, AIDS/HIV, retardation, substance abuse, Alzheimers,
amputee, anxiety, cancer, multiple sclerosis, personality disorder,
optometry, public psychology, terminal illness, brain injury, rare
diseases, disabled athletes, dwarfism, home-office management, nurses
network, golden years (geriatric disability), arthritis, disabled
children, respiratory difficulties and occupational disability.

FidoCon '92 -- "Gateway Networking"
Zone 1 Region Coordinators
Zone 1 Zone Coordinator

FidoCon, a celebration of FidoNet History and Tradition, continues.

The FidoNet Zone 1 Region Coordinators (RCs) invite you to submit
proposals to sponsor and host the Zone 1 FidoCon '92.  A theme of
"Gateway Networking" has been chosen for the event.  Please submit
your individual or Net proposal to any Zone 1 RC before February 9,
1992. A committee of Zone 1 RCs will select a primary and backup site
from proposals submitted. Please contact any Zone 1 RC for
information and assistance with your proposal.

In the interest of the attendees, to promote a learning environment
and help to insure participation, we have chosen the theme of
Gateway Networking for the '92 Fidocon.  In today's environment,
sysops are confronted with a bewildering array of domains, zones,
private and point networks.  In addition, several usable commercial
networks are successfully interfacing with Fidonet.  The options for
hardware integration with Lans, Wans and other interfaces have never
been greater.  To promote a better understanding of all these options
for the Fidonet sysop, we would be pleased to see an agenda which
includes informative seminars on these subjects.

Each year, several excellent proposals are eliminated through the
selection process. 1991 was no exception. Those dormant proposals are
some of the ones we hope you will resubmit for 1992. Let's not let
all that good effort be wasted. We're asking you to "show us what
you've got" so we can evaluate a variety of completed and in-progress
proposals and make a selection without geographic bias.

FidoNews 9-01                  Page 7                       6 Jan 1992


In line with assessing the features and quality of your proposals,
we are looking for visibility in the accounting methods chosen, and
will actively review proposals for budgetary responsibility before,
during and after the event.  In keeping with the evolution of
Fidocon, our responsibility includes the assurance that our ametuer
status not be compromised.

The primary and backup sites of the Zone 1 FidoCon '92 will be
announced in FidoNews on February 16, 1992.

And start thinking about your FidoCon '93 proposal. It's not that
far off.

The UtilNet File Distribution Network
by Jerry Seward


The UtilNet File Distribution Network has been established to
facilitate the rapid proliferation of utilities useful to SysOps and
their users.  Programs such as DSZ, SHEZ, PKware products, LHA, ARJ,
VPIC, QEdit, LIST, 4DOS, etc. are hatched into the network from
1:260/222.  Most of these popular utilities are hatched within 2 days
of their release.  To prevent duplication, all submissions should be
sent to 1:260/222.

Robert K. Jung, author of the ARJ file compression program, has
graciously donated an ARJ security-envelope ID for UtilNet, and
accordingly, all files hatched to UtilNet are in the ARJ format with a
security-envelope. The only exceptions are ARJ security envelopes that
are already placed on the archives directly by the program author, and
self-extracting archives of other file compression utilities.

Numerous FidoNet nodes in the USA, Canada, and the UK are already
participating in this new FDN.  Nodes in other zones are invited to
participate.  If you're interested in getting a feed,  I can be
contacted as follows:

Renumbering of FidoNet BBS *.MSG files revisited.
By  Fred Niemczenia  1:371/7  30:30101/7

FidoNews 9-01                  Page 8                       6 Jan 1992


Keywords:

RENUMBER  FIDONET  *.MSG  FILES  C  FRONT DOOR  SIMPLEX


Purpose:

The purpose of this article is to open discussion on an efficient
routine for re-numbering *.MSG files as used in a number of FidoNet BBS
programs.  I've sent messages to a number of authors, but have yet to
receive a meaningful reply.  What I'm looking for is suggestions and
techniques in improving the algorithm listed in Appendix A.   The
intent is to incorporate an efficient model in a yet unfinished utility
to interface the Simplex BBS with the Front Door mailer.  Since no
known utility exists for this combination, my project is to write a
freeware interface.   [Note:  An interim utility `NoFlo' will convert
most EchoMail and some NetMail Simplex traffic from BinkleyTerm to
Front Door format.]

My first attempt was to process files with string manipulation.  I
found that this was extremely slow due to both parsing and ASCII
collating requirements.  I noticed that since the filespecs are
essentially numerical data, it would probably be more efficient to
convert these to unsigned integer format and sort and process them in
that format; a substantial speed improvement was noticed.

At this point I feel that what I have accomplished is probably adequate
for processing the single Front Door NetMail (file attach) directory.
My results on a 10 MHz 286 with a slow K-Lok 30 Meg drive and 400
messages were 2 minutes and 6 seconds.  I suspect that my barrier is
the DOS directory structure, although I welcome comments, suggestions,
and other techniques.  Front Door users will note that the renumbering
of messages without a TosScan program can be accessed from the internal
editor with ALT B.

Appendices A and B sample contain routines for those wishing to get
involved.  Appendix A is the RNUM C segment I've been working with.  A
sub-directory file manipulation example is welcome, although I wish to
avoid any direct FAT manipulation routines as were used in an older
Opus effort.  Who knows what versions of DOS are in use?   Appendix B
is a quick and dirty *.msg file generator.  It is in Interpreter BASIC
since I saw no reason in wasting time with a compilation.  DOS is the
time limit, not a short routine as it.

Please send comments to  Fred Niemczenia  at  1:371/7  or 30:30101/7.

Who's On Top Of The "Top Down" Structure?

Dennis McClain-Furmanski, 1:275/42


POLICY: n. 1. If you're a *C, it's that document you argued over
for years so that you could pretend you had a set of rules to
hide your arbitrary decision behind.  2. If you're a sysop, it's
what I damn well tell you it is, regardless of what you think you
read somewhere, because I'm in charge and you're nothing. Go buy
your own dictionary and look it up. Somewhere between "police
state" and "politburo".

In the midst of the explosive growth of this network, it became
necessary to organize it with a set of guidelines. Given the
rambunctious nature of most of those involved, it was bound to
take some fancy footwork by some leadership oriented individuals.

And so was born that fearsome and powerful entity, POLICY.

But now, when the very nature of this hobby as a hobby is under
attack by the phone companies, and we need more cohesion than
ever before, we find that the policy is no policy at all, and
that the man behind the curtain is no more lawful a member of the
Emerald City than is the Wicked Witch. In allowing some people to
ride herd over the renegade nature of the virtual population of
Fidonet, we have only created a higher level of renegade.

The policy agreed upon until now has served its purpose, albeit
in a mediocre fashion. As it turns out, it is not complete. When
problems arise, and they're taken to a higher authority, it seems
to stop at the assigned top of the "top down" structure. And what
happens when this pinnacle of creation fails to serve the needs
of those who created, by refusing to serve? A new order of higher
authority must be recognized. It has in fact existed all along,
but the nature of administration refuses to recognize its
validity. It is the power that created the power we give to our
elected officials, so that they can supposedly work for us and
carry out duties to make our way smooth.

In short, we the citizens of Fidonet are in command. We are
responsible for what happens within the network. And when the
workings fail, instead of hearing a scramble to action, we hear
wails of lament over loss of control and whining about the
meany-bad-nasties who do us dirty.

It is time to stop refusing to do our duty as the ultimate
authority of our hobby. Too many occurrences of arbitrary rule
making, blatant policy ignoring, and outright abuse of delegated
authority have come to light.

FidoNews 9-01                  Page 12                      6 Jan 1992


If you plan to let amateur politicians take what was supposed to
be a hobby for you, and turn it into a self-serving crusade of
egomania for themselves, that's fine. But I'm not. And has
already been seen around the network, many others aren't either.

A new and independent backbone for echomail is under
construction. Why? No tolerance for bad management for
managements own sake. Disgust with superfluous and needlessly
restrictive pronouncements from self-installed pillars. Threats
and actual occurrences of involuntary changes in status of some
of the systems which make up the real Fidonet. And the publicity
of the unmitigated gall to intercept mail and pirate entire
backbone echoes. These and more, although even these are more
than enough reason.

If things are so bad that sysops are moving to perform those
tasks which the network is supposed to be created to do, because
the administration of the network itself is so wrapped up in its
own glory that it's creating more problems than it solves, then
it's way past time to rectify the problems. As much as I applaud
and support those making the efforts to create a better system,
I'm afraid I feel that they too are somewhat to blame. They are
not fixing anything, but only circumventing some of the problems.

No, the time has come to change Fidonet back to its intended
purpose. Even the name of it bespeaks this. It is Fido NET, as in
network. It is not Fidohierarchy.

Some background of circumstances which led to my decision to act:

Several systems in Guantanamo Bay Cuba, at the naval base, wished
to join Fidonet. Not knowing exactly how to go about it, they
contacted both the Zone Coordinator for Zone 4, and the NC of net
275.

The first makes sense it seems. But the second even more so given
their situation. Gitmo Bay is a navy base belonging to the US,
built on the island of Cuba. But all of the phones at Gitmo Bay
are connected directly to Norfolk Naval base, home of the
Atlantic Fleet, and part of net 275. Gitmo Bay is a local call
for net 275, thanks to the leased lines the navy uses.

As far as geography, Gitmo is as far from Cuba as was East and
West Berlin before the wall came down. This is not a geographical
boundary. It is a political barrier.

Since two requests were made, unbeknownst to the receivers of
them, two offers were made. As is usual in all organizations, the
smaller portion responded quicker. The systems in Gitmo were
given node numbers in net 275.

FidoNews 9-01                  Page 13                      6 Jan 1992


Soon following were political upheavals and accusations of
mismanagement toward the NC of 275. It seems that the person
responsible for handing out node numbers was not to hand out node
numbers without approval from above, regardless of the written
policy.

Now, I can understand that the confusion of multiple requests
caused some confusion. And I can understand that human nature
being what it is, it even caused some spurts of territorial
adrenalin. But it seems to have gone as far as to create in the
minds of the upper echelons the idea that they are capable of
legislating territory at a level above national political
boundaries. The most recent missive from Z1C states that these
nodes are not to be allowed in net 275. Geographical boundries as
recognized by policy are generally arranged around local calling
areas. Not only is the remainder of Cuba not within reach of
Gitmo, I propose the following experiment to test the validity of
the concept of barrier. Lets have the Z1C take a plane into
Gitmo, and the Z4C (the other defendant in this case, though I
truly know very little of his attitude other than our pronounced
ruling intimates that he was involved in the decision) down to
mainland Cuba. Then let's have them attempt to shake hands across
the fence between the two. Given my experience in the military,
I'd say it'd be even money whether it was an AK-47 or an M-16
that sounded first, but I'd give 5 to 1 that it'd be an M-16
bullet that'd hit first.

Still, you can see some recognition of the boundary concept. It
serves a purpose. Or it did until it was shattered by another
happening here.

In the events and communications surrounding a recent NC
election, several members of net 275 became extremely
disenfranchised with some things. What they are exactly really is
insignificant. The main idea is that after a great deal of saying
and doing, communications broke down and became irreparable.
Since they felt there was no solution to be found in the local
net, it fell to those folk who were displeased with things to
seek their mail connections elsewhere, or leave Fidonet. They
opted for the former.

Considering the state of affairs, it was probably the best
solution. A nearby net, long distance, although within 30 miles
of the farthest flung system in net 275, took in those who
preferred to leave. Even though it violated geographical
boundaries, this decision help quiet the airwaves and return the
local area to relative peace. Even though feelings were still
raw, I think nobody here would disagree that the decision made
here by NC 271 was the best to be made at the time. Anything else
would have perpetuated the fight. A new net formation wold not
have worked here, as it had in the recent New jersey territory
disputes. These systems are pretty evenly interspersed throughout
the area.

FidoNews 9-01                  Page 14                      6 Jan 1992


Had things stayed there, all would have been cozy. But after the
systems that opted to move had completed their journey by being
included in the nodelist as net 271 nodes, things didn't stop.
Still more systems entered Fidonet for the first time, and were
awarded node numbers in net 271. Now, solving a no-win dilemma is
one thing, but taking in systems not even applying to Fidonet
until after the settlement is another. Since the decision to move
these nodes, fifteen more have applied to that net, and been
given node numbers there, twice the number of nodes that left
over the dispute. Of these fifteen, exactly zero first applied to
net 275.

Complaints were filed. Nothing happened except more systems in
the 275 calling area added to net 271's list. Policy complaints
were forwarded up the chain. No response. Forwarded farther,
still no response. Crashmail complaints were sent to both RC 13
and Z1C, and records kept of the mail transfers. Finally, after
many weeks of trying to work within the accepted structure, the
decision came from RC 13.

Geographical boundaries were not allowed as arguments in this
dispute.

Say what? Policy is arbitrarily circumscribed by a decision from
the person that policy states is in place only to compile the
nodelist segments from the individual nets?

In both of these cases, which on the first level indicate an
completely arbitrary disregard for the operation of the net by
its members, there's something deeper at work. By allowing such
behavior to interrupt our hobby and our lives, and not taking
control of the situation, we were at fault. We let those whom we
chose to work for us tell us what to do, and we let them get away
with it.

It now ceases.

Regarding the case of Guantanamo Bay Cuba:

In response to the recent message which stated that they were not
to be in our nodelist, the answer is

                                NO!

We have decided that their address will change. They will no
longer be listed as Norfolk_VA. They will now be listed as
GUANTANAMO_BAY_CUBA, in full caps and proudly in net 275. This is
based on realistic assessment of communications capabilities,
citizenship of the country that owns the land the systems in
Guantanamo Bay Naval Base stands upon, and most importantly by
the wishes of those actually involved - the members of net 275,
including those in Cuba.

FidoNews 9-01                  Page 15                      6 Jan 1992


Any attempt to change this ruling will be seen as excessively
annoying behavior by a member of another net, and grounds for
their excommunication from Fidonet.

Regarding the case of Net 275 / Net 271 crossovers:

In response to the recent message from RC 13, disallowing
geographical boundaries as argument, the answer is

                            NO!

We have decided that since there is an obvious geographical
distinction as well as a local calling area already set by C&P
telephone, all systems that apply for node numbers shall apply in
their local calling area. RC 13 is hereby instructed to not allow
nodelist submissions from any net containing nodes from any other
net's local calling area.

Any attempt to allow more systems in the Southside Tidewater Area
of Virginia to be awarded node numbers in the Penninsula Area
will be construed as excessively annoying behavior. The job of
the RC 13 is to compile the nodelist and urge independents to
form or join local nets. It is utterly outside any power of the
RC to allow nodes to cross net boundaries. It is infringement on
the prescribed power of the NC to do so. In the cases of those
that left during the dispute, they are welcome to stay or return
as they wish. This is done at the decision of those involved -
the members of the local net. No other authority to make
decisions regarding locality is recognized.

Any attempt to change this ruling will be seen as excessively
annoying behavior by a member of another net, and grounds for
their excommunication from Fidonet.

Both of these decisions are made based on local calling area as
the basis for connectivity, on the basis of the economics of cost
recovery for echomail being brought in for those within the local
calling area, and most importantly on the basis of the decision
itself, made by those directly involved and from here on out, the
recognized ultimate authority in operation of Fidonet; the
sysops.

There is a time-honored concept in Fidonet. "If you don't like
it, vote with your feet".

There is now a new concept. If we don't like it, we will vote
with YOUR feet. We will simply move you out of our minds as
people who can make pronouncements against our will. And this we
do. You have some duties to perform. Do them, and leave our
operations to us. You don't have permission to interfere.

FidoNews 9-01                  Page 16                      6 Jan 1992


It would behoove you, who hold positions of responsibility, to
recognize the fact that you are outvoted. One *C doesn't outvote
those below. The *C works for those below and performs the duties
necessary to make their way smooth. Anything else is unacceptable
behavior.

It would also behoove you to recognize that you've been
overstepping your bounds so much so often that Fidonet is
rewiring itself around you, at the level where the true power
lies - the individual sysop. Pretty soon you'll have very little
to do except focus on your political masturbations and relentless
bickering, because the targets of your presumed power will have
tired of your excessively annoying administrations. We will not
have dropped out of Fidonet, because we have no reason to. We
will have dropped YOU from Fidonet, because you are more trouble
than you're worth.

We will still be Fidonet for one simple reason. We ARE Fidonet.

TransForMation - Import/Export/Translation Utility

by Kevin O'Malley - FidoNet 1:228/4

Changing communication software? Now you can take your phone numbers
with you! Does a local sysop distribute up to date BBS lists that
you don't use because you would never take the time to enter them by
hand? Now you can import them in seconds to your favorite comm
software!

I am pleased to announce the availability of a new product that
belongs in every modem users toolkit - TransForMation!
TransForMation (TFM) allows fast and easy importing from any fixed
field or comma delimited ascii file to any of 20 different formats
used by the most popular communications software packages. TFM also
allows direct translation to and from any of the supported formats.

The import of ASCII files is facilitated by TFM's unique interactive
template builder. Your source file is displayed on screen and you
simply point out which fields are to be imported. TFM builds a
template which can be saved and recalled for later use. You can build
and use templates to import from any fixed field or comma delimited
file without rearranging the data or "editing in" cryptic control
codes. You can build templates to export records from your comm
software to ASCII as well. Just lay out the arrangement you want and
TFM does the rest.

Direct translation is a snap. TFM scans the current directory and
automatically detects any of the supported format files that are
present. Simply point to the one you want to translate, provide a
target path and filename, and it's done. TFM automatically handles
everything. The user can control settings such as default
communication parameters and the transfer/suppression of passwords.

            Notice:  Invitation to Carry ICDM Net

The International Christian Discipleship Ministries (based in
Washington State in the U.S.) is proud to invite new bulletin
boards to the ICDM Network.  This is a specialized Network.  It
deals with issues such as Liberation Theology, "Missions,"
(dealing with historical missions, and the great evils done in
the name of God), modern Biblical Discipleship, environmentalism
and the disciple, community living, Six Questions, and other
topics that may interest users of subscribing boards.  There is
at this time introductory threads and research on Gnosticism and
Christianity, New Age trends, and other "hot" topics.  The
traffic is light, but, the messages are informed and intense.

The sysop of a board does not have to subscribe to the "creed" of
the ICDM or to that of any participating board.  It is a Network
for the Users of the bulletin board.

FidoNews 9-01                  Page 18                      6 Jan 1992


The ICDM Network is based on the Bible.  But, it deviates from
some of the stereo-type religious expectations and traditions.
Some may call it "mystical christianity."  We call it practicle
discipleship to Jesus Christ.

It is open to any board that is FidoNet compatible.  It is
compiled as a separate Zone (77), so your software must be Zone
aware.  It is open to any faith, any person, regardless of sex,
creed, color, etc. etc.

The HOST is Tomas Hood, 1:352/777, the Zone 77 Co-ordinator.
There may be connections close to you, and as we grow, there will
surely be!  At this time, there are four regions, from
Connecticut to California.

For more information, send netmail to 1:352/777, and request ICDM,
which is an information packet.  We are also listed on OTHERNETS.

Thanks for your interest and we look forward to hearing from you.

Cost recovery (hah!)

On January 4th, I'll be resigning as Net 103`s NEC, so that I can
continue on with life in general, and move to where the industry
dictates, to Silicon valley.  Somewhere a dog will have barked, and my
predecessor will have all of the headaches involved with one of the most
thankless jobs, hubbing.  As a final act of fairness to the new NEC in
this net, I've implemented enforced cost reimbursement in its simplest
form.  Either pay a flat rate and be allowed access to echomail brought
in by the net hub, or don't pay, and receive nothing.  I'm an idealist,
and had some silly notion that if a reliable thruput of mail delivery
existed, and the NEC was visibly helpful, that the net would reciprocate
accordingly.  For future reference for other NEC's, this method was a
TOTAL failure, as basic human tendency is to always want something for
nothing.  Also, if exemptions are allowed for, one will find a high
ammount of people who fit those discriptions.  What the lower link
FidoNews 9-01                  Page 19                      6 Jan 1992


systems never seem to realize, is that echomail distribution is NOT
free.  It costs someone money.  In my case, financially it was
uncomfortable but affordable simply because I had the right place and
rent was cheap.  I could have probably continued to do this for well
into a year, but for my own personal well being I am passing the hat to
someone else, with the best of intentions towards a net that is
self-sufficient.

Excuses excuses excuses...

To be honest, I'm ashamed to admit that I belong to a network of
complainers here.  Among the excuses I've heard are:

"I'm only getting a few echos".

I'd like to know how anyone can justify accounting for echomail on a
echo for echo basis.  On an average, it seems like the average number of
echos is 20-40, with some larger systems picking up as much as 100
echos.  When it's all averaged out, the cost of accounting would
significantly outweigh the cost of charging a toll for backbone
echomail.  I don't believe for a minute that any single node can pickup
even 1 echo with the speed and reliability of a backbone net hub for
less than it costs if everyone contributed.

"Performing other services, why should I pay"

In most cases, the services provided do not benefit the net as a whole.
Nothing compares in cost to distribution of echomail in my opinion, and
distribution of this form of media should be given special attention,
BECAUSE of costs.

"I'm so poor..."

of an excuse for a human being.  Get a life.  If a person can afford a
phone, they surely wont be hurt by a few dollars a month.

"I'm handicapped"

And you can afford new hardware?  This one excuse by a downlink
discusted me to the highest degree, partially because that person
recently spent $1000.00 on 2 USR D/S modems.  Handicapped my arca.

Part of my resignation as an NEC has been for financial reasons, part
for personal reasons, and a large part of this has been because I let
the twits that want a free lunch get to me.  Now that I've walked a
mile in a net hubs shoes, I'll have to give kudos to those who've done
it for much longer, as they have probably one of the roughest jobs in
fidonet.  The real kicker here is that without any connections it barely
takes 30 seconds to process a day's worth of inbound.  For the honor of
hubbing, I traded in 1 hour of processing time for 1 node, and
additional hours of frustration dealing with the problems that arise on
a daily basis on a 4 node system.

FidoNews 9-01                  Page 20                      6 Jan 1992


They forgot quickly how much traffic was improved, and called me a
criminal.  To the ingrates I offer a single finger salute, and it isn't
my pinky.  To the upper 12% you have my undying respect, and came
through
for me during the rough times as best you could.  Thanks.

To those against cost recovery for the net with which you belong:

How is it fair to make one person responsible for your selfish habit?

Echomail costs will increase by at least 30% over the course of this
year, fast approaching an average of 10,000 messages a day, or maybe
it's already approached that by now.  Here we operate pruned to only
what's requested, which is approximately 80% of the number of echos.
In 1989 when I joined fidonet, there were 6000 nodes.  At that time, the
ZEC was operating with a 40 meg system, on a single line.  Today, we're
more than double the size, and consistantly increasing.  If support is
not mandated at the each level, fidonet will collapse under the weight
of
itself.  With proper support, selection processes can be a technical
issue rather than a financial one.  Ok, this is a personal feeling about
cost recovery.  At some point, those not implementing cost recovery will
feel exactly what is going on in this net.  As my NC said to me when I
took over, 'Have feathers like a duck' when it's implemented, and trust
that I wont envy you when it's implemented for your net.

             Random Responses/Rebuttals to FNEWS 852
                         by Daniel Tobias
                           (1:380/7.0)

= To Jack Decker (1:154/8.0):

Do you really mean to deny free use of your program to EVERYONE who is
involved in selling or receiving profit from the sale of computer
software?  This would include all computer professionals, including
professional programmers, consultants, anyone else who works for a
computer software company, not to mention even a sales clerk at a
store that sells computer software (including Toys 'R' Us).
That probably encompasses a large portion of the potential users of
your program.  Only a computer hobbyist whose profession is completely
unrelated to computers (and whose is, in this highly computerized
age?) would be free of the "taint" of programming for profit.


= To Fredric L. Rice (1:102/901.0):

I understand your need to be vigilant about the content of messages
sent via the FCC-regulated ham bands.  It is unfortunate that this
leads to the need for automated censorship.  As a Libertarian, I
believe such content-specific FCC regulations ought to be repealed as
unconstitutional invasions of free speech.  Until then, it is an
unfortunate fact that sysops and hams are compelled to practice
censorship to avoid trouble with the authorities.

= To Jack Decker, again:

I think you doth protest too much.  Why is it that, in today's
society, every group from Christians to homosexuals feels it must get
militant and start up a frantic series of protests at every slight,
real or imagined?  This attitude is behind both the leftists'
"political correctness" and the rightists' militant fundamentalism.
Some people just can't tolerate the existence of others who don't take
their ideas as seriously as they themselves do.  Lighten up a little.
Nobody is denying you the right to believe in and practice your
religion.  However, nobody has given you the right to insist that
others grant any special deference to your religion, either.  Those
who don't share your religious beliefs might well regard some of these
beliefs as irrational superstitions, and they have as much right to
this opinion as you have to yours, and you have no right to silence
them or compel them to write their criticisms in "religiously correct"
language.

As to the claim that pornography causes sex crime, this causal
connection is much too tenuous and doubtful to form the basis of a
massive, forcible, crusade.  It is just as rational a conclusion to
suggest that pornography might prevent sex crime by offering potential
sex criminals a legal outlet for their urges.  Of course, no
statistics can possibly be made of the number of would-be sex
criminals who were deterred from it by the availability of porn, so
nothing can ever be proved one way or another on this.  The fact that
most sex offenders DO read pornography no more proves causation than
does the fact that most juvenile delinquents drink milk prove that
milk causes delinquency.  Frederic Wertham's 1950s book "Seduction Of
The Innocent" tried to make the case against comic books using the
same flawed reasoning, and was responsible for the rigid censorship of
the Comics Code that cramped the artistic growth of this medium for
decades.

And as for "anti-porn" being the law, I could just as validly state
that the present supreme law, the Constitution, states that "Congress
shall make no law restricting the freedom of speech, or of the press."
No exception is made for sex-related publications.  If anti-porn
crusaders want the government to be able to suppress speech they
dislike in this area, THEY should be the ones who have to go through
the effort of amending the Constitution.

On the copyright issue:  This is a valid point, and one that affects
GIF pictures of Mickey Mouse just as much as it does Playboy
centerfolds.  Copyright violations in computer graphics (or music, for
that matter) haven't been as vigorously pursued to date than in
computer software itself, but that doesn't make it right to "pirate"
such material.  Perhaps sysops should consider being more careful
about the origins of graphic screens on their systems, with regard to
copyright and trademark status.  This, however, has absolutely nothing
to do with "pornographic" content; I think Disney is more vigorous in
enforcing its copyrights than is any porn producer.

= To Billy Cash III (1:226/70.0):

As I said, I'm no lawyer, so I have no idea if what you wrote was
actually actionable.   I just thought it exceeded the limits of fair
debate, and could conceivably prompt a lawsuit, even though it might
be a suit without merit.  Thus, a sysop like you who likes to pat
himself in the back about how clean his system is and how remote is
the possibility of any sort of legal action ever being taken against
it might not be well-advised to take the risk of saying something
objectionable like that.

I also find it curious that you attack Rice for "hiding" the fact that
he has "adult" materials on his board, when in fact he broadcast that
fact via a FidoNews article.  Actually, I don't think he, and other
such sysops, are hiding a thing; they simply find it necessary to
limit access to such files to people of legal age due to the
possibility of legal trouble if they don't.  They're not pretending
their system is "clean" (if you regard "adult" material as "dirty").
If you don't like that sort of thing, don't use their system, but
don't act like they are somehow hypocrites for "hiding" the "obscene"
content of their systems.  They are doing no such thing.
