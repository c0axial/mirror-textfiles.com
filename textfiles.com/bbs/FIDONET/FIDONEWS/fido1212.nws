    A short issue today with only three articles.

    Our election in Region 12 is over, and a new RC has been
elected for another year.  Now that the euphoria of finding
someone new is done with, I suppose it is time to get down to
flaming him several times per week.  Such a chore ...

    Here is the snooze.

Echomail to SYSOP
By Ed Gavin
   1:267/161

I've been reading the FN_SYSOP & SYSOP areas lately without it
being flagged to my attention on a daily basis like some others
out there in Echoland. Never to be outdone by other nets, the
Fido Sysops have created yet another means of irritating
ourselves. The not-so-origional originator of our latest screen
sport of under skin crawling, Alan Boritz took the opportunity
to let a portion of Fido-world know that their BBS software
wasn't working as he intended.

Since messaging to SYSOP is not an entirely new phenom in
Echoland it is hard to blame/credit Alan for the sole creation
of the sport. But like Ruth to baseball Boritz has raised the
level of the sport out of the cornfields and into our very
lives. Unfortunately 1995 doesn't look promising for either.

Our very own Sultan of Swat deserves recognition for his record
before it just becomes another passing fad or just another
sinking feeling in the annals of net history. In order to
enshrine our heros we must recognize their contributions and
what better way than to name the sport after them. The
originators of junk mail never got the recognition  they
deserved, the first spammers are long forgotten, let us never
forget Alan's first posts to SYSOP.

By consensus we may decide an appropriate name we can recognize
the talents of our very own! I'd propose we all remember Alan
with a catchy nickname for his sport, something like, "Boritzing
the Sysop" or "Boritzing- Behavior" before the tradition fades
away with the "Boritz Bug-Fix"!

Boritzing my way through the inbound.

Ed

WEIRDNEWS Conference Available

by David Brien
Sysop, 1:107/725

The WEIRDNEWS Conference contains strange but true facts, like:

   Mankind makes up 0.00000000000000000000013 percent of all
   the earth's living things.

and news items, such as:

   In Kalama, Washington, 83 year old E.C. Boone hit a dog with his
   pickup truck. He stopped, and his 86 year old wife, May Belle, got
   out to see how badly the animal was hurt. According to Police Chief
   Ron Pease, the husband "Looked out the mirror and thought she was
   motioning for him to back up and started to back up. In the meantime,
   she walked behind the truck and he backed over her. She started to
   hollar and scream, then he put the truck in forward and drove over
   her again."

culled from magazines and newswires around the globe by an occasional
author of such collections, Jon Standish. Jon is currently posting
about 20 message a week, each about 2K. This is not a read-only
conference, but it reads like one. Of course, everyone is encouraged
to post responses and new items.

If you think your callers would enjoy reading WEIRDNEWS, why not pick
it up? The conference is available to all by sending a netmail to
SYSOP@1:107/725.

PRO_LIFE conference
-------------------
From: Jon Guidry (1:3803/11.1701)

Hello to all your sysops (and users) out there.  :) There's
always room in FIDOnet for another conference, so I'm launching
a PRO_LIFE conference.

I know some of you might REALLY want this conference, and some
may "blast" me, as the PRO_LIFE issue is a very touchy subject.
As moderator of R_CATHOLIC, I see to it that peaceful discussion
that actually yields some- thing takes place. I don't allow
uncontrolled arguing and "bashing" inside R_CATHOLIC, and won't
allow it in PRO_LIFE.

PRO_LIFE is a conference that anybody concerned about the
Pro-Life move- ment can join. Whether you are Roman Catholic,
Methodist, etc, if you support the cause of life, you are more
than welcome to join this conference.

Alex Mottram @ 1:3803/16 may be contacted for feeds.  If he
doesn't respond right away, feel free to mail him more than
once, as he is very busy.

R_CATHOLIC and PRO_LIFE are also linked to the  Catholic
Information Network, which is hosted by Mike Molleurus at
1:202/1613.

Again, thanks for your support. When I put R_CATHOLIC in the
E-list, and sent in the submission to FIDOSTAT.NA, I really got
support from the REC's.

Thanks!
Jon (1:3803/11.1701)
