     =================================================================


     FidoNet has come a long way since it began over twelve years ago.
     But how far has it come lately?

     There hasn't been any discerible movement toward selecting an
     International Coordinator [IC] from the current field of 6 Zone
     Coordinators [ZC].  Are we ever going to get one and move along in
     the areas of Policy and Standards?

     As our guest editorial indicates, we don't even have regular updates
     from the other Zones for the master Nodelist.  Where are the diffs
     [Nodelist difference files] from Zones 2-6?  Are they getting ours
     from Zone 1?  This still is an INTERNATIONAL hobby, isn't it?

     Are there any reports from the FTSC [FidoNet Technical Standards
     Committee] on the state of our Standards?  Updates to our practices?
     Presumably, software authors are still at it and things have changed
     in the last couple years, yes?

     Hello, out there!  Here's your vehicle for spreading your news.  How
     about some chiming in from the ZCs and FTSC Chair?  What gives?  Talk
     to us!

       NOTE: This Issue contains ALL the new sections available.  Some of
             them may just be dummy files to show their locations and use.
             ARTSPEC.DOC has been updated to include them.  Also see the
             FIDONEWS Echo for details.  All sections will not appear in
             all Issues depending on what is submitted.

     Hello ZC's.

     I am writing as a concerned FidoNet node.  The NodeLists in various
     zones seem to be way out of sync quite often.  The ZSEGS file area
     was set up a few years ago to help move the NodeList info between the
     ZC's. It seems to work well, when used.  But not all of the ZC's seem
     to use it on a regular basis or their links are bad.

     Here is a map of the ZSEGS file area:

     Almost all of the international links are via FTP.  I mention this
     because I'd like to encourage you to send FULL segments, not just the
     diff's.  One missed diff and the game is over.  This isn't a problem
     with segments.  The cost is low enough that sending full segments is
     justified.

     Come on guys, please use it and get our NodeLists in sync!

     Thank you for your consideration.

     Regards,

     John

     ARTSPEC has been adjusted with more submission types and a couple of
     notes.  The new version has been sent to each Zone Coordinator and
     hatched out into COORDUTL and SDS area SOFTDIST.  ARTSPEC is always
     available here [1:1/23 {1:374/14}] by that magicname.

      ***[new]

     * Articles submitted via Netmail or email must contain all the
       technically required lines and delimiters in the BODY of the
       message.  This includes the *[title] line and the 70 character
       width requirement.  Those that require extra editing may be
       delayed from appearing in FidoNews.

      ***

     The following new filetypes are available for submissions:

      ***[additions]

     File types are used to distinguish types of submissions, as
     follows:

         .ART An article, commentary, open letter, or general news
              item.
         .GUE Want to write a Guest Editorial? [*Name & Node on line 1]

         .SAL "For Sale"
         .WAN "Wanted"
         .NOT A notice for the back of the issue. Keep them short.

     If your file doesn't have one of the above extensions, then it
     will lay around taking up disk space until someone takes a look
     at it and realizes what it is. Maybe.

      ***[new]

     * RIGHT MARGIN AT COLUMN 70 OR LESS: Less is tolerable, more is
       definitely not.  If your cursor is resting at column 71 when
       your line is ended, you're okay.  One character past that even
       with trailing spaces and MAKENEWS will barf on your submission.
       If your submission is physically rejected, the Editor will have
       to fix it manually or send it back for reformatting.

     The first line of text is the Table of Contents line. It must
     begin with an asterisk * as shown above. If you do not, the
     article will not be listed in the Table of Contents.  This Table of
     Contents listing method works for all submission file types.

     * Everything that follows the *'ed line will appear in the body
       of the newsletter.  This line will be stripped out of your
       article text so if you want it repeated as your title in the
       article BE SURE to repeat it on a second line without the *.

     SUBMISSION DEADLINES:

     FidoNews is published on Monday of every week.  Deadline for file
     submissions to the FidoNews Editor via file-attach is 2300 ET
     [0300 UTC/GMT] the previous Saturday.  Deadline for submissions via
     Netmail, email, or in the FIDONEWS Echo is 2300 ET [0300 UTC/GMT]
     the previous Friday.  Submissions which miss the deadlines will be
     processed the following week.  Submission by deadline is not a
     guarantee of appearance in that week's FidoNews but it is likely
     depending on the volume of submissions.

      -30-

     1. The Netmail submission requirements are specified to make them
     easier and faster to process.

     2. The additional filetypes are to encourage more participation.
     Please note that the Guest Editorial must be signed.  Use the
     *[title] option to place your Name and Node number on the first line
     of your .GUE.  Anonymous Guest Editorials will not be published.

     3. The line length is 70 characters MAXIMUM.  I don't know where the
     72 came from but this edition of MAKENEWS won't take a line over 70
     characters in length.  Make sure your submission conforms to that
     line length or it won't get published until it gets noticed as
     rejected by MAKENEWS.

     4. It wasn't in the original specs but the *[title] line gets stripped
     out of your submission after being appended to the Table of Contents.
     If you want it to appear in your article, you will need to repeat it
     on another line WITHOUT the *.

     5. FidoNews didn't have submission deadlines before.  These are now
     included for a reference point.

     Subj: R13 nodelist error

      * Forwarded from "HOST18"
      * Originally by Ken Tuley, 1:374/98@fidonet
      * Originally to all
      * Originally dated 13 Jul 1996, 8:53

     A glitch on 1:13/0 resulted in the wiping out of much of Region 13
     from this week's nodelist.

     A corrected regional segment for R13 is available HERE as R13NEW.A94
     or magicname R13FIX, which can be compiled as a private nodelist to
     compensate for the error until the next nodediff comes out.

     Please pass this information on to the members of your nets.  Anyone
     who has direct netmail links to the missing R13 nets is undoubtedly
     getting very frustrated already.  More than half of the nets in that
     region were affected.

     Thanks for your assistance,

     a fix is available.  i just received R13NEW.A94 [102K] which is a
     recompile of the Region 13 ONLY.  it is available here.

     it can be installed on your system as a private Nodelist [following
     whatever requirements your mailer uses for private Nodelist handling]
     and get you back to full R13 access.

     it cannot be substituted into the full Nodelist without compromising
     the CRC for next week's diff addition so if anyone decides to go that
     route, they should keep a clean copy of the original NODELIST.194 they
     FIDONEWS 13-29               Page 7                   15 Jul 1996


     make first to merge with the diff next week.

     it is also available here in ZIP form as R13NEW.ZIP [66K].  magicname
     is R13FIX.

     all of the RCs should have a copy by now and most of the NCs in R13.

     everyone should update to the current Nodelist especially if they
     have a lot of comms with Zones 2 & 4 which has many updates in 194.

     TTFN.

     =================================================================


     Region 13 needs a tweak this week

     Nobody ever said FidoNet or its denizens were perfect.  The vagaries
     of software and hardware and peopleware and luck occasionally
     conspire to aggravate us.  It's not a conspiracy. [grin]

     Region 13 had a MAKENL meltdown this week and several of their Nets
     now appear missing in NODELIST.194.

     While this condition is being corrected for NODELIST.201, a quick-fix
     has been prepared by RC13 in the form of a Region 13 segment that may
     be compiled into your local Nodelist database as a PRIVATE list.

     R13NEW.A94 is now available from all Zone 1 RCs and is hopefully going
     overseas to our fellow Zones before this appears.

     Look for a copy near you and compile it as a private Nodelist [see
     your own mailer configuration docs if you've never done this] in your
     personal Nodelist database.

     DO NOT edit your NODELIST.194 to replace the R13 section UNLESS you
     keep a clean copy of NODELIST.194 to merge with next week's NODEDIFF.
     A locally edited Nodelist WILL NOT merge once the CRC changes with a
     local edit!  Do it as a private list compile to get back access to the
     R13 Nodes.

     You should go ahead and update your Nodelist every week even when
     there are problems.  The local problems usually won't outweigh all the
     corrections and additions you will miss in the newest Nodelist.  This
     week's Nodelist has major adjustments to Zones 2 and 4 listings.

     anything to retract, yet. [grin]

     Still Being Discussed
        by Bob Moravsik (2606/583)

     I see some lively discussions going on about ECROC.  Some
     "imatures" seem to get there ONLY jollys by childish
     semantic permutations of the acronym.  Lets look at an analysis.
     You've all heard about the its my marble game when refering
     to moderators.

     Over and over the tone is one if "its mine mine mine", something
     that reminds me of watching 5 year olds fight over the sand
     in the sand box.  Let's interject some reality.

     A conference is not a thing.  Its mearly a word use to
     describe the collection of messages with the same "echotag".
     Under current Fidonet policy, an echotag is not a protected
     set of characters. ANYONE may author a message with ANY echotag
     and route it to whoever accepts it.  Conference can not
     be "owned".  To even allude to it is the mark of an individual
     that has trouble with reality.

     There are no rules other the Moravsik's
     rule ie "the biggest .bbs wins".  Conference moderators exist
     only to serve the posters.  If there are any property rights
     the authors of the messages own them.  There is no kitchen, no
     living room, no house.   If a moderator wants CONTROL...simply
     deliver the messages on his/her dime.  Once messages with an
     area tag are routed though "others" each router may decide the
     conditions he/she shall use to modify THEIR areas.bbs.

     ECROC was a volutary code set up circa 1992 at the same time and
     with the same committee that tweeked policy 4 to policy 4.1c.  It
     introduced elections into Fidonet; offered a method to "throw the
     bastards out" and tweeked a few abnomolies in the existing
     policy 4 (ex...IC doesn't have to be a ZC; appeal from a ZC
     decision only goes one way [now it can go up to the IC or to
     the RC's...DUMBBBBB])

     It gave routers a p4 analog.  Many routers found it reasonable.
     Its seems to be a way to "time out" the sandbox mentality.  Some
     moderators found it worked OK.  It doesn't put a router in the
     position of judging.  It just insures certain minimal
     "due process" is present.  It stops the Robbins/Winter/Johnstone
     Milner/Degan mentaility of making up rules as you go and enforcing
     them unequally.  All it requires is that the moderator produce:

     1. The text of the rule that was broken.
     2. The message(s) that broke the rules
     3. Two netmail warnings
     4. The text of messages that show that a person has ignored the
        warnings.

     If those can't be produced...well...we got a sandbox control
     FIDONEWS 13-29               Page 12                  15 Jul 1996


     freak. The proper response is "Pound salt".   The echo splits
     into multiple parts and lives on.  The "zec" can attest to that.
     (whatever a "zec" is...its not in my copy of policy 4).  And no Mr.
     Degan the word MODERATOR cannot be copyrighted or met the test
     of a trademark.  Your claims you have legal protection on the
     AREA:TAG MODERATOR is only in your mind.  I offer you a public
     challenge to test this.

     Hopefully someday, policy 4 will undergo a restatement with a
     policy that balances 5 interests:

     1. The poster
     2. The moderator
     3. The *C's
     4. Whatever policy calls the *lc, *ec *tc etc.
     5. The routers.

     No one group should ever be allowed to unilaterally effect links.
     THERE MUST BE "Due process" much like policy 4.  Until then,
     ECROC is a pretty reasonable analog.  Some moderators may not
     like it...BUT...there are plenty of salt hammers around.  OR
     they can distribute messages OWNED by others written with
     any echotag that is not owned, on their dime.

     MY AREAS.BBS will be changed only when I'm sure the person
     "requesting" the change has demonstrated that the reason
     behind the request was not a product of an infantile temper
     tantrum or a misguided mentality similar to some of the posts
     we see in MODERATOR.  Worry more about forstering communications
     rather then getting your jollies by cutting links.

     These guidelines are similar to the ones published by Bruce
     Bodger for "his" system.  Documentation is required from a
     moderator before a few routers will take any action.  Looks like
     an ECROC analog has been adopted.

     Appendix:

     * ECHOMAIL ROUTING CODE  v 1.05.1

     ECHOMAIL ROUTING CODE  v 1.05.1

     1. Preface:  This is a voluntary code which a router of echomail
     may adopt to insure that echomail links, routing and procedures are
     consistent.

        Conferences are operated and routed for the benefit of the
     participants. They are generally topic oriented and the topic is
     an expansion of the AREA: tag.  The routing of echomail is subject
     to policy 4 of Fidonet as if the messages are NETMAIL.  The AREA
     tag does not change that.

     2. Coordination:  All coordination of traffic in a NET is under the
     supervision of the NC.  To fulfill these responsibilities he may
     delegate all responsibilities except the resolution of disputes to
     any node or group of nodes.  They may function as conference
     FIDONEWS 13-29               Page 13                  15 Jul 1996


     coordinators, echomail coordinators or any title the NC determines
     to assign.

     3. Routing:  Any node may agree with any other node to accept or
     provide netmail messages, which are further identified by AREA
     tags.  If a node has more then one address in a routing file
     (generically known as an areas.bbs file) then he is functioning in
     the capacity of a router.

     4. Links:  A router should realize that there can be many links
     which develop in reliance on their voluntary effort.  Likewise
     there may be instances where a person requests that you should
     modify your .bbs file to add or remove a link.

        a. Adding a link: you can either comply with this or refer the
     person to the NC of your net.  Generally the criteria for adding
     a link can include: economics, prevention of duplicate loops,
     requests by nodes who are within a toll free call.  Adding a link
     is done at you sole discretion.

        b. Deleting a link:  If you are requested to delete a link, you
     should ask that some explanation is given:

        1. If the person is a conference moderator, look in the latest
     issue of the ELIST available at 1/201.  If the person is the
     Elisted moderator (or alternate moderator), request the conference
     rules, any messages that break them and at least proof that two
     netmail warning were given.

        2. If the person is OTHER then the Elisted Moderator or co-
     moderator, refer them to your NC.

     Quite often a request to cut a link is done in the heat of a strong
     debate.  You as a router serve to "time" the parties out for a
     cooling off period.  You are well within your right to refuse to
     cut a link UNLESS the linked node has been excommunicated.

     Since links are done by two party agreement and since there does
     not exist a ratified echomail policy, this code should serve as a
     balance until there is one.

     The InfoMail Document Server
     Damian Walker, 2:2502/666

     This short article has been written to bring to your attention the
     existence of InfoMail, a document server for IBM PC-based Fidonet
     systems.  It is principally of use to systems in an environment where
     routed netmail is available.

     FIDONEWS 13-29               Page 14                  15 Jul 1996


     InfoMail allows your system to post brief informational documents upon
     request, via routed or direct netmail.  This allows you to create
     bulletins and other documents which people can request economically
     from anywhere in the Fidonet network, provided that they have access
     to routed netmail.

     The program features an easy-to-use setup and document list editor,
     and a few bells and whistles such as in-message macros, headers,
     footers, a document access counter and a list of documents generated
     automatically when the user requests a document which doesn't exist.

     You can also arrange for points, or users or sysops of other systems,
     to keep documents updated remotely-- useful in allowing BBS users, and
     other people who cannot run InfoMail on their own systems, to maintain
     bulletins.

     What use is it?  Well, I know of quite a few uses which the program
     has been put to.  I use it to promote my system, to promote the echo
     which I moderate, to promote itself, and to provide information about
     local Fidonet.

     Others have used it to promote their own systems and activities.
     Someone in the UK is setting up an echo rule server using the program,
     while someone in the Netherlands has told me of a plan to offer
     recipies via netmail.  And I have recently learned of a tutor who uses
     it for his course, providing information for students studying for a
     vocational qualification.  The uses of the program are limited only by
     your imagination.

     If this article sounds like an advertisement, don't worry.  The
     program is available in the public domain.  I'm not making any money
     out of it, I just want to share it with you now it's finished, and I
     thought the best way of letting people know about the program is an
     article in FidoNews.

     It's available via file request from 2:2502/666 (in the UK) and
     2:2487/9521 (in Germany), under the magic name of INFOMAIL; it's about
     55k.  I'm not sure where in other zones and regions it might be
     available, so it could pay to look around local systems first.

     For more information about InfoMail, you can ask the program itself--
     netmail INFOMAIL at 2:2502/666 with the subject INFOMAIL. Make sure
     you put something (anything) in the message body so that the message
     won't be deleted before InfoMail sees it.

     Thank you for your interest.

     Region 18 Missing Person Search Echo - R18SEARCH
     by Michael Kirst, 1:3633/36

     This article is intended to inform the reader about what the R18SEARCH
     echo is all about, why it was created, and why other Regions may wish
     to establish a similar echo in their Region.  I will also try to cover
     FIDONEWS 13-29               Page 15                  15 Jul 1996


     what the R18SEARCH echo is NOT.  I will cover what it is not first
     since that is the easier  of the two.

     The R18SEARCH echo is NOT a competing echo for the MISSING and/or
     MISSING_CHILD echos!  It is also NOT intended to replace either of
     those echos.  When it was in it's "formative period", the moderators
     of both of those echos were consulted and informed of the purpose
     behind the R18SEARCH echo.

     The R18SEARCH echo was created as a means of spreading information
     regarding a messing person search within the Southeastern US so as to
     try to blanket the Region with information vital to helping find the
     missing person(s).  The pre-existing MISSING and MISSING_CHILD echos
     are geared for National exposure of missing person information and
     should be so utilized when national coverage is needed/wanted.  During
     the early stages of a missing person search, the probability of the
     missing person being outside of the Region are smaller which would
     therefore prompt a more local distribution of the missing person
     information.

     Prior to the creation of the R18SEARCH echo, there were numerous
     Region 18 echos that could (and were) used to post missing person
     information for a ongoing search.  Unfortunately, there are a lot of
     systems in Region18 that do not carry those echos so the information
     may or may not get distributed.  What brought this need to a head was
     the very high profile search for Shelby Cox.  She was ultimately found
     to have been murdered by her neighbor.  Would/Could the R18SEARCH echo
     have saved Shelby's life?  We will never know.  Sadly that is the case
     with any missing person search.  But one thing that is known in ALL
     missing person searches and that is the fact that the more widely the
     information about the missing person can only help their chances of
     being found.  The sooner the information is gotten out and the wider
     it is distributed, the better the chances for the quick recovery of
     the missing person.  This has been proven time and again.

     One thing that can go a long way toward enhancing the image of Fidonet
     in the eyes of local communities is for local sysops who carry the
     R18SEARCH echo to work at establishing a working relationship with
     their local law enforcement agencies.  The sysop(s) should present
     their BBS and the R18SEARCH echo (and the MISSING and MISSING_CHILD
     echos) as a FREE means for the law enforcement people to get vital
     information distributed about a search in progress.  They could either
     become a user of the BBS (with access settings that would prevent
     their account from expiring) or if the BBS were so equipped, by FAXing
     the information to the BBS.  I have prepared a "stand-alone" Freelance
     slide show presentation that could be used for this purpose.  Please
     contact me via Netmail (1:3633/36) for further information.

     The R18SEARCH echo is the type of echo that one would prefer to NOT
     have a lot of traffic flowing in since that would mean there are not a
     lot of missing people.  But reality sadly proves otherwise.  The rules
     of the R18SEARCH echo are posted in the echo on the 15th and 30th of
     each month.

     I realize that there is no way to compel a sysop to carry any echo
     under the current Fidonet policy.  It should be seen that by carrying
     FIDONEWS 13-29               Page 16                  15 Jul 1996


     the R18SEARCH (and MISSING and MISSING_CHILD) echos could be looked
     upon as helping to make your BBS a more positive "member" of your
     community.  After all if your neighbor's child, a close friend, or a
     loved one were to suddenly become missing, wouldn't you want every
     means available to spread the word about the search for that person?
     As I previously stated, posting messages in the R18SEARCH echo may not
     result in that person being found safe and sound in a short period of
     time, but it certainly will not hurt!  What is requested is that a
     follow up (or "after action") report/message be posted to notify
     people that the search has been concluded and what the final result of
     the search was.

     Old Standards, New Machines
     By Troy H. Cheek, 1:362/708.4

     The question has arisen as to whether FidoNews NEEDS to be in LZH
     format or if it should go to ZIP format.  I can't answer that.  But I
     can use it as an excuse to climb on my soapbox.  :-)

     One of the great dividing lines between Fidonet-style networks and,
     say, Internet-style networks is that while the former may have been
     sending messages via the same technical specifications for what seems
     like forever, the latter seems to change almost weekly.  Sure, it
     takes advantage of all the latest technology, but what about the
     people left in the dust?  What about the people unable (or simply
     unwilling) to spend the time or money necessary to keep up with the
     ever increasing technology?

     The current FidoNews Article Specifications (ARTSPEC.DOC) tell us not
     to use IBM graphics characters.  They tell us that, hard as it might
     be to believe, not everyone in Fidonet is running an IBM compatible.
     By that same token, I'd like to suggest the possibility that not
     everyone in Fidonet is running a computer that could unZIP a file.

     Of course, just to confuse the issue, I'd like to suggest the
     possibility that any machine that can run a Fido-compatible mailer has
     had some version of ZIP available for it.  :-)

     But whether it's changing FidoNews from LZH to ZIP, or changing
     Fidonet mail deliveries from daily to hourly, or changing Fidonet
     technical standards from the current to something more in line with
     the Internet, we have to think not so much about what we'll be
     gaining, but rather what we'll be losing.

     Later,
     Troy

     =================================================================
                                  COLUMNS
     =================================================================


     [This is a test repeat of an article I wrote in 1991 when Tom
      Jennings was still the Editor.  It was quick to hand for a test
      of the .COL submission type since I haven't received any inquiries
      from would-be FidoNews columnists, yet.]

     Christopher Baker
     Rights On!, 1:374/14

     In FidoNews 821, the case for publishing EVERYTHING
     submitted to FidoNews regardless of content or
     applicability was dealt another blow. Publishing
     anything has resulted in a torrent of similar stuff in
     every issue since this article was first written [the day
     after 821 came out].

     This was not the first non-FidoNet related
     article to be published but it was sufficient to get
     me to the word processor.

     Though some are offended by religious proselytizing of that
     sort, I found it more pitiful than offensive and certainly
     a waste of space and transport time in FidoNews. It is also
     an invitation to jihad from every other nutbar superstition
     that decides to use FidoNews for GoodNews or BadNews. [sigh]

     And it's not only religious fundamentalism but the other
     articles on socialism and gender identity and rambling
     trash on the state of the world that bears no resemblance
     to anything of FidoNet or computers in general.

     Historically, FidoNews has published anything sent to it.
     This happened even when there was no identification on the
     material and when it was out of spec for publication. Is
     this a good idea anymore? I don't think so.

     It would be reasonable to restrict content in FidoNews to
     things actually related to FidoNet and telecommunications.
     It would be reasonable to permit announcements of non-
     FidoNet related Echo conferences since Echomail is an
     integral part of FidoNet. It would be reasonable to permit
     announcements of software and discussion of same since this
     is a computer-based Network. It would be reasonable to
     permit the inevitable political give and take concomitant
     with Policy debate and complaint. It would be reasonable to
     permit personal response to personal attack [though both
     should be nipped in the bud by the Editor prior to
     publication] so long as it did not become an endless free-
     for-all.

     I suggest the FidoNews specifications be modified to
     allow material related to FidoNet and to discourage the
     submission of personal problems or pronouncements that have
     nothing whatsoever to do with FidoNet operations or the
     computer world in general.

     The new [old] Editor has decided to continue the policy of
     publishing anything sent that is within specs [ARTSPEC.DOC]
     and not illegal.

     While that may be a noble ambition, I don't think that view
     particularly realistic [of course, they laughed at Fulton,
     too.] nor conducive to encouraging reading of the FidoNet
     newsletter.

     In the current edition [829], the Editor warns of the evils
     of Television and opines that restricting input to FidoNews
     based on actual content will result in 'bland'. On the
     contrary, I think it might result in more readership. A
     socially driven newsletter rather than a topically driven
     newsletter is not the path to follow in this Sysop's opinion.

     The time is ripe for bringing FidoNews back to FidoNet.
     What better time than the changing of the Editorial guard? I
     suggest we start a Netmail writing campaign to Tom J. at
     1:1/1 [1:125/111] protesting the publishing of 'extraneous'
     and non-FidoNet/computer material. FidoNet and computer ops
     is wide enough a venue for FidoNews. Maybe we can start a
     FIDONEWS Echo for discussing Editorial policy? [grin]

     Think about it. Thanks.

     TTFN.

     may wish to post something official where it can be easily found by
     all FidoNews readers.

     Like the other specialty sections, it will only appear when there is

     Subj: EList confirmation received

     FIDONEWS Echo will be EListed in the August 96 list or maybe July 96
     if the Echolist Robot can work it in earlier on the 10th.

     Backbone placement of this Echo will follow directly. I've also asked
     the Stars if I can place this Echo with them for Zones outside of Zone
     1 while awaiting formal Backboning.

     Those of you with existing Echomail links to this system can simply
     Areafix FIDONEWS on with rescan and be up and running. When doing an
     Areafix be sure to use Areafix commands. D'Bridge doesn't do
     Areamanager commands.

     Those who want to feed from here while waiting for Backbone placement
     need only send direct Netmail [don't route passwords!] to me with a
     session and an Areafix password. Specify method of archiving while
     you're at it. Default archiving here is ZIP format. Most of the others
     are available.

     Subj: Statement of Protest of ARS Spam attack--Update--a couple
           requests
     ____________________________________________________________________

     From: noring@netcom.com (Jon Noring)

     Hello,

     Again, I'd like to thank you for your signature to the Statement of
     Protest regarding the vertical spam attack on the newsgroup
     alt.religion.scientology.

     FIDONEWS 13-29               Page 23                  15 Jul 1996


     By your signature you have made a strong statement condemning the
     action as well as putting pressure on the organization probably
     responsible for the attack:  the Church of Scientology.  Your
     signature helped to bring closer attention to the problem, which is
     one of the main goals anyway of the SoP (it would be naive to expect
     that the SoP alone would actually stop the spam).

     And just so you know, I've gathered about 850 signatures, which is
     actually quite good considering that 1) the attempts to cancel the
     spam are succeeding very well, 2) net.focus on this problem is
     receding into the background, and 3) the spam attack occured on a
     special interest newsgroup that only a small fraction of Usenetters
     read.  However, at those sites which don't honor cancels, and which
     the spam has reached, a.r.s. has been rendered unusable, a small
     victory for the spammer.  Fortunately, most sites do honor cancels,
     and the anti-spam campaign has succeeded much better than I ever
     thought it would.

     I really would like to gather the magic 1000 signatures, so I just
     extended the deadline for signatures to July 18.  But that's it, no
     matter how many more I receive.

     Request #1:
     ----------

     I strongly urge you to help me by proactively pointing out to your net
     friends what's happening.  To help you do this, I just reposted to
     various newsgroups, including a.r.s. and comp.org.eff.talk, among
     others, my final solicitation for signatures.  That post refers to the
     original document I posted outlining the problem, which can be
     downloaded via anonymous ftp from
     ftp.netcom.com/pub/no/noring/crisis.txt

     And if you decide to publicly post a support of the SoP, urging others
     to get off their duff and sign it, I would greatly appreciate that a
     lot.  If I get 20 of you posting "yeah, I agree with Jon, sign the SoP
     NOW!", I believe we'll get scores of people to lift their fingers and
     send the e-mail signature to:
     petition-1@netcom.com  (that's petition-"one", NOT petition-"ell".)

     Request #2:
     ----------

     I still have to go through the third-party verification process.
     Because I won't publicly post the signatures, including yours (which
     would be an adequate verification if I could), I have to get a third
     and neutral party to do this for me.  This third party will have to
     select a random sample of e-mail signature addresses (say 20-50 or
     something like that) and then send e-mail to this smaller list, asking
     them if they signed the SoP.  I strongly urge you, if you happen to
     receive one of these verifications, to cooperate with their request.
     They'll probably ask no more than sending e-mail back to them with a
     simple "yeah, I signed the SoP" message, or something similar.


     Anyway, thanks again for your signature.  It shows you care about the
     FIDONEWS 13-29               Page 24                  15 Jul 1996


     integrity of Usenet and its use as an effective vehicle of Freedom of
     Speech.  And please, please, if you haven't yet, put a link on your
     Web page to Ron Newman's site which details the almost 1.5 year
     assault on Usenet by the Church of Scientology.  When I update my
     company's Web pages, I'll add Ron's Web page in a very prominent
     place.  The URL is:

     http://www.cybercom.net/~rnewman/scientology/home.html

     Have a great day!

     Consultants and Consulting Organizations Directory

     If you run a consulting business in the United States or
     Canada, you may want to get it listed free of charge in the
     Consultants and Consulting Organizations Directory.

     To request a questionnaire for the directory, just write
     to the following address:

      Consultants and Consulting Organizations Directory
      Editorial Code and Data, Inc.
      645 Griswold Street, Suite 3480

      U.S.A.
      telephone (313) 961-2926
      fax (313) 961-5919

     Unfortunately, this only applies to consultants in the United States
     and Canada. The directory does not list consultants in other
     countries.

     Free Listings in the Encyclopedia of Associations

     People who start new new non-profit associations (including
     othernets, lobbying groups and associations having nothing to do
     with BBSes) should get their group listed, free of charge, in
     the Encyclopedia of Associations, so that prospective members,
     journalists and researchers can get in touch with them.

     Groups based in the U.S. should write to the following address
     and ask to be listed:
      Editor
      Encyclopedia of Associations
      Gale Research Inc.
      835 Penobscot Building
      Detroit, MI 48226-4094
      Telephone (313) 961-2242
      Fax (313) 961-6815

     Groups based outside the United States should instead get listed
     in International Organizations, a directory published by the same
     company. Its address is:
      Editor
      International Organizations

      U.S.A.
      Telephone +1 313 961-2242
      Fax +1 313 961-6815

     As well, groups based outside the United States may also want to
     get listed in single-country association directories published
     in their own country, such as the Directory of Associations in
     Canada. Any librarian should be able to tell you how to get in
     touch with your country's national association directory, if
     one exists.

     Most large libraries have a copy of the Encyclopedia of
     Associations in hard copy or CD-ROM, but it is probably too
     expensive for someone to buy for home use.

                           QUESTION OF THE WEEK
     =================================================================


     It's way past time to give FidoNet's Nodelist an overhaul as far as
     it is organized.  Zone 2 needs to split out Europe and the former
     Soviet blocs. Zone 7 has been waiting all these years.  The Regions
     could also use some tune ups to distribute the coordination load more

     We are looking for individuals, organizations or firms that are
     located in or do business in the following states, to join in motions
     to intervene in ongoing Bell Atlantic ISDN cases.  The states are:

     We have to file something in New Jersey and Pennsylvania pretty quick.
     A selection of our past filings in these state ISDN proceedings are
     at:

     http://www.essential.org/cpt/isdn/isdn.html, or
     the Bell Atlantic Action page,
     http://www.essential.org/cpt/isdn/bellnews.html

        Todd Paglia from our office is going to write the pleading.  He can
     be contacted at 202-387-8030 or tpaglia@tap.org

        BACKGROUND

        Last fall Bell Altantic (BA) filed terrible tariffs in each of its
     states.  These were about $30 per month plus 1 to 2 cents per minute
     for usage, which was the killer. After much criticism, BA has re-filed
     tariffs which are lower, but still way too high.  In the new filings,
     you can buy 140 hours of one ISDN B channel (70 hours if you bond 2
     together into a single 128 Kpbs line) for $60 per month.  This is
     about .7 cents per minute per channel, and you pay for a block, even
     if you don't use it. (the actual rates are on the CPT ISDN page).

         ISDN doesn't cost the Telco much more than an analog phone,
     according to several studies.  Some telephone companies have
     voluntarily filed much lower tariffs for ISDN, such as $17.90 per
     month, flat rate, in Arkansas, or $29.50 flat rate in parts of
     California.  Ameritech filed flat rate tariffs of $28 to $35 in Ohio,
     Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin.

     In states were the tariffs have been contested, good things have
     happened.  $27 flat rate in Tennessee, where a Commissioner was an
     ISDN user.  In New Mexico, US West wanted $184 for its flat rate, but
     the Commission set the rate at $40.  In Texas, the Commission just set
     a flat rate of $41 for GTE. In Delaware, a Bell Atlantic state, the
     Commission set a rate of $28.02 ($24.52 excluding the $3.50 interstate
     SLC charge).  In Washington DC, there is a proposal before the
     Commission for a $32 flat rate.  Studies of usage costs have ranged
     from 10 cents per hour to 5 cent per day.

       In Delaware and Washington DC, Bell Atlantic has threatened to
     withdraw the service if the Commissions insists on the lower rates.
     But the new telecom act requires them to provide such services, the
     Commissions have the legal power to make it happen, and Bell Altantic
     wants to buy NYNEX, and shouldn't be causing so much grief.

        If we intervene, with local residents or organizations or firms,
     it sends a signal to the Commission that the issue is important (how
     to price the new digital services), and that people want to get the
     service at reasonable rates.

         PUBLIC_KEYS and PKEY_DROP Echos on Zone 1 Backbone

     The PUBLIC_KEYS Echo and PKEY_DROP Echo are available on the
     Zone 1 Backbone.

     The purpose of the Echos is to provide a place to post and
     find public-keys for data privacy within FidoNet and
     elsewhere and to discuss electronic signatures and data and
     software encryption and the various schemes thereof.

     [The rules below are a composite of the rules from each
     Echo. See PUBKEYS.RUL and PKDROP.RUL in the current ELRUL
     file for complete Guidelines for each Echo.]

     These are technical Echos with very few rules. Those very few
     rules are:

     1. Stay on-topic. Topics of keys and privacy are welcome.
        Others are not.
     2. No politics [except as it relates to privacy issues] and
        no religion.
     3. No personal attacks, slurs or innuendo. Stick to issues
        not personalities.
     4. No Private flagged messages in Echomail! PGP traffic
        using public-keys is permitted for the exercise so long
        as it is on-topic and anyone can read it.
     5. This Echo may be traveling around the world so try to be
        concise. Avoid excessive quoting for one-liner responses.
     6. Be aware that Echomail is NOT secure. Don't take anything
        at face value.
     7. The posts in this Echo are the sole responsiblity of the
        poster. If you need verification, use Netmail.
     8. The Moderators will deal with off-topic traffic. Don't
     FIDONEWS 13-29               Page 36                  15 Jul 1996


        respond for them. Links to this Echo will only be
        curtailed when absolutely necessary so please don't make
        it necessary. [grin]

     The Moderators are Christopher Baker [KeyID: 2048/D881B549]
     and GK Pace [KeyID: 2048/B604EBE9] at 1:374/14 and 1:374/26,
     respectively.

     It is recommended that public-keys be made available via
     Netmail or by file-request with the magic filename: PGPKEY
     and that the public-key provided for that request by given
     a distinctive filename using part or all of each provider's
     name and address. For example, on my system, a file-request
     of PGPKEY will give BAK37414.ASC to the requesting system.
     This will avoid duplicate overwriting and make it easier to
     track the keys. Using a standard magic filename will make it
     easier to find keys on different systems.

     These Echos are on the Zone 1 Backbone. The PKEY_DROP Echo
     is for placing public-keys in circulation in a central area
     available to all. This Echo has been EListed since ELIST211.
     Please feel free to announce and distribute this Echo to all
     interested participants in your area.

     Make standard requests to your normal Backbone source for
     these Echos and find out what we're doing. Join us in
     discovering new possibilities.

     "Pretty Good Privacy" MSDOS executables and source files for
     porting to other platforms are available as PGP and PGPSRC
     from this system and many others. Both archives were
     hatched into the SDS in the SOFTDIST area and should be
     available at an SDS site near you. PGP source and executables from
     here are RESTRICTED to Zone 1 Nodes only! Folks outside Zone 1 can
     find versions on the Internet and local BBSes.

     Thanks.

     TTFN.
