     =================================================================

                     Time Flies When You're Having Fun

     I've been editing this newsletter for over two years now.  Why do
     I keep doing it?  At least partly  because  it  isn't  that  much
     bother.   As   long  as  everyone  goes  along  with  the  simple
     guidelines given in ARTSPEC.DOC,  which almost everyone does,  it
     pretty much takes care of itself.  Meanwhile,  every now and then
     I get to sound off in one of these editorials.  By and large it's
     been fun,  and when it hasn't been fun at least it hasn't been  a
     bother.

     I  have  a long history of running newsletters.  I was the editor
     of my high school newspaper (a real fishwrapper if there ever was
     one), and I was a shoo-in for the job.  Way back in sixth grade I
     started the first newsletter in the whole school. [The school was
     in its first year when I was in sixth  grade.  It  covered  first
     through  twelfth,  and  had about 300 people when I graduated.  I
     graduated in a class of eighteen.  Growing up  in  a  small  town
     does have its advantages.]

     Writing  these  editorials  seems to give me a different slant on
     things that I normally have.  I feel as if I'm  taking  something
     of  a  longer  view.  I  have  this conception of FidoNet as some
     great and glorious mechanism to allow ordinary people  (well,  as
     ordinary as BBS users ever get) to reach out to each other.  When
     I sit down to write an editorial I remember that view,  and I try
     to talk about it.  And who knows?  Maybe I even make a difference
     in some small way.  If so, then it's certainly worth it.

     Do you share ny vision?  I hope  so.  Yes,  we  have  our  little
     squabbles.  But take any three people and sit them down, and they
     will  have  their  differences of opinion.  We have much the same
     situation,   only  on  a  larger  scale  and  vastly   amplified.
     Sometimes  it  can  seem  almost  too much to bear.  But remember
     this: Nobody ever guaranteed you that everyone would always agree
     with you.  There will always be those (not always the same  ones)
     who  disagree  with your viewpoint.  That is the price we pay for
     such unparalleled freedom of expression.  In return for having so
     many people hear your  viewpoint,  you  must  pay  the  price  of
     hearing  viewpoints  from  those  who disagree with you.  You can
     refuse to pay that  price,  but  then  your  own  voice  will  be
     silenced.

     We  really do want to hear from you.  So some people may disagree
     with you.  Maybe some of  them  will  even  descend  to  personal
     invective.  Just  remember,  the  same  is  true  of any personal
     contact.  That is a price you must pay to make your voice heard.

     Jean Coppola Opus 107/201

            FILELIST.EXE...One Sysop's Solution To File Requests

     With the advent of file requests I have  devised  a  new  utility
     that helps the Sysop cope with file requests.

     FILELIST.EXE is a utility that reads all the available files on a
     system  into  one  file,  sorts  them  and  produces a file named
     REQUEST.TXT and then arc's it into a file called REQUEST.ARC.

     Unlike other utilities along this line FILELIST.EXE will run with
     either Fido  or  Opus  and  should  remain  compatible  with  new
     versions of both software packages.

     This  utility DOES NOT read the system files instead it runs from
     a batch file and as long as there are files named  FILES.BBS  and
     as  long as they contain available software this utility will not
     need updating.

     FILELIST can be run as an eXternal event from either  Fido,  Opus
     or  SEAdog  and  will  compile a list of available files and then
     return control to the software that called it.

     Here is a small sample of the output from FILELIST.EXE:

     Files Available From Opus 107/201 - 516-775-5811
     Updated On 05-10-1987 At 11:35:03

     ansianim.arc Produces Ansi Graphic Screens
     arc.exe Arc 5.20 Utility
     arce.com Fast Arc Extractor
     arcmail.arc Arc's/UnArc's Net Mail
     arcmsg12.arc Save Those Message For Posterity
     arcpeek.arc Allows Reading of *.Arc Files
     autodate.arc Sets Time Without Clock Card

     There Are A Total Of 7 Files Listed.

     As you can see the files are sorted by name and then placed  into
     the  file  with  the  identity of the system and the phone number
     placed in the file for ease in locating the Net/Node  number  and
     phone number.

     FILELIST.ARC may be requested from 107/201 and contains all files
     needed to implement this on your system.

                International Nodes, "The Zones Are Coming"

     ))))  The Problem   ((((

     We are TOO successful.  The nodelist is getting to be 1700 nodes.
     The nodediff files are getting big.  The zones  are  coming.  The
     zones are coming.  This will have a large effect on our nodelist.

     The  nodelist  is  THE  most important thing we have!  It is more
     important than FidoNews,  more important than echos.  We  do  not
     use routed mail very much, but it is the tie that binds.

     The  nodediff  takes  too long to send.  It takes too long to run
     Xlatlist or Listgen.  It consumes disk space.  The  text  version
     is too long for most users to download and use.

     Long   nodelists   encourage  outdated  nodelists.   An  outdated
     nodelist is VERY dangerous with outbound mail,  especially direct
     mail.  If  I  change numbers,  the phone company may reissue that
     number.  What if someone sends files attached?  Every night at  4
     am,  some  LOL (Little 'Ol Lady) will have her phone ring with no
     one on the other end.  If that sounds funny,  let  me  know  your
     home VOICE number, and let me try it on YOU.

     What  if  the net / node number changes?  There are boards that I
     like to contact when I need them.  I do not need them very often,
     but when I do, it is VERY useful.  With multi-line BBS coming up,
     phone numbers will change more often.


     <<< Present Solution >>>

     ZONE:  level of hierarchy that is higher  than  net.  It  implies
     that  nodes  with  a  zone will have limited nodelist information
     outside  their  zone.  Each  zone  will  have  own  nodelist  and
     nodediff.   Zones  will  have  their  own  coordinator  who  will
     supervise his portion of the nodelist.  They may  have  different
     policy. (Policy 7 Zone 3??).

     The  International FidoNet Coordinator will install these changes
     in stages.  IC will define zones as  continents.  Later,  the  IC
     could  split  zones  by  countries.  Someday,  the  USA  could be
     several zones!

     How does this affect the average sysop?  How to send  mail  to  a
     node in another zone?

     ---Routed Mail---

     A sysop could send mail "de-coupled." "De-coupled" means that the
     sending  software  sends  mail to another place without verifying
     that the  net/node  exist.  Fido  allows  that.  (TJ  hates  that
     option.)  That is similar to "shooting an arrow into the air," or
     USENET revisited.  Sending mail to 2:107/6  would  be  routed  to
     2:/0  and  that  node  would  route  (if possible).  (By the way,
     points are always de-coupled.  That is another discussion.)
     FidoNews 4-20                Page 4                   24 May 1987


     You cannot send a piece of mail to a specific address if  you  do
     not have that address.

     What  is  the effect?  Easy,  orphans!  Orphans are messages that
     cannot leave that node.  What does a node do with  Orphans?  Once
     again with another patch we can fix.  I guess the orphan receiver
     would  send net message that "Addressee no long there." The point
     is that "Orphans" are the net equivalent of "Dupes." (GASP!)

     --- Non-Routed Mail ---

     The sending sysop must generate and maintain a private  nodelist!
     If  107/6 changes phone number,  how will I know?  If I change my
     personal phone number or node number,  who will I notify and how?
     My  guess  is  that if I notify others they will not update their
     lists.  The "bottom line" is that zones  will  inhibit  net  mail
     traffic across zone lines.

     We are encouraging outdated private nodelist with no nodes in the
     nodelist on the other side of the zone.


     >>> My Proposal <<<


     --- Description ---

     Super nodelist with skeleton entries:  all zones, all regions and
     all network hosts.  That nodelist can include  nodes  from  other
     zones that "register" as an International Node.

     Definition- International Node (IN)- a Node that sends / RECEIVES
     direct  mail across zone (regional) boundaries.  IN is not a more
     important node just  one  that  RECEIVES  DIRECT  MAIL.  (No  one
     should register for vanity).

     Registration- International FidoNet Coordinator (IC) will control
     the  super  nodelist  with  updates  from  Regional  Coordinators
     (RC's).  The RC will give nodelist with host and IN net  /  node.
     The  RC  will  be  responsible  to  see  that all IN are properly
     registered.

     The IC MAY require that International Nodes pay  a  fee.  He  may
     give  discount  to  IFNA members.  Suggested $10 charter members.
     $25 new IFNA members.  $40 to non members.  Is  that  reasonable?
     IFNA  was formed to help pay for nodelist generation,  of course!
     It is voluntary.  You do not have to pay anything to  be  in  the
     nodelist and send and receive mail.  Just extra to receive DIRECT
     (crash) mail or files or file requests.


     Conversion  will  be  painful.  It does require that all regional
     and   network   coordinators   cooperate   and   convert    semi-
     simultaneously.  I  cannot imagine an uncooperative RC or NC.  (A
     little irony here.)  Zones  were  going  to  be  painful  anyway.
     Software  to merge nodelist and generate local nodediff will have
     FidoNews 4-20                Page 5                   24 May 1987


     to be written, debugged, and published.  That is not trivial, but
     not impossible either.

     --- Pro ---

     You are  in  the  nodelist  for  free.  People  contribute  money
     because they want to contribute.

     You  can still send routed mail easily.  It is possible without a
     complete nodelist.  It is going to have to  be  possible  because
     the  nodelist  will be split unless we change our direction.  You
     can send no-route mail to "registered" nodes at no "extra" fees.

     We remain a INTERNATIONAL  and  NATIONAL  organization.  We  will
     remain more unified.

     --- Con ---

     The  program  to  have  multiple  updates of the nodelist may not
     exist.  It may cost  money  to  be  International  Node.  It  may
     require zone and point support software.

     NIH (not invented here).

     ======== Conclusion =======

     We  have  too  much of a good thing.  The process will take time.
     To do nothing will invite chaos.  Let us discuss it.  I  want  to
     avoid the divisiveness that zones can cause.

     Opus 109/612-617

                    A Truly Elegant Piece of Engineering

     On March  23,  1987,  A  representative  of  Telebit  Corporation
     delivered   two   Trailblazer   modems  to  me  for  testing  and
     evaluation.  On May 11,  1987,  I called that same representative
     and  asked  that  the  modems  be  picked  up  as  my testing was
     complete.  Here is what happened in-between and my conclusions.

     I was informed by a fellow sysop,  Bob  Catt,  that  Telebit  was
     going  to  hold  a demonstration of their Trailblazer modems at a
     location very close to my office.  Bob invited me to attend.  The
     demonstration consisted  of  connecting  two  PC's  together  via
     Trailblazers  and  two  via conventional modems.  The connections
     were direct cable connections.  Some files  were  sent  back  and
     forth  and  the  cables  were  pulled out and plugged back during
     transmission.  All in all, it was a very impressive demonstration
     of the high speed capability of the Trailblazer.

     In part due to my position as a sysop  and  in  part  due  to  my
     position  with Boeing Computer Services,  I was offered a pair of
     modems for evaluation.  I was anticipating an extended (a  month)
     trip  to our offices in Seattle so I thought that would provide a
     nice cross-country demonstration.  The two modems arrived  at  my
     office the afternoon before my flight.

     The  Telebit reps and I experimented for about two hours,  trying
     to get one of the modems to work with SEAdog or with one of three
     or four terminal emulator packages that I had in  my  office.  We
     did  not  succeed.  We  installed  a specially updated version of
     CROSSTALK for testing and found that package did work.  The  reps
     left me with the two modems and the special version of CROSSTALK.

     I  took  all  of  this  home  with  me and tried again to get the
     Trailblazer to work with my other bbs (also SEAdog 4.0) at  home.
     After three hours,  I gave up, put one of the Trailblazers on the
     shelf and began to pack for my trip.  I took one Trailblazer with
     me along with a Toshiba 1100 lap top that a friend had loaned  me
     for the trip.

     I  must  confess  that I knew very little about PC's connect with
     and use  serial  communications  facilities.  My  experience  was
     almost  totally  with  mainframe communications.  As a result,  I
     spent about 20-30 hours experimenting with the  Toshiba  and  the
     Trailblazer   and   CROSSTALK   before   I   came   to  any  real
     understanding.

     Here  is  what  I  learned.   Modems  have   two   communications
     functions.  One  is  to  communicate with another modem over some
     sort of path,  usually the dialup phone network.  The other is to
     communicate with the terminal, which in our case is normally a PC
     of  some  sort.  The  speed  of EACH of these communications MUST
     match what the other  device  is  expecting.  The  usual  set  of
     "Hayes compatible" modems force these two communications to occur
     FidoNews 4-20                Page 7                   24 May 1987


     at  the  same  speed.  The Trailblazer controls these separately.
     With the exception of the updated version of CROSSTALK,  none  of
     the software I experimented with was prepared to deal with this.

     Up  to this point in my experiences with PCs,  I had heard of the
     MODE command but had never seen it used and did not know  of  any
     reason  to  use  it.  Now  I  discovered  that  nearly  all of my
     software was issuing a MODE command internally to set  the  speed
     of  the serial interface card to match either the designated dial
     out speed,  or the reported connect speed,  when in answer  mode.
     CROSSTALK   was   telling   the   Trailblazer   to   set  its  PC
     communications speed first and then changing the serial interface
     speed.  All the other packages were simply changing the interface
     speed  and  assuming   the   modem   was   changing   its   speed
     automatically.  The  Trailblazer was not.  When the modem and the
     serial  port  "talk"   at   different   speeds,   there   is   no
     communication.

     The  Trailblazer  is  equipped  with  a  very impressive array of
     internal registers that control  all  functions  and  parameters.
     There  are  no dip switches.  After a rather time consuming study
     of the manual, I discovered that the Trailblazer can be set up to
     automatically detect the rate at which the PC is talking  to  it.
     I  set  up  that mode and tried to go on.  Next I discovered that
     once a speed was set,  the automatic rate detect became disabled.
     Thus  if  I  dialed out at one speed,  all well and good but if I
     tried  to  dial  out  again  at  a  different   speed,   I   lost
     communication  with  the  modem.  I will note in passing that the
     factory default speed in fixed at 9600 in the modem and  all  the
     machines I tested power up their serial cards at 2400.

     More  studying  of the book and I decided I could reset the modem
     to automatic detect by forcing it to run its internal diagnostics
     after every outbound call.  I also found I  could  delete  (thank
     you  Peter  Norton) the code in my terminal emulator package that
     resets the serial port speed.  Very painful,  but at least I  now
     understood what was going on and where the problems were.

     I  used the Trailblazer from Seattle to call my bbs's (one with a
     USRobotics 2400 and one with a Rixon  1200)  and  perform  remote
     maintenance.  I also used it to call from the Toshiba to the PC I
     was  using  at  work  to  transmit  files from the Toshiba 3 1/2"
     format to the PC 5 1/4" format.  Nothing very  exciting,  but  it
     did a job for me that I needed.

     When I got home (a little early) I began in ernest to try and get
     the Trailblazers to work.  I was referred to Ray Gwinn who, I was
     told,  had  done  some extensive work with the Trailblazers.  Ray
     was wonderfully helpful.  He sent me a beta test version  of  his
     serial driver to replace OPUSCOMM and explained that indeed,  the
     Trailblazer worked as I had been guessing.  He further  explained
     that  I could get the Trailblazer to work with SEAdog better if I
     forced the communications to the PC  to  hold  at  9600  and  his
     serial  driver  would  take care of ignoring SEAdog's attempts to
     match the serial card to the dialout speed.  I tried this but got
     a continuous message about Modem Failure from SEAdog.
     FidoNews 4-20                Page 8                   24 May 1987


     I thought I was smart by then so I looked for some code in SEAdog
     to delete,  I didn't find any.  I then tried stepping through the
     startup  code of SEAdog using the Codeview debugger that I bought
     with my Microsoft C compiler.  Much to my  surprise,  the  Trail-
     blazer  worked.  Some more phone calls later,  I learned that the
     firmware in my modems was not the version needed for dialout use.
     Telebit kindly offered to send me a new  set  of  PROMS  which  I
     accepted.  After  installing  them,  still no success.  A call to
     Thom Henderson revealed that SEAdog was waiting for an "OK"  from
     the  modem  and  didn't  think it was getting it.  Telebit had no
     idea what I should do next.  In a flash of desperation, I deleted
     the modem setup and modem reset (and even the modem  type)  cards
     from  my SEAdog control file.  Wonderful!  The modem seemed to be
     working.

     Imagine my disappointment over the next two days as I  discovered
     that no caller at 1200 baud was getting successful communication.
     The  connect  appeared  to be OK but on the Opus end I just say a
     continuous stream  of  garbage  while  the  caller  saw  nothing.
     Another  call to Telebit told me only that "maybe it's your phone
     line".  In desperation, I tried removing the filtered phone cable
     that came with the Trailblazer.  Sure  enough,  success.  In  the
     process  of  that latest conversation,  I learned that the Trail-
     blazer was designed first to communicate only with  other  Trail-
     blazers.  The  emulation of other modems was added later.  I also
     learned that a caller at 300 baud must allow 5 seconds  of  total
     silence  on  the  line  for  the connect to be successful.  This,
     after the caller's modem reports successful connect.  What do you
     suppose is the chance of that happening?  Oh well,  I  suppose  I
     would be willing to effectively exclude all 300 baud callers.

     Too   bad,   I  also  noticed  some  other  problems.   When  the
     Trailblazer answers the phone,  it  first  tries  to  connect  to
     another  Trailblazer.  I  suppose  that  is  reasonable.  The odd
     sound it makes scares off some callers however.  After two tries,
     the  Trailblazer  tries  some  emulation  modes.  Too  bad,  some
     callers  hang up before the Trailblazer gets to the right version
     for them.  Even worse,  SEAdog 3.82 is one that hangs up.  I know
     how  to  tell  people to change their terminal packages to wait a
     little longer.  I have no idea how to tell SEAdog to wait longer.

     Rather than give up, I called Telebit yet again.  I learned about
     a register that turns off Trailblazer mode entirely and makes the
     modem act just like a normal 2400 that we are used  to.  I  tried
     that too.  Yes, my callers can get it.  No one was hanging up too
     soon.  Of course,  this $675 modem was doing nothing more than my
     $375 USR could do but...  Well, the Trailblazer is SO technologi-
     cally WONDERFUL, I just liked having it there.  Besides,  perhaps
     some day they would get the problems fixed and then only a change
     of  PROMS  would get me the latest version.  I have no doubt that
     Telebit would happily supply  them.  I  am  VERY  impressed  with
     their  willingness  to  help  and  their  commitment to providing
     support.

     But the fates were not to be on my side.  All  of  my  users  who
     have Everex modems began complaining that they could not complete
     FidoNews 4-20                Page 9                   24 May 1987


     even  short  downloads  successfully.  All of them terminate with
     "too many errors".  With a heavy heart,  I finally gave up.  Just
     for completeness,  I did try several calls to Telebit to see what
     a connect to another Trailblazer was like.  To my surprise, I was
     not especially impressed.  From the panel lights on the modem,  I
     judged  there  to be a lot of line idle time that defeats most of
     the high speed.

     So what do we have at this point.  The Trailblazer is designed to
     talk  primarily  to  other  Trailblazers.  The  error  correcting
     capability  in  that mode presents only good data blocks.  To get
     good performance under  those  circumstances  requires  that  the
     software  do  no protocol type error checking,  except,  perhaps,
     after an  entire  file  has  been  transmitted.  The  Trailblazer
     answers calls and looks for another Trailblazer first.  When used
     in  dial  out mode,  the caller must not be allowed to change the
     speed of the serial interface.  SEAdog will not do file  transfer
     correctly  if  the  interface  speed  is  higher than 9600.  This
     latter limits the overall speed to 9600 even though the modem can
     burst to 18,000.

     As an aside,  at the service bureau where I work,  we  could  not
     dare  to install modems that take so long to establish connection
     and  will  not  communicate  correctly  with  all  of  the  large
     assortment  of  modems  that  currently  call  in here.  As a bbs
     operator,  I feel I have the same obligation to my  callers.  So,
     with  a  heavy heart,  I called Telebit and asked them to pick up
     the modems.

     Personally,  I  admire  elegant  engineering  and  love  to  have
     examples of such in my possession.  The Trailblazer is one of the
     best  examples of elegant engineering I have seen.  The idea of a
     microprocessor based device that will behave like almost anything
     you want with just a change of PROM is clearly  the  way  of  the
     future.  Unfortunately,  I  cannot  afford  to  just stick one of
     these on the shelf and wait.  And, I cannot,  in good conscience,
     put  it  on  my  system  and  exclude  a segment of my users.  My
     decision is that I WANT a Trailblazer, but not quite yet.

     I would like to offer my sincere thanks to Ted Brown and  Telebit
     for  their generous assistance and support,  to Ray Gwinn for his
     also very generous help, and to Longshot Xi (one of my users) who
     spent several hours with his Everex modem  running  tests  at  my
     bidding.

                          Multi FIDO application.
                          =======================

     At the time I had only a IBMPC compatible, the Philips P3101
     with  10 mbytes harddisk,  I had take provisions on hardware
     and software level,  such, my FIDO did run for weeks without
     a hangup.  Remotely,  I did my daily sysop work,  which  was
     mainly the maintenance of the USER.BBS,  looking to the MAIL
     and SHUFFLE. I mostly did do this from a remote point, so at
     home  I  did find it terrible to put down my FIDO for  local
     SYSOP work.  Especially,  why it sometimes takes some houres
     to rearrange with SHUFFLE etc.  the good looking of my  BBS.
     So  stronghly  I did need a multi-user application above  or
     instead MSDOS.
     At  this moment my FIDO is working for weeks  without  going
     down  for  a single moment,  except for the  MAIL.  This  is
     reached  with  MULTILINK  with  a  high  priority  FORGROUND
     partitioning and 2 BACKGROUND FIDO partitionings, from which
     the 2e can be put down for my own MSDOS work. Why MULTILINK.
     Well, I had the possibility between DOUBLEDOS, CONC-DOS, MS-
     WINDOWS  and MULTILINK.  As I only got a formal copy of  the
     last  three,  I  did not observe DOUBLEDOS.  Perhaps  it  is
     better.
     MSWINDOWS was very nice,  but only one program can be actual
     running  at the time and the rest is hanging on the wall  as
     an ICON.  Moreover, it did eat my DISK and memory space more
     than I did like.
     CONC-DOS  did  run very well,  but was also a big  eater  of
     space.  But I found it much easier than MSDOS. Finally I got
     MLINK and as this was specific written for a Multi- terminal
     environment I did select him for my work.  Above that, realy
     it  is  a wait-watcher.  Only 35 kbytes it  consumes.  So  I
     selected MULTILINK.

     MULTILINK.
     ==========
     I  had  a lot of problems to understand the real working  of
     multilink,  but after a lot of tests,  I learned how to cope
     with it.  With multilink the tuning of the priority and time
     setting  was  the most crittical.  Also I did  need  another
     version   of  ANSI.SYS,   which  I  got  from  the   Support
     departement.  The  commandline params NODIS,  DIS and  NVDIS
     were the ones which cost me 3 weeks to find out how to  use.
     In appendix I give my BAT-files as it runs now perfect.  See
     also the NVDIS and NODIS statements arround the :OUTSIDE and
     :DOSEXIT part of RUNFIDOx.BAT. They are extremely important.
     Here  I  will only give some tips to deal which  if  another
     FidoNews 4-20                Page 11                  24 May 1987


     program has to be added in the BAT file.  Also some specific
     FIDO  aspects I measured are written down and maybe will  of
     some help to you.

     FIDO1 and FIDO2 and mailing.
     ===============
     With fido, 2 params can be set to make a distinqtion between
     the  2 FIDO's.  That are the commandline 1 and 2 and the 1/I
     and 2/I switches.  The first 2 defining the COM-port and the
     second  the <file>.LOG handling.  These only works  for  the
     SYSOPx.LOG  and  the  MAILERx.LOG  files,  where  x=1  or  2
     depending  the  x/I  command  line  switch.  The  SCHED.BBS,
     USER.BBS  etc.  are  used  commenly by  the  2  FIDO's.  The
     USER.BBS is of course logical,  as long as you have one fido
     with 2 telephone lines in one hardware engine. The SCHED.BBS
     however,  I believe there is a problem.  I found out that at
     mailing  time,  both  FIDO's did exactly the same within  20
     sec. difference. So at mailtime, both are defining the to be
     mailed  files and try to send them.  Of cource the *.IN  and
     *.OUT  files  are created in the  same  area,  the  fidonet-
     subdirectory.  I didn't believe this could work correct,  so
     to  be sure I did search for a solution.  And well,  I found
     out that at the moment FIDO starts up (FIDO_IBM),  it copies
     the SCHED.BBS into memory  and never needs the file if  fido
     stays running.  Exept with the sysop 6 and 7 commands,  fido
     update  the present SCHED.BBS.  So One fido is doing now all
     the  houskeeping  and  mailing  tasks  and  one  is  running
     continouesly.  This was made available with a SCHEDN.BBS and
     a  SCHEDE.BBS,  which  are loaded as SCHED.BBS  just  before
     FIDO_IBM  is started.  In my case SCHEDE.BBS is real  empty,
     but you can change it as long as the tasks are different.  I
     need  at  this moment the second fido as  sysop  fido,  with
     which  I  can do sysopwork at any time.  The  COM2  port  is
     connected to an internal cable, with which I downstairs in a
     corner  of  the  livingroom can do the sysop  work.  Also  I
     prepare  there on a CPM own build engine my  textfiles  like
     this and upload them on 2400 baud in the fido.  If I have to
     much,  I go outside,  load kermit and transmit with 19 kbaud
     the  stuff  direct  in the FIDO engine.  If you  have  a  2-
     line/one number telephone connection, you can go to a event,
     where the second modem is put offline, so that all incomming
     mailcalls  are forwarded to FIDO-1,  to be handled for mail.
     This  depends  strongly  on  your  local  telephone  company
     arrangements and possibilities.  In that case if you like  a
     third  FIDO for SYSOP work,  create a third  partition.  The
     minimum statement in MLINK for FIDO (Version 11W) is /0,140,
     But  if you have things like FIDOINTR or OUTSIDE working 200
     kbyte looks fine.

     MULTILINK NVDIS, DIS and NODIS commands.
     ========================================
     I did start with MLUTIL DIS,  as the books told me, that was
     the  most  optimal,   because  the  keyboard  requests  were
     reduced.
     It runs, only the programs FILELIST and SYSREPT did do about
     3 hours to come to an end.  (should be less then 5  minuts).
     FidoNews 4-20                Page 12                  24 May 1987


     So  first  I did put MLUTIL NODIS before these commands  and
     again a MLUTIL DIS after.  It was running.  On a Job outside
     holland  (remote sysop),  I did an 0 (nul) command and  only
     everey  5 sec.  I got a character.  Terrible of  course.  So
     again  trying out.  As fido has slow reacting users even  on
     2400  baud,  it  was  better to put the  main  part  of  the
     programs into MLUTIL NODIS (normal) and only the OUTSIDE and
     DOSEXIT  (0-command)  in NVDIS mode.  This was  finally  the
     best.  If I have a new program to be put into the BAT-file I
     do  try  out  its reaction first in a single  command  mode,
     playing with DIS and NVDIS mainly.
     With a third COM-port, I did try out the terminal emulation.
     So if you change in the AUTOEXEC.BAT the MLINK into:
     MLINK /0,200 /0,200 /3,32,<n>,9600
     you have a nice MSDOS on a remote terminal,  which can be of
     any type. For <n> you have to fill in a digit (1 to 12)
     1=tty,2=ADDS viewpoint,3=LSI ADM3A,4=televideo 910,5=DEC VT-
     52,6=fortune,7=televideo      912C/920C/925,8=ANSI-standard,
     9=User defined,10=PC shadow,11=hazeltine,12=telepathy.
     Run MLCUSTOM.COM to define the 9.
     Noted: The MLINK you can only start once, but with a command
     line  MLUTIL TERM <n> you can redefine the emulation on  the
     third port.  In AUTOEXE3.BAT you have to put MLUTIL ENQ  -7,
     as I used the 2e PRN as COM3.
     With this teminal emulation, a 2e DOS-user is possible (Your
     Wife/Husband)  mutch  better than a redirection with CTTY  =
     COM3
     Some short explanation of the used command lines.
     =================================================
     MLSLICE activates the time slicing. (portions of 18.1818 ms
     MLINK /<port>,<mem.size>,|<term. type>|,|<speed>|
            Port 0 is dummy.
     MLUTIL  ENQ -IRQ where IRQ is the  interupt  level.  4=COM1,
     3=COM2, 10=COM3, 11=COM4 (10 and 11 only for AT)
     MLUTIL  TIME  n   where n is the number of  slice  portions,
     the partitioning will get.
     MLUTIL  PRI  n where n is 0 (low) till  7  (high)  priority.
     Never   put   the   forground   in   the   lowest,   because
     nearly your forground is useless.  Even it took me 30 minuts
     to type a new command line.
     The MLSPOOL and MLPRINT works fine too. All the other ones I
     didn't use in the FIDO environment.
     I work with MSDOS 3.10 and Multilink 4.00.  It works now for
     month with no single hangup.
     Succes with MULTILINK!

                     -- The Regular Irregular Column --
                                Dale Lovell
                                  157/504

          This has  been an eye-opening week. Boris Osadciw (the sysop
     of 157/46) sent out a  message  to  the  local  net  about  a new
     program  called  DUTCHIE  which  he  claimed was a sort of public
     domain SEAdog. While that isn't actually  the truth,  the program
     is interesting. In addition to checking out DUTCHIE, I also ended
     up looking at a new (to me) FOSSIL driver. This all led to a busy
     week, but  I've already  noticed that  there never  seems to be a
     week that isn't busy. First off the FOSSIL driver.

     -- X.00 (or X00.SYS) --

          X00.SYS is a low level communications driver that adheres to
     the  FOSSIL  standards  set  by  Vince Perriello (141/491) and is
     written by Ray Gwinn (109/639). While that sounds  like a  lot it
     isn't that hard to understand. FOSSIL stands for Fido/Opus/SEAdog
     Standard Interface Layer, and  is basically  a standard developed
     for use  with communications (or BBS) programs. It was originally
     developed to allow the DEC Rainbow  to run  SEAdog. At  about the
     same  time  Wynn  Wagner  was  having  problems with Opus and the
     Greenleaf(tm) Communications Libraries. It was suggested that the
     extended driver for SEAdog could be used with Opus and the FOSSIL
     driver was born. FOSSILs take over  all  of  the  low  level work
     associated with communications ports (and the screen and keyboard
     in some cases) such as setting the baud rate, and  doing the hard
     work of  actually sending  and receiving characters. If a program
     is capable of using a FOSSIL, it should run on any MS-DOS machine
     (not  necessarily  an  IBM  compatible machine) that has a FOSSIL
     driver written for it (currently  the  IBM  PCs  and compatibles,
     Tandy 2000, and Sanyo 555 to name a few).

          Some of  you may  already be  familiar with  a FOSSIL driver
     since Opus requires one. Bob Hartman's  Opus!Comm was  one of the
     first FOSSIL  drivers, and  was originally distributed with Opus.
     Opus!Comm is installed as a TSR or memory resident program. It is
     usually run  in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file just like hundreds of other
     TSRs (Sidekick, Prokey, etc).  X00.SYS uses a different approach.
     It is installed as a device drive in  your  CONFIG.SYS  file.  It
     doesn't really make any difference how a FOSSIL is installed, but
     there  are  different  ways (make sure you read the documentation
     for your FOSSIL).

          The part of X00.SYS that caught my eye is the support for up
     to eight different communications ports.  It was written to allow
     MultiLink  to  get along with Opus (and SEAdog),  and should work
     with most of the multitaskers currently available (DoubleDos  for
     example).  As  many  of us "know," SEAdog and Opus will only work
     on COM1 and COM2.  So what's the advantage  of  having  a  FOSSIL
     supports all these ports?  X00.SYS will allow you to "fake out" a
     program  and  make it think it's using COM1 or COM2,  while it is
     actually using a formerly unsupported port.  I think  this  could
     be  very useful because it's been my experience that serial ports
     are   always   in   short   supply   (Mouse,    laser    printer,
     FidoNews 4-20                Page 22                  24 May 1987


     modem...hmmm...one  port  short).  Since most commercial programs
     won't  take  advantage   of   a   FOSSIL,   you   could   run   a
     SEAdog/Opus/whatever on COM3 while running a serial mouse on COM1
     and  a  serial laser printer (like an Apple LaserWriter) on COM2.
     This  greatly  expands  the  usefulness  of  SEAdog   and   Opus,
     especially  since  X00.SYS  can  support up to 8 different serial
     ports at once.

          I'm going into all this detail on FOSSIL drivers because the
     program I'm about to cover  requires  one.  I  think  the program
     shows  great  promise,  and  is  going to expand the net into the
     point extensions very quickly.

     -- DUTCHIE by Henk Wevers (500/1) --

          When I first heard  about  DUTCHIE,  it  was  "billed"  as a
     public domain  SEAdog. This  is not  the full  truth, as a better
     description is the first  operational point  software.

          Points are part of the extended FidoNet addressing that  has
     been settled by the standards committee.  What points boil to, as
     far as I'm concerned, is instead of being user number 72,  I'd be
     known as 157/504.72.  Instead of calling up a board and trying to
     keep up in several echomail conferences online,  I could poll  my
     boss   node  and  pickup  all  the  echomail  conferences  I  was
     interested in reading.  Read the conferences at  my  own  leisure
     (no  worrying  about  how much time I've got left),  reply to the
     messages in a full-screen editor,  and then send off my  replies.
     Total  connect  time should only be a few minutes.

          Until DUTCHIE this has been an empty dream because few users
     were willing to set up a complete BBS system or  buy  a  copy  of
     SEAdog.  While  DUTCHIE is far from a full SEAdog,  it is free to
     private individuals and will do what is  necessary  for  a  point
     with a minimum of overhead (disk space, installation time, etc.).

          The requirements  for DUTCHIE  aren't that hard to meet. All
     you need is an IBM PC or compatible with 512K of RAM and at least
     2 floppy  drives (a  hard drive  with at least one floppy is even
     better). The BBS that will  serve  you  (your  boss  node  in the
     DUTCHIE terminology)  needs to be running SEAdog, Opus, Fido or a
     combination  of  these  programs.   Best  service   is  currently
     available through  a BBS  that is  running SEAdog in front of the
     bulletin board all day, although Opus  version 1.0  is rumored to
     work  just  as  well.  You'll  also need a FOSSIL driver, the two
     currently supported are Bob  Hartman's Opus!Comm  and Ray Gwinn's
     X00.SYS (version 1.02 or higher). Henk recommends X00.SYS because
     of  the multiple COM port support and baud rates up to 9600 baud.
     The boss node will have to run a program called BRINKERS at least
     once a day.  BRINKERS is the program that makes it  possible  for
     the  bulletin  board  to  support points.  If you want any of the
     echomail conferences sent to you,  the echomail programs are also
     required. At the end of this column I'll give everyone a complete
     list of the files I have and where they can be obtained.

          Describing  DUTCHIE  is  going   to  be   very  easy.  After
     FidoNews 4-20                Page 23                  24 May 1987


     installing  it  on  your  system (we'll assume that you've worked
     everything out with your boss node) you tell DUTCHIE to  poll the
     boss. DUTCHIE  will take  over for  awhile as  it attempts to get
     through to the boss. If your boss isn't running SEAdog 4.0 with a
     BBS  mail  event  all  day,  you will probably have to leave your
     system on all night to call  the boss  during National  Mail Hour
     (09:00 GMT  for the  US, currently  5:00 for  me). If the boss is
     running OPUS version 0 you can always drop off your messages, but
     will only  be able  to pick  up messages  when he is running FIDO
     (during NMH). Hopefully Opus  version  1.0  will  allow  the same
     thing and  make things  easier for  you and  your boss node.

          Once  DUTCHIE has gotten your messages (and you've processed
     any echomail conferences that are being  sent  to  you)  you  can
     spend  all  the  time  you need OFF-LINE to read and reply to the
     messages.  Once you're done you can send off your replies to  the
     boss  (if  he's running SEAdog or Opus).  Things are a lot easier
     for you because you finally have a full screen  editor,  no  more
     messing  around  with  Fido's line oriented editor.  You also can
     reply to a message using the ">" form easier,  this means copying
     parts  of  the old message into your reply with the ">" symbol in
     front of each line from the old message.  I first ran  into  this
     form of a reply on Usenet,  and it does make a series of messages
     a lot easier to read.  That's all there is to using DUTCHIE as  a
     point.

          You have  no need  for the  nodelist (unless  you want it to
     send netmail to nodes other than the boss) which is  getting very
     large. Since  your boss  is the  only one  who needs to know your
     phone number (in some cases he may even call you regularly!), you
     DO NOT have to be running a bulletin board. Other points can send
     mail to you merely by knowing your point address (it will be sent
     through your  boss node), and your sysop can probably make a list
     of his points available. You are not listed  in the international
     nodelist, and  the only  arrangements to make are between you and
     the boss node  (although  you'll  probably  want  anyone  who you
     converse  with  regularly  to  know  your point address). You can
     bring all of this up slowly. First only a few local messages with
     everyone  having  to  know  your  point  address.  Once  you  get
     comfortable  with  that,  maybe   a  few   echomail  conferences.
     Hopefully, one day you'll decide that you want the whole nodelist
     and become involved with  people all  over the  world through the
     network.

          This is somewhat shortened, as I had originally written over
     five pages on DUTCHIE and could easily write a small  book on it.
     If you're  interested in  what it  can do  for you, I suggest you
     obtain the software from a list of boards at the  bottom and make
     arrangements with  your sysop  if you wish to become a point. Any
     sysops who  have a  large number  of people  reading the echomail
     conferences  would  be  well  advised  to  look  into the idea of
     setting up some of their users  as points  (I happen  to like the
     idea of  points, okay?).  It could really help free up your board
     and your time to helping out newcomers to  BBSing while providing
     better service to your more experienced users.

          Instead of looking at a game I've found enjoyable, I'm going
     to give you the update on my valspeak/LEX  project as  I promised
     last week.  Two weeks  ago I  mentioned a  program I'd gotten off
     Usenet that would "translate" an ASCII text file into something a
     little different. The something a little different being the type
     of speech that Hollywood wants  us  to  think  is  used  all over
     Southern  California's valleys (eg.  "Gag me with a spoon").  The
     source code needed to be run through a program called LEX,  which
     generates C source code.  I had found a LEX, but it wasn't enough
     like the Unix  version  and  I  had  been  having  some  problems
     converting  it.  I  checked  with  the system administrator on my
     local Unix machine on running valspeak.l (the distributed  source
     code)  through the Unix machine's LEX,  downloading the generated
     code,  and compiling it on my PC.  He agreed that it was  a  good
     idea,  unfortunately  it  would violate their license agreements.
     I've been trying to convert the source code to my LEX with little
     luck.  If anyone out there knows of a near perfect implementation
     of  the  Unix LEX program for the PC,  please let me know where I
     can obtain it.  A version that has been tested with  Microsoft  C
     version 4.0 would be greatly preferred.

          I've also bought what many consider to be THE reference book
     on C. It's "The C Programming Language" by Brian W. Kernigham and
     Dennis M. Ritchie (Prentice-Hall, list price $26.67). If you hear
     people referring  to K&R, this is the book they're talking about.
     It is a basic introduction and  overview to  the C  language, and
     I've been  using it  as a  reference book. It documents the early
     standard that the ANSI draft is based on, and covers  most of the
     topics needed  to understand  C. There are numerous examples of C
     code, and  more than  enough exercises.  I've heard  a rumor that
     there is  a book that gives answers to all the exercises and will
     attempt to follow up on the lead. It is not  really aimed  at the
     person new  to computers,  but should  work adequately for anyone
     familiar with programming  and  is  willing  to  spend  some time
     actually doing the exercises.

          Once  again  I  welcome  your comments and suggestions on my
     column.  Below  you'll  find  my  FidoNet  net/node  number, uucp
     address, and US mail address. FidoNet people should route mail to
     me through 157/0, or 157/1. 157/1 is preferable because I  hit it
     more often  each day.  Below the addresses is the list of DUTCHIE
     files and where they can be file-requested.

                    Needed for sysops supporting DUTCHIE points

     All of these files should be available from  157/46 (where  I got
     them), 2/1  and 3/1.  Other places  may have  them as well (157/1
     should also have it). Keep in  mind  you'll  also  need  a FOSSIL
     driver, be it Opus!Comm or X00.SYS.

     These  ballots  will  be counted by myself since with 200 members

     made  available  to  anyone wishing to insure that their vote was
     included.

                               Thank You
