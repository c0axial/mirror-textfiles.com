Editorial: Vote for me!

by Tom Jennings (1:1/1)

Well, I was overtaken by enthusiasm, actually, there's nothing I
want to run for. Oh well.

In this issue I've included a news release by someone running for U.S.
Congress, knowing that it's mainly of local interest, and obviously
U.S.-only. For a couple of reasons.

One, I know Glen Tenney; he's the person behind (amongst other things)
the annual Hackers Convention. He works hard, a good organizer
(including knowing when to not mess), and a non-control freak. Utmost
technical talent combined with a good grasp of social realities (an
all too rare combination).

Two, his ideas, particularly how he would connect to the less than
wholesome political landscape, are worth looking at. This is what's
possible, and not just beneficial to us techies.

Lastly, it's reasonably short, and there aren't any humongous articles
this week to compete with.

If nothing else, you should bug your local hired thugs about the stuff
Glenney is more than willing to address. Make those worthless
#)$_(_*$#% earn their graft!




PS: Are there any FidoNet-specific newsletters in other FidoNet zones?
Or have most of them burned up in the flames leaking out of z2?

PPS: Coming soon to a disk-space near you: famous FidoNet
personalities get outed!

PPPS: Ditto: review of an excellent book on online resources for free
or cheap.

MARCH 6, 1992, SAN MATEO, CALIFORNIA: Progress begins with initiative, a
coming together of a vision and the will to accomplish great things.
Silicon Valley entrepreneurs know this very well. For too long, career
politicians have laid barriers in the way of people working to build a
humane, viable future with the tools that technology has given them.
When the people have asked for widespread access to telecommunications,
computing power, and education, old-school politicians have pointed to
the necessity for defense spending instead of making investments in the
future. That's why I'm announcing my candidacy for the U.S. House of
Representatives in the reapportioned twelfth Congressional District of
California. My district covers most of the area from San Mateo up to
Golden Gate Park in San Francisco. As a Democrat, I will be challenging
our twelve year incumbent in the June Primary.

A few weeks ago I asked Congressman Tom Lantos' staff how he voted last
year. Their initial response was to hand me the glossy advertising
brochure that our tax dollars paid for. When pressed to find out how he
voted, or didn't vote, I was ushered into their library, shown to the
Congressional Record, and told to look it up myself day by day. This is
how my representative, from one of the most technologically advanced
districts, brings information to his constituents. Career politicians
have remained dedicated to high defense spending while the real tools
needed for worldwide economic competition are lying dormant. We need to
encourage the young, trained minds of our country, and to provide the
communications power to unleash that talent.

FidoNews 9-11                  Page 3                      16 Mar 1992


Every day we are faced with non-technical problems such as health
insurance, jobs, and our economy, but I feel very strongly that our
country needs to look at the future of technology: how it can be used or
abused, and how it is abusing all of us. Technology is advancing far
faster than our laws can cope, which raises many legal, sociological,
ethical, and constitutional questions. Answering these questions
requires both an understanding of the technology and actual experiences
with the technology.

Our greatest resources for the future are our children and our world.
Our country needs to take a proactive role in producing the best
educated future generation that we can, as well as having a place for
that generation to live and be productive. We need to find innovative
and creative ways to put technology to work for our future rather than
putting up legislative roadblocks to the future. Providing the
information and education we and our children need to be competitive in
the future is coupled to our economy. We can't be productive today, nor
can our children compete in the future, without information and
education. We must plan for the twenty-first century today.

We are faced with a society of economic haves and have-nots. Most of us
actively involved with technology and information access know that
information is power. We are fast becoming a nation of information
"knows" and "know-nots", and those who do not have the information will
be in an even more devastating position than those who are just
economically disadvantaged. Our government itself works to keep
information unavailable to us. We need to bring information to the
people, and get information from the people to our elected officials.
This will help bring the power back to the people. You can be an elected
official without being a career politician, but you can't legislate
technological issues unless you understand the technology. We need
elected officials who are online and accessible, and with whom
information flows -- to them and from them as a dialogue.

One of the problems of our political system is that it takes money to
win. Too often these funds come from Political Action Committees. The
traditional view has been that campaign funding is spent to "get the
message out". The online community finally has a chance to use this new
medium to not only get a message out, but to discuss the issues without
spending obscene amounts of money. Let's use my campaign as a
demonstration of the power of online politics. Pass this release and my
platform on to your friends and colleagues, and around your town. Even
though California's twelfth Congressional District covers the area from
San Mateo up to Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, these issues need to
be discussed online and in the media nationwide. We of the online
community are currently an under-represented constituency. Let's change
that. Let's get Congress online.

Even an online campaign isn't free. Network etiquette precludes me from
asking for campaign contributions, but please do contact me directly:

Congressional Candidate Glenn Tenney's Platform For Our Future

 MARCH 6, 1992, SAN MATEO, CALIFORNIA: Most candidates look like every
other candidate on most issues. I am differentiated on high-tech issues.
Here's how I feel about a few traditional and technological issues:

* We need to be competitive in the "global village" world economy, to
focus on America without being protectionist. Education and information
are keys to achieving these goals.

* Our country, from the top down, needs to look years into the future
instead of just months. Our country and our businesses also need to
understand that our people are our major asset for the future. We must
rescue our environment to have a future.

* Being in business for myself, not being wealthy, and having raised
five boys means that my wife and I live the health care problem daily. A
tax credit next year doesnUt help us pay our insurance premium next
month, let alone help us find insurance. Our country must commit to
defining and providing a minimal level of health care to everyone.

* When my wife and I decided to become parents we fortunately had access
to all the information and options, and had the right to a choice. I am
pro-family and pro-choice.

* Recent events in what was the Soviet Union offers us the opportunity
of our lifetime to take dramatic steps towards world peace, and a true
peace-time economy. We must significantly reduce our defense budget
while helping defense businesses and their workers transition to non-
defense ventures. Our country's enormous supply of talent currently
committed to defense-related projects can be put to effective and
innovative use in solving many other problems. We can do this and
maintain defensive strength.

* We must encourage businesses to invest in our future both by reducing
long term capital gains taxes (for capital that is actually a long term
investment in our future) and providing tax incentives for research and
development. Having participated in chip designs, and seeing how
biotechnology is progressing, I know that many innovations require a
large long-term capital investment.

FidoNews 9-11                  Page 5                      16 Mar 1992


* There are tremendous changes waiting to happen if only we can provide
high-speed computer and data networks between our universities, public
schools (K-12) and homes. We need to take steps to wire our country for
Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) or 'fiber to the home.'
Affordable ubiquitous networked computing will have an effect that can
hardly be imagined by those outside of the field.

* Most people get their news from television. About two- thirds of our
homes receive that news on cable TV, yet only a small number of
companies choose what channels are available. Cable TV affords us many
advantages, yet like all technologies it is a double edged sword. We
need policies that better deal with these "monopolies", and which
provide for true competition.

* Technology is encroaching more and more into our everyday life, and
abusing our privacy along the way. These issues hit all of us when
applying for credit, going to the doctor, applying for a job, and even
when making an 800 toll-free phone call. For example, there are
companies providing computers to doctors' offices in exchange for access
to all of their records. These problems are affecting everyone, and are
not esoteric technological issues. I am committed to protecting our
privacy at home and on the job.

* The computer networks criss-crossing our country are the highways of
tomorrow. These networks are an 'online electronic frontier' connecting
such diverse groups as a Native American Tribal school with an M.I.T.
mathematics class. The electronic frontier is a new publishing medium,
and a new 'place' of assembly raising many issues of privacy and rights
of free speech. Online we can achieve what political consultants want: a
way to get a message to many people. A key element of being online is
that the people can also get their message TO their representatives.
This technology affords us the opportunity to discuss issues with our
representatives.

* We need ready access to information, especially flowing to and from
our government at all levels. Information is power, and we the people
must recapture the power that should be ours.

Congressional Candidate Glenn Tenney Talks a Bit About Himself

MARCH 6, 1992, SAN MATEO, CALIFORNIA: I've never had a desire to be a
career politician. Apparently, few politicians in recent times have
carried a vision to Washington. That's why I have decided to act on my
vision of our country's future in the twenty- first century by working
with you, as your representative in Washington.

My vision sees an information revolution that has already started and
will be as dramatic as was the industrial revolution. We need
legislators who can truly understand future technologies and how to use
them to our advantage instead of having the technologies abuse us. I
take our future and my campaign seriously. I am compelled to help
prepare our country for the next century even if that means becoming an
elected official and putting my career on hold.

I've been professionally involved in various aspects of technologies
(software and hardware) having begun operating system and compiler
design some 28 years ago, even before graduating high school. I've been
"online" since then, being "hand's on" with technology having designed
and implemented many small and large systems as well as having
programmed on dozens of systems. I've also researched and written about
technology, and about people's fears of technology.

I've been self-employed (or a "high-tech entrepreneur", depending on how
you want to view it) since I formed my own company in 1974. Since then
I've been involved in a few Silicon Valley high-tech startups including
the very beginning of the personal computer industry, as well as chip
designs and a few others.

My company has been a "mom and pop" venture since Susan and I were
married in 1976. I have two children and three step- children. I grew up
in the Chicago area and moved to San Mateo county in 1972, raising our
children in San Mateo since 1976. I turned 43 years old the day after I
announced my candidacy.

The following are some important aspects of who I am...

BA in Management (with honors), Saint Mary's College of California.

Senior Member of the Institute for Electrical and Electronic Engineers
(IEEE), and member of the IEEE Computer Society.

Participating Member, IEEE USA Intellectual Property Committee (dealing
with employed inventors rights, and copyright/patent issues and
legislation).

Member of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).

Chairperson and Organizer of The Hackers Conference (an annual
International high-tech conference) since it was originated by Stewart
Brand of The Whole Earth Catalog.

Member of the program and organizing committee of the first Conference
on Computers, Freedom and Privacy held last year.

Former Member of the Board of Trustees, Peninsula Temple Beth El.

Licensed Amateur Radio Operator (a "ham", callsign AA6ER).

Licensed Private Pilot (single engine land, instrument rated).

I've also been President of a variety of local computer and amateur
radio groups, and I am still involved with these groups and many other
organizations.

        Changed procedures to get an echomail conference add to
the backbone.


        In an effort to make adding a conference to the backbone
both easier and more in the open the following procedures are
now put into place.  These modify slightly the procedures listed
in BOP 1.03.

        To get a new conference added to backbone distribution
the following steps must be followed.

        I.  The moderator of the conference must place a message
in the ZEC conference addressed to: Backbone

                a.  Please note any netmail requests will be
ignored. Only messages placed in the ZEC conference will be
considered valid requests.

FidoNews 9-11                  Page 8                      16 Mar 1992


                b.  The message must include either the
appropriate line from your areas.bbs or a list of fidonet
addresses that currently receive the conference.  (If a list of
nodes is included it would be more accurate to gather this from
originating messages in the conference than from $eenbys or path
lines) This is to demonstrate wide spread interest in your
conference and your current distribution.

                c.  The rest of the message should just be a
request to have the message added to backbone distribution. (A
sample message follows).

        II.  The same time the request message is posted a copy
of the Elist confirmation message (minus password of course)
should also be posted.  If your conference has been in the Elist
for some time and the listing is current, then just post the
Elist section that covers your conference.  (In other words cut
and paste a message made up of the elist listing)  If your
conference is not currently Elisted or if you have not received
a confirmation message... DO NOT post a request message.

        Any request message that does not have the required
Elist message as outlined above will not be considered a valid
request and will be ignored.

        III.  Two RECs must also request that the conference be
added.  Those requests will also be posted in the ZEC
conference.  Please note.... The request to the RECs MUST come
from Nodes within their regions asking to have the conference
added to the backbone.  Those requests must be via netmail to
the REC or in a regional sysop echo to the REC and most RECs
require that requests come from at least two different nets.
Moderators please DO NOT send messages to the RECs as they will
probably be ignored.  The requests must come from nodes within
their regions.

        Once the above requirements have been met the conference
will be added with the next Fidonet.NA.  An REC (currently Dan
Buda) will monitor the ZEC conference and track all messages
addressed to Backbone.  That REC will maintain Fidostat.NA
tracking the requirements for each requested conference.
Fidostat.NA will be posted in the ZEC conference each Friday.
John Souvestre will hatch both Fidostat.NA and Fidonet.NA out
each Friday night.

        Please consider this a request to add MULT-SCLEROSIS to
the backbone for distribution.

        Current known distribution.

JOURNAL Echo
Jeff Murphy, 1:280/32, bbs hrs 8pm-8am

JOURNAL is an echo designed for the historian and genealogist.  If
you like true stories about real people, this may be the one for
you.  If you or your users liked the Little House series, you will
enjoy JOURNAL.

Called Pioneer Journals and Diaries, the conference contains entries
from original pioneer diaries and journals, as well as letters or
other documents of historical interest.

Users are invited to enter the contents of an original journal or
diary.  To give a feel for the day-to-day lives of the people
involved, and what they went through, we are entering a day or two
of their diary at a time.

FidoNews 9-11                  Page 11                     16 Mar 1992


Currently I am posting the diary of Lydia Allen Rudd, a woman who
crossed the Oregon Trail in 1852.  Here is a recent entry:

Re: Diary of Lydia Allen Rudd, 1852

May 8...  We have come about 12 miles and were obliged to camp in
the open prarie without any wood  Mary and myself collected some dry
weeds and grass and made a little fire and cooked some meat and the
last of our supply of eggs with these and some hard bread with water
we made our supper.

If you would like to have this echo, please contact your REC and
request that it be added to the backbone.  Currently sysops are
calling from Fort McMurray, Alberta, Las Vegas, NV, and Sebring, FL
to pick up the echo.  If you would like to poll for it on an
occasional basis until it becomes available,  please contact John
Schnake at 1:280/9 for a high-speed feed.  Current volume is 15

Sierra Club Echo (SIERRAN) Hits Backbone

In the event you have not checked your "in" box for the new and
improved FiDOSTAT.NA, (or even if you have) I thought I would be
sure and mention here in the Snooze that the Sierra Club Echo is
now being moved around by the Fidonet Backbone!

I would like to publicly thank Mike Ernst of 3812/215 (my long
distance EC) for making the echo available to those brave souls
who have made special trips to Texas to pick up the echo.  It is
not every echomail hub who is willing to be the pickup point of
any and all who send him netmail.

While the Sierra Club Echo (SIERRAN) may be geared for members and
friends of the Sierra Club, anyone sharing a desire to change our
environment for the better is more than welcome!
