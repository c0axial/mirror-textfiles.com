     =================================================================
                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================


     One of our readers takes the size of FidoNews to task in this Issue.

     He doesn't say how long he's been around but only refers to the output
     of Tees, the previous Editor as example of FidoNews size past.

     Since Tees didn't bother to actively edit FidoNews many times, it's
     hardly surprising many of his Issues were miniscule or Editorial only
     phosphor padding.

     FidoNews has been all sizes the past 13 years from 5K to 157K. Does it
     really matter how big an Issue is uncompressed? Nobody has to read it;
     part or all of it. Those who enjoy FidoNews for its potential [like
     myself] make contributions to it to make it fun or useful. The History
     and Standards series is part of what FidoNet is and many newbies and
     Echomail weenies [those who only joined FidoNet for Echomail and don't
     care or understand FidoNet's purpose] have never been exposed to this
     material. It's FidoEducational. That's why it's here and why it's
     going to keep going this way. There are FIVE FSCs in this Issue.
     There are only sixty or so more to go. [grin]

     The software list is also an important part of the FidoNews mission
     and we all are indebted to Peter Popovich for the Herculean labors he
     has made in organizing and maintaining that list. {Thanks, Peter!} In
     these days of uncertified mailers and tossers giving headaches to the
     entire Network from time to time, it's good to know what is available
     and what does work. Even as many of the Echomail weenies flee FidoNet
     for the apparently greener pastures of Internet mailing lists, there
     are still BBS Sysops who need to know what is available for them if
     they want to put up a system and become part of the World's First and
     Largest Amateur BBS Network [and no, Bob, you don't have to run a BBS
     to be a FidoNet Sysop]. It serves a purpose. It's in every Issue
     because any one Issue may be the only one somebody sees.

     There's an old saying that I don't agree with about doing and
     teaching. It sez that those who can, do, and those who can't, teach.
     That is incorrect. Those who can, do AND teach. Those who can't, get
     jobs as critics. I'm doing and teaching. The lessons may be taken or
     left at the reader's discretion. [grin]

     Speaking of 'otherNets'[tm], it appears that the first major splinter
     groups that broke from FidoNet to start true Utopian networks [cough]
     have died from lack of interest or commitment. The first to go off was
     AlterNet and it stopped publishing a nodelist as of Julian 010 this
     year. You had to pay a tithe to belong to that one. It was the first
     sourgrapesnet[r]. The second to splinter was EggNet. It didn't cost
     anything but it was going to provide all the democratic ideals FidoNet
     didn't. They even had a Supreme Court. It stopped publishing last year
     as of Julian 138. Ten years ago, I told you so.

     There never was any good reason for 'otherNets'[tm]. They were all
     ego-driven fantasies of 'the way a network should be operated' when
     FIDONEWS 14-05               Page 2                    3 Feb 1997


     FidoNet didn't move fast enough to suit them. Now, there are bunches
     of them. Most of those are Echomail driven which was also unnecessary.
     Several of those foolishly used Zone numbers under 10. That was very
     short-sighted. FidoNet is bound to expand into those Zone numbers and
     a lot of folks in 'otherNets'[tm] are going to start whining about
     overlap and 2D addressing that can't tell one Zone's Nodes from
     another. Boohoo. If they have any sense, they will shift up to Zone
     numbers unlikely to be overrun by FidoNet Zones when expansion takes
     place. With the demise of AlterNet's deliberate use of Zone 7, that
     will be one less group of whiners to hear from. [grin]

     Okay, that should generate some input. Those who complain about
     FidoNews content should remember that THEY are dictating the content
     with THEIR contributions. If they make none, their griping is
     hollow. Those who can, DO. [chuckle]

     C.B.

     The secret is out! I just happen to catch the above URL on the #linux
     channel of Undernet IRC, which points to OpenDOS!  Let's let it speak
     for itself, here are some blurbs:


                                     Caldera OpenDOS

        Caldera OpenDOS 7.0 is based on the Novell DOS 7.0 DOS operating
        system, and expands on some of Novell's DOS' strengths.

         OpenDOS:

          * A genuine DOS (100% compatible)
          * A Rommable DOS - designed from the start to execute out of ROM
          * Fully featured - A comprehensive DOS utility set
          * Complete with extensions - including drivers for CD-ROMs etc.
          * Genuine multi-tasking, with API for developers
          * Includes 286 DPMS memory manager in addition to DPMI
          * Comprehensive Networking Client solution, NetWare 3.X, 4.X and
            Personal NetWare
          * Includes PC-based Personal NetWare Server
          * Includes defacto Disk compression - STAC
          * Includes new NetWars 2.0 network game

         Availability

        For private/evaluation and education use Caldera OpenDOS is
        available for download from Calderas Web site - to [1]Download

                        Caldera OpenDOS Programming Documentation

        Caldera OpenDOS 7.0 is a complete DOS operating system.
     FIDONEWS 14-05               Page 4                    3 Feb 1997


        Consequently you can use all the available DOS development tools
        for the platform, allowing creation of software that will run on
        Caldera OpenDOS, MS-DOS, and DR DOS versions. In addition Caldera
        OpenDOS provides extensions that allow your application greater
        flexibility.

         Example additional features include:

          * Multi-tasking

        Caldera OpenDOS provides a full multi-tasking environment on
        Pentium, 486, or 386-based harware. This is built into the memory
        management extensions provided in the operating system, and is
        accessible for standard un-aware applications when using the
        Taskmanager (Taskmgr) utility. Programs however can have direct
        access to create separate threads etc, via the extended Application
        Programming Interface.

          * DPMS

        A memory manager that even works on 286-based Pcs, allowing device
        drivers to reside outside of the regular DOS application area.
        Drivers or Terminate and stay resident applications can thereby
        avoid using valuable application memory,

          * Romming tools

        Caldera OpenDOS is the ideal embedded DOS system, designed for
        straightforward out-of-the-box romming. Caldera will also be making
        these tools available for prototyping embedded systems. If you wish
        to use Caldera OpenDOS in your embedded application contact Caldera
        Sales for more information

        Caldera Inc. today shipped Caldera OpenDOS 7.01. OpenDOS is the
        first Caldera Release of DOS, based on the Novell DOS 7 technology
        acquired from Novell in 1996. The release is notable as it is the
        first commercial DOS Operating System to be downloadable from the
        Internet.  OpenDOS is a true DOS operating system, supporting all
        DOS applications including Microsoft Windows applications, and
        networking systems including Novell NetWare, Windows for
        Workgroups, and LANtastic.
     FIDONEWS 14-05               Page 5                    3 Feb 1997


        Caldera OpenDOS comes complete with comprehensive networkability.
        The inclusion of Novell Personal NetWare means that OpenDOS fulfils
        all DOS workgroup requirements. End-users can easily network their
        PCs.  It even includes a brand-new version of the NetWars Arcade
        game for single or multiuser use.

        "OpenDOS underlines Calderas commitment to making essential
        technology openly available as widely as possible" commented Jon
        Williams, Director of Marketing of Caldera UK Ltd. "Non-commercial
        users can download the latest DOS direct from our Web site.
        Commercial users and OEMs can download the system for evaluation
        and easily test-integrate into their solutions"

        "Caldera OpenDOS 7.01 represents the first 're-generation' of DOS
        Operating Systems, with its particular suitability to specialist
        OEM applications" he continued (The DRDOS product line that OpenDOS
        is derived from was the first purposely ROMmable DOS with industry
        leading features like power management)

        Brian Sparks, President and CEO Caldera Inc. said "Caldera is
        working with the Internet community to make productive commercial
        systems as open and available as possible. Dependable and reliable
        commercial systems software such as OpenLinux and OpenDOS are
        enabling users to make affordable and open choices on which to base
        their business solutions."

        Caldera uses its own technological and marketing resources to
        leverage technologies including the Linux operating system created
        by independent developers worldwide, and the OpenDOS product range.

     Fidonews, The "lard ass" of newsletters
     by gary gilmore, 1:2410/400

     First off, let me say, I take nothing away from Chris on running
     Fidonews.  I know it's not easy to produce, and I know he's trying
     hard.  I didn't see a mass rush of people volunteering to take it
     over when Sylvia/Don gave it up.

     OK, enough of the prefacing... time to get out the axe. <grin>

     A few of the locals here were talking about Fidonews, and mentioning
     how much larger it's gotten... unfortunately, that's mostly due to
     a bunch of bloated junk that I'm willing to bet a majority doesn't
     care about.

     Just for the hell of it, I took this week's news and did a little
     slash and burn to it.

     FIDO1404.NWS   123592   01-27-97

     That's the whole enchilada, all the poop included.  Hefty, eh?
     Wait.. there's more.

     Lets remove the huge "how to get Fidonews from every place in
     the world that we know of & Internet addresses of those that
     can spell 'Fidonews'" listing, the "Jurassic park" section
     (those FTSC documents that were originally written on stone tablets
     by guys with modems that had tubes in them), and the oh-so-popular
     "All the software in the world that has the word "mail" somewhere
     in it's source code" segment, oh, I left in some "humor" <ahem>
     that probably managed to offend most everyone who might be a
     Fidonet sysop.  (Not only was that emailed to almost the entire
     world, it wasn't funny the first time I saw it.)

     FIDO1404.NWS    27118   1-28-97

     Whoops!  What happened?  Fidonews gets anorexic!

     Now again, I don't -really- want to bash the Snooze..  honest.
     I'm one of the few weirdos that actually bother reading it weekly.
     FIDONEWS 14-05               Page 7                    3 Feb 1997


     (Of course, I also like to read the nodelist now and then, so
     go figure...)

     Honestly though.. do we really need reprints of FTSC docs?  If
     someone wants them, there's many, many places that offer them
     up for reading.  Fer chrissakes, there's even a listing of the
     FTSC Internet site!  (Though where's the FIDOnet listing for it?)
     About the only people that DO want to read them are programmers,
     or those preparing to "go after someone" over some arcane
     specification.  Do we really need them in Fidonews?  I don't
     think so.  I'll betcha that most folks just PgDwn furiously past
     them.

     How about the giant PGP key?  Have we -really- had a huge problem
     in the past with "bogus" copies of Fidonews?  Oh please... I have
     to laugh just imagining some kiddies whipping out a Fidonews
     proclaiming himself the new International Coordinator or writing
     that Bruce Bodger and Bob Satti were seen on a plane with Bigfoot
     and Elvis, and that John Souvestre has moved in with Steve Winter.
     Bwaahahaha! :-)

     (Hmmm...  come to think of it, I think I'd -rather- read an issue
     like that...)

     Uhhh, I don't think there's much doubt on the "authenticity" of
     the Fidonews I get, so I don't think we need to bloat with a
     huge key in every issue.  Hell, just use AV mode when you Zip it
     up... that'll do nicely.  (Oh, gahead... tell me how you can crack
     a zip password... yep, I'll bet there's LOTS of people dying to do
     that with Fidonews too! <laugh>)

     Today in history... umm, do I -really- need to know what's happening
     in 2000?  Do I care?  Should I jot it down in my Dayrunner?
     OK, ok... whatever, but how about limiting it to 6mo in advance?
     That's fair.  Oh, and while we're at it, how about something like
     "Zone 1 Mail hour changes for areas observing Daylight Savings
     Time"... or something that REALLY would be helpful/matters to the
     Fidonet sysop.  Ain't this "FIDOnews"?

     Peter E. Popovich.. bless him.  Nice guy.  But do we -really- need
     him to go to all the trouble of submitting this encyclopedia-sized
     listing each and every week?  C'mon, some of this software hasn't
     been updated in four -years-, so why not just let Peter send in one
     listing every four -weeks-.  I think that's fair, and gives Peter
     some rest.

     Jim Henry..  Hey!  Here's a guy in FIDOnews talking about FIDOnet!
     Imagine!  Hurrah for Jim!  I don't own a palmtop, but I might just
     turn his echo for being one of the FEW things in this issue that is
     FIDOnet related, not INTERnet.

     Oh, Internet?  Geez, hey, you forgot to list that our net's home page
     also has a link to Fidonews.  Oh, and Infoseek?  I'll also find the
     phrase "Fidonews" too, so let's not leave them out..

     (Get the idea?)  Auugh!  Do I -have- to be told each and every place
     FIDONEWS 14-05               Page 8                    3 Feb 1997


     in the galaxy that I can find Fidonews, or each place that has
     another dreary all-black "Fidonet" web page? (Hmm, is that an
     oxymoron? "Fidonet web page"?) Doesn't POLICY4 (you know, it relates
     to FIDOnet) say that my NC has to give me Fidonews if I want it?
     (Well, I -am- the NC here, but you know what I'm saying..)  I notice
     that of all the junk about where I can get Fidonews, I don't see one
     mention of the -main- way to get it... the FIDONEWS file echo.
     <knock knock>  Hello?  Anyone there?

     Sheesh, do we have an Internet boner or what?

     I think there's also something inherently wrong with FIDOnews in
     HTML format.  I dunno, but all this Internet all over FIDOnet makes
     me itch.  Umm, it happens to be that beloved Internet that's
     shrinking our ranks, for the most part.

     Is it too much to ask that FIDOnews do more coverage of FIDOnet, and
     -not- the Internet?  If it doesn't, lets just change the name of it
     to INTERnews, and be done with it.  After all, it -does- say "The
     newsletter of the FidoNet community", doesn't it?  <sigh>

     Sure, many want to put Internet features in their BBS systems.
     That's great.  Keeping up on the bleeding edge of technology and all,
     but where's the "how to gate newsgroups into your Fidonet BBS"
     articles, or "How to gate email into your Fidonet BBS"... (note that
     I say "into your Fidonet BBS" a lot there... that's because it's
     what Fidonews should be concerned about.

     What's the point of this behemoth article?  Simple.  A little less
     INTERnet in my FIDOnews, please.  A little less rehashing of old
     crap, and ancient postings.  (I'll also kill you if you post more
     damned childlike ASCII "artwork"... Christ, that's so lame.  My
     cat's litterbox has better artwork in it.)  A little less bloat and
     needless information, and more FIDO-related meat in the S'nooze,
     please.

     If this means some issues will be slim, then so be it.  No problem.
     Donald Tees had some issues that were nothing more than an editorial,
     but know what?  They were -good- editorials, and worth reading.
     At least he didn't include reprints of "My favorite nodediffs from
     1988-1990" just to keep the size up.  Let it be what it will be,
     and let it be FIDOnet related first and foremost.

     Again, I like Fidonews, and I hope no one will be offended by all
     this rambling.  If you are, well, go read "The history of nodelist
     flags in Guam and Easter Island" for a while until you get over it.
     (Or wait until it's reprinted in Fidonews. <laugh>)

     As they say, "Flames>nul".  :-)

     Synopsis

       This started as a reverse-engineered technical description of the
       core operations of Ron Bemis' Flea program, and an attempt to
       formulate a new specification which is a more symmetric superset
       of that functionality.  Specifications for Mr. Bemis software is
       available with that software, which is not freely distributed.

       This document ONLY addresses the format of files transferred
       between systems.  It does not address configuration information,
       which is really an implementation specific issue.

       This is currently only a base for discussion, which should be
       carried on in the SOFTWARE (SDS) and FTSC conferences.

     Distribution

       This document may be freely distributed, so long as it is
       complete.

     1  General

     1.1  Existing Tools

     1.1.1  FileFwd
     FIDONEWS 14-05               Page 10                   3 Feb 1997


       FileFwd is a program by Joe Keenan whose primary purpose is to
       move consistently named files on a routed, regular basis.  It is
       extremely useful for routing echomail packets through intermediate
       nodes without unpacking and re-packing at each of the stations.

     1.1.2  Flea

       Flea is a program created by Ron Bemis which is used to broadcast
       files in a manner similar to EchoMail.  It is the primary tool
       used by the FidoNet Software Distribution System.

       Specifications for the Flea program are ostensibly available from
       the author.

     1.1.3  GlueFwd

       GlueFwd is a distributed document control system from Greylock
       Software that was considered and rejected for use by the FidoNet
       Software Distribution System.

       Unlike Flea and Tick, GlueFwd uses messages to contain the
       associated routing information.

     1.1.4  Tick

       Tick is a program by Barry Geller, which performs approximately
       the same functions as Flea, but uses a unique associated
       information file format.

     1.2  Basics

     1.2.1  Associated Routing Information

       There are a number of problems associated with file routing,
       either point to point, or broadcast.  The basic problem is how to
       handle the associated routing information.  The approaches involve
       a spectrum ranging from information contained ONLY on the systems
       handling the files to carrying the information WITH the files
       being handled.

       In addition, there is the choice of how this information is to be
       conveyed.  The choices range from associated files, to messages.

     1.2.2  Name Collisions

     1.2.3  Larva - starting the process

       The "Larva" process is usually invoked by the user at the command
       line.  This is how a file is put in motion.  It creates the
       appropriate outbound .Fle files and the file attach information
       required by the given mailer environment.

     1.2.4  Flea - moving stuff along

       The "Flea" process is the one that moves the files along.  It does
       the following:
     FIDONEWS 14-05               Page 11                   3 Feb 1997


       Check the inbound for .Pre file, and process any that are
       releasable as you would a normal .Fle file

       Check the inbound for .Fle files, and process each as follows:

       Parse the .Fle file, making sure its associate file exists, it
       comes from a valid source, and that it is not a pre-release.  If
       any of those conditions are violated, the file is renamed either
       to .Bad or .Pre.

       If all is well, move the file to the appropriate path associated
       with the area, and, if possible, update the FILES.BBS file.

       Using a Larva-like process, send the file along to any nodes in
       your echo list that have not seen the file.

       A Flea process is generally run whenever inbound mail is received.

     1.3  Nomenclature

     1.3.1  [Required]

     1.3.2  {Optional}

     1.3.3  Address: {Domain>}{Zone:}Net/Node{.Point}

       In the context of Flea 2.x, only Net/Node style addressing is
       supported.

     1.3.4  Dates


     2  New Forwarding Format (TICK)

     2.1  General Goals

     2.1.1   Removing order dependency

       The current structure of .Fle files is very order dependent.  In
       some cases, .Fle file lines have verbs, in others, they do not.
       Presumably, Flea proper will have problems processing lines beyond
       the description that are not in the proper order.

       This weakness should be eliminated, essentially by insisting on a
       verb per line, which makes possible free-form parsing, eliminating
       order dependency.  Within some groups of entries with the same
       verb, order dependency may be required.

     2.1.2   Limiting the type of information contained in a given datum

       Flea 2.x very often carries different types of information on a
       given line.  While on the surface, this seems like an economical
       way to do things, it can lead to complications later on.

       Therefore, it is a general design goal to keep the type and use of
       a given datum associated with a given verb very clean.
     FIDONEWS 14-05               Page 12                   3 Feb 1997


     2.1.3   Removing Case Sensitivity

       Flea is currently very case sensitive.  Software should be soft.

       An argument has been made that case sensitivity is a protection
       against bad files being inserted into the system.  If someone
       wants to generate a trojan horse, they will need passwords (the
       primary protection), and in all likelihood would use some sort of
       Larval tool to generate it anyway.  Case sensitivity makes it
       slightly more difficult for a developer to "enter the fray".

     2.1.4   Removing Inconsistent Colon Usage

       Flea currently is haphazard in its usage of colons after verbs.
       Colons should be made optional (or eliminated) on all verbs.

     2.1.5   Optional Multiple DESC lines

       Flea currently supports a single description line, which is
       additionally position sensitive.  By creating a DESC verb, the
       position sensitivity can be eliminated, and multiple DESC lines
       can optionally be supported.

       At the current time, .Tic files use the DESC verb, but multiple
       DESC lines are not permitted.  Minimal compliance will be to
       handle one; multiple lines will be addressed later.

     2.1.6   App (Application) line support

       In general, all mechanisms in FidoNet should allow for
       growth/variation by other developers in a non-harmful manner.

       In the case of Flea routing files, an APP verb with non-specific
       data should be provided for.  For example, let's assume that UPCL
       supports some sort of a "return receipt" functionality - when a
       file hits you, so long as it's posted to your area, and with the
       sysop's consent (in the form of a configuration option), a message
       is sent to the Origin node.

       This might be done as follows:

       APP GREYLOCK Return-Receipt

       The "Greylock" sub-verb would keep APP conflicts from occurring.

       Processors other than UPCL would pass the line through to any
       rebroadcast .Tic files intact.  (In fact, so would UPCL.)

       App lines, taken as a group, are order dependent.  A Tick
       processor should output App lines created during forwarding in the
       same order they read them, and if a Tick processor creates new App
       lines, they should be added to the end of the existing App line
       list.

       Once the majority of processors support a given APP functionality,
       it might be moved to the spec proper.
     FIDONEWS 14-05               Page 13                   3 Feb 1997


       Indeed, any lines with "unrecognized verbs" should be passed
       through intact, and in the order encountered.

     2.1.7   Use of PATH construct rather than sby kludge

       Seenby information is more easily digested by humans (and
       programs) if it is sorted.  Unfortunately, such sorting removes
       the ability to use it for both seenby, and path information as it
       is in Flea 2.2.  In addition, the mechanism used by Flea 2.2
       precludes tiny seenby's, or Zone gating.

       Therefore, a PATH construct, much like an EchoMail PATH line
       should be used, instead of the current mechanism.  Once again,
       order dependency should be discouraged.  Within a group of path
       lines, obviously, order is important.

     2.1.8   Multiple Sby's per Sby line

       The current seen-by construct, with one seenby per line, with the
       word seen-by required on each line is hideously inefficient.

       This should be changed to mimic echomail's seen-by handling, where
       multiple seenby's are contained on each line, up to 78 or so
       characters worth.

       A possible reason to keep the seenby down to a single entry per
       line is if information on how and when that node got the file is
       to be included.  While this might be worth considering, it will
       add considerable weight to the .Fle file.

       At the current time, Tick files are assumed to have one seen-by
       per line.

     2.1.9   Full (Optional) Domain, Zone, and Point support

       In order to allow for the future growth of the network, and
       interactions with other networks, addresses should be able to
       contain a fully qualified FidoNet address:

           Domain>Zone:Net/Node.Point.

       Further, given that many authors' primary machines are points, the
       result is as shown in the sample above: completely unknown
       addresses appearing in the .Fle files.

       Of course, these should not be required, but used as necessary.

       At the current time, Domains are completely unsupported, and
       should not be used.

     2.1.10  Different extensions to avoid problems with Opus Style
     Outbound

       The extension .Fle was chosen because it leads to some expedient
       side effects in the form of file truncation/elimination by Opus or
       Binkley when the files reside in the outbound directory.
     FIDONEWS 14-05               Page 14                   3 Feb 1997


       On the other hand, both Opus and Binkley explicitly specify their
       outbound areas should be used ONLY for that.  A number of
       Binkley/Opus developers have expressed concern with this problem.

       For this, and other reasons, .Fle files should be given a new
       extension of some sort, one that is not closely related to the
       commonly used routing/message file extensions.  In addition,
       rather than the three divergent extensions now used by Flea (.Fle,
       .Bad, and .Pre), any and all extensions used by file routers based
       on this technology should use extensions that are more closely
       grouped.

       As an ancillary note, the FTSC should consider a "File
       Specification Pattern Registry".  This would not be limited to
       network tools, and it would not be an indication of ownership, it
       would simply be a reference.

     2.1.11  RFC-822 Format

       It might make some sense to consider using an RFC-822 compatible
       format for these files.  In a future version of this document,
       I'll detail this possibility.

       It would also be nice from the point of view of implementing a
       similar system on UseNet/Internet flavored systems.

     2.1.12  Valid pairing of associated info file and file proper

       We need a mechanism to insure that the primary file and the
       associated information file are a valid pairing.

       Consider the following scenario ...

       System allows overwrites.  A file and associated .Tic arrive.
       They are, for whatever reason, not processed.  A file by the same
       name comes in.  The pair is no longer valid, but given current
       technology, it would be passed along.

     2.2  Considerations

     2.2.1  Up and downness

     2.2.1.1  Single Uplink

     2.2.2  Table driven duplicate elimination

     2.2.3  Mapping between distribution and on-line organization

       There is a problem in the current implementation in that the local
       organization of a system tends to defeat the duplicate catching
       aspects of the system.

       I.E., the SDS currently sends out ALL FidoNet files in one
       "channel".  Many systems move files of this category or that to
       unique directories.

     FIDONEWS 14-05               Page 15                   3 Feb 1997


     2.2.4  Many features are intended for local optional implementation

       Many of the features in this specification obviously affect how
       individual sysops run their systems.  As such, these features
       should be optionally supported by each sysop, although the
       information should be passed through the associated information
       file regardless of whether or not they support the feature.

     2.3  Schematic of .Tic file

       {Path{:} [Address] {Address} ...}

       Note this file is NOT order dependent.  Some of the newer features
       are more for discussion than anything else.

     2.4  Nomenclature and Rules

     2.4.1  Address Format: Zone:Net/Node{.Point}

     2.4.2  Don't Barf on appended or unknown stuff

       Lines that are unrecognizable (i.e., non-existent or non-supported
       verbs) should be passed through untouched.

       Lines that have additional data beyond the required data
       (separated by whitespace) should not cause the system to fail,
       although it is obviously difficult to pass this information
       through.

     2.4.3  One or zero items of a given type unless otherwise specified

     2.4.4  Simple ASCII Alphabet

       All times are expressed as a long decimal in Unix format - the
       number of seconds since 1970.

     2.4.7  {Optional Data}

     2.5  Detail

     2.5.1   App [Ref] {Info}

       This is a "pass through" line to allow developers some room for
       development without breaking other developer's work.

       An APP line should have the following form:

         APP [AppRef] {App Information}

       or

         APPLICATION [AppRef] {App Information}

       Application lines should have their order preserved, and
       applications adding lines should do so at the end of the existing
       application list.

     2.5.2   Area [Name]

       Area names should probably be limited to 8 characters, with
       alphabet restrictions, to simplify their implementation.

       This is a mandatory line, and only one should exist in the file.

     2.5.3   Author [Name]

       This is an item for discussion.

     2.5.4   CRC [Decimal CRC Value]

       As .Fle files stand, it is possible to "slip something in" to the
       pipe, particularly if .Fle files are processed only once in a
       while as opposed to after each inbound call.

       A number of the proposed (and optional) features here provide
       safeguards against this.  Specifically, computing the file CRC,
       and preserving the original file date and size in the .Tic file.

       This has some value as a verification tool, without the legal
       encumbrances of PKSCrypt, etc.

       This probably should be a CRC-32 value.  This would also closely
       follow some of the ideas that are being considered for echomail
       processing.

       This is currently a point for discussion.  It probably should be a
       mandatory field.

     2.5.5   Created [Program Banner]

       This should contain some program identification information of the
       program that generated the attach information.
     FIDONEWS 14-05               Page 17                   3 Feb 1997


       There might be some standard format for the first part of this
       line, allowing for variant information after this.

       This is an optional line.

     2.5.6   Date [Date/Time of creation]

       This is a check for valid file pairing between the associated
       information file and the primary file.  It is the file date stamp
       of the primary file in Unix format.

     2.5.7   Desc [File Description]

       This is a description of the file.  There is as yet unspecified
       length restriction on this line.

       At the current time, exactly one of these lines should appear in
       the Tick file.

       In the future, more than one line may be supported.

     2.5.8   Dest [Address]

       This is related to Route (qv)

     2.5.9   Encrypted [PKS Key]

       Read the section on "GARBLE", and change it as follows:

       The file is initially encrypted using a PKS style encryption.
       This would be the ONLY time the file is encrypted.  The FTSC or
       someone would have to collect a list of valid public keys of
       authors (and probably eventually everyone).  The file would then
       be of "known-quality", or at least from a known source.  The key
       would be included in the .Tic file for ease of operation.

       The ramifications of this are considerable.  First off, PKSCrypt
       is something the spook types in the world are bothered by.
       Secondly, the source is not available, and the program does not
       work on some machines (i.e., my 386.)  Large keys would probably
       have to be used so a large number of possible keys will exist,
       which means considerable encryption and decryption processing
       time.  Finally, there is the question of a "Key registry", and how
       you verify them.

       I am not sure if this and Garbled are and/or or either/or.

     2.5.10  File [FileName]

       ONLY a filename (no path information) is contained on the FILE
       line.  No wildcards.

       Exactly one of these lines must exist in a Tick file.

     2.5.11  From [Address]

     FIDONEWS 14-05               Page 18                   3 Feb 1997


       This is the address of the system sending the file on the current
       leg.

     2.5.12  Garbled

       This is really just a thought for consideration than anything
       else.

       If this is present, the file referenced by the .Tic file is
       assumed to be archived (we'd have to address the issue of
       "deviant" archivers") by an agreed upon password between the
       sender and the sendee.

       The ramifications of this are considerable.  It would mean that
       individual archives would need to be created for any node so
       protected, which would need to be deleted after sending.  This
       implies a considerable expenditure of time and resources to create
       and store these archives.

     2.5.13  Log [Comment]

       This is another one for consideration.  Any such lines would be
       displayed on the console and/or the system log.

     2.5.14  Magic [FileName]

       This is food for thought.

       In order to resolve and standardize version numbering in file
       names, and magic file names, this might be used to distribute a
       "magic file name" with a given file.

       More than one of these lines might exist.

     2.5.15  Origin [Address]

       Where the file originally entered the system.

     2.5.16  Path [Address] {Arrival}

       Path lines are, among themselves, order dependent.  However, they
       need not be contiguous.

       The current path specification allows for only one address per
       path statement.

       It might make sense to leave it this way, and add an "Arrival
       time", which would be the time the file was processed.

       I.E., the file would start out with the path for this node and the
       next node with the time of creation.  When it gets to the next
       node, he changes his time to the time of processing, and puts out
       a similar line for the node(s) he sends to.

     2.5.17  Pw [Password]

     FIDONEWS 14-05               Page 19                   3 Feb 1997


       This is the password between the sender and the sendee.  This
       password is not case sensitive.

       Exactly one of these lines must exist in a Tick file.

       It would be nice to have some method of password securing that did
       not require the password to be exchanged in clear text.

     2.5.18  Release [DateTime]

       This is an optional line used to contain a Unix Date Time (seconds
       since 1970) of the release of the file.

       The handling of this is really murky as far as I can tell.  A
       brief digression into "political structures."

       Let's consider the case of the SDS.  In SDS, it has generally been
       assumed that ONLY nodes that are a part of the SDS get their files
       using Flea/Tick technology.  However, whether it is aware of it or
       not, this is not the case.

       Here's what I think was intended: a file comes in with a
       Pre-release time set.  That is the time at which the file is moved
       to the publicly available area.  I am not sure whether it is
       passed along the chain until that date, or if it is simply not to
       be made "publicly available" until that date.

     2.5.19  Replaces [FileName]

       Only a filespec, no path information, is contained on this flavor
       line.

       A REPLACES line is used to optionally (at each given node) dispose
       of older versions of the file being sent out.  For instance,
       Binkley releases are named:

       BEXE_XXX.Arc

       Assuming the next version of Binkley was 2.10, and assuming
       REPLACES was enabled for the given area, the file named on the
       REPLACES line would either be erased or moved if found.

       I.E.:

       FILE BEXE_210.Zoo
       REPLACES BEXE_*.Arc

       If these lines are encountered, and replacement is allowed, and
       BEXE_200.Arc was found, it would, in some way, be removed from the
       access directory.

       Wildcards should be allowed, but should also be used with care.

       Multiple REPLACES lines should be allowed.

     2.5.20  Route [Address]
     FIDONEWS 14-05               Page 20                   3 Feb 1997


       This is just thinking out loud.

       These would have to be order dependent.  They would be set up at
       the point of creation, and there would have to be agreements all
       along the way.

       A political nightmare, but very useful in a corporate environment.

       Collisions are a very real problem here.

     2.5.21  RtRcpt {Address}

       This is an item for discussion more than anything else.  It would
       be nice to have a means to find out how far your files have
       moved.  On the other hand, there are significant Policy type
       considerations for such a functionality.

       If the optional address is omitted, the ORIGIN is used.

     2.5.22  Seenby [Address] {Arrival}

       The current seenby specification allows for only one seenby per
       line.

       Seenby's are NOT order dependent.  Seenby information is more
       useful in "alphabetical" than encountered order, although it is
       not a requirement.

     2.5.23  Size [File Size in Bytes]

     2.5.24  Source [Address]

       Where the file actually came from.

       This is a point for discussion.  Let's consider the SDS again.

       In theory, SDS is a controlled system.  Files are only supposed to
       enter it from a very limited subset of FidoNet.  Currently, the
       Origin is the location the file was "launched" from, a very
       different thing than the author's address.

       The Source address, if present, is the address of a primary system
       used by the actual author.

       For instance, consider Binkley.  Binkley is supposed to enter the
       system at the region 16 SDS node, although it is written by nodes
       that do not participate in SDS.

     2.5.25  Topo {Address}

       This feature, if enabled, can be used to generate a topology
       report for the area specified to the given node.  If no node is
       specified, the report should be sent to the Origin node.

     2.5.26  Unidentified Verb Handling

     FIDONEWS 14-05               Page 21                   3 Feb 1997


       Lines with unrecognized verbs should be passed through.  Order is
       a critical issue here.  Unknown lines should be output in the same
       order they were input.

     ABSTRACT

     The following document proposes a standard for message identification
     and message reply identification for Fidonet and Fidonet-based
     electronic mail system.  It is based on the Usenet standard, RFC 850
     and successors.  The proposed standard will assist in duplicate-
     message detection and will permit the support of true reply threading
     across the network.  The standard consists of mandatory and suggested
     portions; however the term "mandatory" does not mean that any Fidonet
     product must implement this standard --it simply means that those that
     do claim to implement this standard must do so in the way described.

     BACKGROUND

     Currently, Fidonet messages are not uniquely identified.  A variety of
     schemes are in place to determine whether a message received by a
     Fidonet node has been previously processed by the node, but all of
     them involve a probabilistic component which may allow duplicates to
     slip through.  This can happen with particular ease where non-Fidonet
     gateways are involved which may reformat a message.

     In addition, Fidonet provides no clear and definite indication of
     whether a message is a reply to some other message, and if so, which
     message.  This is a consequence of the previous problem -- there is no
     way to refer to a message that is valid across all nodes.  Programs
     like TBBS, therefore, which do support the notion of detailed reply
     threading (each reply refers to some definite "parent" message) have
     to use a semi-guesswork algorithm which frequently leads to the wrong
     answer -- the latest message with a common Subject header is taken to
     be the parent, even when examination of the context by a human being
     indicates that the message is in reply to some earlier message.

     The Usenet network, which shares much of its problem domain with
     Fidonet, solves these problems by tagging every outgoing message with
     a unique Message ID string.  Other messages can then refer to this
     Message ID and provide an unambiguous indication of which message, or
     messages, they are in reply to.

     IFNA KLUDGE LINES "MESSAGE-ID" AND "IN-REPLY-TO"

     Fidonet supports a general method for sending additional information
     embedded in a message known as the "IFNA kludge line".  This is a line
     of text beginning with the ASCII SOH character.  The characters
     following SOH are a word indicating the type of kludge line, and the
     remainder of the line contains information specific to that type.

     This standard introduces two new types of kludge lines, the MESSAGE-ID
     FIDONEWS 14-05               Page 23                   3 Feb 1997


     line and the IN-REPLY-TO line.  These names, and the kludge line
     formats, are taken directly from Usenet.  MESSAGE-ID is used to tag an
     outgoing message with a unique string, different from any other
     message on the network.  IN-REPLY-TO is used by threading message
     processors to specify the Message ID of the "parent" of a reply
     message.  These kludge lines are generated and interpreted by message
     editors; tosser/scanner and mailer products need only leave them
     undisturbed.  They are applicable to both regular network mail
     and Echomail.

     FORMAT OF A MESSAGE ID -- MANDATORY

     This format is drawn directly from Usenet; it may seem a little
     arcane, but is flexible enough to handle a large variety of needs.
     Generally, a Message ID looks like this:
             <unique-part@domain-name>
     The <, @, and > characters are fixed, and are used to help in parsing
     the Message ID.  The "unique-part" may consist of any characters --
     the only requirement is that it be different for every message
     generated on a given node or point.  Possible implementations of
     "unique-part"s include a simple serial number, a date+time, or
     something completely different.

     The "domain-name" must be a valid Internet domain name.  Luckily,
     every Fidonet system has a valid domain name now!  The format here is
     as follows:
             The domain name of the node a:bbb/ccc is
                     Fccc.Nbbb.Za.FIDONET.ORG
             and the domain name of the point a:bbb/ccc.ddd is
                     Pddd.Fccc.Nbbb.Za.FIDONET.ORG
     The periods, magic letters, and the magic name "FIDONET.ORG" make the
     domain name unique in the world.  Of course, Fidonet systems that
     already have a different domain name (e.g. circle.UUCP) are free to
     use that name instead.

     A system which generates Message IDs must guarantee that no Message ID
     will be reused for at least two years.  This implies that if multiple
     message editors exist on a system they must cooperate at least to the
     extent of not using the same Message IDs for different messages.  In
     particular, a message editor that uses a simple serial number should
     make provision for the user to set the starting serial number to a
     value other than zero, so that different starting values can be used
     by different products.  Note that the numeric name of a .MSG file is
     >not< suitable as a unique-part, because it is neither unique nor
     permanent.

     FORMAT OF A MESSAGE ID -- SUGGESTED

     It is suggested, though not required, that the unique-part of all
     Message IDs consist only of decimal digits, and not more than 9 of
     these, so that the unique-part can be stored as a 32-bit signed
     integer.  A serial number scheme meets this standard, as does a Unix-
     style timestamp (seconds since midnight Jan 1 1970, Universal Time).
     There many other possible schemes.

     CREATION OF THE IN-REPLY-TO LINE -- MANDATORY
     FIDONEWS 14-05               Page 24                   3 Feb 1997


     The most important thing about the IN-REPLY-TO line is that the
     Message ID specified by it should be the actual Message ID of the
     message being replied to, and not a Message ID invented by the sender
     of the reply.  This implies that message editors which generate IN-
     REPLY-TO lines should be able to store the Message IDs of all incoming
     and locally generated messages for as long as the messages themselves
     remain on-line.  It is worth repeating, however, that there is nothing
     mandatory about generating the IN-REPLY-TO line at all.  A message
     editor may generate both MESSAGE-ID and IN-REPLY-TO lines, only
     MESSAGE-ID lines, or neither.

     Due to problems with existing software, message editors should be
     prepared to receive (and either discard or display uninterpreted) IN-
     REPLY-TO lines which are >not< in standard format.  Standard format
     lines will have a < character just after the keyword and a > character
     at the end of the line.

     DUPLICATE MESSAGE ELIMINATION

     Usenet makes use of a "history file" which maintains the Message IDs
     of messages received in the last 15 days (this number is configurable
     by the sysop).  Fidonet has a similar scheme, but this is inherently
     less reliable, depending as it does on the exact layout of each
     message.  With MESSAGE-ID kludge lines, dupe eliminators can take
     advantage of them to help kill dupes once and for all, using existing
     mechanisms as a backup when needed.

     IMPLICATIONS FOR USENET GATEWAYS

     Currently, Fidonet<->Usenet gateways generate Message IDs for messages
     passing from Fidonet to Usenet, and discard them for messages passing
     the other way.  With this standard in place, such gateways should be
     modified to watch for MESSAGE-ID and IN-REPLY-TO kludge lines and
     translate them to Usenet "Message-ID:" and "In-Reply-To:" header
     lines, and vice versa.  This will improve the behavior of threading
     systems like TBBS on the Fidonet side and 'notes' on the Usenet side.
     Fidonet messages which don't have a MESSAGE-ID line will, of course,
     need to have one generated when passing over to Usenet, as is now the
     case.

     IMPLEMENTATIONS

     The Magpie tree-structured BBS is now being enhanced to provide
     Fidonet access to its users.  Magpie depends heavily on the notion of
     parent messages; every message on a Magpie system (except one) has a
     parent.  Magpie/Fidonet systems will use the above technique to pass
     the parent information they need transparently through the Fidonet, so
     that incoming Fidonet messages can be connected at the correct place
     in the Magpie tree.  (A backup algorithm similar to TBBS's will be
     used for Fidonet messages without parent information.)

     We are publishing this information as a Fidonet technical comment in
     hopes that other Fidonet products will eventually incorporate all or
     part of this standard as well, and that it will eventually form part
     of a Fidonet Technical Standard.

               EchoMail ^aEID: Dup-Checking with Linked Replies
           A Proposal To The FidoNet Technical Standards Committee

     Currently, no universal methodology for implementing echomail
     duplicate message checking exists.  One thing is certain - they
     will only increase in number as the shear volume of echomail is
     increasing every day!

     In order to catch the highest percentage of duplicates possible
     it is desirable to utilize a system which actually tags each of
     the messages themselves with a distinct messages identifier to
     be used to check against an existing database of all previous
     messages' identifiers.  In practice, this is not possible, but
     we can limit the number of previous identifiers kept so that
     processing is quick but still almost certain to eliminate any
     duplicate messages.

     This also provides an easy method of linking replies to their
     original message by appending the previous identifier.  Using
     a linked reply technique allows easy relinking of the messages
     to the original message, assuming it still exists.

     This proposed ^aEID: kludge line specifications are as follows:

     1)  A 16-bit CRC followed by a 32-bit DOS file date/time stamp.

     2)  The 16-bit CRC is calculated by first CRC'ing all but the
         first 11 (static) characters of the origin line, followed
         by the first two "words" of the from name, the first two
         words of the to name, and the first 25 characters of the
         subject line after stripping leading occurances of "Re: "
         sequences.

     Notes:  You must always upper-case the to/from/subject fields,
       as some current processors will change the case of that text.
       Using only the first two words of the from and to names will
       eliminate the potential problem when some processors add the
       " of xxx/yyy" to the end.  Stripping all leading occurances
       of the "Re: " in the subject field is also done to eliminate
       the possibility of changed subject lines not matching with
       the original message, which is also the reason for limiting
       the length of that field to the first 25 bytes (after taking
       off all the "Re: " sequences), because adding the leading
       "Re: " may force characters out (because they are beyond the
       72-character field limit).

     When you must add an EID line for a message which is not local,
     you have to zero the seconds field before creating the 32-bit

     time stamp - some processors eliminate this information!  This
     limitation can be overcome if most editors insert them at the
     time they are written.

     Automatic reply linking
     ========= ===== =======

     When replying to a message with an ^aEID: line, extend the new
     ^aEID: with the ^aEID: fields of the original message.  The new
     line would look like this:

     ^aEID: xxxx yyyyzzzz uuuu vvvvwwww

     Where 'uuuu vvvvwwww' is the Eid information of the original
     message.  Only one previous message's information is retained.

                      Uniform EchoMail Quoting Style
          A Proposal To The FidoNet Technical Standards Committee

     As more and more new software appears on the network, it has
     become evident that we need a universal method for quoting text
     of previous messages in replies.

     Because of the way quoted text must appear, it is necessary to
     format said text with "Hard" <CR> characters, in order to keep
     the block from drifting should the new text itself be quoted.

     The following method should allow current and future programs
     to properly identify and handle previously quoted material.

     Newly quoted text should be preceeded by the a single space,
     a greater than symbol ('>') and another space.

     Optionally a field of initials may appear in front of the
     greater than symbol, like this:  " MR> ".  If you allow the
     initials to be inserted, they should only be inserted into
     lines which have not been previously quoted.  (in other words,
     don't add initials to anything already quoted)

     Successive quotes of previously quoted material should only add
     a single ">" in front of the existing text, which may eliminate
     the leading blank space.

     Blank lines in quotes should remain blank (no '>' or initials).

     Kludge lines, including tear lines and origins lines are not
     normally quoted, but when they are - they must never be quoted
     exactly - this definitely causes problems with other software!

                             FidoNet Message ID Proposal
                                    By Todd Kover
                                1:261/5016;1:261/1028

      Since there are many proposals for Message-IDs, for dupe-checking,
     and reply-linking, I figured, I may as well do my best to add
     confusion to things, and come up with another one.  :-)  In my playing
     around with different ideas, and such, I came out with the following
     format:

     ^AFMSGID:DDDYYHHMMSSLLNNNNOOOOPPPP[ZZZZ][Domain]

     ^AFREPLY: < Repeat of what is above >

     Here's a brief explanation of what each area is...

     DDD:    (01-366) The day of the year. (Julian calendar method).

     YY:     (0x00-0xFF) The year.  Now, this only gives 255 year accuracy,
             but, if the message has been in circulation that long, then it
             deserves to be read again.  :-)

     HH:     (00-23) Hour which the message was written

     MM:     (00-59) Minute which the message was written

     SS:     (00-59) Seconds which the message was written

     LL:     (0x01-0xFF) In reading NET_DEV, and FTSC, and all of the
             debating over "What happens when someone enters a message at
             the EXACT same time, on my multiline system?) Well, the best
             way to avoid that, is to either A) Set the ID while packing
             the message up, and only pack all the lines messages in, at
             once, or, use this option, that sets the line number, of the
             caller (0-0xFF)..  I figure that there won't be more than 255
             lines to a single node...  I would opt for the former, but, I
             put this in here, to shut everyone up.  :-)

     NNNN:   (0x00-0xFFFF)  The Net Number of the node, that this message
             originates from.

     OOOO:   (0x00-0xFFFF)  The Node Number of the node, that this message
             originates from.

     PPPP:   (0x00-0xFFFF)  The Point Number of the node, that this message
             originates from.
     FIDONEWS 14-05               Page 28                   3 Feb 1997


     ------
     Now for the Optional ones:

     ZZZZ:   Since there is a question as to weather or not Zones should be
             implemented, and, some packages do not implement them, I
             figured that this should be optional.  If it is not there,
             then a Domain address would be there, or, nothing at all.

     Domain: This is for the people that use these (SEADogians, for one).
             I am assuming that Domains are alphabetic characters, and no
             numbers are there (Which is probobly stupid on my part), so
             that software can distingish between Domains, and Zones.

     ------

     The FREPLY: is just teh FMSGID of the message that the message is
     replying too.  That way, you can just compare.


     In order to allow dupe checking, a system has to keep a backlog of all
     of the message IDs for some period of time (say 2 weeks?) that pass
     through the system, and has to compare a new one to the old ones.  If
     it matches, then the message is a dupe.  This doesn't seem too
     efficient, since there are alot of messages that pass through
     something such as a backbone, but, I am sure there is some way to make
     it fast, I just haven't put enough thought into it, yet).

     ------

     One of the more nicer features about this, is that if the ID is not
     there, then it can be calculated by examinining parts of the message,
     and the header to get all of the information, and, it can be put in
     there.  Pretty simple, eh?

     ------

     If you want to get in contact with me, to make contacts on this, you
     can reach me at my private node, 1:261/5016, but, since I only poll
     the Net-Coordinator once a week, or so, to pick up my NodeDiff, and
     FidoNews, I will be a little slow in responding to it.  You can reach
     me pretty quickly on 1:261/1028, which is the only BBS that I
     frequent, just about daily, and, if I don't, the sysop there will tell
     me if there is anything waiting for me...  Direct flames, and such
     things to NIL:, thank you..

     Paul Quinn at 3:640/384

     Aha!  Here it is... knew I had it somewhere.  I found this description
     of the network lying around and, as I'd had such a good belly-laugh,
     thought that I ought to really pass it around.

      El Explicito:

      "I tried the thing, ya know, and it worked, ya know, but now it
       doesn't, ya know?"

      Advantages   :  Provides interesting communication challenges.
      Disadvantages:  So do chimps.
      Symptoms     :  Complete inability to use proper nouns

      Real Case    :  One user walked up to a certain Armenian pod manager
                      and said, "I can't get what I want!"  The pod manager
                      leaned back, put his hands on his belt-buckle, and
                      said, "Well, ma'am, you've come to the right place."

      Mad Bomber:

      "Well, I hit Alt-f6, shift-f8, Cntrl-f10, f4, and f9, and now it
       looks all weird."

      Advantages   :  Will try to find own solution to problems.
      Disadvantages:  User might have translated document to Navajo without
                      meaning to.
      Symptoms     :  More than six stopped jobs in UNIX, a 2:1 code-to-
                      letter ratio in WordPerfect
      Real Case    :  One user came in complaining that his WordPerfect
                      document was underlined.  When I used reveal codes on
                      it, I found that he'd set and unset underline more
                      than fifty times in his document.

      Frying Pan/Fire Tactician:

      "It didn't work with the data set we had, so I fed in my aunt's
       Recipe for key lime pie."

      Advantages   :  Will usually fix error.
      Disadvantages:  'Fix' is defined VERY loosely here.
      Symptoms     :  A tendency to delete lines that get errors instead of
                      fixing them.
      Real Case    :  One user complained that their program executed, but
                      didn't do anything.  The scon looked at it for twenty
                      minutes before realizing that they'd commented out
                      EVERY LINE.  The user said, "Well, that was the only
                      way I could get it to compile."

      Shaman:

      "Last week, when the moon was full, the clouds were thick, and
       formahaut was above the horizon, I typed f77, and lo, it did
       compile."

      Advantages   :  Gives insight into primitive mythology.
      Disadvantages:  Few scons are anthropology majors.
      Symptoms     :  Frequent questions about irrelevant objects.
      Real Case    :  One user complained that all information on one of
                      their disks got erased (as Norton Utilities showed
                      nothing but empty sectors, I suspect nothing had ever
                      been on it).  Reasoning that the deleted information
                      went *somewhere*, they wouldn't shut up until the
                      scon checked four different disks for the missing
                      information.

      X-user:

      "Will you look at those...um, that resolution, quite impressive,
       really."

      Advantages   :  Using the cutting-edge in graphics technology.
      Disadvantages:  Has little or no idea how to use the cutting-edge in
                      graphics technology.
      Symptoms     :  Fuzzy hands, blindness
      Real Case    :  When I was off duty, two users sat down in front of
                      me at DEC station 5000/200s that systems was
                      reconfiguring.  I suppressed my laughter while, for
                      twenty minutes, they sat down and did their best to
                      act like they were doing exactly what they wanted to
                      do, even though they couldn't log in.

      Miracle Worker:

      "But it read a file from it yesterday!"  'Sir, at a guess, this disk
       has been swallowed and regurgitated.'  "But I did that a month ago,
       and it read a file from it yesterday!"

      Advantages   :  Apparently has remarkable luck when you aren't
                      around.
      Disadvantages:  People complain when scons actually use the word
                      "horse-puckey".
      Symptoms     :  Loses all ability to do impossible when you're
                      around.  Must be the kryptonite in your pocket.
      Real Case    :  At least three users have claimed that they've loaded
                      IBM WordPerfect from Macintosh disks.

      Taskmaster:

      "Well, this is a file in MacWrite.  Do you know how I can upload it
       to MUSIC, transfer it over to UNIX from there, download it onto an
       IBM, convert it to WordPerfect, and put it in three-column format?"

      Advantages   :  Bold new challenges.
      Disadvantages:  Makes one wish to be a garbage collector.
      Symptoms     :  An inability to keep quiet.  Strong tendencies to
                      make machines do things they don't want to do.
      Real Case    :  One user tried to get a scon to find out what another
                      person's E-mail address was even though the user
                      didn't know his target's home system, account name,
                      or real name.

      Maestro:

      "Well, first I sat down, like this.  Then I logged on, like this, and
       after that, I typed in my password, like this, and after that I
       edited my file, like this, and after that I went to this line here,
       like this, and after that I picked my nose, like this..."

      Advantages   :  Willing to show you exactly what they did to get an
                      error.
     Disadvantages:   For as long as five or six hours.
      Symptoms     :  Selective deafness to the phrases, "Right, right,
                      okay, but what was the ERROR?", and a strong fondness
                      for the phrase, "Well, I'm getting to that."
      Real Case    :  I once had to spend half an hour looking over a
                      user's shoulder while they continuously retrieved a
     FIDONEWS 14-05               Page 34                   3 Feb 1997


                      document into itself and denied that they did it (the
                      user was complaining that their document was 87
                      copies of the same thing).

      Princess (unfair, perhaps, as these tend, overwhelmingly, to be
                males):

      "I need a Mac, and someone's got the one I like reserved, would you
       please garrote him and put him in the paper recycling bin?"

      Advantages   :  Flatters you with their high standards for your
                      service.
      Disadvantages:  Impresses you with their obliviousness to other
                      people on this planet.
      Symptoms     :  Inability to communicate except by complaining.
      Real Case    :  One asked a scon to remove the message of the day
                      because he (the user) didn't like it.

     Yours Humouresly,
     The Humour Man (aka Demitri Baroutsos)

     Latest Greatest Software Versions
     by Peter E. Popovich, 1:363/264

     My apologies to everyone; I missed last week's deadline. Sigh. And I
     was doing so well... ;-)

     I thought I'd have phased out the old info by now, but old info still
     makes up 47% of the column. I kept a few of the old sections around,
     hoping it would encourage folks to write in. It's also been harder to
     find contact info than I expected.

     Anyone who has contact info for -any- package of interest to Fidonet
     sysops is encouraged to submit it. I'm happy to do the leg-work of
     tracking down the specifics if I have a name to start with.

     Fair warning: The Xenix, Atari, and CoCo sections got a reprieve
     because folks wrote in. Since then, I've gotten a few Unix and Atari
     submissions, but no CoCo submissions. I plan to phase out the old
     Xenix and CoCo sections soon unless I hear something new. The Atari
     section will follow once I've followed up on my leads.

     Phased out this week: TBBS 2.1, TComm/TCommNet 3.4,
                           Telegard 2.7, and TPBoard 6.1

     Phase-out highlights:
       This week: "Xenix/Unix 386 -- Other Utilities" Section
             Deadline for info: 14 Feb 1997.
       Last week: WildCat! 3.02 and XBBS 1.77
             Deadline for info: 7 Feb 1997.
