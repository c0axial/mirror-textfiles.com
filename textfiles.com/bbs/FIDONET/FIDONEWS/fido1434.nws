     It's that back-to-school thing, I reckon. It certainly got me today
     and I was [so I thought] ready for it. I wasn't and this is the latest
     edition I've ever published.

     The upside is that you weren't missing much since there is not a lot
     of material available this week. [grin]

     For those who used to clamor about the size of our newsletter ...

     "This dud's for you!"

                         Fidonet Is All Of Us!
                           by Walter Luffman
                      wluffman@usit.net, 1:123/10


     When I began writing this, I was rather pessimistic about Fidonet's
     future.  I still have several concerns; but rather than wait for
     changes, I want to be a part of those changes.  And I encourage
     everyone else to do their part to revitalize Fidonet -- not just the
     nodelisted members and officials, but individual BBS users as well.

     Zone coordinators: I neither know nor care why we have gone so long
     without an International Coordinator, but I do care that you have not
     corrected this situation.  Fidonet is an international network of
     hobbyists.  Please put aside any personal agendas and work in the best
     interests of our mutual hobby.

     To all *Cs at every level, I say this: Whether or not Policy 4
     mentions it, your positions make you important spokespeople for
     Fidonet.  In addition to your regular duties, you owe it to Fidonet to
     make yourselves available to the news media.  The networks, talk-shows
     and newspapers can always find people to talk about the Internet, but
     BBSes and Fidonet almost never get this sort of public exposure.  You
     don't have to face the media all alone, of course; you can always ask
     another Fidonet official, or a sysop, to join you for an interview or
     talk-show appearance.

     *ECs: Policy 4 notwithstanding, echomail is the most important part of
     Fidonet.  Without echomail, users would have very little reason to
     call a Fidonet node.  Without users, very few sysops would have any
     reason to operate their own nodes.  Your job calls more ensuring that
     echomail moves smoothly, but you must also work to _promote_ echomail.
     When is the last time you encouraged nodes to carry more echoes?  When
     is the last time you thanked the people below you in the Fidonet
     hierarchy for helping to move the mail, or asked if there are any
     problems?

     Sysops: You probably already publicize your BBS to one degree or
     another; but are you including Fidonet in your publicity efforts?  I'm
     talking about such simple things as including your node number on
     business cards, flyers and your listing in the local BBS list.  (If
     there isn't a local BBS list, encourage one of your users to start and
     maintain one -- with the latest version always available as a free
     download from your BBS, of course.)  But don't stop there; make sure
     you offer the sort of content your users want.  Carry as many echoes
     as you can, or at least those echoes your users request...and make
     sure they know you will add backboned echoes upon request.

     BBS users: Technically we are not "members" of Fidonet; but we can
     actually do far more to advance Fidonet than all of the above
     categories combined, simply because there are so many of us.  Tell
     FIDONEWS 14-34               Page 3                   25 Aug 1997


     your friends about BBSes and Fidonet, stressing the fact that "spam"
     and other annoyances that are so common on the Internet are almost
     nonexistent on Fidonet.  Help newbies setup their modems and
     communications software, and provide a list of BBS telephone numbers.
     Join a user group -- or start one -- and use it as an opportunity to
     publicize your favorite BBSes and echoes to the other members.  Offer
     to help your sysop distribute business cards and flyers to local
     businesses.  In short, do whatever you can to spread the word about
     BBSes and Fidonet.

     It will take a combined effort, with all of us working together, to
     revitalize Fidonet.  If you care about the hobby, do whatever you can.
     As for myself, I'm going to put together that BBS computer I've been
     wanting and netmail my application to the NC; there are plenty of
     people where I live who have never even heard of Fidonet, and I can do
     something about that.  I'm also handing out cards publicizing my
     favorite echo -- PC Addicts -- and the node through which I receive
     it.

     (Comments are welcome.  For fastest delivery, please use Internet e-
     mail; my ISP is a local call, but my netmail node is long-distance and
     thus I only call it two or three times per week.)

     Astrowar Fidonet PBM Game Released
     Damian Walker, 2:2502/666

         The Astrowar play-by-mail (PBM) game has been released.  Although
     not restricted to Fidonet, the game was developed specifically for use
     on my Fidonet node.  Now it has been released, everyone is welcome to
     take a copy and have a play with it.  I believe that this is the first
     traditional style text PBM in Fidonet.
         Note that this game is designed to be played primarily by DIRECT
     netmail.  Routed netmail is only suitable where permission of netmail
     routers has been granted (such as local net games through a willing
     net host).
         By way of an introduction to the game, I've included in this
     article an example of a small e-zine posting that goes into the
     support/discussion echo regularly.  Enjoy.

     SOFTWARE RELEASED

         Mid August saw the release of the software for the Astrowar game,
     which has been in the beta testing phase since May.
         Astrowar is a play-by-mail game of space conquest, and a companion
     program Astromail allows the game to be played via Fidonet netmail.
     This would normally be direct netmail, but where net hosts allow,
     routed mail can be used (such as in local net games, for instance).
         Both Astrowar and Astromail are currently available for DOS (386
     DPMI required) and Linux.  The source code has also been released
     under the GNU GPL, so anyone wanting to run the software under another
     platform can get hold of the source code and recompile it.
         The software is available for file request from 2:2502/666, and
     the following list gives the filenames and sizes:

         Product_________________    Filename____    Size (approx)_______
                    Astrowar 1.00      AST100.ZIP                     99k
                 Astrowar/LX 1.00     AST100L.ZIP                     70k
     FIDONEWS 14-34               Page 5                   25 Aug 1997


                Astrowar/386 1.00     AST100X.ZIP                    106k
                   Astromail 1.01      ASM100.ZIP                    119k
                Astromail/LX 1.01     ASM100L.ZIP                     73k
               Astromail/386 1.01     ASM100X.ZIP                    112k

         These files will shortly appear on the Internet, at ftp.pbm.com,
     although I don't know exactly where on that site they will be placed.
     The site maintainer may well set up an 'astrowar' directory for them,
     since most other PBM games seem to have their own directories there.
         Games are already running in the UK, and may appear elsewhere now
     that the software is available.  Some people have expressed an
     interest in developing an Internet mail interface to allow Internet
     play.
         Finally, there is a support and discussion echo for the software,
     called ASTROWAR_UK.  Despite the _UK suffix, international
     participants are welcome.  The echo is available on the region 25
     backbone, and will soon appear in the zone 2 and International ELISTs.

     Fidonet in Europe

     by David Meikle (2:259/27.4 , rebeljambo@geocities.com)

     Sadly there is no news in this week but if anybody has anything they
     would like to see on the Fidonet in Europe web site
     (www.geocities.com/siliconValley/way/8351) please email me.

     I have had many requests to do some thing like this so there is no
     time like the present. I have decided to have a vote on how has helped
     zone 2 the most over the years. We could have it as a yearly thing but
     to make up for all of the years lets have a vote on who has helped
     zone 2 out the most over the 80s and 90s.

     This week I'm going to start by getting 20 people nominated and
     seconded. To do this you must send a netmail like this example

     I nominate <the persons name> because they have helped zone 2 by

     You can also email me by the internet on this address:
     david.meikle@p4.f27.n259.z2.fidonet.org

     next week I will publish the list of people and how to do the next
     part of voting.

     Mercury News.  Ordinary people enter short articles stating why their
     friends or loved ones should be considered to be extraordinary.

     Top 11 Reasons Why Computer Geeks Make Better Husbands
     By Kathi Hunder

     11. Computer geeks require little mirror time
         (unlike the marketing guy I used to date).

     10. You never have to worry about shopping for
         birthdays or Christmas -- a Computer Literacy gift
         certificate will do just fine.

      9. No need to buy expensive work clothes--a couple
         pairs of jeans and Dockers will carry your computer
         geek for about two years.

      8. I was the first woman on the block to have my own
         e-mail address.

      7. My shopping list has been on a spreadsheet for
         about three years now.

      6. Computer geeks never go carousing at bars--just
         Fry's Electronics.
