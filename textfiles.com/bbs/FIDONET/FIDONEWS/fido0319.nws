                        AVOIDING COMPUTER CHAUVINISM
                                Mike Guffey

     In  the  process  of  adding  to   our   stable   of   electronic
     paraphernalia,  it  is  sometimes  easy  to  forget just what our
     computers are: collections of switches that turn on or off.  Yes,
     some are much fancier and faster and  sleeker  than  others,  but
     there  is a price to be paid for more buttons,  knobs and gizmos.
     It is easy to  forget  just  how  useful  smaller,  slower,  less
     expensive  machines are for some people and perhaps once were for
     us as well.  To  paraphrase  Peter  McWilliams,  computers  don't
     become obsolete, they just become last year's models.

     So,  in  searching for (or even recommending) a new computer,  we
     must not forget just what  we  should  be  looking  for:  greater
     utility.  And  if  that  utility  is  measured  in  speed,  color
     graphics,  storage capacity,  and the like,  then fine.  But,  if
     instead,  we fall victim to marketing hype and spend more than we
     should or need to we are likely be seduced by each expensive  new
     bell  or  whistle and never be satisfied with what we buy.  It is
     fundamental that the more expensive the basic computer,  the more
     expensive  the  cost of upgrading.  Knowing when to stop spending
     money may be =the= hardest computing lesson  to  learn.  It's  an
     undocumented lesson.

     We  must  never  forget that the best selling computing device on
     the face of this earth is still the ancient  abacus.  It  suffers
     neither  from  power  failures nor complicated and undecipherable
     documentation. It's just slower.

     Dave O'Shea, 107/35

                     Hayes Bell/CCITT compatible modems


     For some reason or another,  overseas communications have come to
     be  much  more common than they once were.  Maybe all of us modem
     addicts have run out of new BBS's to call within the US, or maybe
     we've just made a subconscious decision to make Ma Bell rich.

     Anyhow,  There seems to be a major bottleneck with the problem of
     incompatible modems. Bell has one standard, CCITT another.

     Hayes microcomputer products, of Smartmodem fame, has just redone
     their  smartmodem  line  again.All  new Hayes modems have builtin
     Bell/CCITT compatability. All you have to do is flip a switch.  I
     also understand that the user can select Bell  or  CCITT  through
     software,  but  I'm  not sure what the command is.  I'm sure it's
     referenced somewhere in their manual.

     I am production manager for a PC distributor in Manhattan,  and I
     can  tell  you that Hayes puts out a quality product.  It costs a
     little extra, but it's well worth the expense. Very rarely will I
     see a Hayes box in the returns pile.

     Any feedback on these modems is welcome,  and may be directed  to
     Fido 107/35.

                                   LOGMSG
             A new Utility to log Sysop comments to MAILER.LOG


     As more and more  BBS  support  processes  become  automated,  it
     becomes  more difficult to monitor just what worked correctly and
     what may have failed.  In order to provide a consolidated  record
     of  just  what  does  go on,  LOGMSG was created to simply append
     comments to MAILER.LOG.  It is expected to  usually  be  executed
     from inside an automated batch file.

     The format of the execution command for LOGMSG is:

         LOGMSG comment

     where  "comment"  is  a  1  to  120 character string of any ASCII
     characters that the user wishes to add to the end of  MAILER.LOG.
     All   blanks   immediately  following  "LOGMSG"  are  ignored  as
     "comment" is assumed to start with the first non-blank character.
     It may contain as many embedded blanks as desired, however.

     By default, LOGMSG will append the given comment to the file:

        D:\FIDO\MAILER.LOG

     If you wish to change this default it is  necessary  to  run  the
     program LMSETUP.  This is done by entering the command:

        LMSETUP

     Note  that  it  is  required  that  LOGMSG.EXE  be located in the
     default directory when this  command  is  entered.  LMSETUP  will
     display  the  current  default  FILESPEC and allow you to enter a
     replacement.  Any valid DOS filespec,  complete with  full  path,
     may  be  entered  as  long as the total length does not exceed 44
     bytes.  In the event that you do not wish to change  the  current
     default, just hit enter instead of entering a new filespec.


     LOGMSG.ARC,   which  includes  LOGMSG.EXE,   LMSETUP.EXE  and  an
     expanded version of  this  file,  LOGMSG.DOC,  is  available  for
     downloading from:

     D2-FIDO  (107/211)  516-682-8525 evenings or weekends at 1200 bps
     DANIELS-FIDO (107/211) 516-367-9626 most any time/day 2400-300

     It is distributed under the Shareware concept and may be used for
     free by  all  users  other  than  those  with  direct  commercial
     application.

     Alfred Anderson, 14/61

                                  SYSREPT
                                  =======


     A new version of SYSREPT  is  now  available.  Version  1.52  was
     released  April 28,  1986.  This version now correctly interprets
     the  upload/download  logs  of  FIDO  Version  11v.   It  is  not
     compatible  with pre-version 11v releases of FIDO.  If the format
     of the SYSOP.LOG file  remains  constant,  this  new  release  of
     SYSREPT will be around for a while.

     For  those  not  familiar  with  SYSREPT,  this is a utility that
     provides management data to FIDO  SYSOPS.  The  reports  are  too
     comprehensive to be included in this article (they also require a
     full  80  columns).  However,  a few partial examples might be of
     interest:

     The Compressed Console Log Report provides a daily listing of all
     callers showing the  time  they  called,  baud  rate,  length  of
     connection, name, incorrect password attempts, file uploads, file
     downloads, and identifies first time callers.

     The  Download Log Report shows,  during the analysis period,  how
     many  times  various  files  have   been   downloaded.   Arranged
     alphabetically,  this  helps a SYSOP determine when certain files
     should be removed.

     The Upload Log Report lists files uploaded as well as the  names,
     dates,  and  times  the uploads took place.  This is an excellent
     means of determining who uploaded selected files.

     However,  the real power if SYSREPT is in the Utilization Report.
     The  entire  report cannot be contained in a FidoNews article due
     to column width limitations.  However,  this should  give  you  a
     good idea as to how it looks:

     SYSREPT  may  be downloaded from several nodes.  The most current
     version is always available from FIDO 14/61  (507-289-8452,  2400
     baud/  23hrs  )  in File Area #1 (Fido Software).  You could also
     check 100/22 or other nodes in St.  Louis.  They  have  an  early
     copy because without Ben Baker's help, the new version of SYSREPT
     would  only  be  a  gleam  in my eye.  Ben offered many excellent
     suggestions and provides considerable quantities of test data.

     Although SYSREPT will now handle the SYSOP.LOG  file,  there  are
     still  a few anomolies that are difficult to interpret.  Since we
     humans cannot  figure  out  what  the  .LOG  file  means  in  all
     circumstances,   SYSREPT   will   err   on   the  side  of  being
     conservative.  It will not report  a  file  as  being  downloaded
     unless it can prove that the download was successful.

     is  made available to help others.  No request for "donations" is
     being made.  Just enjoy using the software.)

                             ADVENTURE Revisted
                                     By
                              Jim Butterfield

             Adventures are good for you.  The increase  literacy  and
     exercise your mind.  They can be fun to create, and fun to solve.
     And  (don't  quote  me  on this) they're fun to cheat on,  too --
     sneaking answers out of the program when  you  can't  figure  out
     what to do next.

             It's  worth making comments on the "sneaking" part.  When
     I'm asked "How do you get past the snake?" or some other question
     spawned from utter frustration,  I tend to have a standard reply:
     "Ask me again, and I'll tell you the answer ...  but first, think
     and be sure you  really  WANT  it."  It's  annoying  to  be  told
     something that you would have thought of yourself...  any  moment
     now.

             Similarly,  in anticipation of clever adverturers listing
     the program and browsing through my files,  I carefully encrypted
     the command list.  This is particularly Machiavellian on my part,
     I  think.  An  experienced  programmer  can  find  out what might
     happen, but still not how to make it happen.

             I'm talking,  of course,  about the  original  Adventure,
     which  was  written by Crowther and Woods.  It grew -- in organic
     manner -- at M.I.T.,  and quickly spread to all Digital Equipment
     Corporation (DEC) computer systems, worldwide.  Many big computer
     users didn't even know they had it,  but file advent  was  there,
     all right.  It took up a huge amount of memory.  The architecture
     of  large systems allowed such programs to be restricted to quiet
     times,  so that the command HOURS would list -- from  the  system
     log  --  the  non-priority  hours during which Adventure could be
     played.

             When micros started to gain attention, Adventure became a
     common case in point for computer users.  Many users said: "These
     small computers are all very well, but I can tell you one problem
     which  will never fit..." -- meaning the original Adventure.  And
     when 8K machines expanded to 16K and then 32K, I decided I needed
     to take a shot at it.  I viewed the game as a "classic"; I didn't
     want to change it or put in my own cute things.  For  memory  and
     run  time considerations,  I abbreviated a few small parts of the
     game.

             Let me tell you a little about Adventure, if you've never
     been there.  You begin by finding yourself at the end of  a  road
     before  a  small  brick  building.  A  stream  runs  out  of  the
     building.  From that point on, you're on your own -- except for a
     rumour that somewhere nearby is supposed to be a  Colossal  Cave,
     filled with fabulous wealth.

     Fidonews                     Page 9                   12 May 1986


             When  you  find the cave,  you're confronted by dozens of
     events.  The cave is populated by dwarves, a troll,  a dragon,  a
     giant  clam,  a tiny bird,  a shadowy figure off in the distance,
     something that rustles as it follows you,  a  little  plant  that
     whispers "water," a fierce green snake,  and a bear.  Some of the
     treasures seem to have special problems: a delicate Ming vase can
     be picked up,  but breaks when it's dropped;  a gold nugget makes
     the  exit  stairway  vanish  if  you  pick it up;  and a platinum
     pyramid is not only invisible in  a  dark  room,  but  won't  fit
     through the tiny exit hole.  But -- as is often said -- there are
     no problems, there are only challenges.

             Even in the early days,  Adventure  inspired  a  host  of
     emulators.  TPUG  President  Michael  Bonnycastle wrote Caves and
     Stygian Tombs,  so as to devise  an  interesting  adventure  that
     would fit within 8K of memory.  As a response, I wrote an "array"
     adventure  called  Explore  to demonstrate how to fit the maximum
     number of rooms within limited memory.

             As systems grew in memory size  and  general  capability,
     even the classic Adventure was overtaken by successors.  The Zork
     series allows much more flexible syntax:  where Adventure permits
     permits only two words, a verb and a noun,  Zork will deal with a
     sentence such as: "Put the cake on the table."

             A few words of caution:  it's very easy to make adventure
     writing an ego trip: putting in clues that nobody will be able to
     solve if they aren't "in." Players tire very quickly of a game if
     they feel that it's not a challenge, just an exercise to show how
     clever the writer is.  On the other hand,  an adventure shouldn't
     be a dull recital.  Nothing is more booring than proceeding along
     and  killing  everything in sight.  Maybe your strength will give
     out, or maybe you'll make it through, but there's little exercise
     for the mind here.

             I recall having a  discussion  with  an  adventure-writer
     about non-violent adventures.  The idea was that you couldn't get
     killed  or  hurt,  and  couldn't  lose the game.  The thought was
     laudable,  but the game was  a  little  dull;  if  you  knew  you
     couldn't fail, you didn't have the same motivation.  In contrast,
     a  preschool  game  called  Thirsty Nellan offers challenge and a
     good interest level.

             Educators have told me that adventure games make a  major
     contribution  to  reading skills.  Kids who are almost illiterate
     will learn to read better in order to  understand  the  adventure
     situations ... and will learn to spell better.  After all, if you
     want  to  take the necklace and type TAKE NECKLISS,  the computer
     won't give you the booty.

                              FIDO Bug Reports
                            Killing Fido's Fleas


     The amount of reports has steadily been increasing,  however most
     reports  are  due  to sysop error or some type of set-up problem.
     However, this week a serious problem was detected, but the report
     reached me in a round-about fashion - delaying getting the report
     to Tom Jennings.  If you find a problem with FIDO, please send it
     direct to either 1/98 or 1/99 - do not send it to 1/0 or  any  of
     the  help  nodes  -  this  just delays the process of getting the
     reports to the correct source.


     Problem:  You can attach FILES.BBS as a netfile and it overwrites
              the present FILES.BBS; Tom's response:


     File attach of FILES.BBS: yes, that does happen. I don't consider
     it  a  bug,  per  se.  File  attach  is  sysop only,  for tons of
     reasons,  such as accountability,  legal file limit  checks,  etc
     etc.  This is one of those; the whole philosophy of Fido's design
     is that the sysop has complete power,  and only users are limited
     in what they can do.  Moral: with power comes responsibility.


     Problem: File Transfer name was described incorrectly, mixup with
              MODEM7 and BATCH; Tom's response:

     FILEXFER.HLP:  yes,  that's  an  oversight,  I had not thought of
     that.  I would suggest the easiest solution  is  for  sysop's  to
     edit.  I'll change my distribution copy here also.


     Problem: Problem with specific modems; Tom's response:

     My  position on modems is:  if its not specifically listed in the
     manual as supported,  problems with it are not my responsibility.
     This is a classic example why. Supposed "Hayes compatible" modems
     aren't  ,  I  warned  against  this heavily in the manual.  It is
     unfortunate,  but I can't do anything about it.  Obviously it  is
     returning  a  funny  result  code.  I  bet there is a simple work
     around,  maybe an ATXn command,  to eliminate  the  funny  result
     code. Put them into the usual FIDOMDM.BBS. The Hayes 1200 returns
     only 1 CONNECT,  2 RING,  3 NO CARRIER or 5 CONNECT 1200.  Others
     return BUSY, VOICE, etc, so this modem is returning non- standard
     result codes,  and hence is NOT Hayes compatible.  I will  repeat
     my standard blab, which you can pass on: "AT commands do not make
     a Hayes compatible modem."


     Problem:  The  scheduler  is  not  starting  up  at  event #1 and
              scanning the list down; Tom's response:
     Fidonews                     Page 11                  12 May 1986


     I'm not sure what is happening with the event stuff.  It  was  my
     understanding  as  well that it should find the first runable one
     in the list, ie. the lowest numbered event.  Unless there is some
     bug,  it's probably operator error.  Make sure the event is not 0
     length,  etc.  OH  YES,  there  is  a bug ....  it has to do with
     midnight.  Events over the midnights  edge  (00  o'clock)  aren't
     noticed  until after midnights.  i.e.  a user calling in at 11 pm
     wont be notified of an event running at 12:01 am.  The  scheduler
     will have the same limitation.  Ahh ...  the control flow used to
     select the next runable event is NOT straightforward  ...  it  is
     extremely complex,  and even worse, undocumented.  It makes sense
     most of the time, and was chosen (ie. it grew) to cover 99.99% of
     all cases,  and except for the midnight bug,  works well.  With a
     few exceptions.  My advice:  fiddle it until it works.  I hate to
     say!  The scheduler has some subtle problems to get around,  such
     as the aforementioned overlapping events,  and tries to do things
     in the order a person would do them, not necessarily in the order
     you think a dumb machine would do them in.  Oh well,  if its  not
     one thing its another ...

     Problem: Kermit Transfer continued:

     KERMIT  BUG:  If  8  bit  quoting  is  enabled,  and  exactly two
     successive 7e hexes are found in the data, uploading to Fido will
     treat them as a repeat count prefix and wreck the data.  There is
     a fixup file by a sysop or  user  called  FIDOKFIX,  but  I  have
     repaired  the  code  and  the  next revision will have it working
     correctly.

                             Notes from Abroad

                           The Never Ending Story
                                     by
                               Helge Vindenes

     I have just read what Frank wrote about the Dataflex  Modem,  and
     being  the  one  who  jumped  on a plane to London to pick up the
     modem,  I feel I have to share some of  my  experience  with  the
     modem with you.

     The  Dataflex Modem is everything that it claims to be,  and when
     it says that it is totally Hayes compatible,  then  it  is  true.
     But  there  is  one  BIG bug and that bug means that the modem is
     useless outside UK.

     The reason is that when someone calls my Fido and then  hangs  up
     the  phone  before  they are logged in to the Fido or if they log
     off before my modem has disconnected them,  then the modem  takes
     hold  of  the  dial tone and believes that the tone is a carrier.
     It can then hang on the dial tone for years.  Perhaps it  is  not
     correct  to  call it a bug,  it is rather an error because of the
     difference in British telephone system and the  one  we  have  in
     Norway and most other places in Europe.

     In  UK  you  can pick up the phone and if you don't start dialing
     within 30 seconds the dialing tone will disappear  and  telephone
     will be dead.  And then the problem is over for the English.  The
     modem  will  disconnect  and everything is ok.  But in Norway and
     Holland,  if you don't start dialing after 30 or 40 seconds  then
     you will have the occupied tone from the phone and Dataflex takes
     that one for a carrier as well.  And then there is only one thing
     to do: switch the computer off and then on again.  And if it is a
     lucky  day  then  you have to repeat this operation ten or twenty
     times.

     I have talked with Bob Manekshaw about this  problem  and  he  is
     working  on  it.  I  hope  to hear from him soon.  But until this
     thing has been fixed I think you should wait if you are  thinking
     about buying a Dataflex modem.

     Conclusion:  As  soon  as the above mentioned problem is solved I
     will strongly advise you to order a Dataflex modem.  It  is  well
     designed  and  the  documentation  is  good.  And  I  wouldn't be
     surprised if Dataflex would come with a 1200 2400 FD modem before
     next summer.  If not,  I guess I have to buy a ticket to USA  and
     get a US Robotic.


     * I'm  afraid  many  of  us  in the UK have the same problem,  me
       included.  I too have to reset  the  modem  when  this  problem
       occurs.  When  I  spoke  to  British Telecom about this problem
       they suggested that I have my lines changed to ones that cannot
       make outgoing calls......

                                  WANTED
     =================================================================

     Thomas Kenny, 107/316

     I'm very interested in ECHOMAIL networking.  I know this is a can
     of worms,  since some (many?) think  ECHOMAIL  may  (will?)  ruin
     FidoNet. Well I'm open minded and think it just might work out.

     Now  to  finally  get to the point.  I've been on a few different
     FIDOs across the country and have  discovered  that  the  use  of
     ECHOMAIL is much more widespread then I originally thought!  I've
     seen  several interesting topics being networked,  but would have
     never known about them.  Since there is nobody (as far as I know)
     acting as an ECHOMAIL coordinator  I'd  like  to  volunteer.  I'd
     like  to  do  two  things.  1  Find  out which Sysops are running
     ECHOMAIL and for what topic.  2 Create a wishlist registry.  This
     way  if  a  Sysop  wants to network an ECHOMAIL topic or generate
     interest in a new ECHOMAIL topic there will be a  clearing  house
     for such an activity!

     I  ask  everybody  that is reading this to please send me FidoNet
     mail if you:

     1  Are a sysop running ECHOMAIL (what topic & routing),

     2  know of a system running ECHOMAIL (what net/node & topic),

     3  wish there was somebody else that  shared  a  common  interest
        (what topic).

     Thank you very much, Thomas Kenny, Metatek FIDO, 107/316.

     of  software,  from text editors to games to unprotection schemes
     to communications programs, compilers, interpreters, etc...

     This collection is the result of more than 10 months of intensive
     downloads from just about 100 or more BBS's  and  other  sources,

     convenience.  Starting a Bulletin Board System?  Want to  add  on
     to your software base without spending thousands of dollars? This
     is the answer!!!

     As an answer to the difficulties of playing Avalon Hills  premier
     board game,  Diplomacy, either over a table or by US Mail, a Fido
     board dedicated to the game is now in operation.


                              - THE DIPLOMAT -

                                Fido 124/109

                                 2400 baud

     In the interests of learning from others,  we are soliciting  any
     information  on  previous games played by electronic mail.  Items
     of particular interest are:

            - Where was the game (City, board, network)?

            - Who played?

            - Who judged the game? (a program?)

            - What kind of time table did was used?

            - What did you like most (and least) about the game?

     If you have any information at all, or if you would like to apply
     to play in the first game (tentative start 5/21/86),  please send
     FidoMail to BRYNY at Net 124/109.

     Mike Hamilton, 103/510

     Due to several occurrences of violation of privileges here on the
     West Coast it has become necessary to request the following  help
     from  our  fellow  SYSOPS.  On  several occasions my name and the
     name of Glenn Bowes have been used in attempts  to  break  in  to
     other  systems  or  used as the logging in names to leave obscene
     files or messages on other boards.

     In an attempt to protect us all we make the following request.

     Please remove the following two occurrences of users from any and
     all boards on which it occurs:

          NAME                  Password             City
     Mike Hamilton               MIKE             Garden Grove,CA or
     Fidonews                     Page 20                  12 May 1986


                                                  Anaheim,CA

     Glenn Bowes                 DELTA            Torrance,CA or
                                                  Anaheim,CA

     If you feel this is too drastic a measure  for  your  board  then
     please  advise us individually where we are logged in by net mail
     direct to our boards. Mine is 103/501. Glenn's is 102/104.

     I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused but we can
     put the blame directly on other sysops for making this necessary.
