                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================


     Before I get to the  subject,  let me remind you that the FidoNet
     vote is approaching.  You would  be  doing  us  all  a service by
     voting.  Vote either for or against  IFNA,  but just PLEASE vote.

     Now down to the reason I called you here. As  some of  you  might
     have noticed, I am involved in a few things in and around FidoNet
     besides editing the Newsletter.   The result is a constant battle
     (at  least  within  my  mind)  between    all    of    my  varied
     responsibilities.  I think I'm smart enough  to  avoid  overload.
     I'm not completely sure, but I think so.

     That's why I'm typing this.   I am finding this expanded "Current
     Versions"  section  to  be a big load.    I  am  getting  several
     messages a week and often forget to go back and check them before
     putting out the newsletter.  Requests come in for  information on
     where some of this stuff can be gotten. And so on.

     Frankly, I haven't the slightest idea where you can get  most  of
     the non-IBM stuff.  And I also don't have any time  to  find out.
     What  that tells me is that I need some help in keeping  all  the
     info straight.

     Can anyone out there give me a hand?  I need someone to represent
     IBM,  Mac,  Amiga,  and  ST for starters.  If I wind up with more
     than one  person to do the job, then you'll have to work with the
     others.  I'll  publish  what you guys give me and stay out of the
     business myself. What a deal.

     If you're interested in the job, apply to 1:1/1. FidoNews  is  an
     equal opportunity employer.

     Thom Henderson
     c/o 1:107/528@FidoNet

                       Open Response to Charlie Smith
                    (a copy of which has been netmailed)


     You  ask,  "Why  does  IFNA  have  to  govern FidoNet?  Why can't
     FidoNet govern FidoNet?" This, I think,  succinctly reflects much
     of  the  confusion  many  people have about what has happened and
     what is now going on.

     IFNA is often perceived by many people as being a  thing  outside
     of  FidoNet,  when in fact it has always been very much a part of
     FidoNet.  It is and has always been the legal  representation  of
     FidoNet.

     FidoNet  has  no  existance  under  the  laws  of the land.  Does
     FidoNet exist?  Yes, of course it does, but how?  As an idea?  As
     a phone book?  As a group of people who share some  common  goals
     and/or  techniques?  All  of  those are true,  and more.  But the
     laws recognize none of them.  The laws (and the  government,  and
     the IRS,  and other organizations) recognize only people.  Either
     flesh-and-blood people (born of men and women,  heir to death and
     taxes),   or   "incorporated   people"   (born   of  lawyers  and
     accountants, potentially immortal, but still heir to taxes).

     If FidoNet is to relate to society around it  in  any  meaningful
     way,  it  must  have some corporate existance.  The original most
     pressing impetus for the formation of IFNA  is  a  good  example.
     Ken  Kaplan  was  accepting  donations  and incurring expenses on
     behalf of FidoNet -- but in the eyes of the IRS FidoNet does  not
     exist,  so  the contributions all counted as part of his personal
     income,  and the expenses all counted as non-deductible  personal
     expenses  for  his  hobby.  Likewise  today  the  Electronic Mail
     Association will not and cannot recognize "FidoNet" as  something
     that it can interact with, except through the IFNA.

     The whole point of IFNA is not to "govern" FidoNet, but to act as
     the  sysops'  vehicle for furthering FidoNet.  It was created and
     exists for the purpose of giving the sysops of FidoNet a means to
     do the things which cannot be done without  a  recognized,  legal
     entity  --  a  corporation.  This  can  be anything from handling
     money and expenses in a way that won't subject individual  sysops
     to  unnecessary  tax  burdens,  to  holding copyrights on FidoNet
     publications, to signing contracts with hotels for conferences.

     Your  question  was  phrased  somewhat differently once before by
     someone else,  and I think I'm ready to answer that earlier  form
     as well.  It was stated as a pair of questions:

       * What would FidoNet do without IFNA?

         It would go on much as before.  The mail  would  still  flow,
         the  node  list  would  still be published.  Then,  sooner or
         later  (probably  sooner),   someone  trying  to  set  up   a
         conference  would  discover  that  the  hotel  expects him to
         personally guarantee that 80 rooms will be  booked,  or  some
         coordinator will discover that he himself owns his portion of
         the  nodelist and is held personally liable for its accuracy,
         or someone  will  discover  that  recovering  his  costs  for
         echomail  distribution  has  just  made his taxes go up.  And
         then they will realize that they need a corporation in  order
         to  do  the  things we want to do,  and we'll start down this
         same road once again.

       * What would IFNA do without FidoNet?

         FidoNet  exists  today,  so for IFNA to exist without FidoNet
         something must happen to make FidoNet cease  to  exist.  Most
         likely  that  would  be  a  change in the laws such that what
         we're doing is no longer legal (which can  happen),  or  such
         that  too  many  key people drop out at once and things break
         down.  Or whatever,  the answer is the same in any case.  Fix
         the  problem  or  work  around it,  and start FidoNet back up
         again.


     In  most cases the need for a corporate entity in FidoNet has not
     been apparent,  because it's been there.  IFNA  still  holds  the
     copyright on the FidoNet nodelist and other FidoNet publications.
     Technical  standards  are  still maintained,  and every year like
     clockwork there is a FidoCon recognized  by  all  as  the  annual
     convention.  Bills get paid,  pamphlets get mailed out, and phone
     calls get answered.  If IFNA ceases to be FidoNet's legal  entity
     (for  whatever  reason),  then  a  vacuum  will  be created,  and
     something else will be formed to take its  place.  The  edges  of
     that vacuum are already being felt -- since the disastrous bylaws
     changes  last February there have been people saying that FidoNet
     needs a corporate entity.  We already have one -- we  should  fix
     it and use it.


     You  ask  me  to call off the referendum.  That I cannot do.  For
     good or ill,  that decision was made by the Board  of  Directors,
     and I cannot change it.

     And  I  would not,  even if I could.  Whether or not I personally
     agree  with  this  referendum  is  beside  the  point.  IFNA  has
     suffered too much in  the  past  from  vacillation  and  wavering
     resolve  caused  by  the  complaints  of  a  few  in  the various
     conferences.  I call that the "one flame,  one  vote"  principle,
     and  it  is  time  and  passed time for that to end.  The members
     FidoNews 6-43                Page 4                   23 Oct 1989


     elected a Board,  and the Board  voted,  and  the  result  was  a
     decision to have the sysops of FidoNet vote on the future of IFNA
     and  FidoNet.  That is democracy.  Changing course to satisfy and
     handful of people who complain in conferences is  not  democracy,
     it is pandering to the few at the expense of the many,  and it is
     high time for it to stop.

     The EcoNet Echo: A Plea for Participation         1:125/7

         Sometimes this net we've built just bloody  amazes me.
     Most often  it's in a good way;  right now it is by  it's
     indifference.....namely  the lack of participation in the
     Ecology echo. When I first got involved with FidoNet about
     four years ago it seemed like an incredible tool to bring
     about change. Nothing  earth shaking was expected  and I
     believe some of the echos have done good, such as the Dis-
     abled, Vietnam Veterans and medical ones. As important as
     ecological issues seem to be to the general populace the
     lack of interest in the Econet echo is curious if not sad.
          Are we so wrapped up in technology and this amazing
     community we've brought about that we're overlooking the
     problems of the world outside our door? Frankly since my
     wife delivered us a son my outlook has changed...ecology
     has  always been important to me and  thinking about the
     type of world  our child will inherit  has really changed
     my  outlook. A couple years  ago I linked into the Econet
     echo but dropped it after seeing  exactly 1 message in 2
     months. Recently I linked back in  and while  things are
     far better the echo is far from vital.
          I want to urge you, the sysops of the net, to carry
     the  echo, point out it's existance  to your callers and
     help us give it a  chance to thrive. The  echo is listed
     as being on the backbone hence should be easy to pick up
     and cheap to carry (1 message a day now). Maybe it will
     make a difference to our world and maybe it won't but it
     couldn't hurt to try....

     of Students, Staff and Faculty, everyone is welcome to
     participate in or initiate discussions related to Higher
     Education. For example, a person might wish to ask a
     question about a particular institution that he/she is
     thinking about enrolling at in the future.  The subject
     matter is wide open so it will be up to the participants
     to get the ball rolling on this echo.

     The only restrictions that presently apply to the use of
     this echo are: The language used must be clean and the
     discussions legal.

     IFNA Bylaws and Rules Committee
     John Roberts, 1:385/49, Chairman

     We're working feverishly to have a reasonably solid draft for the
     proposed Policy in place by the 1 November deadline, and it's
     actually beginning to look like we might make it.  We're to the
     point, and enough in agreement, that I thought it would be
     appropriate to at least mention the direction we're taking at
     this time.

     What we're working toward is the creation of a Policy document
     that is flexible enough to change with the needs of FidoNet, and
     solid enough to provide a good foundation for future changes to
     meet those needs.  To do this, we've taken leave of the method
     used for previous Policy documents, and taking a modular approach
     in that we're developing a basic document that covers the minimum
     responsibilities for nodes within the network and coordinators at
     the various levels of the network.

     This gives the advantage of allowing for future extensions to
     Policy to be ratified by the sysops of the network (that's you)
     on an item by item basis, rather than the "all or none, take it
     or leave it" method.  In other words, individual sysops will be
     able to have a much more effective voice in things that directly
     affect their operation within the network.

     The down side of this is that there's going to be more work for
     the Bylaws and Rules committee members to do, in that they'll
     have to review each proposed addition or amendment for conflicts
     with both the basic document and/or other existing or proposed
     additions or amendments, and recommend changes to the originators
     so as to avoid such conflicts.  Even so, we believe it will be
     worth it in the long run if it will help put the individual sysop
     back in control of his network.

     If you'd like to get more directly involved in this, you're
     invited to establish links to the IFNA_POL conference.  At
     present, it's available from 1:107/323 in EchoMail format, and
     from 1:385/49 in GroupMail format.  If you're not really
     interested in setting up links for yet another conference, but
     you do have something that you'd like to have considered, simply
     send NetMail to me, John Roberts, at 1:385/49 and I'll see that
     it gets into the conference for consideration and discussion.
     Please make sure that any such message doesn't have the "Private"
     bit set, as I'll only be cross-posting public messages.

     As I mentioned, we're shooting at that 1 November completion
     deadline.  With any luck at all, you should be able to read the
     proposed Policy draft in Fido645.Nws.

     Well the  purpose  of this file is to try and esatblish who is in
     what zone (ie  BBSNet  zone  86,  Eggnet  zone  99,  and Fidonet,
     whatever zone they feel  like  taking.)  This is a simple list of
     what claims what zone.   No  descriptions becuase Frankly I don't
     know anything about them.  As it stands now anybody can be in any
     zone, and with the sudden expansion of  nets  things will one day
     get pretty tight around the BBSland.  [The  real reason is that I
     have no users on my BBS and needed something  to  do] If multiple
     nets exsist in one zone I seperated them with a  /  Easy  enough.
     Later versions will include ZC and IC and such.

     Well need I say anything? I didn't think so.

     Alternet 7
     Well  Alternet is set up along a Dukedom type topology.   Of  all
     the  nets  it is the only one that I know of at  this  time  that
     charges.   I  have  heard  that  the  cost is anywhere from 20-35
     dollars.  ZC:

     RBBSNet 8
     Well I know  nothing  as  of  yet on this net.  Any info would be
     gladly accpeted.

     The Network 8
     Formerly known as FamilyNet.   Rules for this one are sparse, but
     I feel provides its strength.    All  member  boards  must be 'G'
     rated.  Basically, as its origional  title said, Family oriented.
     INFO:  Bob Hoffman 129/

     Pheonix Net 9:
     Nothing known. But as RBBSnet I would like to know more.

     Pizzanet 13
     Free delivery.  A small net built  around three echos.  It has no
     known  rules, except all systems must be free.    No  charges  to
     users  or  delivery  of  mail.(outside of what the Phone  company
     charges.)

     Zone 23 QBBSNet.
     Well It died.  So it is no more.  But it did consist of basically
     only Quickbbs's.

     INSANEt 23
     Well after  several  zone  changes,  and  several  name  changes.
     INSANEt is here.    It  deals  with  the say,well er..  It is the
     network with Spiked hair.    Want  totally off the wall messages.
     It can be had here.
     INFO: Mac Druiadh   1:363/69

     SIGnet 25(Canada) 26 (U.S.A.) 27.
     Have no idea, though I  am  still  awaiting more info.  More INfo
     Well There is a board in  Canada.    But the nearest one would be
     Glen Barnhardt      1:137/201

     I.F.N.A. Net 25?
     International Fidonet Association.  It is a  private  net  I  saw
     mentioned once.  More info would be liked very much.....

     DREAMNet 41, 42. and probobly 43
     From out of the ashes of QBBSNet.   Comes  DREAMnet.  The purpose
     is to basically build the best BBS program around,  ZXBBS.   More
     INFO Chris West     1:137/200

     GUIDONet
     A net built around one echo.  GUIDO.  GUIDO  is  also  carried by
     EGGNet,  so  if the one very basic rule of Guidonet bothers  you.
     You  can  get  it elsewhere.  The one basic rule is GUIDO  is  in
     charge.   No  Matter  what.    I  think  it solves the problem of
     Democracy.  Don't you?

     KINKNet 69
     I am still trying on this one.  If you know anything let me know.

     LCRnet 77
     Well.  I  just got the nodelist, and I forgot to ask the purpose.
     So....  I will get back to you on this one.

     BBSNet 86
     Well When Fido started  having trouble, two alternative nets were
     born.    EGGNet and BBSNet.    Still  awaiting  policy,  but  the
     potential is there.
     INFO Mike  Talbert  1:137/18
          Amelia  Hudson 1:137/14

     EGGnet 99
     The second alternate network.  This one  follows  the  policy  of
     everything is put before the individual sysop.   There  is no ZC,
     but  a  council  of three.  and a seperate  justice  system
     INFO Arlene Oakes   1:137/1000
          Glen Barnhardt 1:137/201

     Treknet 223
     Need I say more?  Actually I can't.  I saw someone claim the zone
     and that was the last I heard.  If you know let me know.

     Ok..  What I didn't know I left out.  This  does  not claim to be
     an  accurate  list.  I am not an accurate person.  There  are  no
     expressed warranties in  conjunction with this list, and use only
     as directed.  Now:    If  you find an error with this list, or an
     ommission(sp) on my part please  correct  me.  That is why I made
     this.  I will put forth  New  list  numbered accordingly when new
     Data is recieved.  What I like  to  get  is, the Zone of the net,
     the Name and the Coordinator,and any bit of  info about that net.
     Where I can be reached!  Well understand I  wanna  join nets.  It
     is  my goal to be in alot.  Nothing better  to  do  so  why  not.
