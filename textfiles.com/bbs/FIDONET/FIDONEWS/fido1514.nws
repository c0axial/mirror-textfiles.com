     Ah, don't you love the smell of burnt monitors in the morning?

     The current 'scorched earth' policy that is resounding through
     Zone 1 echoes has been accented by the uninvited appearance of
     Ward Dossche, the Z2C, into a Zone 1 administrative echo,
     making comments on how he sees Zone 1 being operated.

     Funny...he has the time to do this, but not enough time to vote
     in a new International Coordinator.  How so very odd.

     It seems a loud and vocal contingent has descended on the
     echoes, portraying themselves as 'saviours' or 'champions'...
     and really doing little more than making accusations and
     innuendo, based mostly on edited comments and misquotes, as
     well as self-regenerating myths.  In general, just 'bashing'
     under the guise of a 'moral cause'.

     To be fair, your Editor has also been accused of doing the
     same...but then again, he has never declared himself to be
     the 'saviour' or 'champion' of anything but his own beliefs.

     And so, when you see the comments about how I have "biased"
     or "twisted" the FidoNews, consider that the only real part
     I have any input into is this small corner called the
     "editorial"...and how the rest of the text is only those
     submissions that members of FidoNet have presented for
     publication or the 'boilerplate' that is in any publication.

     I guess that's their way of saying that *everyone* in Fido is
     "biased" and "twisted"...especially since they can't come up
     with any explanations on _how_ I've achieved this 'goal'.

     Funny thing though...what purpose does this 'scorched earth'
     policy *really* serve in what is _supposed_ to be a hobby?

     Hmmmmm?

     In this issue, a word from Chris Baker which we might all wish
     to look at; another view from only one side of the story by Doc
     Logger; Ward Dossche's 'doomsday' countdown, and a bona fide
     article on a subject that it seems no one really pays attention
     to anymore (HINT:  It's called "BBSing".)

     BBS? I Was Calling Granny!
     The hidden treasures of Bulletin Board Systems...
     by Robert Short [NetMail - 1:105/38 E-mail - bsbbs@juno.com]

     OK, your wait times are unbearable at Almost On Line, and now you
     have nothing to do except play Duke 3D and Doom. You're just dying
     for more online time --but what are you going to do, subscribe to
     a second ISP? Or, you've just spent 6 hours on the World Wide Wait,
     finding and downloading the latest version of Quake, but it's too
     late at night to try it. How about logging on to a home page and
     sweating it out while downloading a dozen images -- so you can jump
     to yet another page or two? Ah, the Internet! Well, maybe the I-Net
     isn't quite that bad. With the proper filtering software or parental
     direction, it can be a safe, educational and entertaining experience
     for children. For adults, the World Wide Web can be an invaluable
     tool to access programs and support for both personal and business
     needs, creating a new marketing revolution. Another Dimension

     There's another dimension to cyberspace that they don't mention at
     the omputer store, one that can provide many of the same features as
     the Internet and some that it doesn't. It not the intention of this
     article to make comparisons or to infer that one is better than the
     other, as both are unique in their own ways. Rather I write hoping
     to educate the reader to an aspect in telecommunications that has
     served the community since before the World Wide Web was conceived,
     and has been somewhat overshadowed by the highly publicized and
     popular Web. This alternative is the "Bulletin Board System" (BBS),
     an online service offering a wide variety of online games, files,
     one-on-one chat, message areas, private mail, and participatory
     forums. All this can be found at many of the local BBSs via the
     communications software that came bundled with your operating system
     HyperTerminal for Window 95, Terminal for Win 3.x).

     There are many different styles of Bulletin Board Systems; each BBS
     is customized in form and appearance by its system operator, the
     person known as the SysOp. Boards range in size from those operating
     over a single telephone line from a home PC to full-featured, multi-
     line systems run on a local area network. Their look and feel can
     range from straight black-and-white text to 256-color SVGA graphics.
     Many BBSs charge you nothing to call and offer 30-60 minutes access
     per day, while others might charge a nominal subscription fee to
     access the more popular features like multi-user chat or CD-ROM
     files areas, or to allow you more daily online time. Still others
     might offer full-fledged (and fee-based) Internet access in addition
     to their standard BBS services. The majority of these boards are
     operated by computer hobbyists who put their time, equipment and
     money at the disposal of the community simply for the joy of doing
     so. Quite often, the SysOp will run his BBS to promote a special
     area of interest, while others have a more general appeal.

     One of the most enticing aspects of BBSs is the personal attention
     FIDONEWS 15-14               Page 3                    6 Apr 1998


     many SysOps give to their callers. Some even go out of the way to
     help their users with software and hardware problems, making them a
     valuable resource for technical assistance and advice. Opening an
     account is as easy as calling and answering a few simple questions.
     Most fee-based BBSs offer a free trial period to give you a feel for
     the system before subscribing. Free boards often have a Call Back
     Verifier which calls your computer to check your phone number and
     then automatically validates your account. Once a member, you will
     become part of a family of users who consider their favorite BBS a
     place to meet, play, share programs and ideas, and an indispensable
     resource for sending messages across town or around the world. At
     your BBS, you can truly enjoy a sense of closeness and community.
     SysOps often host gatherings where members can meet one another.

     As mentioned above, there can be many activities available on BBSs
     that inform and inspire, entertain and enhance. Offering relatively
     safe alternatives to some areas of the Internet, BBS SysOps usually
     require phone number verification, real names for the user records
     (though aliases might also be allowed) and, where access to adult
     material is available, proof of age and sex. These requirements seek
     to guarantee a comfortable environment for both men and women,
     children and adults. It is not uncommon to see users ages 8 to 80.

     Here are the features found at many BBSs in the your area. You're
     bound to find something enlightening on your very first call.

                                    Messages

     This was the main feature when BBSs appeared, hence the name
     Bulletin Board System. In message areas you can easily place or read
     an advertisement or announcement, post a question or answer, or
     browse through hundreds of specialized subject areas for interesting
     information. If your BBS is connected to a network of systems such
     as FidoNet, most messages will be "echoed" around the globe to some
     50,000 other BBSs which pass messages and files via telephone line,
     satellite and the Internet. If you have problems with hardware or
     software, you'll find that many computer companies and programmers
     visit these message areas to answer questions and offer support.
     There are currently over 700 FidoNet echoes (topic areas) that cover
     more than 500 subjects.

                                     Files

     The local BBS is a great place to download the latest shareware,
     freeware, and public domain software. You will often have download
     privileges on your first call, and the compressed files you download
     are easily uncompressed with a variety of freeware or shareware
     unzipping programs. If your primary connection to the Internet is
     via modem, you're in for a couple pleasant surprises. First, file
     transfers from a BBS typically proceed more quickly than modem-based
     FTP (file transfer protocol) downloads from the Internet because
     you're not sharing the data line between you and the file source
     with anyone else. Or, maybe you've had a multi-megabyte transfer
     interrupted toward the end of the download. With FTP, all you can
     do is start over again. On the other hand, BBS's usually support
     download protocols that allow you to pick up where left off --
     FIDONEWS 15-14               Page 4                    6 Apr 1998


     without having to re-download what's already on your system.

                                    Chat

     Multi-line BBSs may offer user chat, or even "forums" where any
     number of people can gather to discuss common issues. Once online,
     you can usually see a list of users who are also online and page
     someone for one-on-one chat, or invite them to a private chat room.
     This feature can really help to instill a sense of "family" and
     belonging.

                                   E-mail

     Where some smaller systems may have private e-mail strictly between
     users on that BBS, others might have mail across their network
     (NetMail), or even give you an Internet e-mail address. The SysOp
     may allow file attachments, enabling you to mail shareware games
     to a friend just like over the Internet.

                                 Telnet  FTP

     If you join a board with multiple lines and an Internet connection,
     you'll have the ability to call out to other BBSs. This allows you
     to log on to another telnet-able BBS, anywhere in the world, with no
     long-distance phone charges. A multi-line BBS can also utilize open
     lines to access FTP sites, where you can obtain files that might not
     otherwise be available locally. Coupled with the home system's file
     bases, this creates an enormous resource for finding an unlimited
     variety of programs.

                                   Faxing

     Some systems have online fax capabilities that allow you to send a
     fax via the Internet, eliminating long-distance charges. This is
     usually as secure as sending e-mail.

                                 Doors/Games

     Last, but not least, are the ever-popular door games. Everything
     from Acey Deucy to Yahtzee can be played on a BBS. Card, dice,
     board, word search, adventure, and role-playing games abound. Even
     the new 3-D rendered games are possible at connections of 14,400
     BPS or higher. You play these games while online against a computer
     opponent or another caller. If your BBS has more that one line, you
     can play many of these head-to-head against another person online.
     There are also many information doors such as skiing and road
     conditions, electronic magazines, stock quotes, weather, horoscope
     and matchmakers.  Whether you are a kid stuck indoors on a rainy
     day, a mom with time between laundry loads, on lunch break at the
     office, disabled or retired, you are sure to get your fill of
     whatever sparks your interest at many of the locally run BBSs in
     your area. Why not strike up your modem and discover a whole new
     cyber-world right in your own back yard?

     This is an excerpt of a message I sent out a couple weeks ago to a
     select mailing list. There hasn't been any response so I'm going to a
     global audience [if anyone still reads FidoNews].

     It originally included an entire timeline of my adult life but that
     seemed pretty boring for this audience so just the pertinent data is
     included in this version.

     --- update ends ---

     thanks, for caring, and all the support during these dark days.

     now, if everyone who called and wrote offering cash would send all
     they can to me at:

       Christopher Baker
       P.O. Box 471
       Edgewater, FL  32132-0471

     then maybe i won't have to declare bankruptcy [i'm on a fixed
     disability income] to survive this betrayal. i'm using the P.O. Box
     instead of my street address because she has no access to that.

     i figure $20,000 should do it as i will be left with all the bills as
     well as the property not to mention psychiatric counseling for my son
     and myself [we've already started that at $100 a pop]. if i can get
     one dollar [or more if you can] from every Node in FidoNet, i'll be
     set since there are 23,000+ Nodes.  so here is my appeal to you in
     FidoNews.

     you can send moral support in lieu of cash if you think this request
     is too tacky [i certainly do]. [grin]

     you can also tell me to buzz off. i won't take it personally.

     thanks.

     QOFM.

     Dear Editorbeing,

     This article is submitted by Doc Logger (163/110) who
     labours in the bowels of Swamp Swine Magazine. The
     aforementioned organ can also be reached at
     cherriot@magmacom.com for those whose wish to submit
     PlainBrownWrapperMail(tm) about the foibles of the usual
     suspects.

     Roll da flic, Zorch....

     Dear Reverend Visage,

     Do you still have those recipes for Chevron that were so
     kindly given to you by Jackie Onassis' chef? The reason I
     ask is that Fidoland has been convulsed by a set of events
     which, no lie here, began with a horse story. You'll need to
     break open another cask of Laphroag so that you can
     appreciate the savage ugliness of the events. We may have to
     polish off our artistic licenses and restate the phrase:
     "Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely" with
     the new truism "Power makes you real stupid."

     Naturally, this is a saga involving Bob Kohl (R10C) who has
     gathered at least one admirer and enough detractors to
     repopulate the Bimini Atol. This week has seen the departure
     of both David Hallford R10EC and Mike Murray, NoCal Zhub.
     What is remarkable about both departures is that they have
     written declarations that they are leaving due to the odious
     machinations of Bob Kohl . In Hallford's case he cites an
     incident where Kohl demanded that Hallford remove an NEC
     from her position. Do you hear the hoofbeats yet, Visage?
     Was Kohl's reasoning due to the incompetence of the NEC?
     Nope. Was it for a policy violation? Nope. It
     was...incredibly, based upon Kohl's personal emnity towards
     the NEC because she had refused to provide free boarding for
     Kohl's horse. Due to Kohl's petty vindictiveness, Region 10
     lost two of their number who had been graciously providing
     echomail service to the other sysops.It is tempting to write
     that for want of a horse house, his kingdom was lost.

     When the rank odour of Kohl's weasellings became evident,
     one of the Region10 NCs sent out netmail to the other NCs
     inquiring whether they felt that Kohl still had their
     confidence to continue as the R10C. Much hilarity ensued
     when our very own Zorch Frezberg sent out a stern letter
     threatening a policy complaint because he felt the inquiry
     was posted from an ersatz address. Poor Zorch has no idea
     how much his cheesy attempts to stifle the discussion added
     to the legendary status of his buffoonery. Our prayers and
     our edible underwear should go out to him, and may the farce
     FIDONEWS 15-14               Page 9                    6 Apr 1998


     be with him. With Bob Kohl residing at Satti's feet in the
     Z1REGCON elflord echo, one can only imagine what the Great
     Minds can conjure in their attempts to circle the wagons and
     keep accountability at bay.

     Speaking of Bob Satti (Z1C) I see that he is plagued by
     embarrassing questions from Ward Dossche(Z2C) as to why Bob
     is so opposed to crediting the Zone 1 sysops with any
     intelligence. Dossche is asking that the selection of the
     new IC follow the lines of representative democracy. The
     prospect of allowing self-determination to the sysops must
     truly horrify Satti for it would surely mean the end of his
     own self-appointed reign.

     For this week's Chautauqua I would like to lead off with a
     quote from Thomas Paine taken from his "Rights of Man." For
     those unaware of Paine, he was a pamphleteer whose work
     "Common Sense" is judged to be the seminal work that spawned
     the American Revolution. "Rights of Man" (pub. 1790) is
     largely a response to Edmund Burke who had asserted the
     Divine Rights of Kings as the guiding principal for
     governance.

     "It has been thought that a considerable advance towards
     establishing the principles of Freedom, to say, that
     government is a compact between those who govern and those
     who are governed; but this cannot be true, because it is
     putting the effect before the cause; for as man must have
     existed before governments existed, there necessarily was a
     time when governments did not exist, and consequently there
     could exist no governors to form such a compact with. The
     fact therefore must be, that the *individuals themselves*,
     each in his own personal and sovereign right, *entered into
     a compact with each other* to produce a government: and this
     is the only mode in which governments have a right to arise,
     and the only principle on which they have a right to exist."

     I rather like this quote because if one were to substitute
     either "Policy 4" or "the *Cs" for each instance of
     "government" or "those who govern" it neatly points out the
     philosophical fallacy upon which the Z1/RCs have relied for
     their presumed powers. Policy4 was never ratified or voted
     upon by the "governed" who happen to be sysops. Those who
     assert that "we must follow policy" are certainly putting
     the effect before the cause. If Policy4 has any legitimacy
     (which it currently doesn't) it must manifest itself as a
     compact between sysops. The self-perpetuating ZC/RC
     appointment process is anathema to any notion of consensual
     governance.

     For those who joined Fidonet after its Halcyon days and
     after the founding principles were hijacked by brigands, the
     notion of reasserting the rights of sysops seems futile. I
     would humbly suggest that if there is any futility, it is in
     the expectation that sysops will collectively throw off
     cowardice and tell the *C elflords that we are not *ruled*
     FIDONEWS 15-14               Page 10                   6 Apr 1998


     at their leisure. The egregious excesses of the likes of
     Kohl, or the imperial pretentiousness of Swartz (R16C), only
     obtain credence because it is assumed that they control the
     nodelist. In point of fact, the nodelist and any rights to
     it, are vested in the sysops whose names appear in it. There
     is nothing on earth to prevent the nodelist from being
     compiled, collated and distributed from sources other than
     the ZC/RC's elflord lair. Just as they presume any power to
     intrude into the affairs of sysops, the elflords can be made
     irrelevant.

     I must go Visage. Your secretary is ululating at high
     decibels. Who would have thought that her humours would
     reach critical mass simply because the herd of water buffalo
     that you shipped to us have been stampeding all day. As the
     good and decent people that we are, we should send her
     immediately to Chadron, Nebraska.
