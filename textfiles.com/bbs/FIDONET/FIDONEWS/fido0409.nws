                             Editor Unleashed!

     I have a confession to make.  I've been holding back.

     You see,  somehow or other I found myself on the interim Board of
     Directors.  One  of  three in the limelight,  as it were;  one of
     three "targets" who gets to take the heat.

     It's been uncomfortable,  for a number of  reasons.  Mainly  it's
     been  uncomfortable by choice.  You see,  during the whole recent
     debate on the bylaws I felt that it would not be proper for me to
     comment on the proposed  bylaws  one  way  or  the  other.  Undue
     influence, and all that.

     But holding my tongue is an uncomfortable position -- for me more
     than  most,  I  suppose.  No  one  who  has  ever  known  me  has
     considered me reticent, so far as I'm aware.  But the election is
     past now, so I am free to speak my mind.  It may come as a bit of
     a surprise to a few people.

     I don't like the bylaws.

     They are more suited to a major nation or a multi-million  dollar
     corporation  than  to  us.  They  call  for  a 22 person Board of
     Directors,  which is ridiculous when you stop to think that  IFNA
     only  has  about  200 dues paying members.  They mandate a half a
     dozen or more standing committees,  most of which oversee  things
     that a single person could handle better.  Worst of all, they are
     incredibly paranoid!

     Here's  one example of paranoia.  The treasurer is not allowed to
     chose a bank to put the money in.  The Finance Committee  has  to
     recommend  a  bank,  and the entire board has to approve it.  All
     this for a few thousand bucks?  My own inclination is to leave it
     all up to the treasurer.  In short,  pick someone you trust,  and
     then  trust  him!  It'll be hard enough to find anyone willing to
     do the work anyway without hanging a dozen or so overseers on his
     neck.

     That's just one example out of many.  Read  the  bylaws.  Take  a
     good,  long look at them.  Does this sound like a bunch of sysops
     getting together, or Megacorp Inc?

     I've already shown  you  something  I  like  better,  though  you
     probably  didn't  know  it  was  me.  You probably didn't take it
     seriously either,  in spite of the fact that this is supposed  to
     be  FUN!  Why  do  we do it if it isn't fun?  Do you remember the
     alternate proposed bylaws for the Intergalactic FidoNet Alliance?
     I wrote them, and I was dead serious.

     The whole point of the Alliance was to remind us all that this is
     supposed to be  fun.  We're  doing  this  because  we  enjoy  it,
     Fidonews                     Page 3                    2 Mar 1987


     remember?  So why not adopt bylaws that will remind us of that?

     I've come to realize that even those bylaws were too restrictive.
     I plan on revising them (i.e.  chopping out even more manure) and
     publishing them again.  I'm hoping that I can at least get people
     to  use  different terms.  Why have a Board of Directors?  That's
     what businesses have.  Why not have a Council of  Lords  instead?
     I think "Grand Wizard" is a much better term than "Vice President
     of Technical Operations."  Instead of having a President, it'd be
     much  more  descriptive  of the actual job to call him a Whipping
     Boy.

     This  carries  through  to  other  areas  as  well.  The  FidoNet
     Technical  Standards  Committee  sounds  like  a  stuffy group of
     people bent on maintaining the status  quo.  But  call  them  The
     Ironmongers  Squad and it sounds like they have more room to play
     in.  Why have a Publications Committee  when  you  can  have  the
     Rumormongers  Squad?  The  Membership  Services  Committee sounds
     dull and boring;  the Graft and Vice Squad sounds like a LOT more
     fun!

     After all, isn't that what it's all about?

     I just got back from CES and  Commodore  did  not  show  the  new
     machines that I predicted they would.  Many people were upset and
     disapointed.  They  DID  however  have  the  new  machines there,
     tucked away upstairs  in  their  booth  under  guard.  They  were
     showing  them  to  a  few people (very few) and only after a very
     nasty and lengthy non-disclosure statement had been signed.

     Unfortunately, I had to sign one of those agreements before being
     permited up the magic stairs to mecca.  I can't go any more in to
     detail for obvious reasons and after all my word is my word  (and
     Commodore  hasn't  layed off their legal deptartment yet).  BUT I
     can tell you how I felt after I came back down the stairs.

     It was a lovely day in Las Vegas.  The kind of day that makes you
     feel wonderful.  The kind of day that makes you feel  good  about
     the  future.  The  NEAR  future.  I  looked  around the booth and
     thought about how it was going to be a very good spring for Amiga
     and a very bad summer for Tramiel & Sons.

     I listened to the people that were complaining about the lack  of
     new  hardware  at  the  Amiga booth and the plethora of new vapor
     machines at the Atari booth.  I thought about how smart it is for
     some companies to hold off announcing computers  until  they  are
     sure  of  delivery  dates.  How smart it is for some companies to
     try to turn around their reputations by delivering on  time  with
     new products.  I had a big dumb grin all over my face.  I thought
     about  how  wonderful it is that technology can march forward and
     yet compatability can be preserved.  I wish you had been there.

     I hope you've enjoyed my observations of Las Vegas.  Many of  you
     have committed your time and effort to making the Amiga a success
     with  no possibility of personal gain,  just because you believe.
     I think that you deserve  more  than  to  be  left  in  the  dark
     wondering  if  you've been abandoned.  I thought I'd do my what I
     could to let you know that all our futures are very,  very bright
     indeed.

     I'm  sorry  that  I can't go into more detail but keep the faith,
     Santa's just going to be a little late this  year  but  it'll  be
     worth the wait!

                           TJ and Fido Version 12

     I had another chat with TJ about V12 yesterday and found out that
     he has more problems,  unrelated to Fido development,  that  will
     unfortunately  cause  further delays.  He is leaving APPLE in mid
     January and going into business for himself.  He is moving into a
     San Francisco Warehouse with a number of others that will  double
     as a business office, and he is spending about one hour a week on
     V12  development,  which puts his current target date sometime in
     second quarter of '87.

     For those of us that have dealt with TJ over the past three years
     this is disappointing,  but not at all surprising.  For those  of
     you  beyond  the 1200 node table limit in Fido we are hoping that
     by telling the truth it will  light  a  fire  under  a  few  more
     FidoNet  clone  developers.  SEAdog already has the limit problem
     licked,  OPUS development should consider a FidoNet  Mail  clone,
     and  hopefully  others  will  follow  suit.  TJ  may prerelease a
     version of Fido with greater  than  a  1200  node  limit,  but  I
     wouldn't count on it happening very soon.

     All  I can suggest is that our friends in Regions 2 and 3 (Europe
     and Australia) not give up hope since they are the most adversely
     affected.  Encourage  new  developers  to  pick  up  the  FidoNet
     Standards Documents and offer to assist the current FidoNet clone
     developers when you find them.

     Reply to "Reply to Shareware Expenses"

     by Mark J. Welch, Fido 161/459 [private SEAdog node]
                       Berkeley, CA
                       (415) 841-8759 (voice)


     In the February 16, 1987 edition of FidoNews (Volume 4, Number 7,
     Page  8),   Jeff  Sheese  (Sysop,   THUD  BBS   [Opus],   110/10,
     513-890-0422  data)  posed  some  quite  understandable questions
     about whether my Shareware program,  the  Generic  Advenure  Game
     System  (GAGS),  has  really been as unprofitable as I said in my
     earlier FidoNews article.  I'd  like  to  reply  briefly  to  his
     comments  and  try  to explain how I do my accounting,  and why I
     charge some expenses to GAGS and other expenses to other things.

     Needless to say, I didn't post the categories and numbers without
     having solid defenses to  each  of  them.  If  I  was  stretching
     things,  I  wouldn't  publicize  the numbers since I already have
     strange enough returns that only the merest  luck  has  saved  me
     from scrutiny by the IRS.

     First off,  the easy stuff:  the expenses for books,  development
     software,  other software,  postage,  and supplies are,  in fact,
     strictly  limited to expenses related to GAGS.  Yes,  I did reuse
     the  compilers  and  some  of  the  books  in   other   [aborted]
     programming projects.  Heck, some of the books ended up not being
     useful at all.  The key is that I bought them for use  with  GAGS
     and  with  the  recognition  that  they  were for use as software
     development tools.  On the other  hand,  I  used  many  resources
     (about  $1,000 worth of books in my library and over $2,000 worth
     of software on the shelf,  for example) which were  paid  for  by
     other activities, but made no effort to retrospectively apportion
     their  value to GAGS.  [Those estimates on books and software are
     conservative:  anyone who wants to  challenge  those  numbers  is
     welcome to a copy of a list of the software on my shelf, and to a
     copy  of  the  list  of  over $1,000 worth of computer books I've
     proposed to donate to a local university library to make room  on
     my shelves for more books.]

     The  "Cost  of  Goods  Sold"  figure  includes  all  the  disks I
     manufactured and mailed, including free copies to the press, user
     groups, and many sysops,  and also includes mailing envelopes and
     such.  I have receipts for everything, and it's all genuine "cost
     of goods sold." It doesn't include postage, which is lumped under
     "postage"  along  with  all  other  postage  expenses  (including
     updates and press releases); the postage category doesn't exclude
     anything:  remember  that  each  disk costs just 39 cents to mail
     (except to Europe).

     The miscellaneous category, always suspicious, is also absolutely
     pure:   it  does  not  include  all  my  memberships  or  all  my
     subscriptions  even  to  computer magazines,  only those that are
     related to GAGS.  (It also includes other bizarre expenses.) I do
     not  (and legally cannot) take a separate tax deduction for these
     memberships or subscriptions.
     Fidonews                     Page 7                    2 Mar 1987


     The phone category so aggressively challenged by Mr. Sheese hurts
     most.  I established my bulletin-board in  an  effort  to  create
     goodwill  so  I could expand distribution of GAGS.  My BBS,  like
     BBSs sponsored by computer stores and other software  publishers,
     had other programs on-line, and I sent FidoMail mostly about GAGS
     but  also about lots of other things.  The BBS was established to
     support GAGS, and whenever conflicts occurred, GAGS won.  The BBS
     was instrumental in distributing GAGS:  FidoMail requests,  file-
     attaches (40 minutes on my dime),  and  regular  callers  allowed
     GAGS to become available nationwide in a matter of weeks.  When I
     realized that GAGS would never pay the BBS expenses,  I closed it
     down  (Fido 161/459 is a private SEAdog node to exchange FidoMail
     only), saving the expense of the second phone line which had been
     installed especially for GAGS and then relocated (a  second  $100
     installation charge) when I moved.

     Of  course,  I've  held the most controversial category for last:
     computer equipment.  The $2,400 in that category  is  essentially
     what  turns  an  otherwise nearly-breakeven operation into a huge
     loss.  Again,  I have other computer  equipment  here,  and  this
     equipment  was purchased for the single purpose of developing and
     supporting GAGS.  GAGS development and maintenance has  accounted
     for  far  more  than half of the system's use,  with GAGS-related
     business activity accounting for another quarter.  I have used it
     for  other  things,   and  those  "other  things"  (like  writing
     freelance  articles)  thus  are  not  properly  "charged" for the
     expense of the computer,  but neither is  GAGS  charged  for  the
     publicity  that  results from my writing nor for the hardware and
     software that predated  GAGS  or  was  acquired  for  some  other
     purpose.  Another  note:  the computer equipment for which I paid
     about $2,400 now has a resale value of about $500 to $750.

     When I buy another system this year, as I certainly will,  I will
     "charge"  it to some other activity,  even though I will probably
     use it part of the time for  GAGS-related  activities.  And  more
     than  likely,  I will spend even more on the new system.  (In the
     unlikely event that I sell the old system,  I would "credit" GAGS
     for  any  income  from  that;  I  credited  GAGS when I sold some
     equipment in 1985,  and that  credit  is  incorporated  into  the
     figures.)

     Mr.  Sheese is surely right about one thing that makes my numbers
     easy to challenge:  the "crossover effect" between activities  is
     substantial.  It goes even further:  I buy games for personal use
     (Starflight,  etc.),  and although  the  games  provide  me  with
     insight  into  game development I wouldn't dream of calling those
     purchases "expenses" for GAGS.  Of course,  neither do I allocate
     10 percent of the system cost because I spend that amount of time
     using  it to play games,  or 10 percent of the system time to the
     "enterprise"  of  being  a  BIX   [BYTE   Information   Exchange]
     moderator,  which  is a quite enjoyable but unprofitable thing to
     be.  Before 1985,  I spent  a  lot  of  time  developing  earlier
     programs  that  were ancestors of GAGS,  and GAGS wasn't "charged
     back" for those expenses.  Nor have I ever charged GAGS  for  any
     portion of my trade show expenses,  even though I spend a quarter
     to a third of my time talking to publishers and the  press  about
     Fidonews                     Page 8                    2 Mar 1987


     GAGS.  (I did charge GAGS for admissions to computer "swap meets"
     when I was shopping around for my XT clone.)

     My practice is to charge all  current  expenses  to  the  current
     projects.  All my software development expenses were "charged" to
     GAGS for the past 18 months because GAGS was  my  only  published
     product.  Those  aborted projects involved a total of perhaps ten
     percent of the system use.  Virtually all my computer  and  phone
     expenses  are  now  charged  to  my  freelance  writing activity,
     because it produces the most income and activity.


     For the IRS,  because the activities are so overlapping,  I  lump
     all  freelance  writing,  programming,  and consulting activities
     together as a single "enterprise," which lost a couple  grand  in
     1985  (because  of  GAGS) and made a fair amount of money in 1986
     (because of growing freelance writing income).  I broke  out  the
     GAGS  results  only  when  I was making the decision to move GAGS
     from Shareware to commercial distribution.


     So,  what does all this come down to?  I think the numbers I used
     are  very close to reality.  Surely,  if I sat down and allocated
     each fraction of an hour spent at the computer,  and computed the
     precise  market  value and cost of the hardware and software used
     to develop GAGS,  I could come up with a more secure number,  but
     I'm  confident  that the resulting number would be quite close to
     the loss I mentioned in my earlier article.

     Matt Giwer, The Pot of Gold (109/483)

                        An open letter to all SYSOP

          This is an open letter to all SYSOPs.  My  eleven  year  old
     son  managed  to  download  a  file probably called SEX.ARC which
     contained several rather crude  pornographic  animated  graphics.
     One  of the files was PORNO.EXE.  This file is possibly of German
     origin.

          OK.  I am not really excited  about  this.  At  that  age  I
     would  have downloaded it but also I might have been smart enough
     to keep it on a well hidden floppy.

          The point of this message is this.  If you think the GOV has
     been interested in cracking down on  BBSs  because  of  potential
     copyright  infringement,  just imagine what is going to happen if
     some parent reports this file to The Moral Majority.  Arguing the
     law is one thing,  arguing against a bunch of half-crazed puritan
     parents  is  another.  If  files  like this can be down-loaded by
     people who are not legal adults and it hit the papers,  BBSs  are
     asking for a crack-down that will not quit.

          Books have been banned and burned for less than this.

          Now legally, the person called and asked for the file and as
     such  I  think  that BBS operators are legally safe,  just as the
     phone call sex talk business is safe as long as the  buyer  calls
     for  the  service.  I  am  not  a lawyer but I think that this is
     correct.

          The problem is some Oral Roberts (may  he  not  collect  his
     $4.5M)  gets his hands on this and starts condemning all BBSs and
     all downloading because of one  or  two  files.  Those  kinds  of
     fools do that sort of thing.

          Please  pass this message on.  If you carry such files,  try
     to find a way to restrict access to 18 year olds.  At best do not
     carry such files at all.  If you carry sexually  oriented  files,
     then  do  you  best to screen out the gross ones -- the kind that
     will get public  attention.  Gross  is  what  gets  the  public's
     attention  and  no one will come to your defense.  If the file is
     artistically  interesting,  a  well  done  nude  then  fine,  the
     Liberals  will come to your defense and you will win politically.
     But crude porn has few defenders.

          Consider strongly,the control or removal of all crude/vulgar
     sexually oriented programs, particularly grafix programs.

          For further information,  and for the file if you want it as
     an example, you may contact me at 109/483.

          Note  that  I  will  not  upload  the file simply to have it
     listed for downloading.  This sort of thing should not be on  any
     board for the reasons stated above.

                       Tax Program Developers Heed!
                          by Ben Baker -- 100/76

          Someone  from  the  IRS  made an interesting statement in an
     interview I heard on the radio this morning on my way to work.

          If you develop and sell tax computation software, you are  a
     "tax  preparer"  in  the eyes of the IRS.  If a taxpayer's tax is
     understated because of an error in your software, YOU are subject
     to  a  "preparer's  penalty" ammounting to 75 % of the ammount of
     understatement.

          I know there are a lot of you out  there,  so  I  thought  I
     should  pass  along  this  interesting  little  tid-bit.   If you
     distribute your s/w as "shareware" via the  BBSs,  your  exposure
     could  be  quite  large,  so MAKE DAMN SURE ANY ERRORS ARE ON THE
     HIGH SIDE!

     =================================================================
                                  COLUMNS
     =================================================================

                      The First of an Irregular Column
                               Dale Lovell
                                 157/504

          Even before  I read  Thom Henderson's  comments on how small
     FidoNews was becoming, I noticed how there didn't seem to be that
     much in it anymore. I had been considering writing an irregularly
     appearing column,  but had  been putting  it off for a variety of
     reasons. When  I got and read FidoNews this week (Volume 4 Number
     7) I  decided it  was time  to finally do something. If things go
     well, I should be sending off at least one column every month. If
     anyone can  come up  with a  cute, catchy name for it let me know
     because I  haven't been able to think of anything. I'll be giving
     everyone my  views and  opinions on events, software and hardware
     that come  to my attention. If you have any comments on my column
     either write  an article  for FidoNews or send me a message, I'll
     try to go over any netmail in the end of future columns. That out
     of the way, on to the column.

          Finally got  a copy  of the  Microsoft C  last week and have
     been looking over the docs and playing around with it. First off,
     I didn't  believe what  anybody had to say about Codeview and was
     surprised. It really is a great program. For the first time I was
     able to  watch the  program execute (in my C source code) and the
     programs output  at the  same time.  Even back in the days when I
     used BASIC  I couldn't  do it  this  easy.  Since  I've  got  two
     monitors I  had one  monitor tracing  the program  and the  other
     "running" the  program. For  a lot  of people that alone might be
     worth the price of the compiler.

          Another thing that I noticed much earlier is the size of the
     documentation. Microsoft  gives it  to you  in 3  of the IBM size
     manuals. I  spent over  a day  just going  over it,  and to me it
     seems rather  complete. I  primarily dabble  in  programming  and
     don't  consider  myself  a  professional  programmer  yet  so  my
     evaluation may  not be  perfect, I  also haven't  done that  much
     compiling. It did handle some programs from a UNIX system without
     any problems  (my old C compiler hated most of the stuff off UNIX
     systems) and  everything seems  to run  properly  so  I'm  fairly
     satisfied with  it. My  biggest complaint is Microsoft's function
     key templates.  I've got a 5151 keyboard and while they provide a
     nice template  for Codeview,  it only works with function keys on
     the left side of the keyboard, not on the top like mine.

          Please note  that  this  is  NOT  the  package  for  someone
     interested in  learning a  little about C or dabbling in it, this
     is meant  for someone  doing professional software development or
     at least  something close  to this.  For  someone  interested  in
     learning C, I'd say you're better off with something like Let's C
     or the  new Turbo  C from Borland. I haven't seen these packages,
     but both  have been  recommended by  others. I've also heard good
     things about  the DataLight C compiler, but unfortunately haven't
     Fidonews                     Page 13                   2 Mar 1987


     had a  chance to  see it  yet. DataLight's  current ad challenges
     Microsoft to  a speed test on compilation, linkage, and execution
     time. If  they lose,  they won't  advertise their  product for  2
     months. There's no reason for Microsoft to respond, but if anyone
     tests these  two compilers side by side drop me a line and let me
     know how they stack up against one another.

          Borland, incidentally,  has been  busy the  past few months,
     with the  release of  Eureka, TurboBASIC  and TurboC. From what I
     can tell  from the  ads, Eureka  is supposed  to be like MathCADD
     (also known  only from  ads), mainly  you enter equations the way
     you wrote  them in  various math classes and it can solve, graph,
     and do  other nice  things with  the equation.  TurboBASIC  is  a
     competitor to  Microsoft's QuickBASIC,  which was  a response  to
     TurboPascal. TurboC  is an  extension of  the idea and it will be
     interesting to  see how Microsoft responds to it. If they release
     a Quick  C, they  may be  cutting their  profits on their current
     compiler; yet  they  could  lose  more  sales  by  not  releasing
     anything, and  let Borland  take some  of their  C sales. I think
     they'll release  a Quick  C within the next few months which will
     be very  similar to  their current C compiler with a few changes.
     Mainly  no   Codeview,  smaller   libraries,   and   a   complete
     environment. As to how it will stack up,  let's wait and see what
     the reaction is to Turbo C.

          On the  lighter side, I've started playing Leather Goddesses
     of Phobos  from Infocom.  It's as  hilarious as  Hitchhiker's and
     possibly even  more bizzare!  If you  liked Hitchhiker's Guide to
     the Galaxy,  you will love Leather Goddesses. It's also the first
     adventure I've  seen  that  doesn't  assume  your  gender.  Their
     approach to asking you is unique. Very early in the game you must
     visit a  restroom, I  leave it to the reader to determine how , I
     leave it to the reader to figure out how the game determines your
     sex. There's  also three  levels of  play, varying from something
     you wouldn't  mind your  five year  old playing  to  lewd,  which
     supposedly uses most of George Carlin's seven words you can't say
     on television.

          The best  computer book  I've seen  in the past few weeks is
     "Supercharging MS-DOS"  by Van  Wolverton. It  is a  fairly  good
     introduction on  what  is  considered  advanced  topics  by  many
     people. It  does a very good job of teaching someone about things
     like ANSI.SYS,  printer control  codes, batch files. You are also
     guided through  redefining a key, and how to create your own menu
     system. The book is available from Microsoft Press for $18.95.

          Once again  I welcome  your own  comments on  anything  I've
     written about,  or something you think I should see (and possibly
     write about).  My US mail address is below along with my net/node
     number. If  you're a  user of  a BBS please mention to your sysop
     that mail  to me must be routed through either 157/0, 157/502, or
     157/1, he'll understand what that means. Sysop's take note of the
     previous sentence  if you send me mail yourself. Those nodes will
     also accept a file for me and are running SEAdog so you shouldn't
     have to worry about mail schedules.

     From the February 9,1987 issue of INFO WORLD.

                                  WARNING!

                    Trojan PC-Write Can Trash Your Disk


     A  system  operator  of  a Los Angeles bulletin board has found a
     bogus version of PC-Write.  The "trojan" version,  when  invoked,
     destroys  the fat of a user's hard disk and initiates a low-level
     format,  destroying the hard disk's  data,  according  to  system
     operator Tom Wilkinson.

     The  bad  version of the program masquerades as a "newer" release
     of Version 2.71 and is 98,274 bytes  long,  said  Wilkinson.  The
     real Version 2.7 is 98,242 bytes long,  and the real Version 2.71
     is 98,644 bytes.  The version posted on compuserve  is  the  real
     version, he said.  Quicksoft, PC-Write's developer, is offering a
     $2500  reward  for the first person who identifies the creator of
     the bogus program and a $5000 reward for the person who  provides
     proof  that convicts the perpetrator.  Those with information can
     contact Quicksoft at (206) 282-0452.
