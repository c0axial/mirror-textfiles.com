     Some more ZEC1 election stuff this week. The voting is on for another
     week, I believe.

     Don Bach says we should start planning another FidoCon. His note is
     below. Remember when FidoCon was just a bunch of FidoNet Sysops and
     not some corporate excuse for coach air travel?

     There's a guy looking for input about FidoNet for an article he's
     writing. The details follow twice. [grin]

     Region 13 has changed some of their web addresses.

     Got to go now. I smell my barbecue burning in the kitchen.

     Subj: Argus and TCP/IP Mailers

     Hello Christopher,

     I am referring to the letter by Damien Sam referencing the ARGUS IP
     mailer.  Argus is already widely in use in Zones 1, 2 and 3 since it
     can provide both IP and standard Fidonet functionality. On the
     traditional Fidonet side it can communicate with any Fidonet mailer
     such as InterMail and Bink.  On the Fidonet/ IP side it communicates
     using three options:

     1. other Argus mailers;
     2. mailers running under OS/2's VModem; and
     3. mailers using the new BinkD add-on module, which is available for a
        number of platforms such as several Unix-variants, OS/2, etc.

     While Argus may only be a Windows95/NT solution there are compatible
     solutions available for just about any platform which makes this
     viable for use in Fidonet.

     In Region 13 we have a number of IP nodes up and running using this
     technology.  I personally am running 1:2613/403 at kraut.dyn.ml.org on
     a part-time basis from 9:15GMT to 11:00GMT daily. David Calafrancesco,
     a current Z1EC candidate, is running 1:2624/306 at bbs.drakkar.org as
     a CM node on port 23. Another node is Dennis Murphy at 1:2630/316, who
     is running his node at IP address 130.68.  232.11  The number of nodes
     reachable via IP-Mailer is growing daily.

     The Zone 1 Regional Coordinators Council has discussed flags for IP
     Nodes and a decision on this matter is still pending.

     Best Regards,

     -=David=-

     Subject: Seeking FidoNet Comments

     Christopher,

     My name is David Noack and I'm a computer correspondent for Investor's
     Business Daily , a national business newspaper.

     I'm doing a story about what has long been forgotten or maybe even
     never considered by the general online public and that's FidoNet.
     While it came along after the Internet was developed-but before the
     Internet got much use by the general public even in those old Unix-
     dial-up account days, FidoNet came along in the mid-1980s.

     In a way FidoNet parallels the problems faced by the Internet and the
     World Wide Web, which obviously has a greater marketing campaign and
     pretty cheap access for what you can do online.

     Anyway, I would like to get some comments from FidoNet users, Zone,
     Net and Hub coordinators, in addition to folks who simply use FidoNet
     because they like it.

     Here are some questions for your consideration and feel to add any
     other comments regarding the story.

     How long have you been using FidoNet. What do you use FidoNet for. How
     many different ways can someone use FidoNet. To send mail, which is
     Netmail; discussion groups, which are called Echo Mail, and I would
     guess file transfer. Are there any commercial uses to Fidonet by a
     business, maybe even a home-based or small business or has everything
     migrated to the Internet.

     What are some of the advantages/disadvantages in using FidoNet?

     How does it differ and where is it similar to the Internet?

     Is FidoNet considered network/BBS system for real computer hobbyists
     and enthusiasts? Does anyone connect to dial-up local BBSes anymore?
     Has FidoNet and BBSes fallen on hard times thanks to the Internet or
     is that perception wrong. Has there been any growth in the number of
     FidoNet users.

     Can you provide some examples of how you use FidoNet? What do you do.
     Do you use it for work or just at home?

     Are there any estimates as to how many people use FidoNet? Or maybe to
     be more accurate, how many nodes there are around the world and from
     that figure you can assume that there maybe hundreds of people who
     connect to that particular bulletin board.

     FIDONEWS 15-06               Page 5                    9 Feb 1998


     Why is FidoNet not that well-known? It is conscious effort to keep it
     in the realm of computer hobbyists so it does not become too cluttered
     as the Internet has become?

     Since FidoNet was originally tied to BBS's, how has FidoNet adopted to
     take advantage of the Internet?

     If you can, please provide as many examples of how FidoNet gets used
     and if you think I should ask someone else questions, can you kindly
     include their name and e-mail address.

     I look forward to hearing from you.

     Hi Christopher,

     Region 13 Home Page is down... a new site is planned. On the bright
     site, Net 2613's site, maintained by NC2613 John Rooker is up with
     sound and pictures at www.ggw.org/net2613.  Verifications:
     jrooker@wnybbs.net

     I also have posted the nodelist maintenance utility NLTOOLS by David
     Nugent on my web site for download: home.eznet.net/~david/download.htm
     NLTOOLS is intended as a replacement for MakeNL, source code
     available, and is year 2000 compatible.

     Subj: Correction

     Hello Christopher,

     For historical correctness, this is a correction to a statement Bob
     Kohl made with regard to past REC13s:

     Jim Balcom, the current REC13, was preceded by David Calafrancesco.
     David's predecessor was Jerry Seward, not Rick Ashworth.

     Best Regards,

     - David Moufarrege, RC13

      * Originally dated 2 Feb 1998, 20:42

      For those of you who may not know me, my name is Lisa Smoot and I am
     Jim Smoot's youngest daughter. As many of you may already be aware, my
     Dad has a terminal illness and in the last few weeks his health has
     not been doing very well at all. For those interested, my Dad is up
     and about for very short periods of time but medical conditions demand
     low stress and lots of rest.

      None the less, my Dad has always enjoyed his hobby and has asked that
     I post this message: "If we can get beyond the _personality_ issues
     and conflict and put our hobby into perspective, then it becomes much
     easier to see and support the best of the available candidates for
     ZEC.  In my opinion, Bob Kohl is the right man for the task. Your
     support would also be appreciated."

      Thanks Bunches,

     I've been contacted by a reporter/editor of a magazine with regards to
     FidoNet.  This person is not known to me personally, but I've
     researched and verified that this person is indeed legitimate.  Others
     may also have been contacted, so I may be just posting this out for no
     good reason.

     The reason I'm contacting you via 'blind cc' is to get your permission
     to send your E-mail address to this reporter for an 'on-line'
     interview.  The publication that this is for made me sit up and pay
     close attention to this message, and make certain that it was a
     legitimate request before I sent this out to you.  It's not the WALL
     STREET JOURNAL, TIME or NEWSWEEK, but it's about as good as any of
     those.

     As well, if you have the E-mail address of someone that you feel may
     be able to speak to these issues better, or should be included in any
     list, please forward the address to me, and I will contact them as
     well.

     This is the extract of the message, containing the questions that I
     know will be asked...there may be others which come out of your
     responses, no doubt::

     The reason I'm interested in helping this reporter is that the
     reporter is grounded in computers and electronic communication. .
     . pretty much, no bluffing or posturing is going to get past without
     being noticed.

     The message came to me Friday, and I'm informed that the reporter
     would like to have responses by next week (this coming Friday, at the
     latest).

     I'm fighting a combination of the "Killer Flu" and strep throat, and
     for some reason, my eyes are clogging up as well, so I wasn't able to
     respond to the reporter other than to "give me a day or two to be able
     to see"....and to give me time to contact you as well as formulate a
     response.

     Go for it.  Let me know ASAP so I can send the E-Mail addresses out,
     as well as contact those whose addresses you might send me.  I can't
     guarantee the reporter will contact all of those I send, but we'll try
     and get a good mention, nonetheless.

     Thanks, and hope to hear from you all.

     and some old ones for the old-timers

     In the IBM 360 days, there were a lot of instruction opcode
     acronyms going around.  There were ones like:

             HCF     Halt and Catch Fire

             JCT     Jump Conditional Tuesday

             and my very favorite:

             RDI     Reverse Drum Immediate
