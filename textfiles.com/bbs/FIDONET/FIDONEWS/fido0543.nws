                                 ELVIS
                  A Generic Echomail Statistics Utility

     ELVIS was designed to maintain a history of Echomail traffic for
     your system.  It reports counts of incoming messages, in each
     echo area, and from each network node sending to you.  Since
     Elvis derives its data directly from incoming packets, and
     requires no system-specific control files other than its own,
     it's compatible with just about any MS-DOS system that receives
     FidoNet-compatible echomail.  It is useful for identifying dead
     echos, broken links, and dupe sources, especially for echomail
     hubs handling a large number of echo areas or nodes.

     Elvis consists of two executable files; ELVIS.EXE, which scans
     incoming mail and stores message counts in monthly data files.
     ELVISRPT.EXE is used to generate ASCII reports from the data
     files written by ELVIS.EXE.  Any date range (that you have data
     for) may be specified.  Command line switches may be used to
     report only the message counts in certain echo areas or from
     certain nodes.

     File Request ELVIS100.ARC from FidoNet 170/200.  Size is 39K,
     about 3 minutes at 2400 baud.

     SysOp of East Bay X-Change TCommNet BBS
     372/555, 372/666, 372/777 and 372/888


         I am pleased to announce that I have received permission to
     create a HAYES technical support conference for owners of Hayes
     Microcomputer Products modems.

         I will host this new EchoMail area (tag is "HAYES") and the
     folks at Hayes technical support department will check in daily
     to answer any new questions.

         The following is the unedited text of a letter I received
     electronically from John Aitken, the head of Hayes SysOp support
     in Atlanta:



                         Hayes Microcomputer Products, Inc
                                 705 Westech Drive
                                 Norcross,GA.30092


     TO:        Mike Ratledge, Sysop - East Bay X-Change BBS
     FROM:      John Aitken, Hayes - Sysop Support Coordinator
     SUBJECT:   Hayes Technical Support Forum
     Date:      16 September, 1988



     Mike, We at Hayes are actively committed to supporting our
     Customers, and are always seeking new ways to provide that
     support.  Towards that end I accept your invitation to
     participate in your Hayes Support Message Area within the Fido
     - Networking System.

     Once your Message Area is up and running we will actively
     participate by signing-on daily, answering questions and
     providing technical support to all callers within the network.

     Additionally, I have provided you with full access to the Hayes
     Sysop Support Conference, where you will have access to all
     technical files, bulletins, and configuration notes - contained
     within our Technical Library.

     Please feel free to utilize any of the technical information
     that you may find within our file directories and be sure to let
     me know how we can provide additional help or information.

     FidoNet callers are invited to submit their questions,
     suggestions, and comments - within the message area, and we will
     monitor and reply on a daily basis.

     If there is anything that we can do for you or your FidoNet
     callers - please don't hesitate to ask.

     Best regards and good wishes for your Network!

             John Aitken
             Hayes Sysop Support Coordinator
             Training and Customer Services



     If you would like to recieve this echomail area on your system,
     please get in touch with me at 372/888 and we'll setup your link
     according to the volume of requests I receive.  I imagine that
     this echo area will warrant being carried on the "backbone" in a
     short time!  NOTE: 372/555 is a Hayes V96 unit - it's online at
     5:30PM each weekday (until 8AM) and all weekend, too.  If you
     wish to sign on locally, you should call 372/666 or 372/888 and
     register.  Be sure to ask for access to the V96 unit.  I will
     have a second V9600 online by the time this article is printed.

                      Yet Another Complicated Komment

                            by Steven K. Hoskin
                        ( STEVE HOSKIN at 1:128/31 )

                       Episode 13:  The Negative Side


     "IF THIS REALLY WAS A GOOD HOBBY NETWORK YOU'D TALK ABOUT D&D".

     This was a message to me  from  a  user  about my board.  I don't
     happen to have any  message  areas  that  cover  D&D.  Funny that
     should be the  case,  since  my  advertised  specialty  areas are
     EagleTech Software and the national AVIATION EchoMail conference.

     I politely responded,  explaining  that  "Amateur  Hobby Network"
     means that  *I*  have  a  hobby  in  playing  with  computers and
     networking them together.  It  does not necessarily follow that I
     support all hobbies.  Even though  I happen to like D&D and other
     adventure, role-playing and war games.

     Then I get this guy who  calls  in  with  a name whose validity I
     question.  So I left him a  message  AND a custom welcome, asking
     him to verify the name,  with  address  and  phone number.  Seven
     times he logged in, saw the custom  welcome, and hit all the file
     areas and logged off.  I dropped  him  to DISGRACE status, left a
     more clearly worded custom welcome; still he called in about four
     more times, tried to hit the file  areas (the only one allowed at
     DISGRACE level  is  the  FidoNews  Area),  and  logged off.  So I
     TWITted him.  Why didn't he just leave me a message?  I even told
     him how to do it on the custom welcome.

     And the classic  -  "Hacker  calling".    Oh,  that's  TWIT level
     immediately.

     Why is it so hard for people to  say who they really are on BBSs?
     I don't recall ever  having  that  difficulty when *I* was a mere
     user.  And if  ever  there  was  a  strange  person, I definitely
     qualify.  But *I*  never  had  any  problems  using my real name.
     Handles are kind of nice, when  they  apply, but this doesn't cut
     well in EchoMail.  Too many people out there.

     Oh, well,  even  FidoNet  can't  be  all  blessings  and charm, I
     suppose.  I've been blessed,  even  in my troubles with users, in
     that I haven't had any vicious  hackers  trying to crash my board
     or slam my communication links.    I've heard of such, but (knock
     on wood) haven't seen any.

     I guess I'll just overlook the negative side and enjoy my hobby.
