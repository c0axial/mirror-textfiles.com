   I apparently got the node address  of  Mr  CIA  wrong  last
week.  The article had been sent via a bombing run to some 15 or
twenty people, and contained the entire article written  by  Mr.
Juda  as a quotation at the begining.  I editid out the 20 or 30
kludge lines, etc., that resulted, and seem to have  gotten  the
wrong node number on the article.

   For that, I apologize.  For calling Mr. CIA a paranoid
idiot in this week's issue, I will not.  Perhaps the readers of
this can read his note, and decide on that themselves.  I cannot
be bothered.

Greetings Editor!
From: C I A (1:2623/71)

   You needn't feel embarrassed on my behalf. I just wanted to point
   out, however, that I don't even have an echomail feed, so I don't
   know how I would be well-known. My apologies if the word "anal" was
   taken as foul-mouthed. Also, I think you may be mistaken about Mr.
   Juda paying for his gateway on his own nickle, his message said the
   IEEE had paid for the resources and bandwidth (hence my comment
   about leeching)..  The purpose of my letter was to express my
   disgust at the way the gateway was run - twit filtering, improper
   bouncing, etc.. I did not ask for a chance to run my own gate - I
   stated that I could, very simply and cheaply, do so, and intend to
   do so, but not with FTS gating programs.

   Mr. Juda wanted to go out the door making us all feel guilty that a
   few people were abusing his service - it wasn't me, I used the
   gateway perhaps three times, and found it unreliable, and didn't
   continue trying.  My message offered a few reasons not to feel
   guilty about Burt quitting, that we're not loosing a gatekeeper,
   we're gaining an open door :)

   (BTW, my real name is in the nodelist, if you would like to look up
   my node, CIA are my initials ;p  )

Greetings Editor!
From: C I A (1:2623/71)

  Sir, I have just noticed an error in the letter you published from
  me.
 ** The Free Ride is Over! ***
BY C.I.A. CASINO NETWORK (1:2623/58)
[snip]

   Why does it say Casino Network (1:2623/58) when I sent it to you
   crash from my own node, which was in the origin or kludge line? (I
   wonder, Is that a subtle attempt to frame me of forgery, for later
   reprisals, for sending my msg about Mr. Juda?? Yes, I'm paranoid ;p )

          ---------------------------------------------
EDITOR'S NOTE: It arrived with 4 pages of quotations at the
               beginning.  Those contained several different
               addresses of various systems, and it was unclear
               where it came from.  I cleaned it up (apparently
               erroneously) before printing it.  If that gives rise
               to rampant paranoia, I apologize.

FidoNet.... Commentary
by Fran Clodomar  1:278/109

No Place Like . . .

My name is Fran and I'm a sysop of oh, say, uh, 9 years.  I have been
a user when I got my first computer, which was (blush, shudder) Tandy 1K
TX.  That was also my first bbs computer.  Along the way, I met some
really wonderful folks and some not so wonderful folks.  I also met
users face to face as well as online.  At the time I begun, I was living
in Texas, in a small city and started modeming.  I still have fond
memories of Net 386.  (Hi guys, hope you're reading this little drivel).
You know, the image you have in mind sometimes doesn't jab with reality.
(I'd confess, I had this image of a God-like persona when I finally met
the sysop of one of the bbs that I had frequented.)  It was a relief and
a let-down.  A relief because the sysop was a normal person like myself
and a let-down because of the image that I had so carefully crafted from
a few cyber-chat that I had with him was blown to smithereens.

Now why am I writing this??  First, I've got nothing better to do than
to sit at my computer all day and wait for the echoes to come in. I know
what you are thinking, "Yeah, right ", a sly grin on your faces.  Okay
so that didn't work.  Okay.  How about this one, "I've been meaning to
write to Fidonews for a long time now and this is a good a chance as
any."  No??? Humph!  You are a tough audience, you know.  The jokes are
deader than a ..... Can't say that word.  This is a family type audience.
Young folks might be reading this and get the wrong impression.  I know
I just did,  reading the last issue  (13-05).  What a horrible way to
end the tome.  Insult flying, crude manners showing, and a no-gut way
of bragging.  NO-GUT??!!?? you say.  Yes, no guts.  The writer didn't
FidoNews 13-06                 Page:  4                    05 Feb 1996

bother to use his real name on the article.  Instead he/she used an
alias of C.I.A.  Kind of make you wonder if perhaps he/she
(got to be PC here) was the terrorist behind the successful
bombing of the Fidonet/Internet Gateway.  Let's give this person
a round of applause, shall we? [applause sign light up] It is this kind
of mentality that causes others to question their sanity about doing
FUN things that helps connect and bring people together.
It's this kind of mental attitude that causes echoes to dry up.
And it is this kind of attitude that causes net to stagnant and died.

DIED??!!?? You asked incrediously. Yes died.  At least the Fidonet
that I once knew is dying.  I never did get the chance to meet Tom
Jennings or any of the founding members but I did get a
chance to meet the wonderful folks who followed after them.  We must
not let a few mean-spirited individuals try to spoil the camaderie and
spirit that was once Fidonet.  Fidonet set the trends for other nets.
It is the standard by which othernets judged themselves.  There is not
a day that goes by when this net isn't mention whether in a derogatory
manner or in a neutral tone.  I don't have the answers on how to make
this net better.  But I do have some thought on how to treat people.
Just because it's a few pixels that lights up the phosphor dots on a
cathode ray tube, it doesn't mean we can hide behind it and act boorish.
It doesn't mean that we can take our intelligence down 100 point below
and act like complete jerks or idiots.  Come on, now.  The words were
written by a human being, flesh and blood, with intelligence, wits,
sensitivity, and heart.  I've read some of the posting in some of the
echoes and some of them are so down right cruel and crude even from
the moderators themselves. Shouldn't such one be a model for the users
in the echoes?

You may not care, but I do.  And I aim to stick with Fidonet til the
bitter end.

Thank you for your attention to my long-winded drivel.

CaveNet -- for Cave-Related Conferences

by Bruce Bowman 1:231/710
CaveNet Echoes Available

I'm not going to waste a lot of hard drive space here -- if you are
interested in some cave-related echoes, consider connecting with the
CaveNet conferences.

CaveNet is gated into Fido by me (Bruce Bowman) at 1:231/710. There
is no distribution system, nor is it on the backbone. Until traffic
increases, you will have to poll me for mail. Several of the echoes
are gated to Internet mailing lists, as indicated by the * below.
If interested, send me netmail giving me a session password and what
echoes you want to carry. There are currently no file echoes.

-----
1) I do NOT have areafix or an equivalent set up, so if you send me
a message of this nature it will be ignored. I can do a rescan
for you if you ask me to.
2) I currently make a mail run every Saturday, so it would be best
to poll me on Sunday -- your mail will be waiting on hold for you.
3) Please poll at least once a week.
4) Do not hub the mail to others without prior approval.
5) Don't be a jerk -- flamefests are mercilessly stifled.

If traffic increases, so will the frequency of mail exchanges, and
we might even get on the backbone. See the latest echolist in the
CN_* section for more information. That is all...

Gateways, Fido and Life

by Bruce Bowman 1:231/710
Time to Talk of Many Things...

Re: Internet Killed the Fidonet Star

Ronald, you hit the target. The only reason people call here anymore
is because I offer free email access so friends can leave each other
messages -- or to play a door or hog a file. Even now, I have a
caller online who didn't even read my system news and instead made a
beeline for Trade Wars.

But I think you may have overlooked other reasons for why FidoNet
may be crumbling. I believe that Planet Connect was the beginning of
the end for FidoNet. Before PC, we had an interwoven *C and *EC
structure that HAD TO cooperate to survive. Suddenly, every net was
an island, and my own was no exception. NECs just downloaded off the
bird, and the NCs started refusing to perform what I consider to be
a duty of the position -- routing netmail. Many wouldn't even pick
up FidoNews, and now there are times when even nodediffs lie musty
and forgotten.

The link was broken.

FidoNet was once a community that stretched across the planet,
dedicated to INFORMATION EXCHANGE, and populated by sysops who
were primarily a bunch of techies. But with the advent of the
"BBS-in-a-box," everyone could become a sysop. We grew beyond
sustainability, and the camaraderie was suddenly gone. Sharing
of information turned to flamefests. Internet or no internet, I
believe we need to place the blame for the downfall of FidoNet
squarely on ourselves.

How to fix it? I have no idea, but I will tell you this...I put a
Linux partition on my hard drive last night.

As usual, someone has performed a thankless job for years,
performed it well, and had to get out of the business because a
few people refused to follow some simple rules. Even worse, we
have a [name deleted after thinking better of it] trying to kick
him when he's down.

Mr. Juda, thank you for putting up with us for all these years.
I have never corresponded with you, but I appreciate what you
have done. Be assured that the majority of us feel the same way,
and will not lower ourselves to crying like a child just because
we can no longer conveniently suckle at the tit of your
generosity.

Free Listings in the Telecommunications Directory

Free Listings in the Telecommunications Directory

A Detroit publishing company, Gale Research Inc., is preparing
a new edition of its {Telecommunications Directory}, which it
describes as "an international descriptive guide to telecommunications
companies, services, systems, and related organizations in the field."

If you provide telecommunications services (data communications,
cellular, teleconferencing, electronic mail, etc.) or provide
telecommunications-related serices such as telecommunications-
oriented consulting or legal services, you may want to get your
company listed in the directory. There is no charge to be listed.
Internet service providers are especially encouraged to get
themselves listed. Associations and labor unions in the
telecommunications field are also eligible to be listed.

I will be glad to send a questionnaire for the directory to anyone
who requests one, or you can obtain one by going to the Web page

This article is aimed directly at the "so-called" mr cia....(notice
the small letters there small man)

You rant and rave about Bert Juda shutting down the internet gateway
and say it is about time he "got out of the way"... This brings to
mind 2 points right off the bat.

POINT 1:  Bert was never "in the way" to begin with. He provided (at
FidoNews 13-06                 Page: 11                    05 Feb 1996

his own expense) a service used by many in fidonet. This makes him an
order of magnatude better then you could ever hope to be. You're not
even man enough to use your real name....but then again I keep
forgeting the fact that you are a "little man"

POINT2:  The fact that Bert had a gate up and running in no way stopped
you from doing the same. There were/are gates all over fidonet into the
internet. If you are so "good" at running a gate maybe you should have
already set yours up.

In reality, you are probably a 12 year old "cereal-box-sysop" with a lot
of free time on your hands, a big mouth, small brain, and  an inferiority
complex that is so big you have to use four letter words to feel wanted.

I think Bert Juda (and I "have" met the man) and a lot of other sysops in
this net would be just delighted to see you set up your "gate". I can bet
you won't and it won't be because you can't get an ISP that is not anal
retentive (like yourself), but because you lack the know-how, funds and
your parents permission....

Think this one question over long and hard kid.......

If you set up your "gateway", are you capable of defending yourself
against all the lawsuits, gate crashers, assorted low lifes (like
yourself) and general abusers. I doubt it. I tend to believe that
your parents (you remember them....the folks that pay your bills)
would snatch the plug on you so fast your brain wouldn't stop
spinning for at least a month.

Tell ya what......set up your gate....I'll be more then happy to bring
your petty ego crashing down (along with your hardware) around your ears.
Then, after you have had a taste of your own medicine, I'll give you time
to lick your wounds (along with your balls) and when you come back for more
.......you'll get it!
