     Greetings,

     Well, it's been a week for all sort of problems and my heart goes out
     to those who lost a love one in Turkey.  That was a bad one last
     Tuesday.

     Hope you guys will make it on the border between Mexico and the USA,
     as that tornado does not sound so good.  Nevermind what is happening
     in Hong Kong.

     Boy-o-boy, it certainly has been one week of disasters.  And it looks
     like FidoNet is not being singled out neither.  See whats below in
     store for R28 in Zone 2.  Well whatever, good luck.

     Enjoy,

     PS.  Only received one application for the editorship. ;-(

     Structure change for Region 28
     by Jan Vermeulen, 2:28/0

     During these last days, the nodes of Region 28 have been receiving
     notice from their RC informing them that their node number is due
     to change amd that the region's current 10 networks containing
     40 hubs and 355 sysops will be reduced to one single network.

     The process will take some 24 months, and utter care is being taken
     that no sysop will be compelled to leave FidoNet for reasons of a
     clerical nature.

     Region 28 has a history of geographically overlapping nets based on
     different echomail distribution structures and personal dislikes
     between coordinators.

     As of May last, existing echomail distribution systems follow the
     same rules and conditions so there is no reason any more for a
     distinction between nets on that basis. And personal dislikes
     between coordinators are no reason at all to have separate nets.

     The structure change that happened in 1993 in R24 has shown about all
     flaws that can make such an operation a sheer disaster: instant loss
     of the old node number, issue of new node numbers to sysops on holy-
     day, coordinators imposing their own views even contradictory to the
     purpose of the operation, and squaring old accounts with disliked
     fellow coordinators.

     That is why the operation needs to take a long time in order to
     ensure a secrey and easy transition: existing node numbers will
     remain in use as long a needed.

     With the exception of one net, all network lists will be frozen, i.e.
     that no new nodes can be added to those lists and no node number
     changes will be possible.

     Current NCs can remain in office as keepers of their frozen network
     list, and take care of their correctness, if they wish to do so.

     Nodes may link to any hub of their choice; hubs will take care of
     echomail and netmail for the nodes linked to them. Net numbers of
     noides and hubs may differ, but in such cases both the node and the
     hub will be allocated akas in the 'non-frozen' network.

     Hub nodes will be under the obligation to accept new nodes as well as
     the corresponding node number in the 'non-frozen' network.

     New nodes, if any, can only get a node number in the 'non-frozen'
     network.

     All nodes will be advised to change into the 'non-frozen' network as
     FIDONEWS 16-34               Page 3                   23 Aug 1999


     soon as they can without problems (points, echomail akas). Ideally,
     the operation should be completed in two years' time.

     Once the transition has completed, there will be elections for the RC
     and NC positions.

     The plan has been reviewed by the ZC/2, who has also been requested
     to allocate the 'non-frozen' network's number and select the NC of
     that net. His decision follows:

     Re: R28
     ------------------------------------------------------------------
     Hello Jan,

     I have reviewed your long-term development-plan for R28 and hereby
     approve it.

     It seems logical to me at this moment to designate 280 as the unique
     net for the future, and not something new, because it is an already
     operating net so there is continuity.

     It seems logical in order to oversee the future development of R28
     that you fill the NC280 seat yourself, or your possible successor
     should you vacate the RC28-office, until such a time when the
     operation has been completed.

     At that time an NC-election as per NC_ELECT would be called for I
     think.

     Have a nice day,

       \x/ard Dossche
            ZC/2

     HOT ECHO RIGHT NOW!

     Hey folks, I recently was asked to take over an echo that was
     floundering who had lost its moderator and the substitute moderator
     just didn't have the time to devote to the echo.  I would like to
     repost the message I got to post in there tonight just 12 days after
     I took over the echo.

     Just note the echo started with 5 messages for the 1st week of August
     and we raised it to 22 for the 1st week I took over but this past 3
     days we have had as many as 62 messages in one day (YESTERDAY)  And
     the lowest was 32 for Tuesday.  I don't have Sunday and Mondays stats
     but the weekly stats will be posted on Sunday for all to see. :)

     So if you're interested in an echo that has that down home feeling
     where you can grab a cup of coffee and just sit around chatting about
     the weather or read a few jokes or stories then join us TODAY!!!

     Okay I have kept up with the stats since the week I took over this
     echo.  Here they are and I especially want you to notice the past 3
     days. :)

     I took over on 8/07 so only 1 days worth was in this first week.

     I don't believe it!  Thursday and we had 62 messages! :)  I doubt if
     we can top that Friday and Saturday but I can't wait to see the 2nd
     week total.  Here is 146 in just the past 3 days. :)  Keep up the
     good work and I'll keep trying to keep things jumping and adding in
     all sorts of jokes and stories I find.
