     William J.Bradley. (1:163/223)

                           THE WORLD WE LIVE IN
                           --------------------

     A couple of nights ago as I drove up to the farmhouse
     in that I share with my wife and five sons, I was struck by the
     beauty of the sunset that was in progress at the time. It remind-
     ed me of when I was a boy delivering the morning newspaper when
     many mornings began with such a beautiful sunrise that I often
     wished that it would never end.

     We live in such a beautiful world and in the intervening
     45 years since my boyhood sunrises and my more recent sunsets,
     we have managed to do terrible things to this lovely gift of
     creation. All of us who live in N.America have had a part in the
     problems that have developed. For example, most of us own, use
     or drive vehicles that don't run on hay and you can't eat when
     you are finished with them. Most of us also, in this part of the
     world, wear synthetic clothing that burns with the ferocity of
     petrochemicals and with the same smell and polluting ability.
     (We had to find all-cotton Tee shirts for one of our sons who
     was in a body brace. Such Tee shirts were almost impossible to
     find. A friend visiting overseas finally brought some home for
     us!) Finally, as I sit here writing this article on my PC, some-
     thing is burning or radiating somewhere, to give me the power
     to use this computer. As the power is produced, so is waste that
     someone, somewhere has to figure out how to get rid of.

     Most of my life has been spent in a health technology of
     one sort or another. About two years ago I left that work to go
     into analytical laboratory work. I am now a project coordinator
     for an organic and inorganic analytical laboratory that spends
     a lot of its time doing environmental analyses for government and
     industry. It has been through this work that the idea for
     this project developed.

     Some of the pictures that come to mind when I think of
     the word "environment" and "environmentalist" are ones of either
     confrontation or of 'doom and gloom'. The confrontation is often
     with large organizations and the 'doom-and-gloomers' are often
     scientists. Yet when you look at the daily press a little more
     closely you often find quite a lot of people struggling with day
     to day environmental problems and often finding useful solutions.

     For example I live in a small rural community and haul
     my trash to a small local dumpsite. About two years ago the
     Ministry of the Environment stopped municipalities from burning
     off the refuse in their dumpsites. That was fair enough as
     burning only moves the dump to another site via the air that we
     need to breathe and live. However the consequence has been that
     the dump filled with astonishing rapidity and will close in
     another two months. In its place there will be a door to door
     pick up, throughout the county, by a contractor. Whoever wins
     the contract will have to prove by sub-contracts, that he has
     a recycling destination for most of the refuse. The householders
     FidoNews 7-21                Page 3                   21 May 1990


     will then be expected to sort all of their trash into various
     categories such as glass, tin, paper and plastics etc..

     Then there were the two families that were featured on
     a TV program who hardly have need of garbage pick-up at all. The
     last time one lady used the garbage service was six weeks before
     the filming of the TV program. The other lady could not remember
     when she had used the garbage collection service. Both of these
     women had organized their households in such a way that every-
     thing was re-used and composted.

     Some people will not use disposable diapers. A hundred
     years from now an Archeologist specializing in our dumpsites
     will be digging up the outer wrappings of Junior's diaper. In
     the same way you read of people who will not use styrofoam cups
     or patronize take-out food businesses that package their food
     in styrofoam containers.

     All of this sparked my interest and I began clipp-
     ing environmental articles out of the newspapers. Then I categ-
     orized them, paraphrased them, (Wrote a short description of the
     article.) put them on a database and sorted them. The result of
     this effort was fascinating reading. When I described this exper-
     ience to friends and clients alike, they expressed an interest
     in seeing something like what I had done, put out on a regular
     basis.

     Having given it a lot of thought, what I would like to
     do is establish a database of clipped newpaper articles, on the
     environment, from as wide an area as possible. This desire then,
     leads me to all of you who participate in the worldwide FIDO
     network. What I would like to ask of you is this:

        1. Would you be interested in clipping articles
           from your local newspaper and sending them
           to me. When you clip them I will need:

               a. Name of the newspaper
               b. Page number
               c. Date of publication

        2. Having clipped the article, would you be inter-
           ested in helping out further by writing a 4 to
           5 line paraphrase (description) of the article.

     (AS I UNDERSTAND IT, AND CORRECT ME IF I AM WRONG PLEASE, I AM
     ALLOWED TO PUBLISH THE DESCRIPTION OF AN ARTICLE (A PARAPHRASE),
     AS LONG AS I SUPPLY DETAILS OF THE SOURCE.)

     Once the database was established I would do a number
     of things with it:

     FidoNews 7-21                Page 4                   21 May 1990


       A. The database in its entirety would be offered for use
          to all who participate in the FIDO network.

       B. Establish a non-profit organization to offer the use of
          the database to private individuals, industry and govern-
          ment, anywhere in the world who may wish to use it. The
          indications I have at the moment are that such database
          would be welcomed. In this latter instance a fee would be
          charged. This project will consume a lot of time and will
          require people to work at it full time, so it will need to
          earn enough to pay its own way.

          At the present time there is a start-up committee of two
          Ph.D. level scientists. A Ph.D. level university professor
          who teaches economic ethics, a businessman who manufactures
          laboratory products and myself.

     Following are the categories that I have used so far,
     any further suggestions would be appreciated. After the categ-
     ories you will see a few examples of paraphrased clippings.

     We are all, each and every one of us, contributors to
     the environment that we live, therefore we all have a respons-
     ibility - each in his or her own way - to contribute what we can
     to improve the health of that environment and in this way, the
     health of us all.  So get out the scissors.......! You can reach

                What is the Christian Distribution Network?


     Through a pleasant association with the SDN Project, Ray Waldo
     came up with the idea for the Christian Distribution Network
     (CDN) Project (sm).  Although the SDN Project made available a
     vast array of excellent shareware files, the Project didn't
     specifically address the special interests of those who use their
     computers for Church-related or Christian-related endeavors.  It
     is Ray's intent to bridge that gap with the CDN Project.

     Ray Waldo is CDN's founder and Project Manager.  Over the last
     several months, he has been busy creating the CDN Project and
     fine-tuning the details.  His enthusiasm for the project has
     pushed it to grow and develop, with new systems joining each
     week.

     The CDN is made up of BBS operators, software developers, and end
     users.  Any of these may be clergy, laity or Church staff.  CDN
     uses TICK or FLEA to automatically distribute acceptable software
     and text files that have been developed to support Christian
     computing.  The idea is to make available files that can be of
     help to the Christian SysOp or computer user.

     Distribution is carried out in file echos, which are basically
     the same as message echos, except that files and not messages are
     exchanged.  CDN currently has several file echos available.  The
     first is CDN, which is for general Christian and Church software.
     CDN_TEXT is to distribute Christian text; CDN_TROL is CDN's
     distribution of 'THE ROCK' On-Line files, dealing with
     Contemporary Christian Music.  Currently under development are
     CDN_CFC to distribute Computers for Christ's text files; CDN_MJCN
     for the Messianic Jewish Computer Network; and CDN_MIDI to
     distribute Christian-Related MIDI files.

     CDN has two message echos as well.  CDN_SYSOP is for SysOps in
     the CDN project.  CDN_FILES is the echo for anyone interested in
     CDN and the files it distributes.  This echo is the primary means
     of notification to the general public of all files distributed.

     From time to time, CDN makes certain large files available
     through postal distribution.  For example, recently the Online
     Bible (13 360K diskettes) was considered too large to distribute
     by modem, so it was made available to those interested through
     postal distribution.  The package went to the first SysOp on the
     list, who sent it to the next, and so on until it was returned to
     Ray.

     There are several types of CDN members.  Full members carry the
     UCDN flag in the FidoNet or NetWork nodelists.  Full members must
     carry all program file areas, maintain files for a specified
     length of time, and not change the compression type or remove the
     Security Envelope for at least three weeks.  Limited members do
     not carry the UCDN flag.  They are not required to carry all
     program file areas, and may make any legal changes in the
     compression technique, remove the security envelope or delete the
     files from their systems after all pending transfers have taken
     place.  Finally, a recipient is considered a "user" of the CDN
     net distributor, and have no restrictions placed on them.

     Those interested in joining the CDN project in any capacity
     should look for their local CDN node (search the nodelist for the
     UCDN flag) and request the file CDN_JOIN.EXE.  That file contains
     the current policy document, as well as information on joining
     the project.  CDN_JOIN.EXE is also avaialble from 1:115/790 (aka
     8:7003/2007) or from Ray's system, 1:394/1 (aka 8:7003/1); both
     are 9600 HST systems.

     File Echos & Support Group NetWorks
     (the Best thing to happen to networking since Mail)


      Many times within the constraints of already existing Networks
      (i.e. FidoNet, RBBSNet, BBSNet, GhotiNet, etc) develops a
      Support Group, Informational Network, Distribution System or
      unique Topical File Echos. Right now file echos are spreading
      like wildfire. Much in the same manner that echos originated,
      file echos are headed. In fact, now the latest FidoNews and
      Nodediff comes echoed via Tick in two distinct file echos
      NODEDIFF and FNEWS to most local networks.


      With file echos, files can go directly online (to the area of
      recieving sysops choice) with a description. File echos use a
      secure environment and have a dupe catcher so, no worries mate.
      In the old days, as sysops, we could send each other File
      Attatches and the receiving sysop would have to move the file
      online and type a description into the display file for users.
      Now, with new technology we can send files not only to each
      other but the description comes with it and it can be
      immediately avaliable for the our users, and friends too.

      The utility that changed my life was Tick, written by Barry
      Geller. The latest avaliable version is 2.00 usually found as
      Tick200.Lzh. Seems right after that, the next great invention
      came out; Raid, by George Peace, which is an Areafix for Tick
      and can be used to turn file echos on and off. Current Raid
      release version is 1.00 found mostly as Raid100.Lzh. There is
      to be a new Raid with an "Announce" function built in and
      it will "AutoCreate" new File echo areas. I am willing to bet
      Release Two will be out shortly. Ticket, by Paul West, is one
      of many file announcement programs. Also avaliable is RFP
      (Recieved for Processing), by Tom Hendricks is another Great
      and completely configurable File Announcement Program. Yes,
      Its getting better all the time <Lennon and McCartney>.

      I can't say what was the first file echo. But shucks, I was just
      mesmerized by the SDS. When our Local NEC who at the time was
      Bill Anderson started distributing the SDS to us it was it was
      like discovering ice cream for the first time <grin>. A
      chocolate soda fountain had been turned on we had only dreamed
      existed. Before this, we all shared new releases that someone
      was lucky enough to File Request. When someone got a new some-
      thing or other that helped the operation of their BBS, they
      would announce it in the local sysop echo and we would out and
      wazoo it, FReq it, or any other manner at our disposal. Since
      the SDS came to town they all would mysteriously just show up.

      The concept of file echos caught on so strong here in our local
     FidoNews 7-21                Page 12                  21 May 1990


      community that a group of about 7 of us formed over 75 local
      file echos which we use to share new shareware programs and
      uploads via our local network(s). One I originally contacted
      Barry Geller about some problems I was having with a "C" Echo,
      I renamed to CEE and is now distributed in 3 regions in Fido-
      Net. And since then too, I began help with beta testing Tick and
      finally Raid at Barry and Georges invitation and my persistance
      <grin>.

      That was about two years ago and other things have changed here
      and now Ed Cavender and I pick up the SDS & DDSDOORS for
      Nashville and distribute them to anyone interested. Ed and I
      even have had the chance to send a couple files back the other
      way.

      I would like to do some more in this great new age which is
      dawning. I am not a programmer though so that leaves out quite
      a few of the fun type jobs <grin>. I have been listening and
      watching and helping tie my local network into some of the new
      support and informational networks. EET (the School Electronics
      BBS) has recently started carrying the SDN and through a fellow
      network member, Jerry Dunlap of Dickson County BBS, I brought in
      DVNet to Nashville and with permission both he and I carry the
      support files online. But now an even better idea has come to
      mind!

      In the backbone echo ECHO_REQ you can post and read about
      queries, requests to link into echos, and new echo
      announcements. As an alternative and with the growing interest
      in file echos, I recently suggested an echo conference where one
      might find information about file echos, support networks, and
      distribution systems. Information on what goes with what and who
      to contact to get linked in. Maybe even a few folks there to ask
      how the traffic is and what to expect. Still other alternatives
      are starting  new file echos or support networks. So an new echo
      conference is born: "FILE_REQ"

      I had in mind some ideas for support/informational networks
      myself to either link into or help create. One is an electronics
      info & programs network and the other is a CAD netWork. The
      other BBS I run here in Nashville is at a technical college and
      sponsored by the electronics engineering technologies
      department. It has plenty of electronics oriented  programs but
      there are always different ones which do specific anylaysis and
      help with design projects. Most time one ends up writing a
      program which already exists or if you go looking ..well.. this
      may take a while. More recently the only board here in Nashville
      that was carrying an AutoCAD file area and the national backbone
      echo A_CAD went down. So I set aside about 20M and put CAD-CAM
      and A_CAD online. And with the aid of a very active AutoCAD user
      it has become a regular CAD hangout in the community. Now don't

      get me wrong ..I have in mind a few more selfish reasons to
      ..I would like to see a national ANSI file echo <grin> and
      I'd be willing to bet there are some more great ideas all of
      us have in common.


      So far FILE_REQ is avaliable from Nashville, TN at 1:116/29,
      and from NEC18 Amnon Nissan at 1:151/1003 and 100, and Dean
      Lachan (Region 19) 1:124/4115, and (Region 13 and Tick Central)

                   CURMUDGEON TOSS RULES at the
                  REGION 17 FIDONET(r) CONVENTION
                 (Thanks to Ken Zwaschka, 1:105/54)

     1. Due to  budgetary constraints, a surprising reluctance of Nike
        and    other    local   athletic  shoe  companies  to  provide
        sponsorship,  and  the intervention of government agencies who
        simply do not understand, the "Curmudgeon Bungee Diving" event
        promised as a  highlight  at  the Region17 Convention has been
        replaced by an equally exciting contest:  "Curmudgeon Tossing"
        at the Menucha swimming pool.

     2. "Curmudgeon Tossing" is a team  sport.    Teams may consist of
        two or more individuals.

     3. Since there is only one Curmudgeon,  and  there will certainly
        be a large number of contestants, teams must provide their own
        Curmudgeon Clone who meets the following criteria:

        A. Must be a human being (at least in the  biological  sense);
           otherwise, animal rights  activists have threatened a major
           media event.

        B. Must  be  a  current    *C  in  the  FidoNet  organization.
           (Handicap points will be awarded based on the *C's ranking:
           e.g.  1 point for an N*C, 2 points for an R*C, etc.)

        C. Additional  handicap points will be awarded for  Curmudgeon
           Clones  attired  in Levis, a flannel shirt, and Birkenstock
           sandals (1 point for each item.)

        D. The Curmudgeon Clone must be a _WILLING_ participant, prior
           to the beginning  of  the  TOSS,  and may withdraw to a hot
           shower at any time.

     4. Objective:  TOSS the Curmudgeon Clone into the exact center of
        the 30x75' pool from the "long" end.  The Curmudgeon Clone can
        help  (by  diving toward the center) - or hinder (depending on
        HOW willingly he offered to participate.) Although not against
        the rules, it is  considered  unCurmudgeonlike  to  indicate -
        until the last minute - the degree of cooperation the team can
        expect from the Curmudgeon Clone.

     5. Each team will get three tries,with their best score counting.

     6. Although points will be carefully logged,  final standing will
        be  based  on  the  totally  subjective anarchical/dictatorial
        decision of the Judgeon.

     FidoNews 7-21                Page 15                  21 May 1990


        Certificates will be awarded in the following categories:

          No comment, mention or acknowledgement (the highest rating -
          for silence from the Curmudgeon is the best recognition!)

          Take it to another echo

          Dweeb

     7. There will be  no  winner:    just  cold,  wet, shivering, and
        humiliated *C's - that should be MORE than enough.

     8. The JUDGEON will, of  course,  be  the CURMUDGEON himself.  No
        decisions will be final, and can  be  disputed,  debated,  and
        flamed endlessly without any resolution.

                   SIGN FRIENDS-A Sign Language Tutorial

     One of my callers, Fran O'Gorman, wrote a program designed to
     teach sign language using a computer. I was so impressed by the
     program and its ability to help many people in all parts of the
     world that I offered to be a distribution point for the program.
     In addition I will be hosting an echo supporting SIGN FRIENDS. I
     asked Fran to write a little article about her program and I
     present it here.

                                 ********

     Sign Friends is an interactive program designed to teach sign
     language utilizing the graphic and animation capabilities of the
     computer.   Compressed into 3 files, so that it can be extracted
     onto either a floppy or hard drive system, it consists of SIGN1
     (file name is SIGN37-1.EXE) and SIGN2 (file name SIGN37-2.EXE)
     and SIGN3 (file name SIGN37-3.EXE).  A .DOC file (SIGN.DOC) also
     accompanies these, describing installation procedures.

     Written in GWBasic, the user will need either that or BASICA if
     he/she has a true IBM, and CGA capabilities in order to run the
     program.  Further details are described in a read.me file
     included with the programs.

     Sign Friends is topically arranged according to chapters of
     approximately seven words each, with the exception of the
     alphabet and numbers.  There are over 200 words to date in Sign
     friends.  An index concludes SIGN1 and SIGN3.  Each chapter
     includes a practice and a test portion.  Student results are
     displayed at the end of each test.  Sign Friends is totally
     menu-driven and requires little or no computer competence for
     its use.  The vocabulary is on an elementary level, little
     reading ability is required, thus it is suitable for use with
     children as well as adults.  The program includes a
     fingerspeller.

     Sign Friends was written for my brain-injured child who, while
     hearing, is unable to speak and depends on sign for expressive
     communication.  It is my hope that a world more fluent in sign
     will be a world more accessible to her and children like her.

                                     Fran O'Gorman

                                 ********

     SIGN FRIENDS is available here on the Monroe Electronic Mall
     (1:272/94) as self extracting files:

     and as ZIPPED files:

     discussion of SIGN FRIENDS. If you would like to partake in an
     echo about this program please contact me for setting it up. If
     enough interest is generated in the echo I will request backbone
     tie-in at a future date. Your input on this program will enable
     Fran to add additional chapters and refine the program to help
     all those who need it.

     Programmer and Tester --

     My neighbors and I had an interesting discussion concerning the
     relative merits of large software projects and software quality
     control.  Really it was two on one, with myself (micro software
     and minimum person project advocate) and Mike (mainframe
     software project manager and tired of the maximum person
     projects) versus Ken (workstation software salesman and
     wondering why developers can't make software without bugs).

     I'll spare you the details of the opening volleys of small
     versus large projects, time and cost considerations and the
     personal biases of each of the participants.  The really
     interesting part was about the role of software tester.

     Primary to the argument was the role and relative skill level
     of the software testing team, or Quality Control group.  From a
     cost and marketing standpoint, it behooves a company to get
     lots of experts testing and retesting a software product before
     it goes out the door.  Support dollars spent up front rather
     than later when you have an irate customer.  Sort of a pay me
     now or pay me later kind of approach.

     An often overlooked criteria for the software tester is that
     he/she must possess about the same skill level as the end user.
     This does not mean experts, and certainly not developers.  This
     works well for two reasons, 1) you can't get developers to test
     other people's software and 2) you can't get developers to make
     'uninformed' decisions about what actually needs to be tested
     and how to test.

     The bottom line ?  Hire a few computer literate high-schoolers
     this summer to run through all your software functions.  Give
     them the documentation, a diskette, and a stack of Problem
     Report sheets.


     Window Washer --

     Windows 3.0 arrived over at my pardners BIG WINDOWS development
     shop.  It sure is pretty.  Unfortunately, without the /r
     switch, none of his existing apps will run.  Looks like upgrade
     time for a bunch of software.

     I was unhappy with one important feature, SETUP install new
     applications.  You get several options for scanning to look for
     PIFs, etc.  but no specific way to install ONE new app, for
     example one that you just unarced.  Setup gives you options
     like whole disk and just path;  on a big disk, this is a real
     pain.

     Sure is pretty though.  I've been trying to think how I could
     really use it.  Seems to me that WordPerfect, ScanMan and
     Ventura would fit the publishing bill.  I'm a Brief/MS C kind
     of guy, that's character mode too.  All the good comm programs
     are character mode.  Lotus is still numero uno.

     I guess it's true, you are what you are.  Lot's of folks have
     called me a character;  no one has ever called me an icon.


     Honey's New Car --

     "Well I got me a car, it's as big as a whale, and it's about to
     set sail...  Yeah I got me a Chrysler, it seats about twenty,
     so hurry up, and bring your juke box money...  Well the Love
     Shack is a little old place where, we can GET TOGETHER...
     Love Shack baby..."

     I can not believe these car dealers.  Used to be, they'd snap
     up a profit, turn that money into another car, and smile doing
     it.  Now days, it appears, they think they got something
     special.

     Hey New Car Dealers :  We all know your manufacturers invoice
     price, and how that includes your 3% volume rebate, and 1%
     marketing fund.  You make money selling it 'below cost' !  What
     really hurts is the amount of time wasted HAGGLING, especially
     when you start bidding at sticker plus !

     "Love Shack, that's where it's at, Love Shack, baby, that's
     where it's at..."

     Just goes to show, it's who you know, not what.  I got a buddy
     who runs a leasing company; he has a fleet number and
     apparently, all three of us made money, but I got my price !  I
     drove out exactly 14 hours after calling him.

     It sure is pretty, Junebug <smile>.

     "Bang, bang, bang on the door baby... I can't hear you.  BANG
     BANG, on the door baby, BANG BANG on the door baby, WHAT ?"
     ( (C) B-52 Cosmic Thing )
