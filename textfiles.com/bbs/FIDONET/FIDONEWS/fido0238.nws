                                   Settling In

          Well,  I'm finally getting settled in my  new  location.  We
          recently  sold  our house and ended up not buying a new one,
          but that's another story (and a very long  one).  We're  now
          living in an apartment.

          It still doesn't feel like home, but it's getting there.  At
          least  I  no longer have to mow the lawn or shovel the snow.
          I won't really  be  comfortable  though  until  I  get  some
          shelves up and unpack all my books.  One thing moving proved
          to me -- I own too darn many books.

          Moving  my  hardware was less of a hassle than I'd expected.
          I backed up everything,  ran SHIPDISK,  and took  the  whole
          thing  apart.  After  trucking  it  across  town I set it up
          again and turned it on.  Everything was  fine.  I  was  down
          about two hours.

          We  had some hassle with the phone numbers,  but 1/1 has the
          right number in the new node list (I checked it personally).
          I know at least one person out there is trying to send us an
          article -- my phone has been  ringing  off  the  wall  every
          night  from  four  to  five for a week.  Maybe now he'll get
          through.

          I hope so.  This change of phone numbers has  had  it's  bad
          points.  We've  gotten  almost no submissions this week.  We
          had a couple on file,  and Ben Baker starts  his  column  on
          routing  this  week,  so it's not a total loss,  but I'll be
          glad when things get back to normal.

          That's right,  folks!  We need  your  input.  Start  writing
          those  articles and sending them in.  Get your hands on node
          list 305 and mail your article to node 1/1.  If you  want  a
          copy  of the technical specs,  drop us a line and we'll mail
          it to you.

          We're not really a bulletin board here,  so don't  count  on
          much  if you call.  We've got a little thing running to pass
          out the newsletter and such,  but it isn't up often.  We  do
          all our work by netmail, generally.

          So go write something and netmail it to us!

                                 THE DIRTY DOZEN
                            Issue #3: Oct 30th, 1985
                              Compiled by Tom Neff

          Recently, many unlawfully copied or modified programs have
          appeared on various IBM PC bulletin boards across the
          country.  THE DIRTY DOZEN is a list of known examples.

          There are three major categories of "bogusware": commercial
          pirate jobs, unauthorized "hacks" of otherwise legitimate
          freeware programs, and malicious "TROJAN" programs which
          damage your system.  A more detailed explanation of each
          category is given below.

          Sysops: Please be careful with the files you post in your
          download libraries!  Be suspicious when an uploaded game or
          disk utility appears to be of professional quality, yet
          doesn't include the author's name, address, and distribution
          policy.  Such programs are probably NOT public domain!

          The BBS community is already under legislative threat at the
          State and Federal level.  We cannot fight this trend
          effectively while our directories sit stocked with "cracked"
          Sega games, 1-2-3 copiers and Wargames dialers!  Let's
          demonstrate a little social responsibility by cleaning up
          our download libraries.  If you have any of these files on
          your system, please delete them and post "blocking" dummy
          file entries like this one:

                  ZAXXON.COM        DELETED!! NOT PUBLIC DOMAIN!!

          A final word on TROJANS: I have been hearing more and more
          reports of these "worm" programs, from all directions.
          While I don't doubt their existence (and all that I have
          heard of are listed below), let's not get hysterical.
          Remember, a Trojan rumor is a lot easier to START than it is
          to STOP.  Some people have accused "legitimate" *joke*
          programs, like DRAIN (which pretends to be gurgling excess
          water out of your A drive) of being "killers." Even if a
          program locks up your system, it isn't necessarily Trojan;
          it might not like co-residing with Superkey, or your
          graphics card.  Ask around a little before you announce
          something as Trojan.  I would appreciate a bagged specimen
          of any Real trojan program you find.

                                     you are.  SEA won't support the

                                     killer and renamed it
                                     DOSKNOWS.EXE, so it would be
                                     confused with the real, harmless
                                     DOSKNOWS system-status utility.
                                     All I know for sure is that the
                                     REAL DOSKNOWS.EXE is 5376 bytes
                                     long.  If you see something
                                     called DOSKNOWS that isn't close
                                     to that size, sound the alarm.
                                     More info on this one is welcomed

                     Ripping off Tom Jennings, and all of us

          Billion-dollar corporations are ripping off Tom Jennings,
          author of the Fido software that all of us are beneficiaries
          of.  This software was written by Jennings and is
          copyrighted by him, and a great deal of work was done by a
          small number of others, some of whom have copyrighted
          utilities, some of whom just pitched in.  Moreover, one
          billion-dollar corporation is ripping off hundreds of
          SysOps, potentially everyone who has put his or her own
          time, effort and money into running a BBS, and, for bad
          measure, everyone who's ever shared a utility or program
          they worked on by uploading it to a BBS library, and
          everyone who's helped just by "passing on" good things to
          make them available on BBSes other than where you got them.

          I'm going to give two examples of this.  Both of the
          corporations involved have revenues in the billions, and
          neither of them has contacted Jennings for permission,
          license, or paid any fees to him.  Neither has the first
          giant pirate contacted any of *us* or offered us any say in
          whether we want to be raw material--the only raw material it
          has to market.

          I want to encourage every Fido SysOp and every Fido user to
          collect transcripts from any corporate users they know
          about, so that Jennings and his lawyers may collect fees and
          damages from them.  Secondly, I want to encourage everyone
          with a modem to spread this article and its associated files
          to every BBS in the country, in particular all of those
          which are listed as raw material, the products, that GTE is
          marketing; but every other BBS is fair game as well.

                                   GTE TELENET

          If you subscribe to Byte or PC Magazine (and many others)
          you can see the ad that rips off both Jennings and every
          SysOp.  In the October Byte it's on page 365.  In the
          October 29 PC Magazine, it's on Page 90.  Full-page ads
          both.

          They show a guy touching the ground and say "Now you don't
          have to pay this much to access information with your home
          computer."  How much?  "Now for only $25 a month (plus a
          one-tme installation fee of $25) you'll be able to reach
          othr PC subscribers free.  Free local databases and bulletin
          boards..."

          When I accessed the number given--800-835-3001--I made a
          transcript of my interaction.  It shows Fido 10m in use,
          with several thousand callers already.  I was mad already on
          Jennings' behalf.

          But when I examined the limited files area i could access
          without paying those fees, I really hit the ceiling.  What

          are these free databases?  Boys and girls, it's us they're
          selling for $25 a month and a $25 installation fee.  If
          you're a SysOp, they want you.  You may not want a bunch of
          users who are paying a billion-dollar company for all the
          work you do maintaining your BBS, you may not want a bunch
          of freeloaders who'll siphon off all your downloads and
          block your regular and valued users from access.  But, see,
          you're part of the merchandise.  I'd have no hesitation at
          all about suing GTE if LawSIG, predecessor to Fido LawCAT,
          were on that list.  No doubt they'll catch up to Minnesota
          soon.  PC Pursuit is what General Tel and El calls their
          service, and folks, they're after us.

          Now, how about you BBS users who *aren't* sysops?  Quite a
          few of you are the "communicators" who make BBSes the
          overwhelming *private* and *person-to-person* communications
          successes they are.  You are always willing (and often able)
          to help out another user with hardware and software tips,
          advice, encouragement.  You often upload aids and utilities
          you developed yourself, just because you want to share them
          with others, for the general good of computing.  Sometimes
          you've written fairly elaborate applications, which you
          distribute through BBSes, relying on fairness of those who
          find your package useful to pay you a fair fee--and you
          don't think Lotus, MicroSoft, and the Big Money software
          giants are charging fair fees, in the big bks$ that pay for
          all their ad campaigns.

          Okay, so your software is part of what GTE is marketing for
          just $25 a month and a $25 "installation fee" whatever that
          means.  Do you suppose many GTE subscribers will also pay
          you?  I am damn sure that no GTE subscribers who access my
          system will ever send me any little sums "to help out with
          your costs and to thank you for doing this for all of us,"
          and I'm pretty damn sure I won't get any thankyous from the
          GTE crowd whose corporations are paying that tiny fee for
          them.

          I don't like having my hard work and love of these systems
          exploited by a multibillion dollar corporation.  So how do
          you feel about it, fellow SysOps?  Users who upload as well
          as download, how do you folks feel about this violation and
          exploitation of our community?

          Now let's look at another problem, the private corporate
          piracy that's ripping off someone all we Fido users have
          greatly benefitted from.  Dozens, perhaps hundreds, of
          corporations have picked upthe Fido software and set up
          their own private in-house nets.  Did they contact Tom
          Jennings, whose copyright and address cannot be avoided when
          you run Fido? They did not.  Did they pay the modest $100 he
          initially asked for "commercial" use of Fido?  Don't be
          silly.

          There is some financial institution in the Twin Cities which
          is using Fido; the banker proudly boasted on Fido LawCAT
          that he is a follower of Ayn Rand's "money=goodness"
          philosophy.  "Why should I pay for what others get for


          Fidonews                   Page  7                4 Nov 1985





          free?" he said.  I can't give his transcript, because he
          left it in a message, which he later snuck back on and
          killed.

          I do have a transcript of my interaction with a private
          corporate Fidonet.  This one's operated by Honeywell, Inc.,
          a multibillion-dollar corporation headquartered in
          Minneapolis, which, unlike many of them, has extended a
          periscope into our national Fidonet--although you can't get
          onto it, and they don't reply to Fidomail sent to them.

          Unless you've been authorized by company security, you get
          shunted right off that system.  They have the nerve even to
          use the trademarked "Fido" hound John Madill drew.  The
          Military Avionics Division of Honeywell, which pirated this
          software, is responsible for approximately $390,000,000 of
          Honeywell's annual revenues.  You'd think they could afford
          to pay for it, instead of stealing it, as they have done.

          Jennings told me that he and others know of scores of
          corporate ripoffs.  These include Southwestern Bell, which
          attempted to charge a 15-year-old $100 a month, because he
          had a modem on his home phone to run a BBS two years ago.
          They include 3M, another multibillion-dollar Minnesota
          giant, whose corporate employees contacted local Fido SysOps
          for setup help, because they didn't know enough to earn
          their salaries carrying out their theft unaided by their
          victims.

          Because we're all their victims, victims of these corporate
          thieves.  How long can the BBS culture, which we created
          ourselves, last in the face of this massive exploitation?
          Who will want to give away his or her work, only to see
          gross profits racked up from it by giant corporate
          exploiters?

                            WHAT WE CAN AND SHOULD DO

          First collect any information you can get about commercial
          users.  Jennings knows who has paid him (all 11 of them) and
          who hasn't, so don't attempt to find that out; just collect
          their names and phone numbers.  If possible, collect
          evidentiary transcripts, as I have done, as complete as
          possible, if you can get on the system at all.  Send these,
          together with a statement as to how you know who the
          corporate or government users are to me at Fido LawCAT
          14/999.  The statement should be like mine; it should ID
          yourself, and give contact information (address/phone).  If
          Jennings can afford to hire a lawyer, the lawyer can use
          such transcripts as evidence to collect for the unauthorized
          use of the copyrighted software.

          What is a "commercial user"?  Jennings defined for me what
          he had in mind as "Who can use it for free," it is those who
          are creating Fidos "in the public interest."  In general,
          anyone who operates a BBS accessible to the general public
          is doing that, whether there is a registration fee or
          "special interest group" limitation. A store that runs a


          Fidonews                   Page  8                4 Nov 1985





          public BBS, a company that operates a public BBS as a good-
          will gesture, are examples of "public interest" users who
          can use it free.

          A government agency, a corporation, or an individual who
          expects to make a profit from the use of a private Fido, or
          Fidonet, or to use it for internal convenience of its staff,
          or in the carrying out of its mission or duties--these are
          examples of Fido users who must pay a license fee for the
          first node, and another for each additional node, as set by
          Fido Marketing.  Both GTE, which intends to make a profit
          from using Fido to exploit all the rest of us, and
          Honeywell, which intends "for the convenience of its
          employees" to maintain a private Fidonet, are excellent
          examples of users who must and should be made to pay Fido
          Software's fees.

          Any group which is in doubt about its status should apply to
          Jennings at Fido 125/1 for clarification as to whether it
          qualifies as a public interest group, or not.  In general,
          every "private" Fido, to which access cannot be gained by
          "normal" registration by responsible users should probably
          apply to Jennings, and should expect to pay a reasonable fee
          for its use of his software.

          In fact, the issues raised by widespread corporate and
          perhaps governmental piracy of Jennings' copyrighted
          software are relatively simple to resolve.  All he needs is
          money to hire a lawyer; there would be no problem collecting
          fees (and costs and perhaps damages) from both Honeywell and
          GTE--if Jennings could afford to hire the help he'd need to
          do it.

          Some of you who've enjoyed and benefited from your use of
          Fido might think about that and send Jennings a little money
          to help do that.  Lawyers don't come cheap.

                                 THE OTHER ISSUE

          There is a much more difficult issue raised by GTE's
          commercial exploitation of all BBSes and of virtually
          everyone who uses a BBS.  We are all resources for each
          other, in BBSes, whether networked like Fido or not.  The
          knowledge and talents of each user are part of a pool of
          resources we all share by means of these systems.  It is
          exactly that--US--that GTE is selling.  I'm not sure what I
          can do about it, unless and until they list my Fido LawCAT.
          Should they do so, whatever it costs in time and money, I'll
          sue them.

          How do the rest of you feel?  Let's have some discussion of
          this exploitation, while there are still BBSes alive to do
          it on.  I feel that this commercial exploitation of our work
          will so disgust a great many SysOps that the system will be
          destroyed by these sharks who are moving in to profiteer off
          of it.

          It should be discussed on all BBSes. I invite SysOps and

          users to contribute ideas to the "Issues" message/discussion
          section (Msg Area 10) on Fido LawCAT, 612-872-2352; or
          FMAIL--I'll see if I can recopy it and post it--at 14/999.
          Though there are relatively few modem-using lawyers, it has
          been my intention since 1982 to educate them to "computer
          law issues" by involving them in discussions with the
          computer community, and exposing them to specific legal
          problems computers raise.  Software piracy is an issue
          LawSIG has done a lot of educating on over the years.  Now
          we have a new one, I don't even know how to describe it.
          GTE wants to steal *all of us* in effect, and piracy of Tom
          Jennings' software is a means to that larger theft.  What
          kind of a crime is that?  How can lawyers help us prevent
          it?

          I appologise for the length of this piece; I feel the issues
          are urgent, and the matter needs to be spread around
          quickly.

          Any Libertarians out there?

          Daniel Tobias, FIDO 129/13


          I am presently attempting to put together, for future
          publication, a directory of Libertarians who are reachable
          by electronic mail.  Someday, computerized communication may
          take its place alongside the telephone and the postal system
          as a commonplace form of communication, butcurrently only a
          select group of forward-thinking individuals enjoys this
          powerful communication tool.  Since those supporting the
          Libertarian philosophy of personal and economic freedom and
          drastically limited government are also forward-thinking
          people, it is reasonable to suppose that many of them are
          already making use of computerized communications.  The
          intent of the directory is to put all such people's names
          and computer mail addresses together in one place, to
          facilitate communication and informal networking among them.
          If you wish to be listed, please send me the following
          information, in the order given:

          a) Your name.

          b) Your computer mail address(es).  Include here the
             addresses which can be used to send you computer mail.
             These can be on any computer system or network, including
             FidoNet, ArpaNet, UUCP, BitNet, or CompuServe.  If you
             have computer addresses on several different networks,
             include all of them.

          c) Include, if you wish, a single line describing your
             occupation, position in Libertarian organizations,
             special interests, or anything else you feel is
             descriptive of yourself so that prospective electronic
             "pen-pals" who do not know you by name can find people
             who share common interests.

          You have several ways of getting this information to me.
          You can send it by FidoMail to 'Daniel Tobias' at FIDO
          129/13.  I also can be reached as DT04@TF.CC.CMU.EDU on the
          Arpanet.  Or, if you prefer a more old-fashioned means of
          communication, you may send it on paper to:

                         FidoNet Route Files Explained
                      Part 1 -- The Many Faces of FidoNet

                           by Ben Baker, Fido 100/76

               There  is  no  aspect  of FidoNet more universally mis-
          understood than routing.  It is the  intent  of  this  foru-
          part series to clear some of the fog.

               The   justification  for  nets  and  routing  has  been
          discussed many times and will NOT be  discussed again  here.
          Given  that  routing  is  good,  how is it done?  What's the
          meaning of the various statements that go into route  files?
          Indeed, what's the meaning of route files?

               Let's first take a look at "the network." But how do we
          do that?  In reality, there is no "the network." FidoNet  is
          a  different  thing when viewed by each different Fido!  The
          only formal definition of FidoNet is the node list,  and  it
          serves  as  an  adaquate  view  of  "the  network"  for most
          independent Fidos but only the members of some nets.

               Consider  the  hypothetical  node,  Fido 21/7.  He's an
          independent member of a "Region." To him, "the network" is a
          couple  of  hundred other independent nodes to whom he sends
          messages directly and another couple of hundred to which  he
          has  access  through  36  defined  "Hosts." If he receives a
          message not addressed to his node, his  Fido  "orphans"  it.
          He has no intention of forwarding someone else's mail.  They
          can pay their own phone bills!  When he sends a  message  to
          18/3,  Fido  knows  (from  the  node  list)  that is another
          independent and sends the message direct.  When he  sends  a
          message to 100/76, Fido knows (from the node list) that is a
          member of net 100 and sends it to 100/0.  Fido 21/7 executes
          only  schedule A during the national mail window.  He has no
          use for ANY route files.

               Another hypothetical node, Fido 201/4 is a member of an
          "inbound  only"  net.   Since  the  sysop  has  used the '4'
          command properly, Fido knows he is a member of net  201  and
          will  treat  other  members  of that net as though they were
          independent nodes.  When he sends a message to  201/5,  Fido
          will  send it direct and not to 201/0.  Messages headed out-
          side net 201 will be handled for 201/4 just as they were for
          21/7.   Fido  201/4  executes  two  schedules,  A during the
          national window followed immediatly by B when he  just  sits
          quietly  and  waits  for  201/0  to  send  him  any  mail he
          received.  He has no use for ANY route files.

               Everyone   else  has  a  view  of  "the  network"  more
          complicated than Fido can discover from just the node  list.
          If  you're a Southern California Hub, or a local node in the
          New York Megalopolis, or maybe the host of a modest  network
          in  Memphis  "the  network"  looks  different to you than to

          other sysops.  It is the function of route files  to  modify
          Fido's view of "the network" to conform to yours.

               If your Fido is executing any mail event and any  other
          Fido calls it up and offers it a mail packet, your Fido will
          graciously receive that packet and at the end  of  the  mail
          event,  he will unpack it into messages.  These actions have
          nothing whatever to do with route files!

               Reread  that last paragraph two or three times until it
          sinks in.  It is a very important, very misunderstood point.
          Route  files  do  not and cannot control the way you receive
          mail.  ROUTE FILES CONTROL ONLY THE  WAY  YOU  SEND  MAIL!!!
          After all, that's when you're paying the phone bill.

               Furthermore,  what  you  say  in ROUTE.B has absolutely
          nothing to do with how Fido behaves in schedule C.   I  will
          come back to this point later.

               Ever since we first began routing FidoNet  messages  to
          places  other than their final destination, route files have
          used three basic commands to mold Fido's view of FidoNet  to
          correspond  with  your  view.   In  part  2  we will look at
          SCHEDULE, ROUTE-TO and ACCEPT-FROM and  see  just  how  they
          influence Fido.

               Part  3  will  examine  a  bevy of new routing commands
          available with Fido V11 and see how they have made automatic
          distribution at last possible.

               LISTGEN  V2  is capable of generating route files auto-
          matically.  Part 4 will discuss how ROUTE.CTL statements map
          to route file commands.

               Stay  with  me  for the next few weeks and maybe we can
          burn off the fog and find a bright sky, a calm sea and clear
          sailing.   (And  don't  throw  away your newsletters, you'll
          want to refer back from time to time.)

          ============================================================

          Hello to all the Fido News readers south of the border !!

          I am writing this in an attempt to find out if there is a
          chance that there might be a similar machine to the one that
          we are looking at purchasing (and or leasing.)

          I guess I should explain what it is that I am planning on
          leasing (or purchasing, I can dream I guess!) The system is
          called the Kurzweil 4000 and comes from Kurzweil Computer
          Products in Massachusetts and is an excellent optical
          character recogntion system that uses artificial
          intelligence software.

          The person running the system "teaches" the system the font
          or type style in a learning session, (the learning session
          can take from 5 to 30 mins depending on the type style or
          condition of the document read). Once the learning session
          has taken place the system can retain what it has learned
          for future use on the hard drive that comes with the system.
          The 4000 can handle type setting or word processing codes,
          ligatures, and special formatting instructions. The 4000
          analyzes each character by analyzing its shape, it can
          recognize any type font in sizes ranging from 6 to 24 point,
          including multiple fonts within a single document.

          Now that you know what the system is capable of (and no I am
          not a Kurzweil salesman!!!) You might know of a similar
          system ( I cant really say clone system with its power!)
          that is slightly lower priced!

          You see Xerox Canada has grabbed this and have priced the
          system at approx $85,000 with all the bells and whistles!
          In the States it is priced at about $40,000 U.S. !!!!!  Even
          with the exchange Xerox is taking myself and other
          interested parties for a ride!!!!

          Would you believe they want $7,550 for a *&*&!!@ sheet
          feeder !! Well you get the point I will not bitch any
          longer.

          You say why not buy it from Kurzweil directly! Well Kurzweil
          stands firm on Xerox and will not sell one to us as it under
          contractual obligation to Xerox !!!

          If you have any information about a similar product in the
          States or anywhere else for that matter I would appreciate
          you dropping me a line at Fido 111/608.

          (please note that the system has changed its number and has
          yet be updated in the latest nodelist. The number is
          1-416-231-7113.)

          Thanks for your time

          Am sad to report the death of fido 17/2 on Monday  the  27th
          of  October.  The  death  will  be  caused by an overdose of
          corporate oversight. Said impending death was reported to me
          by the DJ today.  The company could no longer see any profit
          other than goodwill and so issued the notice of execution.

                           A Warning to Quadram Owners

          If you own a Quadram board with an on-board  clock  that  is
          over  a  year  old,  BEWARE!  The batteries on some of these
          boards have been reported to go bad and leak,  dripping acid
          on the motherboard.

          The  batteries to worry about are those with a green stripe.
          The batteries with a black stripe are okay.

          Quadram is reportedly aware of the problem, and taking steps
          to deal with it.
