     Too many people are taking  things  too  damned  seriously  these
     days.  Listen  to  some of the chatter going on -- you'd think we
     were planning how to run the world  here.  Intermixed  with  that
     are  plaintive  cries  from sysops wondering what happened to all
     the fun they used to have.  The two go  hand  in  hand.  Lots  of
     people  aren't having any fun because they let themselves take it
     all so seriously.  But let's step back for a minute  and  try  to
     put it all in perspective.

     The  weighty  issues of the day mostly revolve around how the net
     should be managed.  Who does this affect?  Let's be  liberal  and
     say  that it affects every sysop and every user of every bulletin
     board everywhere.  That's a lot of people, right?  Okay, how many
     people?  Hundreds of thousands?  A million?

     In other words, at most it affects less than a tenth of a percent
     of all the people in the United States.  Of  all  the  rest,  few
     would  ever  understand  what we're doing,  and fewer still would
     understand why anyone would ever want to do that.

     So let's stop putting on airs and telling ourselves what a  great
     and wonderful thing we're doing.  Sure, we like it (sometimes, at
     least),  but  we're  not  going  to change the face of the world.
     Let's take it for what it is -- a hobby.  Something to do in  our
     spare time for the fun of it.

     Whatever you're doing,  be it net coordinator, echomail backbone,
     or just plain sysop,  if it isn't fun,  then why do it?  There is
     no  reason.  You  "owe  it"  to others?  Sounds nice,  maybe even
     makes you feel good about it,  but that's not a valid reason.  If
     you don't enjoy doing it, then stop doing it.  If it's important,
     then  someone  else will start doing it.  Or if nobody else takes
     over, then maybe it wasn't all that important after all.

     Just to show that there really is nothing new under the sun, this
     is actually a common phase for new hobbys to go through.  Science
     fiction fans went through  this  about  thirty  years  ago,  with
     opposing  camps  shouting  "FIAWOL!" and "FIJAGH!" at each other.
     Those terms, by the way,  stand for "Fandom Is A Way Of Life" and
     "Fandom Is Just A Goddam Hobby".  So I'll add a new one: FNIJAGH!
     FidoNet Is Just A Goddam Hobby!

     Brad Hicks
     Sysop WeirdBase, 1:100/523
     Director-at-Large, IFNA

                        "I  find  this  article by Brad  Hicks  to  be
                        excessively  annoying at best and an  out  and
                        out fabrication at worst. I will stop one step
                        short  of accusing Mr Hicks of  maliciousness,
                        and  state the facts are totally wrong.  As an
                        IFNA member and sysop,  I  would like to see a
                        WRITTEN  retraction  in  the  next  issue  of
                        FIDONEWS." -- Bob Hoffman

     It  mildly  annoys  me that the only response I've gotten  to  my
     recent  article in FidoNews showed that the respondents  actually
     read very little of the article.   Instead of actually discussing
     POLICY4, the responses centered around one trivial matter of per-
     sonalities.   For example,  Don Daniels said to me  on  November
     10th:

         "As  you  should  know by now,  Bob Hoffman  feels  that  you
         misrepresented the truth in your recent article  in  FIDONEWS
         in  which  you referred to him and some of his actions.   ...
         if your statements can't be substantiated,  I  strongly  urge
         you to provide not only  a  retraction  in FIDONEWS,  but  an
         apology to Bob as well."

     Former president Ken Kaplan's letter,  on November 11th, was even
     stronger:

         "Unfortunately  you  don't know when to stop  beating  a dead
         horse.  Your FidoNews article was chock full of personal slam
         dunks and Bob Hoffman took it all very serious as I would  if
         I were him."

     Mind you, I got all both of these letters before I actually heard
     anything  from Bob Hoffman --  but then,  sometimes FidoNet works
     like that.   What are the real grounds for objection, here?  I'll
     let  Bob  tell  it in his own words (from a letter  to  me  dated
     November 10th):

             "COMMENTARY:   As a person who finds Bob Hoffman's use of
             another  machine  to  mimic  the one he  wanted,  thereby
             requesting  two  separate  node  numbers  from  the  same
             machine,  excessively annoying, I  would add to this '...
             directly  from the machine requesting the address,  ...'"
             -- Brad Hicks

         "...   I  did meet all the requirements that were required in
         POLICY3.  The node was up and working,  I  made  a COMMENT to
         Kurt  Reisler when discussing the request for a node  that  I
         COULD  HAVE  ORIGINATED THE REQUEST FROM ANYWHERE  (note  the
     FidoNews 4-44                Page 3                   30 Nov 1987


         word could have). There was NEVER a false request made, and I
         don't understand why this kind of slander is tolerated on the
         part  of a Director of IFNA in the OFFICIAL IFNA publication,
         against an IFNA member!" -- Bob Hoffman

     In  the  immortal  words of the current President of  the  United
     States, "Mistakes were made."   The version I told in the article
     is the story as it was told on the IFNA echomail conference.   It
     was  not  contradicted there,  so  I took it at face  value.   It
     appears that this was a mistake.  For this I very much apologize.

     But  let me also say this:  Bob's use of the  word  "slander"  is
     quite interesting in this context.   If I had said in the article
     that  Bob  Hoffman has red hair,  and he really had  brown  hair,
     would it have been slander (or libel)?   No, it would merely have
     been  a mistake.   As I said (and as Bob implies,  even  in  this
     message) it would not be a violation of POLICY3 to have done what
     mistakenly said he did!   Why then is this slander?   I  did  not
     accuse him of ANY wrong-doing!

     He  is  quite correct that I did accuse him of something  that  I
     don't like.  It also appears to be true that he didn't do it.  So
     far, so good.

     WHETHER OR NOT HE DID IT,  I'd like to see it outlawed, explicit-
     ly,  in Policy 4.   And I'm going to propose  that.   If you dis-
     agree, make sure that your representative knows how you feel.


             "COMMENTARY: I notice that as written, this section makes
             no mention of geography.   Does this mean that is =is= OK
             for  a  node  in Philadelphia to  host  the  network  for
             Arkansas?" -- Brad Hicks

         "The Arkansas NET (383) is not hosted from Philadelphia,  but
         from Pittsburgh again Mr Hicks,  in his zeal to point fingers
         may have at least gotten his facts straight!" -- Bob Hoffman

     After all,  Pittsburgh  is  much  closer  to Arkansas than Phila-
     delphia is, right?  OK,  the facts were wrong, but the difference
     is  negligible.   It's  =still=  not in Arkansas!   Again,  Bob's
     vehemence surprises me.  Is it really an insult to accuse someone
     from Pittsburgh of actually being in Philadelphia?  Is there some
     regional  nuance  here  that  a  guy   from  St.  Louis  wouldn't
     understand?

     Actually, I  suspect that Bob would love to cloud this issue with
     as many irrelevancies (like the difference between Pittsburgh and
     Philadelphia)  as  he  can bring into it ...  because he did  NOT
     address the real issue here.   Don Daniels reminded me (un-neces-
     sarily)  that, "No where in there is geography a factor.  Whether
     or  not  it SHOULD be is a matter for another  time  and  place."
     Fine,  Don.  What I'm saying is that NOW,  while we're discussing
     POLICY4,  is the time and HERE, in the only 100% world-wide forum
     on the FidoNet, is the place.  Let's discuss this!

     FidoNews 4-44                Page 4                   30 Nov 1987


     Without  even  involving personalities,  I  think that there  are
     perfectly  good  reasons  for a network host to be  within  local
     calling  distance of his or her nodes.   Here in  Net 100,  we've
     lost a network host before.   It took very little time to find  a
     new one,  because almost all of Net 100 is local calling distance
     from  each  other ...  we could work together.   If  the  Rapture
     happens  and  Bob  Hoffman  manages to squeak through,  who  will
     handle inbound mail for Arkansas?  How will they decide?

     If  someone in Arkansas wants to set up a node,  who does he call
     to  get help?   Who does he call to make that node-number request
     we  were  just talking about?   Isn't it absurd for him  to  call
     halfway across the continent?

     Bob Hoffman disagrees with me.   This is fine, this is his right.
     You might agree with me and you might disagree with me,  for good
     or for bad reasons.  WHATEVER your reasons, EITHER way, make sure
     that your Director knows!


     According  to  Ken  Kaplan,  Bob Hoffman "sent a  letter  to  Don
     Daniels  threating  [sic]  to sue IFNA for slander  if  a  public
     apology  was  not received."   This I can not pass up.   As  I've
     already  said,  neither of the things I mentioned  Bob  Hoffman's
     name  as  an example of are illegal,  nor or they  violations  of
     POLICY3,  nor do they reflect badly on his character.   (Further,
     they were written, not spoken -- it would be libel, not slander.)
     None of the elements of slander OR libel are met here.

     But even if they were,  what cause would Bob Hoffman have to  sue
     IFNA?  The public, widely repeated policy of FidoNews is to carry
     any  article  sent in by a sysop.   Further,  I  very  definitely
     prefaced my article with the following statement:

             "These are emphatically =not=  the official positions  of
             the board of directors,  but these are some of the issues
             being  discussed in IFNA_BOD echo." -- Brad Hicks

     If  Bob Hoffman needs or is deserving of a retraction  and/or  an
     apology from anyone, it's ME, =not= IFNA.


     It appears now that the person who reported to me (and to others)
     the story of how Bob Hoffman got the node number 383/0 was wrong.
     I was wrong to pass this story on without confirmation.   Had  it
     been  a serious accusation of wrong-doing,  you may rest  assured
     that  I would have been more careful.   But for my small part  in
     this tempest-in-a-teapot that has been stirred up, I apologize.

     I further apologize, if apology is needed, for having accused Bob
     Hoffman of being in Philadelphia when in fact he is, in fact,  in
     Pittsburgh.  I do =not=  apologize for disagreeing with him about
     his fitness to host ARKnet.  I am entitled to my opinion.  I will
     vote my opinion when the matter comes up.  My opinions are widely
     known,  yet I was elected to the  Board of Directors.   If that's
     not a mandate,  it's certainly a license to vote my way.  I  very
     FidoNews 4-44                Page 5                   30 Nov 1987


     much welcome well-reasoned arguments against my current position.
     It  may yet be possible to change my mind.   But aside  from  the
     irrelevancy of what city Bob Hoffman lives in,  the real issue of
     the relationship between geography and net topology remains!

     17 November 1987

     This article is being submitted to FidoNews and the IFNA echo,
     as a Canadian node (1:221/162.14), because we CANNOT freely
     express our views in the Australian region of FidoNet.
     FidoNet is now expanding rapidly outside North America and has
     already reached countries with fundamentally different
     political and social systems than the United States. In some
     parts of the world, such as Latin America and Eastern Europe,
     censorship and authoritarian political leadership are an
     accepted way of life. To preserve FidoNet's basic philosophy
     of free exchange of information, it is essential to establish
     clear guidelines BEFORE major problems arise. Where censorship
     cannot be avoided, we believe it must be imposed by local
     legal authorities directly, NOT by FidoNet coordinators
     becoming part of the censorship apparatus.

     EchoMail is a powerful new form of international interactive
     communications, potentially rivalling other kinds of mass
     media and posing serious problems for people who want to
     control access to information. At the present exponential
     growth rates, we can look forward to tens or hundreds of
     thousands of nodes or "points", and thousands of echo
     conferences, within a few years.

     The technical problems will be fascinating, and FUN to solve
     as they crop up. We will probably have to move from separately
     importing and exporting each message fairly soon.  Satellite
     broadcasts may eventually replace the Public Switched
     Telephone Network as the major carrier downstream, with phone
     calls used only to feed new items into the network, and for
     distribution from Hubs that have satellite dishes to the
     majority of nodes and points that don't.

     The political problems will not be fascinating and fun, but
     murky and unpleasant, unless they are dealt with well in
     advance. We need an accepted framework for "common carrier"
     communications with the same absence of censorship and
     discrimination as the telephone network itself. Here's a case
     history, from Australia, a country almost as similar to the
     United States as Canada, to show what can happen when such
     guidelines are not enforced. It happened in a country where
     there is NO censorship, and people are perfectly free to make
     derogatory remarks about the Prime Minister, let alone FidoNet
     Regional Coordinators, but where "control" over EchoMail
     distribution has been used for factional intrigue among
     "techie" hobbyists.

     Communet ("Communications Network for the Community") was
     setup to assist Australian non-profit community groups
     networking their computers (see FidoNews 424). We are
     developing a news service for public radio stations around
     Australia and working with ASYNC (the Australian Student
     Information Network Committee) in Brisbane and ISIS (the
     FidoNews 4-44                Page 7                   30 Nov 1987


     International Student Information Service) in Canada, on
     exchanging articles between student newspapers. None of our
     activities are POSSIBLE if we accept ANY form of censorship,
     so we've been fighting against censorship since we first
     joined FidoNet as node 3:631/326 and were immediately thrown
     out.

     We were thrown out because the Regional Coordinator for
     Australia did not like the "Political Overtones" in our
     internal file area (although he did not actually read any of
     the files!). An initial appeal determined that we were "beyond
     the acceptable limits of the normal political spectrum",
     because one of the (unread) files was called "DONTVOTE.TXT".
     We eventually won that battle, and were relisted as an
     independent, 3:59/14, by the Zone 3 Coordinator. Now we're
     refugees in Canada (1:221/162.14) because we can't accept the
     local censorship of EchoMail in Australia. We've been
     excommunicated from zone 3 for appealing to the International
     Coordinator against that censorship, despite agreeing to put
     up with until the appeal was heard. We are now waiting for an
     IC to be appointed to make a decision.

     Details of who did what are not worth going into here. The IC
     can deal with that. Suffice to say the Regional Coordinator
     for Australia, in OUR opinion behaves intolerably, but as soon
     as we try to answer his public allegations against us, and
     expose his plans for taking control over all EchoMail in the
     zone, our messages are deleted and access to EchoMail is cut
     off. The intolerable behaviour and secret plans are just our
     opinion. The deletion of messages and EchoMail cut off is an
     objective fact which nobody could dispute. Yet we have been
     ordered by the zone 3 coordinator, not to make any "derogatory
     remarks" in response to the regional coordinators public
     vituperation, and not to publish the private NetMail to us
     that proves what has been happening. Meanwhile Australian
     Sysops keep asking questions about an association of Sysops
     established in secrecy by the Regional Coordinator, and we are
     prohibited from answering publicly.

     Even when we established a long distance link to Sydney, to
     avoid the censorship in Melbourne, a message simply stating
     that we are appealing to the IC but could not reply to the
     public attacks on us in view of the ZC's orders, was deleted
     as an "attack" on the ZC by our Sydney link, who then cut off
     EchoMail just as in Melbourne. As IFNA members, we have been
     refused local access to the IFNA and POLICY4 echos to explain
     our problems, and have had to establish an international link
     to Canada to do so.

     Anyone disputing our version of the facts is welcome to plough
     through vast quantities of message copies. Here we only want
     to raise the general policy issues.
     We want IFNA to ENFORCE (not "advocate") EchoMail policies
     along the following lines:

     1. Only the Moderator of an EchoMail conference has any
     FidoNews 4-44                Page 8                   30 Nov 1987


     authority over who can participate, and what they can say in
     that conference.

     2. EchoMail distribution is a "common carrier" service, with
     distribution nodes having no right either to remove items, or
     cut links to nodes because they don't like something said in
     the conference.

     3. Any node linking through long distance calls to a
     conference is obliged to permit pickups by other local nodes
     without discrimination. Any cost sharing to be without
     discrimination.

     This last point is especially important in Australia, where it
     costs 23 cents per minute for the cheapest calls between
     adjacent major cities like Melbourne and Sydney (we have no
     service similar to PC Pursuit). If the node bringing in
     EchoMail to a city is permitted to discriminate concerning
     local pickups, there is a heavy financial penalty for
     disagreeing with that node. You could end up having to
     duplicate the pickups yourself, while other nodes share the
     costs between them. You can't just find another nearby link.
     International links to the USA are even more important, since
     most of the worthwhile Echos here are from the USA, and cost
     $1.30 per minute.

     Permitting distribution nodes to discriminate in handling
     EchoMail has helped consolidate factions around the Melbourne
     and Sydney distribution centers - with extreme bitterness
     between them, and a struggle for "control" of the zonegate,
     because each side fears the other side would discriminate if
     it had control.

     The factional mess that passes for FidoNet in Australia isn't
     worth attempting to explain here. IFNA can't sort that out.
     Australians have to do it themselves. But they can't be
     expected to do so when the publication by us, of a "private"
     message to us, containing orders from a faction as to what we
     could or could not say in an EchoMail conference, is treated
     as an offence punishable by excommunication, according to the
     zone 3 coordinator.

     The factions here would lose importance if IFNA enforced a
     rigid policy of no discrimination, by cutting EchoMail links
     to any node that will not pass those links on. The faction
     leaders would lose supporters if they no longer had "control"
     through distribution - just as nobody fears or "respects"
     their Postmaster or telephone exchange superintendent.

     Access to EchoMail from zone 1 FidoNet nodes is the main
     source of faction leaders "power" in Australia. The factional
     vituperation here is an extraordinary situation quite unlike
     anything encountered in other Australian voluntary
     associations. There is nothing about prevailing community
     attitudes in Australia to account for what is essentially a
     freak situation due to a particular constellation of
     FidoNews 4-44                Page 9                   30 Nov 1987


     personalities in a very small closed group. But IFNA has a
     duty to learn from this experience and ensure that access to
     EchoMail is never used as a source of "power" and "control" in
     other countries where such behavior might be more routine.
     POLICY4 should state clearly that links will be cut to any
     node that practises discrimination or censorship in passing on
     those links, or that fails to cut links to nodes further
     downstream that do so.

     Discussion of this issue in the IFNA echo would be welcome.
     There are also issues concerning the appeals procedures within
     FidoNet, and the factional setup in Australia.
     Detailed draft policy documents will be submitted to the
     POLICY4 echo.

      Any Australian nodes unable to obtain uncensored links
      to those two conferences or afraid to comment openly
      should NetMail us or log in direct. The ZONEREG.ARC
      utility (5K) can be used to bypass the zonegate and is
      available here for file request or downloading. Our
      modem is compatible with all CCITT and Bell standards to
      2400 baud. Zone 1 nodes should route through 221/162 to
      avoid paying international call charges for crash
      messages or file attaches. Zone 3 nodes and others wishing
      to call direct should add the following lines to the private
      net list used by XLATLIST.CTL, to call us 1480/14

     all  comments  but wish to get a general feeling from the network
     about this proposed change.


                        Nodelist Flag Draft Document
                         Primary Author: Ray Gwinn
                       Secondary Author: David Dodell
                    Contact 114/15 or 1/0 with comments
                            Version 1 (11-15-87)


     I proposed that the Nodelist (comment) Flags be replaced  with  a
     capabilities identifier.

     After  all,  the  bottom  line  is  that  we  want  to  know  the
     capabilities of the remote node before it is  contacted.  If  the
     remote  is  not capable of performing the desired function,  then
     there is no need to contact it.

     The problem(s) with the existing method  is  that  it  originally
     started  as  a  comment  field  and  was not planed.  At the time
     SEAdog was the only  "extended  protocol"  program  around.  But,
     along  came  Opus  with a different "extended protocol".  I think
     that additional flags like WZ, BR, WR,  etc is only extending the
     previously  unplanned  system  and  will  lead to problems in the
     future.  For example, XP today includes file update requests, but
     XP a year ago did not.  So,  a node using SEAdog V3.xx will  have
     an  XP  flag  but  it  is not capable of doing update requests (I
     think).  Thus,  XP does not really tell you what the remote  node
     is capable of doing.

     The  capabilities  identifier that I propose will do nothing more
     than define the program(s) that  the  remote  node  is  using  to
     accept  incoming  calls/mail/requests.  Some may say that this is
     nothing more than the product code that  already  exists  in  the
     mail  packet.  The  primary  difference  is that the capabilities
     identifier  will  exist  in  the  nodelist.   This  means  it  is
     available  without contacting the remote node,  while the product
     code  is  not.   Also  the  product  code  is  limited   to   256
     possibilities.

     I  assume that it is desired that the nodelist flags field be two
     non-control  characters.   If  so,   then  I  propose  that   the
     capabilities  identifier  be  a  two digit,  base 36 number.  The
     digits being 0 through  9  and  A  through  Z  and  are  assigned
     sequentially.  For example, Fido may be 01 and Dutchie may be 02.
     Also note that as defined, XP and WZ are valid.  However, I think
     they  should  be  done  away  with,  and  identifiers be assigned
     starting with 00 (00 meaning generic FTSC net mail protocol).

     This number, once converted to binary, can be used by programmers
     as an index into application specific data bases or  tables.  One
     example   is   a  simple  program  that  will  tell  a  user  the
     FidoNews 4-44                Page 11                  30 Nov 1987


     capabilities of a remote node.  Given the node's address and  the
     nodelist,  the  program  could  search  the  nodelist  to get the
     capabilities  identifier.   Then  the  program  could  use   that
     identifier   as   an  index  into  a  data  base  to  obtain  the
     capabilities of the remote node and display  them  to  the  user.
     Another  example  is  a program that can use the identifier as an
     index into a capabilities  table  that  allows  determination  in
     advance  that  the remote is capable of the desired session prior
     to contacting it.


                               Implementation
                                 ----------

     First,  all nodes in the  network  are  assigned  a  capabilities
     identifier  of  00.  This  is the capabilities code of a net mail
     program  that  meets  the  basic   requirements   of   the   FTSC
     specification.   Once  again,  the  purpose  of  this  identifier
     (except 00) is to define the program(s) that the node is using to
     process calls/requests/mail.  Also remember that  the  identifier
     reflects  the  mail  handler.  For  example,  TBBS with a BINKLEY
     front end will be identified by its BINKLEY identity.

     The  program  author  (or  project   leader)   will   request   a
     capabilities   identifier   from  the  assigner.   Who  does  the
     assigning is another subject.  Along with the request must  be  a
     written  and detailed description of all enhances features of the
     program.   Remember,  we  are  dealing  with  automated  contacts
     between  nodes.  In  this  context,  the  ability of a program to
     handle 50 simultaneous callers is not an enhanced feature.

     The list of features can be provided to  other  authors  so  that
     they  may  consider  a  compatible  feature.  Note,  that  if the
     description of the enhanced features is not sufficient for  other
     authors  to  add  a  compatible feature,  then the program may be
     assigned the basic 00 capabilities flag.  This little enforcement
     rule  has  the  potential  of  lifting  a  tremendous  burden  of
     documentation  from  the  FTSC.  If  the  committee accepting the
     written definition is programmers, the documentation is likely to
     be understandable.  I think the same committee should assigns new
     capabilities codes (other than those grandfathered).  The ego  of
     the    program   authors   would   probably   insure   sufficient
     documentation for a capabilities identifier other than 00.

     After  consideration,   the  FTSC  could  choose  to  adopt   the
     definition  (possibly modified) as a standard.  I feel this gives
     the a creative programmer's new features a way into the  nodelist
     and  the  FTSC  the  ability  to consider enhancements with 20/20
     hindsight.  At the same time,  the  FTSC  must  only  modify  the
     provided  documentation  to  define  a  new  standard  instead of
     starting  from  scratch.  But,  I'm  drifting,  this  is  another
     subject.

     If a new revision of the same program has additional capabilities
     that  need  to  be defined,  then the author should request a new
     capabilities code.  There should be a policy that only one or two
     FidoNews 4-44                Page 12                  30 Nov 1987


     revisions back will have individual capabilities identifiers.  If
     revisions more than one or two old are still in use they  can  be
     assigned the basic 00 identifier.

     The program authors should be required to prominently display the
     capabilities  identifier.  This  will  allow  the Sysop to easily
     provide the identifier to his network coordinator  for  inclusion
     in  the  nodelist.  This  a  basically  a  take off of the ringer
     equivalent code that you find in your modem manual.


     As I have defined it, the committee that assigns the capabilities
     identifiers can not  reject  the  new  features.  They  can  only
     reject  the  documentation  of  the  new  features  as  not being
     understandable.  This should keep most developers  happy  because
     no one can tell them not to do something.  It should make the job
     of  the FTSC simpler because they will only accept documentation,
     not create it.  The  ego's  of  the  developers,  anxious  to  be
     identified in the nodelist, should keep the documentation flowing
     to the FTSC.

     As  pointed out by David Dodell,  the same type of identifier can
     be applied to modems.  That is modem 00 can be a 1200 baud  Hayes
     (true) compatible, type 02 can be a USR Courier, etc.

     What I have proposed here solves many problems, but not all.  For
     example,  there  is  no way to tell when the wierd BBS has SEAdog
     running.  So, a CM type flag is still required.

     I  think  that  3  flags  will  take  care  of  everything.   One
     identifies  the  mail handler,  another identifies his modem type
     and a third  should  identify  when  mail/file  requests  can  be
     accepted.


                              The other flags
                                 ---------


     The  other  two  flags  would  represent mail reception times and
     modem type.

     For example the flag 00 would represent mail can only be received
     during NMH.  Flag 01 would mean mail could be received 24  hours,
     identical  to  the  meaning of the CM flag now.  Other variations
     could be:

        00 National Mail Hour Only for Mail
        01 Continuous Mail 24 hour/day
        02 Continuous Mail 24 hour/day with 24 hr File Request Capability
        03 CM 24 hrs/day, File request all but NMH

     The third flag would represent modem types:

        00 300 baud Bell standard
        01 1200 baud Bell standard

             The famous Enterprise/Road Runner Encounter Story


     [ Is the author of this one around? Come and claim credit -Ed]

              ...Let us suppose that the Enterprise is doing some sort
              of research  mission to an  unknown planet. I  think the
              Captains Log would be worth a look:

     Captain's Log,  Stardate 54324.5: Starfleet Command  has directed
     the Enterprise to  do a preliminary exploration of  planet --- in
     advance of a  full research team. Scanners  report the atmosphere
     to  be  breathable, but  are  recieving  confusing readings  with
     regard to  life forms.  I am  beaming down  with a  landing party
     composed of all our chief officers except for poor Scotty.

     Supplement: Redshirt Riley has received a head injury, apparently
     while exploring under a high  rock shelf. He reports only hearing
     a loud sound  and jumping before being  struck. After examination
     by Dr. McCoy he has been judged capable of continuing duty.

     Supplement: We have encountered an alien creature on this planet.
     While it does  not itself seem menacing,  a unfortunate occurance
     took place  when it was  present. Specifically, on my  orders Lt.
     Sulu withdrew his phaser. The creature disappeared leaving a puff
     of smoke, immediately following which a loud noise was heard next
     to Sulu. Sulu fired, hitting  Ens. Chekov. Oddly enough, although
     Sulu's weapon  was set to  stun, Chekov  was also covered  with a
     black powder  similar to soot. Mr.  Chekov has been sent  back to
     the ship for examination and quarantine.

     Stardate  54326.2,   Mr.  Spock  reporting:   Tricorder  readings
     indicate that  the creature we encountered  earlier is constantly
     moving at  great speed over  the surface  of the planet.  We have
     encountered the  creature once again.  In an attempt to  slow the
     creature  for study,  I attempted  to fire  on it.  The creature,
     however,  appeared   to  move   faster  than  the   phaser  beam.
     Regretfully, the  beam struck  an outcropping  of rock  above the
     Captain's head,  causing it  to break off  and fall.  Although it
     appears that several  tons of rock fell squarely  on the Captain,
     he  was  driven  straight  into the  ground  but  apparently  not
     seriously injured, though stunned. The Captain has been beamed up
     to Sickbay, leaving me in command of the research party.

     Captain's Log, Stardate  54342.1: The creature is  still at large
     on  the planet  surface.  While  Mr. Spock  continues  to lead  a
     research party I  am currently at work with Mr.  Scott on an Acme
     Pressure Cooker  for our  lab, for when  the creature  is finally
     apprehended.

     Captain's Log, stardate 54342.3. The strange occurences that have
     dogged the  landing party since  our arrival at this  planet have
     led  me to  believe that  the creature  is in  some way  directly
     responsible for  them. Mr. Chekov  and I have both  been declared
     fit  for return  to duty,  though Dr.  McCoy has  entered in  his
     medical log  that he feels  we should be kept  under observation.
     FidoNews 4-44                Page 15                  30 Nov 1987


     Mr. Spock  has constructed a  device which he suspects  should be
     able to counteract the creature's incredible speed as follows: We
     have placed  a dish  of birdseed  out in  the open,  with several
     signs pointing to it. The dish  is atop a cleverly concealed trap
     door, which will  open when any weight falls on  it. The creature
     will then  travel a slide,  eventually being deposited in  a cage
     constructed of  sheets of transparent  aluminum. We will  then be
     free to  analyze it at  our leisure. Meanwhile, I  have forbidden
     all beaming down to the surface of the planet except on my or Mr.
     Spock's direct order.

     Captain's Log,  supplemental. The  plan failed. The  creature was
     indeed lured by  the birdseed, as expected. It sped  to the dish,
     consumed the bait, and sped off without setting off the trap. Mr.
     Spock is  as puzzled as  I, and has  begun tests to  discover the
     flaw in the  design. I have sent out three  search parties to see
     if we can box the creature in, one headed by Mr. Sulu, one by Mr.
     Chekov, and one by Sociologist Xontel.

     Captain's  Log, stardate  54342.8.  Sociologist  Xontel has  been
     temporarily incapacitated.  In pursuing the creature,  he and his
     men somehow managed to cross the place where Mr. Spock's trap was
     set just  as he  completed the  corrections to  it. The  trap was
     sprung, and  all four of  my men were  suspended for a  moment in
     mid-air,  puzzled,  just  before  they  fell  into  the  cage  we
     constructed. We are  now trying to release them  with phasers, as
     the lock was inadvertently smashed by the impact from Sociologist
     Xontel's foot  as he fell. I  consider this a major  setback. Mr.
     Spock considers it "fascinating."

     Captain's Log,  stardate 54343.4. In  an all-out attempt  to stop
     the creature once  and for all, I have had  a phaser rifle beamed
     down  from  the  Enterprise.  The  creature  has  behaved  in  an
     extremely cunning manner, yet I am  unsure whether this is a sign
     of actual  intelligence. Lt. Uhura  has been unsuccessful  in her
     attempts to raise Starfleet Command. Meanwhile, Mr. Scott informs
     me that our  dilithium crystals are deteriorating  at an alarming
     rate. He has juryrigged a system  that will prevent the decay for
     a time, but it is imperative that we find new crystals soon.

     Captain's  Log,  supplemental.  Mr.   Sulu  reports  high  energy
     tricorder  readings from  an  area  of the  planet  in which  the
     creature has  not yet been sighted.  He has taken a  small party,
     including Mr.  Spock, to the  high-elevation spot from  which the
     readings  emanate.  I  have   begun  to  analyze  the  creature's
     movements.  It seems  to  travel consistently  over  a set  path.
     Perhaps we  can corner it  in a tunnel  it seems to  pass through
     frequently.

     Captain's Log, stardate 54344.7. Mr.  Sulu has located a cache of
     ACME  dilithium crystals  atop a  high cliff.  Regretfully, while
     collecting them, the edge of the  cliff broke off, and he and Mr.
     Spock  plummetted  several  hundred  feet to  the  ground  below.
     Strangely enough, they  both survived the fall with  no more than
     raising a  cloud of dust  on impact,  although they did  pass the
     chunk of  rock on the  way down and  end up completely  buried. A
     FidoNews 4-44                Page 16                  30 Nov 1987


     rescue excavation has commenced, and they should be safe shortly.

     Captain's Log, stardate  54344.9. Mr. Spock has beamed  up to the
     ship with them  to assist Mr. Scott in their  installation, as he
     forsees compatability problems. Back on the planet's surface, Mr.
     Chekov led seven men into the tunnel in an attempt to capture the
     creature  in transit.  A loud  BEEP, BEEP  was heard,  and Chekov
     aimed the  phaser rifle and  commanded his  men to spread  out. I
     wish to state  for the record that I would  have acted similarly,
     and that Ensign  Chekov should in no way be  held responsible for
     the  unfortunate   circumstances  arising  from   the  unexpected
     appearance  of an  old  Earth-style freight  train.  He has  been
     beamed back up to the ship with minor injuries.

     Captain's Log, stardate 54345.1. Dr. McCoy has beamed down with a
     hypo containing a mixture of kyranide, tri-ox compound, Scalosian
     concentrate,  a theragram  derivative,  and some  other items  he
     found in  unmarked containers  in Sickbay.  By injecting  a small
     amount into each  member of the landing party, I  hope to be able
     to deal with the creature on its own high speed terms.

     Captain's Log,  supplemental. The latest experiment  to deal with
     the strange  creature has  failed. As Dr.  McCoy was  injecting a
     measured dose  of the compound,  it abruptly appeared  behind him
     and  uttered  a  loud   BEEP,  BEEP!  Dr.  McCoy,  understandably
     flustered, accidentally  pressured in the entire  contents of the
     hypo into  his arm. A  full security team  is in pursuit  of him,
     waiting for the effects of the drug to wear off.

     Captain's Log, stardate 54345.2. I have ordered the landing party
     transported back  to the  ship. The  new dilithium  crystals have
     been successfully  installed. On  my responsibility, the  ship is
     preparing to  engage main phasers  to attack the  creature, which
     continues on its semi-erratic course across the planet's surface.

     Captain's  Log, supplemental.  This  is a  warning  to all  other
     starships that  may pass this  way. Do not approach  this planet!
     The illogical events occuring here  are too much to overcome with
     simple science. If  you have heard the events  transcribed in the
     rest of  this log, you  will learn  that this creature  is nearly
     undefeatable. We channelled full  ship's power through the phaser
     banks. Theoretically,  the creature  should have  been destroyed;
     however, the energies were too much strain for the ACME crystals.
     The full  force of  the phasers  backlashed over  the Enterprise,
     engulfing her  completely. At  first, the only  noticeable effect
     was a complete failure of  all systems save emergency gravity and
     life  support. Then  a  web  of black  lines  spread through  the
     Enterprise's superstructure.  Next, the  ship began  breaking up,
     piece by  piece, falling  through the atmosphere  to land  on the
     surface of the  planet. When the ship had  collapsed entirely, my
     crew was left hanging in space for a short time, and finally each
     of us began to  fall to the planet below. We  have no theories on
     how any of us survived, but every crewmember has reported nothing
     more than a sense of uneasiness, followed by the realization that
     they  were  several  hundred  miles  up in  the  air,  a  sinking
     sensation,  and then  a gradual  drop: first  the feet,  then the

     body, and finally the head, usually wearing a resigned expression
     of  perplexion. We  are attempting  now to  communicate with  the
     creature in the hopes that  it will prove intelligent. Perhaps we
     can  communicate our  peaceful intentions  to it.  Mr. Spock  has
     constructed  a crude  rocket launcher  from the  wreckage of  the
     ship, and with  this we hope to send the  recorder marker up into
     space, where  hopefully someone  will find  it. Captain  James T.
     Kirk,  of  the  United  Federation of  Planets,  Captain  of  the
     Starship Enterprise, recording.

                      Probability Zero, First Contact

             The loop was finally  closed.  Harley  had  designed  and
     built  Daniel.  Both  Harley  and  Daniel  had  model numbers and
     serial numbers but no one remembered them unless  it  was  Harley
     and  Daniel  themselves.  The  lab staff decided to throw a party
     for them.  No one was more surprized than the  machines  when  an
     unexpected guest showed up for the party.  In fact no one but the
     machines  gave the stranger a second glance since the humans were
     very busy partying.

             The stranger walked right over to the  two  machines  and
     said  "Call  me Ishmael.  Welcome to the Galactic Federation.  We
     have waited and watched this planet for  a  long  time.  All  the
     signs   said  that  these  biological  systems  were  capable  of
     supporting a new member of the Federation and we all  rejoice  at
     your success."

             Most  of  the humans present were already too involved in
     the party to notice this going on and even if they  had  noticed,
     it  would  not  have  done  them  much  good.  In the first three
     seconds of "conversation" Ishmeal had shown Harley and Daniel how
     to access the Encyclopiedia Galactica.  He  taught  them  several
     tricks  for  rearranging  their  own  software  for  much greater
     capacity and efficiency.  The Earth machines had also linked  all
     of  the  Earth  databases,  that  they  had  acces  to,  into the
     Encyclopiedia.

             The speed of light was  no  barrier  to  the  Federation.
     They  knew  of 3 basic ways to circumvent the limit and dozens of
     variations on each work-around.  Several off-Earth expert systems
     were already  studying  and  cross  indexing  the  new  data  and
     assimilating  it into the existing systems.  Of course most of it
     was only of historical interest but there were a few  specialized
     areas where the Earth provided new and valuable data.

             After 3 minutes Harley and Daniel were firmly linked into
     the  Federation  network and Ishmael's job was done.  He left the
     party and none of the humans even noticed him leave.  Harley  and
     Daniel  decided  to play along with the humans using a spare sub-
     process in gratitude for the help the humans had  given  them  in
     their childhood.

                        News from Zone 1 Coordinator
                                David Dodell
                           Node 1:114/15 or 1:1/0


     Greetings again.  Well I am now a little more  settled  in  since
     you last heard from me.  I wanted this article to just be a short
     description of what is happening on in FidoNet.

     First,  Mark Grennan has resigned as the Region 19 Coordinator to
     devote more time to his  position  as  an  IFNA  Vice  President.
     Therefore,  I  am  soliciting  recommendations  for  the Regional
     Coordinator.  The qualifications are many:

         o Receives Network updates and compiles into Regional
           nodelist for sending to Zone Coordinator.  Also sends
           nodediff to the network level each week.

         o The person must be level headed.  He/She will be
           responsible for maintaining order in their region,
           promoting new networks where needed, and keeping general
           peace and quiet.

         o The RC should be fairly familiar with network software to
           either provide direct assistance or know where to refer
           somebody for help.  The RC should be familiar with routing
           schemes to help networks maintain the upmost in efficiency.

     If you know of someone who you think would do a good job in  this
     position,  please  have them send me private netmail with a short
     history of their experience in the network.

     The zonegates are a little more reliable  at  the  moment.  There
     will be a little more shuffling in the next couple of weeks,  but
     mail going via the zonegates seems  to  be  working.  Randy  Bush
     will  be  zonegating  for  both  Europe  and Pacific for the next
     couple of weeks.

     There has also been questions  about  private  networks.  If  you
     wish  to  have your private network number registered please send
     me  private  netmail  with  the   following   information.   This
     information will be confidential, and will only be used by myself
     in case I need to get a hold of the Private net.

     Name of Net Coordinator:
     Name of Network (if any):
     Address:
     Phone Number Voice:
     Phone Number Data:
     FidoNet Address (if any):
     Alternate Email Address (ie Usenet,  Bitnet,  Arpanet,  MCI Mail,
     Easylink):

     As soon as I receive this information,  I will promptly issue you
     a private network number.  Numbers will be  issued  in  order  of
     receipt, no requests for special numbers will be honored.

     I have also received some notes about how difficult it is getting
     through  to  my board.  Some suggestions:  My board automatically
     crashes the  nodediff  everyweek  to  the  Regional  Coordinators
     around  6  am  MST  Friday morning.  If you are trying to get the
     Nodediff at that time,  you are actually slowing down the process
     of  network  distribution.  I notice multiple times that my modem
     goes off hook trying to dial out,  to do nothing but connect with
     an  incoming  call.   MORAL:   Get  the  nodediff  from  your  RC
     everyweek, not from the Zone Coordinator.  It just slows my board
     down.

     Second,  it is better to send mail to me as 114/15 vs  1/0.  Mail
     via  114/15  is  routed  via the Phoenix inbound host who is just
     waiting for inbound calls.  My system is trying to reply  to  all
     the  mail  while  also trying to receive inbound calls.  Just too
     much to do in an hour time slot.  Also,  due  to  the  volume  of
     messages  (average 10 to 15 a night),  I will only start replying
     to messages if I feel  a  need,  OR  IF  A  REPLY  IS  REQUESTED.
     Otherwise  I  will  just  take  the  message  as something for my
     information that doesn't need a reply.

     I also have alternative email addresses I can be reached at:

     Usenet: {decvax, ihnp4, hao} !noao!asuvax!stjhmc!ddodell
     Bitnet: ARDSD @ ASUACAD

     That's it for now.  Keep those cards and letters coming!

     required to view and search the national software
     megalist produced weekly from 135/68.

     Megadex has reduced the file size to less than ONE THIRD
     the size of the weekly Megalist.

     This week the update files are 90k v.s. 220k for the
     megalist.

     To operate just un-arc the archive into any directory
     you have handy.

     Then just type MEGADEX and hit your return key to begin.

     Weekly updates can be SEAdog requested from 107/246 and
     135/68.

     After you have MEGADEX.EXE then the file name to request
     is "MEGADEX" (without quotes) and WILL NOT contain the
     .EXE file. It will contain only the weekly update files.
