          | There isn't always something happening on Fidonet, but |
          | there's always something which isn't happening.  This  |
          | column is dedicated to the lost causes which make Fido |
          | what it isn't today.  Published semi-occasionally...   |

     It's not a good week for news.  It wasn't planned that way, but it's
     the way it turned out.  This was a week for your editor to take
     vacation from his job.  Though Fido activities were going to take a
     back seat for some personal time, there was lots of time left over
     for Fido.  It was going to be a week when I searched out burning
     issues to report, installed some software to help the operation
     along, and continue the facelift of the ol' Snooze.

     <sigh>  But Fidonews comes to you with the same old face, the
     software is still archived, and the only burning issues are in the
     FN_SYSOP area - where my moderation has drawn deep criticism both
     from those wh feel I haven't done enough and those who feel I've
     done too much.

     Actually, it may have been an excellent week for news - I just
     didn't get to see it from my perspective.  If any of you out there
     have seen anything I missed, please send it as an article to one of
     the addresses inside the box with the doggie... help out your old
     feeble editor :)

                              Early Thanksgiving

     Though we're over a month away from the holiday, I'd like to extend
     thanks to the following individuals...

     ... David Moufarrege for not making a _big_ deal about me
     misspelling his name last week.

     ... Jim Barchuk, Webmaster of fidonews.org, for tolerating me
     incorrectly referring to it as "fidonet.org."


     And for their contributions to the Fidonet Related Sites listed in
     this edition...

     ... Andrius Sytas for the Lithuanian web page address (2:47
     listing).

     ... Damian Walker for the update on the Region 25, Net 2502 listing.

     ... Frank Vest for the additional Region 19 listings (Nets
     124, 130, and 393.

     ... Joe Jared, who already takes care of the Fidonet Via Internet
     listing for agreeing to take care of the Fidonet Related Sites also.

     The college professor had just finished explaining an important
     research project to his class.  He emphasized that this paper was an
     absolute requirement for passing his class, and that there would be
     only two acceptable excuses for being late.  Those were a medically
     certifiable illness or a death in the student's immediate family.  A
     smart ass student in the back of the classroom waved his hand and
     spoke up.

     "But what about extreme sexual exhaustion, professor?"

     As you would expect, the class exploded in laughter.  When the
     students had finally settled down, the professor froze the young man
     with a glaring look.

     "Well," he responded, "I guess you'll just have to learn to write
     with your other hand."
