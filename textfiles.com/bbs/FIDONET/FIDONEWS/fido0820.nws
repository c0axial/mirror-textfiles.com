                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================


     Several articles failed to pass MAKENEWS this week. This week I
     decided it was high time I stopped spending two hours a week
     fixing articles that should have been right in the first place.
     If your submission isn't here, get a copy of ARTSPEC and fix it.

     There are some columns I have received as well but have not
     printed. This is because of previous policy of not reprinting
     material that is generally available in an Echomail conference,
     particularly if the material is either insulting or objectionable
     to large segments of the net. I'll be discussing this issue with
     the submitter in the next week.

     This week the Worldpol election story comes to a close with the
     announcement of the results. Well, it almost comes to a close.
     There's still the issue of the coordinators who didn't bother to
     represent their nets or regions in the vote. And the whining
     from certain folk who would like to have all the nonvoting
     nets counted as "YES" votes (yeah, the old IFNA mandate BS all
     over again!). Get out your Mylanta, Zeke, it's gonna be one of
     those years...

     So, now that Worldpol - in its present form - has failed, we are
     still left with the problem of correcting Policy4, either through
     repair or replacement. How do we get started on that process? And
     should nonvoting NC's be replaced before we get to the voting
     phase this time?

     Enough of all that. It's almost summer here. I'm having a great
     time. I hope you are too.

     Cheers,
     Vince

     Buenos Aires, May 12, 1991

                        HAPPY (?) BIRTHDAY, ZONE-4

     Today's the day. It is the celebration of years of hard work and
     growth. Today, the Latin American sysops celebrate the birthday
     of "the nicest zone" in FidoNet. :-)

     It was in May of 1987 when I started playing with Fido version
     10j. A BBS system initially called "Fido Central Buenos Aires"
     started operating then on my office's computer during the night.

     According to what the manual said, I wrote a message to Tom
     Jennings on "node 1" seeking admission to the network. I don't
     know now what I imagined FidoNet would be, but never thought
     there could be more than 100 or so systems on it.

     After a couple of days, I noticed that my computer was not able
     to get through to Tom Jennings', so the next day I arrived to the
     office early (at 6 am local time, Zone-1 mail hour) to supervise
     what was going on when my system tried to deliver the piece of
     net-mail.

     Sad surprise, I heard through the modem's speaker a recording
     saying "the number you have dialed has been disconnected". Next
     step was to try to find out the new number, and after about two
     or three months of asking "everyone" in CompuServe about it, a
     guy named Harvey Nehgila (yeah, he was the one!) on CompuServe
     gave me the number for the IFNA BBS in Saint Louis. I sent the
     message to them and was able to get through.

     Sometime later, Ken Kaplan called me home and we spoke a bit. It
     was very exciting to finally be in touch with FidoNet. I was
     finally instructed to get in touch with Ben Baker and he assigned
     me a strange node number in some net 1024. I still don't know
     what it was, but assume it must have been a point number or
     something.

     Later with time, I was directed to Region 18 which was the
     "closest" geographically to where I was located. Though due to
     the incredible distance we are talking about, a region in New
     York or Seattle wouldn't have made much difference for the case.
     Still, I was lucky to have Christopher Baker as RC. He did make a
     difference with his patience and assistance.

     It was not long until we were Net 368: FidoNet del Sur. A few
     nodes in Argentina, plus later a couple of systems in Venezuela
     that later went offline. I arranged it so each country was
     assigned a hub number. :-)

     FidoNews 8-20                Page 3                   20 May 1991


     When new systems joined us in different parts of Argentina, it
     was clear that we needed a wider range of possibilities: to be
     able to assign network numbers to each country and eventually
     part of a country, we needed something like a Region.

     I now don't remember how that part of the story continued, but we
     finally got to be Region 60 in Zone-1. It helped more than we
     thought it would. But the problem of having the Zonegate at about
     20,000 kilometers away, plus the ability to be able to organize
     FidoNet in the rest of Spanish and Portuguese-speaking Latin
     America prompted us to seek Zone status, that after a long time
     was granted to us by then IC David Dodell.

     Today, May 12, we celebrate 4 years of the genesis of FidoNet
     operations in Latin America and two years of the creation of
     Zone-4.

     We are in part happy and in part sad. On one hand, things are
     pretty much terrific within the zone. We have just been joined by
     Uruguay and Chile, while Mexico joined late last year,
     development of the network in Brazil has reached the Amazon, and
     Region 90 Argentina is well established and growing.

     We proudly exhibit our impeccable democratic state: all of the
     coordinators in the zone have been elected by the sysops. And we
     are currently choosing again the next Zone Coordinator having
     each sysop in the zone one vote.

     But we cannot hide our feeling of sadness when it regards to the
     network as a whole. For two years we feel oppressed and forced to
     tolerate a policy document we have invariably rejected through
     time. The rest of the world, with the exception of Europe, seems
     not to acknowledge our desire of not having to endure under
     Policy4.

     Zone-4 is full of life and delighted by being part of this
     international network. But having now resigned as Zone
     Coordinator and with the increasing discontent of the sysops in
     this zone feeling coerced by hostile coordinators from other
     Zones, I only hope that things change before FidoNet starts to
     loose its international characteristics.

                     Vote Result: Proposed New Policy
                     --------------------------------

     Matt Whelan
     International Coordinator

     Voting has closed on the proposed new FidoNet<tm> policy. The
     "WorldPol" proposal was ignored by a majority of eligible voters
     (non-votes outnumbered votes by 229 to 195), and rejected by a
     majority of the remainder.

     To be accepted as FidoNet policy, the proposal needed a 'Yes'
     from at least half of the votes cast. It received slightly less
     than 40 percent. 'No' votes accounted for nearly 50 percent, and
     the remainder were 'Abstain' votes -- effectively a vote against
     any change.

     Three FidoNet zones voted against the proposal, two voted for it,
     and one failed to vote.

     Final vote tally:

     Zone    YES     NO      ABSTAIN

     0       --       1      -- (IC, in accordance with world totals)

     WorldPol Kudos
     Harry Lee (1:321/202.1)

     I'd like to take this opportunity to give credit where credit is
     due with regard to the WorldPol election.

     First, a thanks to Pablo.  Even though I disagreed with his
     implementation, he deserves a great deal of appreciation for
     trying to do something about a Policy that clearly needs work.
     It matters not whether I agreed with his document, no matter what
     it said, it is nearly an impossible task to prepare and present
     to the contentious place that is FidoNet any set of rules.  He
     could have said the sky was blue, and still gotten serious
     argument from FidoNet.

     I'd also like to thank the coordinators of my region for at least
     caring enough to vote, and reminding me once again of the many
     reasons to love New England.  And a thanks to the other
     coordinators who deigned to vote on such an important issue.

     Thanks to the coordinators who voted against the Policy.
     Granted, it was a choice between two bad options, but you made
     the right choice.

     Finally, I'd like to give a rousing Bronx cheer to the vast
     majority of coordinators in Zone 1 for not giving a flying
     fatootie about FidoNet.  I've expressed this sentiment in at
     least one conference, and gotten some of the lamest excuses I've
     ever seen for their behaviour.  Those of you who didn't vote
     should be ashamed of yourselves.  Those of you who have actually
     tried to DEFEND that behaviour nauseate me, and really make me
     wonder about the future of the net.

     Oh, and to anyone who advocates the idea that Zone 1 not voting
     on WorldPol is some great conspiracy to defeat the proposition, a
     big thanks from all of us on planet Earth for keeping in touch
     with the Altairans and other space beings.

                           About CompuChurch (tm)

     CompuChurch (tm) was founded in 1988 by Rev. C.A.Jennings of
     Baton Rouge, Louisiana. First online May 14, 1988 on Comlink Data
     Systems, BR LA, CompuChurch was offering a new church experience
     to the world of personal computer telecommunications.

     The first minister ordained online occurred on May 30, 1988 (as
     of May, 1991 over 600 ministers have been ordained through this
     church).

     By August of 1988, CompuChurch had chartered the Batboard BBS, BR
     LA as a CompuChurch BBS.

     In January, 1989, our first free-standing system was provided for
     a time, allowing for the system development which occurred during
     the next several months.

     During that period, CompuChurch sought and obtained recognition
     from South Central Bell as a Church and as a Denomination.
     Additionally, the name of the church "CompuChurch" (tm) was
     registered by Rev. Jennings with the State of Louisiana, and
     acknowledged by the Secretary of State.

     Thanks to the efforts of the founders, and the generosity of many
     ministers in the Greater Baton Rouge area, and members of the
     Diocese of Baton Rouge ULC who operated the first chartered
     congregations, and the International Headquarters of the
     Universal Life Church, CompuChurch (tm) International
     Headquarters began operation on November 29, 1989, in conjunction
     with the Universal Life Church CompuChurch (tm) at (504) 927-4509

     CompuChurch (tm) International Headquarters distributes the
     ULC Ministers' Forum Echo and the CompuChurch Pastors' Echo both
     through The CompuChurch (tm) Network (CCN).  CompuChurch's
     Fidonet address is 1:3800/6.

     CompuChurch (tm) International Headquarters is the present
     organizational Hub of all networked chartered CompuChurches. and
     serves as Telecom Network Central for the Universal Life Church.
     Charters are available to any ministry without question of faith
     or dogma.  We do not go between you and your God. It does not
     matter to us about your particular religion, whether it be
     Protestant, Catholic, Nondenominational Christian, Jewish, Islam
     Buddhist, or whatever, you can charter a congregation to further
     your religious objectives and your personal ministry.  We have
     available many resources for one another by virtue of this
     structure.

     I'm reminded of a poem that My Grandfather used
     to recite at age 92 (he was a school teacher
     back in the days of the one room school.)

             The Pert Chicken

     There was once a pretty chicken;
     But his friends were very few,
     For he thought that there was nothing
     In the world but what he knew:
     So he always, in the farmyard,
     Had a very forward way,
     Telling all the hens and turkeys
     What they ought to do and say.
     "Mrs. Goose," he said, "I wonder
     That your goslings you should let
     Go out paddling in the water;
     It will kill them to get wet."

     "I wish, my old Aunt Dorking,"
     He began to her, one day,
     "That you wouldn't sit all summer
     In your nest upon the hay.
     Won't you come out to the meadow
     Where the grass with seeds is filled?"
     "If I should," said Mrs. Dorking,
     "Then my eggs would all get chilled."
     "No, they won't," replied the chicken,
     "And no matter if they do;
     Eggs are really good for nothing;
     What's an egg to me or you?"

     "What's an egg!" said Mrs. Dorking,
     "Can it be you do not know
     You yourself were in an eggshell
     Just one little month ago?
     And, if kind wings had not warmed you,
     You would not be out to-day,
     Telling hens, and geese, and turkeys,
     What they ought to do and say!"

     "To be very wise, and show it,
     Is a pleasant thing, not doubt;
     But, when young folks talk to old folks,
     They should know what they're about"

     Marian Douglas - from McGuffey's Third Eclectic Reader

          The Fort Worth Format Nodelist - A Proposal

     A number of discussions have taken place on tfe state of the
     nodelist.  With NODELIST.130 weighing in at 922,000 bytes
     (exactly) it's becoming obvious rather quickly that that the
     current St. Louis format nodelist is too large.  Some of the
     information conveyed in it, while interesting to humans, is
     completely redundant and unnecessary, while some vital portions
     of it could be shortened but left in.

     The purpose of this article is to define the Ft. Worth format
     nodelist.  The Ft. Worth format, named for the city of its origin
     (Fort Worth, Texas, USA), provides a great reduction in size of
     the current format, while still relaying the important
     information to the mailer.  Specific definitions, in the
     following sections, are followed by a detailed rationale for each
     change.

     The Ft. Worth format nodelist is based, in part, on the St. Louis
     format.  When the definition for the Ft. Worth style refers to
     the "current" format, something "now in use," or other equivilent
     phrases, it refers to the St. Louis format nodelist as defined in
     FTS-0005.  Thus, credit should be given to Ben Baker and Rick
     Moore for their excellent definition of the St. Louis "raw"
     nodelist format.

     This document is not final.  It's just something to "test the
     waters" to see how others feel.  Thus, some portions may be
     unclear to all but myself.  If that's the case please send
     netmail and I'll take a look.  This thing ain't ready for the
     FTSC yet . . . but maybe someday.  :-)

     Okay, here we go.  Let's start at the top.

      o   Each line in the nodelist will still be CR/LF terminated.
      o   CRC calculation and notation on the first line of the nodelist
              will remain the same.
      o   Each comment flag now in use will remain the same, with
              current comment formats remaining, as well.
      o   The nodelist must still be a pure ASCII file, with
              characters between 32 and 127 (space to tilde)
              allowed.
      o   The nodelist will be organized along the same lines we
              see today - that is, Zone/Region/Net/Hub/Node
              organization.

      o   Each Zone number must still be unique to a nodelist.
              Each Region and Net number must be unique to a Zone,
              and each node number must be unique to a Net.
      o   Each field in the nodelist is still divided by a comma (,)
              character, ASCII 44, hex 0x2C.  Spaces (ASCII 32, hex
              0x20) are not allowed except in comments.  Underscore
              (_) characters (ASCII 95, hex 0x5F) represent spaces in
              nodelist entries.
      o   Current maximum integers for Zone, Region, Net, and node
              numbers will apply.

        *   *   *   * Normal Nodelist Entries *   *   *   *   *   *

     For a normal public node a listing is as follows:

     num,sys_name,sysop,phone,bps,mtype,hrs,Uxflag

     The NUM field is the individual node address, unique to a
             net, assigned according to current policy.

     SYS_NAME is the system name, such as "Shadowdale_BBS". Maximum
             field length is 20 characters.

     SYSOP is the sysop name, such as "Mike_Wilson".  Maximum
             field length is 20 characters.

     PHONE is the phone number of a BBS, without extra dialing
             information such as an area code.  The number placed
             in this field is the same one you would dial if you
             were calling from right next door.  For example,
             "732-6157" is a valid value, while "1-817-732-6157"
             is not.  Because phone systems vary there is no field
             maximum.

     BPS is a two character representation of the maximum
             transmission rate of the node.  Valid values are:

                 03 - 300 bps         96 - 9600 bps
                 12 - 1200 bps        14 - 14,400 bps
                 24 - 2400 bps        19 - 19,200 bps

             Other values may be added as technology becomes
             available.

     MTYPE is a three or four character representation of modem type.
             Valid values include:

             MNP  - MNP error correction
             HST  - USRobotics HST
             V32  - CCITT V.32
             PEP  - Telebit Packet Ensamble Protocol
     FidoNews 8-20                Page 12                  20 May 1991


             H96  - Hayes V-Series
             V32B - CCITT V.32bis
             V42  - CCITT V.42
             V42B - CCITT V.42bis

             Redundant listings should be avoided.  For example,
             because HST implies MNP error correction no MNP flag
             should be present.  More than one flag may be present if
             the modem type warrants it.  For example, a USRobotics
             Dual Standard with V.42bis could be listed as:

             ...,96,HST,V32,V42B,...

     HRS is a two or nine character representation of the hours during
             which a node accepts mail.  If a node runs 24 hours this
             flag should be "CM".

             A nine character representation should be used for nodes
             that don't run the entire day but are up for part.  The
             format is:

             HHMM-hhmm

             "HH" is the 24-hour representation of the hour in which a
             node goes online to accept mail, translated to Greenwhich
             Mean Time (GMT).  Valid values are 00 - 23 (midnight to
             11:xx pm).

             "MM" is the two digit representation of the part of the
             hour in which the node goes online.  Valid values are
             00 - 59.

             "hh" is the 24-hour representation of the hour in which a
             node goes offline, and ceases to accept mail, translated
             to GMT.  Valid values are still 00 - 23.

             "mm" is the two digit representation of the part of the
             hour in which the node goes offline and ceases to accept
             mail.  Valid values are still 00 - 59.

             Thus, a node with this flag, listed as 0600-0900 is able
             to accept mail for three hours, from 06:00 to 09:00 GMT.
             A node listed as 1330-1800 is able to accept mail from
             1:30 pm to 6:00 pm GMT.

             If the flag is "CM" the node is able to accept mail 24
             hours a day.

             Absence of this flag indicates that a node only accepts
             mail during ZMH.  ZMH shuld not be indicated by this flag
             because all nodes are required to accept mail during ZMH.
     FidoNews 8-20                Page 13                  20 May 1991


             Only mail times different than ZMH should be noted in
             this field.

             This field is optional and may be left out.

     UXFLAG is an informational flag used for special comments.  The
             is the ultimate authority over what goes into the
             nodelist, and it is up to that person to decide upon
             valid values for this flag, as well as their meaning.
             Suggested values include:

             UNEC - Net Echomail Coordinator
             UREC - Region Echomail Coordinator
             UZEC - Zone Echomail Coordinator
             USDS - SDS Distribution point

             This field is optional and may be omitted.


       *   *   *   *  Pvt and Hub System Notation  *   *   *   *   *

     Two optional flags may be used at the beginning of a nodelist
     entry.  These flags, Pvt and Hub, retain their current meanings.

     If one of these flags is used it placed before the node number,
     with a comma (,) ending the field, like this:

     Hub,sys_name,sysop,phone,bps,mtype,Uxflag

     If the Pvt flag is used the PHONE, BPS, and MTYPE fields are left
     blank, like this:

     Pvt,sys_name,sysop,,,Uxflag

        *   *   *   *   *   * Host System Notation  *   *   *   *   *

     For net coordinators a different set of fields is used, preceeded
     by the Host keyword as follows:

     Host,net_num,net_name,area_admin,sysop,phone,dial_trans,
             bps,mtype,hrs,Uxflag

     Field names duplicated from the previous section remain the same
     except as noted below.

     NET_NUM is the number of the network, assigned according to
             current policy.  A valid value of this is "130".

     NET_NAME is the name of the network, created according to policy.
             A valid value of this might be "FTW_Gateway".  Maximum
             field length is 20 characters.

     FidoNews 8-20                Page 14                  20 May 1991


     AREA_ADMIN is the name of the region administered.  A value for
             this field might be "Ft_Worth_Metro".  Maximum field
             length is 20 characters.

     SYSOP is the person holding the NC position.  "Tom_Dobbins" is a
             valid value.

     DIAL_TRANS is a portion of a phone number added to the beginning
             of the PHONE field on a call outside your local net.
             An example of this would be "1-817-" for all nodes in Net
             130.  If you must dial something special to call long
             distance (for example, from New York City to Fort Worth)
             put that here.  This does not include 011- for
             international calls, nor does it include special
             sequences to get an "outside line" on office phones, or
             strange digit codes not used by a normal phone network.

       *   *   *   *  Region and Zone System Notation  *   *   *   *

     Each Region and Zone coordinator listing will be be preceeded by
     either keyword "Reg" or "Zon", as appropriate.

     The formats for Zone and Region Coordinators are as follows:

     Reg,reg_num,area_admin,sysop,fphone,bps,mtype,hrs,Uxflag
     Zon,zon_num,area_admin,sysop,fphone,bps,mtype,hrs,Uxflag

     Unless defined below, each flag retains the meanings given in the
     previous sections.

     "Reg" and "Zon" are unchanging flags, in the same manner as Pvt,
     Host, and Hub are unchanging flags.

     REG_NUM and ZONE_NUM are Region and Zone numbers, respectively.
             Each Region number must be unique to a Zone, and each
             Zone number must be unique to a nodelist.

     AREA_ADMIN means the area contained within that section of the
             nodelist, such as "North_America" (for Zone 1) or
             "TX.AR.OK.LA" (for Region 19).

     FPHONE is the full phone number of the system, including area
     code.  A valid value would be "1-817-732-6157" while "732-6157"
     would not.

       *   *   *  Zone Service and Regional Independants  *   *   *

     For Zone service nodes (1:1/x, 2:2/x, etc.) and regional
     independant nodes (1:19/x, 2:23/x, etc.) one last format is used.

     num,sys_name,sysop,fphone,bps,mtype,hrs,Uxflag

     The only difference between this flag and a normal (networked)
     node is that there is a full phone number, not a partial one.

       *   *   *   *   *   *  NODEDIFFs  *   *   *   *   *   *   *

     The current system of NODEDIFF production using the A, C, and D
     commands will not change.

     Here's the part you've been waiting for, but the one that I
     dread.  Here are my reasons for the suggested changes.

     There's no preceeding comma before a node number because there's
     no need for one.  It's just an extra byte to transmist and keep
     around.  If it doesn't need to be there, zap it.  If it's not a
     keyword it's a node number, and there's no need to create a field
     to tell it that.

     Fields are limited to 20 characters because that encourages
     sysops and coordinators comments succinct.  It discourages extra
     information that doesn't need to be there.  For example,
     "The_Shadowdale_BBS" and "Shadowdale" in the SYS_NAME field
     convey exactly the same information but one is shorter, thus
     taking less disk space.

     Sysop names are included in the nodelist to make sure that
     someone is responsable for what goes on at a node, so that it's
     not just an address with nobody on the other end.  Some may argue
     that if you don't know who the sysop is you don't need to be
     sending mail there (and thus you don't need to list the name in
     the nodelist), but it must be clear who is responsable for the
     actions of a node.  Including the name seems the reasonable way
     to go.  Since it's limited to 20 bytes per entry anyway, that's
     not too hefty.  Drop the first name if necessary.

     Phone numbers have been shortened because it just carries
     redundant information.  There are about 50 nodes in Net 130 and
     all carry 1-817- before their real phone numbers, which, on my
     system, gets deleted anyway.  In net 124 there are over 100
     nodes, and each one had 1-214- in front of the number.  Assuming
     125 nodes that's 750 bytes of information that can be cut to 6
     bytes.  Do that for every net in FidoNet and we might just have a
     good size cut.

     BPS is cut to two characters because the trailing zeros just
     aren't needed.  Every listing has those two zeros, so it can be
     universally understood that they're there.  Zap them and, at
     10,000 nodes that's 20k saved.  Less disk space, less
     transmission time, less money.

     FidoNews 8-20                Page 16                  20 May 1991


     Mtype is included because some mailers allow the capability to
     modify how a calling modem will react to the called modem's
     carrier.  For example, if you have a Dual Standard and you call
     another Dual Standard you can choose if you want an HST or V.32
     connection.  Also, some modems require special commands be sent
     to be able to connect with modems that offer different
     communications protocols, and identifying the type of modem
     present is a good way to facilitate this.

     Hours online allow someone to send mail outside of ZMH to a node
     that isn't CM.  If the node is online 24 hours CM is used to
     indicate this.

     Uxflags allow the conveyance of additional information to sysops
     and (maybe) mailers, such as who is the local NEC or SDS
     distributor.  Elections have been conducted using this flag and
     it could be helpful.

     Dropping the location field in the current nodelist eliminates
     much of the redundant information, as does dropping area codes.
     Does anybody really care what city 1:130/28 is in, so long as the
     mail gets through?  If it's that important you can send a netmail
     message rather than have it sit on everybody's system.

     Dropping the mailer capability flag is also a space saving idea.
     Does ANY mailer really use that flag (you know, XA, XX, XR, XW,
     etc.)?  Every mailer I've seen determines what mail protocol to
     use at session startup.  Since FTS-0001 compliance is required
     anyway, everyone supports it, and it's the minimum fallback
     protocol - so everyone can talk to everyone.  No need to list it
     in the nodelist.

     I have retained the current net/node system (Z:NNN/nnn.pt)
     because all current mailer software supports some version of it.
     Thus, mailers won't have to be completely rewritten to use a new
     addressing scheme.  Besides, would you remember that Shadowdale,
     sysop Mike Wilson, is node 1-817-732-6157 if node numbers were
     phone numbers?  Everything would have to be rewritten.  With this
     change relatively minor modifications would have to be made to
     nodelist compilers and mailers.

     Most of the changes suggested here are designed to save space.
     To see if it works, let's use the first ten Zone 1 service nodes
     as a test (all Zonegates and a couple others).   Here's the
     current listing, as of NODELIST.130.

     I've cut off the ends of each some of the listings to comply with
     FidoNews specs.  Now let's look at this listing under my system.

     The last flag for 1:1/31 has been left on because it's there and
     is a special flag.  Only one SYS_NAME had to be cut - that of
     1:1/30, and only two characters.  Thus, twenty characters is
     plenty for both sysop names (just look at Vince's listing) and
     system names.  And the entire line of all 11 entries fits in less
     than 65 characters.  The savings are obvious.

     Please consider this proposal.  If you'd like to suggest changes
     you may netmail me at any address listed at the beginning of this
     article.  Of not, well, okay.  :-)  It's not final, I'm not done,
     it's not an FSC yet.  Take a look and see what you think.

     Special thanks to the unwitting contributors on the DFW echo who
     helped me decide how to do things.

     Doris Zagorski
     FidoNet - 1:379/23

          Have you ever had a good helpful hint or maybe you had
     wished someone had given YOU a helpful hint?  Well, we are
     starting an echo just for that!  It could be hints from getting
     those white rings off your furniture or maybe just a tip about
     what you could do with all those plastic grocery bags that keep
     piling up.
          This would be a way to pass a "Thoughtful Idea Plus S'more"
     to all of us who need them.  Many of us, at times, have exactly
     what we need right under our noses, to solve some of those
     household disasters...  We just don't know that they are there.
     Often we buy products that say they will take out grease, grime,
     pen-marks etc... only to find out that we could have taken them
     out with the can of hairspray that was in our bathroom or
     something equally "innocent".
          Just the other day I heard a suggestion about those new
     handled detergent boxes.  These boxes can be made into storage
     units for VCR tapes.  A little contact paper to cover it up and
     you have yourself a VCR Tape carrier.  The box that would have
     found its way to the nearest dump... NOW has a new purpose.
          The main idea of this echo is to share the tips, tricks and
     thoughts about solving all those little "mishaps" we all face
     from time to time in our homes.  We all have them and just as
     important, we all need them! :-)
          "TIPS" is being made available on the backbone, but until it
     is available in your area, you are more than welcome to ask for
     it directly and we'll be glad to feed it to you (1:379/23).  For
     those who wish to save a little time (faster modem, Crashable,
     etc...), you may get it from 1:379/1...

     Backbone Schmackbone --

     The Telco's have a backbone network.  Used to be, the phone
     companies used the voice channels themselves to carry
     signalling protocol.  You would start off the process by taking
     the phone off hook.  Your local switch looked at the number you
     dialed, allocated a channel from a trunk headed that-a-way, and
     sent the digits and now billing information along the channel,
     and each successive channel in the path to the destination.

     The good thing about this method is that when an end to end
     connection is finally established, the total path had been
     tested with your signalling data.  The bad thing was that it
     cost too much to use the TRUNKS ( ie. voice grade channels )
     for signalling.


     Competition Breeds Innovation --

     A backbone control network, a data switching network, was built
     to provide cheaper signalling and as well, smarter signalling.
     In the old way, switch A connected to B, B to C, C to D and then
     the response D to C to B to A and wait for the human at D to
     pick up or answer.

     In the new way, the backbone system talks to all the switches,
     and just tells the switches what to do from a centralized 'big
     picture' point of view.  In our example, A and D generate
     rings, and BC aren't involved until D picks up the phone.  The
     backbone knows ABCXYD because it knows an alternate route.  The
     backbone knows ABCE because call forwarding has been set.  The
     backbone may even know your credit card number.


     SemIantical --

     Naturally, we in Fidonet use 'backbone' referring to our
     trunking system, but our signalling system is FANTASTIC.  Our
     control over usage is cost based but still entirely driven at
     the whim of the message creator.  That's not bad.  But we are
     not saturated with mail to the point where we need to either
     cut back service, or establish more TRUNKS.  Telcos buy TRUNKS
     and lease them back to the users for a profit, as needed, under
     public scrutiny.

     Fidonet takes all volunteers and we spread the cost out.
     Remember the part about signalling ?  We designate the path a
     packet will follow IN ADVANCE.  Most of us don't run multiple
     lines so alternate routing is done manually when needed.  And
     95% of our mail is destined to several hundred end points for
     each packet :  a broadcast of data.  The 'Eavesdrop Effect'.

     While speaking of signalling, did you even notice how long it
     takes to figure out who called, and what protocol to use.  This
     is becoming a big time waster in large local nets where there
     is no cost, hence immediate calling with smaller packet sizes,
     making the time to setup half the call time.  If you run
     Binkley, my CFL utility will tell you these values for your
     system and connects ( 124/6120 CFL44.ZIP ).

     So, we wait for saturation.  I'm running about 71% idle, 21%
     off hook and 8% off line processing.  How you doing ?


     Echo Schmecko --

     Image a room full of people MILDLY interested in the same
     things.  You enter and pass by folks in groups and you stop to
     listen in one group where you know someone.  The topic jumps
     from point to point with each comment or story.  Eventually you
     will have discussed 10 things.  Probably four of those things
     were also mentioned in EVERY one of the other groups.

     You drift to another group.  You discuss some new things and
     REPEAT some things heard in other groups.  You get different
     opinions.  You gain perspective.  All those good social
     interaction things.

     When this 'party' process is laid into the format of an e-mail
     conference, it must retain the GROUP MEMBERS, TIME,
     SENDER/RECEIVERS and BODY TEXT.  The loss of any of these
     aspects in the replay causes disruption of the process.  We
     disrupt almost universally in echomail because of the
     'Eavesdrop Effect', ie. we honk up the group members by
     allowing everyone to see everybody all at once ( and because of
     the packet bundling nature of our software ).  The receivers
     are not readily known as you might have with eye contact.  And
     there's no way to filter out the 'Buttinsky' or 'One-liner' or
     'Boorish Slug' Effects either.

     In live interaction, with no chair or lead speaker, probably 12
     is the maximum.  I'd guess 80% of all exchanges in echomail are
     between two people, and 15% are three people.  I participate
     happily is several conferences where the count of participants
     is not over 20, but those entering messages is not more than 8
     at any given time.  I barely participate in one so-called MEGA
     conference, the BINKLEY echo, and only to read about the latest
     crap Vince is dropping into the mailer I happen to use. [Vince's
     note: we don't call it CRAP, we call it NEW FEATURES ;-]

     Joggraphy --

     What's all this talk about Joggraphy ?  Jogging is good
     exercise, costs little and doesn't harm anybody.  If you want
     to take pictures that's your business, but remember joggers
     have rights too, and ...  oh, NEVERMIND.

     All you folks who live for echomail will soon conclude that I'm
     crazy as Emily but I'm telling everyone anyway.  Electronic mail
     is on the whole, a fine way to communicate with someone you
     know, but echomail and other public access 'everybody sees
     everybody else' type forums is not social interaction.  It's
     like having everybody watch TV and calling that our educational
     system.  Nothing is going to replace direct face to face
     contact.

     And that's why I think Geography is important to Fidonet.
     Geographic boundaries, and particularly NETS, align folks into
     groups which are physically close to each other, and best able
     to get together.  In my net, we have a monthly Pizza Party.  In
     our Region, we have a yearly Lake Party.  You probably have
     these kinds of meetings in your parts of the world.  That's the
     really good part.

     I'm happy to report that the 4th Annual Poor Man's Fidocon and
     Lake Party is going to be held by John Summers at his very own,
     exclusive lake-side resort home.  Complete information to
     follow.
