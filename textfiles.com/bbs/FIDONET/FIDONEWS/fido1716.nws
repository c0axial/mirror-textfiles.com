                            At What Age Maturity?
                                  Doug Myers

     The Halls of Fidonet are quiet tonight.  The Fido Elders have
     retired to their Chambers and have not issued Pronouncements for a
     long time now.  The Grunt Sysops are peacefully tilling their fields
     and don't seem in revolt at the moment.  Indeed, the ElfLords seem
     to have dropped their agenda of atrocities.  The mail movers
     haven't shot any stars out of the constellation; the splintering
     into more backbones seems arrested.

     All in all, it's a slow news day...

     But over in the Z1C echo, Stewart Hornsberger comes to our rescue,
     fending off several of Fido's more "experienced" sysops in an
     argument over maturity.  Though I haven't examined all the messages
     related to the string, it appears that Stewart revealed his age of
     19 on his web page, and was subsequently called down for
     "immaturity" in some of his subsequent posting.

     Whether the charge is accurate or not I couldn't tell you, as I
     didn't read the original messages.  But I'm familiar with Stewart's
     posting in other conversations and know that he's given to
     passionate and confrontational exchanges which some associate with
     immaturity.  Mr. Hornsberger mainly makes the point that maturity
     cannot be determined by age alone, and cites events in his life
     which would contribute to maturity at an early age, such as passing
     newspapers to purchase his first computers rather than being born
     with a keyboard in his lap.

     So at what age is one sufficiently mature to post in a Fidonet echo?
     The debate will undoubtedly continue to rage in the Z1C conference
     as I don't expect to resolve it here.  However, I expect to make a
     few observations which may fuel the conversation... or, more likely,
     be disregarded as the ramblings of an editor trying to make
     something of a slow news day.

     Nineteen isn't such a bad age.  Though the age seems far away to me
     at the age of 53, I seem to recall that I had most of my language
     skills developed by that age and had a good general idea of how
     people interacted.  While I've got to admit that subsequent life
     experience has modified my approach to things, I believe that at the
     age of 19 I was sufficiently mature to enter conversations as an
     adult.  But then, I wasn't online then... I was nineteen in the
     sixties and hardly anyone was online then!  Especially, I wasn't
     interacting in a hobby which has somewhat passed its prime and whose
     participants tend to middle age rather than youth.

     To Stewart I can only offer this observation:  if you post in a
     confrontational style, folks are going to look at you at the age of
     nineteen and say that the style is obviously a sign of immaturity.
     FIDONEWS 17-16               Page 2                   17 Apr 2000


     If *I*, at the age of 52, post in that same confrontational style,
     folks are going to conclude that it's obviously the sign of some
     mid-life crisis.  If Warren Bonner posts in that same
     confrontational style, folks will conclude that it's a sign of
     dotage.

     Posting passionate messages arguing your maturity probably won't
     change folks perceptions... it's kinda like holding your breath
     until they see you as mature.

     To the more experienced participants in the discussion, I'll offer
     this observation:  Like it or not, Stewart is the future of Fidonet.
     Any plan which will accomplish growth in Fido is going to have to
     involve younger people - the middle aged folks are already here :)

     Imagine... the future of Fido is in the hands of a sysop who goes by
     the handle of Black Death.  Kinda scary, eh?

                             FOTI's new website!
                                 Bobby Queen

     Folks as some of you may already know Simon Slater  has stepped down
     as the webmaster of the FOTI (FidoNet on the Internet) site.  I made
     an offer to take over the site and Simon agreed.  The site's already
     be relocated to a new site at http://foti.webjump.com.  I've already
     fixed all of the mail links etc & I'm now going to start on the list
     of all the echomail echos.   The previous sites listing has links to
     any websites set up for the echos and email links to the moderators.
     I am going to get my email links from the elist echo list but if you
     have a webpage setup for your echo then you can send that info to me
     at foti@shelby.net.   Any other suggestions can be sent to me at the
     same address.

     Quotes:
     Ah, yes, "divorce," from the Latin word meaning "to rip out a man's
     genitals through his wallet." -Robin Williams

     Women complain about premenstrual syndrome, but I think of it as the
     only time of the month that I can be myself. -Roseanne

     Women need a reason to have sex. Men just need a place. -Billy
     Crystal

     I just broke up with someone and the last thing she said to me was,
     'You'll never find anyone like me again!'   I'm thinking, "I  should
     hope not! If I don't want you, why would I want someone like you?"
     -Larry Miller

     If you want to say it with flowers, a single rose says: "I'm cheap!"
     -Delta Burke

     You can say any foolish thing to a dog, and the dog will give you
     this look that says, "My God, you're right! I never would've thought
     of that!" - Dave Barry

     According to a new survey, women say they feel more comfortable
     undressing in front of men than they do undressing in front of other
     women. They say that women are too judgmental, where, of course, men
     are just grateful. - Jay Leno

     I am not the boss of my house. I don't  know when I lost it. I don't
     know if I ever had it. But I have seen the boss's job and I do not
     want it. - Bill Cosby

     In the last couple of weeks I have seen the ads for the Wonder Bra.
     Is that really a problem in this country? Men not paying enough
     attention to women's breasts?- Jay Leno

                                Stupid People
                              Thanks to Roy Reed

     Stupid people should have to wear signs that just say, "I'm Stupid".
     That way you wouldn't rely on them, would you? You wouldn't ask them
     anything. It would be like, "Excuse me...oops, never mind. I didn't
     see your sign."

     It's like before my wife and I moved. Our house was full of boxes
     and there was a U-Haul truck in our driveway. My friend comes over
     and says "Hey, you moving?" "Nope. We just pack our stuff up once or
     twice a week to see how many boxes it takes. Here's your sign."

     A couple of months ago I went fishing with a buddy of mine, we
     pulled his boat into the dock, I lifted up this big 'ol stringer of
     bass and this idiot on the dock goes, "Hey, y'all catch all them
     fish?" "Nope - Talked 'em into giving up. Here's your sign."

     I was watching one of those animal shows on the Discovery Channel.
     There was a guy inventing a shark bite suit. And there's only one
     way to test it. "Alright Jimmy, you got that shark suit on, it looks
     good...  They want you to jump into this pool of sharks, and you
     tell us if it hurts when they bite you." "Well, all right, but hold
     my sign.  I don't wanna lose it."

     Last time I had a flat tire, I pulled my truck into one of those
     side-of-the-road gas stations. The attendant walks out, looks at my
     truck, looks at me, and I SWEAR he said, "Tire go flat?" I couldn't
     resist. Said, "Nope.  I was driving around and those other three
     just swelled right up on me.  Here's your sign."

     We were trying to sell our car about a year ago. A guy came over to
     the house and drove the car around for about 45 minutes. We get back
     to the house, he gets out of the car, reaches down and grabs the
     exhaust pipe, then says, "Darn that's hot!" See? If he'd been
     wearing his sign, I could have stopped him.

     I learned to drive an 18 wheeler in my days of adventure. Wouldn't
     ya know I misjudged the height of a bridge. The truck got stuck and
     I couldn't get it out no matter how I tried. I radioed in for help
     and eventually a local cop shows up to take the report. He went
     through his basic questioning..ok..no problem. I thought sure he was
     clear of needing a sign...until he asked "So..is your truck stuck?"
     I couldn't help myself! I looked at him, looked back at the rig and
     then back to him and said "no I'm delivering' a bridge...here's your
     sign."

     a @ preceding an individual's name implies a virtual email
     address. The email is translated as follows
     firstlast@osirusoft.com will automatically route to the
     appropriate individual's email.  Anyone in this list will
     also receive routed notice of this feature.  In my case, it
     would still be joejared@osirusoft.com, but you get the idea.

     Also, as information is provided to me, I will be adding a
     latency field to each node, which is defined as the maximum
     time between when the message is received, and when it is
     sent on to other nodes, or available to be sent onward,
     defined in minutes. A latency of ! implies that there is an
     immediate response, and an attempt to deliver immediately
