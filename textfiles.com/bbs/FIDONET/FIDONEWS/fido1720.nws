                          Much Ado about Nodelisting
                                  Doug Myers

     For the last three weeks, the title "Fight-O-Net" seems best
     represented by the goings on in Z1C, the echo for sysops to contact
     the Zone 1 Coordinator.  Dallas Hinton, Region 17 Coordinator, has
     been having trouble (apparently for much longer than the three weeks
     the issue has been active in Z1C) getting his region's nodelist
     segments incorporated into the zone 1 nodelist.  Frustrated by what
     he perceived as a lack of response from David Moufarrege, Z1C,
     Dallas took his case to the Z1C echo.  His words were construed by
     many as calling for David's head:


     ----- extracted from Z1C echomail by Dallas -----

     If life (family, work, whatever) is getting in the way for a long
     period, it's up to you which has priority but if it isn't FidoNet
     please step down so someone else can help us. FidoNet has enough
     problems without an absent ZC.

     ---------------


     Almost immediately, Dallas was criticized - both for "attacking"
     David and for "covering up" in the past when he posted for an ill
     Bob Satti, then Z1C.  Dallas own political ambitions were
     questioned.


     ----- extracted from Z1C echomail by John Souvestre -----

     I find it interesting that when Bob Satti was in a similar position,
     for over a year, you felt otherwise.  Indeed, you covered up for
     him.  Now that a political adversary holds the office you change
     your tune.  An interesting double standard.

     Please note:  I'm not saying that I disagree with you now.  In fact,
     just the opposite.  I disagreed with you when you were covering for
     Bob.  This hardly puts you in a position to lead the charge against
     David, however, unless you still lust for the Z1C position yourself.

     ---------------


     Of course, there's been more posted than that which I quoted, but I
     just wanted to illustrate the flavor of the controversy in order to
     comment on the questions raised so far.

     1.  Is David Moufarrege about to be removed as Z1C?

     FIDONEWS 17-20               Page 2                   15 May 2000


     I doubt it.  What we're following in the Z1C conference is a bunch
     of concerned Fidonet members trying to resolve a technical problem.
     For some reason, we choose to address each other in an apocalyptic
     tone whenever Fido isn't working properly... but this is nothing out
     of the ordinary.  Perhaps the gruff talk is the only way we can get
     each other's attention.


     2.  Does Dallas "lust" for the Z1C position.

     "Lust" is too strong a term here, implying (to me) that attaining
     the Z1C position is such a strong priority that any means would be
     justified.  Dallas has certainly expressed interest in the position
     in the past, as did several of us, but his campaign in the last
     election was waged cleanly and reasonably, showing none of the
     obsession which I would associate with lust.

     Further, I doubt that Dallas would be so artless as to attempt to
     convert a nodelist guffaw into a takeover attempt.  Were Dallas the
     master of political intrigue which his detractors credit him, I'm
     sure he could set up something much better.  To me, it seems that he
     just wants to get his nodelist segment processed on a regular basis.


     3.  Is Dallas to be ostracized for "covering" for Bob Satti in the
     past?

     Though his actions then don't qualify as "openness at all costs," the
     offense to Fidonet is more imagined than real.  In the final
     analysis, there's no rule against one sysop typing for another, nor
     was there any demonstrable harm generated by this tactic.  The issue
     is likely to whither once again with no resolution like it has the
     last umpteen times it's been discussed.


     4.  Is the technical issue resolved yet?

     Yes and no.  It's resolved in that region 17's current nodelist
     segment is processed and incorporated in the current zone 1
     nodelist.  It's unresolved in that the original difficulty, despite
     much speculation, is still unknown.  David Moufarrege contributes
     that, after Dallas' complaint, he found the unprocessed nodelist
     segment in his inbound... but with no clue as to why it didn't
     process.  He added it manually with no processing difficulties, so
     there's no hint as to the original difficulty.  Several individuals
     have pointed out technical problems with Mike Moon's alternate
     nodelist processor, NLMAKE (which I infer Dallas is using), but it's
     unclear whether these problems were a factor in the nodelist
     processing failure.  Most likely, this will only be resolved in the
     future as David monitors the nodelist processing and communicates
     with Dallas.


     The conversation in Z1C is, of course, much more complex than the
     simple overview I've presented here.  Two other developments are of
     note and may be subject to further comment in Fidonews:
     FIDONEWS 17-20               Page 3                   15 May 2000


     - Ross Cassell declares the days of the "Good Old Boys" network are
       dead.

     - Bob Satti makes one of the longest posts I've ever seen by him,
       discussing actions he took as Z1C to ensure reliable nodelist
       processing, and offering help to David Moufarrege.

     This was written in the Reg12 echo by Darrell, and I actually did
     get his permission to publish it in Fidonews.

     ---------------

     Hello All!

     Every once in a while we get a phone call that we aren't ready for,
     didn't expect, and it floors us. I got one of those today.

     Bob Davidson has died suddenly.

     Bob was, of course, the NC of Net 163, and to all the sysops of Net
     163 go my deepest condolences.

     Was there anyone that understood friendship as well as Bob? Was
     there anyone that was more helpful to sysops than Bob? Those of you
     than knew Bob know how friendly and helpful he was. I have received
     dozens of netmails and emails from Bob over the last few months, all
     of them helpful hints, tips, suggestions, and notes of
     encouragement. This R12C will miss him greatly. When I think of Bob
     I'm reminded of the Chinese proverb ...

     If you want happiness for an hour -- take a nap
     If you want happiness for a day -- go fishing
     If you want happiness for a year -- inherit a fortune
     If you want happiness for a lifetime -- help someone else

     Bob was a very happy and wise man. I recall a conversation with him
     where we were sharing the aches and pains of work. You see, Bob used
     to work in construction (as I do) until serious back problems forced
     him to persue another line of work. He chose the computer field and
     became a very competant MCSE and Network Administrator. Smart guy?
     You bet. And yet, he never forgot about us, the little guys, the
     much-maligned Fidonet sysops that he proudly called his friends. Bob
     was loved and appreciated.

     But Bob is no longer with us. He touched us, some of us quite
     deeply, and we will never forget him. All that we have, in the end,
     are the people we touched. Not money, not fame, not strength, not
     thoughts. Just the people we touch.

     Darrell

     FWIW,  there was an attempt a while back to take fido technology and
     commercialize operations.  That was called BIZynet.  I was in this
     from near the beginning,  though it was started by one Chris Gunn,
     formerly of San Diego though I believe he's now in New Mexico.  I
     got to the point of being an RC in this organization,  and in fact
     _still_ carry the 70:5/0 address as one of my AKA's,  though only
     because I haven't gotten around to taking it out yet.

     I have no idea what Chris is up to these days,  the last I heard it
     was something to do with "moderating newsgroups",  which always
     struck me as too much like trying to herd cats to be of much
     interest.

     This got started after I "moderated" Chris and others a number of
     times about how fido,  being a hobbyist network,  was not a place to
     actually _do_ business,  particularly with people posting in the
     FIDONEWS 17-20               Page 6                   15 May 2000


     BUSINESS echo.  He figured that maybe it was time to start a network
     where it was...

     Unfortunately for this sort of thing to work it needed to attain a
     certain cricital mass in terms of the number of technically
     competent sysops to run the thing.  And that didn't happen.  What we
     got instead were people with a strong entrepreneurial streak,  who
     needed a lot of hand-holding on the technical side,  a bit more than
     we could cope with,  and it never really took off.

     I've also participated in a few other nets with "business"
     orientations,  but for one reason or another they never went
     anywhere either.  If somebody wants to get something like this going
     and it's not going to take absurd up-front expenditures of cash,
     I'd sure like to hear from you.

                               Ol'WDB's Column
                            This week, Maine Logic
                             wdbonner@pacbell.net
                                  (A funny)

      A Texan, a Canadian, and a guy from Maine are out riding horses.
     The Texan pulls out an expensive bottle of whiskey, takes a shot,
     then another, and suddenly throws the bottle in the air, pulls out
     his gun and shoots the bottle in midair.

     The Canadian looks at him and says,"What are you doing? That was a
     perfectly good bottle of whiskey.  The Texan says, "In Texas,
     there's plenty of whiskey and bottles are cheap."

     A while later, not to be outdone, the Canadian pulls out a bottle of
     champagne, takes a few sips, throws the bottle in the air, pulls out
     his gun and shoots it in mid air also.

     The guy from Maine can't believe this and says, "What did you do
     that  for? That was an expensive bottle of Champagne". The Canadian
     says "in  Canada there's plenty of Champagne and bottles are
     cheap".

     So a awhile later the guy from Maine pulls out a bottle of  beer. He
     opens it,takes a sip, then another sip, then chugs the rest.  He
     then puts the bottle back in his saddlebag, pulls out his gun, turns
     around and shoots the Canadian.

     The Texan, shocked says, "Why did you do that?!?"  The guy from
     Maine says,"Well in Maine, we have plenty of Canadians, but bottles
     are worth a nickel apeice."

     *No malace intended, was amused that the Texan was not the "goat"
     FOR A CHANGE...  Perhaps I'm the "BUTT" for it.  Haha

     FIDONEWS 17-20               Page 9                   15 May 2000


     created by one of the R19 members (graciously donated) and added the
     "dog with diskette". for the most part, this is a low graphics page.
     It should load fast and is designed for information rather than
     "flash". There are contacts for those interested in joining or just
     wishing to "get in touch". On the other pages, you will find more
     information and links.

     Two of the things I like best is the information "blurb" on each
     page and the "Glossary of Terms". Each page has a short text
     describing a part of Fidonet related to that page. The "Glossary" is
     available from each page as well and contains definitions of some of
     the terms used in the pages and in Fidonet in general.

     On a personal note, I've always wanted a Fidonet site that helped
     new visitors to understand "what the heck we are talking about". :)
     I think the Glossary is a good start on that and would like any new
     definition that someone might offer. Also, feel free to link to that
     page and/or other pages at this site. Pass the links around and help
     get some interest in Fidonet going.

     Till next time,

     a @ preceding an individual's name implies a virtual email
     address. The email is translated as follows
     firstlast@osirusoft.com will automatically route to the
     appropriate individual's email.  Anyone in this list will
     also receive routed notice of this feature.  In my case, it
     would still be joejared@osirusoft.com, but you get the idea.

     Also, as information is provided to me, I will be adding a
     latency field to each node, which is defined as the maximum
     time between when the message is received, and when it is
     sent on to other nodes, or available to be sent onward,
     defined in minutes. A latency of ! implies that there is an
     immediate response, and an attempt to deliver immediately
