    I am including a letter more than 200 years old this week.
I received it in Email after a discussion in an echo.

    I was struck by how familiar it was.  Mail.  Some things
change very slowly.

NOTE: MODR8TR is a new echo for moderators, started when it looked
      like William Degnan was going to take MODERATOR out of the
      Planet Connect distribution. As it turns out, MODERATOR
FidoNews 12-46                 Page:  3                    13 Nov 1995

      remains on the satellite, so there are now two echos. Note
      that the new MODS echo has nothing to do with moderators.

NOTE: WARNING is a clone of WARNINGS with different moderators.
      WARNINGS was removed from the backbone because the listed
      moderator was not active in the echo and the backbone was
      getting many complaints.

From: Scott A. McClare
To: Donald Tees
Subject: That Coleridge Poem

 Hello Donald!

Remember me mentioning a S. T. Coleridge poem about geometry?  I
finally managed to look it up:

A Mathematical Problem

     If Pegasus will let thee only ride him,
     Spurning my clumsy efforts to o'erstride him,
FidoNews 12-46                 Page:  4                    13 Nov 1995

     Some fresh expedient the Muse will try,
     And walk on stilts, although she cannot fly.

                         TO THE REV. GEORGE COLERIDGE

DEAR BROTHER,

     I   have   often   been  surprised  that  Mathematics,  the
quintessence of Truth, should have found admirers so few and  so
languid.   Frequent  consideration  and  minute scrutiny have at
length unravelled the cause; viz. that though Reason is feasted,
Imagination  is  starved;  whilst  Reason  is luxuriating in its
proper Paradise, Imagination is wearily travelling on  a  dreary
desert.   To assist Reason by the stimulus of Imagination is the
design of the following production. In the execution of it  much
may   be   objectionable.    The   verse  (particularly  in  the
introduction  of  the  ode)  may  be  accused  of  unwarrantable
liberties,  but  they  are liberties equally homogeneal with the
exactness of Mathematical  disquisition,  and  the  boldness  of
Pendaric  daring.   I  have  three strong champions to defend me
against the attacks of Criticism: the Novelty,  the  Difficulty,
and  the  Utility of the work.  I may justly plume myself that I
first have drawn the nymph Mathesis from the visionary caves  of
abstracted  idea,  and  caused  her  to unite with Harmony.  The
first-born of this Union I now present to you;  with  interested
motives  indeed  -  as  I  expect  to receive in return the more
valuable offspring of your Muse. Thine ever, S.T.C.

[Christ's Hospital], March 31, 1791.

This is now - this was erst,
Proposition the first - and Problem the first.

I

On a given finite line
Which must in no way incline;
     To describe an equi -
     - lateral Tri -
     - A, N, G, L, E.
       Now let A. B.
     Be the given line
Which must no way incline;
     The great Mathematician
     Makes this Requisition,
       That we ascribe an Equi -
       - Lateral Tri -
       - angle on it:
Aid us Reason - aid us, Wit!

II

  From the centre A. at the distance A. B.
     Describe the circle B. C. D.
  At the distance B. A. from B. the centre
FidoNews 12-46                 Page:  5                    13 Nov 1995

The round A. C. E. to describe boldly venture.
       (Third postulate see.)
     And from the point C.
  In which the circles make a pother
  Cutting and slashing one another,
       Bid the straight lines a journeying go.
  C. A. C. B. those lines will show.
     To the points, which by A. B. are reckon'd,
     And postulate the second
  For Authority ye know.
          A. B. C.
       Triumphant shall be
     An Equilateral Triangle,
Not Peter Pindar carp, nor Zoilus can wrangle.

III

     Because the point A. is the centre
       Of the circular B. C. D.
     And because the point B. is the centre
       Of the circular A. C. E.
     A. C. to A. B. and B. C. to B. A.
  Harmoniously equal for ever must stay;
       Then C. A. and B. C.
     Both extend the kind hand
       To the basis, A. B.
  Unambitiously join'd in Equality's Band.
But to the same powers, when two powers are equal,
       My mind forbodes the sequel;
  My mind does some celestial impulse teach,
       And equalizes each to each.
  Thus C. A. with B. C. strikes the same sure alliance,
  That C. A. and B. C. had with A. B. before;
          And in mutual affiance
            None attempting to soar
               Above another,
            The unanimous three
          C. A. and B. C. and A. B.
       All are equal, each to his brother,
          Preserving the balance of power so true:
     Ah! the like would the proud Autocratix do!
       At taxes impending not Britain would tremble,
       Nor Prussia struggle her fear to dissemble;
          Nor the Mah'met-sprung Wight
            The great Mussulman
            Would stain his Divan
With Urine the soft-flowing daughter of Fright.

IV

But rein your stallion in, too daring Nine!
Should Empires bloat the scientific line?
Or with dishevvel'd hair all madly do ye run
For transport that your task is done?
  For done it is - the cause is tried!
FidoNews 12-46                 Page:  6                    13 Nov 1995

  And Proposition, gentle Maid,
Who soothly ask'd stern Demonstration's aid,
     Has proved her right, and A. B. C.
          Of Angles three
       Is shown to be of equal side;
And now our weary steed to rest in fine,
'Tis rais'd upon A. B. the straight, the given line.

(1791)

Whew . . . anyone got a compass?

Fidonet in the Future
Is There a Will Among Sysops and Developers to Keep Fidonet Improving?
Brad Crockett 1:340/201

I certainly hope so.  There is a lot of excellent work going into
Fidonet just maintaining it, and the quality of the network is
outstanding.  The text based design works to our advantage as well.

It's troubling, though, when the only discussions these days seem to be
about political stuff.  And it's worries me that no one ever seems to
get any credit for what Fidonet is.  Certainly there is a lot of work
being done to maintain the nodelist and echos, and publish the Snooze.
I apologize that I am not completely aware of what else goes on in the
background (I'm a Newbie), but certainly I have my NEC to thank as well.
Heavens, I find myself quite busy just organizing my own little BBS,
never mind organizing feeds and such.  I wouldn't want their jobs!

This hard work that goes into the net has a payback for everyone.
Compared to the commercial service 'conferences' and the Usenet
newsgroups, Fidonet has far better quality of participation.  This
results in a very high 'signal to noise ratio'.  In fact, I would say
that Fido echos have the best content of any of the networks.  I believe
that this is because the participants are mostly sysops - and they have
invested more into the system than the users of the other networks.

It's a good thing that Fido's focus is on messaging.  With the
Internet's disctracting Webs and Home Pages and graphics viewers, it's
no wonder people are already complaining about all of the 'static'.  And
it's no wonder that Internet performance slows to a crawl again shortly
after a site's bandwidth is upgraded.

So I think that we all deserve a pat on the back for managing growth the
way we have.  And for contributing to a system that has excellent
staying power.
