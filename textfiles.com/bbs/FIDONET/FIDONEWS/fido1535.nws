     Greetings,

     Why is it that the echo, ECHOLIST, is used for announcing echo's not
     remotely related to FidoNet?  Seen quite a few of FamilyNet passing
     in it.  Does anyone care to enlighten me please?

     Happy reading.

                Survivor's Guide to the SUPER-BITCH conference
                Douglas Myers    1:270/720    doug@mdtnbbs.com

     Bitches have been with us always, but they are no longer considered
     chattel.  Not only have they emancipated themselves over the last
     few centuries, but now they are finding, from within their ranks,
     those who epitomize the essence of all that is bitchin'.  These
     Super-Bitches have their own conference on Fido now!

     We've been able to hold off the bitches in the late nineteenth and
     early twentieth century with promises of equality.  But with the
     advent of the Super-Bitches, such a gambit no longer works.  No
     self-respecting Super-Bitch will settle for mere equality.

     Of course, us guys _could_ survive by avoiding the bitches
     altogether.  And now that we've had our little laugh, lets get into a
     practical technique.  Write this down and memorize it:  Survival
     amoungst the Super-Bitches is basically a matter of being henpecked.
     Since I have over a quarter-century devoted to the practical
     application of this technique, I'd like to discuss it briefly (if
     it's okay with the Super-Bitches, that is)...

     Be yourself when you enter the echo.  While it may be tempting to
     keep your attitude and behavior under control at first, you still
     have a quota of faults to maintain.  If you don't display them, the
     Super-Bitches will assign sufficient to bring you up to snuff.  So
     just be yourself and, above all, don't ask permission for it - a
     Super-Bitch will just figure you're trying to limit her right to
     bitch about it later.

     Of course, you'll find yourself in confrontation anyway - did you
     expect less from _this_ conference?  But you _can_ survive if you
     keep these techniques in mind:

             1.  Don't panic.  You're not expected to understand the
                 arguement, and it will change frequently anyway.

             2.  Don't rely on the echo rules as a guideline.  Don't even
                 bother reading them.  You're only expected to know one
                 rule - the one that was just made up for you.

             3.  Memorize the phrase "Yes, Dear" and utter it in a
                 resigned tone each time the Super-Bitch pauses.  She's
                 checking to make sure that you're not paying attention.

     You may be tempted to argue back, but keep in mind that 50,000
     bitches can't be wrong.  There aren't actually that many connected
     to the echo, of course, but do _you_ want to be the one to bring
     that up?

                       ANNOUNCING THE SUPER-BITCH ECHO
                          - stolen from Ruth Argust

     The text below was extracted from announcements on several echos.
     When I suggested to Ruth that an announcement in Fidonews would be
     appropriate, she responded in true super-bitch tradition.  Her
     response, to "stuff it" was interpreted by this reporter as
     permission to print her material.

                      --------------------------------

     For the time of your life, request the SUPER-BITCH echo from your
     uplink. We will tease, bitch at and generally make nuisances of
     ourselves by harrassing the *C's and *EC's. The ElfLords won't want
     to miss it either since you will want to know what we are up to :)

     This is an non-partisan announcement made in the general public
     interest of promotion of fairness to Super-Bitches everywhere.

     These are the Echo Rules for the Echo:

     (Please remember that, in keeping with the spirit of this conference,
     the echo rules are also tongue in cheek echo rules. If you would like
     to insert your tongue somewhere else, please contact a moderator via
     the echo.)

                      THE SUPER-BITCH CONFERENCE RULES

     This is the FidoNet International Echomail conference SUPER-BITCH.
     This echo is for the uncivilized and immature discussion of issues
     affecting FidoNet. The Super-Bitches will usually treat each other
     with respect, and attack all others.

     Official language:  Flaming, with tongue in cheek.

     These rules will be posted whenever we feel like it. If the
     participants cannot look up the ELRUL file, then they deserve
     appropriate treatment at the hands of the Super-Bitches.

     Feed cuts will be ordered liberally, particularly when any of the
     Super-Bitches has PMS, but also whenever they feel pissed off with
     their SO or the family dog or the neighbour.

                                Echo rules:

      - Stick with the topic of the Echo.  Or not.
      - Leave MODERATING to the MODERATORS.  You might piss us off
        otherwise.
      - The Super-Bitches will respond to all offtopic posts - including
        "Tests".
      - Quote only that which ties to your reply--stop QUOTAHOLISM, unless
     FIDONEWS 15-35               Page 5                   31 Aug 1998


        you feel like quoting.
      - Feel free to request routine FidoNet info here, instead of asking
        your local NC.  We'll provide you with the RIGHT answers.
      - The posting of "test" msgs is considered annoying behavior. But
        then, so is any post. Super-Bitches reserve the right to flame
        anyone who posts or even lurks.
      - Use this conference for corresponding to the moderators; discuss
        echo policy in the open echo.
      - Correction of the spelling, grammar, or style of other people's
        messages is reserved to the Super-Bitches.
      - If you wish to chastise someone, make sure the Super-Bitches will
        agree the person needs chastisement. Then go ahead.
      - These rules were bashed off quickly, and are not expected to be
        definitive or even suitable.  They will need to be discussed to
        death and argued over for at least five years before we agree on
        any changes.
                      --------------------------------
                           The Moderators are:
                             Lesley-Dee Dylan
                             Lynn Gipson
                             Andrea Santos
                             and Ruth Argust
