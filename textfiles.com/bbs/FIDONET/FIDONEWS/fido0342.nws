               WINNER OF ADVENTURE GAME CONTEST ANNOUNCED
               ------------------------------------------

         Douglas Asherman, of Oakland, California, has won the
     first Official GAGS Game Contest, sponsored by Mark J. Welch,
     author of the Generic Adventure Game System*. Asherman's game
     is called "Alice," and is patterned after the character
     invented by Lewis Carroll in the book "Alice in Wonderland."

         The contest, which began May 24 and ended September 30,
     1986, offered a $100 prize to the author of the best text
     adventure game written using GAGS, which is an adventure-game
     development system MS-DOS computers. The winning game will
     also be included with each copy of GAGS distributed from
     October 1986 to October 1987. GAGS is distributed as
     Shareware, so users can copy it without charge, paying $15 for
     registration if they enjoy it.

         Asherman's game allows a player to play the role of Alice
     as she goes through the Looking-Glass, and to meet many of the
     same characters described in Carroll's book. Asherman also
     adds some humorous 20th-century perspective to the 19th-
     century character.

         The contest generated nationwide publicity and interest,
     Welch said. "The main purpose of the contest was to encourage
     people to share the games they'd written using GAGS," Welch
     said. "A lot of people had started games, spending quite a few
     hours on them, but stopped before they'd really finished them,
     or before they'd really made them playable."

         As one result of the contest publicity, Welch learned that
     several computer bulletin boards have made GAGS available for
     callers to play on-line.

         "I was surprised at first, since anyone can download GAGS
     and play it on any MS-DOS computer, even systems that aren't
     IBM-compatible," Welch said. "Then I realized that other
     computer owners can't use it. If you've got a Commodore or an
     Apple, the only way you can play GAGS right now is to call a
     bulletin board. I hope some of these BBSs will allow callers
     to play 'Alice' now, since it's much more enjoyable than the
     sample game I've been distributing with GAGS."

         Welch said he has not yet decided whether to sponsor a
     second game contest.

         Although GAGS currently works only on computers that use
     the MS-DOS operating system (including the IBM PC and
     Fidonews                     Page 3                    3 Nov 1986


     compatibles as well as non-compatibles), Welch hopes to
     release a version for the Apple Macintosh this winter. "I'm
     just waiting for Borland to release its Turbo Pascal compiler
     for the Macintosh," Welch said.

         Welch sells GAGS on disk for $10. Registration is $15
     more. Registered users can also buy the complete GAGS source
     code for $25, Welch said, if they wish to add features to the
     program.

          Initializing data, please wait (should take 1 minute)...



          You've woken up to a fine, fine morning.  The sun shines,
     the birds sing, and you feel wonderful.  Your cat, Dinah,
     greets you at your bedroom door. You see that her kittens
     follow her lovingly, and you feel that nothing could be finer
     than to be greeted by Dinah in the morning.
        There is, however, a spectre on the horizon.  Today is the
     day for your mathematics lesson.  Of course, you could plead
     illness, but that would ruin your opportunity to go out and
     enjoy the rest of the day.  You get dressed and go downstairs,
     ruminating on how you could possibly skip your mathematics
     lesson and still be able to enjoy the rest of the day.
        "There must be some solution," you think, "some way to
     elude my tutor and go out to play." If you lived far in the
     future instead of in A.D. 1865, we would say that you suffered
     from a malady called "female math anxiety."  But as you are
     only a little girl, and as you DO live in 1865, we can only
     say that you haven't studied.
        Ah, well . . . . perhaps there is some way to avoid your
     imminent academic embarrassment . . .perhaps.  Perhaps it's
     somewhere in the house.

        You are standing on the west side of the fireplace in the
     drawing room of your house.  The chairs here are made of
     nicely polished wood, and the mantle over the hearth is very
     well kept up.  Everything, in fact, is exactly as it should
     be.  The sun is shining, birds are singing, and you feel that
     today of all days, nothing could possibly go wrong.

     << Drawing Room >>
         There is a ball of yarn lying on the floor here

     What Now? EXAMINE YARN

     The ball of yarn seems to be incredibly tangled.  In fact, it
     seems to have gotten tangled into the rug itself!

     << Drawing Room >>
         There is a ball of yarn lying on the floor here

     What Now? PULL YARN

     The yarn untangles easily....perhaps a bit too easily.

     You are standing in an alcove.  To the south is the west side
     of the drawing room.  Your father says that standing in this
     alcove puts you exactly north of the west side of the
     fireplace.  You think you understand what he means, but have
     never really taken the time to ask.

     << Alcove >>
         Your nanny is standing here.

     What Now? SOUTH

     << Drawing Room >>
         There is a ball of yarn lying on the floor here

     What Now? EAST

     You are standing on the east side of the fireplace in the
     drawing room of your house. The sun is shining in through all
     of the windows, even through the little stained-glass window
     in the southern door. Once again, you feel that everything is
     as it should be. You can't decide, however, whether to go out
     and play or to prepare for your Mathematics lessons.

     << Drawing Room >>
         There is a lovely Swiss clock on the mantelpiece

     What Now? EXAMINE CLOCK

     The clock, although obviously a fine piece of craftsmanship,
     seems to be telling the wrong time.

     You are sitting down in front of the fireplace in the drawing
     room of your house.  You feel as if you've fallen.  "But" you
     think "that is ridiculous. One must have been up somewhere to
     have fallen down, and as I've not been up I can't possibly
     have fallen down."  You think that this is good logic, but
     still make a mental note to ask you mathematics tutor, Mr.
     Dodgson, about it. Suddenly you notice that the southern door
     (the one with the lovely little stained-glass window in it) is
     open.

           There is a small dagger here. (In the umbrella)
           There is a small silver key here. (In the umbrella)

     What Now? TAKE ALL

     The umbrella won't budge.
     You are now carrying the dagger.
     You are now carrying the key.

     << Drawing Room >>
         There is an old umbrella here

     What Now? SOUTH

     You are in the garden.  The sunlight out here lends a radiance
     to all of the flowers and plants.  Even the forest on both
     sides of the garden is..... "Wait," you think. "There never
     used to be a forest on the east and west sides of the garden.
     In fact I'm quite sure that the Finchley-Smythes lived to the
     east of us, and the Hatton-Carrolls to the west.  Hmmm..."
     Stranger still is the fact that there is a wall to the south
     where you could've sworn there was a path down to the river.

     << Garden >>
         There is a musical instrument case here.
         There is an unclimbable wall at the south end of the garden

     What Now?  . . . . . .

        Hello there fellow SysOps and Users!  I'll bet most of you
     spend well over $100.00 per month in long distance calls.  If you
     are a SysOp like me, you send twice or even three times that much
     on long distance.  Well, get this flash.....


     $100.00 per month gets you...


                     U N L I M I T E D    C A L L S

                      U N L I M I T E D    T I M E

                  U N L I M I T E D    A N Y W H E R E*
                         (* in the United States)


     Watts lines have been used primarily by large corporations for
     cheaper rates on volume long distance calls.

     This is a program that takes average telephone users and combines
     their usage to obtain volume rates.

     WHY -

        The divestiture of ATT has given other companies the
     opportunity to compete with ATT for long distance phone service.
     Many companies have done so.  The company that I am dealing with
     offers unrestricted, (in the United States, except Alaska), long
     distance phone service for $100.00 per month.  Most of the other
     long distance companies are asking you to choose them or ATT.
     Our service is saying keep your present long distance carrier and
     also have this, now you have two long distance choices.  For
     heavy long distance users (like we SysOps) this is inexpensive
     because we use state of the art equipment, access low cost lines,
     and maximize usage.  This is a supplement, not an alternative.


        I am sure you are asking about long distance rates within your
     state.  Well, presently our service offers INTRA-STATE long
     distance for the following states;

     Arizona               Colorado              Delaware
     Fidonews                     Page 8                    3 Nov 1986


     Dist. of Columbia     Hawaii                Idaho
     Michigan              Montana               New Hampshire
     North Dakota          Oklahoma              Pennsylvania
     Rhode Island          South Dakota          Tennessee
     Texas                 Utah                  Virginia

     ....With many more on the way!  While you wait for your state, you
     can still call anywhere outside your state (unlimited).


     ACCESS -

        Upon receipt of your application your personal access code
     will be issued.  To access our service you only need dial an 800
     number then your personal access code.  It is very important that
     you keep your access code personal!


     BILLING

        Our service does not send bills.  When you become a customer,
     you may (if you wish) sign up for the Check-O-matic plan.  Your
     $100.00 monthly long distance phone bill will automatically be
     deducted from your account and you will not have to worry about
     forgetting the payment and losing the service.  Check-O-matic
     deductions are made the 15th of each month. Otherwise payment may
     be made by the 24th of the preceeding month by mail.


     What a deal, huh?  There is more.....

        Our service is a new company that will not spend money on
     advertising.  They use the most effective and least expensive
     form of advertising.  "WORD OF MOUTH" (OR COMPUTER TERMINAL!).
     For people who know friends or relatives who would be interested
     in their long distance phone rates, our service offers and
     incentive program that enables participants to profit from
     commissions.  THERE IS NO COST FOR PARTICIPATING IN THE MARKETING
     PLAN.


     HOW -

        For each new customer who purchases our service, you will
     receive a $25.00 commission each month that customer
     participates.  For example, if you sign up four people for our
     phone service, you would receive 4 x $25.00 ($100.00), per month,
     during their participation.  You would still have to pay your own
     $100.00 bill for your long distance service but you would receive
     a seperate commission from us for $100.00.  IN EFFECT, your long
     distance calls would be at NO COST.

        We have designed a marketing plan so that you can earn even
     MORE commissions.  If the first four people you sell the service
     also sell the service to others, you receive a $5.00 commission
     for each additional participant each month they continue the
     Fidonews                     Page 9                    3 Nov 1986


     service.  This $5.00 bonus plan pays down through 5 levels*

     *Where payment through more than a specified number of levels is
     prohibited by state law, payment will be made only to the levels
     permitted by such law.


     EXAMPLE -

             You sell       Mike      $25.00       Level 1

             Mike sells     Tom       $ 5.00             2

             Tom sells      Ken       $ 5.00             3

             Ken sells      Vick      $ 5.00             4

             Vick sells     Bill      $ 5.00             5

             Bill sells     Richard   $ 5.00             6


     You may offer this program to as many people as you choose.


     You are saying "What's the catch?"  There isn't one!!  And even
     if you don't sell it to anyone, $100.00 per month long distance
     is still the best deal around!


     If you are interested, send a check or money order for $4.95 made
     out to;

          Well,   hello again from the sunny???? south.  I have been busy
     this week collecting programs that were either send by fidomail, U.S.
     Postal Service, or even handed to me on disk. Most if not all of
     these are utilities for Fido and a scant few for SEADog.  I am
     sorting thru them right now and attempting to see what they all do.

          I am presently testing the file FD (FrontDoor) written by
     Joaquim Homrighausen and Peter Stewart of 501/4609.  These gentlemen
     have done something I have been trying to accomplish for a long time.
     They have managed to train the doggie to respond to command and wake
     up on cue.

          Although FD was written for the Hayes modems and EXACT clones it
     seems to work nicely on my U.S. Robotics and so far has done
     everything I have asked of it. There are a number of different things
     that you can set up in the program, chief among these is the ability
     to LOCK OUT or disregard carriers from any of the modem speeds (ie
     300/1200/2400  1200/75). You can selectively lock out these speeds
     either one or two or three or (if you are REAL MEAN) ALL FOUR !

     I have a small problem here in that most of my 300 bps callers are
     young kids still trying to play war games and they think I will allow
     them to just roam thru the system and do as they wish. Using FD I
     showed them that they still have a long way to go.

     FrontDoor has the following command line switches that will OVERRIDE
     the installed features:

     FD/1 or /2   Tells which com port to use
     /I           install switch, used to set up defaults
     /?           what else, HELP !!!!!
     /L           log calls to a disk file by date,time,baud rate, etc.
     /N            causes the program to NOT initialize the modem
     /K           uses constant speed to modem (use if you have a BUFFER
                  in the modem only)
     /Q           silent run  doesn't beep if connecting
     /Bn          initialize the com port to baud rate  (3=300 1=1200
                  2=2400)
     /Xn          The GOODIE !   EXCLUDE this baud rate
     /Sn          connect code for split speed operation (ie 1200/75)
                  Hayes has no standard for this one yet. The program
                  defaults to 8.


          The only problem I see with this program is that it must turn
     Fidonews                     Page 11                   3 Nov 1986


     control of the system over to Fido 10 minutes before a scheduled
     event and thus you must add an external event after every event in
     order to RESTART the RUNBBS.BAT. I am thinking that maybe SEADog does
     this also so this should not be too great a problem to most users. I
     run all my mailslots one right after the other so I just added 1
     external event after the last mail slot to reboot the system and thus
     return control to FD.

          FD has a few bugs in it from what the authors say but I would
     say that for a first attempt they have done a good job and should
     keep up the work.

          They do request that any system that intends to use FD send them
     a FidoMail and there is a shareware request in the documentation. I
     fully intend to send the $ to them my only question is HOW much is
     $20 US in SWEDISH KRONA ! and as a note to those who try to call
     them.....be forewarned that the SWEDISH PEOPLE as far as I can tell
     speak English, but the phone system connected me to a FRENCH ARMY
     OFFICER on the first call and to someones home phone on the second
     call. I tried to contact the author voice at a number he gave me but
     due to the time differential and the fact that I was trying to call
     on a weekend didn't help, all I got was the place he worked (I
     think). Their phone system is a little weak in the data-line end of
     it.

          Anyway, that's it for this week, remember to keep those files
     coming (I still have about 30 MEG left to fill and to date I only
     have about 2.9 meg of Fido utilities and another 3 MEG of FidoNews. I
     also have a user here (MIKE GORDON) who is in the process of
     downloading the FidoNews files and converting them to Commodore
     Format ASCII and then ARCING them using a program for the Commodore
     called ARC134. We are making these files available as fast as Mike
     can work. He would like to mention that we can send these files to
     you on disk in either Commodore format along with the program to ARC
     and UN-ARC them or we can send them in IBM format (360k DSDD). If you
     would like us to send them to you all you need to do is send 5 disks
     in an envelope with a self-addresses disk mailer big enough to hold
     them and with enough postage on it to get them back to you. We will
     copy them over to disk for you and mail them out within 24-48 hrs of
     receipt.

          BY THE WAY......DID YOU NOTICE FNEWS340.ARC was MISSING a few
     PAGES.......SO DID I !!!!!!

                            +=================+

                     Part 2: Review of Bobsterm Pro 128


        What is your idea of the "ideal"  terminal?  Whatever  it  is,
     Bobsterm  Pro  128  from  Progressive Peripherals & Software will
     probably satisfy it.  Simply stick the key in  joystick  port  2,
     put the Bobsterm disk in the drive, turn the computer on, and you
     will  be  welcomed  into a brand new world of telecommunications.
     Folks, this terminal can do anything except wash the dishes!

        Since  this  program  has   SUCH   an   extensive   array   of
     capabilities, I am going to let the manual's table of contents be
     my  guide.  Because of the volume,  I'll be sticking to "just the
     facts" as I go through, with comments later.  Here we go:

        If you can connect  your  modem  to  the  128,  Bobsterm  will
     support  it.  If  any  of  the  built-in  operating  modes  isn't
     compatible,  you simply define your own  mode.  Modems  supported
     are:  Commodore 1650, 1660, 1670;  Westridge, Master Modem; Total
     Telecommunications; Mitey-Mo; HES I & II;  and Hayes Smartmodem +
     compatibles.

        Up  and down loading can be accomplished in a variety of ways,
     including:  Straight ASCII/PETSCII/Binary;  seq line with prompt;
     XON/XOFF-DC1/DC2 Capture;  Punter Protocol;  Xmodem protocol with
     optional CRC plus ability to dump  to  CP/M  disks;  Entire  disk
     (Track/Sector).  All transfers can be from/to disk or buffer, and
     all may be viewed as they happen.

        Speaking of the buffer,  here's some data on it:  60000 bytes;
     Fill from keyboard, disk,  CP/M,  or from byte#;  dump to screen,
     printer,  disk,  CP/M;  adjustable partial dumps, forward/reverse
     page viewing,  adjustable page markers.  Almost like a mini  word
     processor.  Why?   Because:  full  screen  cursor  control;  edit
     binary or text data; frwd/rev scroll with position readout;  hex,
     dec,  bin readout;  set range;  hex,  dec, bin entry;  add/remove
     linefeeds (useful  in  creating  these  articles);  insert  line;
     delete  range;  strip  character;  replace character;  convert to
     upper or lower case;  convert to ASCII or PETSCII (also  useful);
     reformat text; zero parity bit; all with instant on-screen help.

        Most  terminals  provide  a status line (usually at the top of
     the  screen).   So  does  Bobsterm.   Features  include:   Always
     visible;  carrier detect;  buffer on/off; buffer bytes remaining;
     local  echo  on/off;  incoming/outgoing  linefeed  on/off;   hook
     status,  macro  active  status (more on this later);  null filter
     on/off; caps lock on/off; word wrap on/off;  ascii/binary on/off;
     display  control  characters  on/off;  transfer  display  on/off;

     timer/time  of  day  clock  (uses  hardware  clock   built   in).
     Regarding  those macros:  two types are available.  One kind lets
     you customize "environments" for each board you  call  (including
     auto-dial of the number).  The other lets you automate the logon,
     or  even a whole session.  Be kinda nice to set it to go at 5 am,
     logon to your local Fido, read all the new messages, upload a few
     of your own, dump the whole session to disk, and shut down,  huh?
     Or,  you  can  even  use the circular dialing feature to "rotate"
     between logon macros.

        Here's where Bobsterm really  shines:  the  user  can  adjust:
     char/screen/status colors; ALL RS-232 parameters; baud rate up to
     2400;  baud  timing  trim control (mentioned in my last article);
     default drive # for transfers and separate defaults  for  macros;
     default  printer  device  and  secondary  address;  ASCII/PETSCII
     printer output;  printer auto/LF switch;  14 char printer control
     string; tone or pulse dialing; carrier detect switch; line delays
     up to 900 ms; char delays up to 90ms; char wait for echo; CRCK or
     CCITT checksum; XON/XOFF characters; XMODEM EOT, ACK, NAK, CAN, &
     EOF;  XMODEM block start;  XMODEM char start; XMODEM packet delay
     time; bell and answer-back; backspace, HTAB, CLR-SCRN; 6 char IN-
     filter; cursor type, 10 character fonts; save default parameters.

        Bobsterm also features a "remote mode",  where you  can  leave
     the  terminal  unattended  and people can logon and have full DOS
     access.  Features include: Remote DOS and transfers; user defined
     password code;  user defined welcome message;  full control  over
     transfer types.  Macros also work here.

        Terminal emulation features include: programmable emulator; 37
     emulator functions; presets for ADM-31; presets for VT-52 and VT-
     100;  user  definable  terminals.  This last means you can create
     your own "standard" terminal.

        For the advanced user,  there are built-in  file  conversions:
     PRG to SEQ; SEQ to PRG; ASCII IMG to PRG; PRG to ASCII IMG; strip
     source code comments;  C128 to CP/M; CP/M to C128.  These come in
     VERY handy!

        For those "into" IMAGE files,  there are a  host  of  features
     just for you: Actual/Two's complement sums; offset start address;
     byte count;  separator byte;  bytes per record; 1 or 2 byte sums;
     header length;  prompt  character;  header  character  string.  I
     don't  know  what  half of these are about,  but I'm sure various
     "techies" will.

        Here's what the  manual  says  about  macro  files:  unlimited
     storage  of  macros;  auto-dial  and logon for each #;  saves all
     parameters with #; automate ANY commands that can be accomplished
     via keyboard.  THIS is where you can fully automate a BBS  logon.
     It's  a  bit complicated,  but I've successfully used it.  I even
     put in a trap in case the sysop of  a  local  board  (FSS  BBS  -
     403-242-0749) jumped into chat mode.  He did, and got a surprise:
     "This  terminal is under machine control.  Please release me from
     CHAT mode and my operator will talk with  you  later."  I  got  a
     phone call 5 minutes later... boy, was HE upset!
     Fidonews                     Page 14                   3 Nov 1986


        I'll skip all the macro-specific stuff for now,  since they're
     of no use to you unless you actually have Bobsterm, in which case
     you have the manual  already.  All  (!)  this  leaves  is  the  8
     programmable  function  key  definitions,  where you program your
     function keys to send a string when it is  pressed.  F8  has  the
     added  feature  of  being  the  "answer-back" string.  If a board
     fires a CTRL-E at you,  Bobsterm will automatically send  the  F8
     definition.

        Now, any run of the mill terminal can have any or all of these
     features.  It's  the  implementation  which makes Bobsterm such a
     joy to use.  Completely menu driven means even  the  greenest  of
     novices can be online in minutes, while the seasoned veteran will
     be  flying  thru  various  control  sections  using just a couple
     keystrokes (ANY area can be accessed from the main  menu  with  a
     maximum of three keypresses).  The manual, while fairly simple in
     layout and design,  is very well written and covers all bases.  I
     have never used a terminal which has been  more  problem-free.  I
     only have two complaints:  it uses a non-standard way of selected
     choices.  To change from 300 to 1200  baud,  you  must  move  the
     cursor onto the appropriate menu entry, then press the RETURN key
     to  cycle the choices or SHIFT-RETURN to reverse cycle.  Use RUN-
     STOP to implement the selection.  A little odd,  but you get used
     to  it.  Also,  it  would  be  nice  if  the 40 column screen was
     supported.  Why 40 columns?  Because a few  of  the  local  BBS's
     only run in 40, and thus half my screen is wasted.  I used to use
     Pro-Term 64, which allowed either 40 or 80 (though the 80 columns
     was ATROCIOUS, being drawn on a 40 col hi-res screen).

        As  you  can  see,  I  am  fairly glowing in my praise of this
     program.  It shows a lot of thought and attention to detail,  and
     is  quite  the  masterpiece.  I strongly suggest you head down to
     your local Commodore dealer and give it a test run.  It carries a
     steep price tag (I paid $130 in Canadian  currency),  but  it  is
     well worth it.

        I'm interested in answering any of your questions about either
     the 64 or 128.  If you are having a problem,  please address your
     mail to Joe Lindstrom via Calgary Fido (Net 134 Node 1), and I'll
     address it in an upcoming article.  If you would like to  contact
     me  in  person,  I  run  a  300  baud  BBS ("The Flight Deck") at
     403-235-1659.
