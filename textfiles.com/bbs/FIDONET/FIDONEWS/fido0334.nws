                               some comments


           I will attempt something I have never done before.....

           I will "try" to write a review of a program I  found  on  a
     board in Arizona called appropriately "MAILCOST"

           I have used this program for accounting mail in our net now
     for  about  a month and find that although it is well written and
     certainly does check and account for  ALL  out-of-town  mail,  it
     does it in a manner  that  is  inconsistent  with  the  way  Fido
     accounts the actual costs to the user.  Fido subtracts the listed
     cost  of  a  message from the users account regardless of whether
     there are other messages going to the same node or host.  This is
     I believe the way that MOST hosts try to keep up  with  the  mail
     costs for a net. While "MAILCOST" does certainly keep a record of
     the  mail from each node,  it does it by taking ALL messages to a
     certain host and lumping the cost together.  It then divides  the
     cost of the call (supplied by the host) between the nodes who had
     mail  for  that  node/host.  While  this  is certainly cheaper it
     places an additional load on the host & the sysop of  the  system
     to  update  the users account to reflect the savings (not an easy
     task I assure you) each time the mail is accounted.  This results
     in confusion of the users as to actually "how much" the  messages
     cost.  Fido  tells  them that a message to node xxx/xx costs $.25
     each and then when they send the message and the host gets say  2
     or three in for that host then the actual cost is lowered.  There
     is  no  way  the host can ACCURATELY specify to the user what the
     ACTUAL cost will be until after the mail is sent. It is much like
     an estimate from a repair  shop,  sometimes  accurate  but  often
     wrong.

           I  have a few suggestions for the author of the program.  I
     don't want  to  sound  like  I  am  jumping  his  case  (which  I
     definitely  AM  NOT)  but  I think that by looking at it from the
     AVERAGE hosts point of  view  he  will  come  up  with  a  vastly
     improved version that could account the mail in two ways,  either
     being specified by the host using the program.

           Suggestion #1:  Set the program up to ADD up the total cost
     of the mail from each NODE separately BY USER NAME. This way each
     message  sent  will  be  counted as a separate call (although not
     always the case) and logged  appropriately.  Thus  the  host  can
     inform  the node each accounting period of the Fido-based cost of
     his nodes mail. I suggest a log format as follows:

           NODE #     USER NAME        # msgs         Total COST

           123/1      Jim Brown           2              $0.50
           123/1      Sysop               4              $1.00
           123/5      Sysop               7              $1.75
           123/6      Sysop              20              $5.00
                       ( I send a LOT of mail out for myself)

           This way the host knows how much Fido ACTUALLY charged  the
     user  and  since most hosts collect BEFORE they allow the user to
     send mail then they can deduct this from the account of the  user
     regardless  of what node the user is on.  Any savings realized by
     the host due to multiple messages to  the  same  node/host  could
     either be passed back to the user or used to help cover the costs
     of  bringing  in  such  filesas FidoNews and the NodeDiff.a* each
     week.  I am sure that most hosts try to do as much  as  they  can
     afford,  let's  face  it  no matter what,  calls for the news and
     nodediff costs the host money and since there is no one  for  him
     to  try  to  pass  the  costs on to he ends up eating about $15 a
     month over the cost of operation of the system.

           By making the program capable of working  either  like  the
     format it now has or by the format I have proposed (selectable by
     the  sysop/host),  I  am  sure  the author would realize that the
     accounting method he uses now, while good, is based on paying for
     mail after the fact which would mean letting anyone  in  the  net
     send mail at any time without having to put up a cent. This could
     run  the  host  a  bundle  and I don't think this was the authors
     intention.  Also if the host did do it this way he could stand to
     lose  a lot of money from people not paying him what they owe for
     mail.

           Again I am not on anyones case this is simply  constructive
     criticism and I hope it is taken that way.

     Jerry Hindle, 123/6

                             Quit Belly-aching


          After  reading  FidoNews  issue  332  I  get  the   distinct
     impression that some of you fortunate enough to be able to attend
     the  conference in Colorado went there for one reason,  to belly-
     ache!

          Come off it people,  I mean Thom Henderson,  Ben Baker,  Ken
     Kaplan,  and  TOM  JENNINGS  have busted their butts to keep this
     network going.  They have forged ahead  despite  the  adversities
     with  something they believed in.  They sure didn't do it for the
     profit potential,  I mean lets face it the  profit  potential  is
     simply non-existent.

          I read where tempers flared over the nomination of the board
     members  of  INFA,  I  read  where  people  were miffed that they
     couldn't cast proxy votes, etc.  I will say this one thing to all
     of you out there and then I will shut up.




     Tom Jennings didn't HAVE to release Fido the way he did. He could
     have  made  it a commercial package and gotten a LOT of money for
     it.

     Ben Baker didn't HAVE to work so long and hard  on  the  nodelist
     setup.  He could have left it where you had to edit the damn 137k
     long  file  by  hand  each  week.  He  could have simply not done
     anything in which case there would be no network.

     Ken Kaplan didn't HAVE to work so hard to  organize  the  network
     into regions,  net,  and nodes.  He could have left it as was and
     let you figure out how to send the mail to the west coast to  one
     particular board and one board only.

     Thom Henderson didn't HAVE to volunteer for newsletter publisher.
     He  could  have  gone his merry way and we would have no means of
     finding out what the Fidos outside  our  local  area  were  doing
     without having to call all over the world.

          I  say  this  to  the  person  that said the hell with these
     people,  he already had a network if Ken and Ben and Tom Jennings
     and  Thom  Henderson  didn't  like  it.  If  you think you have a
     network just STOP and THINK what you would have if  these  people
     had  done  NOTHING.  You  would  have  just  that......NOT A DAMN
     THING!!!!!!!!!!

          Quit your damn belly-aching and let these  people  do  their
     job.  You  concern yourself with running your little piece of the
     machine (this could apply to everyone) and TOGETHER we  can  make
     this network WORK for the good of us ALL.

     Eric Ewanco, The AmERICan BBS, SEAdog 130/3

         The response to my MSGCRYPT program has been so positive that
     I've decided to announce some of my other programs I've  written.
     Any  program  I've written can be either file requested by SEAdog
     or for Fidos,  send me a message and I'll hold a file attach  for
     you  (no  trouble  at  all).  Either  Poll me or Pickup me with a
     message to me the next day. Here are some of them:

     CALLERS.ARC:  Modify the caller count.  Show,  add  to,  subtract
       from, and set the caller count. (Not for caller count stuffing!
       Use when converting BBS software or after a crash.)

     SYSEDIT.ARC:  (no  docs)  Full  screen  fancy system file editor.
       Arrow-key editing,  change caller count,  sort files  by  priv,
       exchange files, insert in the middle or delete from the middle,
       rotate all files.

     DARC.ARC:  Archive  utility.  Scans  an archive for filenames and
       deletes those filenames from the  current  dir.  For  use  when
       you've dearchived a large archive and decide you don't like it;
       instead  of  individually finding which files were in there are
       deleting them, run DARC and it will automatically delete them!

     ARCDIV.ARC: Archive utility. Remove certain files from an archive
       to a separate archive without unpacking and repacking them.

     LASTUSER.ARC: Read LASTUSER.BBS and display stats.

     CHECKCD.COM: (12 bytes) Return errorlevel 1 on no CD.

     MOVEULS.ARC: Aid in moving uploads from u/l dir to file areas.

     ALTPAGE.ARC:  Separates odd and even pages of  docs  so  you  can
       print on both sides of the paper

     SKIPPAGE.ARC: Extract pages from the middle of large docs


     From Eric Ewanco on SEAdog 130/3, Enjoy!

     Tom Emerson, 16/635

     Can a computer become intelligent?  This is  a  question  that  a
     select  group  of  scientists have been asking for over 30 years.
     All will agree that the answer is yes,  but  not  in  their  life
     time,  or  their  childrens lifetime.  But when the computer does
     become intelligent,  what will be its implications on the  world?
     How  will  the  intelligent computer effect the world in which we
     live in, and that of our great great grandchildren?

     Artificial Intelligence (AI) hs  been  called  a  half  breed  of
     academic  research in psychology,  philosophy,  linguistics,  and
     computer science.  Because  of  this,  most  AI  researchers  are
     frowned  upon  by  their  colleagues  in other fields of science.
     They feel that AI is something that should be  left  alone,  that
     computers are not here to be intelligent, but to help intelligent
     people.  Joseph Weizenbaum, a noted computer scientist at M.I.T.,
     has  gone  as far as to describe "...AI as the province of madmen
     and psycopaths."

     The AI Conference will try to answer these  questions  about  the
     future  of  intelligent  computers,  as well as inform you of the
     latest findings in the  AI  field.  Short  tutorials  on  various
     areas  of  AI  will also be included periodically.  It is a place
     where your questions about AI can be answered.  Languages such as
     LISP and Prolog will  be  supported.  AI  programming  techniques
     will be discussed if there is interest.

     What is AI all about?  What exactly does AI mean?  For answers to
     these, take a look at the AI Conference.

                       International Fido Conference
                             August 14-17, 1986
                          per Allen Miller, 108/0


          The conference was hosted by the Colorado Springs User Group
     and they did a fine job.  There were somewhere  around  100  Fido
     Sysops  (some  with  wives).  The  Sysops  came from all over the
     United States;  there were also Sysops from Canada, Great Britain
     and Holland.  It was a great experience to meet face-to-face with
     the  people  I had been writing e-mail to for the last two years.
     I overheard a conversation between  Thom  Henderson  and  Donovan
     Kuhn  where  Thom  told  Donovan  that he looked just like he had
     pictured him.  That guy must be clairvoyant.

          I arrived too late for the Thursday  evening  session  which
     featured  Ezra  Shapiro  of  Byte  Magazine.  Ezra didn't make it
     either as he was bailing water out of his house.  Seems they have
     the same kind of plumbing problems in S.F.  that the rest  of  us
     experience  from time to time.  Over the weekend we got to hear a
     good bit from Ezra who proved to be the  stabilizing  force  that
     was needed for some of our 'discussions'.

          I  will  skip  to  the  topic  that I think most of my local
     Sysops are interested in and will get back to  the  rest  of  the
     conference in some fashion.

     VERSION 12
     ==========

          Tom  Jennings  is working on it.  However,  it seems like it
     will be much more involved than I had imagined.  The network  has
     been growing at geometric paces.

        * Dates for availability ranged from September to January *.

          Fido's  current  internal  nodelist table has room for 1,200
     nodes.  If the nodelist has more than 1,200 nodes, Fido will just
     skip the ones beyond.  Until v12 is out,  Fido Administrators can
     help  by  eliminating  inactive  Fido's  when  they send in their
     nodelist updates.  Also,  if you have entries indicated as  DOWN,
     just  put  a  semicolon before them to change to a comment.  This
     will also help.

          If you remember the time before Nets,  when there were  only
     Nodes,  then you will be able to appreciate this.  In May,  1984,
     there were about 10 Fido's;  in June,  1985 there were about  160
     Fido's  and  the Net concept was introduced;  at September,  1986
     there are now almost 1,200 Fido's and the Zone is the  new  step.
     A  Zone will be a group of Nets.  Initially,  Zones might line up
     with countries.  Down the road a Zone might even be a subset of a
     country.

          Just imagine it.  If nothing else in Fido changed other than
     the Zone concept, jillions of Fido utilities would have to change
     to accommodate the new structure of Zone/Net/Node  replacing  the
     Fidonews                     Page 10                   8 Sep 1986


     current  Net/Node.  Fido v12 can't just be haphazardly introduced
     into the bbs world without a lot of work/time to  at  least  have
     compatible versions of the most important utilities like listgen,
     editnl, xlatlist, and robot.

          There will be several months between the distribution of v12
     and  the  introduction  of  new  Zone  numbers.  This  will  give
     everyone a chance to get  familiar  with  the  new  software  and
     hopefully keep the confusion during the changeover to a minimum.

          Some other areas of change.

     1. Fido's  internal  version  of the nodelist will be a disk file
        instead of loaded to memory.  The list  is  just  getting  too
        big.  Tom  Jennings  said  he  rewrote the search code so when
        Fido needs to check an address against the nodelist,  it  will
        be real fast.

     2. To  make  international mail more efficient,  a 'gate' concept
        for outgoing mail of one country to be funneled  to  the  gate
        who would process and send mail destined for a second country.

     3. Because of the size of the nodelist and the other related Fido
        structures,  Fido will not be a system that will run well on a
        floppy based system.  Fido will want a hard disk  for  storage
        capacity.

     4. Fido  will  have  no  more  command  line  switches other than
        perhaps the /T test mode.  Tom's comment was that  there  just
        weren't enough letters available for additional controls.  All
        these type controls will be handled from a text file,  as will
        be the event schedule.

     5. The version 11 manual was over  300k  bytes.  The  version  12
        manual  will  not  be downloadable.  It will be professionally
        printed and available for purchase for some reasonable  number
        of clams.

     6. There  will  be  new  handling of system security in v12.  Our
        names (Twit,  Normal,  etc.) will go by  the  wayside  and  be
        replaced with numbers.  Security will work on a 'mask' concept
        which  will  let you have much more control of access by user,
        area, and function.

     7. To conform to the current times regarding security  of  e-mail
        and disclosure....  Normal level users will be given a message
        that the 'Sysop can read Private mail'.

          I am sure that there are more new features  and  goodies  of
     v12 than I have covered here.  However, that is all that I had in
     my  notes  or that I could remember from Tom Jennings' conference
     session.  Anyway,  knowing Tom a little,  I expect there will  be
     some minor things that he wouldn't have thought to discuss in the
     meeting.  We'll just have to wait and see.

     ==================================

          IFNA  (pronounced  "if-nuh")  is  the International Fido Net
     Association.  It is a nonprofit  organization  created  to  be  a
     vehicle  to  raise  tax  deductible  money to support the ongoing
     needs of this large organization.  The  Board  of  Directors  was
     approved  to  be  Ken Kaplan,  Ben Baker and Thom Henderson.  The
     Articles of Incorporation (or some kind of legal b...s...  to use
     a term of George Wing) were voted on and approved at the meeting.
     Preparing Bylaws is a step that remains to be done.

          There  was  a  lot  of  energy  invested  to  get this group
     organized (lets hear some applause).  At the conference there was
     a lot of energy expended on some less  productive  discussion  of
     the  so-called  issues.  Suffice  it  to say (good old hindsight)
     that more communication on the agenda of incorporation might have
     made people more happy.  However,  I say that there are  probably
     some people in the world that you can never please.  Since all of
     us  donate  our  time for this effort,  I wouldn't loose too much
     sleep over the small minority.  If you weren't there,  you missed
     some interesting interpersonal interaction.

     FidoNet Standards Committee
     ===========================

          Randy  Bush,  along with his committee,  has done a fabulous
     job on what will be the most meaningful contribution to the world
     of telecommunications that I could have imagined.  Randy has been
     developing the FidoNet standards document.

          The FidoNet  Standards  Document  will  be  a  thorough  and
     complete  documentation of how to send mail between computers via
     communications links.  Can you believe it,  this will contain the
     first  complete  documentation of XMODEM protocol.  This document
     will be used by authors of other systems to  incorporate  FidoNet
     compatibility.

          A 64k microcomputer (commodore,  volkswagen, etc.) could not
     load the entire Fido program and could not  possibly  participate
     in  the  network.  With this document,  programmers will have the
     tools to adapt  their  communications  software  to  the  FidoNet
     requirements.  Voila,  worldwide  mail  network brought to you by
     FidoNet.

          Some enterprising Fido Sysops have already worked out  links
     to other networks,  Usenet and Bitnet,  to name two.  Imagine it,
     other non-micro based nets could spring up that use  the  FidoNet
     Standards  and  thereby  be  directly  compatible  with  any Fido
     system.  It's just incredible.

     Rest of the Meeting
     ===================

          There were interesting sessions on SEAdog,  Thom  Henderson;
     Fido  with Multilink,  Allen Miller (cough,  cough);  USRobotics,
     Welch and Smith (I think);  Echomail,  Jeff  Rush;  Routing,  Ben

     Baker;  ARC,  Andy  Foray;  FidoNet International,  Henk Wevers &
     Frank Thornley;  Unix  Gateway,  Bob  Hartman;  and  NAPLS,  Dave
     Hughes.

          In  addition  to the formal presentations,  there were many,
     many impromptu sessions in the hallways, bar and nice hospitality
     suite that SEA provided.

          We went to the Flying W Ranch Saturday night for some cowboy
     food and music.  The Flying W Ranch is number two in  the  United
     States  for consumption of red beans,  next to Wendy's.  We had a
     great meal and got to hear some good picking and  strumming.  The
     clouds  in  the  sky were forgiving and we had a lot of fun.  The
     food lines served 1,400 people in 25 minutes.  That's what I call
     a chuck wagon.

          Sunday morning we got to ride the  Manitou  and  Pikes  Peak
     Railway  Cog  Wheel  Train  up to the top of Pikes Peak.  We rode
     from 6,000'  to  14,110'  in  about  one  hour.  The  views  were
     glorious.  It really makes you glad to be alive.

     The End
     =======

          Much  thanks  to our hosts,  the Colorado Springs User Group
     and Dick Bertrand, George Wing,  Chuck Sanders,  Woody Wood,  Jim
     Cannell who all worked hard to make our meeting a great success.

                  Problem with the date format in FIDOmail

     The utility FU have just been released,  and I noticed that  this
     program  writes  the  the creation date different from FIDO.  The
     problem is that Fido cannot recognice which date  this  mail  was
     created so "Delete messages by age" do not work in FIDO. I have a
     suggestion  that the syntax for the date will be set so everybody
     which write utilities can use the same  expression.  From  Kermit
     protocoll I got following:

         Creation  Date,  expressed  as "[yy]yymmdd[ hh:mm[:ss]]" (ISO
         standard julian format),  e.g.  831009  23:59.  The  time  is
         optional;  if given,  it should be in 24-hour format, and the
         seconds may be omitted,  and a single space  should  separate
         the time from the date.

     Therefore I suggest that the format for FIDOmail creation date is
     YYMMDD  HH:MM which only occupies 13 bytes and because of that it
     will be 7 bytes for future things.

     This is only the structure in the messages.  I  think  that  FIDO
     would  write  out the date in the same manner as today.  Maybe it
     could be changed so it is ok all over  the  world  by  using  the
     Country Dependent Information (MSDOS SYSTEM CALL 38H).

         Regards from Europe and Sweden
         Lennart Svensson
         FIDO 501/4602

     To author of FU:  I hope you recognize the problem with your date
     format.

     The message which appeared in Dutch on p  14  of  Fido328.Nws  is
     here  translated  by Jeanine Fegan.  Mrs.  Fegan has consented to
     translate into Dutch any reply you wish to send Loek Jansen. Send
     your reply through Kurt Kurosawa  at  19/201  (Texarkana  Region/

     --[ English Translation ]----------------------------------

     Hello,  everybody!  There are some problems with Commodores using
     Fido:

     1st - Upload.  This  doesn't  work  with  the  Teletron  1200  or
     Multimodem 64.

     2nd - Download.  This doesn't work with these modems,  either.  A
     few users asked me several times what we can do about this.

     Does someone have a solution or know of a modem that doesn't have
     these problems? [ Note: It would help if you knew of one which is
     sold in Holland, or could send PD or Freeware programs that would
     enable the use of these modems --KK ]

     There are two new programs from Commodore users that I'd like  to
     post  for downloading IF they're in the public domain.  They were
     written for the Micro-Master tournament.  If you  know  something
     about these programs, please let me know.

     "Friendly greetings", Loek Jansen, Sysop Rozenburg 1

     Bob Robesky, 10/26

                           More coals on the fire
                                     or
                         IFNA in 500 words or less

          For those who think IFNA came out of a  hat.  Its  formation
     was discussed in Fido Newsletter # 325.

          There can be no doubt but that the initial formation of IFNA
     and  it's implementation were handled poorly.  However,  I have a
     very real problem in suddenly deciding that the  folks  who  have
     kept  it  organized  and  running  for  the past two years,  have
     written many of  the  utilities  and  compiled  and  shipped  the
     newsletter,  have  given  freely  of  their  time and money,  are
     suddenly to be viewed as untrustworthy money grubbing assholes. I
     don't really believe we are witnessing the beginning of  an  evil
     empire.

          The  issue  that  only  those in attendance who were paid up
     members of IFNA would have the right to vote was stupid  and  was
     dropped at the actual business meeting.

          The question of proxy votes was never discussed by anyone at
     the business meeting though it was mentioned in the newsletter.

          Tom  Jennings  and  Fido  Software are a separate issue from
     IFNA.  Tom is on IFNA the board of directors,  but Fido  Software
     is NOT part of IFNA.

          (I personally think that Tom should be compensated for Fido.
     Many  of  us  use  Fido  as  both  a  hobby  and  to  promote our
     businesses.  I own a computer store, I hope to gain sales,  but I
     don't  force  anyone to buy from me in order to use the board.  I
     also don't run a non-profit business. There is no rational reason
     to believe that Tom Jennings should continue to provide  us  with
     free  entertainment.  He  is a programmer and that's how he makes
     his living; the Fido code belongs to him, not us.

          An aside in an aside:  the FidoNet standard is going to  be,
     has  been,  made  public  and  will allow any one who wants to to
     write a truly "free" bbs system  that  incorporates  the  FidoNet
     protocol.

          Besides which, it is not really clear to me that TJ is going
     to  charge  for version 12.  What is clear is that the Version 12
     reference manual will cost  money.  It  is  being  written  by  a
     professional writer,  it is being bound in book form, and both of
     these items cost money;  writers and publishers  don't  work  for
     nothing.

          If  there  is  a  charge  for  the new version you have some
     choices.  If you don't want to buy it, don't. As I understand it,
     there is no real compelling reason  to  upgrade  unless  you  are
     involved  to international mail.  If you don't think Tom Jennings
     should be paid for the work he has done,  and,  until now anyway,
     Fidonews                     Page 16                   8 Sep 1986


     the  fun and enjoyment he has brought you,  well then,  don't pay
     him.  Another choice, of course, is to buy one copy of version 12
     and spread it all over the Net;  not a very nice solution, but it
     would  certainly  stifle Tom's attempt to make some money off his
     software and probably kill Fido in the process.)

          Back to IFNA:  what the hell can IFNA really do without  our
     cooperation?

          IFNA is only a name with no real power until we give it, and
     can't, at least at this time, be mandatory; how are they going to
     make  you  join if you don't want to?  The immediate advantage of
     being a member of IFNA is that you will,  at least,  I  hope  you
     will,  have  a say about the by-laws and how IFNA will be run and
     what it's direction will be.  If you are not a  member  you  will
     have  no  input,  and it will be harder to change,  or implement,
     anything after the initial structure is in place.  The long range
     advantages range from potential tax  deductions  to  a  political
     power base.

          However,  and  this  is  a  big however,  without us IFNA is
     nothing more that a name registered on a few pieces of  paper  in
     the state of Missouri. IFNA, at least at this point, does not own
     the rights to much of anything. The FidoNet utilities are already
     written, the structure is in place. Everything needed to function
     is  already  available.  So,  if  IFNA  becomes a closed society,
     requires mandatory attendance at meetings in Missouri on  the  14
     of  each month when the moon,  or is it the sun,  is in Aquarius,
     bites your dog,  pisses in the pool,  etc.;  well  then  fork'em,
     start an alternate Network.

          And here folks is what we're talking about in real money: 48
     cents  a  week,  less than the cost of a soft-drink,  less than a
     beer, certainly less than a pack of cigarettes.

     HLee - Jones' Nose Fido 101/132


     A Big Week For FidoNet

     The past week or so has been a big one  for  FidoNet.  There  was
     the  Fido Conference,  and a Fido made national news by being the
     largest pirate board yet uncovered.

     In some ways,  I think these two events are related by more  than
     the time of their occurrence.


     Perceptions of the Net

     I  read  with  interest  the  newsletter  articles  on  the  Fido
     Conference,  and the great forment regarding the formalization of
     IFNA.

     It  reminded me of some of the discussions I had with some of the
     principals years ago.  Their conclusion was that FidoNet is not a
     democracy,  but a bunch of small fiefdoms  unified  by  a  common
     technology.

     Another  way  of  putting this is that FidoNet is what its sysops
     perceive it to be,  with the  caveat  that  the  sysops  did  not
     control  the technology - Tom Jennings and St.  Louis control the
     technology.


     Why we run a Fido

     Before  we  can  understand  why  FidoNet  exists,  each  of  the
     individual  sysops  has to understand why their individual Fido's
     exist.

     In our case,  we run a BBS to allow us to collect and  distribute
     public domain software among local users, mail among local users,
     and  communications  among the developers and beta testers of our
     company.  We run Fido in particular because of the  wide  variety
     of  file  transfer  protocols it supports.  (This is a particular
     thorn in our side,  as we shall discuss later.)  The  network  is
     strictly  a side benefit,  one that costs more monetarily than it
     returns in any sense.


     Far be it from me to agree with Mikey

     Mike Hamilton and I certainly have had our disagreements.  I have
     also had my disagreements with both  Mr.  Jennings  and  the  St.
     Louis crowd.

     However,  from  what  I  read,  Mike  (Mikey  as he is derisively
     referred to by everyone - and Lord Mikey by myself in  the  past)
     seems  to  be  under  attack  because  he  is  asking questions -
     questions that seem to be valid.  When I was  there,  despite  my
     Fidonews                     Page 18                   8 Sep 1986


     problems  with  him,  and  despite  reservations  I  had with the
     technical solutions he implemented as the local  host,  Mike  did
     one  hell  of a job.  I find it difficult to believe that Mike is
     Fidonews                     Page 19                   8 Sep 1986


     whining about the money per se,  which is the implication of many
     of the authors in the past newsletter.


     I already pay for about everything

     In  running  our  Fido,  we already pay for just about everything
     ourselves.  We have to pick up our own newsletters and nodelists.
     We get very little net mail,  and a good  bit  of  that  is  file
     attached, and therefore not routed through any hosts.


     Our node takes NO money from our operations

     There  is  a very simple reason for this,  one that I will hammer
     home again and again: If I take money for running my system, I am
     obligated to provide something.  (That something would have to be
     well defined, which is one of the reasons we don't.)


     How this all relates to the Pirate Fido

     How  does  all this relate to the Pirate Fido?  Well,  until just
     recently,  the informal political structure of Fido was presented
     in  a  document  called  Policy1 or Policy2.  In these documents,
     there were essentially three rules stated:  Be a  NetNode  during
     the national window, don't hassle another sysop, and don't put up
     pirate  software.  The rest of the document goes to great lengths
     to describe how  the  various  levels  of  sysops  or  netops  or
     whatever  you  want  to  call them are supposed to (for want of a
     better word) enforce these rules, and what the appeal process for
     this enforcement is.

     Now that Fido was NOT shut down through this  process  -  it  was
     shut  down from the outside.  While I hope Mr.  Miller is correct
     in the statements he made in his letter to InfoWorld  about  most
     Fido's being honest,  I am dissillusioned that,  for some reason,
     this  gaucherie  was  allowed  to  continue  despite  the  formal
     policies.  I  find  it  quite  difficult to believe that a pirate
     board of that magnitude (and apparent openness) was not known  at
     least  to the local net,  which would seem to imply that at least
     the local net failed to meet its responsibilities as outlined  in
     the aforementioned documents.

     The  formalization of IFNA can only lead to more rules - I am not
     saying this is good or bad per se.  But I have to ask myself what
     will happen in the future when there are  more  rules,  and  more
     formal mechanisms for their enforcement,  when we cannot abide by
     the simplest of rules now?  Given that the money  IFNA  wants  to
     take  in  will  not  be used for salaries,  how will more time be
     budgeted to these problems?


     Understandings, Misunderstandings, and Questions

     IFNA Membership will not be required to be on the nodelist
     Fidonews                     Page 20                   8 Sep 1986


     This was the most re-assuring  statement  I  read  in  the  whole
     newsletter.  It  will  be  interesting  to  see  how many pay the
     membership, and at what juncture.
     Fidonews                     Page 21                   8 Sep 1986


     Railroading and expediency

     There was a lot of discussion about railroading - that  IFNA  had
     basically determined what they were going to do and tried to just
     force it on the body of the meeting.

     I  believe  there  are  valid  arguments  on  both  sides  of the
     discussion.   On  the  one  hand,  if  the  initial  articles  of
     incorporation allow sufficient input, they are certainly not cast
     in concrete (it is just a lot of "legal stuff" in that sense.) It
     also  makes  sense  that a well defined outline of the structure,
     and perhaps one or two alternatives are best  prepared  in  small
     groups,  and then presented to the body as a whole for discussion
     and affirmation.

     However, as tight as time is for everyone involved, I believe the
     IFNA officers dropped the ball by not giving the body as a  whole
     a much better idea, in writing, of what was going to happen, what
     the  structure  will  be,  and  what  the alternatives are.  This
     should have been in the hands of anyone  coming  to  the  meeting
     before  they  even left for it.  It should have been in the hands
     of those of us  who  could  not  attend,  with  enough  time  for
     discussion across the net.

     There  is  an  important  question  this raises.  The monies IFNA
     takes in are NOT supposed to be allocated to salaries.  (That  is
     my understanding of the facts,  not necessarily a statement of my
     feelings  on  the  wisdom  of  the  decision  ...   an  important
     distinction.)  Given  this,  the  IFNA  officers  should not have
     significantly more time to dedicate to politics and  organization
     in  the  future than they have in the past - in fact,  as FidoNet
     grows,  they  will  have  to  spend  more  time  tending  to  the
     technology.  Given  all  of this,  what reason is there to expect
     IFNA to do a better job in the future than they have in the past?


     Rates of Growth

     An important point  that  seems  to  have  been  ignored  in  the
     discussions in the newsletter is the rate of growth.  FidoNet has
     been growing at about 100% per year  -  doubling  in  size  every
     year.  If  we  assume  that the $25 is contributed by every node,
     this means we are talking about a  $100K  budget  in  two  years.
     While  I have no reason to assume that everyone will kick in $25,
     I have a feeling  that  if  IFNA  does  emerge  alive  from  this
     quagmire,  it  will be close to 100%.  I certainly have no reason
     to assume the rate of growth will subside - it would seem  to  me
     the  national  density of Fido population should approach what it
     is now in metropolitan areas - in other words,  10's of thousands
     of them.

     One  statement  that  really  bothered  me  was attributed to Ken
     Kaplan - that the $25 IFNA fee might be enforced for all nodes to
     LIMIT the growth  of  the  net.  I  had  always  been  under  the
     impression the goal was to EXPAND the net - was I simply mistaken
     in this, or have the goals changed?

     "They have been running it for 2.5 years and can keep running it"

     This is not a direct quote,  but an attribution to TJ in the past
     newsletter.  I cannot comment on the veracity of the attribution.
     However,  the statement itself reveals a basic flaw  in  FidoNet.
     FidoNet  is  no longer Tom Jennings' or Ken Kaplan's or whoever's
     baby.  It is ours, the sysops, as a whole.


     When I pay for something, I expect something for it

     As I mentioned before,  I have this peculiar New England trait  -
     when  I pay for something,  I expect something in return.  One of
     the things I expect is a product that works.  Fido does, largely,
     but in one or two areas,  it does not.  Particularly,  Kermit and
     the limited range of modem support.

     It  is  extremely  bothersome that TJ insists the Kermit problems
     are on the Columbia  tape  itself.  For  a  number  of  technical
     reasons  (the limited character set you can pump through a packet
     switched network) I HAVE to  use  Kermit  of  all  the  protocols
     offered  by Fido.  And despite Mr.  Jenning's protestations,  his
     doesn't work,  and all the versions I have taken off the Columbia
     tape (about 6 in regular use, including Unix) do.


     Conversely, I don't generally pay for a pig in a poke

     From  what  I  have  read,  this is exactly what was asked of the
     attendees at the Fido conference.


     A bottomless pit

     The $25 IFNA fee  would  probably  not  kill  most  Fido  sysops.
     However, it does not stop there, and that is what scares a lot of
     us.

     TJ  is talking $40 (effectively) for Fido itself.  At that price,
     I assume that is for a single version,  and the next one (and the
     next  one)  will  cost  close  to the same.  You can't run a Fido
     without ARC ($35-$50 depending on how you go about it.) You  need
     a nodelist editor of some sort (another $25 or so).  You probably
     need communications software - $50?

     So all the sudden,  the relatively minimal cost becomes much much
     greater.  More importantly,  the rules are  changed,  in  a  very
     insidious way.  We were all brought into the net under one set of
     assumptions  -  that  we could get on board for nothing,  get the
     latest and greatest software and documentation for  nothing.  and
     communicate cheaply.  All the sudden, this seems to be changing -
     after 1000 sysops and god knows how many users have come to count
     on the network.

     My Five Cents

     Version   12  should  not  be  mandated  until  alternatives  are
     sanctioned
     Fidonews                     Page 24                   8 Sep 1986


     One or two of the articles  in  the  newsletter  referenced  Fido
     alternatives,  and  the  documentation  of the Fido protocols.  I
     believe one of the most  important  steps  to  be  taken  is  the
     separation of the technology from the politics.

     Tom  Jennings has,  without doubt or reservation,  accomplished a
     masterful feat in Fido.  But even the best of  artists  can  have
     feet of clay.

     Feel  free to jump all over me if I'm wrong (you will anyway) but
     one has to at least  question  the  timing  and  motives  of  the
     changes  of  v12.  It comes at a time when the existing standards
     are to be documented to the point of allowing  the  existance  of
     clones.  Will  it  be  compatible  with  previous  versions  (and
     clones),  and if not,  how major will the  changes  be,  and  how
     forthcoming will TJ be with the specifications of those changes?

     It  might  be  wise  for  IFNA  not to make this transition until
     clones are available and sanctioned,  if for no other reason than
     to  eliminate possible conflict of interest charges.  (It appears
     to me that you virtually MUST pay for  V12,  and  FidoSoft  is  a
     profit  making  corporation  (at  least  in  the legal sense as I
     understand it) and that FidoSoft will therefore directly  benefit
     from  a decision by IFNA,  a non-profit organization,  to upgrade
     the network to v12.)


     DECUS parallels

     A lot of the structure outlined seems to reflect the roots of the
     St.  Louis crowd - DECUS.  This is not necessarily  bad  -  DECUS
     does  a  great  job  at  what  it  does.  But  there  are crucial
     differences - most of them related to money.

     A DECUS member understands that membership is basically a  ticket
     to  spend  more  money,  and comes from an environment where that
     spending can be afforded.  A DECUS member understands  the  value
     of intangible things like conferences.

     I  am  not sure the same is true of your typical Fido sysop.  The
     $25 annual membership to IFNA is not an expense  charged  to  the
     company  in  most  cases - it's a couple of pizzas not bought,  a
     couple of movies not seen,  or what have you.  The sysop is going
     to  want  to see something tangible for that $25 - and I have not
     seen anyone say what more they will get than  what  they  already
     have.  (I  am  not  saying  I AGREE this is right,  merely that I
     understand the perception.)

     There is another major difference between IFNA and  DECUS.  DECUS
     members  have  a much wider choice of vendors than potential IFNA
     members.  Sure,  you have to have a DEC processor to be  a  DECUS
     member - but last time I looked,  an 11/23 cost around $500, with
     all the other components obtainable from vendors other than  DEC.
     From  what  was  presented  in  the newsletter,  IFNA will not be
     sanctioning Fidoclones until after  v12  is  released.  In  other
     words,  the traditional "friendly adversary" relationship between
     Fidonews                     Page 25                   8 Sep 1986


     DECUS and DEC will not exist between IFNA and FidoSoft.  This  is
     not  necessarily  bad  per  se,  but  it  will  continue to raise
     questions at every phase of IFNA/FidoNet development.
     Fidonews                     Page 26                   8 Sep 1986


     Source Code for Fido - Fido From IFNA, not FidoSoft

     IFNA should consider sanctioning and distributing a source  level
     Fido  clone.  (This  is  not to say that all IFNA sanctioned Fido
     clones should be distributed in source -just the first ones.)

     I would much rather see IFNA charge more and be the  sole  source
     (or   primary  source)  for  Fido  Software  than  the  incestous
     relationship between IFNA and FidoSoft currently proposed.

     If TJ is not willing to contract to do this work,  I believe IFNA
     should  freeze  FidoNet at v11 levels until a sanctioned,  source
     version is available.

     There  are  arguments  both   for   and   against   source   code
     availability.  The  notable  argument against is that it makes it
     simple to intentionally or  unintentionally  screw  up  the  net.
     However,  the political structure of the network in theory should
     keep these problems in check.

     On the other side,  we currently have all our eggs in one basket,
     and from my point of view,  the basket leaks.  Beyond this, there
     are things the users want that TJ/IFNA say are not  possible,  or
     that  TJ does not have the time or inclination to do.  I maintain
     that very little is not possible,  but by forcing others to start
     from  total  scratch,  they make it nearly so.  I have also heard
     arguments (that I do not believe) that  there  are  trapdoors  in
     Fido  itself.  I would feel better in any case if I could look at
     the source to determine this for myself.


     IFNA better become more realistic about other uses of the net

     I  believe  that  many  Fido  sysops  percieve  FidoNet   as   an
     alternative  to  large,  charged systems,  with limitations.  The
     original goals of the founders of the  network  did  not  exactly
     jibe  with this.  In particular,  the main stated goal of the net
     is to allow for cheap,  point to point messaging.  The  explosion
     of  echomail  on the network,  and the desire for both broadcast,
     and truly private forms of messaging indicate that point to point
     messaging is only ONE of the percieved goals.

     I believe it will be difficult to resolve  the  political  issues
     while maintaining the limited,  point to point orientation of the
     net.

     In fact,  while it may be simpler from TJ's point of view,  I  am
     not really clear on why Fido and FidoNet are two different things
     - it would seem a better design to simply allow for either at any
     time with sysop control - and it is my understanding this is what
     SEADog in fact does.


     For the formation, only a node number should be required to vote

     I agree that once IFNA is going and in place, that dues should be
     Fidonews                     Page 27                   8 Sep 1986


     paid.  However, until that time, it seems reasonable to me that a
     node number, and only a node number should be required to vote on
     Fidonews                     Page 28                   8 Sep 1986


     the initial bylaws.


     The problem is not money - it is time

     One   basic  gap  in  the  logic  of  all  the  articles  on  the
     conference/IFNA formation is the arguments about money.  Money is
     not really the problem - Time is.  A number of people  said  that
     the phone costs for distributing nodelists was not the major cost
     of  running  IFNA - it was the costs of hand-holding and question
     answering.  If this is true (which seems very reasonable to  me),
     then those costs are minimal compared to the cost of Ken Kaplan's
     time doing same, or whoever is IFNA.

     To  reject  out  of hand the use of IFNA funds for salaries seems
     like a foolish place to begin.


     I am NOT questioning the motives of IFNA, TJ, or anyone

     I believe that everyone involved is trying to do  their  best  by
     FidoNet.  However,  we  started out with statements about FidoNet
     being what its sysops percieve it to be - and while  the  motives
     behind  the  actions of IFNA are probably above board,  they have
     not done a good job in keeping the perception of same on the part
     of the sysops.  IFNA must understand that the  symbiotic  balance
     between  TJ  and  IFNA  and  the  body  of  sysops as a whole has
     changed.  In the past,  the  network  operators  could  basically
     dictate  the  operation  of  the  net  as  they pleased.  But the
     success of the net, while due to their decisions,  depends on the
     body  of  sysops.  And at this time,  the body of sysops are in a
     position to survive without IFNA.  I am NOT advocating this  -  I
     believe it would be tragic.  But it scares me that people pointed
     this  out  to  IFNA  in very blunt terms in the newsletter.  IFNA
     must choose its path carefully,  and  perhaps  more  importantly,
     publicly.

                             A CRY FOR SUPPORT!
                                DEDICATED TO
                       V I E T N A M  V E T E R A N S
                      Their Wives, Lovers, and Friends
           Dedicated to those of us who know the true cost of war
                          And have paid the cost!

          A unique concept in the electronic bulletin board  communic-
     ations  medium  has  come to being in the San Francisco South Bay
     city of San Jose,  California.  Its overwhelming  success  during
     its  first  30  days of existence has made quite evident the fact
     that such a public service was needed.  Many call seeking  solace
     and support in it's message bases,  others simply to rekindle the
     friendships born in that conflict.

          The sysops, Todd and Nancy,  are more than qualified to host
     such  a public service,  as they are both Vietnam veterans.  Todd
     served as a Medical Field Surgeon attached to the  United  States
     Army's  101st  Airborne,  having  survived the horrors of being a
     Prisoner of War in  a  Laotian  prison  camp.  Nancy,  his  wife,
     fought  her war years after Todd returned from the steamy jungles
     of Southeast Asia.  Together they fought to keep  alive  a  rela-
     tionship that was everything to them,  and succeeded only after a
     bitter struggle where everything was nearly lost.

          Both of them feel a certain obligation to  share  themselves
     with  the  countless  men  and women who are still fighting their
     war,  with the hopes that somehow through their empathetic inter-
     vention,  they  might  help some of them find an end to that war.
     It is also their hope to enlighten those who were not a  part  of
     this  `war'  in  such  a  way as historians will never succeed in
     doing.

          Now,  Don Kulha,  sysop of the Survival Communication  Forum
     125/7, another Fido bulletin board north of the San Francisco Bay
     in Santa Rosa,  California has joined in Todd and Nancy's efforts
     to provide a place where not only veterans of the  Vietnam  `war'
     can  meet  to share their thoughts and feelings,  but where those
     who love and care for them can find  solice  as  well.  Something
     good is happening in California!

          What Todd, Nancy, and Don need now is your support in making
     a  good thing even better!  The time has come to begin a national
     Echo-mail Vietnam Veteran's Conference where we can  bring  other
     concerned  persons  together  all  across  this  United States of
     America!

          As the largest amateur network in the  world,  we  can  make
     this a grand success!  If you would be interested in joining with
     us in this service,  let us know by sending us a  message.  Echo-
     mail  is  rather a mystery to both the LooneyBin and the Survival
     Communications BBS's,  so even if you don't feel the call to  be-
     come  part  of  what  w are doing by joining in the national con-
     ference,  you can still support us with advice regarding the  in-
     tricacies  involved in setting such a medium up.  Any support you
     can offer will be greatly appreciated.

     A new net has been created in Southern California, net 166.  This
     net  consists  of  members of net 103 that have split off to form
     our own net due to disagreements about net management  procedures
     with  the  103 host.  If you are in Southern California and would
     like to join us,  send us a mail message to 166/1.  The  nodelist
     will show the new net starting with NODELIST.248.

     Node 103/511 (DataFlex Fido) is now the host of net 166.
