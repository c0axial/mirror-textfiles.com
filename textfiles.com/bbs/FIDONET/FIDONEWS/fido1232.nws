MY mother's name is Opal and i like having my hand held.
Who am i?

a:      2-4,4-7,2-6,4-4,4-5,5-C,3-2,3-A,4-8,4-6,5-2


...relatively unrelately, at least in my previous direction:
The February issue of "Waste Age" contains an article by
Cheryl L. McAdams, called "Resurrecting the Computer Graveyard".

i like how article rhymes with popsicle.

i learned something about networking today.  I went off on a secret
mission, to meet someone at a donought shop who was to take me to a
place.  I followed the directions towards getting there, or so i
thought, but when i arrived there was no-one waiting for me so i
waited for him instead.  I had forgotten his name, so when some people
asked me if i was looking for their friend who frequented the place,
and i confessed that i had forgotten his name, they spoke the name
of their friend and i inclined my head and bobbed it, up and down,
guessing that it sounded quite the same.

They said they had been there for a while but he hadn't shown up
yet, and i wondered aloud if i were possibly in the wrong donought
shop on the right street.  They suggested that i try the other one,
assuring me that if he showed up where they were to remain, that they
would inform him of my whereabouts, assuming i was to go to the
other place.  So i did.

He wasn't there either.

The other place was boring so i drove homewards, and in my anxiety i
noticed a black and green handpainted sign near a highway cut-off
with an arrow on it and above the arrow was written, in black and
green ink, "Albanian Picnic".

Having many less intruigueing but more pressing tasks to accomplish
in the near future, of course i decided to follow the sign and try
to find the albanian picnic.  I saw more Albanian picnic signs, some
of which included a smallish and delicate lobster logo which also
sort of looks like a bottle opener or a chamelion or a winged spider.
Most of these signs were placed JUST SO, at the near beginnings of
highway cut-offs.  I tended to see them just as it was too late to
turn, so i went round and round, over clover leaves, to get back on
so i could get back off.

Finally, eventually,.

The Albanian picnic was apparently already over to be replaced by
the Crowley family reunion but by then i didn't care, because
acreoss the street from the opening of the park where the picnic

wasn't, WAS A 1957 DESOTO!

i love that car.  i took pictures, so that the character mentioned
above can ride about in a 1957 Desoto.

The moral of this story is that bits only flow one way, so the
trick to hacking isn't driving quickly, it is TURNING quickly.

(eventually the desoto will be available by file request, but don't
hold your breath I AM NOT FAST contrary to popular opinion and
personal fantasy)

A_THEIST Echo on Zone 1 Backbone!

Christopher Baker
Rights On! 1:374/14

                      A_THEIST Echo Available

A_theism means free of religion in the way a_political means
free of politics or a_sexual means free of sex
characteristics or drives.

With that in mind and ever cognizant of the continued
pressure of religion to intrude itself into our government
and its operations, the A_THEIST Echo is provided to inform
and alarm and hopefully wake up the sleeping and too long
silent majority to the peril on our doorstep.

It is a Zone 1 Backbone Echo Hosted and Moderated by Rights
On! at 1:374/14 and Christopher Baker [card carrying member of
American Atheists, Inc.] and by Jackson Harding at 3:800/857
in Hawthorndene_SA_Australia. Links may be obtained from your
local Backbone source connection. Zone 3 is being Hubbed
through 3:800/857.

The Echo is open to anyone who can discuss, without
proselytizing, the extreme desirability of maintaining the
absolute separation of State and church in this country as
provided for in our Constitution.

A sample of the first few messages and the statement of
purpose of the Echo is available as A_THEIST.ZIP from this
system anytime except 0100-0130 ET and Zone 1 ZMH [USR HST
V32 online] if you wish to get an idea of whether to commit
disk space to the Echo.

It has been on the Backbone for years. Ask your Backbone
connection to get it for you! The complete info is available
in the current ELISTnnn.XXX file available from your NEC or
REC or here. [Request ELIST.]

I hope you will join us or ask your Sysop to request a link

via their regular Backbone connections!

North American Backbone FAQ
            ================================================
            ==      North American Backbone Frequently    ==
            ==        Asked Questions and HELP file       ==
01 Aug 95   ================================================
BOFAQ508.TXT

Terms used throughout this file:

Backbone.Na  -  A  text  file  listing  all  echoes,  and  their
        descriptions,  that  are  presently carried on the North
        American Backbone.  This text file  is  formatted  in  a
        manner  which  makes  it  easily  readable  by  EchoMail
        distribution software to use as a "forward  list".   The
        file  is  published  weekly  and distributed through the
        EchoMail Hubs.  Formerly known as Fidonet.Na.

Backbone.No - A file, distributed along with Backbone.Na,  which
        acts as a buffer for conferences that are in the process
        of being removed from Backbone distribution for  failing
        to  maintain a listing in the Echolist.  Conferences are
        customarily queued in this file for a period of 90 days.
        Formerly known as Fidonet.No.

Backstat.Na  -  A  North  American Backbone newsletter published
        weekly which, among other things, itemizes echoes  which
        are  in the process of being added to the North American
        Backbone as well as listing the Zone  and  Region  Hubs.
        Backstat.Na  is  distributed  in much the same manner as
        Backbone.Na.  It is advisable that those people who rely
        on  the  North  American  Backbone  get  in the habit of
        reading this file.  Formerly known as Fidostat.Na.

Echo (Conference) - An echomail conference is a message base  or
        forum, distributed under a specified echomail conference
        name, dealing with a defined area of interest.

Gateways - Echomail Gateways are nodes whose systems are used to
        exchange  mail  with other groups.  The term Gateway, as
        used here, includes all forms of gating  including,  but
        not   limited  to,  zone-gating,  inter-network  gating,
        intra-network gating, and domain-gating.

Hub - Echomail Hubs are people who  distribute  echomail.   Zone
        Hubs  distribute echomail at the zone level: Region Hubs
        distribute  echomail  at  the  region  level:  Net  Hubs
        distribute echomail at the net level.

FidoNews 12-32                 Page:  5                    07 Aug 1995

Moderator  -  Person(s) responsible for the echo and its liaison
        with the Backbone.

North  American  Backbone  -  Group  of  volunteers   who   help
        distribute EchoMail and routed netmail, the structure of
        which is somewhat flexible.  Customarily recognized as a
        set of tiers with the intention of distributing EchoMail
        in  an  accurate  and  expeditious  manner.   The  North
        American  Backbone  tiers  are  identified by the use of
        Hubs who subdivide and distribute to lower tiers.   From
        this  point  forward  throughout  this  file,  the North
        American Backbone will be referred to as, the "Backbone".

O.B.O. - Overseer of Backbone Operations  -  Person  responsible
        for  maintenance  of  this  help file and its associated
        distribution documents.  The  position  has  customarily
        been   occupied  by  the  Zone  1  EchoMail  Coordinator
        (identified  by  the  1:1/200  address  in  the  FidoNet
        nodelist).   Ultimately  responsible  for  all decisions
        regarding EchoMail distribution on  the  North  American
        Backbone.

O.B.O.  Council  -  A  group of people representing the EchoMail
        interests of the Zone,  assembled  for  the  purpose  of
        providing  input  and  perspective  to  the  O.B.O.  The
        Council consists of the 10 Region EchoMail Coordinators.

Region EchoMail Coordinator - In respect to the  Backbone,  this
        person  sits  on the O.B.O. council representing his/her
        respective  FidoNet   Region.   Each   Region   EchoMail
        Coordinator  can  be  identified  by  an  administrative
        address in the FidoNet nodelist in the form 1/2xx (where
        "xx" = the Region number.)

Zone  Echolist  -  As  it  relates  to  the Backbone, a database
        containing a list of echoes distributed by, or  aspiring
        to  be distributed by, the Backbone.  The format of this
        monthly distributed database is at the discretion of the
        ZEC,  however customarily contains echo names, moderator
        names and addresses, and descriptions of the echoes.

Zone  EchoList  Coordinator  -  Person   responsible   for   the
        maintenance and production of the Zone EchoList.

Q1
===================================================================
What is the purpose of this help file?

This  help file has been assembled as a means to provide answers
to  frequently  asked  questions  regarding  how  the   Backbone
operates   and   to   provide   an  insight  into  its  internal
administration.

Q2
===================================================================
FidoNews 12-32                 Page:  6                    07 Aug 1995

Who appoints the Hubs?

Hubs at the Zone level, commonly referred  to  as  "Stars",  are
appointed  by the O.B.O.  Hubs at the Region level are appointed
by  their  respective   Region   EchoMail   Coordinators.    The
appointment  of Hubs at the Net level is left up to local policy
to decide.

Q3
==================================================================
Are all of the echoes listed in Backbone.Na available  from  all
of the Hubs?

The Zone Hubs (Stars) make available all echoes which are listed
in Backbone.Na.  Region Hubs and Net Hubs are not  obligated  to
carry  all  listed echoes.  NO Hub is required to carry any echo
that, in their opinion, could subject them to consequences which
might have a negative effect on their well being.

Q4
==================================================================
What  are  the  responsibilities of a Moderator of an echo which
the North American Backbone carries?

    1)  Seeing that messages in their conference(s) correspond to
        the conference's theme.

    2)  Updating their conference(s) listing in the Echolist at least
        every six months.

    3)  To prevent the distribution of their conference(s) from
        interfering with the operation of the Backbone.

Q5 ==================================================================
What "tools" does the Backbone provide to a Moderator in
order to help him/her carry out their responsibilities?

If a Moderator believes that a node is violating a conference rule,
he/she may request the feed to that node be severed.  This
authorization is made in direct written form (netmail), to the Hub
feeding the offending node, with a copy to the offending node.

Q6 ===================================================================
What means does the Backbone use to recognize the Moderator
of a conference?

A Moderator is recognized as follows:

    1)  Upon formation of a conference, the person who forms the
        conference is the Moderator.

    2)  Upon resignation or replacement of an existing Moderator,
        the conference's rules define how the new Moderator is
        selected.

FidoNews 12-32                 Page:  7                    07 Aug 1995

    3)  Should a conference be without a moderator for over 30 days, the
        O.B.O. may cause a Moderator to be selected.

Q7
==================================================================
I am the moderator of a conference, but I may be  away  from  my
computer  for  long  periods  of  time.   What does the Backbone
suggest that I do to  ensure  that  my  conference  is  properly
maintained?

Moderators  are  encouraged  to  appoint Co-Moderators to assist
them in their duties and to stand in for them in their absence.

Q8
==================================================================
What is the Backbone's position on illegal activities  conducted
within EchoMail conferences?

The  Backbone does not distribute any conference which routinely
contains  messages  which   are   encrypted,   contain   illegal
information,  or  promote  illegal  activities.  As used in this
paragraph, "illegal activities" includes activities which are  a
violation  of civil law as well as activities which could result
in criminal prosecution.

The Backbone does not distribute any conference which  routinely
contains  counterfeit  messages.   A  counterfeit message is any
message entered using another person's  name,  handle,  or  node
address  with  the  intent  of  deceiving  others about the true
author of the message.

Q9
==================================================================
What is the Backbone's position on the  censorship  of  EchoMail
messages as they pass through the distribution system?

The  Backbone  does  not  permit  the  deletion or alteration of
messages as  they  are  distributed.   The  exceptions  to  this
provision  are  the deletion of messages, by any node, which may
lead to legal action against that node  or  which  do  not  meet
echomail message standards.

Q10
=================================================================
Regarding  echomail  standards, what standards does the Backbone
employ?

FTSC specifications FTS-0001 and  FTS-0004  are  followed.   All
Backbone nodes use the pathline option.

Q11
=================================================================
How  does  one  go about getting an echo added to North American
Backbone distribution?

FidoNews 12-32                 Page:  8                    07 Aug 1995

The O.B.O. generally adds a conference to the Backbone when  all
of these requirements are met:

    1)  The conference is listed in the Echolist.

    2)  The moderator sends a request to the O.B.O.  He/She
        should include a copy of the Echolist confirmation
        message if the conference does not appear in the
        currently published Echolist.

    3)  Two O.B.O council members recommend that the Backbone carry the
        conference to their regions.

Q12
=================================================================
When  does  the  Backbone  remove  an echo from its distribution
system?

The O.B.O. generally  drops  a  conference  when  any  of  these
situations occur:

1) The conference is not listed in the Echolist.

2)  Unconditionally when the moderator requests that the echo be
removed.

3) There are no longer two  O.B.O.  Council  members  requesting
    that the Backbone carry the conference to their regions.

4)   The   Moderator   fails   to   properly   carry   out   his
responsibilities.

5) The conference is without a Moderator for over 30 days.

6) The traffic level in the conference falls below  10  messages
    over a two month period.

7) When the O.B.O. considers that the distribution of an echo is
    no longer in the best interest of the Backbone.

Q13
=================================================================
How do Backbone nodes handle NetMail that lands on their systems
in the course of distributing EchoMail?

The  Backbone  encourages  the use of 'Echo routed NetMail' as a
means of keeping echo volume and off-topic posts to  a  minimum.
Backbone  nodes accept routed netmail from any node who connects
with  them  for  conferences.  Any  netmail   message   with   a
deliverable   destination  within  FidoNet,  regardless  of  its
origin,  is  accepted.   Routed  netmail  may  be  routed  along
echomail  paths  or  to a ZC, RC, or NC who has agreed to handle
such mail.

Routed  netmail  is  for  personal  messages.   It  is  not  for
FidoNews 12-32                 Page:  9                    07 Aug 1995

commercial  messages,  conferences,  mailing lists, news groups,
file-attaches,  "encoded"  files,  pyramid  letters,  or   chain
letters.

Q14
=================================================================
What does the Backbone expect of nodes who operate as "Gateways"
into and out of other domains?

Gateways must remove foreign distribution identifiers (including
seen-bys)  which  might adversely affect the distribution of the
conference on the Backbone. Gateways also pass netmail into  the
other network, unless it is technically impossible to do so.

Q15
=================================================================
What  obligation  does the Backbone have to those that desire to
get their EchoMail feed from it?

To strive to  distribute  EchoMail  in  the  most  accurate  and
expeditious manner possible within its means.

Although  the  North  American  Backbone attempts to provide the
best service possible, there is no guarantee of service provided.

It is operated by volunteers and is not obligated to handle  any
conference  that  could  take  the fun out of the hobby.  Use of
Backbone services should be viewed as a privilege, not a  right.
Messages  which  require sensitive or timely handling should not
be sent through the Backbone.

Q16
=================================================================
What is the update procedure for this document?

The O.B.O. may update this help file anytime that  he/she  feels
that  it would be in the best interest of the Backbone and those
people it voluntarily serves in order to more accurately reflect
its current operation.

                                    - end -

We are running a FLorida-wide Echo [FLA_COOKS] that deals
with cooking and eating throughout the state. Use of native
ingredients and regional specialties will be included as
well as restaurant reviews and anything else that pertains
to food in FLorida.

FLA_COOKS is Hubbed and Moderated by Christopher Baker at
1:374/14 in Titusville_FL, by Bert Sainz at 1:135/55 in
Miami_FL, and by Larry Squire at 1:3620/2 in St. Augustine
FL. Contact any for a link into this conference. It is also
being carried on the Region 18 Backbone at 1:3619/25.

That's the general idea. [grin]

The Echo tag is FLA_COOKS. In addition, FLorida systems
should have their FLorida city in their origin line so
everyone knows what part of FLorida you are talking about
and if you mention a specific place or area, you should
define it as if people outside your immediate area are
reading it [as they will be]. This ain't a 'local' Echo
anymore! [grin]

What If Dr. Seuss Did Technical Training Manuals?

Max & Don,

Here's a little ditty I came across today that I  thought  might
provide a smile.

         What If Dr. Seuss Did Technical Training Manuals?

          IF a packet hits a pocket on a socket on a port,
          And the bus is interrupted as a very last resort,
          And the address of the memory makes your floppy disk abort,
          Then the socket packet pocket has an error to report!

          IF your cursor finds a menu item followed by a dash,
          And the double-clicking icon puts your window in the trash,
          And your data is corrupted 'cause the index doesn't hash,
          Then your situation's hopeless, and your system's gonna
          crash!

          You can't say this?
          What a shame sir!
          We'll find you
          Another game sir.

          IF the label on the cable on the table at your house,
          Says the network is connected to the button on your mouse,
          But your packets want to tunnel on another protocol,
          That's repeatedly rejected by the printer down the hall,
          And your screen is all distorted by the side effects of gauss
          So your icons in the window are as wavey as a souse,
          Then you may as well reboot and go out with a bang,
          'Cause as sure as I'm a poet, the sucker's gonna hang!

          When the copy of your floppy's getting sloppy on the disk,
          And the microcode instructions cause unnecessary RISC,
FidoNews 12-32                 Page: 13                    07 Aug 1995

          Then you have to flash your memory and you'll want to RAM
          your ROM.
          Quickly turn off the computer and be sure to tell your MOM!

A QUESTION ABOUT RECs
By: Melle Koning, 2:281/705.29
Internet: melle@rtbbs.iaf.nl

I've got a question about Region Echomail Coordinators. Is a REC
allowed to disallow a conference-name because he wants to prevent
double-tags?

For example if a few people [nodes] want to route the echo SPORTS
between their nodes, but a conference with this name already exists,
can the REC somehow tell these nodes not to use this conference
name? And what if these nodes still don't want to change the name of
the area, can a REC use any pressure? Echopol doesn't answer this.

And what if a major link drops [because of some argument] and an
area breaks into two separate distribution conferences with the same
tag? Can a REC order one of the two to change the tag? Echopol
doesn't answer this either.

I hope someone can answer this or tell in fidonews if they ever
found themselves in this kind of situation, either as REC or as node
or as moderator or anything else :-) If you have an opinion about
this please let me know. [Yes I do have my own opinion about this
but first want to hear you guys.. :-)]

Thanks for reading,

    PUBLIC_KEYS and PKEY_DROP Echos on Zone 1 Backbone

The PUBLIC_KEYS Echo and PKEY_DROP Echo are available on the
Zone 1 Backbone.

The purpose of the Echos is to provide a place to post and
find public-keys for data privacy within FidoNet and
elsewhere and to discuss electronic signatures and data and
software encryption and the various schemes thereof.

[The rules below are a composite of the rules from each
Echo. See PUBKEYS.RUL and PKDROP.RUL in the current ELRUL
file for complete Guidelines for each Echo.]

These are technical Echos with very few rules. Those very few
rules are:

1. Stay on-topic. Topics of keys and privacy are welcome.
   Others are not.
2. No politics [except as it relates to privacy issues] and
   no religion.
3. No personal attacks, slurs or innuendo. Stick to issues
   not personalities.
4. No Private flagged messages in Echomail! PGP traffic
   using public-keys is permitted for the exercise so long
   as it is on-topic and anyone can read it.
5. This Echo may be traveling around the world so try to be
   concise. Avoid excessive quoting for one-liner responses.
6. Be aware that Echomail is NOT secure. Don't take anything
   at face value.
7. The posts in this Echo are the sole responsiblity of the
   poster. If you need verification, use Netmail.
8. The Moderators will deal with off-topic traffic. Don't
   respond for them. Links to this Echo will only be
   curtailed when absolutely necessary so please don't make
   it necessary. [grin]

The Moderators are Christopher Baker [KeyID: 2048/D881B549]
and GK Pace [KeyID: 2048/B604EBE9] at 1:374/14 and 1:374/26,
respectively.

It is recommended that public-keys be made available via
Netmail or by file-request with the magic filename: PGPKEY
and that the public-key provided for that request by given
a distinctive filename using part or all of each provider's
name and address. For example, on my system, a file-request
of PGPKEY will give BAK37414.ASC to the requesting system.
This will avoid duplicate overwriting and make it easier to
track the keys. Using a standard magic filename will make it
easier to find keys on different systems.

These Echos are on the Zone 1 Backbone. The PKEY_DROP Echo
FidoNews 12-32                 Page: 16                    07 Aug 1995

is for placing public-keys in circulation in a central area
available to all. This Echo has been EListed since ELIST211.
Please feel free to announce and distribute this Echo to all
interested participants in your area.

Make standard requests to your normal Backbone source for
these Echos and find out what we're doing. Join us in
discovering new possibilities.

"Pretty Good Privacy" MSDOS executables and source files for
porting to other platforms are available as PGP and PGPSRC
from this system and many others. Both archives were
hatched into the SDS in the SOFTDIST area and should be
available at an SDS site near you.

Thanks.

The Booke of Balde

Chapter the First

In the beginning, Tony created the heaven  and  the  earth.   He
created NZ_ECHO, and He created NZ_SYSOP.  He created George and
He created Daniel, that is also known as Raguel,  the  Vengeance
of  the  Lord.  And in the Garden of NZ_ECHO, he created a tree,
the tree of posts and the tree of moderation.  And He  gave  the
domain  of NZ_ECHO to Daniel.  And He gave the domain of hair to
George.

And Daniel did create in NZ_ECHO the first users, and they  were
named  Tim  and  Wendy, and Alan and Jeremy, and Ewen and Jenny.
And Tim and Wendy and Alan and Jeremy did become  tired  of  the
Vengeance of the Lord and did leave the Garden, saying "Yea, the
Vengeance of the Lord should Get a Life".  So that only Ewen and
Jenny were left.  And Ewen did desire to eat of the fruit of the
tree of moderation.  And Jenny did desire to eat of the fruit of
the tree of posts - in amounts overwhelming.

And  it  came about that Daniel and George espied their desires,
and said unto each other, "Let them not eat of the fruit of  the
tree  of  moderation,  lest  they  become like us, able to smite
users who deviate from the Proper Way  of  Doing  Things".   But
George  was jealous of Daniel, and secretly plotted against him.
He strove mightly, but George was an angel of few powers, as The
Lord  has  wisely  granted  him  but a little domain.  So George
created a vile instrument of his  envy,  a  Serpent,  with  many
heads.   And  the heads were numbered three, and they were named
Purity, Piety, and Chastity.  And he sent the Serpent down  into
the Garden.
FidoNews 12-32                 Page: 17                    07 Aug 1995


And  the  Serpent  spake  unto  Jenny.  First, the head known as
Chastity spoke, and Jenny was tempted by Chastity, but  refused.
Second,  the  head known as Purity spoke great wisdom, which was
incomprehensible to the inhabitants of the Garden, as  they  had
little  attention  spans,  after  long exposure to that language
which was common in the Garden at that time.   Third,  the  head
known  as  Piety  spoke, and the snake grew desperate, as it was
running out of heads, and therefore devised a cunning stratagem.
Yea,  it  spake  not  of  devotion  to  The  Lord,  Tony, but of
Fulfillment through the sin of Gluttony, and urged her to eat of
the  fruit of the tree of posts.  And it suceeded, and Jenny did
eat of the fruit of the tree of posts, in amounts  overwhelming.
And verily, she did share it with Ewen.

And  Daniel  was most displeased and was filled with wrath.  And
he did blame Ewen for the Fall of Jenny, and his  eye  did  fall
upon  the Serpent, and he did blame it for the Exodus of Tim and
Wendy and Alan and Jeremy. And he did say unto  Ewen  "Get  thee
gone  from the Garden, and take that bloody snake with you." And
Ewen's heart was heavy, for he had been Banished.  And he turned
to  leave,  and  Jenny  turned  to  leave  with  him, but Daniel
intervened, saying "That one can stay  -  she's  a  bit  of  all
right."

And, as the Serpent was brought low, and dragged from the Garden
on its belly, and the center head, that was  named  Purity  said
"What  the  hell  is  going  on  here?"  And Daniel did speak in
tongues.  And the Serpent spoke  again,  saying  "What  sort  of
reply  is  that,  for I can make neither heads, nor tail of it".
And Daniel did speak again, but only  unto  the  head  that  was
named  Purity, saying "I have laid thee low upon thy belly, such
that the only way that thou mayst rise from the  dust  in  which
thou  dost crawl is to apply your flicking serpentine tongues to
my buttocks with exceptional vigour.  And that's my last word on
the matter."

And the head named Chastity said "That's alright, for I have two
gardens of my own".  And added the head named Purity,  "So  have
I", and Piety declared "As do we all!"

Some  time passed.  And the Serpent did wander for a time.  And,
on passing the Garden of Daniel, the  Serpent  did  notice  that
there  were holes in the wall of the Garden, and it did poke its
head named Chastity through one  of  these  holes,  and  lo!   A
strange  sight  greeted  it.  For, during the time of wandering,
Jenny had grown lonely, with noone else to talk to.  And  Daniel
had created for her a new race of users, with exceptionally long
and supple tongues, and they were named David  and  Samuel,  and
Jamie  and  David.   And  the  sound  of  many  tongues slapping
vigorously upon buttocks was heard throughout the land.

Silly submission, eh
From: John Beveridge (1:252/140)

What have we here, Martha?  BOFAQ508.TXT?  huh?   What kind of
silliness is this?

        Q3 ========================================================
        Are all of the echoes listed in Backbone.Na available
        from all of the Hubs?

        The Zone Hubs (Stars) make available all echoes which are
        listed in Backbone.Na.  Region Hubs and Net Hubs are not
        obligated to carry all listed echoes.  NO Hub is required
        to carry any echo that, in their opinion, could subject
        them to consequences which might have a negative effect
        on their well being.

"Their well being" could very well mean anything at all.  Sort of like
"the pursuit of happiness" or some such.

        Q8 ========================================================
        What is the Backbone's position on illegal activities
        conducted within EchoMail conferences?

        The Backbone does not distribute any conference which
        routinely contains messages which are encrypted, contain
        illegal information, or promote illegal activities.  As
        used in this paragraph, "illegal activities" includes
        activities which are a violation of civil law as well as
        activities which could result in criminal prosecution.

Geezus, whatever happened to "well being"?

        The Backbone does not distribute any conference which
        routinely contains counterfeit messages.  A counterfeit
        message is any message entered using another person's
        name, handle, or node address with the intent of deceiving
        others about the true author of the message.

        Q9 ========================================================
        What is the Backbone's position on the censorship of
        EchoMail messages as they pass through the distribution
        system?

        The Backbone does not permit the deletion or alteration
        of messages as they are distributed.  The exceptions to
        this provision are the deletion of messages, by any node,
        which may lead to legal action against that node or which
        do not meet echomail message standards.

Does this mean that we can also delete any message that comes close to
messing with our "well being"?   Probably does and there doesn't seem
to be too much that the Old Boys Organization and/or the Old Boys
Organization Council can do about it.  After all, our "well being" or
FidoNews 12-32                 Page: 19                    07 Aug 1995

some such is at stake here.  Isn't it?

Thanks.....

SKEPTIC Echo on the Zone 1 Backbone!

Rights On!, 1:374/14

             SKEPTIC Echo is alive and well!

SKEPTIC is a Backbone Echo that originally sprang forth
from the San Francisco area. It now originates from Zone 3
in Hawthorndene, Australia under the Moderatorship of Jackson
Harding at 3:800/857. Co-Moderator is David Bloomberg in
Springfield, IL at 1:2430/2112.

If any of you or your Sysops are interested in obtaining
this Echo, you or they should contact their regular,
Backbone Echo source! SKEPTIC has appeared in FIDONET.NA
[now BACKBONE.NA} since 2 May 92.

SKEPTIC is devoted to examination and report of paranormal
and fringe-science claims. It has NO official or unofficial
connection to CSICOP {Committee for the Scientific
Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal} but has a similar
philosophy. Claims are not rejected on a priori grounds but
rather are investigated by objective and critical inquiry.

The Echo is now fully activated and waiting for those with
an interest in the mission stated above.

Complete information about the Echo may be found in the
current issue of the EList and the ELRules files.

these activities are just amusing and some are dangerous to the liberty
of anyone who doesn't subscribe to their particular brand of socially
acceptable lunacy.

Take the case of Salman Rushdie, for example. Here's a perfectly
average writer who points out a few foibles and suddenly has an actual
death order out against him because he supposedly 'blasphemed' a
mainstream monotheism's god. This might be funny if it weren't for the
sobering fact that there are plenty of deranged individuals who would
be happy to kill Mr. Rushdie for this victimless 'crime'. Can't happen
here, I hear you cry? Wanna bet? It wouldn't be the first time.

American Atheists Online Services is now Hosting an Echo to call
attention to the zany and disturbing activities of all kinds of
theists without regard to mainstream or fringe affiliations. This Echo
is called THEIST_WATCH and that's just what it does.

It is READ-ONLY except to non-theist persons wishing to post actual
news items. It is NOT a religion debate Echo. [That's what HOLYSMOKE is
for.] It is not a bashing Echo. It is a forum for the dissemination of
information about the activities of theists in the public arena;
particularly where those activities encroach upon the separation of
state and church.

It is now a Zone 1 Backbone Echo Hosted & Moderated from AAOS [American
Atheist Online Services] at 1:382/1006 in Austin_TX, by Robin
Murray-O'Hair. Anyone may Areafix it from their Backbone feed as of
15 Jan 95.

The THEIST_WATCH rules are available in the current issue of the ELIST
and have since ELIST501. File-request the current ELIST from your local
Backbone source for instructions on the Echo's operation.

Also available from AAOS is the AAOS Echo. This is a Backbone
distributed Echo for members or prospective members of American
Atheists, Inc. AAOS Echo may be obtained from the source at 1:382/1006
or from the alternate feed at 1:374/14. Send Netmail with session and
Areafix passwords to the feed of your choice for a link.

AAOS Echo contains atheist news and information as well as providing a
direct link to American Atheists.

If you are interested in keeping up with the shennanigans of the theist
community, Areafix THEIST_WATCH from your Backbone source today!

TTFN.
