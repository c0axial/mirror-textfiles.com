                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================


     I have had _one_ complaint that a submitted article via E-Mail has
     been unreceived, even though the submittor has indicated that the
     article has been sent twice now to the "editor@fidonews.org" address.

     Contrary to popular opinion, the FidoNews web site is operated by a
     third party, and not directly under the control of the Editor.

     We have not ascertained if the problem is on this end or that end,
     but....

     If anyone else has had similar problems, please send me a note to
     one of the other E-Mail addresses, or submit the article via netmail
     so we can be sure to print what is actually received.  The addresses
     are listed below in the masthead information area at the end of the
     issue.

     I would appreciate the information, so that it can be forwarded to
     Jim Barchuk, who operates the web site at his own expense.

     And, if I haven't done this before, I'll thank Jim for his assistance
     in making FidoNews available to the world.

     In other news, the battle to wrest control of the EchoMail Listing
     has now moved into high gear, with the RECC all but demanding that
     the Z1C choose a particular system.

     Odd how this came out immediately after the existance of other ELIST
     systems was announced in the FidoNews.

     One would think that a more prudent RECC would look at all of the
     possibile systems before settling on one...or is this just another
     jab at the ZEC, and the RECC refusal to work with him?

     More odd that the RECC would claim that the ZEC is supposedly to
     'moderate and present' to the RECC, but then turns around to lock
     the ZEC out of discussions, then claim that the ZEC is not doing
     his assigned duties.

     But then, these are also the same people who present in their
     erstwhile ultimatum to the Z1C that they wish the ELIST process to be
     above politics, while using the same proposed system as a political
     tool.

     How so very interesting.

     =================================================================

     RESPONSE TO EDITORIAL IN FIDONEWS DATED 22 JUNE 1998

     By Ben Hamilton, FidoNet 1:124/7008

     This letter is in response to the editorial that was included in the
     FidoNews issue on June 22, 1998.

     Before I begin, I anticipate again being accused of selective
     quoting.  To remind the readers, my reasoning for such quoting is
     simple.  Since I have personal knowledge of only some of the comments
     made by the editor, it is only proper that I respond to only those
     comments.  The items that I select will be the ones to which I have
     personal knowledge.  The editor is free to state whatever views he
     likes on the other issues, regardless of accuracy, as far as I am
     concerned, as I have no way to counter information that I myself have
     not witnessed and verified.

     In response to the editor's opinion that the RECs have posted the
     results of the no-confidence vote, then refused to reveal the
     particulars, I can only say this:  The ZEC duties, as written by
     Bob Kohl, approved by the RECs, and then recognized by the ZC, state
     the "charges" quite clearly.

        >>  If the RECC concludes that the ZEC is not active,  <<
        >>  ineffective in his/her job or is just not taking   <<
        >>  care his/her responsibilities; they may take a     <<
        >>  vote of no-confidence.                             <<

     The RECC charges that the ZEC is inactive, ineffective in his job,
     and is not taking care of his responsibilities.

     These are the charges.  They are very simple.  The basis for them is
     also simple.  One just has to turn it around the other way.  How
     *has* he been active?  How *has* he been effective?  How *has* he
     been taking care of his responsibilities?

     As I must continually remind you because the editor keeps asking,
     Kohl's first act after winning the ZEC election was to ask the RECC
     how he should go about removing an NEC from office.  He did remove
     the NEC.  He soon removed an NC.  His REC quit, saying that he could
     no longer stand working with Kohl.  He disclosed some in-transit
     netmail.

     Are these the actions of a active, effective, responsible ZEC?  Can
     you honestly say "yes" in good conscience?

     The editor states again and again that Kohl was the first person to
     be elected to a zone position by a sysop-level vote.  I urge all
     sysops who voted for him to come forward!  Let your NECs and RECs
     know that you feel Kohl has been active, effective, and responsible
     and how.  Please be specific.  And if a sysop-level vote is so great,
     why was the recent R10C election only an NC-level vote?
     FIDONEWS 15-26               Page 3                   29 Jun 1998


     The editor goes on to state that answers in "his own situation" are
     "forthcoming."  Answers?  That would be refreshing.

     Included in this issue of FidoNews should be an announcement that the
     RECC has approved of Thom LaCosta as the new "EchoList."  So much for
     politics.

     cc: Bob Satti, Thom LaCosta

     On behalf of the RECC, I would like to strongly suggest that you
     assign Thom Lacosta, 1:261/1352, a zone level aka under the username
     "Echolist" as soon as reasonably possible, and we further request
     that you use the address 1:1/21 for the following reasons.

     First, to differentiate Thom's elist software from that formerly
     operated by Adrian Walker.

     Secondly, to avoid any implication that the Echolist system is
     operating under the auspices and control of anyone other than
     yourself.  Thom is adamant that he remain totally away from any
     Fidonet politics and/or control and specific distribution systems,
     and we, the RECC, feel this would bethe best choice, which is similar
     to what is in place for FidoNews at 1:1/23.

     And thirdly, Thom's echobase software is being strongly supported by
     those it strives to serve, the moderators, with over 300
     registrations to date (I am told).

     Thank you for listening to us, and we do urge you to grant this
     request as soon as possible.

     Dear Editorbeing,

     This article is submitted by Doc Logger who was still in a
     fever delirium, having contracted strep throat somewhere in
     the wilds of Cape Breton. Heath care advice in that part of
     the world consists of "Drink more whiskey" which is their
     universal panacea for ailments.

     Roll da flic Zorch.....

     Dear Reverend Visage,

     I've just returned from a hellish holiday in the wilds of
     Eastern Canada. What started out as a simple trip to deliver
     some artwork and make free with a few lobsters ended up
     being a "Vanishing Point" sort of dash for the Ontario
     border. I would have returned sooner except for the fact
     that when the nitro methanol finally melted the turbo
     injection blades in Prince Edward Island, the mechanic who
     worked at the Anne of Green Gables Lobster Take-Out & Auto
     repairs had no clue how to fix it. Fortunately, the airport
     experienced one of its three annual days when it wasn't
     fogged in and they were able to deliver both the right part
     and a competent mechanic to fix it. The mechanic, after he
     noted the damage to the engine wondered if I might consider
     lowering the nitro methanol mixture in the fuel just a
     tadge. He completely understood my position however, when I
     explained that shooting five meter, quad contrails of blue
     flame was the only effective remedy for keeping harelipped
     Quebecers from tail-gating.

     It was 3am last night when I finally crossed the New
     Brunswick border leading a procession of provincial and
     federal police cars. It seems that it is illegal to make a
     right turn on a red light in the backward eastern provinces
     and the flashing lights and ugly demeanour of the pursuing
     cops was clear evidence that they did not intend to allow my
     crimes to go unpunished. Fortunately, they broke off the
     chase when I entered Quebec because they'd all forgotten
     their passports which would have permitted them entry into
     the newly constituted Republic of Poutine. By the time I
     reached Ontario my fever was holding at a steady 104 and the
     odometer was locked at about twice that number.

     I see that I didn't miss much in my absence. It seems that
     Bob "Noted" Satti turned down Mangold's policy complaint
     because Satti could find no proof that Kohl had revealed the
     contents. Satti is entirely too stupid to grasp the obvious
     or to poll any of the other possibilities on the mail path.
     Since Kohl has been "elected" R10C, the odious little cretin
     FIDONEWS 15-26               Page 6                   29 Jun 1998


     is back to posting his illiterate nonsense in the Z1C echo.
     The good news is that he has garnered the support of Belcke
     in his attempt to counter the actions of the RECC. Belcke is
     not noted for the subtlety of his mind, nor for recognizing
     inappropriate behaviour.

     In SnoozNews, it is the height of hilarity to see that his
     Zorchness ponder about questions asked and unanswered in his
     editorial. Since I like to follow the bouncing ball as much
     as the next person, here's a question for Zorch:

     Did you vote twice in the ZEC election?

     I can't wait to see His Zorchness weasel his way past an
     answer to that question as he happily attempts to defend
     poor dimwitted Kohl. I also note  that his Zorchness sent
     out a questionaire to a few sysops asking if their RECs
     consulted them with respect to the censure vote which went
     against Kohl. For the record, Region 12 was consulted by the
     R12EC and the responses were universal in their support of
     the RECC to censure Kohl.

     In more Kohl news, I see that Kohl has suggested to Ruth
     Argust that she is being excessively annoying by repeating
     the true story about Kohl's pathetic attempts to get free
     boarding for his horse. Our prayers and our edible underwear
     should go out to Kohl in his hours of confusion.

     That pretty well wraps the fish on this article. I don't
     have a pithy quote this week because almost all of my
     reading has been road signs. Which reminds me, what sort of
     deranged and evil mind in New Brunswick dreamed up the idea
     of roadside garbage pails? I mean, these aren't just little
     buckets by the side of the road, hell no. They have their
     own off ramp, on ramp, and ten  kilometers worth of signage
     warning you that you are fast approaching a road side
     garbage pail. Now, you'd think that with the money they
     could at least have tucked a washroom beside the garbage
     pails, but no, just a forlorn garbage pail. Anyway, my
     apologies to New Brunswick. It was me. I peed in your
     garbage pails, damnit, and I'd do it again if I had to.

     I must go Visage, the shipping company from Prince Edward
     Island just phoned and I'll have to supervise the
     installation of the 300 foot concrete lobster on your front
     lawn. You'll appreciate its splendour when you get back and
     thank me for it.

     Regards,
     Doc Logger,
     Far Eastern Veteran,
     Furlang Island, South Pacific
