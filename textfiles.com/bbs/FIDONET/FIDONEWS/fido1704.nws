                                   Bullies
                                  Doug Myers

     Sunday Morning I received an article from "Mike" (full name not
     given) on "The Bullies of Fidonet."  It's an article I don't fully
     agree with - but since Fidonews should be open to all viewpoints, I
     publish it without regret.  The free press nature of Fidonews,
     however, does not prevent me (nor anyone else) from presenting an
     opinion on the issue, however.

     First of all, I sympathize with Mike in his plight.  I would imagine
     that he really is receiving all the unkind messages he says he is.
     I'm not following the particular conferences he cites nor the
     discussion in progress, but the arguments between pro-life and
     pro-choice on abortion matters isn't exactly new nor confined to the
     conferences on Fidonet.  My own experience has been that both
     extreme positions in this argument have accumulated their share of
     unreasonable proponents so that rational public discussion is
     impossible.

     What's unclear from Mike's account is how much he contributed to
     situation which led to his bannings and heated responses.  I
     wouldn't expect him to report that he went into the discussions with
     an attitude and drew response in kind from his counterparts on the
     other extreme of the issue, but it does seem more reasonable a
     scenario that that he joined the conference posting sweetness and
     light and received personal attacks from the forces of evil.

     Here are two areas where Mike's case against Fidonet is clearly
     weak, though.  (1) He holds Fidonet Sysops and Moderators
     responsible for controlling messages he finds offensive, and (2) he
     threatens legal action.

     If the decline of Fidonet is predicated on Sysops and Moderators
     controlling messages to the extent of not offending anyone, then we
     may as well throw in the towel now.  Folks can take offense at
     _anything_ and frequently do.  Controlling ones own reaction to
     offense has always been necessary for public interaction, and is
     hardly new to Fidonet.  I doubt that this requirement has led to the
     decline of Fido.

     Yes, moderators have taken steps over the years to restrict posting
     which goes out of its way to be offensive, but the effort is
     normally directed towards the smooth flow of conversation in the
     echo.  Participants who take offense frequently to the statements of
     others and expect moderator action in each case have frequently
     found themselves removed from the conference on the basis that their
     complaints are just as disruptive as the offensive posting.  Which
     is worse:  one who goes out of his way to be offensive, or one who
     goes out of his way to be offended?

     FIDONEWS 17-04               Page 2                   24 Jan 2000


     Threatening legal action is the lowest form of echo behavior, in my
     opinion.  First of all, it is seldom seriously intended nor
     practical and, as such, is only intended as bluff and bravado.
     However, it's the biggest conversation killer around.  What echo
     participant would want to cope with legal action over conversations
     which are supposed to be a pastime?  Defending against even a
     trivial legal matter would impose more expense and time demands on
     an individual than he is willing to devote to the hobby.  In my
     opinion, threatened legal action gives any moderator or sysop the
     right to drop the threatener.

     Fidonet does need ways to cope with the fact that there are going to
     be less BBSes in the future.  Unlike many of the optimists, I don't
     think that trend is going to reverse... though I think Fido can
     survive with a smaller nodelist.  However, I don't think the
     discussion is enhanced by taking up every grudge which comes down
     the pike.  Sorry, Mike, but I think you're going to have to come to
     terms with the moderators and sysops you're arguing with on your
     own.  I don't think you'll muster "Fidonet" behind you.

                           Who's Out There Lurking?
                              philip@crookes.org

     Doug,

     Here's an e-mail I wrote in reply to Lesley-Dee's article in the
     last issue of Snooze. As you'll see, I used to be a Fido sysop, now
     I just browse the Snooze and wonder what if? As I noted to
     Lesley-Dee, you too may do what you will with these words, in a
     spectrum ranging from pulling the chain to publishing far and wide.
     Whatever you do will be right.

     Incidentally, did you know that the richest man in New Zealand is
     called Doug Myers?

     the words follow


     Lesley-Dee


     Like you, like many, I used to be in FidoNet. I joined up somewhere
     in the mid to late 80s, first as 2:253/197, later as 2:250/102 and
     later still as a node in the German Zone 24 but I forgot the number.

     At its peak I ran Merkinstead, a UK and later German BBS that scored
     upwards of 10,000 hits a month for its mix of attitude, e-mail,
     echoes, a real mean AI engine, downloads delivered by a Hairy
     Protocol and (then the wonder of the age) a unique online interface
     to the broadcast database that is European teletext.

     So why stop?

     I moved house, country and job. I became less and less patient with
     tiny-minded men with names like Keith Wassell and Ron Dwight (back
     then respectively *Cs in Region 25 and Zone 2). It's no coincidence
     that *C sounds-like STASI - the acronym of the loathsome East German
     spying & secret police outfit.

     I miss the great cameraderie -  the monthly meets at the Barleycorn
     pub in West Didsbury in Manchester, England; the phone calls about
     some new discovery; the shared purchases of new exciting gear.

     The fact that when I joined Fido a sysop called Phil Burden could be
     bothered to put up with my 13 unsuccessful attempts to e-mail his
     system before I got it right... and then he replied with the desired
     node number.

     There was the time that Dave Thorpe found somewhere somehow the
     close-out stock of some company and we all bought unimagineably big
     192 MB hard disks. And wondered how we could ever fill them with
     FIDONEWS 17-04               Page 4                   24 Jan 2000


     downloads and gateway programs.

     The time I got hold of a CD ROM drive and managed to belabor it into
     working with my Amstrad PC1512 computer with its 8086 CPU and
     incredible 640K of RAM to create what I boasted was 'one of Fido's
     biggest file troughs'. It probably wasn't but the files.bbs list
     alone was 100K long...

     The very first time someone called my BBS, pulled the rope to ring
     the bell and as the rope came away in their hand was greeted by our
     Butler: 'a tall, cadaverous man who sways slightly as he welcomes
     you to the House. Some people say he drinks so much because he has
     forgotten his Real Name - or is it just that he has forgotten his
     Name because he drinks so much?"

      I miss the shared pleasure of devising new toys for the BBS. The
     great spirit of discovery that led John Clempner to write and
     present to Merkinstead the software to display teletext (a closed
     captioning database of about 20 MB per tv channel) without even
     seeing the tv card in my computer. Or Simon Dowson, who created the
     AI engine that allowed our online Ngaire to give astonishingly
     believable answers to caller's questions - and even led one
     unfortunate lovesick lad to call the house line and insist to my
     astonished wife that she must allow him to pledge his troth to the
     lovely Ngaire at once!

     Merkinstead.com will, one day soon, reappear on the Internet,
     together with radio station 2BGR (for Bloody Good Radio) which I
     don't suppose we could ever have achieved with the Fido technology
     of the time. And when it does, no whining weasel Wassells, no
     drivelling dweebly Dwights, will tell me what to put up, which
     messages I may carry, who I may allow to come onto my property. And
     if Keith Wassell or Ron Dwight don't like these words, I invite them
     or any other *C to discuss the question with me keyboard to keyboard
     at philip@crookes.org. Attorneys at thirty paces!

     Fido's strength was its friendship, anarchy, common purpose and
     shared sense of exploration. Its weakness was and is the whole crap
     and bullshit of Policy - (since when does English give capital
     letters to plain ornery words?) and the unnecessary power structure
     inherent in the *C system. Fido needs exactly as much Policy as does
     the Internet. No less, no more. But it won't happen because the boys
     won't let go of the toys until one day the nursery will be empty and
     no-one will care any more. If anyone cares now.

     So long as anyone can de-list a Fido node, Fido is doomed. So long
     as the Nodelist entry is conditioned on anything other than purely
     technical grounds, Fido will die. Because even though I pay people
     money for my DNS listing, nobody is telling me what I may do with
     it. Not to mention that the Internet is bigger, better connected,
     cheaper to do and more fun.

     You're free to do what you like with this outpouring of
     sentimentality and drivel. Print it, dump it, shred it, feed it to
     the cat. Even put it through Merkinstead's Mincing Machine (tho it
     may well hit you with its handbag if you do!)

     But, like Fido used to be and stopped being, it was fun while it
     lasted.

                            THE BULLIES OF FIDONET
                      "Mike" <chasers1@intergrafix.net>


     In this "Open Letter",  I would like to call attention to the
     problem of certain resident "bullies" who presently prowl Fidonet.
     Just how does one defend against such cyberspace bullies within the
     confines of Fidonet?  Not too effectively, I'm sorry to say.   In
     this letter, I will name only people who I have interacted with
     favorable.  Anyone that I accuse of any improper conduct has NOT
     been named herein because it is not my intent to further involve
     FidoNet into the dispute.

     My first experience with Fidonet was with Airpower BBS in the
     Philadelphia metropolitan area and it's sysop, Jim Henry, who is one
     of the few conscientious and fair sysops I've met in cyberspace.
     Upon discovering the Abortion conference; and making known my
     pro-life position I quickly found the Moderator of that conference
     very biased against anyone who held a view contrary to hers.   The
     moderator, on a "bad hair day" unfairly and arbitrarily dismissed me
     from the conference because of my religious views.  A series of
     ongoing insulting and defamatory messages ensued in the conference
     after I was booted and I began responding to each writer via net
     mail to correct misinformation.

     And, she was not the only one with that attitude in the conference.
     As a result, most of the real pro-life people in that conference
     left, even though the conference was taken over by a new moderator
     who I believe is a paper Christian/pro-lifer.  Some time later, that
     Moderator who I believe was fully aware of the unfairness afforded
     me by his predecessor allowed me back into the conference.
     Unfortunately, the new moderator did not have the confidence to run
     the conference without intimidation and control from some of the
     senior pro-babykilling members of the conference. When a dispute
     arose between myself and one of the other members of the conference
     about his sending me offensive, blasphemous and religiously
     harassing messages in the conference, addressed to me personally the
     offending person voluntarily agreed to stop posting such messages.
     A little while later, the same person again began using the
     offensive post to me, knowing full well that I was offended by it
     because of it's blasphemous content.

     It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that some "old
     timer" pro-abortion people in the conference who didn't want the
     pro-life message to get too much exposure could figure out what a
     "fence teetering" moderator would do if he got into a serious legal
     jam. After I agreed to stop posting my messages to the perp who was
     sending me the harassing, blasphemous messages; and without ever
     ordering said perp to stop posting to me, the moderator booted me
     from the abortion conference.  Shortly thereafter I began
     complaining (mostly by private messages) to people who were defaming
     FIDONEWS 17-04               Page 7                   24 Jan 2000


     me in the Abortion conference.  I also notified the moderator and
     several members of the conference that I would sue them for their
     tortious acts against me.

     The "perp" after being warned by the moderator of the Bible
     conference about his messages to and about me left the Bible
     conference and went over to "Holysmoke" where he began posting
     untrue statements about me and the long standing dispute.  I filed a
     cease and desist message defending myself in that conference and
     specifically avoiding engaging in any discussions with anyone in
     Holysmoke.

     Many of the obnoxious people in Holysmoke who frequent that
     conference solely to be obnoxious began, along with the "perp" to
     post sexually harassing, religiously harassing,
     defamatory/slanderous/libelous messages to and about me on
     Holysmoke, a public and international conference.  After attempts to
     reach the Moderator of Holysmoke failed, I contacted the sysop of
     the BBS system that the perp was posting from (and the sysops of
     others sending such messages) requesting that they control these
     persons sending the unsolicited, unwanted, harassing, defamatory
     /slanderous/libelous messages and cause them to cease and desist.
     One of these people sending such messages was himself a sysop and a
     major hub on Fidonet who retaliated by contacting my sysops to get
     my access cut.

     The perp contacted the new moderator of the Abortion conference for
     help; and that moderator sent false information to the sysop of  the
     perp intended to convice the sysop that I was the person in the
     wrong.  That sysop, who was also one of my sysops, then cut my
     access to his board; and presumably without controlling the perp.
     In fact, that sysop did a trace to determine what my ISP was for
     telnetting to his board and then published that information in the
     Holysmoke conference, presumably to enable some of the more vicious
     posters in that conference to harass me further.

     The messages I get from the sysops, (one in particular) is that he
     and the other posters have the right to say whatever they want to
     say and send it in messages to me any time they want and that I have
     to be a captive audience for such messages.  That is to say that
     they have every right to send me messages (even after I demand that
     they cease and desist) containing defamatory/slanderous/libelous
     accusations that I have sex with dogs, that I suck ****, and similar
     and more vulgar accusations together with blasphemous and horrible
     things said about my Lord Jesus Christ, His Mother, Catholics and
     Christians in general.

     I think my sysop, Jim Henry is an upright guy; but I also think the
     present organization of Fidonet leaves him little choice about
     backing up one of his subscribers against the group of cyber-bullies
     that presently roam Fido-Net.........some of them sysops themselves.
     I went to the sysops of the perps and even advised them of the law
     of the matter with the result that two of them refused to act, one
     of them asserted his right to do whatever he wanted and one of them
     booted me from his bulletin board.

     FIDONEWS 17-04               Page 8                   24 Jan 2000


     The "death rattles" of Fidonet have been in the air for quite some
     time; and I hardly think that such gross, manifest unfairness is
     going to help Fidonet survive.  Do I WANT to sue sysops, FidoNet and
     other people?  Certainly not!  I think FidoNet serves a very useful
     purpose in cyberspace; and I think there are very many talented and
     dedicated people serving FidoNet.  One FidoNet person who responded
     quickly to my request for help was Fane; and I think that if all of
     Fidonets members conducted themselves as he did, Fidonet's chances
     of survival would be greatly enhanced.

     I am not the kind of person who will sit back and send me
     emails/messages posts which contain the line "Jesusonacid@yahoo.com"
     or other malicious insults to my religion.  Sure, you arguably might
     have the right to say that in public when nobody is around; or when
     someone is around who doesn't object.  However, in the face of
     repeated objection you have no right to force me to be a captive
     audience for your awful posts or your defamation/slander/libel or
     harassment.

     Fidonet, this is the writing on the wall.  I thank the sysops and
     posters who supported me in this matter; and I sincerely hope that
     someone in Fidonet might take this message to heart.  I would
     respectfully remind all of you sysops of a major rule of Fidonet:
     1.2.1.1 (Users):  The sysop is responsible for the actions of any
     user when they affect the rest of Fidonet.  (If a user is annoying,
     the sysop is annoying.) Any traffic entering FidoNet via a given
     node, if not from the sysop, is considered to be from a user and is
     the responsibility of the sysop. (See section 2.1.3).

                                 Is It Dying?
                           Frank Vest, 1:124/6308.1



     Ok folks. Y2K has come and gone. It's time to move onward and
     upward. I must admit to some concern regarding Y2K. I wondered if my
     system would survive and how many, if any, of the other Fidonet
     Nodes would survive. As it turned out, I made it and many more as
     well.

                                 Ok, so what?

                                I'll tell ya!

     Since I survived and Fidonet survived, it's time to get Fidonet into
     the 21st century. Yeah, I know that the 21st century doesn't start
     for another year, but that doesn't matter to me and shouldn't to
     you. Darrell Salter wrote a "thoughts" article in one Fidonews. I
     respect Darrell and agree with some of what he said. We will let
     Fidonet die if we don't do something. Darrell is after the internet
     side and changes to P4. I applaud him for that. Me, I want the other
     FIDONEWS 17-04               Page 9                   24 Jan 2000


     side. Telnet is fine. I have no problems with those that want to go
     that route. I just like the dial up idea. P4 works for me and that's
     fine. If it changes, I'll deal with that as well. Heck, I'm easy.
     (did I say that? :-)

     So, where does that leave us and what the heck are you talking
     about?

     Simple. Promote Fidonet. I don't really care how, just as long as
     it's positive. I've heard all the negative I care to. It's time to
     go positive.

                        Ok, How do we promote Fidonet?

     Well, we could all take out ads and spend lots of money on
     commercials and stuff like that...... Hmmm, I guess not. :)  This is
     a hobby and, as such, most of us don't have or aren't willing to
     spend lots of money promoting. So what do we do?

     Geesh! Here's a road map. :)

     1. Talk about your BBs to friends or other people you get into idle
        conversation with.
      a. If you're not a Sysop, do the same thing about the BBS(s) that
         you like.

     2. Are you on the Internet? Gotta web page?
      a. Put a small page up for your BBS, or add a page on your site.
      b. Plug your BBS in the appropriate Newsgroups.
       1. Don't like Newsgroups? Don't read them! Just post to them. :)
          (do you think the spammers read the groups they post to? :)

     3. You're not a Sysop but have a web page?
      a. Put a link to your favorite BBS' page or to a BBS site.

     4. You're at your favorite computer store. Ask the manager if you
        can put some fliers in the store with BBS numbers and "how to
        connect" information. (of course, you need to print some fliers.
        :)

     I'm sure there are other ways to promote BBS' and Fidonet. These are
     just some "off the top of my head thoughts".

                      In the "For What It's Worth area"

     I put a small post in the "general" newsgroup for my area
     (Dallas/Ft. Worth) and snagged three people off the web. One left me
     a nice note that read, <paraphrased> I thought that all the BBS' in
     DFW were gone. Now, wasn't that a kick. :)  The ad wasn't fancy, big
     or anything like that. The whole post was as follows:

     - start

     Collin Country Station BBS is open and waiting for new Users.  We
     have Message areas, Games and other things of interest.

     FIDONEWS 17-04               Page 10                  24 Jan 2000


     Dallas Metro Number is 972-562-8064

     Don't know what a BBS is? Check out the Web Page at
     http://texoma.net/~flv

     There is more out there that the Internet and AOL

     - end

     I'm gonna pull BBS'ing and Fidonet back into the light. You can do
     what you will. If Fidonet and BBS'ing die, it won't be from lack of
     effort on my part.  What are you going to do?!?

     Oh yeah! If you don't have a BBS in your area, start one. If you do
     have a BBS, promote it. :)

     Have fun. Call a BBS. Enjoy life!

                             Boy Becomes SomeBody

     A man is waiting for wife to give birth. The doctor comes in and
     informs the dad that his son was born without torso, arms or legs.
     The son is just a head! But the dad loves his son and raises him as
     well as he can, with love and compassion.

     After 21 years, the son is old enough for his first drink. Dad takes
     him to the bar and tearfully tells the son he is proud of him. Dad
     orders up the biggest, strongest drink for his boy.

     With all the bar patrons looking on curiously and the bartender
     shaking his head in disbelief, the boy takes his first sip of
     alcohol. Swoooop! A torso pops out!

     The bar is dead silent; then bursts into a whoop of joy. The father,
     shocked, begs his son to drink again. The patrons chant "Take
     another drink"! The bartender still shakes his head in dismay.
     Swoooop! Two arms pops out.

     The bar goes wild. The father, crying and wailing, begs his son to
     drink again. The patrons chant "Take another drink"! The bartender
     ignores the whole affair. By now the boy is getting tipsy, and with
     his new hands he reaches down, grabs his drink and guzzles the last
     of it. Swoooop! Two legs pop out.

     The bar is in chaos. The father falls to his knees and tearfully
     thanks God.

     The boy stands up on his new legs and stumbles to the left.... then
     to the right.... right through the front door, into the street,
     where a truck runs over him and kills him instantly.

     The bar falls silent. The father moans in grief. The bartender sighs
     and says, "That boy should have quit while he was a head."

     sent on to other nodes, or available to be sent onward,
     defined in minutes. A latency of ! implies that there is an
     immediate response, and an attempt to deliver immediately
     after processing, or a "MinuteMail System", as it were.
