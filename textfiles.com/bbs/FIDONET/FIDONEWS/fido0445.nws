                        Standards?  What Standards?


     I'm  going  to break one of my standing rules here.  I'm going to
     talk from the perspective  of  a  software  publisher.  Well,  to
     roughly  quote  Captain Jean-Luc Picard,  "Life itself is no more
     than a mass of exceptions."

     A year ago there was this thing called  the  "FidoNet  Protocol".
     It  was  even  documented.  The  idea  was to promulgate a public
     domain standard for electronic mail.  The basic idea was sound, I
     think.  It got a lot of good attention from a lot of  people  for
     awhile.   I've   spoken   with   people   who  were  planning  on
     implementing it for Telex, Compuserve, BIX,  MCI Mail,  and a lot
     of other services.  Not to mention,  of course, the "real" target
     of people writing mailers  for  Ataris,  Commodore  64s,  and  so
     forth.  It was a concrete spec with a fairly wide acceptance, and
     it made a good, solid target to work at.

     Oh, it wasn't perfect.  We all knew that.  Since when is anything
     ever  perfect?  But people were working on ways to beef it up and
     make it cleaner.  One such way was extended addressing,  as  that
     allowed  for  open-ended  addressing  in  ways  that could not be
     anticipated in advance,  so we could add anything we  might  need
     later  on without having to rewrite all of the existing software.
     Another was the SEAlink protocol,  so we could maintain backwards
     compatibility while allowing for much faster data transfer on par
     with  the  best  protocols  known.  [Forestalling an argument:  I
     didn't say "faster than",  I said "on par  with".  Remember  that
     the  main design criteria of SEAlink was high speed while keeping
     full compatibility with XMODEM and Modem7.  If you like,  we  can
     argue over the exact numbers another day.]

     Something  odd happened,  though.  The whole thing got tossed out
     the window.  Oh,  the FidoNet Protocol is still there,  but  it's
     now  just  one  possible protocol.  Systems linking up these days
     must negotiate over what protocol  they  will  use.  Why?  A  few
     percent difference in performance once in awhile?  Or just to  be
     new and different?

     No  matter.  What's done is done.  But I can't help but feel that
     something important was lost in the shuffle.

     Edward I. Koch
     Mayor City Of New York
     City Hall
     New York, New York



     Re: 179th Street And Hillside Avenue



     Dear Mayor Koch,

          Several months have gone by,  and  the  situation  at  179th
     Street  and  Hillside Avenue has not changed to any great extent!
     It certainly has not gotten any better!!!

          To refresh your memory,  I wrote to you detailing  the  fact
     that  I had been verbally abused several times when coming up out
     of the subway, by the "GYPSY" cab drivers.

          Since my last letter I have spent over 100  hours  observing
     the  situation to see what I could find out.  I am not nor have I
     ever been a gypsy cab driver (just in case you are interested). I
     am an angry City resident!

          The only  change  that  has  taken  place  is  an  increased
     presence  in the a.m.  hours (6:30 - 8:00) of inspectors from the
     T.L.C.,  who seem to be more interested in drinking  coffee  than
     correcting the situation they are paid to correct.

          But  that is not when they are needed!  They are needed from
     4:00 to 8:00 p.m.  on the corner of  179th  Street  and  Hillside
     Avenue,  which is where the "GYPSY" cabs block traffic, illegally
     park, and pick up their passengers.

          An increased police presence is needed on the  same  corner,
     but after the incident last night,  I fear even the police cannot
     or will not handle the situation.

          Last night a patrol car passed by  and  stopped  to  give  a
     gypsy  cab several (3) tickets.  As soon as the police left,  the
     driver got out of his cab,  went over the other drivers who  hang
     around on the sidewalk,  said,  "F**k those cops",  and ripped up
     the tickets and threw them on the sidewalk.

          About 15 minutes  later,  after  the  driver  returned  from
     taking 5 people in his car (at $1 per person),  he was loading up
     again when the same police car passed by.


          To the officers credit, they stopped and issued him at least
     FidoNews 4-45                Page 3                    7 Dec 1987


     seven tickets after inspecting his car.

          They did not however make him unload the passengers from his
     car,  and when they left after giving him the tickets,  he ripped
     them right up, and threw them in the road!

          What  type  of police force are you running?  If I ripped up
     tickets,  I would be held accountable.  Why are gypsy cab drivers
     immune from the law?

          Several  weeks  ago,  the gypsy cabs had the corner of 179th
     and Hillside so blocked,  that an ambulance had to  ride  on  the
     SIDEWALK  for  one  entire  block of Hillside Avenue to get close
     enough to a building to go inside to  help  the  person  who  was
     sick!

          The  parking  lot  of Burger King,  who hires youth from the
     area,  is another problem.  When the gypsy cabs hear  the  police
     coming  (they  always blow their sirens to allow them time to get
     away) most of them pull into the  Burger  King  lot  and  solicit
     passengers  from  the  lot,  where  they know the police will not
     touch  them.   Needless  to  say,  this  makes  the  parking  lot
     impossible to access for a paying customer.

          We are not talking about just a few gypsy cabs here.  We are
     talking about an organized business, led by "Dudley", of 35 to 45
     cabs  soliciting  people  on  a regular basis.  It takes about 10
     minutes from the time a gypsy cab leaves until he  returns.  Each
     cab  carries  a minimum of 5 people (they won't go unless the car
     is full) with some carrying 11 people in a van.  During the  busy
     time period (4 p.m. to 8 p.m.) this comes out to an average of 30
     passengers per cab/per hour.

          Throughout those 4 hours over 4800 people are transported by
     gypsy cabs,  5 days a week.  When the cabs are stopped because of
     police presence,  these people are forced to take  the  City  bus
     instead.  It  translates  out  to  a  loss  to  the  City of over
     $24,000.00 per 5 day business week,  or over $1,228,000 per  year
     in  lost  revenue  to  the  Transit Authority and the City of New
     York!

          Of course these figures do not reflect the  additional  loss
     incurred when these cabs operate in the a.m. hours as well as the
     p.m. hours.

          Additional  revenue  to  the  City  is lost in other ways as
     well.  Let us assume that 50% of these cab drivers pay City taxes
     on their cash income (and that is a very, very large assumption),
     then 50% of them do not pay taxes!


          These  figures  are for only one of hundreds of areas in the
     City (major subway stations) where this occurs on a daily  basis.
     If  this  situations  exists at even 10 of the major subway stops
     throughout New York City, the loss in revenue to the City becomes
     astronomical!

          "Dudley" (he calls himself "Dudley", which may or may not be
     his real name) who you might remember  I  mentioned  in  my  last
     letter  is  still  in  business.  Dudley apparently works for the
     Transit Authority,  (as he has been seen inside token booths) and
     purchases  the  tokens  from  the  other  gypsy  cab drivers at a
     discounted price.

          What he does with the tokens is a mystery, although informed
     sources say he allegedly sells them to people  who  come  to  the
     token  booth.  If  true,  then this is another instance where the
     City is loosing revenue.  The tokens are sometimes given  to  the
     gypsy  cab drivers to pay for the fare instead of cash,  which is
     why they need an inside man to redeem them for them.

          I asked around one day,  why no one seems to care when  they
     get  tickets.  The  answer was a good one,  and I thought I would
     pass it on to you, Mayor Koch.  I was told, "If we get a bunch of
     tickets  in  one day,  we go to motor vehicles the next day,  and
     claim a license plate was either lost or stolen".

          They receive the new plates long before the tickets are  due
     in  court,  and in most cases are never called to account for the
     tickets. Of course, they told me, "We can't do that to often, but
     once in a while we get away with it".

          People are yelled at  when  they  come  out  of  the  subway
     entrance,  and more than once,  fights have started over who gets
     what passenger. Crude and vulgar remarks are made to women by the
     gypsy cab drivers as the women come out of the subway.

          Not too long ago, the police gave out a bunch of tickets and
     left. They were back within minutes, and they were back in force!
     It seems someone ("DUDLEY") allegedly got on  his  CB  radio  and
     called in a 10-13 on channel 9, the CB emergency channel.

          Not bad enough he did that,  it was reported that "shots had
     been fired and an officer  was  down"!  Now  I  don't  blame  the
     police for responding the way they did.  However I feel sorry for
     anyone  who  got  in  their  way,  as  they were going to help an
     officer in trouble.

          Several false alarms have been sent in  from  that  area  as
     well.

          Cannot  say  for sure who did it,  but if you would come and
     watch what goes on here on 179th Street and Hillside,  you  would
     get an understanding of who did it.

          After  spending this additional time observing this area,  I
     submit   the   following   suggestions   for    your    immediate
     consideration.

          1) Station  2  police officers in a patrol car on the corner
             of 179th Street and Hillside Avenue.  Park  this  car  on
             179th  Street from 4 p.m.  to 8 p.m.  Monday thru Friday,
             for a period of 30 days,  with explicit  instructions  to
     FidoNews 4-45                Page 5                    7 Dec 1987


             ticket each and every gypsy cab.

          2) Station  1  police officer in the Burger King parking lot
             (with Burger King's cooperation)  to  prevent  the  gypsy
             cabs from picking up inside the parking lot.

          3) Station  2  TLC  Inspectors on the corner of 179th Street
             and Hillside Avenue,  from 4 p.m.  to 8 p.m.  Monday thru
             Friday,  for  a  period  of  30 days with instructions to
             ticket each  and  every  gypsy  cab  they  see  for  each
             infraction of the law they find.

          4) Station  1  TLC  Inspector in the Burger King parking lot
             (with Burger King's cooperation)  to  prevent  the  gypsy
             cabs from picking up inside the parking lot.

          5) Station  a  Traffic  Department tow truck on the scene to
             remove cars found to  be  operating  without  the  proper
             insurance, inspection and registration documents.

          6) Provide  legislation  that  would  make  the illegal sale
             and/or purchasing of tokens a crime.

          The first 4 items  might  seem  like  overkill  to  you  Mr.
     Mayor,  but  I  can assure you they are not!  A favorite trick of
     these gypsy cab driver is to get out of his car, as soon as he is
     parked. This allows for two things to occur.

          A) He can get closer to people coming out of the subway.

          B) When the police do come, there is no driver in the car.





          If you remember my last letter,  you might remember the fact
     that  I  told  you  I  would  give  you  a  chance  to remedy the
     situation,  and crush the rumors that,  "The Mayor is  afraid  of
     these people and won't do anything to resolve the problem"!

          Well  you  had  ample time and nothing has been done by your
     office about it.

          Now we will see what the people have to say!

          Copies of this letter are going  to  all  major  newspapers,
          radio  and  television  stations,  and  corporate taxi fleet
          owners.  The taxi owners can  use  it  in  their  next  rate
          decision hearings.

          New  York  City  was  once a fine place to live in.  It is a
     shame we have a Mayor who seems to be  afraid  of  a  little  bad
     publicity, to save the City millions of dollars annually.
