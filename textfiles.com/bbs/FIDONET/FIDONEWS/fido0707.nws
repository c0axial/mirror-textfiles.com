     A Coherent Look At Gateways
     By:  Jason Steck
          1:104/424@FidoNet

          Over the past two or three years, many networks have
     sprung up based, to varying extents, on the FidoNet technical
     standards for session protocol and, more problematically,
     addressing.  With the establishment of built-in support for
     zones in popular software, the so-called "OtherNets"
     experienced a population explosion both in number of nets and
     number of sysops belonging to them.

          The primary device used to create an OtherNet was, and is,
     the use of a unique zone number.  FidoNet was already using
     zones 1-3 (and is now up to 5 with rumors of a 6), therefore
     OtherNets began utilizing zone numbers ranging from 7
     (AlterNet) to the upper limit of the existing nodelist
     processors (99 -- EggNet).  This upper limit now stands at 255
     (internal QuickBBS limit) and is poised to move upward to
     Binkley's inherent limit of 4096.

          While there is obviously little danger of running out of
     zone numbers or even, with a modicum of coordination, the
     duplication of a zone among two networks, the "pseudo-zone"
     scheme of network creation fails badly when internetwork
     communication is desired.  The purpose of this article is to
     address the previously proposed schemes in comparison to the
     gateway concept as introduced by FidoNet Gateway Policy and as
     in operation at UFGates around the world.

          Under a pseudo-zone scheme, a sysop in one network is
     often unable to respond to messages originating in another
     network.  For example, let's say a sysop in the current zone
     1-5 FidoNet receives a message from a node in zone 98.  Chances
     are, the FidoNet sysop has no idea even what network zone 98
     is, let alone how to respond.  The sysop simply does not have,
     and could not get without significant and unnecessary
     investigation and effort, the zone 98 nodelist information.
     This problem is especially significant in the netmail response
     to echomail in which case both parties are likely to be unknown
     to each other and separated by large (and expensive) geographic
     distances.

          As the OtherNets have grown, a number of suggested
     solutions have been put forward.  To wit:

          1)  Set up zonegates between FidoNet and the OtherNets.

     FidoNews 7-07                Page 2                   12 Feb 1990


          Rationale:  With this system, no node number is truly
     unknwon so long at that network's number is unique and is
     listed in the FidoNet nodelist as a zonegate.  For example,
     zone 98 mail could be sent to 1:1/98 for forwarding into
     Mil-Net (that's who it is, by the way).  The zonegate, by being
     "known" to both networks, would function as the interface
     point.

          Disadvantages:  First, there is a serious problem with
     cost.  Why should a FidoNet sysop (me) in Denver wishing to
     contact an AlterNet node in Denver (say, Larry Kayser) be
     required to route through a zonegate in, say, New York (the
     likely site of such a zonegate)?  Such a system is too limited
     in scope and rigid for internetwork operation.  Zonegates are
     designed, and function quite well, as ocean-spanning cost
     savers.  However, they are NOT designed to handle internetwork
     connectivity in cases where the two networks exist in the same
     broad geographic area.
          Secondly, a zonegate arrangement FORCES OtherNets to be
     dependant and parasitical on FidoNet.  True independance is not
     possible when a network's communication depends entirely on the
     goodwill of ANOTHER network's nodelist prodcution and on the
     development of another network's technology base.  A zonegate
     system, by its design, is OWNED by the administrators of the
     network where it is listed.  A superior system would allow for
     internetwork implementations on a diversified, local sysop
     level rather than at the network administrative level.

          2) Destroy OtherNets or cut them off from FidoNet

          Rationale:  The rationale for this "solution" is based on
     two basic assumptions:  First, that FidoNet is the "one true
     network" and that OtherNets are inherently parasitical.
     Historically, at least, this assumption has some basis in fact.
     FidoNet did exist FIRST in the amateur networking field and the
     OtherNets were dependant on FidoNet for maintainence of the
     technology base and, later, for echomail.  The second
     assumption is that OtherNets are totally political "SchismNets"
     established solely as a reaction to personal or political
     problems in FidoNet.  If both assumptions are accepted, then
     the "solution" becomes natural.

          Disadvantages:  Obviously, both assumptions are not always
     true.  However, the larger problem with this "solution" is the
     judgementalism inherent in it.  The entire object of networking
     in the first place was to enhance communication.  The above
     "solution" to the internetwork problem is somewhat
     understandable at times, but is ultimately counter to the
     entire spirit of FidoNet and networking in general as it seeks
     to LIMIT communications on the basis of some vague and subjective
     political or social judgement which is passed.  With such a
     "Final Solution" to OtherNets, the debate leaves the technical
     realm of HOW to communicate and enters an unpleseant political
     realm where whole networks are condemned as criminals of a sort
     or are required to pass personal, social, or political muster
     with individual network administrators.
     FidoNews 7-07                Page 3                   12 Feb 1990


          Furthermore, in recent times, various OtherNets have begun
     to disprove the assumptions inherent in the above "solution".
     OtherNets have developed unique personalities and atmospheres
     in their own right, totally distinct from FidoNet.  They have
     extended old technology and occasionally developed new
     standards and many have specifically endeavored to maintain
     friendly, rather than schismatic relations with FidoNet and its
     administrators.

          3) Gateway Operations

          Advantages:  Although often confused with zonegates,
     gateways operate quite differently and, ultimately, more
     powerfully than zonegates while allowing for internal
     sociopolitical independance not allowed by the "nuke 'em
     solution".  Zonegates are limited by design to a single system
     at a single location.  Gateways, on the other hand, can exist
     in many locations simultaneously, each serving a smaller, more
     managable area and providing local-call gateway access in more
     cases.  This leads to a couple of major advantages over the
     zonegate solution:  First, gateways are more reliable.  If a
     zonegate system goes down, the link is cut.  If a gateway
     system goes down, links only need to be switched to another,
     already operating, gateway to the same network.  2)  Gateways
     are cheaper.  A zonegate would only be a local call to the
     immediate area of its physical location.  However, since
     gateway systems can be numerous and physically diversified,
     gateways would be local calls to every area they existed in.
     Where there is a need, there could be a gateway.  People who
     would be long (expensive) distance to a zonegate would be able
     to call the gateway just down the road.
          A further advantage is technical.  With a zonegate
     arrangement, the OtherNet is dependant on FidoNet technology.
     Under a gateway system, ONLY the gateway(s) need "speak the
     FidoNet language".  In this way, the OtherNets are freed to
     pursue extensions to FTSC technology or to even abandon it
     altogether in favor of a totally different system while, at the
     same time, utilizing gateways as "translators" to ensure
     continued connectivity with the venerable FidoNet.

          While it may not idealize each individual set of
     preferences, prejudices, and opinions, the gateway option has
     clear technical and sociopolitical advantages over the more
     expensive and draconian "solutions" previously proposed.
     Additionally, it is a supremely valid compromise to a seemingly
     endless quagmire of internetwork political warfare over the
     "ownership" of communications mediums and over the viability or
     status of various networks or their internal administrative
     techniques.  Instead of arguing over "who's show is better" in
     a futile attempt to hash out a uniform set of internal "rules"
     for all networks, the gateway solution allows each network to
     develop and maintain a unique identity without having to
     undergo judgement from another network and without having to
     reduce or eliminate connectivity options.  The simple maxim of
     the gateway is:  "When in Rome, speak Latin".  Quite simply,
     messages in FidoNet have FidoNet addressability and obey
     FidoNews 7-07                Page 4                   12 Feb 1990


     FidoNet technical standards.  Similarly, messages in another
     network follow THAT network's technical and addressing
     standards.

          A properly implemented gateway system will act as a
     bridge, not a barrier, between networks.  And, as such,
     organizations (such as the FreeNet Project -- you didn't think
     you'd get away without a plug, did you?) and individuals
     interested in expanding network communications should at least
     welcome the gateway concept and work towards its successful
     establishment in FidoNet and elsewhere.

          (For more information on the FreeNet Project, feel free to
     contact me by netmail at 1:104/424@FidoNet.  A future FidoNews
     article will introduce the FNP and cover some gateway
     procedures.)

            READIT! - The Nodelist Analyzer and Search Utility

     READIT! Version 1.00 is a totally rewritten, newly formatted
     version of the original Nodelist Search/Browse Utility.  It is a
     comprehensive, fast nodelist analyzer with multiple search and
     match options.  Sysop names are searched and matched via a
     separate compiled sysop name file.

     Version 1.00 has some exciting new features and dramatically
     increased search speed over all previous releases.

     READIT! is being released as three different programs for use
     with the more common nodelist structures.

       1) READIT_6! is designed to use pre-compiled "Version 6"
          Nodelists (Nodelist.Idx and Nodelist.dat) commonly used with
          BinkleyTerm and OPUS 1.10.

       2) READIT_5! supports "Version 5" nodelists used with OPUS
          1.03b (Nodelist.Idx and Nodelist.Sys).

       3) READ_DOG! searches and analyzes SEAdog(tm)-style nodelists.

     READIT! allows the Sysop to search nodelists with a variety of
     keys, such as Sysop name, BBS name, Cities/States, Regions,
     Hosts, individual nodes (and zone-sensitive information with
     READIT_6!). Categorization of the nodelist by Region, Net (and
     Zone, where applicable) is available through separate functions.

     A new option allows simple nodelist editing giving the sysop the
     ability to quickly update node information (node name, phone
     number, continuous mail flag, password, etc...) without having to
     recompile the nodelist.

     Results may be saved as commented disk files or sent to printer
     output.

     The three versions of READIT! may be found on the SDS nodes or
     directly from  1:19/210 or 7:764/2036 under the following names:

         READIT_6.ZIP  ==>  Version 6 nodelists (OPUS 1.10 and BT)
         READIT_5.ZIP  ==>  Version 5 nodelists (OPUS 1.03b and BT)
         READ_DOG.ZIP  ==>  SEAdog-style nodelists (SEAdog and TBBS)

     File requests and update are available from 1:19/210 or
     7:764/2036 under the following magic-filenames:

         READIT6       ==>  READIT_6.ZIP
     FidoNews 7-07                Page 6                   12 Feb 1990


         READIT5       ==>  READIT_5.ZIP
         READDOG       ==>  READ_DOG.ZIP

     READIT! is released as shareware.

     ANNOUNCING THE VOLUNTEER ECHO

     Intro
     -----
     VOLUNTEER is a new echo which for the dissemination of information
     related to volunteer work.  The scope of this echo will cover
     Federal, State, County, Local, Public and Private volunteer work
     (basically any volunteer work).  If you have time to volunteer,
     hopefully this echo will help you find an organization to assist.
     If you are a volunteer, you can share your knowledge with readers
     of this echo.  If you are not a volunteer, hopefully this echo will
     provide a level of awareness and insight regarding volunteer work.

     Backround
     ---------
     What made me form this echo?  Well, perhaps it can be called a case
     of self-realization.  In my family, my sister is a volunteer member
     of our town's First Aid Squad, and besides riding calls she teaches
     CPR and keeps the squad's books; my father volunteers his time as a
     hunter safety instructor and keeps our church's books; my mother
     works the information desk as a volunteer at the local hospital; my
     brother just joined the First Aid Squad and has been active in many
     of the service clubs in High School and church.

     What do I do as a volunteer?  Nothing.  Something I hope to correct
     shortly.  Many of us receive so much, but don't return much.  So as
     I educate myself on volunteer work and find some organization that
     can put up with me for my free time, I'd like to share the informa-
     tion I gather with the Fidonet network through the echomail media.

     Initial Availability
     --------------------
     VOLUNTEER will initially be available for linkage via. 1:269/111;
     this system, which I sysop, is mail-only, running Front Door (I am
     using the "old" version that supports SEAlink), with a 9600 HST
     modem, open 24 hours a day.  Hopefully volume will rise to a level
     that enables this echo to be carried on the Fidonet backbone.

     As a side note, although as of now I am not PC-Pursuitable, I am
     moving in March 1990 and the new phone number (as of NODELIST.068)
     will be accessible via. PC Pursuit (my node address will NOT change).

     Questions, comments, requests for linkages, co-moderators, volunteers,
     et. al. welcome of course.  I can be reached at 1:269/111, 6:6001/5,
     7:520/953 or 99:9220/202.

     A View from the Bridge
     Phil Buonomo, 1:107/583

     "Captain's Log, Stardate 9002.10"

     Howdy.  I was going to parody an Andy Rooney column this week,
     but considering the trouble he's been in recently, I guess I'll
     skip it.

     Do you ever wonder why some celebrities keep getting caught with
     their foot in their mouth?  I do.

     I mean, does it taste good to them, or something?  ;-)

     I'd like to talk a little about internetwork messaging.  It
     seems that there's been a lot of hullabaloo about all this since
     the first 'alternate' network popped up.  Sysops tend to be a
     very over protective breed about their network, their bbs
     software, their unpacker, their front end mailer...
     Unfortunately, this all means that we talk a lot less to each
     other.  ("You're not in my nodelist, therefore you don't exist.
     POOF!")  This is just plain silly.

     Now, it seems like 2 or 3 guys 'at the top' want to see this
     document put in place for FidoNet.  I asks meself, "Self... why
     is this necessary?"  You know what?  I couldn't find an answer.

     There aren't tons of dupes coming thru the echo feeds.  No one
     seems to be dumping tons of netmail on the gateways, so WHY all
     this nonsense about signing agreements, and stuff?  If the
     messages aren't compatible, the software won't pass them on, so
     what's the big deal?  I think it has to do with "CONTROL".

     Well, anyway, this document is supposed to be "put up to a
     vote".  A vote of who?  Are you and I going to vote on it?
     Don't bet on it.  IFNA was probably the last chance on getting
     any sort of legitimate democracy put in place in this network,
     and you can kiss that goodbye.  (Whatever happened to Jason
     Steck, anyway?  He had a proposal "all set" to go in place on
     12/3/89.  Maybe he sent it thru one of those gateways the
     document talks about, and it got deleted 'cause the gate didn't
     like his looks?)

     Well, I just don't think its necessary, so I'm sure *I* won't
     have a say in whether we put it in place or not.

     BTW, just for the record, NO, I don't hang up on someone because
     they're not in my network.  That's the same as hanging up on
     someone because they're black, jewish, gay, or poor, no matter
     what anybody else says.  Private clubs are a thing of the past.
