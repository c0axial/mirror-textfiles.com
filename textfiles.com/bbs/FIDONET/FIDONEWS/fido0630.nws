     =================================================================


     Here's something  you  might not have seen yet, if you don't read
     the comments published in the weekly nodediff:

     [start of quote]

     This is  perhaps one of the saddest notices I have written in the
     nodediff.  I  have  tended  my  resignation  as the International
     Coordinator of Fidonet to  the  FidoNet  Zone Council.  I will be
     staying on in the position  to  facilitate the smooth transistion
     to  the  next  IC, however I  will  not  be  hearing  any  policy
     complaints at this time.  In other  words, I will stay as long as
     it  takes  to  get a successor in place,  and  will  do  what  is
     necessary  to  keep the network technically operational, anything
     else will need to wait until the next IC is installed.

     For the  reasons  why,  this  will  be expounded in an article in
     FidoNews sometime in  the next month.  Ignore the rumors that I'm
     sure that will start up as soon as word starts spreading.  Nobody
     is  authorized  to claim that  a  certain  event,  individual  or
     anything else caused my resignation.   I  was not forced or asked
     by anyone to resign.  I did  this  because  I needed a break from
     the administrative workings of the network, and wanted  to  start
     devoting my time and energy into some of my favorite projects.

     [end of quote]

     That's right, folks.    David  Dodell  has  stepped down from his
     position as International Coordinator.

     Friends of David, don't weep for him.   He's  done his best.  Now
     it's time for someone else to do the job.    And  it's  time  for
     David  to devote some time to his personal interests, which  have
     been neglected far too long.  That includes his lovely wife, Amy.

     Enemies of  David,  don't  rejoice  over  some  apparent victory.
     You've won NOTHING.    Until  we  all recognize that we're in the
     middle  of  wars  that  will  result  in  total  unity  or  total
     destruction, and we're all pointed  towards unity, nothing can be
     gained through anyone's arrival or departure from the stage.

     I personally wanted David to resign  some  time  ago.  But it had
     nothing to do with power trips or  anything.    I thought that he
     had had enough.  That he should take  up  his  life  again.   Let
     someone else deal with this stuff.  At one  point,  he  was  very
     close to doing just that.  I still think it  unfortunate  that he
     decided to continue then. Just as I am happy for him now.

     This  job  I  have as FidoNews editor can often be very  painful.
     The worst part, however,  has  been  printing  articles  accusing
     David of being on some  kind  of  "power trip".  Nothing could be
     further from the truth.  David  is  just not that kind of person.
     What has been true, throughout, is that  David  has  a  vision of
     what he has wanted FidoNet to be.   It's a nice vision.  One that
     we could all share.  What also has been  true is that David has a
     vision of how that needs to be accomplished.  I  don't completely
     share that vision.  Many don't share it at all.   It  has  to  do
     with centralized authority and unquestioned leadership.  But what
     that meant was that as  long  as  David  held  power,  he  had to
     exercise it.  Hence the apparent  "power  trip".    Sorry if this
     disillusions some of you folks, but David  only  used  the  power
     because he thought he had to, not because he was drunk with it.

     I can't say that FidoNet will be a better place because of David.
     Right now it looks like the jury is out  on what it will be.  But
     whether you want to believe it or not, it would  almost certainly
     would  have been a worse place without David.  The next person to
     hold this job has my sympathy in advance.

     Best of luck, David. And THANKS!!

                                 Thoughts
                          By Butch Walker, 161/2

     As August  draws  near,  I  wanted to give you some thoughts, and
     some history.   What follows will not become an epic, nor will it
     be  repeated around campfires,  but  maybe  will  give  you  some
     perspective.

     My  first  experience with Computer  Tele-communications  was  in
     1978.  I had formed a  Pension  Administration  company  with  an
     Attorney and a CPA.  We needed  to  communicate with a mainframe,
     so we purchased a Dec LA36.  Basically a dumb terminal (keyboard,
     line printer, and 300 baud modem with an acoustic coupler).  That
     was okay for a while but it was slow and  expensive.   Everything
     was  entered  on  line,  real  time.  In 1979 I personally  spent
     $20,000  for  a  CPT  8000,  which consisted of a 48k 8080, 2  8"
     floppies,  keyboard, monitor, internal 300  baud  modem,  special
     Diablo letter quality printer, dual sheet  feeders, etc.  Man all
     that power in one location.  [grin]

     In 1980, I sold my agency, my  share in the PA firm, and my share
     in  a  partnership  and  took  a  position  that  brought  me  to
     California.  With me came my CPT.  Late  1980  or early 1981, CPT
     released  a  CP/M  disk  for  the  machine and it became  a  data
     processor.  I and a couple of others started writing programs  in
     CBasic  for our company.  The CPT was in Oakland and I  lived  in
     Clayton, so I decided to get a micro for the house.  After months
     of shopping  I purchased mail order an S100 machine with 64k, two
     1.2mb 8" floppies,  CRT,  and a 300 baud modem card.  All for the
     amazingly low price of $3,800.

     At night I'd put  BYE.COM up on the CPT and if I needed something
     I'd pull it off.   I  also  called a few CP/M boards both locally
     and back in Michigan.  Boy, what a deal!

     By 1984 it was obvious that IBM and the clones were here to stay.
     Also,  the  S100  machine was on it's  last  legs.    Parts  were
     impossible to find, nothing was standardized, and I  was tired of
     trying to do the repair work myself, so I  bought  a Leading Edge
     Model M, plus an expansion chassis, a 10mb hrad drive  and  a 5mb
     Syquest removable cartridge drive.  Boy I was in heaven, 640k  of
     ram,  two  360k  floppies,  and 15mb of hard disk storage all for
     only  $6,500.  I also bought a Hayes 1200 internal modem.  It was
     now the big time folks.  [grin]

     In the  fall  of  1985  I needed to set up a bulletin board for a
     users group.   I  looked  at  RBBS, PC-Board, and several others.
     Mike Kelleher was running  Fido.   After talking to Mike, reading
     the docs, it seemed that Fido provided the answer to the problem.
     In October of 1985 I brought up a one line Fido at 1200 baud.  At
     that time only Nets 125 & 143 existed in the Bay Area.  I applied
     for a node number, but was told I'd  have  to apply as a regional
     FidoNews 6-30                Page 4                   24 Jul 1989


     independant  as  I was too far away from from  either  net.    So
     10/625 TBLUG came up in November of 1985.

     By January of '86 I went to two lines.   My company bought an IBM
     AT, which I took up to 8mhz, I added a JRam  AT  card and brought
     up Multilink, put on two Courier 2400's and away we went.   Well,
     some of  the  time anyway.  Multilink loved to hang.  Sometimes I
     thought the system was down more than it was up.  My wife used to
     hate it when I  tried  to  loggon  from home only to discover the
     system was hung.  Away  I'd  go  to the office, regardless of the
     time of day or night.

     In February, Mike Kelleher told me  to log on to Harv's board and
     check  out  something  called echomail.  At  that  time  echomail
     involved a few boards in Dallas and Harv  in San Francisco.  Mike
     and I both jumped on the bandwagon.  Ah  the  early  days.  Mucho
     bugs  in  scanmail  and tossmail.  Thousands of dupes, processing
     mail by  hand  using  Fido's  external  mail  event.    Arcing it
     ourselves, manually uploading  it,  unarcing  it  and  processing
     manually.

     Detroit (my brother Don) coming on line, then Tampa (Wes Cowley),
     Atlanta (Ken Shackleford), New York/New  Jersey  (Gee  Wong), New
     Hampshire  (Bob  Hartman), Cleveland (Phil Ardussi).    Aha,  the
     first echomail backbone.

     In the spring of '86 it was  apparent that there were quite a few
     regional independants in the East Bay, and the  valley that might
     want to form a net.  I decided to see what could be done, and Net
     161 came into being.  Due to geography it made  a  great  deal of
     sense  to set up hubs from the beginning, so Mike Kelleher  wrote
     another WalkBro  &  Kelleher  almost useful utility to create hub
     routing files.   Mike  and  I set up the routing and a few of the
     pioneers met in Fairfield to organize the net.

     In September of '86 the echomail backbone was formalized.  We had
     a meeting in Chicago specifically  for  that purpose.  My brother
     Don and Mike Bader came over  from  Detroit,  Phil  Ardussi  from
     Cleveland, Jon Sabol from Dallas, Bob Hartman from New Hampshire,
     Gee  Wong  and  Thom  Henderson from New Jersey.    Topology  was
     mapped,  the  idea  of  an  echomail  policy  was  discussed,  84
     commercials for SeaDog were listened too [grin], Arcmail was fine
     tuned, and Opus was discussed (we were already beta testing it at
     the time).  Heck I even paid Hartman for Renum.

     It was about the same time that we took the Net161 echo  regional
     for all NorCal nets.  Probably the first ever.  It was a  fun and
     exciting time.   The net was growing by leaps and bounds, Fidonet
     was growing, echomail was  booming, other than mikey, IFNA, and a
     few other things fun times were had by all.  The Dobyns Award was
     created and handed out with vigor.

     FidoNews 6-30                Page 5                   24 Jul 1989


     In the summer of '87 my  office  burnt  to the ground, taking the
     echomail distribution machine with it.  Four hours later, my home
     system was moving the echomail once again.   Only  a  handful  of
     messages were never disributed.  A few months later,  due  to  an
     error  in judgement, I got appointed Zone 1 Echomail Coordinator.
     Boy,  I really had no idea what I was getting into,  but  someone
     needed to do it.

     In the early summer of '88 I decided it was time to  let  someone
     else  have the fun of being net host, and conned Diane Smith into
     taking over.  Again Net 161 made Fidonet history as Diane was the
     first female host ever.  August of '88 brought Fidocon, and I had
     been conned by my  other brother Mark into speaking.  For a while
     it looked as if I  wasn't going to make it.  But finally I took a
     redeye into Cinci and arrived there early in the morning.  Heck I
     can't even remember if it was Thursday  or Friday.  That night we
     went until 5:00am working on compromises on an  echomail  policy,
     maybe I only made it until 3am, shoot I  don't  remember.   All I
     know is that I was one tired camper.  I  gave  two  talks, one on
     Multitasking and BBS's, and one on Echomail.

     Last winter enough was enough, and I resigned as ZEC.   I decided
     it  was  time for someone else to wear the target on their  back,
     and  I would retire to being a normal (if there is such a  thing)
     sysop.  Late December through  late  January brought more changes
     in my personal life, and now  I prepare to move to Cleveland Ohio
     and return to school after a 20 year absence.  While I still plan
     on being in Fidonet (I'm already in the  nodelist in Net 157), my
     role will be a very minor one.

     I'd like to think I accomplished some good.  Net 161 has spun off
     three nets (203, 205 & 208) and helped start a  fourth  (204).  I
     think Net 161 has helped set an example of how a net can function
     without problems, personality conflicts,  or  turmoil.  We helped
     bring echomail & Opus to  Fidonet.  We've beta tested Opus, Lynx,
     SeaDog, Binkley, Confmail, the original echomail  utilities,  and
     multitudes of Fidonet related utilities.  We've written utilities
     for Fidonet.  We started a Net Newsletter  that  almost  had more
     readership internationally than Fidonews at one time.  161/2  has
     feed  Region  10,  17,  19,  14,  Malaysia,  England,  and others
     echomail  over the years.  In fact 161/2 has probably pumped  out
     millions of echomail messages since February of '86.  Heck I have
     the failed hard drives to prove it.  [grin]

     I've had fun, I've experienced frustration, I've been praised and
     been called many  unprintable names.  I've made some good friends
     around the world, and probably some enemies as well.  I just hope
     that  over time I'll be  remembered  as  someone  who  cared  and
     contributed what he could.

     Thanks for the memories.

     A Response to Doug Thompson
     by Phil Buonomo (1:107/583, 7:520/583, 9:807/1)

     I would like to thank Doug Thompson for his insightful article of
     last week's FidoNews.  It is obvious that Doug was taken by David
     Dodell and believed everything  DD  said.    This is not meant to
     imply anything about the veracity  of DD, or Doug's perception of
     what was said.  What I  intend  to do is to merely point out that
     the claims of Mr.  Dodell do  not  seem to fit the facts.  In his
     article, Doug said:

          1) David assured me that no one would  be  removed  from the
          nodelist  for  any  opinion  or  statement  about  policy 4,
          including an expressed refusal to comply with it.  The  only
          grounds for excommunication remain  technical and *repeated*
          violations of policy must occur  before  an  excommunication
          would occur.  That is to  say  a  violation  will  get you a
          warning,  repeat  violations  can  get  you  excommunicated.
          Refusing  the  acknowledge the legitimacy of policy 4  can't
          get you either.

          In fidonet it continues to be "legal" to speak your mind and
          say  darned  near  anything  you want without fear of direct
          punishment.   Our coordinators will not be taking a cue from
          the  Ayatollah    and  issuing  death-warrants  for  calling
          Mohammed a devil,  cursing  Tom  Jennings'  mother  or even,
          presumably, cursing their coordinator.

     Unfortunately, Doug apparently either  did not see, or forgot the
     following  message  that was printed,  right  here  in  FidoNews,
     between Jim Grubs and Steve Bonine,  Jim's  RC,  and  the  recent
     secretly elected new Zone 1 ZC:

      >JG> The question which remains unanswered is the legitimacy of
      >JG> Policy 4.  You can neither excommunicate nor canonize
      >JG> under a policy document that was not legally adopted.
      >JG> The rules under which it was adopted were made up
      >JG> unilaterally as the process went along. Furthermore, I was
      >JG> not a part of the process. The *C's can enter into all
      >JG> the agreements among themselves they want to. They can't
      >JG> force people who were not a party to that agreement to
      >JG> comply with it. I could organize a bunch of sysops and
      >JG> 'pass' Policy 7-requiring the *C's to wear mirrored
      >JG> eyeshades and carry nerf bats, too. So, what?  Do as you
      >JG> wish. You will anyway.
      >JG> 73 de Jim Grubs, W8GRT

      SB> I am accepting the above message as an affirmation of your
      SB> desire to terminate your relationship with FidoNet since

      SB> your past contributions to FidoNet, many of which have been
      SB> positive. Should you have a change of heart and decide that
      SB> you are willing to be bound by FidoNet policy, please
      SB> re-apply for a node number.

     Those are Steve Bonine's exact words, friends.    This is the man
     whom David Dodell wishes to be the new  ZC1  of FidoNet, YOUR ZC!
     Of  course, when Jim Grubs appealed this action to  David  Dodell
     himself,  his  appeal  was  rejected and he was removed from  the
     nodelist, supposedly  for  ONE  bombing  run!  That doesn't sound
     like REPEATED technical violations to me.  How about YOU?

     Next, Doug raises the following point:

          2) David expressed  surprise  at  the result of the p4 vote.
          He  had  expected  it    to    be   defeated.    So  had  I.
          Understandably  this intensifies my concern  that  the  room
          allowed for electoral abuses actually might  well  have been
          used more than once or twice.

     It  is  interesting  that  he  should say  this.    David  Dodell
     'repealed' the ECHOPOL1 doc that was put in  place  via  a voting
     mechanism  similar  to that which passed POLICY4, due to  claimed
     'irregularities'  in  the  voting.    If  that  is  so, and  he's
     'surprised'  at  the  vote  for  Policy  4,  and  considering the
     'irregularities' that have come to light in the meantime, why has
     Mr.  Dodell not 'repealed' Policy 4?

     Another point:

          Excommunicating a node  if  it  is at all possible not to is
          directly equivalent to a  bank  burning hundred dollar bills
          because they cause some annoyance.    It is an attack on the
          very fundamental basics of the whole operation.

     Then why has Steve Bonine so  cavalierly  thrown sysops and whole
     NETS out of the nodelist, only to  have said actions confirmed by
     David  Dodell?   Hell, he's been REWARDED for  those  actions  by
     being made the next ZC!

          5) So we agree we have lots of problems  with  policy 4, and
          we agree that the best bet is to forge ahead with a policy 5
          process that will aim at learning from our mistakes.

     I would suggest that the IFNA BoD be allowed to vote on accepting
     Policy  4  (as  the  precedent  was set with adoption of the last
     policy)  before we 'forge ahead' with a Policy 5.  In 3 weeks  we
     may be back operating under Policy 3!  ;-)

          Policy 4 bans  the  use  of encryption which I find slightly
          bewildering since it is  being  so  rapidly  embraced by the
     FidoNews 6-30                Page 9                   24 Jul 1989


          rest of the world, and enhances the value of e-mail so much.
          That is the sort of decision which is wholly political since
          the "technology" would be mostly unaffected.

     Since  Policy  4 does this, it is  in  direct  violation  of  the
     Electronic Communications and Privacy Act of 1986, which makes it
     illegal to tamper with electronic communications.  No matter  how
     many  times  Mr.    Dodell  claims  that FidoNet is an  'amateur'
     operation in his Policy document, it STILL falls under this law.

     It  is  for  that  reason,  and those like it that I  wrote  this
     article.  Plainly, SOMEONE's getting a snow job here, be it Doug,
     myself, or ALL of us!

     Phil

     P.S.  Some quick answers to jim nutt's questions:

          Have any  of these people who are complaining actually taken
          a look at the work it takes to be an *C?

     Lots of work, but then again, so does being a fireman.  Does that
     give him the right to say whether you can have a telephone number
     listed in the phone book?

          What power does  a  *C  REALLY  have?    I mean, there isn't
          really anything there to  get  on a power trip over, now, is
          there?

     Depends.  He has the  power  to say whether your friends can send
     you mail or not.  If  there's  no 'power' to protect, why did the
     RC's write a policy document electing the *C structure for life?

          Do the vast majority of sysops even  care  about  the  petty
          bickering that is going on over Policy4?

     Funny.  I don't see any petty bickering.  But if you're asking if
     they're  concerned  over  the discussion going on, I don't  know.
     But they SHOULD be.  It affects them directly.

          Are  alternative  networks  the  solution?    (I  say no, if
          anything, they are in worse shape than Fidonet)

     From my  own  experience,  I can name two that are in much BETTER
     shape than FidoNet.    I  don't  think  they're  the  solution to
     FidoNet's problems though.  If I did, I'd quit FidoNet.

          Is the main reason  for  all  the  complaining  about policy
          simply a case of too  much  free  time  and  too little real
          work?

     FidoNews 6-30                Page 10                  24 Jul 1989


     Not in my case.  I  have a two month old son I've been sitting up
     with every night.  I've 2 other  small  children  that have to be
     cared for.  I've been trying to hold  down the fort in a 3 person
     programming  department  with one employee (me) for a major  food
     distribution  firm.    I've  been  trying  to  set up a  national
     GroupMail Distribution  system  for  EVERYONE  to enjoy, and I've
     been writing like  crazy for FidoNews about the injustices of the
     system.  Why?  Because I CARE.

          Why in the world would anybody WANT to be a *C?!?!?

     Some people do it  for all the right reasons.  Many (several RC's
     and a ZC/IC come to  mind)  do  it for the feeling of 'authority'
     they get out of the job.    Why  else  are  people liquidated for
     refusing to 'cowtow' to the powers that  be?    Why  are networks
     eliminated for 'the good of FidoNet'?  What  good did it do me to
     have Net 154 removed?  Now I can't talk  to  'em!   (I guess some
     people just think that its for my own good...  ;-)

     Steve Boyd
     104/421

                      Democracy...is it for YOU?

     I may  or  may  not  represent  the average sysop.  I received my
     first computer in  1983,  a  Texas  Instruments  TI99/4A.   I was
     immediately taken by what  this  simple  machine could do for me.
     Soon I realized that the  TI99/4A  was  destined  for demise, and
     purchased a Commodore 64 (with my pay as an E-2 in the Air Force,
     and a wife and two kids, it  was  almost  more  than I could bear
     financially), which was surprisingly similar in operation.  Soon,
     I took the plunge, and bought my first modem, a 300 bauder that I
     had to manually dial out with my phone, and flip a switch to pass
     control of the call to the modem.  What I found  on the telephone
     lines  astounded  me!    to  be  able to connect my computer with
     another and exchange information, be it programs or messages, was
     the end to  my  means.   I could consult my gurus (sysops) with a
     simple phone call, and  ask for, and receive, any information and
     assistance I was in need of.  Soon the addiction took over, and I
     was hooked into my computer for good.

     I moved to Denver in 1987,  and  had already decided that I would
     be setting up a BBS.  Once  I  had  acquired the proper equipment
     for my C-64 (no small task...try setting up  a  Commodore with 11
     megs on-line!), I started my first, and VERY successful,  attempt
     at a BBS, The Dark Crystal.  The users were  enthusiastic, as was
     I,  and we quickly grew to 250+ users.  I decided  then  that  in
     order  to  speed up my message base, I would have to upgrade  the
     computer to  an  IBM  compatible,  and chose QuickBBS for my BBS.
     The Dark Crystal  has  taken  many  turns,  and  has  changed and
     adapted  to those changes,  but  nothing  so  rudely  changed  my
     attitude towards being a SysOp as did my induction to FiDoNet.

     I make no bones about  it...I  joined  FidoNet to get the CBM and
     Amiga  echos...I,  to  this  day, have  both  users  online  here
     regularly, as well as the Tandy CoCo  crowd.    Policy  3  was in
     effect, and until I specifically asked for a copy of this policy,
     I had little idea of what it said, let  alone how it was adopted.
     Sheer  ignorance,  and  perhaps  the burning desire to furnish my
     users with the best BBS I could offer, allowed me to join FidoNet
     under the  existing  circumstances.  I knew nothing about the net
     as a whole,  and  found, much to my elation, that the sysops here
     were the same as  the sysops i had grown to appreciate...helpful,
     courteous, and friendly.  With  the  help  of a few Denverites, I
     was  up and running and learning  about  the  technical  side  of
     operating as a node in FidoNet.   Soon, I was acting as a hub for
     echomail, and generally accepted in the local net as, at least, a
     person that could be counted on.

     But  a funny thing happened on the way to  that  point...I  found
     that certain sysops (and that is all we are, no?)  took  pleasure
     in  IMPOSING their will upon the whole of FidoNet.  At  first,  I
     realized  that  with  a  structure  as big as this, controls were
     neccesary, and  certain  things could not be tolerated.  Exposing
     SysOps to unnecceasry costs, causing technical snafus, etc., were
     FidoNews 6-30                Page 12                  24 Jul 1989


     all reasonable requests...but I  sensed  that  perhaps  those  in
     power (imposing term, no?) were  quietly slipping beyond the line
     of helping us to stay in  step,  and  were  starting  to mold the
     individuals into what *THEY* thought we should  be.  I started to
     go through policy a bit more thouroughly, as  before it was but a
     mere  inconvienience to follow, and found that I, the  individual
     node    in   FidoNet,  could  do  little  to  prevent  this  from
     proprogating into  a  full-fledged  dictatorship, in which the *C
     structure mandated everything, and I would be compelled to comply
     if I desired a  node number in this "hobbyist" network.  Policy 4
     was brought into being, and  that which I had feared the most was
     brought into being, though in a way that even I had not imagined.
     The NCs were cut out of the  process  altogether!   The RC and ZC
     structure took it upon themselves to install themselves as judge,
     jury, and executioner as far as policy was concerned.    The  RCs
     are appointed by the ZCs, who in turn are appointed  by  the RCs.
     Once you are able to clarify this, and the dizzying effect it has
     could cause you to stop and ponder for a while, you realize  that
     the upper-echelon  of  FidoNet  is  untouchable by you and I, the
     individual sysop that FidoNet is based on.

     Is this a  problem?    Are  you  directly  affected by this?  Has
     FidoNet  grown  beyond  the  point  that  it  is  ineffective  in
     administering  to  the  needs  of  the  individual  sysop?    All
     questions are personal in nature, and  until  YOU  decide to look
     into the way things are currently being  handled will YOU come to
     a decision.  I have made that assesment,  and  have  come  to the
     following conclusions:

     1. I,  as  a  lowly sysop in this network, have  no  say  in  the
        administration of it.

     2. I, as a lowly sysop in this network, MUST conform  or risk the
        ultimate penalty...excommunication!

     3. I,  as  a  lowly sysop in this network, do not matter  in  the
        large  scheme  of  things,  but  rather, am a pawn to be toyed
        with.

     4. I, am a lowly sysop in this network, am VERY dissatisfied with
        the power brokers, AS A WHOLE, of FidoNet.

     It matters  not  who  is  in charge...it matters not how fair and
     impartial they are...it  matters  not what their intentions.  The
     fact of the matter  is the RC/ZC totally control FidoNet, and are
     under no obligation to consult anyone out of their circle to make
     changes.  This is conceptually unacceptable,  and steps are being
     taken to erradicate the situation.

     Policy  5.XX is being developed by sysops  at  large,  and  being
     coordinated  by  Jason Steck at 104/424.  A  large  part  of  the
     developement  process is taking place in both the DEMOCRACY  echo
     and  the  SYSOP  echo,  and POL5_DEM is *CLOSE* to being  on  the
     backbone.    This  is a policy that falls back a few  steps,  and
     places he  importance  of  the  individual  node  back  into  the
     limelight, where it  always should have been.  Though Policy 4 is
     FidoNews 6-30                Page 13                  24 Jul 1989


     in effect, and we,  by  default,  are  bound  by it, we are by no
     means left without recourse.   The  *C structure is not the demon
     some will believe;  in fact,  the  *C  structure has offered more
     encouragement and support than the general populace.  I urge YOU,
     the lowly sysop in the huge net, to at least familiarize yourself
     with  this  proposed  policy,  and take whatever action YOU  deem
     neccesary.  After all, to demand that you see my  point  in  this
     would be hypocritical, no?  All I ask is that YOU  look  into the
     matter, whether it is FIDONEWS, the DEMOCRACY, SYSOP, or POL5_DEM
     echoes, or simply  ask  your  NC  what  he/she  feels  about  the
     situation.  Form your  own  opinion,  see  what Policy 4 actually
     says, see what we are  trying  to  implement,  and,  if  you feel
     motovated by your findings, act accordingly.   Too many of us are
     sitting on our hands, willing to accept what is thrown at us.  At
     least form an opinion of what is going  on,  as  WE  may be wrong
     about  the feelings of the net as a whole...the  silent  majority
     (VERY silent, and VERY large) is being claimed by both  sides  in
     this arguement.

                   Ravings, Cravings, and Mush Thoughts.

     I feel  like  I'm getting sucked into the swirl of the discussion
     for which probably  much to much has already been said.  But like
     most humans I have  an  opion  and  the genetic flaws in my brain
     make me feel like I  owe  it  to  the world to espouse them.  The
     editors comments, to this reader, in  Fidonews 628 show a lack of
     understanding  of the perspective for the guys  who  are  on  the
     "outside"  of any dictatorship looking in.  It  does  not  matter
     whether the dictators are good guys or bad guys...they  have  set
     themselves up as targets.  The fundamental problem is one  of the
     "outsiders" versus  the  "insiders".....or  I'm  in the "club" or
     not.  Thats  just  basic human psychology.  Let me relate a story
     from my past that  may  be  similar to whats happening in the net
     right now.

     I was put in charge  as  the  systems  programmer of our labs VAX
     11/780.  And did my best  to  do  all  the right things to insure
     security and uptime to the max extent  possible.   In my quest to
     make sure I didn't allow anything to go  haywire  I did not allow
     anyone to have system privileges except by direct appeal  to  me.
     In other words I had the keys to the kingdom  and  I was the gate
     master.  Well this to me seemed to be a good  arrangement since I
     would  know when anyone was doing anything "funny" on the system.
     Well this  one  guy  was  given  DIRIO...which  means he could do
     unrestricted calls to the device drivers of the operating system.
     His reason for having  it...over  my  objections...had  been  for
     speeding up his I/O for  a government contact the lab was working
     on.

     Well about 9 o'clock on a  Friday I get this call that the system
     is down and would I come in  to  see what the problem was.  I did
     and found 3 packs wiped and the system pack trashed.  Needless to
     say  I found the problem after taking all weekend  to  reset  the
     system  up  and promptly locked Mr.  DIRIOs account out  until  I
     could get a chance to talk(and beat up) to him.  On Monday....all
     hell  broke  lose...I  was  called in before the lab director and
     told that  I  was being a tyrant and that I was to let his people
     have whatever they  needed  to  do  their  work  or  I  would  be
     relieved!  So I  wrote  a  memo that afternoon that stated as the
     syspgmer I would no longer  restrict  privileges  and  would only
     require  a  letter  stating what and  why  the  access  would  be
     required and it would be granted.   This  lasted  about  2  weeks
     before users got tired of the unacceptable system performance and
     numerous  crashes  or hangs.  I was called in  again....but  this
     time I had the upperhand and made the lab director  setup a board
     of  user  representatives  to consider how and who would be given
     access  and  at  what  level.   AMAZING all of a sudden I  became
     everyones friend and no longer the tyrant systems programmer that
     everyone had to beg  to  get access.  Also the system ran just as
     well  and I didn't have  the  hassle  of  playing  "he's  a  good
     guy/he's not a good guy".

     Please take note of this experience.  I learned the hard way what
     being the gatemaster can be like.   Also if we setup a democratic
     system then when they start to complain then there will be a body
     that they can address their complaints to.  This will relieve the
     *Cs from playing judge and jury and let them do what they do best
     and  not  having  people  throw  mud in their faces.  I  for  one
     wouldn't  want  to  be  in  their position as long as the current
     situation remains...I out grew that with that VAX back in 1982.

     An OPEN letter from Dan Steurer, sysop, 1:170/405:

     To all RC, NC, Hubs, Nodes and Points of FidoNet, Zone 1:

     Last month,  our node, VSSI Tech Support BBS, 1:170/405, issued a
     mass mailing.   It  was  our intent to make a direct call to each
     node.  We, due  to  a  misunderstanding  of what the "Crash Mail"
     flag  meant  to our mailer,  did  this  "Bombing  Run"  via  host
     routing.    This aspect of the  operation  was  an  error  and  a
     violation of Policy 4.  I can  assure  that  a similar event will
     not occur again.

     Several NCs responded to this mailing, informing us of our error.
     We responded via net mail to all that we  knew  of.  At this time
     we  would  like  to  repeat  our  offer of payment for  any  long
     distance bills caused by our actions.  This offer is open  to  NC
     and  Hubs  alike.  Please send via US Mail a copy of  your  phone
     bill (with charges highlighted) to:

     assurance that it will not happen again.

     can pick the best stock for the week.  That is if there is enough
     interest, and this all gets going.

     I would also like to talk about how our economy effects the stock
     market, and how the various markets aroud the  world  affect  the
     global economy.

     So if all this sounds interesting to you  drop me a line at
     1:120/110.

     I  have been a Fidonet SysOp now  for  about  2  years  and  have
     enjoyed every bit of it.  I joined  IFNA  last  May for the first
     time  when  a  friend  of  mine  sent  me  the   application  for
     membership.

     I have been in a national level position in a  International Star
     Trek Fan club now for about 3 years and now the  number  5 person
     who runs the 4100 plus International Club.  I have really enjoyed
     working at  a  International Level and would like the opportunity
     to  be  able  to  help  out  in  Fidonet/IFNA  in  anyway  I  can
     possibility can.

     I would if elected  listen  to  the  members  of Fidonet/IFNA and
     recommend things that are important  to  them to the board, would
     help in any way I can  possibility  help  in  (Committees,  I  am
     currently on the IFNA Ethics Committee) Fidocon or whatever.

     As I did state, I am a  new  comer  to  this,  but at times a new
     comer might be able to bring in fresh new ideas and/or revise old
     ideas to help mak the system work even better than before.

     If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask  me  via netmail or
     any other communications link.  I will get back to  you within 24
     hours of when I get your message.

     JOHN ROBERTS

     I'd say that my most important qualifications for the position of
     Director would  be  belief in the potential of FidoNet compatible
     mail systems and a sincere desire to help realize that potential.

     I believe that  IFNA has an important role to play in this future
     due to its unique  position  to  act  for  the furtherance of the
     technology without being hindered by  the  task of the day to day
     management of network operations and politics.    One role that I
     see for IFNA is as a public  representative of FidoNet technology
     and its potential to the media and regulatory  agencies.  Another
     is  the  creation of agreements for communication between various
     networks  using  FidoNet  and other technologies.  I also believe
     that it's  important  for  IFNA  to  enhance  its image among its
     constituency by being  responsive  to the will of its members and
     insofar as possible to  that  of  the  operators  of  all FidoNet
     compatible mail systems.

     If you share any of  these  beliefs, I'd appreciate you giving me
     the opportunity to help by your  support  with  your  vote in the
     coming election.

     KRIS A. VEITCH

     I am presently a member of the  BoD having replaced a Director as
     his Alternate.  I serve in many capacities within IFNA.  I am the
     Treasurer/Secretary,  Membership  Database  and    Correspondence
     Manager.   Many of you  know  me  through  NetMail  conversations
     concerning  your  membership  and others through  SnailMail  with
     renewal letters , Certificates of Membership and  the IFNANet.PVT
     list.  I thoroughly enjoy the work I perform.

     However, I am not just a good "paperwork" person.  I believe that
     IFNA  has  a  goal,  a  goal to bring the  knowledge  of  FIdoNet
     Technology to the common masses.  Yes, this may sound idealistic,
     it may  sound  completely  irrelevant  (or  irreverent)  to  most
     Sysops, but the  day  is  at  hand that our "world for Sysops" is
     waning.    Telecommunications  and    FidoNet   are  become  more
     accessible by the "non-techie" persons.    I  see IFNA separating
     itself completely from the Net Political  Scene  and  becoming  a
     Public  Relations/United  Nets  Organization  geared to promoting
     (Fido)Net Technology  (ie:FidoNet,  AlterNet,  EggNet,  FleetNet,
     RRNet, This Net  and  that)  to the public.  Additionally, I feel
     that IFNA would best  serve all Nets by being the liaison between
     Nets.  Assist each entity in obtaining Gateway Agreements and the
     like.  Help all Network entities  in  finding  a  point of common
     agreement  to  continue  the  spread  of  knowledge  through  our
     technology.  Again, these are my ideas for  IFNA,  to  assist and
     help, not control or politicize our world.  All  of  this  can be
