   Little is happening here.  A calm week and few articles in the
inbound, so this is a short issue.

   I have been thinking that it has been a long time since there
has been a Fidocon.  We have printed several notices of events
in Europe over the last year or two, but none in North America.
Summer is coming ... has no one planned a party?

   Here is the news.
========================================================================
                               Articles
========================================================================
"Dear Emily Postnews"

[Written specifically for USENET, but applies to echomail too. Author
unknown. Please step forward!]

        Emily Postnews, foremost authority on proper net behaviour,
        gives her advice on how to act on the net:
        -       -       -       -       -       -       -
Q: Somebody just posted that Roman Polanski directed Star Wars.  What
should I do?

A: Post the correct answer at once!  We can't have people go on
believing that!  Very good of you to spot this.  You'll probably be
the only one to make the correction, so post as soon as you can.  No
time to lose, so certainly don't wait a day, or check to see if
somebody else has made the correction.

And it's not good enough to send the message by mail.  Since you're
the only one who really knows that it was Francis Coppola, you have to
inform the whole net right away!

                                ------
Q: I read an article that said, "reply by mail, I'll summarize."  What
should I do?

A: Post your response to the whole net.  That request applies only to
dumb people who don't have something interesting to say.  Your
postings are much more worthwhile than other people's, so it would be
a waste to reply by mail.

                                ------
Q: I collected replies to an article I wrote, and now it's time to
summarize.  What should I do?

A: Simply concatenate all the articles together into a big file and
post that.  On USENET, this is known as a summary.  It lets people
read all the replies without annoying newsreaders getting in the way.
Do the same when summarizing a vote.

                                ------
Q: I saw a long article that I wish to rebut carefully, what should I
do?
FidoNews 11-15                 Page:  3                    11 Apr 1994


A: Include the entire text with your article, particularly the
signature, and include your comments closely packed between the lines.
Be sure to post, and not mail, even though your article looks like a
reply to the original.  Everybody *loves* to read those long
point-by-point debates, especially when they evolve into name-calling
and lots of "Is too!" -- "Is not!" -- "Is too, twizot!" exchanges.

Be sure to follow-up everything, and never let another person get in
the last word on a net debate.  Why, if people let other people have
the last word, then discussions would actually stop!  Remember, other
net readers aren't nearly as clever as you, and if somebody posts
something wrong, the readers can't possibly realize that on their own
without your elucidations.  If somebody gets insulting in their net
postings, the best response is to get right down to their level and
fire a return salvo.  When I read one net person make an insulting
attack on another, I always immediately take it as gospel unless a
rebuttal is posted.  It never makes me think less of the insulter, so
it's your duty to respond.
                              ------

Zone Gate? Ja!

   Hey! This is just for the Guiness Records!

   In people words: Somebody sent me a message one year and a half ago,
in November 4th, 1992. That message went out of Randy Bush system last
March 26th.

   This is only an example of many others messages I've receive last
week, including one from Bob Moravsik (1:2606/583) saying this:

>>  Dearest RC's:
FidoNews 11-15                 Page:  4                    11 Apr 1994

>>
>>  I was asked by the policy 4.1c committee to follow up with each of
>> you to ask your support to allow Fidonet to vote on this policy draft.
>> A copy was sent to the ZC's for distribution in each region.  If you
>> will notify the IC Matt Whelan that you wish to have a vote on the
>> document and send a copy of this message to me our many hours of labor
>> to better Fidonet will be served.  Best regards  Bob Moravsik

    At the time this message was post I was RC of 4:90/0 and I would
answer 'yes' to it. But I couldn't. Why? Becouse Mr. Randy Bush didn't
want to route messages to Zone 4.

  Kids, what's going on? Isn't anybody going to do *anything* about
this?

   To finish this message and make it as smaller as posible take a look
to this:

> 2.1.7  Not Routing Mail

> You are not required to route traffic if you have not agreed to do so.
> You are not obligated to route traffic for all if you route it for any,
> unless you hold a Network Coordinator or Hub Coordinator position.
> Routing traffic through a node not obligated to perform routing without
> the permission of that node may be annoying behavior.  This includes
> unsolicited echomail.
[---------------------------]
> If you do not forward a message when you previously agreed to perform
> such routing, the message must be returned to the sysop of the node at
> which it entered FidoNet with an explanation of why it was not forwarded.
> (It is not necessary to return messages which are addressed to a node
> which is not in the current nodelist.)  Intentionally stopping an
> in-transit message without following this procedure constitutes annoying
> behavior.
[---------------------------]
> In the case of a failure to forward traffic due to a technical problem,
> it does not become annoying unless it persists after being pointed out
> to the sysop.

       Hoping a *real* international Network,
