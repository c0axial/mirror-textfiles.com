     =================================================================
                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================

     In last week's issue I made some  comment  about  how  this  week
     might  be  a special issue devoted to the proposed bylaws.  Well,
     that issue hardly hit the phone lines before I was getting calls.
     At least five people called to tell me  that  that  was  WAY  too
     soon,  and  that  the  bylaws  committee  could  not possibly get
     everything together in time.

     But not Bob Hartman.  He was (or I guess still is)  the  chairman
     of  the  Bylaws  and  Rules  Committee,  and  he  takes that VERY
     seriously.  Oh,  he called me alright,  but all he wanted was  to
     know  what  I  would  need  for a special edition.  He then moved
     heaven and earth (or at least  several  megabytes  of  data  over
     phone  lines)  to  get  it  ready.  From  what  I hear,  he drove
     everyone on the committee mercilessly to get all of the  minority
     reports  and  such  together  for this issue.  He also appears to
     have pleaded with several  people  who  object  to  the  proposed
     bylaws to write up some opposing viewpoints.

     I'd  like to go even farther with this.  If anybody out there has
     any comments at all about the proposed bylaws or anything else in
     this issue,  send a message to 1/1 with a  subject  of  "bylaws."
     I'll  do  another  special issue in a few weeks giving all of the
     comments I've received.  Any and all comments will be  published.
     Many  of  you  will  notice  that this isn't the normal method of
     publishing something in FidoNews.  Usually you have to send us  a
     text message by file attach,  and it has to meet a few (hopefully
     easy to meet) format standards.  You can still send comments that
     way,  of course,  but I'm going to make an exception for this.  I
     want  to  make  it  as  easy  as possible for you to express your
     thoughts.  After all,  this whole dog and pony show is  for  YOUR
     benefit.  It  isn't  worth  a  tinker's damn if it isn't what YOU
     want.

     So, without further ado, I now turn the rest of this issue over
     to Bob Hartman, chairman of the Bylaws and Rules Committee.

     IFNA By-Laws and Rules Committee
     Bob Hartman, Chairperson (132/101)


          Many of you may have noticed that this edition of FidoNews
     is much different than normal.  You may also have asked yourself
     "Why is it different?"  Well, the answer is that this issue is
     devoted to the IFNA By-Laws and Rules Committee's recommendation
     to the Board of Directors.  Now I can hear all of you asking
     "What the heck is he babbling about?"  Let me try to explain:

          What is IFNA? IFNA stands for the International FidoNet
     Association. It is a corporation formed in August in St. Louis,
     Missouri with the purpose of taking some of the financial burden
     Fidonews                     Page 3                   17 Nov 1986


     off of the people that had been running the Fidonet network for
     so long (and not getting any reimbursement for a job well done).
     Ken Kaplan and Ben Baker had been running up large phone bills
     trying to help everyone that had questions about Fido or the
     network. They had also been taking many hours of their time to
     make sure that each week the nodelist got updated and was
     correct. This effort went largely unnoticed by most of us, but
     it was costing them large sums of time and money. They realized
     that they were having problems administering to the needs of
     almost 1000 nodes, and with the nodelist doubling each year they
     knew that there was no way they could keep up with the growth.
     They asked for contributions to help out, and created a
     corporation to collect the money. They then realized that this
     corporation could really help the public in many ways. If enough
     support was garnered, it would be possible to set up ways to
     distribute shareware programs, keep people informed about
     legislation that could effect telecommunications, generate
     mailings about Fido and the Fidonet network, insure Sysop's
     computers against damage, the list goes on and on. They decided
     that if the company was going to be doing all of that, then it
     had to be run by the membership. Well, that created a
     problem...

          In August, the Colorado Springs User Group (COSUG)
     sponsored what was called the Silicon Mountain Fido Sysop
     Conference.  It was a gathering of Fido sysops from all over the
     world (or at least those that could get the time off and afford
     the tickets on short notice).  One of the items that was to be
     discussed was the formation of IFNA.  Since many of the sysops
     present had not heard anything about IFNA, there was obvious
     confusion.  The rumor mill was pumping away.  There were charges
     that Ken and Ben would simply pocket the money, others said it
     could never work, others complained that they were told they
     could vote, and then told that they had to pay $25 to vote.  In
     the end I think that Ken and Ben were simply bewildered by it
     all - they wanted to help the average sysop, not rip him off!
     Anyway, thanks to Ezra Shapiro, things finally settled down a
     little bit.  There was a meeting where it was decided that the
     Board of Directors would be Ken Kaplan, Ben Baker, and Thom
     Henderson.  This Board would serve until January 1, 1987, and
     their charter was to come up with viable Articles of
     Incorporation, and By-Laws to run IFNA. This seemed to be the
     only possible solution at the time.

          About a week later I got a call from Ken Kaplan asking me
     to be the Chairman of the committee responsible for drafting the
     new By-Laws etc.  If I knew then what would happen, I probably
     would have turned him down.  Anyway, I had to come up with other
     people for the committee.  Steve Jordan had left Colorado
     Springs with a very sour taste in his mouth and had written a
     quick and dirty set of bylaws, he was chosen by Ken to be the
     Co-Chairman of the committee.  We then decided to try and find
     one representative from each Region in the nodelist.
     Furthermore, we decided that it would be impossible in the time
     before January 1 to worry about international representation -
     there was not enough time to get the people involved, and the
     Fidonews                     Page 4                   17 Nov 1986


     turnaround time and cost for sending mail was too great.  This
     later turned out to be a bad decision for which I apologize to
     our friends from other countries - all I can say in my defense
     is that it seemed right at the time.  Anyway, the call went out
     for volunteers...

         The first volunteers were Butch Walker, Ken Shackelford, and
     David Drexler.  We still needed others to fill the rest of the
     regions.  I had met Allen Miller, Oscar Barlow and Randy Bush
     while in Colorado, and asked them if they would represent their
     regions.  All told me they would try to find someone else since
     they really didn't feel they would have the time.  I pressured
     each of them by saying that if the committee was going to get
     anything done we had to start quickly - they all succumbed to
     the pressure. We still needed a few more people, so I finally
     asked Ed Rauh, now there were only a few spots left.  Ken Kaplan
     volunteered to be his regional rep, and I told him no way - the
     membership would just not accept his being on the committee, so
     he finally gave me the name of Alex Hartley.  Finally a day or
     two later Tom Marshall, a lawyer from NJ volunteered.  We now
     had a large enough group to go on.  We formed an Echomail
     conference for our use and looked at the issues.  We read SYSOP
     and IFNA conferences every day.  We were making progress, but it
     was too slow.  We decided to have an in-person meeting...

         I made all the plans to have a meeting from Nov 6-9 in
     Nashua, NH.  Ed Rauh, Tom Marshall, Randy Bush, Steve Jordan and
     myself were there for the committee.  We also had several
     interested spectators including Ken Kaplan, Thom Henderson, Rob
     Barker, Bob Morris, and Bill Lyman.  I should point out now that
     these people all paid their own way, and paid for food and
     lodging while there.  They all obviously cared very much about
     this.  Oscar Barlow, Alex Hartley, and Ken Shackelford could not
     attend because of prior commitments, but were in touch by
     telephone and netmail.  They all had their inputs heard by the
     people that did attend.  Anyway, we spent about 50 hours over
     the course of 3 days hammering out the details of what is
     contained in this edition of FidoNews.

          Read on and decide if we did a good job or not...

     IFNA By-Laws and Rules Committee
     Bob Hartman, Chairperson (132/101)

     Introduction, or "What did we want to accomplish?"

          Before getting right into the By-Laws and Articles of
     Association, let me tell you all how we came up with all of this
     stuff:

          First of all, we used two basic models for reference.  The
     first model was that of the US Government.  We wanted regional
     representation not based on population density (like the US
     Senate), and we also wanted to allow the densely populated areas
     to have more say in what happened since it would affect them
     more (like the US House of Representatives).  Our second model
     was the American Radio Relay League which is a corporation very
     similar to IFNA.  There were many parallels which could be
     drawn, and wherever possible we looked at what they had and
     adopted it for use by IFNA.

          Anyway, we sat in a hotel room in the Holiday Inn in Nashua
     for 3 days and brainstormed.  We each had copies of the ARRL
     By-Laws and Articles of Association.  We went through it point
     by point and tried to modify them to fit our situation.  I think
     we were very successful.

     IFNA By-Laws and Rules Committee
     Bob Hartman, Chairperson (132/101)

     "How does this affect me?"

          It amazes me when I find out about sysops that have not
     heard of IFNA!  This affects all of us more than you seem to
     realize.  This corporation is going to be making decisions that
     will affect the way the network is run.  Since each Fido sysop
     connects into the network, that implies it affects each sysop.

          What if you are a user?  In that case this still affects
     you.  IFNA is dedicated to bringing telecommunications to the
     public.  If you are a user, then you are a member of the public.
     It is your duty to ask your sysop if he or she is supportive of
     IFNA.  You should also try to find out the 'why' of their
     decision.  Their choice might affect you in the long run.  IFNA
     is also interested from feedback from users about how to make
     telecommunications more accessible.  Give them your feedback
     about what you would like to see IFNA do for users.  There is no
     reason why users cannot join IFNA.  Associate memberships are
     for anyone that wants to join.  It is not a voting membership,
     but it will get you all of the other services that IFNA has to
     offer.

     IFNA By-Laws and Rules Committee
     Bob Hartman, Chairperson (132/101)

     The IFNA By-Laws and Rules Committee hereby recommends the
     following to the current Board of Directors:

     A. That the articles, bylaws, report, and minutes of these
     meetings, are submitted to the Board of Directors and made
     public to the membership of the network.

     B. That upon submission of this report to the Board of Directors
     that they be open for discussion, comment, criticism, or proposed
     amendment for a period of time to be delimited  by the Board of
     Directors.

     C. That the committee recommends to the Board of Directors that
     it, by whatever means determined to be fair, submit the Articles
     and By-laws, as reported by this committee, to a vote by those
     nodes listed in NODELIST.311 (as per the policy document in
     effect Aug 13, 1986 when IFNA was incorparted in the State of

     are ratified, ammended, or replaced in accordance of such.

     IFNA By-Laws and Rules Committee
     Bob Hartman, Chairperson (132/101)

     What did we leave out?

     Several things were deliberately left out of the By-Laws.  These
     include: How much dues will be for each class of membership?
     How does the Board of Directors operate?  What about
     re-imbursement for expenses?

     All of these things are going to be controlled by the Board of
     Directors in various policy documents.  They will be called
     things like DUES.POL, BOARD.POL, BUDGET.POL, etc.  These
     documents have not yet been completed, but I can say the
     following:

     The dues for Regular Membership will be $25 per year.  Anyone
     paying the $25 before January 1, 1987 will receive a charter
     membership good until December 31, 1987.

     As for re-imbursement of expenses, that is currently not
     feasible since IFNA doesn't have the money to cover expenses
     other than those required to answer the mail, give phone support
     to people that request it, and implement the voting and other
     procedures required by the by-laws.  We deliberately did not
     mention it since it is entirely possible that it could be
     included in a future budget.  We DID mention that the Board and
     Officers would not be paid for their services (as opposed to
     expenses)!

     I am sorry that we cannot say more about the other policy
     documents, but as they become available they will be placed in
     FidoNews and posted in various Echomail conferences.

     IFNA By-Laws and Rules Committee
     Bob Hartman, Chairperson (132/101)


     What if I don't like it?


     That is a very valid question, and is the whole purpose behind
     publishing these documents well in advance of the January 1
     deadline.  There are a number of ways to complain about things
     you don't like:

     1. Enter a message into the IFNA Echomail conference.  This
     reaches the largest number of people, but has the disadvantage
     of being slow, and echomail has been known to get lost.

     2. Send a message to 132/101 telling me what you don't like.
     Please be very specific, and if possible create a file of the
     complaint so that I can incorporate it easily into future
     documents.  If you request an acknowledgement of receipt, I will
     be happy to oblige.

     3. Place a submission to FidoNews.  Unfortunately, this method
     can be even slower than method number 1.

     4. Do all of the above!

     IFNA By-Laws and Rules Committee
     Bob Hartman, Chairperson (132/101)

     Special Thanks

     On behalf of all of the members of the IFNA By-Laws and Rules
     Committee, I would like to extend thanks to the following
     people:

     1.  First and foremost would be the friends and relatives of
     each committee member.  We put in a lot of work on this, and it
     took a lot of our time.  It meant a lot and I would like to
     thank all of the friends and relatives who were so understanding
     during it all.

     2.  The staff at the Nashua Holiday Inn.  These people were
     wonderful.  Each day we would basically trash two hotel rooms
     (littering them with bottles, cans, cigarettes, and munchie
     bags), and each morning they would come back and make it
     spotless.  I would also like to thank the dining room staff
     since they put up with us taking 2 hour breakfasts while paying
     for nothing more than some toast and coffee.

     3.  The people in the Fidonet community that helped us out by
     making constructive comments and supporting what we were trying
     to accomplish.

     Thanks from all of us!

     Alternatives

     As we all know, there are always alternative methods for doing
     things.  This section of FidoNews (COLUMNS) is devoted to the
     alternative methods that have been discussed.  It is important
     that you as a reader inform us as to which method you prefer in
     each case.  If we don't hear anything, then we have to assume
     that the 'default' method outlined in the original documents is
     what you prefer.

     Anyway, on to the alternatives...

     Steve Jordan (102/1301)

     Alternate Method for Voting:

     Present Proposal:  That all members can vote by sending in a
     proxy into a neutral party, presumably a CPA firm prior to the
     annual meeting.  At the annual meeting, any member could
     withdraw his proxy and vote directly.  Any properly registered
     proxies could be voted by the person holding that proxy.  Those
     votes would be tallied and ...

     PRO:  It is backward compatible with Policy2.  It allows members
     to go to the meeting and meet the candidates and select the
     candidate there.

     My proposal:  We mail out a ballot to all members with the right
     to vote.  Those members can select the candidate and mail back
     the ballot with maybe a two envelop method.

     PRO: 1.  It is simpler.  There is no problems with re voting.

     2.  It is more secure.  There are no ballots sitting in an office
     for 60 days.  The ballots do not have to be moved to the
     meeting.

     3.  It is consistent with our structure.  In most ownership
     organizations, the meeting is to elect officers.  Members may
     have 10,000 votes (shares).  They may and can meet with the
     board one and one.  There can be five major stockholders and
     five members of the board.  In membership organization, there is
     no capital stock.  There is no power plays.  The ballots are cast
     by mail.  In fact, I know of no organization other that small
     local ones that elect officers at a national meeting.

     4.  It frees up the national meeting to discuss new ideas,
     directions, and issues.  I can see 1 full day of three being
     politics.  I would prefer 3 full days of business.

     5.  It is cheaper.  The proxy method requires the CPA type to
     certify that the ballots made it there, that the proxies are
     correct.  He must supervise the recall of proxies.  The CPA
     cannot be a "free friend."  He should be hired or else a the
     president or board will be charged with conflict of interest or
     favoritism.

     Cheaper, easier, more professional, more secure, and more time
     efficient.

     CON:  not compatible with Policy2.  Since Policy2 was ignored at
     COSUG I feel that is not a major problem.

     CONCULSION:  My method would make the annual meeting an
     enjoyable, educational, and fun event.  Outsiders and insiders
     do not want to travel thousands of miles to see COSUG.  I want
     the annual meeting to be a highlight.  I want to be proud of
     that meeting.  You must ask yourself, "Do I want another COSUG

     Ed Rauh (141/215)

     Why International?

     The international aspect of the IFNA may have some very serious
     legal ramifications, especially for boards in Europe - and on
     this basis I feel that we should limit IFNA membership to North
     American nodes, at least until the following points are
     clarified for us by IFNA's legal counsel:

     (1) Criminal aspects of the European nodes:

         We publish a list of European Fido boards each week.  Because
     of the very restrictive laws of some European nations (Germany
     in particular), the sysops of those boards are limited to
     operating CCITT protocol modems, which do not communicate well
     with the vast majority of modems in use in North America.  In an
     effort to facilitate communications with us on this side of the
     water, some sysops operate an illegal modem during our NMH.
     This is noted in the nodelist, a freely distributed document, in
     the comments area of those nodes' entries.  In other words, we
     are publishing a list of criminals in Europe, and the best hours
     to catch them at it!

         Other aspects of Fido operation (such as operating in
     Send-Only mode in Canada) may also have legal ramifications for
     non-US Fido sysops.  I am not an expert in International Law;
     other examples of such limitations on Fido operations may exist
     in other countries.

     (2) Ramifications to the IFNA:

     While those sysops in Europe have their necks on the line, we,
     the (potential) North American members of IFNA, also are at
     risk, as is IFNA as a whole.  To some extent we are guilty of
     violations of International Law, and to inciting criminal
     activity outside of North America, a violation that the FCC
     might take action on.  This action could range from a slap of
     the hand, to formal injunctions against IFNA-sponsored
     communications outside of the U.S./Canada, or, under a very
     extreme interpretation of the applicable laws, to prosecution of
     IFNA officers and directors, in particular, the International
     Technical Coordinator.

     At this point I have listed the drawbacks of some of the
     international aspects of IFNA.  It is reasonable to ask what
     should be done about it.  My proposal is very simple:

     PROPOSED:  That Regular membership in the IFNA be limited to
     those countries in which operation of FidoNet-compatible
     software is within the bounds of that nation's laws.

     PROPOSED:  That members of IFNA, for countries where operation of
     FidoNet compatible software may have legal ramifications, form
     their own National FidoNet Associations, which may apply for
     IFNA Region/Division status by:
     Fidonews                     Page 26                  17 Nov 1986


     1.  Informing the International Technical Coordinator of the
     restrictions on FidoNet operations in the applicable nation;

     2.  Proposing a set of By-Laws for that Association's members
     which would allow them to legally operate FidoNet-compatible
     software within their country, to which all their members have
     willingly subscribed.

     I feel that some of our European members may wish to examine
     their advertising of their communications capabilities very
     carefully, and that IFNA may wish to examine the legal aspects
     of some of the listings in the nodelist.  After consulting with
     my attorney, it is not clear that the Nodelist is in violation
     of the law;  someone with more knowledge of that aspect of the
     law (or with more money to throw to their attorney than I am
     willing to feed to mine) should examine these issues.

     Respectfully submitted,

     More proposed changes

     [Editor note - the editor being Bob Hartman this week: Mikey
     sent this stuff to me as comments interspersed in the original
     documents which he received from me.  I extracted the phrases he
     commented on, along with the comments and converted them to
     FidoNews format.  No further editing was done.]

     The following changes were for the By-Laws:

        ALTERNATE: A member of IFNA who is designated by a director.
     The responsibilities of the ALTERNATE include, but are not
     limited to acting as a replacement for the director in any
     instance of the director's absence.

     +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
     comment

     the alternate is to be elected in the same manner as both of the
     directors.

      2. Applications for membership shall be submitted to the
     Secretary. In the case of any applicant whose character,
     reputation or conduct might make him an undesirable member, the
     Secretary shall refer the application to the Executive Committee
     for review; in all other cases, the Secretary shall have the
     authority to grant membership.

     COMMENT --> better definition of acceptable reasons for refusing,
                 as listed, reasons are too loose


      4. Dues shall be set by the Board of Directors, and be payable
     in advance. For members outside the United States, the Executive
     Committee shall assess such additional costs as may be required
     for destinations outside the United States.

     name of any nominee who may be ineligible for election and the
     name of any who may withdraw by written communication. The
     remaining names shall be listed on a ballot, in alphabetical
     order. If there be but one eligible nominee, the Nominations and
     Elections Committee shall declare him elected without balloting
     by the membership. If there be more than one eligible nominee,
     then at least 45 days prior to the ANNUAL MEETING the Secretary
     shall send by mail to every voting member, and publish in
     FidoNews, a ballot listing the candidates for director. The
     ballot shall contain a copy of the current voting rules.

     Article 11 - No person shall be eligible for the office of

     Treasurer, or Vice President - Technical Coordinator, who is not
     eligible in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations

     throughout his term of office.

     ===>  change - United States - to - State of Missouri


     By adding these comments and suggestions I in no way mean to
     imply that I approve of this document or go along with the
     wording be it as origional or as changed.

     I give no one my permission to in any way use my name to imply

     More Comments and Suggestions

     Just a few comments on the By-Laws:
         1. Page 1, item 1a. Really question the PUBLIC ACCESS in
     here. It seems to be dis-enfranchising the private nodes who do
     contribute to the net. I think it would be better to have all
     nodes in the St. Louis Nodelist eligible. Minor, but
     perturbing.

         2. page 4, item 29. Reference to By-Law 36. Should be 32.
     Typo.
     [Ed: Thanks, this has been fixed in this version]

         3. Page 5, item 37c.1. Data Transmitted. Should read Data
     Transmission Format. Don't want to have the standards committee
     responsible for content, just format.

         4. Page 1, item 4. Dues should be labled as payable in US
     currency. In case of overseas nodes, should be payed to regional
     coordinator, who would forward to IFNA in US funds. (They also
     would get a 15-20% better excahnge rate than we would.)

         5. Page 1, item 7. Opinion, comment, and hope to head off
     flames from other sources. Need some words here so that people
     who have a financial or or propriatary interest in IFNA, Fido,
     Seadog, and other software or hardware in use in the net be
     excluded from being an officer. This should only apply to
     commercial(underlined) items that are for sale. This would
     eliminate only people who are making money off the net, such as
     Tom and Thom, but not Bob as his is available for public use. It
     is a small distinction, but could cause some serious flames.

     End Comments, start observations..

     It is a good start. The main problem is that you started with 10
     people, ended up with less, and still took too long. With 20 +
     on the BOD, even less will be accomplished in a longer time. Can
     not think of a way to limit it more fairly than you guys have
     done, but even large Coporations have smaller boards. One from
     each net would be good but again too large. One from each region
     would be better with out the at large members. That way, when we
     go to zones, we could include them or substitute them for the
     regions.
