========================================================================

   The snooze and the net seem to be full of Issues today.  Not
only are there two articles on religious echos, but one against
proselytizing and bigotry.  To top it off, my first message of
the day started with "Emma Goldman was a saint".

   It got me to thinking about how little things have changed.
We have changed the medium, but not the characters.  Eras ago,
we had the Emma's of this world ranged against the Times using
handprinted leaflets; today we have FidoNet ranged against
control freaks. . .speaking of ranges, we do appreciate the mail
sent encouraging FidoNews to remain left justified only.
Metaphorical little bits do byte quite effectively :).

Lighten Up!  "Abort, Retry, Ignore" poem

by Scott Miller,  The Star Board BBS (1:123/416)
Its time to lighten up a bit,  so here is some humor

Here is a bit of humor,  with obvious apologies to Mr. Edgar Allen
Poe.  BTW,  I DID NOT WRITE THIS POEM,  SO DON'T GIVE ME CREDIT!
If anyone knows who wrote this,  please let me know,
he/she diserves credit.

 Once upon a midnight dreary,  fingers cramped and vision bleary,
 System manuals piled high and wasted paper on the floor,
 Longing for the warmth of bedsheets,
 Still I sat there, doing spredsheets:
 Having reached the bottom line,
 I took a floppy from the drawer.
 Typing with a steady hand,  I then invoked the SAVE command
 But got instead a reprimand: it read "Abort, Retry, Ignore".

 Was this some occult illusion? Some maniacal intrusion?
 These were choices Solomon himself had never faced before.
 Carefully, I weighed my options.
 These three seemed to be the top ones.
 Clearly, I must now adopt one -
 Choose : "Abort, Retry, Ignore".

 With my fingers pale and trembling,
 Slowly toward the keyboard bending,
 Longing for a happy ending, hoping all would be restored,
 Praying for some guarantee
 Finally I pressed a key --
 But on the screen what did I see?
 Again: "Abort, Retry, Ignore".

 I tried to catch the chips of-guard --
 I pressed again, but twice as hard.
 Luck was just not in the cards,
 I saw what I had seen before.
 Now I typed in desperation,
 Trying random combinations.
 Still there came the incantation -
 Choose: "Abort, Retry, Ignore".

 There I sat, distraught, exhausted,  by my own machine accosted;
 Getting up,  I turned away and paced across the office floor.
 And then I saw an awful sight,
 A bold and blinding flash of light,
 A lightning bolt that cut the night and shook me to my very core.
 The PC screen collapsed an died,
 "Oh no -- my database", I cried.
 I thought I heard a voice reply,
 "You'll see your data-- Nevermore!"

FidoNews 10-18                 Page:  4                    03 May 1993

 To this day I do not know
 The place to which our data goes
 Perhaps it goes to Heaven where the angels have it stored.
 But as for productivity - well,
 I fear it has gone straight to Hell.
 And that's the tale I have to tell -
 Your choice: "Abort, Retry, Ignore".

Catholic Information Network Announcement

by Richard Walker
Catholic Information Network Availability

Just a quick note to let yall know of a private echomail network called
the Catholic Information Network.  This is a fairly old net, dating
back several years, which I have been gating since early 91; it is
designed as a lay forum to discuss issues relating to Catholicism, and
to provide information to anyone interested in learning more about the
Catholic Church.

Please also note that this is not an open invite to anyone who happens
to feel the need to abuse Catholics or Holy Mother Church; there are
other echos on fidonet which will be more than happy to listen to your
complaints.

The following is a listing of the echomail tags:

GT_CINMAIN         Main conference (for stuff that don't fit others)
GT_ASKFATHER       Ask Father Mateo about Catholic'y kinds of things
GT_ECUMEN          Ecumenical discussion
GT_PRAYER          Prayer requests
GT_ETHICS          Ethical issues (whether religious or not)
GT_CATHBIBLE       Biblical issues from a Catholic perspective
GT_CINSYS          Sysop-only echo for techy questions/support
GT_MEDJUG          Messages from Medjugorge
GT_CATH.YOUTH      Youth issues
GT_CATH.LITURGY    Liturgical things

PARCOM             Parish software (fidonet origination)

Ethics, Main, Bible, and Ecumen have pretty heavy traffic...

Here is the first level of the topology, and a good source for a timely
feed:

            106/960         V.32 V.32bis
                129/75      V.32 V.32bis HST14.4
                130/69      HST
                147/45      V.32 V.32bis
                3625/462

These echos support full IBM-ASCII character sets, ie, line
drawing characters; so if such technology irks you, you are warned.
FidoNews 10-18                 Page:  5                    03 May 1993

Also, note, that the echos preceeded with a GT_ originate on the
GT Network and also have several gates into QWK packet based nets.

1:129/75 calls at least once a day to 1:106/960, so if you have an
HST, feel free to give him a ring.

You may contact me at 1:106/960.0 on fidonet, or 001/060 on the
GT Network.   Compuserve:  71750,3513 and its internet equivalent,
71750.3513@compuserve.com.  (I check fido much more often though...)

Dear madam,

In answer to your article in fidoNews, pleae note the following:

We are talking about a LuxCon/EuroCon, Europe being the
operative world. You are going to be very surprized: there is
something else that the USA in the world. It is usually referred
to as "zone 2". I wish to make it clear since all thru you
article, you refer to the United States. "Here in the States
Best Western this " or the "4th of July", do not apply here. We
ARE NOT the United States and have no wishes to be so.

You don't know what the hotel is like so don't start
complaining. If it is cheap for you - great. Not everybody can
be a millionaire. The hotel was picked because it met the
criteria: conference rooms and not to expensive and close to the
city. FYI 60% of fido nodes in Belgium/Germany/Luxemburg are
below 20.

As for sponsors and speakers, the fact that we are still looking
for some doesn't mean we don't have any. It means that we still
have openings. Period.

The rate is not mentionned - sorry for your US-centrism, but do
you have to make it so plain that you have no idea how to find
what a currency is somewhere else in the world ?

Any speaker that goes to the convention will have to pay an
oversea expense of his own pocket (not so rich anymore ??) -
again, i guess this means we have to import speakers from the
states, we are too stupid to have our own in Europe, right ?

As for the money going to Joho's private account, there again
you have no idea of what it requires to open a bank account for
moral person, accountancy, registers, sales taxes, VAt, etc. Of
course, "here in the States", etc..

To me this is but the manifestation of yet another "ugly
american", incapable of imagining that there might be some other
ways of living than the american way of life.

Online Access to Legislation / MORE PUSH NEEDED

California   Assembly   Bill    1624    would    mandate    that
already-computerized   public   legislative   data  be  publicly
accessible by modem.  The  bill's  sponsor  is  Assembly  Member
Debra Bowen (D-Torrance/Marina del Rey area).

This update reports:
1.  Timing and progress on the bill.
2.  Issues raised in the Rules Committee hearing.
3.  Sponsor's planned changes to the bill.
4.  Much-needed constituent and citizen support-action.

1993 OR BUST

  If  a  committee  votes  against  the  bill, then the proposal
cannot again be introduced by anyone in the Assembly until 1995,
the next two-year session.

BRIEF RULES COMMITTEE HEARING, APR. 19
  The Assembly Rules Committee heard the bill Apr. 19th, chaired by John
Burton (D-San Francisco).  Four people came forward to speak:
    Assembly Member Debra Bowen, the bill's sponsor,
    Ted Laliotis, Los Altos City Council member and former Mayor and
        Director of Emerging Technologies, Hewlett-Packard,
    a woman from Common Cause whose name I failed to get,
    and I, Jim Warren.
But, only Bowen and I were ever permitted to speak.

IMPOLITE DISTRACTIONS

  As  soon as Ms. Bowen began to present her bill and explain it
-- and almost every time she spoke in the ensuing discussion  --
a  man sitting next to Chairman Burton immediately began talking
to the Chairman in much more than a whisper.  I asked later, and
found  he  was  the Assembly's Chief Administrative Officer, Bob
Connelly [an Assembly staff member; not an elected official].

FidoNews 10-18                 Page:  8                    03 May 1993

  Also: At one point, Bowen displayed a file-folder  of  support
letters  and faxes about an inch thick.  No one seemed to notice
or care.

NO ORDERLY PRESENTATIONS

  I had the impression that Bowen  was  not  finished  with  her
explanation when the Chair asked, "How's this going to be done?"
That ended any planned presentations and the  hearing  became  a
random question-and-answer discussion.

USE  THE  INTERNET,  WITHOUT  COST  TO  THE  STATE

  As  technical  questions  arose, I was eventually permitted to
speak, to answer questions.  That gave  me  the  opportunity  to
outline  the  size  and  cooperative  style  of the Internet and
propose that  public  access  could  be  implemented  by  making
legislative  data  available via that 'net, costing the state no
more than a daily  phone  call  --  explaining  what  Bowen  was
proposing.

  After  briefly  outlining  the  Internet,  I  proposed nightly
downloads to one or  several  cooperating  Internet  hosts  that
would  agree  to make the files available to other hosts without
charge to the  state  or  to  the  other  host-  computers.  [by
anonymous ftp]

  I  mentioned  that  the  Legislative  Data Center Director and
Coordinator  had  agreed  they  would  need  no  more   than   a
server-class  computer  to  do  this, and I said a donor machine
could be found if they couldn't afford one.   (needs  to  handle
less than a gigabyte of data for a two-year legislative session;
a "heavy load" in March averaged only 1MB --  one  megabyte  per
day.)

DOUBTS ABOUT COOPERATIVE SHARING

  Several  committee  members  showed  clear  doubts  -- perhaps
disbelief -- that  people  (a)  would  accept  and  store  files
without  charging  for it, and (b) would really permit others to
copy them without charge.  They questioned those ideas  at  some
length.

QUESTIONED MOTIVES OF "FREEWARE" PROGRAMMERS

  They  were further doubtful when I said that, if the data were
available without charge, volunteer  programmers  would  quickly
develop  programs  to  search,  sort, index, cross-reference and
otherwise utilize such data, and many would share  them  without
charge.

  The  notion  of  cooperative  sharing  for  mutual benefit was
clearly a questionable proposal.  There  were  repeated  queries
of,  "Why  would  they do that?" and, "What's in it for them?" I
mentioned civic responsibility, public access  to  the  public's
FidoNews 10-18                 Page:  9                    03 May 1993

legislative  process  and,"Because  it's  there,"  but some were
obviously not convinced.

MAINTAINING INTEGRITY OF DATA

  They expressed serious concerns about downloaded  files  being
modified.   One  mentioned concern that legislators' votes might
be modified to misrepresent their positions.  I said there  were
numerous established solutions to this.

MONEY, MONEY, MONEY

  The most serious concern was whether they could make any money
from this -- especially if any recipients of  the  data  charged
for using it.  This prompted a side-discussion about giving away
copies of bills to constituents versus  selling  them  in  their
"bill room" to lobbyists.

  I  urged that host-computer operators not charging users extra
to use public legislative data not have to pay for it,  but  was
less  concerned  if  the  Legislature  collected  royalties from
information-distributors that  charged  specifically  for  using
legislative  data  --  like Compu$erve's extra charges for using
the OAG (Official Airline Guide).  They  asked  how  they  could
protect  their  data, and I [stupidly] said they might copyright
it but grant free use for those who don't charge extra to use it
while collecting royalties from those who do.  Dumb! -- but they
were clearly getting concerned that someone might make money off
of their data without them sharing it.

BUILD THEIR OWN SYSTEM?

  I recall someone mentioning the possibly of their building and
running their own system to reap  the  profits.   This  was  not
extensively  discussed,  but  it  clearly remains an alternative
that will have to be addressed.

COMMITTEE CONCLUDED; BOWEN PROMISED AMENDMENTS

  Near the end, a minority-party member  spoke  up  strongly  in
favor of the proposal.  He said it was the way of the future and
the legislature should be part of it.  I later found that he was
Ross Johnson, Committee Vice-Chair.

  Chairman  Burton  then looked at me, said to get a memo to him
on this, and declared they'd delay action on it.

  Sponsor Bowen asked that the bill be amended  to  include  the
state codes and state constitution, as well as already-specified
legislative data, and that it cap costs.  (I  requested  several
hundred dollars a month for data-line costs.)

[SOME] MAJOR ISSUES TO BE RESOLVED

  1.  Can they make money selling their public legislative data?
FidoNews 10-18                 Page: 10                    03 May 1993


  2.  Should they set up their own information-distribution system
to do so?

  3.  Can they collect money from those  who  charge  for  using
this  data?   How?   Can they protect it from private for-profit
use (the copyright issue)? [They clearly  dislike  the  idea  of
downloading  the information without cost and then having anyone
profit by selling it.]

  4.  Can the integrity of the data be  assured  if  they  allow
copies to circulate beyond their control?  [They already do, via
current distributers.]

  5.  Would people *really* receive, store and share  the  data,
and  develop  and  share  processing programs, without charging?
For FREE?!!

  6.  They  still  need  better  general  understanding  of  the
Internet -- structurally and operationally.

  7.   If  they  download  to  the Internet, what types of hosts
should be used?  Must they be government-owned systems?

  8.  Should this be studied, reviewed, considered, analyzed and
picked-apart?  [The standard mechanism for delaying or killing a
proposal, sez I.]

  9.  Minor red herring: There are only a few [million]  "elite"
computer  users  who could use this -- and there are suggestions
of some monumentally- expensive public-access alternatives  (IBM
kiosks  in  malls,  800-number  phones  with  information clerks
standing by, etc.).  [Must we wait for them?]

  I've agreed to draft a layperson's outline  of  how  this  can
operate,  and also outline what would be likely if they tried to
build their own system [I cannot envision it being a pretty site
:-)  ].   In this memo, I will address most of the technical and
"cultural" questions posed above,  supplying  references  and  a
variety of contacts.  Suggestions herewith solicited.

ACTION ITEMS FOR THOSE WHO THINK IT'S *OUR* LEGISLATURE & DATA

  The Rules Committee may act on this within a week, or they may
delay it for several weeks.  If they pass  AB1624,  it  is  very
likely  that  it  will  pass  the Assembly and have an excellent
change in the Senate.  But --

  1.   The  Rules  Committee  members  NEED  TO  HEAR  FROM  THEIR
CONSTITUENTS.  NOW!

  2.   And,  they need to hear from volunteers -- not in detail,
nor so they can "choose" them -- but just so they can  begin  to

believe they really exist.

2.  Explicitly request an explicit commitment to support AB1624.

3.  Explicitly request an explanation if they decline to commit to it.

Committee Chair.

  2.  Send one fax/letter to your representative and another one

ACTION FOR OUT-OF-STATERS

  Urge  that  California provide leadership to the other states.
FidoNews 10-18                 Page: 12                    03 May 1993

benefit from free sharing.]

ACTION FOR VOLUNTEERS HOST-ADMINISTRATORS, PROGRAMMERS & SERVER DONORS

  Send a one-page statement volunteering to store and share  the
files  without  charge.   Say  you will develop and freely share
access software if the  data  is  freely  available.   Offer  to
donate  a  server-class machine for downloading legislative data
for  everyone  to  share  freely,  if  they  can't  afford  one.
Volunteer to help their staff install it.

It will be helpful if you will let me what you said, sent or did
-- and what response you received.  [If so, indicate  whether  I
may share it.]

Timely,  economical,  widespread, public, online access to state
legislative information, statutes and constitution, would  allow
the  People  to  participate in their legislative process.  Neat
idea.

SUNDAY MORNING TELEVISION

  by Tyler Wunder, 1:221/279.4
  SUNDAY MORNING TELEVISION

     Like me, if you happen to rise from bed early on a Sunday
morning you can seldom find something on the television that you
really want to see.  Of course, there are a multitude of
television preachers, but who actually watches them?

     Last Sunday morning, I actually sat down and watched one --
specifically, I saw Jerry Falwell hosting the Old Time Gospel
Hour.  And what was Mr. Falwell talking about?  Was he preaching
the love of Jesus?  Was he talking about the scriptures?  Reading
from the bible?  Leading his viewers in prayer, pleading with God
to cure the sick and lessen the suffering of those in pain?

     If Mr. Falwell was doing any of these things, I must have
blinked and missed it, because for the entire segment of the show
that I observed (I must admit, I missed the first ten minutes of
FidoNews 10-18                 Page: 13                    03 May 1993

the program) Mr. Falwell was attempting to sell a $35 video tape
that explained the problems of America as he saw them; the tape
also laid out his proposed solutions to these problems (frankly,
if Mr. Falwell is so concerned with rescuing America and solving
these "problems", I would think that he'd be eager to distribute
the information as widely as possible, free of charge --
certainly, I would like a copy, but I have better things to spend
$35 on).

     In particular, Mr. Falwell seemed extremely concerned with a
piece of legislation that Bill Clinton is apparently going to
sign soon, known as the Freedom of Choice Act.  According to
Falwell, this act will establish homosexuals as a bona-fied
minority, and work to increase their rights within America, and
although Mr. Falwell didn't word it this way, the act will
prevent many forms of discrimination against the homosexual
community.

     Obviously, Mr. Falwell is all for discrimination.  Using the
fear of the "judgement of God" and the destruction of the
American family as motivation, Falwell implores his viewers to
call a 1-900 number in order to have their names placed on a
petition that will apparently be sent to the Whitehouse,
requesting that President Clinton not sign the Freedom of Choice
Act.

     As well, a number is provided for viewers who support the
Freedom of Choice Act.  At first, this surprised me; I almost
thought that perhaps Mr. Falwell was concerned with allowing
everyone to represent their views, whether they agreed with him
or not, until I realized that only the number which represented
opposition to the legislation in question involved a petition.
To call the number supporting the Freedom of Choice Act cost
$1.95/minute like the other number, but no petition was involved.

In reality, to support the Freedom of Choice Act through the Old
Time Gospel Hour seemed rather a useless gesture.

     So why am I telling you this?  Because those who oppose Mr.
Falwell ought to be heard.  Perhaps I'm giving Jerry Falwell too
much credit, but this man frightens me.  His agenda of ignorance
frightens me.  His opposition to the feminist movement (which he
casually ties to witches and lesbianism) frightens me.  His
desire to have institutionalized prayer re-established in the
public school system frightens me.  His wish for the teaching of
biblical Creationism in American public schools, despite the fact
that as a scientific theory biblical Creationism does not exist
("God did it" is not a testable, verifiable/falsifiable
scientific theory -- it is religious dogma, and it does NOT
belong in a science classroom), frightens me.  It frightens me
that Mr. Falwell wishes to have people believe that the
separation of Church and State is a myth, as he believes that the
founders of America were Christians; they were in fact, for the
majority, not Christians at all but Deists -- however, even if
Thomas Jefferson et. al. were Christians, that is no more an
FidoNews 10-18                 Page: 14                    03 May 1993

excuse to make America into a Christian theocracy than the fact
that all the American founding fathers were slave owners gives us
reason to reinstitutionalize slavery.

     The Whitehouse has a Fidonet address.  After watching Mr.
Falwell's hateful propaganda campaign, I immediately whipped off
a letter requesting information on the Freedom of Choice Act.  I
suggest you do the same.  Mr. Falwell has provided a petition for
those who oppose equality, civil rights and privileges for the
gay and lesbian community, yet offers no voice for those who
oppose him (granted, I wouldn't expect him to be that open
minded, but then it makes me wonder why he offers the "support"
1-900 number in the first place).  Fidonet offers you the voice
Mr. Falwell would likely prefer not to be heard.  Write the
Whitehouse (netmail address is 1:2613/333 -- put WHITEHOUSE in
the "To:" field) and request information on the Freedom of Choice
Act if you so desire, but at the very least voice your opinion.

     Frankly, I don't know how much affect Mr. Falwell's petition
can have on President Clinton's decision, but if it can have any
influence at all, then I would implore you to fight Mr. Falwell's
campaign of hate and intolerance.  As citizens of a country that
professes to be free, the moment that the rights of one minority
are overtly oppressed, the rights of all minorities are in
increased jeopardy.  And in some way, we are all in a minority.

     Heaven help you if it's a minority that Jerry Falwell
disapproves of.
