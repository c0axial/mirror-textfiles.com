     Hi Bob,

       Unlike my normal reticent self, I am going to crosspost this
     netmail to Zorch for inclusion in the Fidonews.

       I see the ZC as the 'Chairman of the Board of Directors' of Z1 and
     as the representative of Z1 to the rest of Fidonet. Looking back over
     the past few years I beleive that you have done an outstanding job.
     You have endured a lot of mud-slinging with good humor, and used good
     common sense when making decisions.

       Some people have made accusations that you are a member of a
     conspiracy to control Fidonet. I think that they are wrong for 2
     reasons. The first, and most obvious, is that the man who controls
     the Nodelist already has the tools necessary to do what he wants done
     without the need of a conspiracy. The second is much less obvious to
     most of Fidonet... you are a good and decent man (with an excellent
     sense of humor) and I think such pettiness as they accuse you of is
     too far beneath your dignity to do.

       As you know, I am leaving Fidonet after 11+ years. Please
     understand that if all of Fidonet were more like you I would do
     whatever was necessary to stay.

       Don't shut the door on me, though. We may find out that I can't
     survive without my daily dosage of Fidonet.

       I just wanted you, and everyone else, to know the high regard I
     have for you.

                                 with my highest regards,
                                     Dave

                             Jim Cannell

     What is PGP?  PGP (Pretty Good Privacy (tm), (c) Phillip Zimmermann,
     is a public key encryption program.  What is public key encryption?
     Public key encryption is a virtually tamper-proof method of
     encrypting and/or verifying data.  Unlike conventional encryption,
     which requires a secure channel to exchange keys, public key
     FIDONEWS 15-11               Page 2                   16 Mar 1998


     encryption uses two keys, one of which can be distributed publically
     through insecure channels, while the other is kept in the exclusive
     possession of the owner.

     This article is intended to give the reader sufficient knowledge to
     encrypt/decrypt, sign, and verify integrity of files using PGP.  PGP
     uses two keys, public and secret.  The secret key stays in the owner's
     possesion, and is encrypted with a passphrase known only to the owner.
     The public key can and should be distributed widely in such places as
     the internet keyservers and/or the FidoNet PKEY_DROP Echo.

     First, you need to install PGP on your system.  The PGP archive as
     distributed is named PGP262.ZIP.  Information on where to get PGP is
     included at the end of this article.  The distribution archive
     contains three files: PGP262I.ASC, PGP262I.ZIP, SETUP.DOC.  if these
     three files are not present, throw the archive away, and get another
     copy from a different source.  With PGP, as with any strong encryption
     program, you do not want to take a chance on a corrupt file.  Read
     SETUP.DOC.  It gives you useful information about setting up the
     program.  PGP262I.ASC is a detached signature file for the archive
     PGP262I.ZIP.  Once you get PGP set up, it can be used to verify the
     integrity of the archive. Again, if it doesn't check out, get a
     different archive.

     Now you are ready to actually install PGP.  First, make a directory
     C:\PGP, and add this directory to your path.  Change to this directory
     and run:
         pkunzip -d pgp262i
     The -d option is required.  Unzipping this archive will create a DOC
     subdirectory, which is necessary to run PGP.  After this step, PGP is
     ready to execute.

     The simplest thing that can be done with PGP is to verify the
     integrity of a PGP signed file.  All you need for that is a copy of
     PGP and the signer's public key.  To verify the integrity of a PGP
     signed file named SIGNDFIL.ASC, execute the following command:
         pgp signdfil.asc
     This will create a new file named SIGNDFIL (without the extension).
     The new file will have the signature removed, and PGP will tell you if
     the signature is good or bad.  If even one bit in the file has changed
     after it has been signed, PGP will tell you that the signature is bad.

     Perhaps you want to ensure that those receiving a file know that it
     was written by you, and that it has not been modified.  This is done
     by signing the file.  Again, this is a simple operation.  Just execute
     the command:
         pgp -s yourfile.ext
     PGP will ask you to enter your passphrase.  After you do this, PGP
     will add your signature to a new file named YOURFILE.PGP.  This works
     well for binary files, but if your original file was a text file, you
     will notice that the signed file is unreadable.  Don't despair, the
     recipient will still be able to verify the signature, and read it.  If
     you really want the text readable before the signature is verified,
     use the command:
         pgp -sat yourfile.txt
     After entering your passphrase, PGP will create a new file named
     FIDONEWS 15-11               Page 3                   16 Mar 1998


     YOURFILE.ASC, which has your original plaintext bounded by the PGP
     delimiter lines, and a signature attached.  You have probably seen
     this format as signed messages in some Echos.  This can be a quite
     useful tool for moderators who have a problem with others sending
     moderator messages.  A PGP signature cannot be forged, thus assuring
     the reader that the message really is from the moderator.

     Now you are probably wondering how to get the PGP key pair used to
     sign the file.  This is also a simple operation.  Enter the command:
         pgp -kg
     PGP will offer you three choices of 384, 512, or 1024 bits.  You may
     also enter a value for the number of bits up to a maximum of 2047.
     For PGP to be effective, do not use a key length shorter than 1024
     bits.  You will then be prompted to enter a user ID for your key.  Any
     text string will work, but it should be something meaningful.  For
     example, the ID string on my key is:
         Jim Cannell <jim.cannell@f21.n306.z1.fidonet.org>
     Next, you will be prompted to enter your passphrase.  The passphrase
     can be a long sentence or phrase with numbers and/or punctuation marks
     included.  It can be any length, but should be limited to 128
     characters if you are running MSDOS or a similar OS.  To be secure, it
     should contain a mix of upper and lower case characters along with
     numbers and punctuation marks.  The words in it should be badly
     misspelled, and be utter nonsense.  Any meaning should be recognizable
     only to yourself.  Make sure it is something that you can remember
     without ever writing it down.  After you enter the passphrase, you
     will be asked to enter it again for verification.  Next you will asked
     to enter some random text.  Then, the actual key generation process
     will begin.  This process is quite lengthy, even on a fast computer,
     but fortunately, you only have to do it once.  The key pair that you
     just generated will be in your PGP directory in the files PUBRING.PGP
     and SECRING.PGP.

     Now that you have your own PGP key, you need to take steps to protect
     it.  First, sign your key.  This is done with the command:
         pgp -ks youruserid
     After you have signed it, make at least one backup copy of both
     PUBRING.PGP and SECRING.PGP and store it in a secure place somewhere
     offline.

     Next, you need to publish your public key.  To do this, first extract
     it from your keyring with the command:
         pgp -kxa youruserid keyfile
     This creates a file named KEYFILE.ASC.  For your own key, make this a
     unique file name.  For example, my keyfile is named CANNELL.ASC.  Post
     your keyfile as a message in the PKEY_DROP Echo, upload it to the
     internet key servers, and make it file requestable on your system with
     the magic name PGPKEY.  Encourage your correspondents to freq it.  You
     need to distribute this key as widely as possible.

     To encrypt a file for a given recipient only, run:
         pgp -e pvt_file.ext hisuserid
     This will create a file named PVT_FILE.PGP, which can only be read
     by the recipient.  When he gets it, he executes the command:
         pgp pvt_file.pgp
     PGP will ask him for his passphrase, and if it is correct will decrypt
     FIDONEWS 15-11               Page 4                   16 Mar 1998


     the PVT_FILE.PGP into the plaintext file, PVT_FILE.  Note that when
     you encrypt a file with PGP, no one but the recipient can decrypt it;
     you won't even be able to decrypt it yourself.

     This article should be sufficient to allow you to use PGP for its
     simpler tasks.  To really discover  how versatile this program is,
     read the included documentation.  It is quite well written.  I plan on
     this being the first of a series of articles on PGP.  In future
     articles, I will describe how to do some of the more complex functions
     of PGP, such signing other people's keys, revoking keys, multiple IDs,
     multiple recipients, the web of trust, and more.

     At the very least, the information in this article will enable you to
     determine whether or not your copy of this issue of FidoNews has been
     altered or censored since its publication by the Editor.

     There are many places to obtain PGP.  It is available for freq at
     1:306/21 with the magic name PGP.  The source code is available with
     the magic name PGPSRC.  There is an ftp site at MIT, but you will be
     required to prove that you are a US or Canadian resident before being
     allowed to download.  Thanks to the shortsighted US government, strong
     cryptographic protocols are considered munitions, and as such, their
     export is prohibited.  Since I have an allergy to steel bars on my
     door, I must limit freqs to Zone 1 systems.  If you want a copy,
     NetMail me from a Zone 1 address, and I will give you the password
     necessary to freq PGP.  Although the US government has prohibited the
     export of PGP, it is freely available throughout the world anyway.  In
     fact, every version of PGP has been available at overseas locations
     within minutes of its release.  For those of you in other zones, I
     suggest that you first try to obtain PGP from 2:51/2.  There are
     probably other locations closer to you that I am not aware of.

     I invite you to join us in the PUBLIC_KEYS Echo to learn more about
     PGP and encryption.  Both PUBLIC_KEYS and PKEY_DROP are international
     Echos distributed on several backbones in all six FidoNet zones.

     If you have any questions, comments, etc., you can contact me in the
     PUBLIC_KEYS Echo or via NetMail at 1:306/21.  Happy PGPing.

     News Flash!! FidoNet has gone back into action, with people leaving
     the Internet to go back to where they started. Hundreds of people are
     storming back to the older network, by 1,000's and the nodelist is
     growing out of control. Zones 1 & 3 have gained nearly 65,000 entries
     together.

     Okay.. Perhaps I'm dreaming, but with a little bit of work, we can
     get our existing network to 'network'. Why did everybody leave
     FidoNet?  The World-Wide-Web.. And what can FidoNet offer people
     FIDONEWS 15-11               Page 5                   16 Mar 1998


     using the existing services.. The World-Wide-Web, well a slight
     diversion from the real Web.. a thing I like to call SuperText.

     SuperText is FidoNet's WWW. Let's say the base host for SuperText is
     3:635/725, and the SysOp decides to put up three pages, one
     advertising his BBS (advert.stp), one about oil refineries
     (oilref.stp), and lastly, one about himself (me.stp).

     The SysOp opens up the SuperText door, goes into the E)dit Pages
     section, and uploads the new .stp's into his SuperTextSpace. They get
     zipped into the database, frozen and the new entries are exported in
     Netmail for delivery to the next SuperText uplink.

     Days later, it has been updated world-wide, and everybody can access
     his pages (in a flash) by opening the SuperText door, going into
     V)iew Pages, and typing in "centralbbs.mel.au/advert.stp" which would
     bring up his BBS advertisment.

     SuperText will work. But there is a few obvious limitations with this
     design. Firstly, hard disk space is one -- however, it'll take a heck
     of alot of pages to fill an average 10MB free space up (considering
     they're compressed -- text files compress extra good!).

     I've already created a UNIX prototype of SuperText, which seems to
     work well, but I need your help to continue development. I need
     people to write MEX scripts, and doors, and stuff for SuperText, and
     possibly an offline reader like Bluewave for SuperText.

     If you can help with this new promising innovation, please send me
     netmail, "Michael Strates @ 3:635/725" or e-mail
     "mstrates@croftj.net".

     Dear EditorBeing,

     This article is submitted by Charles Herriot(163/110) who
     discovered Logger hunched over a threadbare copy of the
     "Bride of Frankenstein" whose title had been crossed out and
     replaced with the words "Policy 4." Logger was wearing a
     "Zorch for IC in '98" button in his left lapel (and, a
     "Clinton for Pope in 2000" button in his right lapel.)

     Roll da flic, Zorch....

     Dear Reverend Visage,

     Where the hell are you? I must tell you that the editors of
     Swamp Swine Magazine have become overly concerned about your
     recent submission of petty cash vouchers. I somehow doubt
     that they want to be the proud owners of some prime real
     estate located on the Whitewater River in Arkansas, even if
     Whitewater happens to have the historic value of being the
     only place in the universe where Slick Willy kept it in his
     shorts.

     I trust you noticed that this month's issue of Rolling Stone
     has several incoherent column inches from that toothless old
     troll, Hunter S. Thompson? I fear that the poor sod has
     skidded off the Proud Highway and now lies blubbering in the
     ditch. I shall burn a few LeeAnne Rimes CDs as an
     appeasement to the gods that must be torturing his hollow
     soul.

     At the risk of sending you even further to a life of drink,
     loose cars and fast women, I should tell you that the bad
     craziness in Region 12 continues to amuse. Our RC, Mike
     O'Connor lumbered up onto his hind paws and informed the
     net163 NC to "clean up the nodelist" or else all of the net
     would sink below the Pacific. Mike "Weasels R' Us" O'Connor
     made this threat by invoking the name of Bob "ZC for Life"
     Satti. Naturally, the NC163 flexed a spine of purest jello
     and caved in to Mike's demands. Much embarrassment all
     around when it was discovered that Bob "ZC for Life" Satti
     had made no threat and that the whole brouhaha was a product
     of Mike's fertile, bootlicking imagination. Triples all
     round at the Z1REGCON echo, and may the farce be with them.
     (Hint: When whispering the name "Z1REGCON" around Bob Kohl,
     be sure to wear asbestos underwear because he strains a few
     headgaskets at the concept that Fidoserfs would ever learn
     of the SuperSecret FidoGod echo.)

     This week's Chautauqua springs from a fascinating book
     called "Witch Hunt, A True Story of Social Hysteria and
     FIDONEWS 15-11               Page 7                   16 Mar 1998


     Abused Justice" by Kathryn Lyon. Lyon asserts that there
     have been three major bouts of legal hysteria in the U.S.
     The first and second were the Salem Witch Trials, and
     Mccarthyism. The third and ongoing witch hunt concerns the
     area of prosecutions for sexual abuse. She details the
     outrageous behaviour of various Wenatchee, Washington
     police, social workers, etc. who charged 41 people with
     offenses based upon the principle testimony of a 4 year old
     girl. The girl was browbeaten into making the claims by a
     deranged police detective and the stories defied logic and
     physical possibility. The author takes pains to point out
     that sexual abuse is a problem, that real incidents are
     horrific and abhorrent, but what is even more frightening is
     that the accusations of abuse have become a new realm where
     lives are ruined and grudges settled by malign individuals.

     What makes the Wenatchee story so provocative is that the
     zealotry of the police extended to persecuting the critics
     of their methods. Simple concepts like presumption of
     innocence fell by the wayside, and the same hysterical fears
     engendered by McCarthy kept decent people from voicing their
     repugnance at the police methods. What really jolted me as I
     read the book was that I realized that the occurrence wasn't
     a Kafka fiction - but rather a very real story taking place
     in 1995 in the theoretical heartland of the civilized world.
     Even discounting the hyperbole that attends the Excited
     States' head-patting about their Constitutional freedoms, I
     had assumed that they paid more than lip service to rights
     and due process. This book is scary reading.

     What makes this Chautauqua somewhat relevant to Fidoland is
     the notion that freedom is a perilously fragile commodity.
     It takes very few individuals with presumptive powers to cow
     the gullible, the brainless and the gutless into submission.
     The recent silliness with respect to net163's nodelist is a
     case in point, where a few socially maladroit complainants
     have somehow gotten the ear of Fidogods. Why is it that the
     skirl of martial bagpipes seems to goad *C-beings into
     flexing power? Why do *C-beings suddenly become morons and
     lose sight of basic notions of due process and freedom of
     expression?

     On that cheery note I must go, Visage. Your secretary is
     braying like a hippo in estrous. Who'd have thought that her
     psychic balance could be so unsettled by the fact that I
     left her a joke fax purportedly from Kenneth Starr - asking
     her to submit her bra for serology testing. Your secretary
     is not a well woman Visage,and it may not be wise to include
     her on the guest list for the upcoming nuptials of Zorch and
     John.

     hello
     i want to get in contact with somebody that can provide me the
     FidoNet backbone for free, because here in the Region 53 (2:53*/*) we
     are isolated from the outer Fido.  I wish that you post my request in
     a FidoNews article, or Letter to the Editor, and please, i want to
     inform you that i can provide the 2:53*/* backbone to romanian people
     in USA, through Fido2Int and/or e-mail.

     Thank You.

     PS: if somebody offers the fidonet backbone for free, please tell
     him/her to contact me at jokerul@psi.lbi.ro, tzeapa@usa.net ,
     fidonet@maxutils.com,  radu.malica@contact.pcnet.ro, or at 2:530/139
     on the Fidonet. Thank you again
