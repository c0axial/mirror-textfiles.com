     Well my little disclaimer last week about not permitting Fidonews
     to become an arena for scrappy postings, got me notified very
     quickly about freedom of speech, censorship, and even the banner
     of Fidonews proclamation: "Newspapers should have no friends" by
     Joseph Pulitzer.

     Also other Zones apparently want to see us at our task of electing
     a new Z1C. Some resented my omitting the comments of combatants and
     the heated discussions on the procedures and implementation.  For
     any that do not like intenseness of some discussions, bear in mind
     that the election will be over very soon and hopefully we'll all be
     drawn back together under a happier hobby by Christmas. <chortle>

     I've tried to stay clear of comments on this "ZC Election Procedures"
     because I have warm friends on both sides of the issue; but the above
     rebuttal is so clearly and simply worded, explaining Policy4 and the
     only "right to vote" being with the RCC, I have to agree with both of
     your statements about it.  I don't understand the animosity toward
     Dallas' stand on the policy like he is wrong.  As I have said many
     times, change P4!

     Until P4 is modified, no sysop vote is enforceable on the *C, no
     matter what the sysop vote may be. A simple change P4 deleting the
     word RCC and replacing with SYSOP, may change the battle ground. We
     can have all of the "Sysop elections" we want, but they are
     meaningless unless the RCC happens to agree with the outcome. You
     rather "we" need to put a zonal policy in place regarding elections,
     because you will never get P4 itself changed in my opinion.

     Anyhow Dave, work on the problem of an addendum or modification of p4,
     not on the individuals each trying to keep the ol' fido-buss on the
     road in their own way.  Stewart H had an idea he thought would solve
     some of this.

     He perhaps did not have time to refine it enough to keep some of us on
     board. The idea had merit, but didn't have the clear cut verbiage
     defining his intent for the list. Thus, later several withdrew their
     names, not because they did not prefer a sysop vote, (most do), but
     because it did not define how it could be done under present policy,
     or how policy could be circumvented for list use in a sysop election.
     Catch 22.

     Do you blame the tools for the ineptitude of the mechanic? Do you
     blame the pistol for the cop who shot an unarmed man? The policy is
     just /words/. What we make of it is entirely up to /human beings/,and
     to rail uselessly against a collection of words is sheer foolishness.

     Region 12 thought they had found a better way, but as it's been
     clearly shown, someone found a way in their system to go against the
     wishes of the sysops of that region as well.

     Opportunity is where you find it; as a lawyer you ought to be very
     aware of that. No document, rule or law is without loopholes that can
     be exploited for the wrong purposes. Change the rule, change the law,
     change the document, but don't throw it out just because some
     self-serving idiot abused it.

     All they could do was complain about it.

     There's nothing in P4 about an RC being elected either.  Given that,
     you unelect the offender and elect a new one.  You may not have enough
     time but you can at least make an attempt.

     DH> But cheer up, now we have an "election guideline" that paraphrases
     P4 using words that have been redefined. NOW, they can't even
     complain!

     That's still something available to the sysops.

     DH>In fact, the process is better than having the RC appointed whether
     the RC is accountable or not.

     SH> I happen to believe in an RC's accountability more strongly than I
     worry about how he got there.

     DH> Excellent. We're in complete agreement. Except for the mechanism.
     Where is YOUR guarantee of accountability defined? Ours is in our
     policy of holding annual RC elections by sysop.

     What would you do if your incumbent RC said "Screw you.  Your right to
     vote an election has been eliminated."

     DH> Utterly. He's just asked us if we want him to vote at all for ZC.
     He stated that he is opposed to this "sham" but will be happy to
     vote if we so instruct him.

     And will someone poll all of your nodes?

     DH> Why don't you just ask them? Ruth posts right here in this echo.

     She reads these posts.

     DH> Uh, yeah. What did YOU mean by "democratically?"

     Open elections without the fix being in.  The last go around, I was
     still a NC and polled my nodes.  They did not respond so they lost
     their votes which was their choice.

     Take care,

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     DS> Where did I say "majority of Zone 1" as you've quoted above?

     You're implying "a vast majority", but that's a shadowy quote,
     intended to make it sound like a real majority of Z1, which it isn't
     at all.  You might want to make it clear that it's the "vast majority
     of all 20 (or whatever) sysops that bothered to reply".  Now, compare
     that with the number of about 1800 or so total Z1 sysops, and it's
     really a tiny sampling, and not enough to be truly representative of
     any "sysop feelings" in Fidonet.

     When you can come back with a sampling of, oh, let's say 1/2 of the
     sysops (900ish), then you'll be a heck of a lot closer to a true "what
     the sysops think".  Until then, you're merely projecting your feelings
     onto the face of Z1 Fidonet at large.

     DS> Is this actually a quote or did you fabricate it?

     Nope, it was my own quote, based on what I see as your implication of
     the result of this "poll".

     DS> What did the RCC do? Stomped it out. A bully can only step on...

     GG> Umm, this "poll" didn't complete until the current election

     DS> That's not true

     Yes it is.  If anything, they both happened right about the same time.
     I *do* notice that you don't mention that our current Z1C told the
     "Election Coordinator" to "go ahead" with this election, and I wonder
     why that is. <shrug>

     DS> Don't tell me you're losing mail too. Sheesh.

     Nope, my feed is just fine, thanks.

     Really? Perhaps you should sit and have a chat with your Secretary of
     State. I find it absurd that she hasn't recursed herself after having
     courted an ambassadorship or cabinet post from one of the candidates
     and contributing a not insubstantial amount of her own personal
     fortune to that same candidates campaign. Sheesh... talk about a real
     conflict of interest. Luckily there are courts in FL that don't seem
     to have the same conflicts.

     The real world is this is a hobby. People who volunteer to help the
     rest of us shouldn't be penalized for having the stupid gene that
     allows them to volunteer. I can't think of anyone that would be
     persuaded simply because a zone ballot clerk noted the name of someone
     who in the ballot clerk's personal opinion would likely be a good
     candidate. I also note that not a single person jumped on the not so
     subtle suggestion and that Janis remains in the same status that she
     had before (actually in a worse position because now any nominations
     for her will be scrutinized).

     CS> Or she (grin).  In my region, it's even in the regional policy and
     has been since 94.  (R13 was one of the earliest to go to voting in
     the RC/REC, but not sure if they were the first).  10% of the sysops
     or 20% of the NC's.  I represent my region by *choice* but I didn't
     and they wanted another, they can vote me out PDQ!

     Our EM (our name for regional voting officer, an elected position) is
     looking over a draft (second one) based on our voted 'policy' and
     adapted for this, and if it's workable, he'll adapt as needed and let
     everyone know.

     Simple version:  Sysop-wide in region (just like all our elections
     have been), 'weighted voting' (takes time to explain but it's a little
     like the Z1EC election idea, cast in order of your preference), EM
     casts any tie votes for RC if needed (an adaption as I may have
     results from other regions already so I asked the region if they
     minded that being delegated and no one piped up with an objection).

     Carol.

     An elections officer (returning officer) has a responsibility to make
     sure everyone feels that they are eligible to run, and to ensure that
     there is a fairly good slate of candidates to chose from, even if it
     means encouraging people to run.  But it shouldn't just be one person,
     she should be suggesting a dozen or so good candidates.  Impartiality
     would suggest that she should suggest at least three, with widely
     differing viewpoints.

     ml>> 1. P4 is the policy of the organization.

     DS>Interesting. How and when did that happen? What was the vote count?
     Please provide references.

     RC> Since you werent alive when some of Canada's Federal laws or
     Ontario provincial laws were in place, does that mean they are not in
     effect or do not apply to you?

     He made the claim that P4 is the policy of the organization. I've
     asked him to prove it. Has nothing to do with when anyone was alive.

     If you mean to suggest that Fidonet gave it's elected officials a
     mandate to erect the laws of Fidonet, just as the citizens of our
     countries did with their elected officials, again I would ask for
     proof of this. It has never happened in Fidonet to the best of my
     knowledge. The best I have seen in this regard is local policies for
     nets and regions and those policies apply only to those nets and
     regions.

     As you know, we've been down this road many times before, and the
     FIDONEWS 17-49               Page 8                   27 Nov 2000


     proof of P4's validity as the law of the land simply isn't there. What
     did happen was that a group of RCs tried to force *their* self-created
     policy document onto the sysops of Fidonet without a mandate to do so
     and that policy was never formally accepted by the Sysops even to this
     day. There has always been substantial resistance to this action by
     the RCs from many of Fidonet's sysops. All it has done is create hard
     feelings and division, some that accept P4 and some that don't. We've
     heard arguments on both sides of the debate and many of those
     arguments are good ones. But until Fidonet Sysops agree one way or the
     other, P4 just cannot be deemed the law of the land. It is, at best,
     an old, stale, guidelines document. Not even of much value there. The
     odds of ever getting proper ratification of P4 is slim to none, and
     for good reason.

     There is another problem. Those of us that have net and/or regional
     policies may have alienated some sysops that may not have agreed with
     the those policies, even though they received majority approval of the
     sysops of those nets or regions. Such is the nature of democracy.
     Those sysops had options, one of which was to move to another net or
     region where they could be free of policies they did not agree with.
     We have both seen this happen. Were we to try to establish a zone or
     Fidonet-wide policy that looked anything like P4, what would be the
     options for sysops that did not agree with it? Move to another zone or
     leave Fidonet? Once you get past net and regional policies you run a
     very real risk of alienating too many sysops to the detriment of
     network. In my opinion we're moving too far down this slippery slope
     and losing site of the idea that this hobby is just that, a hobby.
     These actions on a large scale can be damaging.

     Laws are necessary in society to protect citizens and their property.
     When was the last time a Fidonet sysop stuck his or her hand through
     your monitor screen and tried to lift your modem? :) I'm not saying
     there is no value in policy. There is. But it depends on what that
     policy is. A hobby such as ours has been policed to death. It is small
     wonder so many sysops ignore policy. In my opinion a successful policy
     must have the following traits: 1) It must be formally agreed to by
     the majority of those sysops it will affect, 2) it must be flexible
     and changeable enough to deal with changing circumstances, 3) it must
     cover only issues that are truly important, and 4) it must be a
     sysops' policy, not a policy that establishes a ruling class.

     When RCs as a collective (the RCC), and without a sysop mandate, try
     to force things onto sysops, it is a mistake. This is in sharp
     contrast to regions like ours that DO have a sysop mandate to create
     the policies that affect our regions. I have no quarrel with properly
     mandated actions and I doubt that you do either. However, I believe
     you made the point that if we were to try to force our regional
     policies onto sysops outside of our regions we would be wrong to do
     so. It is just as wrong to force this (non)election onto the sysops of
     Zone 1. Presenting arguments is fine, as it allows sysops to decide
     the issues for themselves. But for RCs to ignore those sysop-made
     decisions by forcing their will onto the sysops it is not fine. We
     clearly need a mandate, which leads to my next point.

     A poll was conducted and the vast majority of sysops in Zone 1 that
     responded to the poll wanted true sysop-level voting for this

     election. Why have the RCs ignored that mandate in favour of trying to
     force their own election rules onto the zone's sysops? Worse, they
     added insult to injury by trying to force their own election rules
     onto the zone's sysops by also trying once again to force their own
     policy document onto the zone's sysops. A mandate for neither has ever
     been established. This is abusive RCC behavior.

     The RCC have been guilty of at least six actions that have been
     harmful and divisive to this network. 1) Most importantly, they have
     ignored the mandate (or lack of one) of the sysops, 2) without a
     mandate, they have tried to force their policy document onto the
     sysops, 3) without a mandate, they have tried to force election rules
     onto the sysops, 4) without a mandate, they have attempted to combine
     the above actions in an attempt to further force the sysops, 5)
     without a mandate, they have placed their self-interest ahead of the
     interests of the sysops, and 6) without a mandate, they have attempted
     to set themselves up as their own electorate.

     The RCC do not have a mandate from Zone 1 sysops to do any of the
     above. They need that mandate, otherwise they are simply a
     self-serving entity with no redeeming value to the zone.

     This Z1C (non)election is wrong on all counts.

     Hello All!

     I have been asked to relay for following regarding the Z1C Election...

     1) Regional policies apply regionally only. They do NOT affect the RCC
     body, therefore regional policies do not apply to any election rules
     implemented by the RCC.

     2) If all RCs must agree to sysop-level voting, then _ALL RCs_ must
     agree to any and all forms of voting, including RC-voting on a
     sysop-representational basis. Since R12C is NOT in agreement with the
     current election scheme, the current election must not proceed and
     must be halted immediately.

     Notwithstanding points #1 and #2, the RCC must clarify, and justify,
     to the sysops of Zone 1 the following:

     3) Clarify and Justify to the sysops of Zone 1 the difference between
     election draft A and election draft C.

     4) Clarify and Justify to the sysops of Zone 1 why election draft A
     was rejected solely for the purpose of preventing all sysop-level
     votes from determining the outcome of the election.

     5) Clarify to the sysops of Zone 1 that the sysops that did express
     opinions on the current election scheme were not aware of the previous
     points, and that these previous points meant the removal of of the
     right to vote from all Zone 1 sysops.

     Hi Jerry.

     RA> Not really. In the above example, there would be 6 opposing votes
     who could have revised the draft to something similar to version A and
     passed it.

     JS> The simple fact (regardless of what anyone might desire) is that
     the status quo is in accord with P4, and didn't really require
     ratification. It's just a schedule, with a set of recommendations
     which (as we all know) is not binding on the RCs.

     First, I would think it would require ratification if only as to all
     the wording, dates, etc. Second, many sysops don't understand it is
     not binding on the RCs. Even in just reading this one echo, you will
     note that some are thinking that their regional vote is binding on
     their RCs when it is not.

     JS> If 6, 7, or 9 of us had been in favor of sysop-level voting we
     would still have had no way of binding ANY RC, regardless of how they
     voted in the matter of election rules, to follow the results of a
     plebiscite.

     While they may be true, those 6, 7 or 9 could vote as the sysops chose
     and the Z1C would be elected by an absolute majority.

     JS> It is being argued that the current rules do not force the RCs to
     conduct plebiscites and vote according to the results. In point of
     fact, neither did version "A." There is no enforcement mechanism
     available.

     Only the word of the RCs involved. As someone here stated, "if the
     sysops of a region cannot trust their RC, that RC can/should be
     removed by the regional sysops."

                  How the Grinch Stole Election Day
                   By Frank Cammuso and Hart Seely
                (With respects to Theodor S. Geisel.)

     Every Chad
     Down in Chad-ville
     Liked voting a lot ...
     But the Grinch,
     Who lived just north of Chad-ville
     Did NOT!

     The Grinch hated voting! He thought it a bore.
     Now, please don't ask why. Could be Bush, could be Gore.
     It could be his heart bled with liberal mush.
     It could be, perhaps, that he listened to Rush.
     But I think the real reason his trust was so shattered
     Was the great Grinchy view that his vote never mattered.

     BUT Whatever the reason,
     Lack of trust, lack of goals,
     The Grinch dreaded that day when Chads went to the polls.
     He just hated those speeches and negative ads,
     And when push came to shove, he just hated the Chads.
     He just hated their theme parks, their football-team rooters,
     He just hated their gun laws, their barmaids at Hooters.
     He just hated their weather, even hated their hate.
     And he hated that they were a battleground state.

     "So they're making their choices," he snarled with a sneer.
     "This 'Decision Two Thousand' is practically here!
     "They'll struggle to choose 'tween a crumb and a bum,
     "'Cause a voter's a voter, no matter how dumb."
     Then he growled, his Grinch fingers nervously drumming,
     "I MUST find a way to keep outcomes from coming!"

     For tomorrow, he knew ...
     All the flag-waving souls,
     Would again waste their efforts on Clintons or Doles.
     And by then, oh, the polls! Oh, the polls! Polls! Polls! Polls!
     That's the one thing he hated! The POLLS! POLLS! POLLS! POLLS!

     So the Chads, rich and poor, and by bus, car, or boat,
     They would vote! And they'd vote!
     And they'd VOTE! VOTE! VOTE! VOTE!
     They would vote to ban smoking or clearing your throat.
     They would even vote laws in for curbing your goat.

     And THEN ...
     They'd sing that anthem. It always came later.
     Be they Bush-ites or Gore-ites or ites of Ralph Nader.
     FIDONEWS 17-49               Page 13                  27 Nov 2000


     They'd stand close together, and though still full of fight,
     They'd stand and they'd sing, by that dawn's early light.

     And the more the Grinch thought of Election Day's ring,
     The more the Grinch thought, "I must stop this whole thing!
     "Why, for two hundred years I've put up with it now!
     "I MUST stop these outcomes from coming!
     "... But HOW?"

     Then he got an idea!
     Yes, a legal idea!
     THE GRINCH
     GOT AN AWFUL BUT LEGAL IDEA!

     "I know just what to do!" The Grinch laughed with a jig.
     And he wove from his goat a Sam Donaldson wig.
     And into the mirror he spoke with grand rancor,
     "With this helmet of hair, they'll all think I'm an anchor!"
     "All I need are some ballots ..."
     The Grinch looked around.
     But since ballots were private, there were none to be found.
     So he made his own ballot, printing letters quite little,
     And he scattered the names, running holes down the middle,
     And he stuck it together with Chad-berry spittle.
     And he said, "They'll need Einstein to figure this riddle!"

     THEN
     He loaded his boxes, and without looking nervous
     Put a sign on his van that said "Voter News Service."
     THEN
     The Grinch pulled away in his van with a screech
     Toward the pads of the Chads in a place called "Palm Beach."

     When he came to the first polling place in the square,
     All the lines were quite long. Thoughtful talk filled the air,
     As the Chads chatted merits of managed health care.
     "Vote early and often," the Grinch said with a grin.
     And he marched to the front of the line and stepped in.

     There he left all his ballots, the strange ones with punches,
     And instructions that said, "Please punch punches in bunches."
     As he slunk out the door toward the nearest Grand Hyatt,
     He could hear what you'd think was an Eli=E1n riot.
     The Cohens sisters Esther, Mitzi, and Shannon,
     Just realized that their votes had all gone to Buchanan!

     At a place in Dade County near a middle-school yard,
     The Grinch donned a shirt that said, "Polling Place Guard."
     And he eyeballed each Chad and said, "Where is your card?
     "Voter card? Motor card? Credit card? Diner's?
     "Face card? Race card? Baseball card? Shriners?"
     And he turned them away. Then the Grinch, like a fox,
     Stuffed all of his ballots and locked the lockbox!

     Then old Grinch returned home to go "LIVE" on TV.
     He had waited quite late: (It was now eight oh three.)
     FIDONEWS 17-49               Page 14                  27 Nov 2000


     So the Grinch Network News first projected a score:
     "Now with one percent in, we pick Chad-ville for GORE."
     Every Gore-ite in Chad-ville said, "GIVE US SOME MORE!"

     So he pulled more projections straight out of his stack.
     Then, "Oh, dear!" said the Grinch, "I must take it all back!"
     So the Grinch Network News, in grand fairness to all
     Now reported that Chad-ville was "TOO CLOSE TO CALL."

     "Don't be mad, all you Chads, for this isn't a scandal,
     "It was just," the Grinch said, "we forgot the Panhandle.
     "The science of sampling can leave one out-simpled."
     So the Chads were left hanging and pregnant and dimpled.
     And the stress of it all put George Bush among the pimpled!

     Then the Grinch raised a finger for the night's final push.
     "Election Day's done, and the winner is BUSH."
     After all, George was leading at least by a dozen.
     (And whenever it's close, always go with your cousin.)
     "Play the music, the songs, pop the corks, sing the praises,
     "'Cause with Bush as the winner, you're all getting raises!"
     And then the Grinch yawned, "This election stuff's hokey,
     Good-bye 'till next year! And now back to you, Cokie."

     And the Grinch, he went back to his old Grinchy pad.
     But en route, he was nabbed by a little Chad lad
     Who had stayed up all night (quite ignoring his dad).
     He stared at the Grinch and said, "Sir, who's our leader?
     "Is it Bush? Is it Gore? Or, my choice, Derek Jeter?"
     And the Grinch simply smiled: This day couldn't be sweeter.

     They were finding out now that no outcome was coming!
     They were seeing it now, all their dumbness and dumbing.
     "They're just waking up!" he said. "Here's what they'll do!
     "Their mouths will hang open a minute or two
     "And the Chads down in Chad-ville will all cry, 'WE'LL SUE!' "

     As he stared down at Chad-ville, the Grinch popped his eyes,
     But the scene that he saw brought a shocking surprise.
     All the Chads down in Chad-ville, Chad lads and Chad dads,
     They were counting the votes, they were counting the chads!
     He hadn't stopped an outcome from coming.
     IT CAME!
     SOMEHOW OR ANOTHER, IT CAME JUST THE SAME!

     As the Grinch with his head buried deep in the sand
     Sat puzzling and puzzling, "They will count them by hand?"
     Yes, it came with the lawsuits, it came with the lawyers,
     It came with Tim Russert, it came with Bill Moyers.
     When the ballots were plucked and the counting was done
     The last margin of victory turned out to be ... ONE!
     And if the Grinch had just voted,
     ... HIS GUY WOULD HAVE WON!
     And what happened then ...
     Well ...
     In Chad-ville they say

     That the Grinch's small district
     Grew three sizes that day.

     'Cause the minute his mood had come out of its slump,
     The Grinch said, "Hmm! I could be running this dump!"
     So he formed a committee to do all the work
     And he ...
     HE HIMSELF!
     The Grinch ran for town clerk!

     'Twas A Week Past Election

     'Twas a week past election and all through the land,
     Not a president was chosen and no decision at hand.

     The ballots were counted again and again
     In hopes that Florida, the Vice President would win.

     The governor had won it, or so he had said
     And thoughts of his cabinet danced in his head.

     While Gore and his lawyers and Bush and his too
     Argued and argued about what to do.

     When down in Palm Beach arose such confusion,
     As thousands of Jews voted Buchanan!

     The box for Buchanan was too close to Gore's,
     So Bush got the most votes. Should Gore have had more?

     Then what in the nation's eyes did appear?
     But thousands of lawyers and lawsuits to hear.

     Faster and faster the lawyers they came,
     With a truckload of briefs, and people to blame.

     And then the Vice President said, and I quote:
     "We must hand count each Floridian's vote."

     The country then watched as Florida reported
     Numbers and figures the media distorted.

     The Vice President was weak, his chances were thin,
     That in the end, the Presidency he'd win.

     The governor's aides confidently touted
     "We've won the election. Votes don't need to be counted."

     No one cared anymore who was elected,
     As long as it ended and one was selected.

     As they polled Palm Beach County and counted again,
     FIDONEWS 17-49               Page 16                  27 Nov 2000


     America knew it never would end.

     Thousands protested the votes that were tossed,
     No one would ever concede he had lost.

     And the media debated into the night,
     Whether the holes should have been on the right.

     And so no one knew from the west to the east,
     Who got the most votes or who got the least.

     But the voice of reason calmed everyone's fears:
     We'll do this again in another four years.

     DS> kind of official document so they have no need to swear allegience

     Did P4 exist when you joined?  Most likely.  Did you freely accept a
     node number?  Yes.  Then whether you like it or not or want to admit
     it or not, you accepted P4.  That's when you voted 'yes'.  You could
     have voted 'no' and declined the node number.

     There's a speed limit on the road that runs in front of your house.
     Did you vote for it?  No.  Does it apply to you?  Yes.  Do you have a
     choice?  Of course:  Accept it, move away, ignore it and accept any
     repercussions, or get it changed.

     The last is the most important aspect.  If you want to change it, you
     can, but you have to change the system from within the system.  That's
     the hard part.

     I don't think anyone feels that P4 is perfect.  Far from it, I'd say.
     I further don't think that anyone can dig up a stone tablet with a
     vote count chisled in it.  As I recall it was a marginally more
     palateable alternative to having the IFNA ram itself down our throats.

     DS> As regards this Z1C election, P4 is also quite irrelevant, which
     is one of the reasons why if the election does not come about by
     direct sysop-vote of *their* choice for Z1C, and not the RCs, the
     election is also invalid.

     No, I'm sorry.  Not so.  It almost directly compares to the Electoral
     College in the way it carries the vote.  Can the Electoral College
     Delegate cast the vote any way he wants to?  Sure.  Would it be
     foolish to do so?  You betcha. Same holds true for the RCC vote for
     Z1C.  An RC would sign his own impeachment papers by abusing the vote
     he carries.

     Baloney. Carol has a right to her opinion just as you do. And yes her
     vote along with the other votes in her region counts. That in no way
     violates her pledge to vote her region's majority for a candidate.

     You cannot disenfranchize her rights because she is voluntarily doing
     a service for us all. It is NOT time for her to go.  She has done an
     excellent job considering the mind sets of the folks she has to deal
     with to get the job done.

     Why not give a little credit to those who are trying to work with a
     f'd-up antiquated Policy, which they have no options to do otherwise
     until it is modified, ratified and in place.

     You HAVE to plow with the only horse you have, until your returns are
     sufficient to buy another horse.  P4 cannot be ignored as some would
     have you believe. It can be rescinded, replaced, or modified, but not
     ignored if the Fido structure is to hold true.

     Hi Phil.
     Phil Simpson replied in a message to Ruth Argust:

     RA> If 6 RCs voted for sysop-level elections, i.e. revised what is
     known as version A, it would have passed. I do not know how or
     where the RCs keep coming up with this thought that to have
     sysop-level elections, they needed 100% to approve of it.

     PS> Pretty obvious, they make things up as they go along. How else
     would they keep their covetted power.

     I am reminded of a famous movie, the Wizard of Oz, in which some of
     the RCs seem to be playing a part. We have Dorothy wandering about a
     bit aimlessly on her way following the yellow brick road that
     disappears and becomes confusing to her. On her heels is her yapping
     little, faithful dog, Toto. They meet the scarecrow (strawman) who
     lacks a brain, the lion who lacks courage and the tin man who lacks a
     heart. Together they search for the all powerful Wizard of Oz to grant
     their wishes. Then they find he has no power at all; he is simply a
     charleton.

     What's even more amazing about this comparison is that one can see
     which RCs have assumed which characters with just a little thought :)

                              FIDONET HISTORY
     =================================================================

                             by Bob Seaborn
                            *second update*

             This goes back to the late-early days of Fidonet (about 10
     years ago).  The major distribution was set up and functioning, and a
     couple of talented programmers came along from Holland. One, Harald
     Harms, wrote and developed ALLFIX, a quality file-tosser, that is
     still extensively used today.  A second, Gerard van der Land, wrote
     Gecho, an extremely powerful echomail tosser, which while not being
     continued today, influenced the development of similar programs. There
     were a fair number of others also, but the intent here is not to
     discuss the programs, read on.


             With these developments came a Fidonet sysop, one Jim Smoot,
     at the time living in Texas, having retired from the US military, who
     worked with these programmers, and others, to market the fruits of
     their labor under what became known as the RegSite Team, at one time
     having members world-wide.  Jim also actively developed a series of
     beta teams to work with the programmers and debug the developing
     programs, as well as test new features.  During this time, Jim also
     represented other programs, including InterMail/InterEcho, Telemate,
     and many others. The RegSite Team and beta teams are still functioning
     today.


             About 3 years ago, Jim's health dramatically failed, he was
     diagnosed with severe emphysema, resulting in very low lung function.
     This was primarily caused by his military activities, coupled with
     years of smoking.  He also moved from Texas to Tennessee, to be closer
     to his immediate family (and the NASCAR tracks).  After various up's
     and down's, he was placed on the waiting list for a lung transplant.
     Well the time finally arrived, last evening (November 13, 2000) I
     received the following email from him:


     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     Date: Tue, 13 Nov 2000 08:08:14
     From: Jim & Nancy Smoot
     Subject: The time is upon us .....


             Only have a few minutes, but the Transplant Coordinator at
     H.H. McQuire Hospital in Richmond, VA called and they have a left lung
     for me. Ergo, they are sending a Jet Air Ambulance to Springfield for
     to pick me and Miz Nancy up and fly us to Richmond where they are
     going to replace my left lung tonight.  They haven't even taken the
     lung out of the other person yet.....keeping him/her on a life support
     system until they can get me there.  Beyond that, I have NO clue if
     its a guy or a girl's lung, not any of the circumstances involved with
     the person, nor how old or young (s)he is.

             I have a GREAT team of Pulmo Doctors up there, and their after
     surgery care is out of this world ..... really good.  But, there is
     ALWAYS that element of chance in a procedure such as this ..... I just
     hope they are all sober tonight and feeling good.  :)

             Gotta run; will keep everyone posted on what's what and how
     everything is going on with me.  Miz Nancy is already in a dither,
     running around here like a chicken with her head cut off ..... but she
     DOES have a method to her madness, I guarantee. I can already see some
     of her "doings" starting to fall into place.  :)

             That's it ..... gotta scoot.  C U later, gang.

      All The Best,

       --- J. Smoot
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

             I did have a chance to briefly talk with Jim prior to his
     leaving Springfield, and while he sounded somewhat worried, he was in
     excellent spirits, joking about his flight north.  I wished him the
     best.  At the time, he asked me to let his many Fido friends and
     acquaintances know what was happening with him.  What follows is
     easiest if we use a diary format.


     Tuesday, November 14, 2000

             It was obviously a long sleepless night for Jim's family and
     close friends, and early this morning I received a phone call from
     Lisa, his youngest daughter, who reported that as of 7:45 EST, Jim was
     still in the operating room, with the doctors very optimistic as to
     the prognosis. She sounded very worried and upset, albeit somewhat
     calm.  Reported that she was in better shape than Nancy, her mother.

              Then about 12:15 EST Lisa called again to report that Jim was
     out of the operating room, and in recovery, and all is good.  He will
     be kept there for a couple of hours, then woken up and moved to the
     Intensive Care Unit for a couple of days, during which time he will be
     asked to walk around to get the lung functional.  After that, they
     will be monitoring him for signs of rejection.  Lisa sounded very
     relieved, and reported that Nancy (her mother) was in high spirits.  I
     gathered that the plans were to keep him there for a few weeks.

             It's now just before 9pm EST, and Lisa just gave me the report
     that the doctors removed Jim's breathing tube, and he's doing very
     well breathing on his own.  Looks like there'll be a good night's
     sleep for Jim's family and friends


     Wednesday, November 15, 2000

             It's now morning, and Jim is doing well.  The doctors and
     therapists have had him up and walking around already to get the new
     lung active.  Later in the day, he found time to have a quick phone
     conversation with his close family, and sounded very good.
     FIDONEWS 17-49               Page 22                  27 Nov 2000


     Thursday, November 16, 2000

             Morning, and Jim is continuing to do well, and had another
     brief voice call with the part of his immediate family that remained
     in Tennessee.  Other than being slightly groggy from painkillers and
     other drugs, he's doing extremely well.



     Friday, November 17, 2000

             Another morning, and Jim is all over the place, just itching
     to get out of there and head home.  Sounds like the Jim I know,
     probably itching to be at some NASCAR event.


     End of the first week


             Tuesday Jim was moved from Intensive Care to his own private
     room, and they also took him off oxygen the same day, a few coughing
     spells and he's breathing well on his own.  I had a chance to actually
     chat voice with him for about 15 minutes, and he sounded as good as I
     ever recall him, no breathing problems whatsoever, minimal pain as the
     incisions heal. Probably a few cracked ribs as well, and the can be
     quite painful while healing.  He expects to be heading home in a week
     or two.

             If anyone is interested in sending Jim messages, please do so
     via email to "smoot@nwstar.com", he will receive the mail when he
     returns to Tennessee, however please don't expect any prompt response
     as he'll be doing so at his convenience.

     If you yelled for 8 years, 7 months, and 6 days, you would have
     produced enough sound energy to heat up one cup of coffee. (Hardly
     seems worth it.)

     If you fart consistently for 6 years and 9 months, enough gas is
     produced to create the energy of an atomic bomb. (Now, that's more
     like it.)

     The human heart creates enough pressure when it pumps out of the body
     to squirt blood 30 feet.

     A pig's orgasm lasts for 30 minutes. (In my next life I want to be a
     pig.)

     Banging your head against a wall uses 150 calories an hour. (Still not
     over that pig thing.)

     Humans and dolphins are the only species that have sex for pleasure.
     (Is that why Flipper is always smiling)?

     And why isn't the pig included in this list?

     On average, people fear spiders more then they do death.

     A crocodile cannot stick out its tongue.

     The ant can lift 50 times its own weight, can pull 30 times its own
     weight, and always falls over on its right side when intoxicated.
     (From drinking little bottles of....? Did the gov't pay for this
     research?)

     Polar bears are left handed. (Who knew? Who cares? Did the gov't pay
     for this too?)

     The flea can jump 350 times its body length. It's like a human jumping
     the length of a football field.

     A cockroach will live 9 days without its head before it starves to
     death. (That is a pleasant thought!)

     The male praying mantis cannot copulate while it's head is attached to
     its body. The female initiates sex by ripping the male's head off.
     (Hi, honey. I'm home. What the...?)

     Some lions mate over 50 times a day. (In my next life I still want to
     be a pig. Quality over quantity, you know.)

     Butterflies taste with their feet. (Oh, jeez!)

     Elephants are the only animals that can't jump. ( if they did you'd
     think it was an earthquake)

     An ostrich's eye is bigger than its brain.  (I know some people like
     that.)

     Starfish don't have brains. (I know some people like this too.)

     Remember, when someone annoys you, it takes 42 muscles in your face to
     frown. BUT, it only takes 4 muscles to extend your arm and smack'em
     upside the head.

     Re: Z!C Election rules
     St:
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
                         ZONE 1 COORDINATOR ELECTION - 2000

     The Z1C has announced an election, for a new Z1C. Per Policy4, the ZC
     is elected by the RC's under them.  It is the choice of the RC's to do
     this by the following method per P4 section 6.2.

     A Z1 Sysop is defined as any Sysop who is nodelisted in Z1 and
     physically located within the normal geographical boundries of zone 1.

     The nodelist used will be the nodelist.322 version.  Reasonable
     exceptions will be made during the nomination phase by the election
     coordinator if a node, net or region is accidently dropped from this
     version and this is validated by the RC or NC of the affected node.
     The term 'nodelisted' means listed in this version of the nodelist.

                                 Nominations

                Nominating time table: NOV 17-25, 2000
                All dates start at 00:00 and end at 11:59 PM EST

     Any nodelisted Z1 Sysop of Fidonet may nominate themselves or another
     nodelisted Sysop of of Z1 Fidonet for the position of Z1C.  The
     nomination must be made in the Z1_Election echo and should be
     addressed to the Election Coordinator.

     The nomination must include the name of the nominee and their Fidonet
     node number.

     FIDONEWS 17-49               Page 28                  27 Nov 2000


     Once a nomination has been received by the election coordinator, the
     name will be added to the list of nominees.  The nomination must then
     be accepted by the nominee and seconded by a Z1 Sysop in the echo to
     become a fully eligible candidate.

                Discussion Period NOV 26- DEC 02, 2000
                All dates start at 00:00 and end at 11:59 PM EST

     Following the nomination period, a period shall be allowed for each
     candidate to campaign for the position.  During this period,
     questioning of the candidates is encouraged.

                Regional Feedback Period  DEC 03-16, 2000
                All dates start at 00:00 and end at 11:59 PM EST

     Following the campaign period, the above period shall be allowed for
     each region to conduct selection proceedings in accordance with
     regional policy and such methods as are determined as appropriate
     based on regional policy or the desires of the Sysops within that
     region.  All voting or other feedback including what is desired if
     there is a run-off election and the primary candidate your region
     selected is eliminated, must be concluded no later than 16 DEC.  No
     time is alloted to conduct secondary polls of regional input once RC
     voting commences.

                Regional Coordinator Voting - DEC 17-22, 2000
                All dates start at 00:00 and end at 11:59 PM EST

     Following collection of regional input, the RC's shall cast their
     vote. (Location TBD at this time).

     Initial voting will be from 17-18 DEC.  The candidate with the most
     votes, wins.  This will be calculated by a simple majority where if
     any one candidate receives 6 RC votes, they will be announced as the
     winner.  If no candidate achieves 6 RC votes, a run-off election will
     take place from 19-20 DEC between the top 2 candidates.

     Contesting of the vote will take place from 21-22 DEC.  Once finalized
     and with no RC's contesting the vote, the results will be posted in
     the Z1_ELECTION echo.

     Note, this section may be ammended after the initial Z1C election
     process has begun, in order to finalize the location of the RC votes.

                Term begin/end: Turnover date to May 2003

     Upon completion of the election, the newly elected Z1C's term begins
     as soon as turnover can be accomplished but no later than 5 January
     2001. Due to early turnover, the normal 2 year period will be extended
     5 months and end May 2003.  This is in order to avoid mandating a vote
     over the holiday season in 2 years.

     a @ preceding an individual's name implies a virtual email

     firstlast@osirusoft.com will automatically route to the

     also receive routed notice of this feature.  In my case, it
     would still be joejared@osirusoft.com, but you get the idea.

     Also, as information is provided to me, I will be adding a
     latency field to each node, which is defined as the maximum
     time between when the message is received, and when it is
     sent on to other nodes, or available to be sent onward,
     defined in minutes. A latency of ! implies that there is an
     immediate response, and an attempt to deliver immediately
