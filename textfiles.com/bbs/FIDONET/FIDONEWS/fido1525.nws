                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================


     It's interesting to see how questions asked are not answered.

     In my own case, there are many questions asked of me for which I
     sometimes have no answer for...and the refusal to respond is taken
     as 'hiding something'.

     What's forgotten is that _asking_ questions is the means by which one
     can _gain_ knowledge.  By the same token, what is often forgotten is
     that getting an answer is sometimes a courtesy, as much as it is
     sometimes a requirement.

     Too often, especially in FidoNet, the mere act of asking questions is
     tantamount to making an accusation...perhaps, it seems, because the
     person being asked does often not _want_ those same questions asked
     of them.

     Too true, I too have been accused of these same things...but also
     true is that I have had 'real world' experience as both a print and
     broadcast journalist.

     Sometimes, failing to answer a question is simply a matter of not
     wishing to interfere in the process of gathering information, much
     as the local police do not always answer questions about ongoing
     investigations as to motive or even the names of the victims.

     Sometimes, however, failing to answer a question is a means of hiding
     from the truth of the matter...especially in political situations.

     One only has to look at the media in Zone 1 for the ongoing Clinton
     debacle as one example; no doubt, you've seen your own local version
     at some point in time.

     Too often, the same questions are used to enable an effort to create
     and manipulate a 'lynch mob' mentality...and allow the 'court of
     public opinion' to rule by emotion and innuendo, rather than logic
     and reason.

     To date, I have now had three RECs advise me that Ben Hamilton was
     'duly appointed' to post the results of the RECC vote...

     But no one has yet answered the question of whether or not the ZEC
     was advised of the charges, let alone given the chance to respond to
     them.

     How interesting that this particular question has not only been not
     answered, but that any explanation of the charges or the particulars,
     as well as the causes, examples and reasons, have been declared as
     being "secret", and not for you or I to know.

     How interesting that the RECC would use the FidoNews to make an
     'official announcement'...then refuse to give the basis for that vote
     FIDONEWS 15-25               Page 2                   22 Jun 1998


     being taken, let alone be announced.

     How pathetic that the FidoNews is sought for use to encourage a 'star
     chamber' courtroom, where secret trials are conducted without the
     knowledge of the accused, as a means to give a sort of "validation"
     of the effort.

     How much worse it is that the first person elected by a SysOp-level
     election in Zone 1 is to be removed by a 'secret vote' with 'secret
     charges' of 'secret crimes' that those who elected the ZEC cannot be
     told what these 'secrets' entail...let alone tell the ZEC who is
     the 'secret criminal' in their 'secret trial'.

     To that end, I suppose we must thank Ben Hamilton...without his post,
     at the direction of the RECC, would we have even _known_ that such a
     trial was underway?

     Or should we be thankful for the small favors that our "elected"
     officials deign to grant us mere peasants in their "fight" for an
     'open and informed' FidoNet?

     Does anyone else notice the oddity of logic in the actions of the
     RECC?  Especially since several of the RECC themselves have made it a
     point to identify themselves as 'elected' officials within FidoNet?

     But then, these are _questions_...and we've seen what these 'mean'
     in terms of FidoNet...

     And, in my own situation?  The answers are forthcoming.

     In other news...

     Bob Kohl was retained as Region 10 Coordinator, by an almost 2:1
     margin vote.  Not that this is expected to stop what sniping and
     accusations that have already occurred, nor the comments about
     'wearing multiple hats in violation of Policy'.

     [An interesting note:  If 'wearing multiple hats' is a violation of
     Policy, then why is the ZC also an IC, as a matter of course?  Hmm?
     Doesn't the ZC have as much to do administratively as the IC?]

     And, Thom LaCosta is currently testing a new EchoList software that
     he is modifying to use in FidoNet Zone 1.  Moderators are suggested
     to link in and establish a new set of passwords, separate from any
     already in place.

     However, there are some concerns over the issue of the Zone 2 ELIST
     containing different moderators than the same echoes listed in the
     Zone 1 ELIST...and that the apparent NAB spokesman is pushing to have
     the Z2ELIST be adopted instead as 'official' in Zone 1.

     I can't think of a neater way to eliminate opposition than to take
     their echoes from them, can you?

     Consider this yet another reason why the ELIST should be independent
     of the various distribution services is to eliminate the 'political
     FIDONEWS 15-25               Page 3                   22 Jun 1998


     usefulness' of the echoes as leverage.

     =================================================================


     RESPONSE TO EDITORIAL IN FIDONEWS DATED 15 JUNE 1998
     By Ben Hamilton, FidoNet 1:124/7008

     This letter is in response to the editorial that was included in the
     FidoNews issue on June 15, 1998.

     I have been accused of selective quoting.  The editor encourages you
     to re-read the editorials, making sure you compare the meanings of
     what the editor wrote to the selective quoting done in the reply.

     Perhaps the editor should also re-read my reply from last week, in
     which I plainly state why selective quoting was necessary:

      BH> The editorial contained several inaccuracies that I would like
      BH> to talk about.  Hopefully, the personal knowledge I have of some
      BH> of the issues will be of more value than the best guesses of the
      BH> editor.

     To elaborate, since I have personal knowledge of only some of the
     comments made by the editor, it is only proper that I respond to
     only those comments.  The items that I selected were the ones to
     which I have personal knowledge.  The editor is free to state
     whatever views he likes on the other issues, regardless of accuracy,
     as far as I am concerned, as I have no way to counter information
     that I myself have not witnessed and verified.

     There was, unfortunately, an inaccuracy in my reply from last week.
     Rather than make you guess, as the editor seems to have chosen to do,
     I would like to take this opportunity to highlight it.  Here is an
     excerpt from last week's reply which contains my error:

      ed> the RECC holding secret meetings and refusing to discuss matters
      ed> with the ZEC, and other similarly puerile activities, make it
      ed> odd that Ben and the RECC would not include their 'list of
      ed> grievances' that they claim would prove their position...in a
      ed> public setting.

      [...]

      BH> Also, we never refused to discuss this with the ZC.  I think we
      BH> each welcome discussing this with Bob Satti at any time.

     My error was simply that I misread "ZEC" for "ZC" in the editor's
     editorial.  My mistake.

     What I said about discussing it with the ZC is true.  Kohl, on the
     other hand, completely disappeared from our view as of late.  Perhaps
     he's been too busy removing NCs and NECs, changing nodelist flags,
     etc.  I do specifically remember a discussion between the RECs...
     Several RECs wanted to vote almost immediately after Kohl asked us
     how we would go about removing an NEC.  Some of the other perhaps
     FIDONEWS 15-25               Page 5                   22 Jun 1998


     more patient, level-headed RECs suggested that we show an extra
     effort to try to work our differences out rather than giving up so
     quickly.  After that, Kohl removed the NEC on his own, then he
     removed an NC, his REC quit because of his actions, and the
     disclosure of in-transit netmail issue happened (which he has
     recently apologized for, I hear).  Then, we learn of a new R10C
     election (no doubt a chief reason he apologized, I believe) that due
     to its timing and the fact that only NCs (the NCs that Kohl hasn't
     removed from office, of course!) can vote in, has (pardon me, ed)
     "suspicious" written all over it.  If this were happening in R19,
     I bet the editor would be having a field day!  But it's in R10, so
     it's "politics as usual."

     Region 10 matters shouldn't concern those outside of Region 10.  They
     do, however, allow us to see what can happen when FidoNet as a whole
     lets someone get away with ignoring the "multiple hats" guideline.

     Again, I speak only for myself.  The views expressed in this letter to
     the editors do not necessarily reflect the views of any other RECC
     members.  I will be back if I notice any other interesting things to
     comment about.  As I write this, it's Saturday morning, so I hope you
     all have a great Father's Day!

     MooseChat Canadian humor/satire echo "backboned"
     by Stephen Hart, 1:249/127
     hart@io.com

     Greetings!  I am writing this "short" article to let y'all know that
     the MOOSECHAT Moose and Hoser "Canadian Humor" Chat echo has recently
     moved from being a Canadian regional echo to being available on the
     various FidoNet echomail backbones and 'spines.

     Having accomplished the main purpose of this article, I could then
     have taken a couple different routes.  Rather than attempt some of
     the humour and satire to be found in the message area, I'm just going
     to give a "quick" description of what MooseChat is like...

     MooseChat is an echo for anyone who wants to attempt witty, humorous,
     or just plain silly messages.  Many distinguished moose, Hosers from
     the Great White North, and even famous Performance Artists like
     Saddam Hussein and George Bush have all frequented MooseChat at one
     time or another.  A moose-like angle, alias, or shtick is appreciated
     but not necessary.  Moose sometimes stray into serious topics and
     satire is often seen, but those attempting serious discussion may
     need to survive receiving silly replies.

     The MooseChat "echo theme" is to disseminate knowledge about the
     noble moose, to discuss attributes of moose we have known and
     admired, and to generally enter messages which are a bit more silly
     or offbeat than one finds in most other echoes.

     Lest you think that unique Canadian content is not a significant part
     of MooseChat, I'll mention that participants will happily discuss
     topics like "Cheese as a significant part of Canadian Culture<tm>,"
     "the letter U's importance to both our French and English heritage,"
     plus "Doughnuts and the Canadian Identity."  I also assure you that
     though Canadian politics may not always provide as "target rich" an
     environment as some other countries, we do have our moments.  As a
     Canadian patriot, I just had to mention that last bit, eh?

     In closing, I'll mention that MooseChat may not be for everyone
     because appreciation of both humour and satire is very subjective.
     Still, while there are other "silly chat" echoes, MooseChat does
     seem to have a unique flavour.  I hope some of you will find it an
     amusing or witty place to hang out.

     As for this FidoNews article;  Perhaps it's ironic, but all I can say
     is...    "Dammit Shatner!  I'm an echo moderator, not a comedian."

     The following philosophy is based on several years of experience by
     both authors. The article speaks for itself, but we think those who
     will protest most loudly against it are probably those about whom it
     was written.

     Solution-oriented or Problem-oriented?
     ======================================
     by Bill Drake (1:153/151) and Dallas Hinton (1:153/715)

     In FidoNet, as in real life, there are two ways to deal with problems.
     We can focus on the problems, or we can focus on the solutions.

     In the past, most FidoNet members have focused on solutions. Lately,
     many FidoNet members have been focusing on problems, thus wasting time
     and effort. We believe it's time for FidoNet to return to a
     solution-oriented focus.

     Recently, a vocal group of grumblers has endlessly objected to any
     attempts at modernizing or improving the effectiveness of FidoNet's
     administration, and has endlessly objected to any changes in FidoNet's
     technical standards.

     Some people in this world are "conflict junkies". These people don't
     want solutions, because solutions destroy their opportunities for
     fighting and stirring up trouble.

     Real solutions involve compromise, understanding, and fair play -- not
     rhetoric, intolerance, or ignoring the rules when they happen to be
     personally inconvenient.

     It's time for clearer heads in FidoNet to prevail, before there's
     nothing left of FidoNet but useless scrap. The conflict junkies must
     not be allowed to win by default.

     We will continue ignoring the attempts of conflict junkies to destroy
     our hobby, and continue working happily with those who truly want
     solutions. We think it's better to bring FidoNet into the 21st Century
     than fight endlessly and end up mourning over FidoNet's grave.

     Won't you join us, please?

     Dear Editorbeing,

     This article is submitted by Doc Logger (163/110) who
     battled vicious tides and enveloping fog to get to a phone
     connection. Unfortunately, the phone was inconveniently
     located in an abandoned fish processing plant so if this
     missive smells a bit fishy, my apologies.

     Roll da flic, Zorch....

     Dear Reverend Visage,

     Thank god the GPS navstar unit works and I was able to find
     my way back to shore after spending the day fishing for
     alleged squid. The boat operator took us out of sight of
     land and then suggested that we drop our lines and hope for
     the best. I haven't been so entertained since the last time
     I watched the golf channel on TV. I think fishing must
     require a great deal more rum than we had aboard because
     even though I tried to attract whole hordes of squid with my
     lunch and breakfast, nary a one took the bait. Naturally,
     the fog rolled in before we'd been out for an hour and it
     took the rest of the day to find the port.

     Speaking of large quantities of fog, Visage, you'll be
     pleased to know that there is an election in Region 10. Bob
     "Dimbulb" Satti claimed that he had no control over the
     shotgun timing of the election, even though Bob Kohl was
     given a one week running start on any other candidate. One
     of Kohl's trained seals, Mike Moon, has announced that he's
     gonna vote for Kohl because he's pissed at the outside
     interest in the region. This genius in one of Kohl's
     appointees so it is hardly fair to expect independent
     thought or reasonable judgment out of the guy.

     I suspect that if Kohl wins the election, it will mean the
     exit of a number of sysops who have reached their level of
     tolerance with the idiocy of Satti and the malign
     administration of Kohl. I sent a number of queries to the
     co-returning officer of the election, Brenda Donovan, but
     she didn't deign to respond. I particularly wanted her to
     indicate whether she endorsed the ludicrous timing of the
     election since it occurred to me that Satti's lunacy would
     be somewhat curtailed if it wasn't so easy for him to find
     naive quislings.

     On a brighter note, Kohl dodged the silver bullet on the
     policy complaints that were contemplated and pending. It
     seems that Satti rejected the PC of Hans Mangold who had
     complained when Kohl revealed the content of in-transit
     FIDONEWS 15-25               Page 9                   22 Jun 1998


     netmail. Kohl ducked a PC by Lesley-Dee Dylan by offering up
     a last minute apology for his despicable behaviour.

     I have a feeling that Alec Grynspan will be green with envy
     when he discovers that I was given a quantum leap into new
     technology. The good sysops of Net163, and particularly

                                               zone 2, net 206, June 16
     Dear fellow fidonuts,

     Some people say, I note when I read my FidoNews, that politics this
     or politics that is what is scaring people away from our net, or
     what will keep them.  I hold another opinion, as I think many
     others do too.

     Politics or playing them is not what makes the net fun (well, not
     for more than a minority, anyway), but it may well be what keeps it
     working.  Even though politics and even net politics can seem to be
     on the brink of collapsing the entire system, it often seems almost
     designed to survive a whole lot of banging.  People may argue with
     each other, and do things they should not, but it will not break down
     the net.

     Instead, what we find netters afraid of, is that the net itself will
     die out, and I hear that this evolution is much worse over in zone
     1.  People seldom leave because of politics (it does happen, though,
     and it makes me sad every time), they leave because they no longer
     find the net as much fun as it used to be.  This can be because
     something else is more fun, or because the net itself is becoming
     less fun.

     Now, read me right, I do not mean that everyone should tell a joke
     every now and then, because the opinion of what fun _is_ can vary
     greatly.  What I do mean is that some people go around sulking so
     much that they forget to get themselves into discussions they find
     interesting.

     Over here there are a few projects on the move to get more points
     into the net, but none to keep the nodes we have.  What we need is
     an overall better attitude towards .. well .. the fall.  We may lose
     a few, and it gets us down, but if we keep a smile on our faces, and
     keep on writing those flames and flowers and questions into the echo
     areas, the net will go on.

     And if someone ever asks you "Where could I go to find interesting
     discussions", never hesitate to give them the appropriate software;
     instead do what many Swedish fidousers would have done -- give them
     a disk and the information they need to get an uplink.

     I hear there are even easier ways to get on to fido nowadays.
     Strange inventions over there in the first zone -- spam-safe gateways
     into news and into mailinglists and other such things.  I am
     impressed.

     As long as the spirit lives on, fidonet will not die, and even in
     the worst case scenario, we will be here for many years yet.  You
     knew that, but perhaps it is good to hear, sometimes?

     So our nodelists are dwindling, but what about our pointlists?
     Are not yours just a little on the rise, like ours?

     With fewer nodes and more points, distribution gets tricky.  _That_
     is where we'll need those politics.  Not in what politicians usually
     do: hassling each other over nothings.  This is not big, but it is
     something we all should be personally interested in, being hobby
     networkers, doing what we consider to be a hobby.


     (..and scr*w commercial interests..)


     Sincerely,

       Per Edman <2:206/145.42>
