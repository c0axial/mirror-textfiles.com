     Not much new going on. Zone 4 DID get a new ZC. I saw it in the
     Nodediff on Friday but nobody bothered to let FidoNews know so it
     could be passed on the easy way. Maybe neither the past or the new
     ZC4 ever heard of FidoNews?

     So, I'll tell you that ZC4 is now:

       Alejandro Alvarez at 4:900/309 in or around Buenos Aires in
       Argentina.

     From his listings, it appears he also an RC and an NC which is a lot
     of hats if you have more than 20 Nodes in your Region or Net but that
     is just speculation since no official notice has been forthcoming.

     One can only hope this ZC4 will be more responsive than the last ZC4.
     Congratulations [or commiserations as appropriate], Alejandro! Feel
     free to use FidoNews to tell us everything. [grin]

     And on a completely irrelevant note, are the FLorida Marlins going to
     the World Series against the Cleveland Indians? [remember, you heard
     it here first.] [grin]

     For those who participate in the semi-annual stupidity, it's only TWO
     weeks until Daylight Savings Time ends and normal time resumes. Mark
     your calendars!

     For those of you with FidoNet-related websites or webpages, be sure to

     Hello Chris.

     Feel free to print.  :-)

     ===

     Hi all.

     This bug seems to show up every so often.  So here's a reminder...

     A MSGID without the system ID field is illegal.  PCBoard is notorious
     for doing this!  It is a bug which they have been aware of for years
     but have failed to fix.  Here is a note from a PCB SysOp who found out
     how to force it to work.

     ===

      J> Your system is generating MSGIDs which are not legal.  They
      J> contain a MSGID value (32 bit hex number) but no system of origin
      J> info.

      D> Got to digging into the configuration, and found a place to set
      D> the 'Default AKA Conference Range'.  Since I only have one
      D> address, I figured 'who needs that, there's only one 'AKA' to
      D> chose, it must be the default?'  Turns out I did, I plugged my
      D> node number in there and now the MSGID is right.

     Adrian,

       I have noticed with dismay that despite being updated several times
     lately, REAL_FREE_SPEECH is in the expiring list!  Why is that?  I
     have also noted that CABLE_MODEMS, despite jumping through all the
     appropriate hoops, and being requested by 3 REC's is still not listed!
     Can you explain this?

     Also, I tried to Elist several expired listings lately.  All of my
     requests failed, but I note with great interest that others (many of
     them not the former moderators of record) have been able to e-list
     them.  When I asked you about this, all you told me was to read BOFAQ,
     which basically said wait until after the listing expires.  Why do my
     requests to E-list things bounce, but others do not?  Enquiring minds
     want to know...

     Chris:  Please publish this so that others in FidoNet will know to
     check their echo's listings, to ensure they are not having similar
     trouble.

     What would you like me to explain?  What I've seen (0 traffic for
     instance, and no indication that it was there before today) has led me

     to beleave that it was being held somehow.  If I am in error, I am
     sorry.  I know you don't beleave that, but there it is, none the less.

     After your last netmail to me, I figgured you just had it in for me
     like your buddy Bodger.

     > Check BACKBONE.NA.

     Funny you should mention that.  I still haven't seen it.  I'll look
     around on the net for another copy, and see if I have a local problem.
     I'm sorry for any inconvienance.

     I'm not trying to be obtuse, but this made no sence to me.  If an echo
     has gone 6 months without being listed, it's fair game right?

     Hmmm.  Okay, why not code that function?  I'm new to C programming,
     but if I could be of any help, I'd be happy to be.  I'm looking for
     something to work on right now anyway, to sharpen my skills.

     You know, if you just said these things in the first place, there'd be
     a lot less confusion.

     > You'll always know when passwords have been purged because you will

     What am I misreading then?  It seemed to me that all the echo's I
     wanted HAD been de-listed already.

     Chris - please post this WITH my other one.

                     NOTICE OF FTSC ADMINISTRATOR NOMINATIONS
                     ========================================

     by Adrian Walker, 1:153/752
     06 October 1997

                                    ==========
                                    BACKGROUND
                                    ==========

     From 01 December 1996 until 24 March 1997, discussion in the
     FTSC_PUBLIC echo defined the mission and operating procedures for a
     revitalized Fidonet Technical Standards Committee (FTSC), ending in
     the publication of two new documents, FTA-1000 (FTSC Charter) and
     FTA-1001 (FTSC Operations).

     From 24 March until 01 August 1997, nominations were accepted for FTSC
     Standing Members from RCs and RECs throughout Fidonet.  From 16 August
     until 05 September 1997, the RCs and RECs voted, and 24 Standing
     Members were elected.

     Since then, the Standing Members have been linked to the FTSC echo,
     and Working Groups are being set up to address revision of the
     existing Fidonet Technical Standards.

     The final step is to elect the FTSC Administrator, at which point the
     FTSC becomes fully operational.  The duties of the administrator are
     published in FTA-1001.

                                    ===========
                                    NOMINATIONS
                                    ===========

     The following extract from FTA-1001 describes the nomination and
     voting process:

          The FTSC administrator is appointed for a four year renewable
          term.

          To be eligible for appointment, an individual must be a Fidonet
          node, be actively involved in Fidonet, though not necessarily in
          a programming context, and should have proven organizational
          skills. A candidate need not be a member of the FTSC.  It is
          recommended that a successful candidate not carry any *C or *EC
          responsibilities during the term of office.

          A candidate for FTSC Administrator may be nominated by any
          Standing Member.

     FIDONEWS 14-41               Page 6                   13 Oct 1997


          The FTSC Administrator is appointed on the basis of a vote by all
          Standing Members who are defined by the then-current edition of
          FTA-0003 (FTSC Membership List).  A successful candidate must
          receive approval by at least a plurality of votes.

          Publication of the nominations and the voting procedure shall
          take place openly in the FTSC_PUBLIC echo, and voting shall close
          three weeks after publication of the vote.  Votes shall be by
          netmail ballot to an independent enumerator.

          [Plurality as defined in FTA-1001:
          More votes than any other candidate, but less than a majority]

                                ===============
                                ACTION REQUIRED
                                ===============

     Effective immediately, any FTSC Standing Member may nominate a person
     for the position of FTSC Administrator, such nominations to be posted
     in the FTSC_PUBLIC echo.  Nominations close at 2359 UTC on Monday 27
     October 1997.

     At that time a list of all applicants having been properly nominated
     will be published in the FTSC_PUBLIC echo, and the voting process as
     defined above will then be followed.

     Barring unforeseen delays, it is anticipated that voting will commence
     at 0000 UTC on Friday 31 October 1997 and close at 2359 UTC on Friday
     21 November 1997.
