                            HOT NEWS

                Nothing of interest this week in the line of Hot
        News, in between holidays and all that stuff. Fido 1 is
        still down; newsletters are being mailed out from the secret
        Fido 99 location, so they should get out a little faster
        this week. (99 is on a private voice line, on my development
        machine which I use during the day, so it's not a public
        available number.)

                Articles are slowly coming in; keep mailing them!
        You can send articles to either Fido 1, 51 or 27, and they
        will make their way to me. If received late (after Sunday)
        then I may not get them in until the next week, but no
        problem.

                The FidoNet Users Group needs a new name. (The
        acronym, FUG, isn't too pleasant!) Any ideas? One idea is to
        choose a four word name, so that FIDO is an acronym, and
        that Fido is the first word in it, so that it's an
        infinitely recursive acronym, ie. "Fido Ixxx Dxxx Oxxx".
        Just an idea ... more (better?) ideas are welcome!

        Dallas, Texas (FNM) - A Dallas-area Fido sysop has taken Tom
        Tcmpidis' dilemma to heart.  After reading a FidoNews
        article describing the continuing plight of Mr. Tcmpidis,
        the realization that "open" bulletin board systems can be an
        invitation to would-be software pirates and other
        traffickers in illegal information led him to implement a
        security system to ensure that callers to this particular
        board were not "perfect strangers." 

         The means of "getting to know your callers" already exists
        within the current release of the Fido software, with the
        ability of Fido to screen callers who do not yet have a
        valid password, and to request information from new callers
        prior to the granting of full access to the features of the
        board.  This is described in "Fido's Operating Manual,"
        release 10, as the Private Message System.

        Most Fido sysops are aware that the capability for
        generating a "private" system exist, by simply adding the
        "/M" flag to the command line that starts the Fido software. 
        However, some may not have experimented with this, and it is
        the purpose of this article to describe such a system. 

        If the "/M" parameter is specified on the command line, Fido
        will not allow callers without an already-existing password
        to reach the Main Menu.  Instead, if a Questionnaire file,
        named QNOPWD.BBS, exists in the BBS directory, Fido will
        begin processing this questionnaire file, prompting the new







fidonews     --           31 Dec 84  18:21:10           Page 3

        caller to respond to the questions therein.

        Once the new user has responded to all the questions, Fido
        saves the responses in an "answer" file, known to the
        operating system as ANOPWD.BBS.  This sequential file keeps
        all responses from all new callers, allowing the system
        operator to review them, and add new callers to the USER
        file as desired.

        A sample of this kind of "new-user application" follows.

        A little tidbit about modems.....
        By: Jim Ryan, Fido #9

                If you are using one of the  "industry-standard"
        modems (one of the ones  that  uses  "Hayes"  protocol),
        here is a little tidbit of information that may help you
        avoid a system "crash".

                It is possible,  on occassion,  for a "gweep" to
        gain control of your modem by  entering three plus signs
        on a command line.  Although the  "gweep" usually cannot
        do more than stall your system for a  short time,  it is
        possible with certain modems to  disable  the system for
        hours.

                A neat little trick  is to  add the command line
        "ATS2=255" to your  FIDOMDM.BBS file.  This disables the
        modem break character, thereby preventing the problem.

                If anyone else has any good modem "tips", please
        leave me a note on one of the Connecticut Fido's  (until
        Fido #9 has a more permanent home).

        FIDO Suggestions
        ================
          Might I suggest that a section be added to the
        Fido_Newsletter  to collect modification suggestions from
        Fido Users?  To start  the list rolling, here are a few of
        my favorite requests:

        1.   Allow a user to Read Forward New.  When a user logs
        off, FIDO would save the highest message number retrieved in
        each System Area the user visited (limit of 10 areas).  At
        the users next call, issuing a Read Forward New command
        (perhaps a R= as opposed to the R* most of us use), would
        cause FIDO to determine the highest message number read by
        the user in this system area on their last connection and
        read forward from that point.

        [tj
                I'm now trying to figure out where to get the space
        to do this. It would have to work like this: since there are
        possibly up to 99 areas, all variable and changeable, Fido
        will keep track of say the last 8 used. This requires two
        bytes per msg area; the problem is that there is not 16
        bytes available in the users record; it may mean a hack
        program to convert the users record to a new format.

                Also, if you RENUM an area, all the numbers are
        wrong; this means that RENUM will have to be made to go
        through and translate all the msg numbers in the users
        record ]

        2.   File Dates.  When a file was uploaded, the FILES.BBS
        file could also include the date of upload.  It would then
        be possible to tell if any new files were uploaded since
        your last call via a FN (Files New) command.  

        [tj
                To be meaningful, the date has to be at least
        consistent, preferably the creation date, or at possibly the
        upload date. However, file dates are partially meaningless;
        the problem is that when uploaded via XMODEM (etc) the file
        is given the upload date, ie. created anew; TELINK, and
        direct disk copy, preserve the original date. Therefore, it







fidonews     --           31 Dec 84  18:21:27           Page 6

        is likely that you may have a later version of a program
        with an OLDER date on it. A meaningless date is worse than
        no date at all. For this reason, I skipped the date
        entirely. If anyone has a solution to this let me know!) ]

        3.   LIFO Users List.  When requesting a display of the FIDO      
        Users, the list could be presented in chronological order      
        (most recent caller first).  For remote SYSOPs, it would be      
        helpful to determine if the users uploaded/downloaded any      
        files.  Although similar to the SYSOP.LOG file, this would      
        contain abbreviated data and would be in LIFO sequence.

        [tj
                It is extremely difficult to write to a file
        "backwards", using a free form, not a preallocated file. The
        U command really should list them backwards, though, thats
        much easier. Ill see if I cant do that much.]

        4.   Ability to request a Net_Download.  A special message
        format (SYSOP privilege probably required) would allow
        dialing into another FIDO node and requesting download of
        particular software from a specified directory.  Thus the
        phone charges for file transmissions would be born by the
        requester. (Possible use includes retrieval of this FIDO
        Newsletter!).

        [tj
                ... also called "pick Up Mail", in Usenet called
        "Polling", ie. you can call in and see if there is mail or
        files. Real Soon Now ... realistically, 3 months ... ]

        5.   Attached File Validation.  When specifying that a file      
        should be attached to an outgoing networked message, FIDO      
        does not validate that the specified file exists.  It would      
        be very comforting to have this validation performed when      
        the file path was specified to eliminate the possibility of      
        typographical errors causing unwanted suprises on next      
        months phone bill!

        [tj
                Yes, but it is a two edged sword ... it is sometimes
        very useful to have it not check; ie. I send this newsletter
        out with preentered messages, before the file is copied in,
        so that hopefully by mail time the fiel is there and is sent
        out right. This is a classic "damned if I do, damned if I
        dont".

                Eventualyl, Fido will let users attach files, whats
        missing is the verification, and security and accounting.
        For sysops, it will work as it does now. For regular users,
        you will have to enter the filename(s) as:
        "12:FILENAME.EXT", where "12" is the file area number. This
        is a ways off, though. ]

        If you would like to add to this list, agree with one of
        these  suggestions, or disagree with them, feel free to send
        a FIDO_NET  message me.

        FIDO_FILES
        ==========
         On a related topic, several of us are thinking about
        developing a squeezed data file that could contain the
        names, sizes, dates, descriptions, and machine dependencies
        of user-contributed software residing in the public download
        sections of FIDO BBS's.  Our initial thoughts are to select
        one FIDO as the coordinating center (this might be on either
        Node 85 or Node 61 unless someone else really wants to
        volunteer). The database would be maintained in PC-FILE III,
        Version 2. The three files (.IDX, .HDR, and .DAT) would be
        loaded into a library file with LU.EXE and then squeezed
        with SQ2.EXE for efficient distribution. Thus FIDO users
        looking for particular public domain software would know
        where to call.


        FIDO_BOARD_DESCRIPTIONS
        =======================
          Along the same lines, a PC-FILE database could be created
        and centrally maintained that would list selected FIDO
        users, their nodes, interests, and areas of expertise. Say,
        for example, you need to contact someone experienced with
        writing assembler code inside of a TURBO Pascal application. 
        By referring to this database one could identify various
        people that have this knowledge and would be willing to help
        you out. If anyone has any comments on this idea, feel free
        to send a net_message to me.


        FINAL_THOUGHTS
        ==============
          Six months ago, I was convinced that the RBBS-PC software
        was the best BBS available for any machine. However, after
        being exposed to FIDO my opinion has really changed! The
        ability to use networked messages, separate message and file
        areas, and the scheduling capability of FIDO set it head and
        shoulders above the others! All of us owe a real debt of
        thanks to Tom Jennings who conceived, implemented, and
        continues to develop FIDO.

        Well, once again I have had the opportunity to test Fido
        with a few new modems.  Here are my results--  hope they
        are of some use to somebody..... somewhere.....

                The General DataComm 300/1200 Modems do not have
        dipswitches, but instead have a software dipswitch (like
        the Rixon  R212A and the Prentice  POPCOM).  In order to
        set the software  dipswitch,  you must have this in your

        Bit Flag   : 3/J
        Switches   : None

                In general, you shouldn't use the  Maxwell modem
        in Hayes mode-- the response time is terrible!!!! Use it
        in it's native Vadic mode, you'll both be much happier.
