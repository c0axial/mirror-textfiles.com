                              E-Mail Addiction

     My wife has often commented on the fact that the very first thing
     I do in the morning is to check my machine to see if I've  gotten
     any Fidomail.

     Surely it can wait; at least until I've dressed and consumed some
     oatmeal.

     What  is the attraction of Fidomail?  Why can't I at least wait a
     few minutes before reading it?

     I'm not the only one.  I have several friends who are in the same
     position.  One that I know of has TWIX run every  morning  as  an
     external  event  so  that he can tear off the paper and enjoy his
     Fidomail before doing anything else.

     Well, it is fast and cheap.  Being a node really adds very little
     to the phone bill.  Especially if one is fortunate enough  to  be
     part  of  a  bidirectional  net.  And overnight mail all over the
     country (world?) is a lure that may be hard to resist.

     But talking to a friend in a neighborhood  bar  is  even  faster.
     After all, as fast as Fidomail is, it still takes two days before
     you  get an answer.  Face-to-face it takes almost no time at all!
     And a typical conversation is free (drinks are extra, of course).

     So why is Fidomail so attractive?  Well,  one can talk to  people
     who  are  MUCH  farther  away  than  one would normally expect to
     travel.  I can safely say that I don't know anyone in  California
     (I'm in New Jersey) that I didn't meet through FidoNet.  In fact,
     of  all the people I know in California,  I have never met any of
     them face-to-face.

     I can go farther than that.  I have met  face-to-face  people  in
     Holland,  but  the  one  person  in  Holland  I know best is Henk
     Wevers, and I've known him only through FidoNet.

     It's easier somehow.  I am horrible about  writing  letters,  but
     good about answering Fidomail.  Most of it, I am sure, stems from
     simple  laziness.  For  either  USPO  mail or Fidomail I start by
     typing a letter into my machine.  With Fidomail  it  ends  there,
     but  with  the  USPO that is just the beginning.  I still have to
     print out the letter,  shove it into  an  envelope,  address  the
     envelope,  and  stick  a stamp on it.  Then (horror of horrors) I
     have to go find a mailbox to put it  in.  With  Fidomail  I  just
     write my reply and off it goes.  No two ways about it -- Fidomail
     will spoil you.

     Fido: 107/312
     UNIX: ihnp4!pyuxaa!gee

                       Environment Space in Fido 11t


     Using  information  given  me  by  Ken  Kaplan,  I  conducted  an
     experiment  and  determined  the  conditions  which Fido 11t will
     issue the message "Not enough memory to run" and  terminate  with
     ERRORLEVEL  3.  What I discovered,  after an exhaustive series of
     experiments,  was that  Fido  11t  appears  to  be  scanning  the
     environment  table  for  the  last  SET  variable  defined in the
     environment and then calculating the cumulative length of all the
     defined SET variables.  If the cumulative length is 100 bytes  or
     longer,  then  Fido  11t  will  issue the above error message and
     terminate.

     The  cumulative  length  of  the  SET  variables  may  be  easily
     determined by using the following commands:

         SET >set.out
         DIR set.out

     The  first  command  will dump out the SET strings defined in the
     environment into a file named "SET.OUT",  and the second  command
     will display the byte count of "SET.OUT".

     Using  this  method  I  booted  up  DOS  3.10  with the following
     directive in CONFIG.SYS:

         shell=c:\command.com c:\ /p /e:##

     Where I used the values 10, 30, and 60 for ##.

     I discovered that Fido 11t does not make any attempt to determine
     the actual amount of free environment space.  It checks to see if
     more than the first 99 bytes are used.  If so,  then it issues an
     error message and terminates.

                          11t Problem and Solution
                         by Ben Baker - Fido 100/76

          Many of you have noticed Version 11t's irritating  habit  of
     refusing  to  run,  terminating with the message "Not enough free
     memory to run," and error level set to 3.  This is  a  particular
     problem  of  the IBM version,  but actually affects all versions.
     Gee Wong was the first to report the  relationship  between  this
     problem and the size of the environment strings.

          First I will explain the problem,  and then give you a solu-
     tion.  If you are not technically inclined,  feel free to skip to
     the solution below.

                                The Problem

          Fido  is  written  in  the  C language and compiled with the
     Lattice compiler using the "small data model."  The  small  model
     allows  the  program  to  use 16-bit pointers to data rather than
     32-bit segment/offset pointers.  This makes  a  program  signifi-
     cantly  faster,  but imposes a constraint on the data.  ALL data;
     compiled data,  stack data and dynamically  allocated  data  must
     reside in a single 64K data segment.

          When  Fido  begins execution,  it checks to see if the total
     allocatable memory is above the  minimum  it  needs  to  operate.
     Allocatable  memory  is 64K minus the sum of fixed data and stack
     size.  If that amount is insufficient,  it  terminates  with  the
     above  error  condition  and message.  The IBM version appears to
     have the largest fixed data area and is most susceptible  to  the
     problem.

          What  has this to do with the environment strings?  That's a
     little more subtle.  When using the small  model,  all  data  the
     program  needs  must  be in the 64K data segment.  If the program
     will access the environment strings,  it can only do so if  there
     is  a  copy  in the data segment.  Since the C initializer cannot
     know in advance whether the program  will  need  the  environment
     strings,  it  always  copies the environment to the data segment!
     Therefore,  the larger  the  environment,  the  less  allocatable
     memory Fido has to work with.

                                The Solution

          There are two variables we can adjust; environment size, and
     stack size.  FIDO_IBM will execute properly if the sum of the two
     is  less  that 18100 bytes.  The threshold for the other versions
     is not known,  but seems  to  be  somewhat  higher  (safer).  The
     default stack size is 18000.  The size of your environment can be
     determined with the following two DOS commands:

               SET >SET.TXT
               DIR SET.TXT

          The  file  size is the approximate size of your environment.
     The best solution to the  problem  is  to  reduce  this  size  by
     shortening  or  eliminating your PATH and/or PROMPT strings until
     the size of SET.TXT is less than 100 bytes.


     Fidonews                     Page 4                   24 Feb 1986





          If that is unacceptable,  there is an  alternative.  Lattice
     makes  provisions to adjust the stack size at execution time.  If
     the first command line argument has the form  "=<number>"  the  C
     initializer will use <number> as the stack size.  For instance:

               FIDO_IBM =17900 <switches>

     would set the stack to 17900 bytes,  allowing an environment size
     of up to 200 bytes.

          We believe that Fido will run properly with stack  size  set
     as  low  as  17000  bytes,  but  have not tested it exhaustively.
     Remember,  the lower you set it,  the greater you  risk  a  STACK
     OVERFLOW error.

          One  last  point.  When  this error occurs,  Fido exits with
     ERRORLEVEL = 3.  Therefore,  3 is NOT VALID for external  events.
     We  recommend  that  all  external events use ERRORLEVELs of 4 or
     above,  and that you test for 3 in your batch file and  terminate
     if it or any lower error occurs.

                          Fido compatible systems
                          -----------------------

                         A.T.L 101/4603 or 501/4603
                             Lidkoping, Sweden


          I, as almost every Fido sysop, have the intention of writing
     my own Fido-compatible BBS.  I'm determined to do so, but I don't
     really know at which end to begin.  Writing a plain  vanilla  BBS
     with  a  message  area  and  a  file area isn't such a great job.
     Actually I once  wrote  a  small  BBS  system  in  6809  assembly
     language  for  FLEX  9.0.  However the big problem is the FidoNet
     interface.  Writing code that can send, receive and route mail is
     quite a big job,  not to mention debugging it.  Then it  suddenly
     struck  me,  why  should  I do that job when somebody has already
     done it?  Namely Tom Jennings with Fido.  All I have to do is  to
     write  my  BBS  and  for the FidoNet area I only have to make the
     files the same as Fido's.  I can then start Fido from my  BBS  at
     the  right  time  and it'll do the job and then return to my BBS,
     via an external event.  The only  Fido  routines  I  need  in  my
     system  are  a  scheduler  and  some  way  to  make the *.MSG and
     SYSTEM??.BBS for the FidoNet area.  The rest of the system I  can
     design for my own taste.

          So  here's one suggestion.  Why doesn't Tom Jennings release
     a FidoNet handler,  consisting of the FidoNet parts of  Fido.  It
     could then be invoked by something like:

                         C>fidonet /2 60/W A/S

          which would mean: Start FidoNet using COM2: and run schedule
     A for 60 minutes and then terminate.

     Fido 107/17

                                Lazy Sysops


     I recently came up with a new use of the POLL command  -  and  it
     has  nothing  to do with FIDO!  It is a bit obscure,  but came in
     very handy recently during a time when there was no  alarm  clock
     available in my home.  Then I got to thinking - alarm clock?  Who
     needs one when you have a FidoNet system downstairs!

     Well, here's the scoop - most sysops have a separate phone number
     dedicated as their DATA line,  but why not have another Fido node
     on your VOICE line!  No,  I don't mean to actually run  a  system
     from the other line,  just fool the REAL Fido into thinking there
     is another Fido in the same house!

     In my house,  every morning,  I run an additional mail  event  at
     7:15  for  a  period of 3 minutes.  In my route files,  I have my
     REAL Fido POLL the FAKE Fido during this  event,  which  being  3
     minutes in duration,  I get at least two wake-up calls!  The only
     trick comes to play by "creating" a new  node  in  the  nodelist.
     This can easily be accomplished by manual editing of the file, or
     having  LISTGEN change the phone number of an existing node;  one
     that wouldn't be called.

     So, if you are lazy, or don't have an alarm clock,  you no longer
     have an excuse for over sleeping!

             Well, it has been a little over 3 weeks since the shuttle
     disaster.  Since that time,  I have collected a  little  over  60
     messages  between my two FIDO nodes,  and a little over 700 pages
     of   messages   from   UUCP/USENET   (primarily   net.space   and
     net.columbia)  as  well  as direct UUCP mail.  In response to the
     article I placed in the FIDONEWS 2 weeks  ago,  I  have  received
     several messages from both users and SYSOPS.  Well, I am going to
     Senator  Garn's  office  at  the  end of the month.  Time for the
     SYSOPs to bundle those shuttle-related messages into an ARC,  and
     FIDOMAIL  them  to  me  at  109/74.  Please  use  a  file name of
     XXXYYY.51L,  where XXX is your net or region number  and  YYY  is
     your  node  number,  to prevent message clashes.  Thanks for your
     efforts.  I will let you know what happens.

     Allen Tufts
     Fido 101/113

                               MAIL TIME WOES


     Actually,  I think there are many more people that are irked with
     the  National  Mail  Slot than just Bob Hartman.  I have to agree
     with Bob,  there is a definite problem brewing.  There have  been
     times  when  it  has taken me up to three days to deliver mail to
     the hosts of 132 and 101, and I'm sure the problem goes beyond my
     local area Hosts.

     My proposal,  and I'm sure it is not a new one,  is to allow mail
     to  be  sent or received at ANY time.  You would probably want to
     keep the local mail time at 5:00am  as  it  is  now.  This  gives
     people  a  drop  dead  time  to  get  their messages in for local
     delivery.  It should be a very simple  task  to  enable  Fido  to
     distinguish  whether  an  incoming  call is a User or FidoNet and
     then take the appropriate action.  Leave it up to  the  Sysop  of
     the  calling  system  as  to  when he wants his system to deliver
     mail.  If he wants to deliver his mail at noontime each day, then
     let him do it.

     I realize that getting Fido to accept mail at any  time  is  only
     half  the  problem.  Mail  distribution under the proposed method
     could create some logistical problems,  but I think they would be
     minor and can be overcome.


     Another  topic  I  would  like  to  raise  while I am writing the
     article is Fido's inability to  notify  a  user  upon  successful
     logon  that he has mail waiting.  I consider this to be a serious
     flaw with Fido.  I don't like having to enter a message area of a
     system and check every directory for mail.  The search  for  mail
     can  take a fair amount of time considering the extensive message
     areas and amount of messages that some systems have.  If Fido  is
     going  consider itself a serious EMAIL network,  then at the very
     least it should report something similar to the following:

     You have mail waiting...

     This feature MUST tell you the areas and message numbers or  else
     you  are not really gaining a useful feature.  Maybe if enough of

         Once again I've found some free time!  How I don't know,  but
     I've  done  it.  Most  of  the time I sit down at my computer and
     wonder "has there ever been a program that uses every key on  the
     computer  (A-Z)?"  Well  I  took care of this problem and created
     USELESS.BAS.  Its exactly that.  It doesn't do  a  single  thing!
     Sure  it  draws a picture,  plays a song and spins the disk drive
     but besides that it has no real purpose.  I doubt anybody has  it
     (or  wants  it)  but  It will soon be available on Elite Software
     (409)-846-4367 117/1262.  I plan on writing more humorous  spoofs
     on  programing.  USLESSII will be out soon.  In it I will use the
     function keys and the Ctrl and Alt keys.  If you have  any  other
     Ideas  let me know for and I'll set my limited programming skills
     to work.


     Other programs I have written:

         ZOR.BAS
         ZORII.BAS
         DOCIBM.BAS
         USELESS.BAS
         ZOR3.BAS


     Now if you'll excuse me,  I need to find  my  voter  registration

     There are several "small" companies among us that are advertising
     vaporware,  be it  hardware  or  software.  Under  the  guise  of
     offering  some super fantastic piece of hard/software are selling
     other  items  other  than  the  advertised   vaporware   to   the
     unsuspecting  clients.  It is a neat ploy that is even frowned on
     by some of the larger companies as deceptive business practices.

     Buyer beware,  it would be to everyone's advantage to cease doing
     business with companies that tend to pull this slight deception.

     I'm  all  for advertising a soon to be released item.  However it
     is not in the  best  interest  of  our  community  for  the  same
     companies  to continue to advertise items that appear to never to

     with these vapor ware companies.

                             Notes from Abroad


     Following the installation of a 20 Meg hard disk on my Compaq,  I
     thought  I would report on the problems I encountered.  The drive
     is supplied in a sealed anti-static bag to protect the  circuitry
     which  is in turn enclosed in a cardboard sleeve.  The controller
     card is supplied in a well padded anti-static bag.  Also supplied
     is a blanking plate, two ribbon cables, and a users manual .

     The first thing to do when fitting a new  piece  of  hardware  to
     your  system  is to read the manual.  The manual supplied is just
     fourteen pages long and covers the installation procedure for  an
     IBM PC.  There is a small section on setting the two DIP switches
     on  the  main  circuit board of the drive.  I always seem to have
     trouble with DIP switches,  so I decided to only set one  switch,
     this was the switch marked "D" and with this switch set to on the
     diagnostic option was selected.

     The  next  section  in  the  manual  details  the  drive's  power
     requirements.  The first line caught me out,  it  said  that  the
     drive  requires  an  external  power supply.  I presume that this
     section was for anyone who was thinking of fitting the  drive  as
     an external unit.

     The  next  step was to take the lid off the Compaq and remove the
     B:  drive.  This would have been a 2 minute job on an IBM PC  but
     on a Compaq it involves removing the floppy controller card,  the
     graphics card,  and any  add-on  cards.  When  these  cards  were
     removed  the  drive  came  out quite easily after unceremoniously
     turning the Compaq on it's side,  removing the bottom cover,  and
     removing the fixing screws from the bottom of the drive.

     This  now  leaves  a  gaping hole in the front of the Compaq so I
     quickly put the new drive in position to  see  how  the  locating
     holes  lined  up.  It soon became obvious that the locating holes
     in the Compaq chassis were intended to take a  full  height  hard
     disk.  The  shock  absorbing  mounting pillars are fitted only on
     the right hand side of the chassis so anything fitted next to the
     hard disk will have to find an alternative mounting method.  As I
     have no plans (or money!) to fit something  else  in  the  gap  I
     decided  it would be best to simply mount the hard disk and cover
     the hole with the supplied blanking plate.

     The holes lined up well with the mounting  pillars  and  once  in
     place it looks very neat tucked into the right hand corner of the
     Compaq.  With  the  drive  in  place  I then proceeded to fit the
     ribbon cables.  Following the instructions in the manual  to  the
     word  I  fitted  the  cables  to the drive and then connected the
     other end to the controller card.  The controller card has  three
     connectors,  two  twenty  way,  and one thirty-four way.  You are
     supplied with one 34 way cable and one 20 way cable.  The  manual
     shows  which of the 20 way connectors to use.  I assumed that the
     second 20 way connector was for another hard disk;  but  a  phone


     Fidonews                     Page 12                  24 Feb 1986





     call  revealed  that  it  was  actually for a tape streamer.  The
     controller card apparently supports either  10  or  25  meg  tape
     streamers.

     Unfortunately I fitted one of the cables incorrectly but I didn't
     realise  this until I had switched on the Compaq.  This may sound
     like a fatal error but Western Digital has  made  the  controller
     idiot  proof;  ie  safeguarded  the circuitry against people like
     myself who are incapable  of  following  a  manual.  I  certainly
     don't  recommend that you fit the cables incorrectly,  but if you
     do the chances are that no damage will be done.

     After the first (failed) attempt to install the drive I  reversed
     the incorrectly fitted connector and then tried again.  This time
     success!  The  drive  burst  into life and then proceeded through
     its self checking routine.  The suppliers had told  me  that  the
     drive  was  pre-formatted  and  tested,  and also that the PC-DOS
     operating system had been installed.  This means that  the  drive
     should  be configured to use as a boot disk.  I opened the floppy
     drive door and then re-booted.  It tried to boot off the A: drive
     but as the drive was not ready it proceeded to boot from the hard
     disk.  Booting off the hard disk is a much quicker operation than
     booting off a floppy although the hard disk does take time to  go
     through its diagnostics.  If you don't have much memory installed
     in  your  machine  it  is  possible that the computers diagnostic
     routines will be quicker that the hard disks diagnostics; in this
     case I suppose it is possible that  a  "drive  not  ready"  error
     could occur.  This condition would of course be rectified as soon
     as you press a key.

     So  there I was with my brand new hard disk humming quietly (very
     quietly) in the background just waiting for some data to  swallow
     up.  I  proceeded  to  feed  the  hard  disk a couple of files to
     install in my new AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  I followed  this  operation
     with  a CHKDSK which returned a gratifying 21184512 bytes of free
     space!

                           The World of Computing

                                     by
                     Reuven M. Lerner, FidoMail 107/33

       Welcome again  to  The  World  of  Computing!  This  time,  I'm
     writing  to  you  from  my  new  Fountain  PC,  which  is  an IBM
     compatible computer.  The version  I  have  has  two  half-height
     floppy  drives,  plus  a  hard disk.  I also have a nice internal
     modem, so I can log onto Fido and other local BBS'.  However, I'd
     like to address the issue of IBM compatibility.  In a  way,  it's
     nice  to  have  a standard,  but in other ways,  why should we be
     forced to stay in the world  of  MS-DOS  when  new  and  improved
     operating  systems  can  be  used?  Let's go back in time to late
     1980,  when the IBM PC was still just on the drawing  board,  and
     they  were  trying  to figure out which processor they would use.
     Intel had come out with the 8088 about a year before,  which  was
     an 8/16 processor,  but a newer, and more powerful one (the 8086,
     a true 16-bit processor) was on the market.  IBM had  a  dilemma:
     do  they  use  the newer and as-of-yet untested 8086,  or do they
     stick with the 8088, of which they could get millions if need be?
     You and I both know that they decided to use the 8088.

       Now we get to the operating system.  At first,  they wanted  to
     use  the  standard  CP/M  operating  system,  which had been very
     successful in the 8-bit world.  To make a very long story  short,
     Digital  Research  didn't  want to keep so secret about IBM's new
     machine.  IBM went to Microsoft Corp.  and  asked  them  if  they
     could  make  an  operating system.  Microsoft went out and bought
     another company's operating system, renamed it MS-DOS and PC-DOS,
     put their BASIC on the disk, and had a new operating system.

       Unfortunately,  version 1.0 of MS-DOS had a few bugs and wasn't
     powerful  enough  for  many users.  Plus which,  IBM had included
     only 64K in their original version (then again,  who needed  more
     than 64K back then?).  They went back and revamped it, and pretty
     soon, came out with the MS-DOS that you and I know.

       Well,  enough  of  the  story.  Let's  get back to the original
     point.  Is IBM compatibility good or bad?  The answer  is  "yes."
     For the past few years, I have used a wonderful DEC VT180 (which,
     I  may  add,  is still my favorite writing machine.  I'm going to
     use it again starting next week) which ran  good  'ol  CP/M  2.2.
     Now  that  I  have  this  hard  disk  and  all,  I have virtually
     unlimited storage, easier-to-use communications, and a lot more.

       In the past week, I've downloaded about 10 programs,  including
     the  word  processor  that I'm writing this on,  DVED 6.02 -- not
     bad, but not so great, either.

       I'm downloading PC-WRITE in a few days to compare the two.  All
     public-domain or shareware (have  you  paid  for  your  shareware
     today?).  It's  incredible  what you can do!  I have an automatic
     screen-blanker,  a  pop-up  calculator,   and  a  Halley's  Comet
     simulation,   with   no   worries   about   it   working   on  my
     machine/terminal/etc.  like I have to on the DEC.  And if it does
     work on the DEC, I usually have to use DDT to change the terminal
     parameters.


     Fidonews                     Page 14                  24 Feb 1986





       But,  as  with any machine,  there are problems.  First of all,
     that stupid memory test at the beginning.  Let's use some  simple
     math to see how long the POST test SHOULD take:

       Assuming  that  the DEC has about a 2 MHz clock speed,  and the
     IBM 4.77,  the DEC 64K and the IBM  640K,  the  IBM  should  take
     0.2385  as much time as the DEC for the memory test!  But no.  It
     takes about 45 seconds,  enough to drive me insane when I'm in  a
     rush.

       So far,  I like the Fountain.  It's a nice little machine,  and
     I'll report on any new developments when I get some new software.


       Manual Typewriters

       Some of you may find this little personal anecdote  interesting
     to   hear:   I've  been  using  word  processors  and  electronic
     typewriters exclusively for the past four  years,  so  it's  very
     rare  that  I  have  to use a manual typewriter.  About two weeks
     ago,  I had to use one,  and after typing a full line,  I reached
     out for the RETURN key,  and lo and behold,  it wasn't there!  It
     took me a full five minutes before I  realized  that  the  little
     lever in front of me was the RETURN key's equivalent.

       Besides  being  a  little funny now that I look back at it,  it
     brings a serious point to  mind.  We  in  the  computer  age  are
     spoiled.  That's  right,  spoiled.  We  have  everything so easy,
     writing is a dream.  I probably  wouldn't  be  as  interested  in
     writing  on  the side if I didn't have some electronic components
     in my typewriter or computer.

       We should just think of the people who came before us, and what
     they had to use.  I'm sure many of you reading this are from  the
     generation  that  was  around  when  electronic  typewriters  (or
     electric, for that matter) were very rare items,  and very costly
     besides.

       I  just  wonder  what  it's going to be like in another hundred
     years.


       Software Piracy

       To give you an update on the software  piracy  article  that  I
     wrote  on  these pages here several weeks ago,  I have prepared a
     file called OATH.TXT,  which I will send to you via  FidoMail  if
     you  so  request.  It's  one  of  those things that you download,
     print, and sign your name on.  The full title is TAKE THE OATH.

       Basically,  it says that you pledge not to  buy  copy-protected
     software,  give  away,  take,  buy  or  sell  illegal  copies  of
     software,  or buy software that is overpriced  (this  is  a  very
     subjective point, I leave it in your hands).

       What's  the  purpose?  To get computer users to agree on points
     which will change the face of computing for a while.  If we don't
     act now, no one will,  and we will live with the consequences for

     a while.

       On  another note,  a certain member of my family came home last
     night with some copied software.  I talked with him, and although
     he realized that it's wrong,.  he gave  a  valid  point.  Someone
     with  a  busy  job  just  doesn't have time to waste.  trying out
     different pieces of software when he's not sure  what  he  really
     wants.

       He's not going to take the oath for a while.


       Next time

       Next  week,  I  hope to say something about the Macintosh Plus,
     and a little on. computer jargon and new words that we are using.
     Again, I invite all comments. and questions at the address below.
     Until next week, happy computing!

     We have a confession to make.  We've been  holding  out  on  you.
     For  several years now we've been using a program called MACRO to
     boost our productivity.  But we've  been  keeping  it  a  closely
     guarded secret.  Even our most intimate clients have been unaware
     of it's existence.  Now,  however, we've decided to release it to
     the PC user community.

     If you have ever used a macro assembler,  then you  already  know
     how  useful  macros  can be.  For the rest of you,  well,  a good
     macro processor can do half of your work  for  you.  MACRO  works
     with  any  normal text file,  and hence can be used as a powerful
     front-end to almost any language.  Here's a sample of what  MACRO
     can do for you:

     1. Put parameters in your programs, allowing you to easily change
        table sizes, ranges of values, and so forth.

     2. Put  conditional code in your programs,  allowing you to write
        one program,  and then "switch" parts on and  off  easily  for
        different customers and applications.

     3. Perform integer arithmetic and string manipulation before your
        program is compiled, saving run time.

     4. Write  programs  that  customize  themselves  when you compile
        them,  based on commands given and questions  answered  during

           Now available from Micro Consulting Associates!!

     Public Domain collection - 300+ "ARC" archives - 10 megs  of
     software  and  other  goodies,  and  that's "archived" size!
     When unpacked,  you get approximately 17 megabytes worth  of
     all  kinds  of  software,  from  text  editors  to  games to
     unprotection schemes to communications programs,  compilers,
     interpreters, etc...

     This  collection  is  the  result  of more than 10 months of
     intensive downloads from just about 100 or  more  BBS's  and
     other sources,  all of which have been examined, indexed and
     archived for your convenience.  Starting  a  Bulletin  Board
     System?  Want  to  add  on  to  your  software  base without
     spending thousands of dollars? This is the answer!!!

     To order the library,  send $100 (personal or company check,
     postal money order or company purchase order) to:

                    Micro Consulting Associates
                    Post Office Box 4296
                    200-1/2 E. Balboa Boulevard
                    Balboa, Ca. 92661-4296

     Please allow 3 weeks for delivery of your order.

     Note:  No  profit is made from the sale of the Public Domain
     software in this collection.  The price is applied  entirely
     to  the  cost  of  downloading  the  software over the phone
     lines,  running a  BBS  to  receive  file  submissions,  and
     inspecting,   cataloguing,  archiving  and  maintaining  the
     files. Obtaining this software yourself through the use of a
     computer with a modem using commercial  phone  access  would
     cost you much more than what we charge for the service...

     Please  specify what type of format you would like the disks
     to be prepared on.  The following choices are available:

             IBM PC-DOS Backup utility
             Zenith MS-DOS 2.11 Backup Utility
             DSBackup
             Fastback
             Plain  ol' files (add $50,  though,  it's a lot  of
             work and takes more diskettes...)

     Add  $30  if  you want the library on 1.2 meg AT disks (more
     expensive  disks).   There  are  no  shipping  or   handling
     charges.  California residents add 6% tax.

     For each sale, $10 will go to the FidoNet Administrators.
