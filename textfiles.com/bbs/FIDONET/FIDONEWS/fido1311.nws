    Two weeks ago, I wrote an editorial that concluded with:

           It would be real nice to have  a  migration
        pattern.   I  want  to hook in and get mail at
        dtees@fidonet.org.  I want  my  users  to  get
        mail at joe_smith@exlibris.fidonet.org.

    There have been several articles since, but the gist of the
articles has been "you are right, we have to change".  My
response is less than enthusiastic.  "Yes, I know, it is
obvious. *How* do we change".  A much more difficult question
altogether.

    Internet, of course, is a net of nets.  We are a net.  One
of the largest in the world, in fact.  So why are we not members
of internet?  Because our mail is incompatible.  How can we
get it compatible?  There are only two methods: create it as
comaptible, or convert it.

    Creating it compatible is the cleanest, and probably the
easiest.  Take a PC, plug in LINUX.  Everybody converts.  We
hook up using the same routing.  We tear out our hair for a few
months, maybe run both ways on different days of the week for a
while.  I can hear the screams of anguish already.

    But you know, we are sysops.  We have already organized a
world wide communications network, and a world wide net newspaper.
No other non-governmental organization has ever accomplished
what we have.  If we cannot figure out a way to use that
creation to organize a conversion, then we are a bunch of damned
fools.

    Given 32,000 helpers, I do not even envision a big problem.
We have the buying power to set up a load and go conversion CD
if we can decide what we want as a starting point. I *know*
that there are people in this net are capable of setting
something like that up.

   There are other methods as well. But like it or not, we are
going to have to change. There is no new software being
written. The hardware is running out. It is time to bite the bullet
and face reality.

Free Listings in the Encyclopedia of Associations

Free Listings in the Encyclopedia of Associations

People who start new new non-profit associations (including
othernets, lobbying groups and associations having nothing to do
with BBSes) should get their group listed, free of charge, in
FidoNews 13-11                 Page:  3                    11 Mar 1996

the Encyclopedia of Associations, so that prospective members,
journalists and researchers can get in touch with them.

Groups based in the U.S. should write to the following address
and ask to be listed:
 Editor
 Encyclopedia of Associations
 Gale Research Inc.
 835 Penobscot Building
 Detroit, MI 48226-4094
 Telephone (313) 961-2242
 Fax (313) 961-6815

Groups based outside the United States should instead get listed
in International Organizations, a directory published by the same
company. Its address is:
 Editor
 International Organizations
 Gale Research Inc.
 835 Penobscot Building
 Detroit, MI 48226-4094
 U.S.A.
 Telephone +1 313 961-2242
 Fax +1 313 961-6815

As well, groups based outside the United States may also want to
get listed in single-country association directories published
in their own country, such as the Directory of Associations in
Canada. Any librarian should be able to tell you how to get in
touch with your country's national association directory, if
one exists.

Most large libraries have a copy of the Encyclopedia of
Associations in hard copy or CD-ROM, but it is probably too
expensive for someone to buy for home use.

Use It or Lose It
From: Eric Gray (1:300/507)

                       Use It or Lose It.

 The next six months will determine the fate of Fidonet. Two years
 ago I saw the handwriting on the wall and started actively seeking
 other networks and starting some echos of my own. Last year Circuit
 Net broke w/years of the status quo and changed their software to
 allow non Spitfire systems to join their net. Last year the
 internet grew at the rate of 2 million users per month. The only
 reason Fidonet is still alive today is the dedication of the
 individual sysops who have taken the steps needed to keep their
 boards as fresh and exciting as possible.

FidoNews 13-11                 Page:  4                    11 Mar 1996

 But Fido has sat stagnant for almost 4 years now. In the next six
 months we will either bury it, or Fido will explode again as it did
 8 years ago.

 The changes that will make this happen are:

  Voting by member sysops for all positions w/in Fido.

  Changing technology slightly to have HOURLY turn-around on msgs
  sending.

  Supplementing the system to allow the movement of files w/in 24
  hours from the request of any user on any Fido Sysop's board.

  A User and A Sysop "Bill of Fido Rights" to be "hashed out" by the
  member sysops and users and voted upon by each sysop, w/any
  "right" gaining over 2/3rd affirmative vote being put into the
  "Bill of Fido Rights."

 Sure those running Fidonet now could say "It's worked for years
 this way, there's no need to change it." But then, that's what they
 said about the typewriter, the LP, and the light bulb. Make no
 mistake, Fidonet is at the root of the Internet and computer
 communications explosion, but if Fido doesn't keep up w/the people,
 it'll die.

Prime Directive
by Bill Whitehouse

     After 8 years, the fido policy I continue to find most appealing is
its 'promote the growth of network' prime directive, a requirement that
assumes like any other living organism or human enterprise, unless fido
grows, fido dies...

     Snooze editor Donald Tees is right, my fellow fidonuts. The numbers
confirm it. Fidonet is dying.

     Blaming our appointed coordinators is all too easy. They've long
since ceased to promote the growth of this network, unless they can
self-promote every last dime out of it. Witness the fact that with 4
primary North American fido vendors, the oaficial area lists now reflect
reality for only one of them.

     No, our coordinators are only a symptom. We've seen the enemy and
the real enemy is us. Remember those quaint days of yesteryear when many
feared the phone company megaliths would finally contrive to shut down
bbsing forever?

     We've forgotten why we're here, what makes fido unique. We belong
FidoNews 13-11                 Page:  5                    11 Mar 1996

to a network that belongs to all of us, and anyone else who cares to add
their resources to the collective whole.

     The internet, by contrast, is a cold, barren place, populated by
anonymous geeks with no sense of community, stumbling around computers
they do not own, resources in whose management they have no say. No
one's responsible. Everyone's vulnerable. And they're squandering a
fortune.

     This - fidonet - is personal. As in 'personal computer'? We each
control our own small part of it. We built it. It's ours. Fidonet has
earned and deserves a place in the future of the networked world.

     Speaking as one bbs obsessive to another, I urge you to promote it
with the zeal of a Jehovah's Witness. Please don't give up.

The Death Of Fidonet, Revisited...
Kurt Weiske
realitycheckBBS (Fidonet 1:161/418)

The continual death knell for Fidonet, well, it continues. here's yet
another 2 cents added to the discussion...

Fidonet for all intents and purposes is not DYING, but there is
competition from usenet, the internet in general, othernets using
Fido-Technology networking, and public-access online services like
Compuserve and America online. Fidonet is no longer The Net; the
internet, and the scores of Fido-technology "Othernets" are attractive
alternatives to callers and sysops alike.

Competition isn't bad, it merely prompts changes. The BBS Salad days
may have passed, but there's no need to pack up and go home...yet.
Competition isn't bad, it merely inspires change. So, what can we do?

Support your local network:

    Build a local online community if you don't already have a series
    of local echoes. Build in some local flavor, give the users and
    sysops a local focus - that's one thing the internet CANNOT offer.

    Support your local network and look into making your local routing
    to make Fidonet more cost-effective to the net. Some local nets
    are getting sprawled out to the point where polling your "local"
    net is a toll call - this can be reduced by local hops, and ties
    into my next point...

Make Fidonet more attractive to potential Sysops and Users:

    Call around to your local non-netted BBSes, invite them into
    Fidonet. I usually mention the local echoes available for no cost
FidoNews 13-11                 Page:  6                    11 Mar 1996

    and the BBS support echoes - most of my technical problems were
    solved by asking around - someone's run into your problem before,
    and someone's usually willing to help. If there's a local call and
    a low CRP figure in your local net, you may be able to pick up a
    few Sysops that were waiting to be sold.

    We all take for granted that we're connected to a worldwide
    network. To a newbie, seeing messages tossed into your message
    base from Nebraska, Europe, and the BBS next door is a rush.
    Remember that feeling? Try to sell that to prospective sysops.

    Does your net have an internet gateway? Use that as a selling
    point to get new users. I offer internet email through my gateway,
    and people who are new to the 'net, but want to have mail access
    only find it much more attractive than paying for an online
    service that offers more than they need.

ADVERTISE!

    Get the word out on your BBS. Advertise in the local computer
    magazines (If your area is lucky enough to have 'em). Call other
    BBSes and add your phone number to their BBS list. Does your BBS
    support BBS lists? If not, add a list program. Put your number in
    your .sig file, advertise in alt.bbs.ads, advertise wherever you
    can think of. Post a BBS ad to your local message area, and ask
    callers to post it on BBSes they call regularly. If you offer text
    file downloads, consider adding your BBS name and number to the
    files (It's amazing how far those get distributed - most of my
    European callers got the number from text files.) Get The Word
    Out.

Fidonet has a lot to offer in comparison to the internet. The usenet
crowd has been overtaken by @aol.com kids on free ten-hour disks, the
glut of .edu kids, and cross-posts from hell. Fidonet echomail offers
mostly on-topic moderated echoes, a decent selection of message
topics, and a well-rounded mix of people- Fido seems to reach the
people who aren't in reach of cheap flat-rate internet providers, and
people with different experiences to offer than their internet
counterparts. I see the internet and Fidonet as complements, not
competition.

Make a change, and think about what you can do to make Fidonet work.
There's a lot of people involved in Fidonet. What would happen if one
out of ten of us did something?
