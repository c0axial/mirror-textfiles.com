                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================

     Hello there.    I've  been meaning to write a little something here
     for several weeks  now and just haven't gotten around to it.  Maybe
     next week I'll find the time.

     The major reason that I decided to key in anything at all this week
     was to let you know that next week we will publish responses to the
     Policy4 issue of FidoNews.  As  it appears that these responses are
     on  the  LONG  side,  the odds are that we won't publish any  other
     articles next week,  though  whether we publish columns or not will
     be a function of how much space the articles take up.

     Thanks for reading this rag.  I think it's a  pretty  good one.  By
     the way, feel free to help keep it that way by  sending  along some
     material for publication.

     Cheers,
     Vince

                    Announcement of Eurocon III 1989.


     At Eurocon II European sysops have agreed that some sort of
     central European organization should be formed which should
     control or administer European FidoNet.  Several committees have
     been appointed to draft proposals for such an organization.  As
     the committees have nearly concluded their work we wish to invite
     you to take part in the process of whether or not to form a
     European organization.

     The principal idea is to establish an organization which could be
     named European FidoNet Association, or EFNA.  It would not be
     meant as a separation from International FidoNet but as an
     organization which would represent Zone 2 FidoNet sysops in IFNA.
     Thus we would have a start in reorganizing IFNA in which e.g.
     American FNA, European FNA and Oceanic FNA would take part.

     To discuss the proposals, we are organizing a conference called
     EuroCon III in the weekend of May 19, 20 and 21 in Eindhoven, The
     Netherlands.  We are currently in the process of inviting some
     introducing speakers.  Apart from the official part of the
     conference we are organizing an interesting tour.  Also, the
     Dutch HCC and PCC are inviting you to a drink on Thursday
     evening.

     The main theme at EuroCon III will be "Democracy and European
     FidoNet".

     Attached you will find a registration form.  The filled in form
     can be sent to: Hans Ligthelm of 2:500/30, or Joop Mellaart of
     2:512/0.  (If you have a problem with the nodelist: Joop's AKA is
     2:2/1)

     We have tried to offer you excellent hotel accomodations for a
     reasonable price.  The reservation procedure has changed a bit
     but price and quality are the same as in 1988.

     We hope to meet a lot of you so that we can have a succesful
     European conference.


     Cheers, Peter.  (Secretary of the EuroCon III organization
     committee)

             The Future of DOS - Will You Be Forced To Abandon It?

     DOS  has become the most popular operating  system  on  the  planet
     Earth.  Millions of people use it every day.  Now OS/2 and Unix are
     being  offered  to  PC users to enhance the capabilities  of  their
     computers.  Do you need to change?  Maybe not.    This seminar will
     cover how DOS can be used far into the future.   There  are ways to
     get  DOS  to  manage  almost  all  of  the  features of these other
     operating systems,  and  yet  still  use  much  of the hardware and
     software you ave  today.    Find  out  how  DOS  can  be  improved,
     expanded, and extended.

     Expanded and Extended Memory - What is it?  How do you use it?

     For  PC-DOS  computers, the amount of memory you have is not always
     as  important  as what kindof memory it is.  Some people wonder how
     it can  be  that  they  have 2 megabytes of memory and yet they can
     only use 640K  of it.  Gary Saxer, one of the country's top experts
     on DOS memory, will  explain  the differences between Conventional,
     Reserved, Extended, Expanded, Enhanced Expanded,  and  EMS4 memory.
     Tips on how to get the  best out of your current memory and methods
     to  improve memory use and availability will  be  covered.    Also,
     methods to convert useless memory into memory that  DOS  can handle

     Computers with  the golden opportunities to sample many programs to
     improve productivity on  an  individual  system,  without investing
     thousands of dollars in  commercially distributed software.  Author
     of Automenu, one of the  most  successful shareware programs on the
     market, Marshall will further discuss the means of making shareware
     work for the programer who is contemplating  releasing  programs to
     the market.

      3 pm - Gus Venditto - Senior Executive Editor - PC Magazine

     SHAREWARE IN THE '90s -- CAN IT SURVIVE OS/2?

     The Microsoft mulit-tasking juggernaut threatens to change the face
     of personal computing.  How can  the grass-roots shareware movement
     continue when corporations are planning to remove  DOS  from user's

     of   interest  to  the  general  user  group.    Recognition    and
     distribution  of  programs  and  software.    Each  and  every day,
     hundreds of  excellent  pieces  of  software  are  written  and its
     authors  are  trying    to   seek  the  most  opportune  means  for
     distribution.   Judy will  be  addressing  the  specific  topic  of
     "recognition of software by software  houses".    There  is  no set
     formula or procedure to have one's  finest  program  picked up by a
     major vendor in the industry, but there  are suggestions which Judy
     would  like to address which will open more  opportunities  to  the
     software programer than may have been available in the past.

     NEW VERSION OF PAKIT, A UTILITY FOR OMMM USERS
     (Plus a suggestion for Nodelist User Flag usage)

     A few  weeks ago, I placed an announcement about PAKIT in Fidonews.
     PAKIT has undergone a couple of revisions since then, however, with
     the main changes being  that  PAKIT  can  now  be  used  to  create
     outbound mail archives using the  ZOO  or  ZIP formats, if you have
     ZOO.EXE and/or PKZIP.EXE.  So, if you use oMMM and have a desire to
     use  better  compression  methods  when creating mail  packets  for
     certain  nodes  (and  you  know  those  nodes  are    capable    of
     uncompressing the mail archives you create for them), you  can  now
     use  just about any of the popular compression methods if  you  use
     PAKIT (more on that in a minute).

     The question arises, "If I am sending mail to a node  that  I don't
     normally  communicate with, how can I tell what types of compressed
     mail packets they are able to accept?" In fact, it would be nice to
     have this information  readily available for any node that we might
     wish to communicate with.

     A solution to that  problem  may  be at hand.  As many of you know,
     the Fidonet nodelist now allows  User-Defined flags.  It would seem
     to me that specifying that a  node  can  handle  various  types  of
     compressed mail packets would be a valid use for these flags, since
     a  substantial  amount  of connect time could be  saved  if  better
     compression methods were used between systems capable of doing  so.
     Unfortunately, different  sysops  have  different  ideas about what
     constitutes the "best" method of compression.  Some prefer to stick
     with the "Fidonet standard"  ARC  file  format.   Others prefer ZOO
     because no payment is requested  for  using ZOO (unfortunately, ZOO
     is  one  of  the  least  efficient  compression  methods  for  mail
     packets).  Yet others prefer PAK's "Crushing" method, which is much
     more  efficient,  especially on small .PKT files, while  some  have
     found  that  PKZIP provides the highest possible compression ratio.
     Some  systems  can  process  incoming mail packets in any of  these
     formats, while others can only handle one or two of them.

     Therefore, I propose that a user-defined flag be set aside for  the
     purpose  of defining types of compressed mail packets accepted by a
     node.  Something on the order of:

          Flag format:  UMC:x[x[x]]

     U indicates  a  User  Flag,  MC stands for "Method of Compression".
     The letters following the colon (which could be in any order) would
     include one or more of the following:

          C = unCrushing supported (PAK) - implies unSquashing &
              unCrunching also supported
          S = unSquashing supported (PKUNPAK, PKXARC, newer versions
              of ARCE) - implies unCrunching also supported
          N = unCrunching NOT supported (not valid with C or S)
          R = unReducing supported (PKUNZIP)
     FidoNews 6-16                Page 12                  17 Apr 1989


          Z = unZooing supported (ZOO)

     Limitations:

          C implies unSquashing and unCrunching, so C and S should
            NOT be used together

          N implies unCrunching NOT supported, therefore it's not
            valid in combination with either C or S (at least not
            when any existing software that I'm aware of is used,
            since anything that will unCrush or unSquash will also
            unCrunch).

     Samples:

     A node that uses  PAK,  ZOO,  and  PKUNZIP to process incoming mail
     packets would use the flag:

          UMC:CRZ

     A node (probably a non-MSDOS  node) that cannot process regular ARC
     style mail packets, but that CAN  handle  packets  compressed  with
     ZOO, would use the flag:

          UMC:NZ

     A node that uses ARC or an  older  version  of  ARCE  that does not
     support unSquashing, plus PKUNZIP to process incoming mail  packets
     would use:

          UMC:R

     (Note  that if the N flag is not used,  unCrunching  capability  is
     assumed).

     Now, the above is just a proposal.  At the  present  time, PAKIT is
     not  capable  of  directly  reading  the  nodelist  to  obtain this
     information.   However,  if  folks were to start using this type of
     notation (or if  the  FTSC  were to put their blessing on something
     like this), it would  make  it  worthwhile  to  rewrite PAKIT (or a
     similar  program)  to  go  directly    to  the  nodelist  for  this
     information, instead of using a separate  control  file.    End  of
     editorial comment.

     Now, back to PAKIT.  PAKIT is  a  free utility program intended for
     use with oMMM, although it may work with  other  mail  packers that
     call ARCA to create mail archives.  Just in  case  you  missed  the
     article of a few weeks back, here's the pertinent information again
     (slightly rewritten to be correct for the latest version):

     PAKIT Version 1.04 - a semi-intelligent ARCA to PAK/ZIP/ZOO
     Converter for use with oMMM.

     No warranty expressed or implied - use at your own risk!

     PAKIT  was  written  to  allow  you to create smaller outgoing mail
     FidoNews 6-16                Page 13                  17 Apr 1989


     archives  (*.mo?  files, etc.) for systems that can accept them, by
     using any  of  several  different file compression utility programs
     (PAK, ZOO, and/or PKWARE programs) with oMMM version 1.07 or higher
     (it will probably work  with  earlier versions of oMMM as well, but
     you should upgrade anyway!   Do  NOT use oMMM version 1.08, though,
     it was buggy).  Those who  use  oMMM  may  be aware that oMMM calls
     ARCA for file compression purposes.  PAKIT  intercepts  the call to
     ARCA,  translates  it  to  a format that another  file  compression
     utility  can  understand, and then hands it over to  that  utility.
     While PAKIT is specifically designed for use with oMMM, it MAY also
     work with other packers that call ARCA using the "/D" parameter  at
     the end of the invocation line.

     PAKIT was  originally  intended to be used with NoGate Consulting's
     PAK File Compression  Utility, and still defaults to the use of PAK
     (it now requires PAK  version  1.5 or higher), however you may also
     optionally specify that PKWARE's PKARC  or  PKPAK  program is to be
     called when creating "Crunched" or "Squashed"  mail archives (these
     programs  are no longer available from PKWARE,  but  may  still  be
     available on some BBS's).  You also have  the  option  of using ZIP
     ("Reducing") or ZOO as the compression method to be  used  for mail
     packets.

     If  you  use  this  program and PAK without a PAKIT.CTL  file,  the
     resulting mail archive files should be no different than if you had
     just  used ARCA only (obviously, there's no real advantage in doing
     that, but  you  can  do it if you want to).  The major advantage in
     using this program  is  that  you  can  use  a  control file called
     PAKIT.CTL,  which  will allow  you  to  specify  which  compression
     method, or which of PAK's  three  possible compression levels, will
     be used when packing mail to  any  given  node.   Thus, if you KNOW
     that  a  particular  node  is using PKWARE's  PKXARC  (or  PKUNPAK)
     program  to  de-archive mail packets, you can create  mail  packets
     using  "Squashing",  which  will  make smaller packets and possibly
     save you some transmission time.  If you regularly communicate with
     a  node that uses PAK to unpack mail, you can create  mail  bundles
     using "Crushing"  and  save  even  more disk space and transmission
     time.  And,  the  most  recent  versions of PAKIT will allow you to
     create compressed mail bundles  using  ZOO.EXE  or  PKWARE's  PKZIP
     program, should you have a  need  to  send  mail  bundles in one of
     those formats.  These options should  only  be used with nodes with
     which  you communicate regularly, and know what  program  is  being
     used to uncompress mail packets.

     The current version of PAKIT renames individual .PKT files prior to
     placing  them in the mail archive, in order to  assure  that  older
     files are always placed before newer ones in the archive.   This is
     done  to  overcome  a  difference  in  operation  between  ARCA and
     PKARC/PKPAK/PAK 1.0.    ARCA  always added packets to the END of an
     existing archive (as  does PAK 1.5+ if the "/O-" modifier is used),
     but some of the  newer programs do us the favor(?) of inserting new
     files into an existing archive in alphabetical order.  oMMM creates
     packets  using  a naming sequence that  restarts  every  day,  thus
     packets created just after midnight would be  stored in the archive
     BEFORE packets created on the previous day (when  one  of the newer
     archivers  is used).  The result is that replies  to  messages  are
     FidoNews 6-16                Page 14                  17 Apr 1989


     sometimes    stored   prior  to  the  original  messages  when  the
     destination system  unpacks  the  mail!  PAKIT attempts to overcome
     this problem by  renaming  the packets using a naming sequence that
     restarts at the beginning  of  every  year,  rather than every day.
     Thus, it is only possible  to  create  out-of-order mail packets at
     the beginning of January.  The  packet  names used contain only the
     hexadecimal  digits 0-9 and A-F, and are  always  eight  characters
     long (not counting the .PKT extension).  As far as I can determine,
     this will not cause any problem for any existing mail unpacker, but
     please let me know if you discover otherwise.

     Version  1.04  of  PAKIT has just been released, and is  compatible
     with the newer releases of oMMM (1.30 and higher).  Older  versions
     of  PAKIT (before 1.02) will most likely not work properly with the
     newer  versions  of  oMMM.  The most recent copy of PAKIT should be
     file  requestable  from  Fidonet  node  1:154/7  (aka  LCRnet  node
     77:1011/7 or NetWork  node  8:70/7),  under the filename PAKIT*.ZIP
     (at this writing, PAKIT104.ZIP  is the latest version).  1:154/7 is
     a mail-only node located in  Milwaukee,  and is PC Pursuitable.  If
     you are located in a PC  Pursuitable city and for some reason can't
     make a file request work, send me  a  message  and  I'll  try  file
     attaching it to you.  By the way,  there's  no  copyright notice or
     request for payment (or anything else) anywhere in PAKIT.    It's a
     gift to anyone who wants it, pure and simple!

     If  you  find  an archiving program that creates archives that  are
     even smaller  than  "Crushed"  or  "Reduced" files (particularly if
     it's truly public  domain,  or  at  least  free  to  non-commercial
     users), please send a copy of the program to me and I will at least
     consider making a version of  this program that will use it.  Also,
     if the Fidonet (or any "other"  net)  nodelist  is ever modified to
     include  a  "compression  level"  flag for mail  archives,  I  will
     consider  rewriting this program to look directly to  the  nodelist
     for compression level information.

     The Veterinarian's Corner
     Excerpts from the ANIMED GroupMail Conference

     by Don Thomson, 1:102/1005

     The feline leukemia virus is a contagious virus limited to
     members of the cat family. It recieved its name, because it is
     one of the types of virus' that have the ability to cause cancer
     of the white cells.

     The disease caused by the feline leukemia virus can take any
     number of forms. Because the virus attacks and suppresses the
     body's immune response, an increased suseptibility to infections
     of all types is commonly one of the first signs. Long standing
     'cold' symptoms, repeated abscesses, oral infections, an
     increased susceptibility to pneumonia, and other internal
     infections may occur.

     If the animal recovers from these types of opportunistic
     infections, the virus, hidden in the bone marrow and lymph nodes,
     begins to manifest itself. The feline leukemia virus (FeLV) has
     the ability to become intermingled with the DNA of the primitve,
     dividing bone marrow cells. This most commonly manifests itself
     as a severe 'aplastic' anemia. Occasionally cancer of the white
     cells of the bone marrow (leukocytes) may cause cancer of the
     while cells, hence the name 'leukemia' virus. More commonly the
     FeLV will cause cancer of the lymph nodes, similar to Hodgkins
     Disease of man.

          What can be done to prevent this disease?

     Because the virus is shed most heavily in the saliva, and to
     lessor extent in urine, feces, and tears, limiting 'community'
     food bowls from which stray cats of unknown status will decrease
     the spread of the virus. If your cat is an outdoor cat,
     vaccination is reccommended. The odds are quite high that your
     cat will be exposed to the virus as approximately 90% of outdoor
     The disease is most prevalent in multiple cat households, where
     repeated high-level exposure of virus allows the actual infection
     to overwhelm the cat's immune response. Most intermittant, low
     level exposures do not result in actual infection.  But if you
     have more than one cat, they should be tested for 'latent' or
     inapparent infection and vaccination.  If found to be negative,
     then they should be vaccinated. Strictly indoor cats, tested
     negative, probably don't require vaccination because this is a
     relative fragile virus, not long lived in the environment.

     There is no 'cure' for the disease once contracted other than
     supportive, symptomatic treatment. The best cure possible for
     this killer is prevention.

     More on cats:

     Cats are not just 'scaled down' versions of humans as far as how
     their bodies handle many medications!

        For example:

        1 Tylenol caplet can kill a cat, by causing the hemoglobin of
        the red blood cells to no longer be capable of oxygen binding
        and transport!  Sad sight....

        1 baby aspirin will last up to FOUR DAYS in the bloodstream of
        your cat.  Overdoses can and DO occur by well-meaning people,
        giving their pets human medications.

     PLEASE CHECK with a veterinarian BEFORE administering ANY
     medication to your cat.

     The following  is the first in a series of four columns Fred Grosby
     (a federal government  employee, and a user on "The Falcon's Rock")
     has written.  He  deserves  all  the  credit  for  writing them.  I
     suggested that he upload them  to  my  system,  because  I  enjoyed
     reading them in our local Mensa  newsletter, Capital M.  I hope you
     enjoy reading them, too.  The archive  of all four is available for
     file request from 1:109/501 as BSOUTH.ZIP.

     Notes From Bureaucracy South
     By Fred Grosby, a user on 1:109/501

     Well, they're at it again.  The Big  Program  is  reorganizing, for
     the third time in the six years that I have worked here.  It's sort
     of  like  a  biennial  celebration  of  the way things go  here  in
     Bureaucracy South.

     The  first  reorganization was in 1983, when The Big Program got  a
     new  head;    let's  call  him  Clark.    Clark,  being  thoroughly
     Reaganized, was Hell-bent to  cut  out all of the waste, fraud, and
     abuse  in  The  Big Program,  increase  efficiency,  and  save  you
     taxpayers a ton of money.   Besides,  he figured that if he saved a
     lot of money the administration would give  him  a  big cash award.
     So  he reorganized, saved a lot of money,  and  got  his  big  cash
     award.

     He also fragmented the operations of The Big Program  so badly that
     nobody  knew  who  was supposed to do what.  Our  regional  offices
     screamed  bloody  murder,  the  workers in The Big Program screamed
     bloody murder,  and our clients screamed bloody murder,but did that
     phase Clark?   Not  a  chance.  He knew what to do.  He reorganized
     again,  in  late  1985.        Ostensibly,   the  purpose  of  this
     reorganization was to straighten out  some  of the mess made by the
     first reorganization.  What it actually  did  was  to  take several
     smaller  offices and mash them together into  one  great  amorphous
     mass that was virtually impossible to manage.   It  also managed to
     (Surprise!)  save  some  more  money, which got Clark another  cash
     award.

     Now it's 1988.  Clark has taken his money and  moved on to head one
     of  our  regional  offices,  where  he  has  taken  on a new  task:
     destroying employee morale.   Clark's successor, whose name may not
     be mentioned here any  more,  got fired for reasons that have never
     been explained.  Personally, I  think  it was for spending his work
     time managing his stock portfolio instead  of The Big Program.  The
     current head of The Big Program is  a  nice  young fellow whom I'll
     call Steve.  Imagine, a senior executive at  age  30.  All you have
     to do is be good friends with The Assistant Secretary and you, too,
     can make it in Bureaucracy South.

     So here's Steve, who is no great shakes as a manager, trying to run
     this  gargantuan  mess  of  an  organization,  and  he's getting in
     trouble because  he  keeps  sending  The Administrator to the wrong
     people for things.    Fortunately,  fate  brought  Steve to The Big
     Program in late 1987, just in time for him to reorganize the place.
     There was a little problem,  though.  Steve's a political type;  he
     doesn't really know the nuts and  bolts  of  the  program that he's
     FidoNews 6-16                Page 18                  17 Apr 1989


     managing.  So, as much in self-defense  as anything else, he turned
     the job over to his assistant, Beverly.  Not only is Beverly one of
     my favorite people, she's also a fabulous manager.   She  has  also
     worked in The Big Program forever, and knows where all  the  bodies
     are  buried.    So  she analyzed, and discussed, and consulted, and
     came up  with  what  I  knew that she was going to come up with all
     along.  Yes,  folks,  we're putting it back the way it was in 1983,
     B.C.  (Before Clark).

     There was only one  problem:    explaining the cost increase to The
     Department, which  must  approve  the reorganization.  According to
     the official formula  mandated  by  The Department, we are about to
     spend an additional $83,000  per year of your tax money.  Actually,
     it's going to be more like $1.5 million, but who are we to tell The
     Department that their formula has a  flaw  in  it?   Either way, we
     figured that we were in for a fight.

     You know what?  The Department didn't  bat  an  eye.    There are a
     couple  of  technical  details  to work out, but  the  guy  at  The
     Department  who  handles  reorganizations  has  assured me that the
     reorganization  of  The Big Program will be approved.  He  told  me
     that as far as The Department is concerned, it's our budget, and if
     we  want  to  spend  the  money  on  our reorganization, that's our
     business.  And Reagan doesn't think that he's presiding over a lame
     duck administration.   If  we  would  have tried this six years ago
     they would have eaten our lunch.

     So, in a few  weeks  The  Big Program will be right back the way it
     started.  Offhand, you might  say  that  the only one who benefited
     from all the fuss and bother was Clark, who took the money and ran.
     There is, however, one other winner in  this  game:   me.  You see,
     I'm the one who processed the 1983 and  1985 reorganizations and is
     processing  this one.  Each reorganization takes, say, four  months
     to process.  Then there are all of the followup actions, the record
     keeping, and the reviews to do, by which time it's almost  time  to
     start thinking about the next reorganization.  Steve is a political
     appointee.  He will be gone by the end of the year, and what do you
     want to bet that his successor doesn't reorganize again?  And guess
     who'll be there to do  it?    This,  folks, is called job security,
     which is a whole lot more  important  to me than the few bucks that
     Clark got.

     No matter what they do to The Big Program, I win.  You have to take
     your victories where you find them here in Bureaucracy South.
