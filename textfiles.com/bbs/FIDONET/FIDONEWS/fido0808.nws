                             Let's Talk GURPS!

          Attention all role-players!  Zoo BBS in Clinton, TN would
     like to announce a new echo available for you.  Have you ever
     heard of the Generic Universal Role-Playing System?  It's a
     fantasic role-playing set-up from Steve Jackson Games in Austin,
     Texas.  As sucessful as the AD&D Echo has proven to be, we'd like
     to make a similar attempt with GURPS.  I realize it's not quite
     the "household word" that AD&D has become, but GURPS is growing,
     with over a million manuals in print.  If you're still not quite
     sure what I'm talking about, drop by your local hobby store and
     ask.  Or, even better, join up with the GURPS Echo and learn
     firsthand.

          To give a more complete explanation of GURPS, it's a much
     more complete system than most others.  It's very point based,
     and highly generic, allowing characters (and worlds) to be
     created with any era or concept in mind.  You can create the
     standard "AD&D" world, or perhaps a future world where magic
     works.  It really doesn't matter, and the rules work for all.

          In our echo we'll be discussing character creations, rule
     suggestions (as GURPS makes it simple to add new rules), and
     possible future additions to the game.  If this echo takes off,
     we may even launch a "play-by-echomail" adventure.   One of your
     moderators also happens to be a play-tester for Steve Jackson
     Games.

          So SysOps, ask your users - users beg your SysOps, and get
     the GURPS echo today.  For more information and distribution
     info, write me up at 1:3615/16.  I'll get you a feed node in no
     time.

     MACINTOSH ALTERNATIVE CONNECTIONS LIST (MACLIST) - UPDATE 2

     Ralph Merritt
     1:269/102, 1:269/111
     Tom Heffernan
     1:269/369

     February 21, 1991

     On October 27, 1989, a new, Macintosh oriented network was
     formed.  Named the 'Macintosh Alternative Connection List',
     MACLIST was established in Zone 6.

     The current MACLIST nodelist is available to all interested.
     Just file request (via Tabby WaZOO-style FREQ) 'MACLIST.ARC'
     from 1:269/369 or 1:269/102 [NOTE: DOS mailers please file-
     request from 1:269/111, a Front Door 2.00 mail-only node].

     Why was MACLIST formed?  There are several reasons we decided
     to form the Macintosh Alternative Connection List.  Here are
     some that inspired us to form MACLIST:

       o  The Macintosh is rapidly entering the world of computer
          networking.  Macintoshes are located in many different
          networks, but how to find them?  The MACLIST nodelist
          is a centralized source for you to communicate with
          other Macintoshes - simply compile the MACLIST nodelist!

       o  The Macintosh community has many unique aspects.  The
          MACLIST is a network for Mac sysops, and their users,
          to join together and address Macintosh issues that
          affect us all, examine the technology, discuss topics
          and disseminate information of interest to the
          Macintosh community.

       o  Need a Macintosh echo connection?  Files?  Looking for
          'Mac compatibility' (SEAlink transfer protocols and
          WaZOO FREQs)?  Check MACLIST for a system near you ...
          the Macintosh Alternative Connection, an independent
          network on the move.

     If you are running a Macintosh system, or a system dedicated
     to Macintosh users (the MACLIST is not necessarily composed
     100% of systems that are physically running on Macintoshes,
     but a member must have a system dedicated/oriented to the
     Macintosh user), and are interested in joining the MACLIST,
     please contact one of us at our addresses listed below!

     If you are interested in MACLIST, you might want to get a
     MACSYSOP feed to keep in touch with other Mac sysops.  In
     the summer of 1990, MACSYSOP was added to the "Fidonet
     Backbone", so it should be available in your local network.
     If it is not, please contact one of us below and we'll help
     you locate a source.  You do not have to carry MACSYSOP to
     be a member in MACLIST.

     Here are our answers to some of the questions we have been
     receiving:

     Q: Why did you chose Zone 6 for MACLIST?
     A: The Tabby mailer for the Macintosh does not have the
        capability to use two-digit zone addresses in it's current
        2.2 version. We therefore did not have a choice in Zone
        selection.  Zone 6 was the last remaining unoccupied single-
        digit Zone address at the time of MACLIST's formation.  After
        October of 1989, Fidonet split Asia off from Zone 3 and put
        it into Zone 6.  While we do not wish to intrude on another
        network's Zone or encounter the technical problems associated
        with a 'shared Zone', to date there is no Net/Node level
        addressing conflicts between MACLIST and Fidonet Zone 6.

        After Tabby 3.0 is released and is being generally used, we
        will move to another Zone as Tabby 3.0 supports zones up to
        32767.

     Q: What do I have to do to become a member of MACLIST?
     A: Run a BBS/system that caters to the Macintosh community
        and is accessable via some form of mailer that is FTSC
        compatible. It does NOT matter what hardware or software
        you use as long as you support the Mac.  Just send a
        message to one of us at the addresses listed below.

     Q: Is membership in MACLIST free?
     A: Yes.

     Q: If I do not join MACLIST will it be hard for me to get
        some Mac echoes?
     A: MACLIST does not have any echoes based in it. In other
        words NOT being a member of MACLIST will NEVER stop you
        from getting an echo.  We believe that the MACLIST will
        actually ASSIST you in finding systems that carry any or
        all of the MANY currently existing Macintosh echos.

     Q: Will I have to use my MACLIST node number?
     A: MACLIST is NOT a 'replacement' for other networks. You
        do not have to use your MACLIST node number as a primary
        node address. It does not have to even appear in your
        origin line.  As a matter of fact, you must have a
        "primary" address in some other network (such as Fidonet
        or Alternet) before joining MACLIST.  You might want to
        make MACLIST an AKA on your system.

     Q: Will joining this network cause problems for me in any
        other networks?
     A: It should not, as there have been software and hardware
        specific Networks for a long time with no problem, with
        participants in multiple networks.  DOS-based boards
     FidoNews 8-08                Page 4                   25 Feb 1991


        have been using nets like this all along (for example,
        PNET, QNET, RBBS-Net).  Each is means of communication
        and support for a particular interest group, just as
        MACLIST is oriented to the Macintosh community.

     Q: Why have you added the MACSYSOP echo to the "Fidonet
        Backbone" after so many months of successful distribution
        off the backbone?
     A: At the time MACLIST was formed in October of 1989, we chose
        the MACSYSOP Echo rather than some other echo because at
        the time MACSYSOP was not a Fidonet, Alternet (or any other
        net) echo.  After many requests by various Mac sysops, we
        placed it on the backbone to make it more available to those
        that wanted a link.

     Looking forward to bringing the MacIntosh community
     together,

                SaudiNet ... On the move and growing stronger!

                        By: Todd Looney 90:90/0  1:143/27
                            SaudiNet Zone Coordinator
                     and Tracy Graves 90:8022/200  1:159/500
                           "General All Around Good Guy"

     As many already know, in August of 1990 Mark Niswonger and Gary
     Lagier got together and initiated the beginnings of an idea to
     send public/private mail to the troops or servicemembers
     stationed in Saudi Arabia in "Operation Desert Shield" - now
     Desert Storm.

     The project called "The Saudi Connection" has evolved
     extraordinarily since then, and now involves collecting outgoing
     user mail with special addressing on it from over 1000 volunteer
     nodes throughout the country and forwarding it (echomail-style)
     through what has become known as the SaudiNet network boards to
     a central collection system.  At the collection site, the
     messages are viewed for decent content (racial slurs, profanity,
     etc.) to ensure that the system is not used improperly
     (requested by the Joint Chiefs).  Several times per week, the
     messages are sent to a PC User Group board (American sysop) in
     Saudi Arabia.  The members of the PC User Group print out the
     messages on a laser printer, fold them using an automatic
     folding machine, and hand deliver them to the Military Postal
     Service for delivery to troops in the field.  As you may have
     heard on the evening news, US Snail mail is taking an average of
     19 days to reach Saudi Arabia form the United States.  SaudiNet
     is now transmitting an average of 300 messages per day, and on
     our best day have delivered mail into military hands in as
     little as seven hours.

     Other organizations performing similar services have
     investigated our process and are now approaching us in order to
     gate their own messages to Saudi Arabia through our proven
     efficient and competent network.  The results of these new
     associations will triple our current volume of mail transmitted
     to Saudi Arabia.

     At first, the SaudiNet organization was clumsy. Many
     expectations and intentions were thwarted and many sysops quit
     before it got off the ground.  This has all been remedied and
     the system is flowing well; especially well for a virgin
     topology.

     One of the problems encountered was the inability of the
     coordinators to identify, with any accuracy, who the major
     players were on the team.  Since the system needed the support
     of the Pentagon and Central Command, it became necessary to
     create a temporary network for the purpose of management and
     identification.  SaudiNet was formed as a temporary network for
     this purpose.  As a security measure and to comply with the
     Electronic Communications Protection Act, it was agreed that
     none of this personal mail would travel through any systems that
     have not agreed to abide by the standards and methods of
     FidoNews 8-08                Page 6                   25 Feb 1991


     operation of SaudiNet.  Participating systems are simply asked
     to apply for a SaudiNet node number and to abide by the basic
     game plan.  SaudiNet coordinator do not require that
     participating systems actually use the Zone 90 AKA's if they or
     the systems they operate are not technically sophisticated
     enough to handle an alternate nodelist; coordinators merely need
     to have all participants listed in the SaudiNet nodelist for
     logistical purposes.

     In the process of this creation, a few Net Coordinators and Net
     Echo Coordinators have mistakenly taken the "other net" and "no
     Saudi Mail on the backbone" requirements as personal slights to
     their authority and have reacted according to that
     interpretation.  Sadly, a few other people that are actively
     opposed to the war have taken the stance that sending mail to a
     service person is equated to supporting the war.  These
     impressions are unfortunate, and could be no further from the
     truth.  As Vietnam veterans all over the country will all to
     readily attest, the troops in the field have nothing to do with
     formulating the policies of this country, they are merely tools
     abiding by an oath they made when entering military service.
     Vietnam veterans were ostracized upon their return from that
     unpopular war, and SaudiNet members throughout the country are
     dedicated to providing a method for American citizens to show
     their support of the troops of today who are serving with
     Operation Desert Storm in Saudi Arabia; and all are concerned
     about their morale and welfare.

     SaudiNet sysops are sharing the BBS network technology with the
     general community and have begun to receive high praise for
     their effort on CNN, the Associated Press, and newspapers across
     the country.  SaudiNet is not political in any way.

     We are taking the time to write this in hopes that we will
     remove any apprehensions and misunderstandings and gain the
     support of as many sysops as possible to help with this project.
     As former NC's, we can both understand any previous
     apprehensions ---- actually, before joining SaudiNet.  The
     SaudiNet coordinators personally speak with our Saudi Arabian
     receiving station, and the American sysops running it, on a
     regular basis to circumvent any potential problems and to check
     on the status of deliveries to the military postal
     organizations.  We have been in contact with U.S.  Military
     Central Command and are in contact with several U.S.  Senators
     who have investigated SaudiNet and found it to be worthy of
     their support.  We are satisfied that it is working well.

     Becoming a participating member in SaudiNet is easy.  The "Saudi
     Connection" calls for the installation of two echo areas:

          SAUDI ......... Private-User Mail Outbound-only.
     FidoNews 8-08                Page 7                   25 Feb 1991


          SAUDI_INFO .... SaudiNet Sysop Help (2 way).

     Messages may be imported by sysops from manual sources....  mail
     may be sent to specific personnel or to "ANY SERVICE MEMBER" for
     those souls who may not be receiving mail.

     There is a DOOR program that helps pre-address the messages and
     saves them into several message formats - SNETDOOR (magic word)
     is available for Freq at 1:143/27 (HST) 24-hours per day.  It is
     compatible with all .MSG format BBS operating systems, and with
     QuickBBS and RemoteAccess (and now even a kluge for WildCat).
     Another program is being developed as we speak for use with TBBS
     systems.  This program helps users to enter mail without a sysop
     needing to make any major changes to the board - only the
     echomail processor configuration needs to be modified to add the
     areas.

     We eagerly encourage all to consider offering this service to
     their users.  We invite you to read the documentation on the
     project and would be pleased to add you to the membership roles.
     The latest SaudiNet Nodelist is always available for Freq at
     1:143/27 as SNETLIST, which can be used to locate the nearest
     SaudiNet *C in your area where you need to submit your
     membership application.  An informational packet called
     SAUDI.ZIP contains the application, and some sample press
     releases for system operators who wish to solicit the aid of
     local media to help make the general public in your area aware
     of the SaudiNet services available to them at no charge.

     SaudiNet is currently in the process of incorporating as a
     charitable organization, and in that light now have an active
     Board of Directors including Legal, Publicity, and Technical
     Directors.  Although we are currently being availed the services
     of several 800 lines for our *C's, privately funded by the
     Association for Electronic Communications in return for
     receiving mail from their organization membership and
     transmitting them to Saudi Arabia, we are in the process of
     installing our own so that the general member node can be spared
     the cost of polling long distance for the SaudiNet echo's.

     In short, SaudiNet is ON THE MOVE and GROWING STRONGER!

     Thank you...

       It has been fourteen years since we met Luke,  Ben, Han and the
     others.  Eleven years since we  learned that Luke and Vader might
     actually be related,  and eight years since we saw the  Rebellion
     throw  off the cloak of tyranny that the evil Galactic Empire had
     brought to bear throughout the galaxy.

       Currently, there are at least two seperate conferences  devoted
     to the  other "Star" in the universe... Star Trek.  While  I have
     nothing against  the thousands of  fans that have used  the echos
     devoted to that property,  I believe there to be at least as many
     fans of the space-saga  trilogy created by George Lucas that have
     not had a  place to adequatley explore the worlds set before them
     in the STAR WARS movies.

       Since its  introduction  to the world in 1977,  there have been
     two more movies, several books, hundreds  of comics, thousands of
     games and figures... and most recently, and probably the greatest
     source of new information regarding that galaxy far, far, away...
     West End Games', Star Wars Role Playing Game.  This in itself has
     opened up HUGE avenues of new information that all Star Wars fans
     have been yearning for.

       There have been discussions that have started up on conferences
     like Film  and Comic Books  that have  eventually  been supressed
     because they started  going off onto tangents that did not relate
     to the conference they were being discussed on.  From the movies,
     to the comics, to the role playing games... I am hopeful that the
     Star Wars Conference will be a place  where all fans  can come to
     talk  about whatever  is on their mind  regarding their  favorite
     topic.

       The Star Wars  echo is now available  via private  distribution
     only.  Contact me  or  Bill McCauley  at Fidonet  1:161/42 on The
     Records  Department in Pleasanton (415-426-0470), California for
     more information and a connection to this new echo.

     May the Force be with you...

              YAPPPII (Yet another packet proposal - part 2)

          As we see graphics, image data, and digital voice quickly
     becoming more and more of life, and computers certainly not
     losing ground, careful analysis is needed to not drop nor be
     outdated, while keeping accessability and the free interchange
     of information.

          Most implementers agree that the ^a Kludge lines have
     very much served a purpose, but can be rather difficult to
     keep track of.  To continue adding more tends to reduce rather
     than assist compatibility.

          In the table below, is a proposal from Total System
     Software for Attribute flagging, which covers a fairly wide
     variety of needs, from the BBS mail user interface, to the
     networking of involved and varied data types.

         Type4Attribute   =  A named set of 32 bits,
                  starting at the bit value 2^0, through 2^31
                  with bits and bytes addressed in Intel format.

     Note that the actual disposition of a PACKET bearing the above
     flags, or of an individual (or multi-) message bearing the same
     flags have slight variations, but the meaning remains very
     close.

     SuspectedDuplicate is set for a packet by the SENDER when a mail
     transfer is aborted in mid-packet, without altering the timestamp
     and file length of the packet file.  RESUME transmissions will
     avoid transmitting this bit, but re-starts at offset zero will
     properly flag the possibly duplicated data.  For the individual
     message, SuspectedDuplicate allows an alternative to presumed
     delete, ignore duplicates and toss somewhere else options while
     not losing the fact that the message is thought to be a dup.

     A message with CompressedContent = 1, and MultiFormat = 1, will
     indicate that this is a `tick'ed file with description.  Other
     information in the header and in the data itself will indicate
     CompressedContent by itself or with only text or a Binary con-
     tent flag shows the content to be a compressed file with NO
     plain cover message.  When the header is used with a packet,
     it indicates that the entire packet is compressed, and the
     balance of the file must be acted upon similarly to the way
     ARCmail is currently treated.  De-compression is required only
     at any node for which it is not pass-through-only.  This bit
     is the ONLY difference between compressed mail and uncompressed
     .PKT mail packets of type 4 and 5.

     A truth table of the bits in each group above will allow the
     proper handling (or discarding where a basic incompatibility
     exists) from the message header, as software is enabled to
     accept the advanced features made available.

     Next time, the header formats which these bits help identify.

                           LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
     =================================================================

     This is in response to Kristian Stark's article about adding a flag to
     the nodelist for mail compression method.

     There was considerable discussion on this subject in the FTSC echo
     some time back.  We came to this conclusion:  Since picking up
     EchoMail from a node always requires some setup and communication
     between the sysops about such things as which echos, passwords,
     polling times, etc. it makes sense to also talk about the compression
     method to be used (if any).

     Typically, few people compress plain NetMail and generally since there
     is little advantage to compress one or two smallish NetMail messages
     anyway, there is generally no need for the overhead of a mail
     compression flag.

     Anyway, the idea for a compression type flag for the NodeList was
     tabled, at least for the time being.

     FidoNet 2:256/50

     After using various bulletin board softwares and mailers, I have
     finally settled with D'Bridge and Remote Access.

     Ever since I first got into computer communications I have felt
     I should do more than just run a bulletin board. I am really
     interested in online games etc. Not being a programmer I would
     like to offer my services as a tester/distribution site for new
     programs.

     If there are any authors who would like a UK tester/distribution
     site then I would like to here from you. I can be contacted via
     netmail to 2:256/50, 2:256/51 or direct on my board, Twin Peaks
     on +44-482-872294

     I await your replies...      Richard Brumpton.
