    There seems to have been a problem over the last few weeks
with my internet mail.  While all has now been fixed, there
appears to have been mail lost.  Fidonet stuff has been coming
in just fine <G>.  Anyway, if anybody has sent stuff to here via
the internet, and it appears to have been ignored, please send
it again.

    There have been a lot of articles over the last few weeks
extolling the virtues of fidonet over the internet.  Chief
amoung these is that fidonet echoes are better run, and often
more mature than the internet echos.

    I like fidonet, and prefer it to the usenet groups, as a
general rule.  The echoes are smaller and more personal.  I
find, with fidonet, that I get to know the people in an echo.
It is a much more personal place than the internet.

    However, that does not mean that fidonet is technically
healthy.  It does not really aleviate the problem that I brought
up in the editorial that started all this.  We are working with
software that is outdated, and little is being done to replace
it.  Most of the new communications software is not being
written for FTSC compliant messaging.

    As well, we are losing the advantages offered by the plethora
of new common carriers around.  We need to start taking
advantage of new technology and new software if we want to stay
around.  That problem exists, whether we like the net or not.

SHAREWRE Echo Moderator Changes
By: Kent Anderson, 1:382/1201
       Kand@onr.com

Rules changed and Relaxed

In August 1995, I effected a non-hostile takeover of the Fidonet echo,
SHAREWRE, when I could not contact the former Moderator. The echo was
on the verge of losing its backbone status for not filing the required
Moderator Update to the Elist. The former Moderator still made no
appearance, and the rules were revamped to remove some of the
restrictions instigated by that Moderator. A little background here:

I was the third Moderator of the echo, and was appointed by Moderator
Steve Shapiro when he moved to Boston, Ma. After a couple of years, I
burned out, and appointed Lee Jackson, my Co-Moderator. Lee did a
commendable job, but at the end of a year, had health problems as well
as moving to a new job in a different city. I accepted a temporary
assignment for the time it took to organize and complete an election
of a new Moderator. Maryjane Choate, of Houston, Tx won the election.

Maryjane took over at a very bad time, as the echo was suffering from
open warfare among some of its participants, and from many off topic
FidoNews 13-14                 Page:  3                    01 Apr 1996

postings from those seeking advice on cheating at or discussing how to
play various games. In an effort to control this traffic, she made
some very stringent amendments to rules. Included was a rule to reduce
the amount of space to be taken up by an author making announcement of
new or upgraded products. This is in no way a reflection upon
Maryjane's efforts. She did this during a period of bad health and
outside distractions, and, overall, did a commendable job with the
echo. Many participants, however, disagreed with her, and traffic in
the echo dropped from more than one hundred messages a day to around
twenty-five or so. A competing echo was formed to appeal to those who
were disgruntled.

Shortly after I took back over in August 1995, I did a rewrite of the
rules and relaxed most of the more stringent rules on authors'
submissions, as well as softening the tone of others. My approach is
to handle rules violations as gently as the situation permits, and if
I have a problem with someone's submission, to negotiate something
acceptable to both sides. My "hardnose" moderating is done by netmail,
but I am visible in the echo on the more gentle admonitions.

Traffic is growing, but I still miss many of the people who were once
regulars in the conference, This is an open invitation to you to come
back and take a look. If you like what you see, stick around, and let
me know what you think of the new look by netmail or Email.

FidoNet on the Internet

With my recent acquirement of an Internet account, I set out for looking
for where I could get FidoNet echomail and other services over the
Internet.  I was amazed at the amount of FidoNet material available on
the Internet, but I have yet to find what I want.

Call me picky, but listen close.  I am long distance from _ALL_ other
BBS's.  The only local service is my Internet provider.  I have in the
past gotten all my echomail and filebone materials for _FREE_ (from
normal charges) sites, such as some of the echomail stars.  This has
cost me quite a bit.  As such I can't currently maintain a very active
connection with FidoNet.  When I started searching on the Internet for
an echomail and filebone feed, I did _NOT_ expect to pay more for
internet service than I do for my long distance to get my currently
dwindling FidoNet mail packets.  However, that's all I can find.  Sure,
the services look neat and all, but get real.  First of all, this is a
hobby, and while a hobby isn't free, I really hate to see people living
off a hobby in that sense.

I imagine someone looking for a full feed could get by cheap with these
services, but I only gain to lose!  Not to mention, I wanted to mention
a couple other things that these services are doing, that you may not be
FidoNews 13-14                 Page:  4                    01 Apr 1996

aware of.  Call this a public service announcement.  I won't mention any
names, you can use the Internet to figure out who I am talking about...
Just don't be suckered into these services until you have exhausted
other possibilities.

Among echomail, one of these services is also offering a few other
items, most specifically for FidoNet SysOps.  While most of us do not
need these services, a few of you may, but before you think these
services are so nifty and fork out more money for them, make sure you
aren't already getting them for FREE!

One of the services is USENET NEWS.  While some consider USENET NEWS to
be better than FidoNet, I think that FidoNet is not only ahead of
USENET, but far superior to USENET NEWS.  However, many boards use
USENET news to attract subscribers.  I have two comments on this.  If
you are a user, and a potential subscriber to such a BBS, go get your
self an Internet account if possible.  If you are a SysOp, and USENET
news is expensive, why carry it?  Well, this one provider is offering
USENET news as a service.  The only service they are actually providing
is the conversion to FTN compatible format and back.  USENET NEWS
servers are often included in your Internet Account, and you just have
to know how to make it useful for you.  Look around.  There is a lot of
software out there to do this for your through your service providers
USENET NEWS server.  Of course it might not be cheap, but its cost is
likely to be far less that what you might pay for a couple years feed of
USENET NEWS already converted to FTN formats...

The same provider is offering another service.  Again, this service is
both ridiculous to me, and available else where for nothing.  The
service is weather maps.  Enough weather maps to fill a gig hard drive
in a few days!  That's one reason I think weather maps are crazy to be
posting for your callers.  You couldn't keep them up to date with the
way the service works.  I however suggest going to text based weather
forecasts and current conditions route, which is generally free if you
can find cheap software to do this.  The service exists all over the
Internet, so even if there is not a lot of software out there, there may
be other alternatives.  However, if you really feel weather maps are
what you want, then try finding them for FREE!  The provider providing
the service to FidoNet SysOps more than likely receives their copy for
FREE!  I know I have ran across quite a few sites on the Internet
offering free maps.

With this all aside, I have decided I want a chance to take part in some
of this.  So, I am asking, if any one is interested in an alternative
transport method over the Internet for FidoNet echomail and filebone
materials?  I am planning of offering a SMALL feed of mail and files
from my Windows 95 BBS setup.  The service will require, for the most
part, Windows 95, and a little manual time on your part.  If your
interested, give me an email and I'll let you know what I have come up
with.

While I am on the subject...  I want to attempt something else that is
rare, or at least I haven't found much of it(feel free to email me with
some details!)  I want to test the limits of B.R.E. and F.E. over the
Internet.  Any interested party who would like to join my 391 leagues,
FidoNews 13-14                 Page:  5                    01 Apr 1996

please write me.  Currently, Windows 95 SysOps will have the easiest
access to these leagues, but email access is possible, and so might be a
couple other methods.  I will try to accommodate any method of Internet
game data distribution that is both reliable and economical...

Monthly Gateway Info posting (UPDATED!)
Wes Mills (1:124/2342)

FidoNet<->Internet Gateway at 1:124/2342.999 and alt.bighub.org
----------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to the Fidonet-Internet gateway run by Wes Mills!
I offer FidoNet and Internet members the opportunity to transfer mail
between these two networks.

Seeing as how the current default gateway is going down, and over 90% of
FidoNet will be without Internet e-mail service, we feel that it is time
for someone new to step in to take over this service.

Table of Contents:
1) Rules of the gateway
2) How to use the gateway
3) Top 10 ways to get banned
4) Contact information
5) Ways to bypass these rules
6) SPECIAL INFORMATION ABOUT THIS GATEWAY

---------------

1) Rules of the gateway

By learning from the mistakes  and  mishaps  of  the  former  default
gateway, we have put in this set of rules:

        1) DO NOT, FOR ANY REASON, AT ANY TIME ATTEMPT TO BYPASS THE BANNED
           ADDRESSES ON THIS GATEWAY.
        2) Subscribing to any mailing lists is prohibited.
        3) Exchanging of files is prohibited.
 *       4) No mail is private.
        5) Mail to *.z1.fidonet.org will be banned.
        6) Please report any problems you experience.

 *  This  should  be  taken as: I have no control over who reads your
mail before it gets to my system and after it leaves.   You  may  use
PGP or any other encryption all you like.

2) How to use the gateway

You may address e-mail from the Internet in two different ways:
FidoNews 13-14                 Page:  6                    01 Apr 1996


STANDARD:
   <name>%p##.f####.n###.z#@alt.bighub.org

FEWER KEYS METHOD:
   <name>%z-nnn-ffff-p@alt.bighub.org

Examples:
  STANDARD:
    wes.mills%p4.f2342.n124.z1@alt.bighub.org
  FEWER KEYS:
    wes.mills%1-124-2342-4@alt.bighub.org

For sending from Fidonet to the Internet:

Use their regular e-mail address, but, for the node number, put
1:124/2342.999

OR>>>For the benefit of those used to the other method:

Address  the  message  to  UUCP @ 1:124/2342.999 and put, on the very
first blank like of the message:

TO:

followed by the Internet address.  Press <ENTER>  or  <RETURN>  three
times and type your message.

3) Top 10 ways to get banned

        10) Subscribing to any mailing lists.
         9) Trading any files (any encoding method).
         8) Assuming mail is private and treating it that way.
         7) Harassing users via this gateway.
         6) Attempting to overload our pretty overloaded system.
         5) Moving massive amounts of unnecessary mail.
         4) Attempting to mis-direct other people's mail.
         3) Forging messages.
         2) Distributing illegal material.

         AND, THE #1 WAY TO GET BANNED:

         1) ANNOYING THE POSTMASTERS.

4) Contact Information

5) Ways to bypass these rules

I'd  like  everyone  to  know  that  none of these rules are hard and
static. Exceptions can be granted to everyone of them,  assuming  the
request  is  reasonable.  If you feel you have a need to do something
not  permitted  by  these  rules,  and  can  present  that   argument
reasonably  (i.e.  not "because you feel like it"), please contact me
and we'll work something out.

postmaster@alt.bighub.org

6) SPECIAL INFORMATION ABOUT THIS GATEWAY

For this month's posting, I have something new to report: Because  of
our  "wonderful"  telephone  company, the gate won't have ISDN access
for about the next 6 months or so.  This is  reportedly  due  to  the
fact  that  Texas Instruments is taking up all the ISDN switches, and
GTE isn't going to install any more until the ESS system is upgraded.
(darnit)

Also,  thanks  to the users who have obeyed the rules.  Anyone notice
that this is section 6 this time?  Be sure to read section 5.

And, finally, a few clarifications:

The exchanging of files restriction is in place for one reason, and one
reason O_N_L_Y:

        When Netscape 1.2 came out, I still had the ftpmail addresses
        enabled.  47 users requested the 2MB file, via MY GATEWAY, and
        my 14.4k connection.  Since the messages are split into 500
        lines each to make it easier on FidoNet routing, that resulted
        in some 1200 messages.  That's a lot of hard disk space, folks,
        and I cannot support that amount of traffic at one time.  I'm
        upgrading my hard disk to a 2GB disk, so the restriction may
        be lifted soon.

That Gateway Thingie?

Hey, ho, welcome and all that jaZz :)  Thought I would pop in and have
a word or two and both entertain myself and enlighten a few peeps whilst
I was at it!     I've   read   the   last   few   or   four   copies  of
fido_enlightenment_(in)digest(ion) over here and thought I would throw
in my invaluable <hush> comments since I've been up for thirty hours and
have nothing better to do at five in the afternoon.  I've come to
realize that you guys created this sucker for my sole entertainment when
nothing inTeReStinG is going on in DFW or DFW_SALE (Hi Bill!!!;) and
thought I'd voice my thanks. <gee, what a pompus...Ahem..>
Anyways, to the few points:

>bighub.org
>C I A (1:2623/71)
>Greetings Wes!
>
>I just wanted to write and speak my view of your altruistic gateway
>service, as stated in this weeks fidonews:
>
>By learning from the mistakes and mishaps of the former default
>gateway, we have put in this set of rules:
>
>1) DO NOT, FOR ANY REASON, AT ANY TIME ATTEMPT TO BYPASS THE
>BANNED ADDRESSES ON THIS GATEWAY.

...hrm.. didn't know there were any banned addresses on the gateway!
>
>2) Subscribing to any mailing lists is prohibited.

...gee, I do!  ...have been for quite a while over here actually,
funny, Gary even reminded me to cancel and resubscribe when he
changed servers.. hmm.. now while I could understand him getting
upset for BIG and Numerous lists that bogged the system down
I don't recall this rule..

>3) Exchanging of files is prohibited.

Hrm, don't recall that one either..

>4) No mail is private.

Now that's just plain SILLY, my mail is as public or private
as I care to make it.  Gary doesn't even SEE the Inet mail
coming and going unless he is doing maint. and I don't know
why I couldn't encrypt it anyways. <sigh>

>These are the same rules that caused Burt Juda such strife and

>protection afforded by ECPA in regards to private mail..  I infer
>from your prohibition that PGP mail will be auto-deleted, also?

...deleting stuff?  phtbff!

>As I told Burt in the Snews a few weeks ago, these rules are anal
>and hamper communication...

...there you go again, What Rules?  I don't Recall ANY...

>I admire your effort in offering the gateway, but, what use is it?
>You don't even grant  respect for private mail..

...covered above :>

>Since you will not allow files or mailing lists, its just as

..also covered above :)

>It's trivial to get around those twit filters from the Internet,
>you are aware of that?

...there are NO twit filters or banned sites :)

>Sigh...

>Why is it necessary to forbid mailing lists, when your downlinks

>to keep people YOU don't like from using your supposedly open

...now, ahem... did I mention that there IS NO bighub.org ??
Well ok, there is a bighub.org, but it certainly isn't linked
to 2342. or 2342.99 or .999 so I have no idea how your
incoming mail is going to get to.
...yep, that's right.  Seems Mr. Wes decided to come in here,
blab for a while, post his own Rules <rolling eyes> and create
his OWN Gate without bothering to ask Gary first if he could
use his system.  <see, and you thought *I* was uppety;>
Here's what happened:

      <<<IN SURROUND SOUND ORGASM!!>>> {where available}

...so I'm sitting here at the house reading this sucker and
see Gary's node number, but the sucker has a .999 attached to
the end of it. 'Hrm, that's strange, must be a typo, should
be .99 to send the imail out.'  Then I read a bit further and
start to get ticked, I mean first this rules crap, then to top
it off nobody told the co-sysop about this bighub thingie??

Next day I go to work, walk in and Gary is busy doing his
FidoNews 13-14                 Page: 11                    01 Apr 1996

work stuff, I walk up, 'Gary, whats up with the I-Net Gateway?'
'What do you mean what's up?' ' I mean what's up with this
bighub.org and these stupid rules??' <his eyes get Really
Wide> <sheesh, that was priceless;>  'What do you mean??' says
he.  'You know, that crap in the Fido News, whats up with
all those rules and stuff and why is Wes posting .999 instead
of .99 and why is HE posting this stuff instead of you?
You've read it, haven't you?' <his eyes furrow> 'No, but I
will in the morning.'  Needless to say he wasn't pleased,
heh.

Doesn't make sense why Wes would want to try and set something
up that's allready there.. hmm... <well, setting aside the
fact that he talked to everyone about it except the person who
everything would be going through;>

BUT in case you were wondering about the mail you might have
been sending?  ...weel, if you've been sending it to .999 it
has been going out, but return mail has prolly been bounced
due to the fact that nobody KNEW about it coming in.

Anyways I discussed things with Gary and here's what he said:

>Ok the return address will be user.name@zone-net-node-
>point.tmb.org. All mail send to 1:124/2342.99 or
>1:124/2342.999 will be sent out. All incoming mail will be
>routed unless other arrangements are made.
(you don't have to put 0 in if your not a point)

If your local then your incoming mail will most likely
go straight to you, if your LD it will be routed netmail.
<the phone bills are allready outrageous>

Oh and read 'Social Constipation', ROFLMAO :)
...and since I'm here: (Death of Fido??)

Seems that everyone and their sister is commenting on the 'Death'
and all that jazz, I've read a lot of different opinions but
concluded that *I* <halo and appropriate music;> have the real
answer, heh.  You see Fido is being forgotten.  Period.  No really,
go down to your local computer store or whatever and start asking
people if they have a modem and where they call with it.  More
times than not your going to here something like Compuserve,
America Online, or one of the many NeW I-Net servers that are
popping up out of the woodwork.  See, most people have never even
HEARD of a BBS.  Really.  ...and if they have it's usually something
bad.  Fido?  They never got that far.  With all these other services
out there the local BBS never had a chance due to bad press for
the BBS, massive advertising for the Big Guys and so forth.  The
ONLY newbies are the ones we bring in Ourselves.
Spread the WorD. (yes, I realize this was just covered, but since
(since I had allready typed it before I got the newNews...:)

Yet more suggestions to enhance Fido
By Louie Gonsalves 1:3604/43
louie.gonsalves@phosphor.datasync.com

Hi there.  I got another suggestion to enhance Fidonet (from the
user's perspective)...  these may seem a bit straining on the sysop's
side, though... but sometimes sacrifices must be made to benefit the
whole, not the few.

Here goes:

1.  Several othernets have a mandatory general chat echo that all
    systems must carry.  In Fido, it could be INTERUSER.  A
    mandatory chat echo would give users a "default" echo to start
    Fido with.  I've seen users get flustered with posting off-topic
    messages in all sorts of echoes.  I usually try to educate
    newbies on Fido etiquette, but sometimes...

2.  Routed netmail for all nodes, regardless of Zone.  I know this
    topic has been beat to death in the past, but it's a feature that
    would greatly enhance service to users.  Once routed netmail has
    been established for all nodes, then perhaps sysops will start
    offering read/write access to users.  And if the users are happy,
    the sysops are happy... and if sysops are happy, then Fido, as a
    whole, is happy.

That's all for this issue...
