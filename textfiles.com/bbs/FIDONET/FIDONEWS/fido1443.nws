     Besides the U.S. and parts of Europe, are there comparable festivals
     of ghosts and spirits and the dead in the rest of FidoNet? This is the
     Halloween Issue, so I just thought I'd ask. [grin]

     A mixed bag this week. Nothing about premature blizzards or leaves
     changing colors.

     Somebody sent me an 867K .ART file this week containing rambling
     excerpts from various Echomail areas, it appears. They pretended to be
     somebody else when they sent it but even if they'd been honest in the
     connect, even I draw the line at 867K for publishing or reading. I
     don't know what the purpose was but it contained several messages
     marked Confidential up front. Such traffic is not to be reproduced
     without permission according to FidoNet Policy. I didn't save it or
     the log containing the sending info but somebody has too much time on
     their hands. It wasn't worth reading. If it happens again, I'll be
     running a trace and saving the incoming info.

     The Marlins are getting ready to win the World Series the hard way in
     a seventh game. The World Series gets around the world, doesn't it?

     IP Fido Nodes Request
     by Zorch Frezberg, 1:205/1701

     I'm developing a proposal for the inclusion of FidoNet Technical
     Standards compatible nodes operating mailers, which are located on the
     InterNet within Zone 1.

     To achieve this, I need to gather information from Zone 1 sysops that
     isn't available anywhere else I've been able to find.

     For the purposes of this proposal, I must define key provisions that
     must be met for inclusion in this effort.  These are:

        1) The node must be operating a normal node, which is identified in
           the regular FidoNet Nodelist;

        2) The normal node must not be a PVT node or Point System, and must
           be CM (CrashMail) capable;

        3) The node located on the InterNet must have a 'static IP' address
           and be available during a specified time for connections;

        4) The InterNet node must be accessible through a mailer front-end
           which accepts FTN/FTS-0001 standard connections.

     If you are running such a node, please forward the standard
     information:

          1) Your normal FidoNet nodelist entry, with flags.

          2) The city and state where your system is located.

          3) The static IP address to be used when contacting
             your system.

          4) The node number, if different from above, assigned
             to the IP-based mailer.

          5) Your hours of operation for netmail and/or files.
             Any BBS information is optional.

          6) The type of connection you support (VMODEM, telnet, BinkP,
             etc.).

          7) The type of front-end mailer software you are using.

          8) Any specialized nodelist flags you feel should be included.
             (NOTE: Inclusion of such flags with your submission does not
             guarantee that these will be included in the final proposal,
             though reasonable and useful flags will be catalogued as
             well.)

     FIDONEWS 14-43               Page 5                   27 Oct 1997


     For a variety of reasons relating to the proposal, this listing must
     be limited to Zone 1 nodes only at this time.  I am willing to share
     the information with other Zones, and exchange lists as well, once the
     information has been processed and submitted with the proposal.

     Please forward the above information, or any compiled lists for Zone 1
     which you may have (any format) to me at 1:205/1701 or by E-Mail to:
     zorch@kumr.lns.com.

     Thank you for your assistance, and let's find out what's out there!

     A BBS Story
     Gregg Jennings, 1:331/109

     After meeting at Coffee Obsession, the new trendy coffee shop, which
     they rated an excellent quiet place for two old friends to get
     together to discuss old times, Pat and John inevitably ended up
     talking about computers.
          Old-timers, equipmentwise, after complaining about Windows 95,
     and speculating about Linux, John had mentioned that he had gotten a
     hold of an archive of a type he had not heard of.
          "That damn ZAR program!" Pat laughed.
          Seeing the quizzical expression on his friend's face Pat went on
     to explain. "This BBS I hang out at called it that when he first got
     it. He prefers using LZX and I guess felt bugged by having to make
     available yet another archiving program. ZAR is actually pretty good.
     It has menu based interface for viewing archives of most types as well
     as a command line interface. And although it does produce smaller
     archives, something related to solid archives where it concatenates
     files before compressing, it's native format has not caught on too
     well."
          "Interesting," John said. "Kind of like a compressed TAR
     archive."
          "The so called solid archive feature, yes. But as far as I know
     it's only DOS based."
          And so they discussed various pros and cons of compression
     techniques and interfaces. John asked Pat, who was more of a
     programmer than he, if he had a copy of this infamous ZAR program.
          "Gee," Pat grinned, patting his pockets, "Not on me." At John's
     groan Pat said, "No, I don't think I have it anywhere, but that BBS
     does. You can get it from there."
          "What's the number? Is it local?"
          "Yeah. Just remind me an I'll give it to you before I go." Pat
     told him.
          "How 'bout if you come by my place after this," John said.  "I
     haven't called a BBS in a while."
          "Sure," Pat said and then finished his coffee. "Why not now?"

          After John's trusty old 486 booted up John started his
     communications program.
          "Wow! FidoTerm huh? Where'd you dig that up?" Pat asked.
          "Someone from work gave it to me a long time ago," John said.
     FIDONEWS 14-43               Page 6                   27 Oct 1997


     "Requires a FOSSIL driver but it works quite well. Good enough
     anyway."
          Taking the seat before the computer Pat asked, "Do you ever read
     any FidoNet stuff?"
          "No," was John's quick reply.
          "You should check it out. There's a lot of jerks, but hey, you
     find them everywhere. Check out this BBS." He sat back while the modem
     chirped away. He entered his login name and password.  "It's actually
     pretty good," he was saying when there came a click and the modem hung
     up.
          "Eh?" Pat said turning to the screen. "What's this?"
          "'Phone number does not match your entry,'" John read. "'If you
     have any problems, please call back and login as HELP.'" "Damn!" Pat
     said. "What the heck is that all about?"
          "Must be caller ID," John said.
          "Must be," Pat said and re-entered the number. "I'll just turn it
     off this time."
          Chirp, chirp, click went the modem.
          "'Non-caller ID calls are unaccepted,'" Pat read this time.  "O,
          fer crying out loud," John said. "What the..."
          "How about calling back as HELP?" Pat asked.
          "But that's not going to do you any good if I can't get access,"
     John said. "I know. Why don't you call and set up a new account?"
          "Okay," Pat said and took over the seat. When connected he
     entered his name and chose a password.
          "Capture the text," John said. "If I recall correctly there are a
     few screens full of rules."
          "Already did that," Pat informed him, hitting the return key
     several times. "Here we go. Blah, blah, blah... 'You have read-only
     access to the new user's forum only until you are validated.' What
     the...?"
          "Strange," John said. "I don't remember that. Try accessing the
     filesbase anyway."
          "How do I do that?"
          "Type files."
          "Okay," Pat said. After hitting return he read, "'Files access
     denied.'"
          "Crap!" John said. "I could have sworn I got access when I first
     called."
          "When was that?"
          "Couple of years ago."
          "Well," Pat said. "Things change I guess."
          "I'll say," John said. "Well, it looks like I can't get you that
     program unless you want to come over to my place and I call from
     there. Man, I can't believe this."
          "Well, it can wait I guess," Pat sighed. "It was only a game
     archive that I had."
          "But that's not the point. I should be able to get this.  Hold
     on. Look. Log off. I got a friend who lives nearby. I'll call him."

          Putting down the receiver John turned slowly to his friend.  "He
     says that you should just get an Internet account. You can find
     anything you need there without questions. Get into the 20th century
     he said."
          "Gee. Can I get it tonight?" Pat asked sarcastically.
          "Really," John said.

          They both shook their heads and sighed.
          "Hey," Pat said. "I've got this cool CD with a game called Shadow
     Warrior. It's excellent. Want to check it out?"
          "Sure," John said. "Got nothing else to do."
          "O yeah," he added. "My friend said that ZAR is shareware and
     that you'll have to register it. But that's another story."

     A joke set in a Saloon
     Forwarded by Barry Salter, 2:254/301
     Other contact details in .sig

     Hi everyone <waves>,

     Apologies for the title but I couldn't think of anything more
     descriptive that wouldn't give the punchline away.

     I got the following joke from a mailing list that I subscribe to. The
     original author forgot to put his/her name on it so I can't tell you
     who wrote it.

     Anyway, enough of my rabbiting ;) Here's the joke:

     -----8<-----C-U-T--H-E-R-E----->8-----

     A very small, sickly-looking man was hired as a bartender.

     The saloon owner gave him a word of warning: "Drop everything and run
     for your life if ever you hear that Big John is on his way to town."
     The man worked several months without any problems.

     Then one day a cowhand rushed in shouting, "Big John is a'comin',"
     and knocked the small bartender on the floor in his hurry to get out.

     Before the bartender had a chance to recover, a giant of a man with a
     black bushy beard rode into the saloon through the swinging doors on
     the back of a buffalo, and using a rattlesnake for a whip.

     The man tore the doors off their hinges, knocked over tables, and
     flung the snake into the corner. He then took his massive fist and
     split the bar in half as he asked for a drink. The bartender
     nervously pushed a bottle at the man. He bit off the top of the
     bottle with his teeth and downed the contents in one gulp, and turned
     to leave.

     Seeing that he wasn't hurting anyone, the bartender asked the man if
     he would like another drink.

     "I ain't got no time," the man roared. "Big John is a'comin' to
     town."
