             Go placidly amid the  noise  and  waste  and  remember  what
        comfort  there may be in owning a piece thereof.  Avoid quiet and
        passive persons unless you are in  need  of  sleep.  Rotate  your
        tires.  Speak  glowingly  of those greater than yourself and heed
        well their advice,  even though they be  turkeys.  Know  what  to
        kiss, and when.  Consider that two wrongs never make a right, but
        that  three  do.  Wherever  possible,  put  people  on  hold.  Be
        comforted that in the face of all aridity and disillusionment and
        despite the changing fortunes of time,  there  is  always  a  big
        future in computer maintenance.

             Remember  the  Pueblo.  Strive  at all times to bend,  fold,
        spindle,  and mutilate.  Know yourself.  If you need  help,  call
        the FBI.  Exercise caution in your daily affairs, especially with
        those  persons  closest  to  you - that tomato on your left,  for
        instance.  Be assured that a walk through the ocean of most souls
        would scarcely get your feet wet.  Fall not in  love,  therefore;
        it  will  stick to your face.  Gracefully surrender the things of
        youth, birds, clean air, tuna,  Taiwan.  And let not the sands of
        time  get  in  your  lunch.  Hire  people with hooks.  For a good
        time, call 606-4311,  ask for Ken.  Take heart amid the deepening
        gloom  that  your  dog  is  finally  getting  enough cheese.  And
        reflect that whatever misfortune may be your lot,  it could  only
        be worse in Milwaukee.

             You  are  a  fluke of the universe.  You have no right to be
        here.  And whether you can  hear  it  or  not,  the  universe  is
        laughing behind your back.

             Therefore,  make peace with your god,  whatever you conceive
        him to be: hairy thunderer or cosmic muffin.  With all its hopes,
        dreams,  promises,  and urban renewal,  the  world  continues  to
        deteriorate.  Give up.

      Is the Elist part of Policy 4.07

     By Bob Moravsik  2606/583

     An interesting "test case" is in the brewing.  It seems
     that the private region 13 conference listings
     in Adrian Walker's Elist were "abandoned".  After Mr. Walker's
     system sending out warnings and posting the expiration in
     a few conferences they were going to be deleted.

     HENCE I ELISTED THEM as the new moderator.  Just heard from
     the RC...he went berserk.  Threatened me with penalties:

     Phil Dampier said:

     "Your listing yourself as moderator of various region echos
     within this region in the ELIST constitutes excessively
     annoying behavior.  Your immediate relinquishment of those
     listings will prevent impending penalties which will affect
     your ability to participate as a node in this network."

     Dampier then went on placing additional requirements:

     "You can prevent these penalties by sending a message
     to Adrian Walker, who maintains the ELIST, stating that
     your submissions were in error and that you relinquish
     any and all authority to list these echos in the ELIST.
     A carbon copy of this message to my attention is also
     required."


     Naturally, I appealled his threats to Bob Satti and filed a PC
     Phillip Dampier for trying to bypass the *C chain.  The issues:

     1. Is the Elist an official part of Fidonet ?

     2. If no go to 8

     3. If YES...how ?

     4. Is listing anything that Adrian Walker will accept
     EAB pursuant to Policy 4.07 ?

     5. Can a RC threaten a node or does he have to file
     a PC like any other node ?

     6. Can his threat be appealled.  Seems that the ZC
     can rule on an advisory opinion request rather then
     waiting for the PC to move upward.

     7. Goto 9

     8. From 1.  Blazz...Phil Dampier..."fo"

     9. end

     Maybe this will stimulate some thinking in getting a
     RATIFIED policy on echomail.  Hopefully Adrian Walker
     will not compromise the passwords on the Elist as
     I don't intend to give them up.  I will give them
     up WHEN and IF Fidonet's policy requires it.

     Meantime R13 Conference is split into two parts.  One
     may be moderated by the RC.  The other is moderated by
     me and is Elisted.

     The Dampier listings were abandoned; Adrian Walker's
     notices were ignored...ya SNOOZE...ya Looze...

     CIA Drug Pushers?  Or is it all Goat shit?
     Fredric L. Rice (frice@stbbs.com)
     1:218/890.0 (818) 335-9601

     A glut of files have been coming in about the recient allegations
     that the Central Intelligence Agency of the United States has
     been dealing in drugs in a successfull attempt to suppress the
     blacks in the country.  I've discarded most of them and kept the
     files which at least attempt to offer some names, dates, times,
     and locations in the allegations.  Since this is an interesting
     social phenomena, I thought netters might find this stuff as
     interesting as I do.

     This isn't the first time I've seen these claims being made as I
     can recall such claims being voiced back in the 1970's.  Such
     allegations were largely ignored then and they quickly died out.
     What makes the repeat of these claims notable in the late 1990's
     is the fact that the social environment of the 1970's is quite
     different than the social environment of the 1990's.  In the
     United States _everyone_ wants to be a victim so they can claim
     they're not responsible for their own fate.  That attitude was
     epidemic in the 1970's yet not pandemic at the time.  Now things
     have changed and there is a need to blame anyone one can for
     one's lot in life -- and the CIA is a good, faceless, corrupt
     and widely-recognized evil entity which quickly serves as the
     fall guy.  Additionally _this_ time there are people willing to
     name names and be a bit specific about their claims.

     I suspect that more reasonably acceptable files will be added
     to the list of files that I'll keep so the Magic File Name of
     DRUGS will return the current FILES.BBS for this archive.

         The latest news during October 1996 is that the the United
         States terrorist organization known as the Central Intelligence
         Agency (CIA) has been heavilly involved in trafficing in crack
         cocain since the 1960's deliberately to suppress the domestic
         black populace and to keep them down.  The stories have taken
         on all the attributes of an urban legend except that it should
         more properly be considered a national hoax.  The difficulty
         of just passing off the stories as nonsense stems from the
         history of the CIA's involvement in selling drugs for firearms
         and firearms for drugs to support "freedom fighters" in other
         countries.  (Cnl. Oliver North's admissions of guilt were
         validated.)  The history of the CIA lends credability to this
         latest series of allegations and it's certain to be a long-
         lasting topic among conspiracy buffs and human rights
         organizations.  The Chairman of The Skeptic Tank routinely
         archives urban legend stories and makes them available to the
         general public as a matter of the Tank's charter -- we don't
         often hold the opinion expressed within these archives. - flr

     Response to Woodmore and Kindness
          by Bob Moravsik

     As to the practical aspect of a Zone policy why
     don't each of you read Section one of Policy
     4.07.  Local policies MUST meet certain tests.
     One important one is that they are REQUIRED
     by local conditions.  Not desired, wanted,
     needed etc...but REQUIRED.

     Zone one has no echo policy.  Some twit type try
     hard to market the situation where people
     think there is one.  Zone one HAS NO ECHOMAIL policy
     other then "biggest .bbs wins".  There are multiple
     and conflicting practices.   BUT NOTHING FOR WHICH
     a person's membership in Fidonet is at risk.

     Let me poise these questions:

     1. If the people that "vote" against a Z2 EP ignore
     it ...then what ?

     2. If those people put in another Z2ep is it anymore
     enforceable then Woodmorepol.

     Section one of the existing ratified policy contains
     wisdom.  Since message flow all over the world and
     since any node can link to any other node via any
     way...how do you expect to enforce a policy that
     is limited by geography..as to a technology that
     ISN'T.

     Look at the foolishness in Z1.  First there was
     an echopol attempt.  It spent more time on distribution
     then on policy.  It bombed.  Then we had "boppy".  The
     famous document which made believe.   It bombed.  Now
     the fad is "faq's".  All these things are openly
     ignored by most of Z1 (most members don't even know
     or care about any of them).

     OK WHAT IS THE SOLUTION:

     1. Tweek Policy 4.07 to correct it and make it
     easier to change.   Do it worldwide.

     2. Devise an internation echomail policy.  Don't even
     touch the distribution problem.  Let distribution
     system spring up as technology allows.  (Read the
     current policy...other then NC "host routing"..it's
     SILENT..).  The EP should be written around the
     ECHOLIST (like the nodelist).  Don't define new
     positions.  Let each *C do it ot allow delagation
     (appointment).  To have a seperate coordination
     system is technically stupid.  In Z1 the "ec's"
     have "grabbed" netmail too.  We have...ahem:

     FIDONEWS 13-42               Page 7                   14 Oct 1996


     "echomail routed netmail"


     3. Then have this policy ratified as per P 4.08
     (P 4.07 tweeked)

     A Z2 only policy is a waste of time.  Will each
     conference that flows in Z2 be subject to Woodmorepol.
     OF COURSE NOT.

     So...Mr. Kindness and Mr. Woodmore.  Instead of brushing
     off an article with childish comments.  Address the
     international impact of a zone policy on messages
     and moderators OUTSIDE the zone.  Is excessilly annoying
     behavior a geographical thing in cyberspace.  Can I as
     a Z1 sysop be excommunicated for DOING what a
     Z2 policy says is EAB.  THEN WHY SHOULD A Z2 SYSOP
     be excommunicated UNLESS the PROHIBITION IS REQUIRED
     by local condition...note required. (sec 1)

     OK...address these issues intelligently without the
     one liners.  Maybe a few other ZC's can tackle this.

     Attention NOBAN Subscribers:

          WARNING; Be aware of the following new, politically oriented,
     computer viruses that have been recently detected. Many are stealth
     viruses and will surreptitiously infect your system without your
     knowledge.  Also be advised, that many of these viruses are of a NEWLY
     DISCOVERED STRAIN that, it is suspected, can also infect the computer
     OPERATOR.

     (1) PAT BUCHANAN VIRUS: Your system works fine, but it complains
     loudly about foreign software.

     (2) COLIN POWELL VIRUS: Makes it's presence known, but doesn't do
     anything. Secretly, you wish it would.

     (3) HILLARY CLINTON VIRUS: File disappear, only to reappear
     mysteriously a year later, in another directory.

     (4) BOB DOLE VIRUS: Could be virulent, but it's been around too long
     to be much of a threat.

     (5) STEVE FORBES VIRUS: All files are reported as the same size.

     (6) DAN QUAYLE VIRUS: Their is sumthing rong with your komputer,
     but ewe cant figyour outt watt!

     (7) GOVERNMENT ECONOMIST VIRUS:  Nothing works, but all your
     diagnostic software says everything is fine.

     (8) NEW WORLD ORDER VIRUS:  Probably harmless, but it makes a lot of
     people really mad just thinking about it.

     (9) FEDERAL BUREAUCRAT VIRUS:  Divides your hard disk into hundreds of
     little units, each of which does practically nothing, but all of which
     claim to be the most important part of your computer.

     (10) GALLUP VIRUS:  Sixty percent of the PC's infected will lose
     30 percent of their data 14 percent of the time (plus or minus a
     3.5 percent margin of error).

     FIDONEWS 13-42               Page 10                  14 Oct 1996


     (11) OLLIE NORTH VIRUS:  Causes your printer to become a paper
          shredder.

     (12) CONGRESSIONAL VIRUS:  The computer locks up, and the screen
     splits in half with  the same message appearing on each side of
     the screen.  The message says that the blame for the gridlock is
     caused by the other side.

     (13) GEORGE BUSH VIRUS:  It starts by boldly stating, "Read my
     docs...no new files!" on the screen.  It proceeds to fill up all the
     free space on your hard drive with new files, then blames it on the
     Congressional virus.

     (14) ROSS PEROT VIRUS:  Activates every component in your system,
     just before the whole thing quits.  Then space aliens land at your
     daughter's wedding.


          My thanks to VET66@aol.com, jpitt689@primenet.com and the Dinky
     Dao Express for providing this timely warning.

     Latest Greatest Software Versions
     by Peter E. Popovich, 1:363/264

     Ah, bliss. I'm finally caught up! There are some issues pending, but
     they're all waiting for responses from authors. As of this moment,
     my inbox is totally empty.

     As I mentioned when I started working on this column, I will
     occasionally highlight a new (or newly updated) entry. This is the
     first:

       "BeeMail is a Windows 100% GUI FTS mailer, tosser, scanner and
       echomail processor. It can be used as a front-end mailer for any
       Windows or DOS BBS. There are two functionally identical versions
       of Beemail: win16 and win32."

       Fidonet contact info:  Andrius Cepaitis, 2:470/1  Freq:BEEMAIL

       Internet contact info: hq@beemail.com

                              ftp://beemail.com

       In general, I don't include entries for beta versions of software.
       I made an exception in this case, as the package is already in use.
       Beemail is planned to release around December this year.

     I removed the Apple CP/M section this week. Obviously, I'll reinstate
     it in the unlikely event I hear from a sysop who runs or authors BBS-
     related software for it.

     Next week, Apple II Software will probably get the axe.

     Phased out this week: Apple CP/M Software

     Phase-out highlights:
       This week: Archimedes Software Deadline for info: 18 Oct 1996.
       Last week: Apple II Software Deadline for info: 18 Oct 1996.
