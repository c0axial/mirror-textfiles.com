                  WHY ATTEND THE REGION 17 FIDO CONVENTION?

     Because . . .

     * the traditional "Curmudgeon tossing" event has been replaced this
     year with "Curmudgeon bungee diving" - an event more suited to the
     unique natural setting of the Menucha Retreat and Conference Center,
     high on a bluff overlooking the Columbia River Gorge.  Your early
     registration (before May 15th) entitles you to vote on which brand of
     shoes he will wear.  (The folks in Region 17 are already debating
     the length of the rope.)

     * it will be the only FidoNet convention on the West Coast this
     summer.  Although it's officially a "Region 17" convention, sysops
     and their guests from other regions are welcome to join in the
     usual exchange of banter, tall tales, and technical support typical
     of any FidoNet gathering.

     * it's incredibly cheap!  For a mere $70.50, adult Sysops can spend
     two days and nights (food and lodging included) on the 98 acres of
     lawns, woodlands and gardens which comprise the Menucha Retreat and
     Conference Center.  Reduced prices are available for children and
     students.

     * Oregon also offers:

                      * * * * NO SALES TAX! * * * *
     - - and an active market for hardware and software in Portland - -

     Have you sent your registration yet?

     Henry Clark
     124/6120


     Giant Lake Party Issue --

     All is well in the Hill Country.  We were blessed with
     outstanding weather ( perhaps not for hammock users ), and the
     fabulous Net 106 sponsors did the region proud.  Well over 2000
     people showed up ( including drive throughs ) and I can't begin
     to name everyone who made this a wonderful affair.

     As promised, the juicy stuff first.  Sarah and Kevin hit it off
     real well.  They spent a lot of time playing in the tent !
     John took a chapter from my book, 'The Phantom City', and
     routed himself into a couple of bucks.  Sell your Rent-a-car
     stock, I forecast a big second quarter earnings dip.

     With so many people, food was in short supply.  I believe I
     only had about 28 helpings of brisket and ribs;  just enough to
     keep the hunger pangs away.  Since I'm not a beer drinker I
     couldn't report on the supply, well except that $1425 worth of
     aluminum cans is probably a lot.

     Instead of kegs, people brought 'Breeding Ice Chests', inside
     of which a six-pack will multiple to a case in under an hour.

     Dewey brought his sailboat, and invited Kevin and I on a little
     excursion which turned into the 'big wind' deal.  We got his cat
     up on one pontoon which was exciting for us non sailer types.
     When it went over and my son almost drowned... ( oh, oops, that
     was my tent nightmare, sorry ).


     Rumors and Other Reports --

     Michael's Laser Pistol is so useful.  Flashlight, 'Hey you'
     attention getter, lazy evening technical discussion topic, 'Hey
     you' sighting device.  This is a major upgrade from electric
     water guns, can't wait to see next year's toys...

     "Ray really cooks up a mean brisket."  Quite a few folks
     said this.  He also took charge of the campfire... well I hoped
     so as I stood there with an old piece of aluminum, and he was
     shoveling hot coals into it with a machete ?!?!  You just had
     to be there.

     Why does it take 9 Sysops to set up Tony's hammock ?  One to
     watch for Dewey's truck, one to hold the tree...

     Tony and Kevin won the biker awards. Dewey and Ron, well,
     sorry...

     Wynn and Jeff, alias Mr. Opus and Mr. Echo...
     Dean's vicious guard dog next door...
     Ron's register swap, the lack of a ZEC...
     Boy the topics of conversation; a more powerful heap of thought
     provoking concepts could not be imagined !

     An Army Corps of Engineers representative dropped in to tell us
     of complains by some locals.  Seems that some people didn't
     understand the meaning of 'Sysop', and so, didn't know what the
     warning signs were about.

     What has a keyboard, display, digital circuitry and is
     programmable.  Why Mark's synth, of course.  Round that out
     with a recorder, two guitars and a dozen singers.  Sort of a
     Lake-Aid concert;  puts 4 year olds to sleep instantly !

     I especially want to thank :

      Merrilyn "Get off my hook, stupid" Vaughan,
      June "Pick up your feet" Parchman,
      Ray "Mr. Hot Coals" Byrd and
      Paul "Ginseng Guru" Sittler

     for the organization and support of this affair.


     Serious Mode On --

     It's nearly a cold day in hell when my son and I can get away
     from the daily grind and really have a good time together.
     There is a combination of adventure and leisure at the Lake
     Party which let's us totally forget the humdrum of our normal
     everyday world.

     The last trip to the toilet before hitting the sack is usually a
     big hassle at our house.  But you do it outside, with a
     flashlight, and your bed is in a tent next to a lake, and it's
     the most fun thing going ( at least until morning ).

     This is what it's all about.

                    Status of Zone Coordinator Election

     As I've previously announced, I'll be stepping down as Zone 1
     Coordinator on June 1.  Here's an update on the ZC election to help
     you provide input into your RC, if you're interested in doing that.

     Although there is no formal ballot, the following are the persons
     who have indicated a serious interest in the ZC job (alpha order):
          Tony Davis
          Ben Mann
          George Peace
          Bob Satti
          John Summers

     There are exactly ten voters in this election (the zone-1 RC's,
     with John Summers casting region 11's vote).  The deadline for the
     first round of votes is May 17.  If no candidate receives a
     majority of the votes cast, a runoff will be held between the top
     two candidates (or more, if there's a tie for second place), with
     the second deadline being May 24.

     The official announcement of the new ZC will be in the nodediff.

     Steve Bonine, 115/777
     Z1C
