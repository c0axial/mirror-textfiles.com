                            HOT NEWS

                This is the second FidoNews newsletter. There isn't
        much news this week, unfortunately. Please send some, and
        there will be.

                Last weeks article on security is included again,
        with an update.

                Fido version 10a has a bug, in entering download
        filenames. There is a version 10a 1/2 that fixes it.


                     ARTICLE SUBMISSION

                The format of this thing is totally ad hoc; please
        make recomendations as to formats, sections needed, liked,
        or hated, columns you'd like to see, or see removed,
        anything at all. If you want to submit something regularly,
        we can start a column for you.

                You are ENCOURAGED to send things in for the
        newsletter. ANYTHING is fit for the newsletter, such as a
        description of your board, problems found, questions, jokes,
        fixes, horror stories about wrong FidoNet numbers, things
        for sale, etc etc etc. 

                   SUBMITTING AN ARTICLE

                An article should have your name, node number (if
        applicable), followed by the text. Text can be any ASCII
        derivative; WordStar, soft paragraphs, 8th bit set, etc are
        all OK.

                Articles can be uploaded at either Fido #1 or #51,
        into the NEWS File Area, or by sending it by FidoNet. There
        is a convention for naming the files, so that the newsletter
        can be published automatically.

                            NEWS

                      HOW THIS IS PUBLISHED

                This is a totally electronic newsletter; articles
        are written of course by users and sysops, but all other
        parts and proceedures are machine generated.

                For each newsletter, the Editor (thats me folks)
        does the date and volume of the title page (tough job), and
        whatever editorial there may be.

                Articles are checked out for being readable (ie.
        more or less English language), and bum copies (bad uploads,
        etc) are deleted. 

                The lists generated by FidoNet Admin (St. Louis)
        such as the node list, Fido list, and the route list, come
        in via FidoNet during the week.

                On the day the newsletter is to be published, Fido
        #1 runs the text formatter (as a schedule) to produce the
        newsletter, using all the articles, the node and Fido lists.
        The completed newsletter is then copied into the NEWS file
        area. All of the article submissions are saved as last
        week's news, and deleted to make room for next weeks.

                Some canned messages are copied into Fido 1's mail
        area, which file attaches the newsletter to the distribution
        points. This completes the FidoNews Newsletter publication.
             FIDO SECURITY - Tom Jennings

                Last week I mentioned a way that a few systems have
        had their security breached; it seems I left out the
        simplest method of all. First, a summary of waht was said
        last week:

                Fido is pretty secure, but there have been a few
        instances where callers gave them selves SYSOP priveleges,
        and ran amok ... the cure is quite simple. 

                NEVER NEVER NEVER have your "main" Fido directory
        available as a download or upload area. Always make sure
        there is no path that can reach your .BBS files. It is OK to
        have it as a SYSOP only area, never let it be accessed by
        NORMAL users.


                If it is available, all someone has to do is get a
        copy of SYSOP.EXE, run it, and make a USER.BBS with them as
        SYSOP privelege. After uploading this file, they call back
        in, with the new name, and bingo! they are in control.

                A nastier version of this is to download your
        current user list, use SYSOP.EXE to upgrade them (or two, or
        three ... in case you find one of them) the upload it. 

                If this happens to you, delete USER.BBS
        *immediately*. Fix it so that the Fido area is not available
        to users, and then you will be safe.

                Better do it quick, now that it's all documented
        here.

                THIS WEEK'S UPDATE

                It is not necessary for anyone to go through all
        that rigamarole. All they have to do is download USER.BBS,
        get a copy of SYSOP.EXE, and see what the sysop's password
        is. And probably a few others' passwords as well. I will
        repeat the solution:

                NEVER! have your main Fido directory accessable for
        downloading. Never, never.

                If you suspect this has happened to you, DELETE your
        user list. Better to have everyone sign in again, than to
        have someone crash your board repeatedly.


                TIPS

                For some systems, you may need to have these areas
        accessable to some users. One way is to make that file area
        EXTRA or PRIVEL, and let only certain people get at it.

                If you want to make things in that area available
        for downloading, such as Fido or other programs, you will
        have to put a seperate copy into another subdir or disk.

                Fido does not filter filenames; it will let any
        accptable name pass though. This is a two edged sword; you
        have to be careful what you make accessable.

                Note that just because a file is not in the file
        list (FILES.BBS) doesn't mean it cant be downloaded. If it
        is there, it can be downloaded, regardless of whether or not
        it's in the list.

                Fido does check for device names, such as CON, AUX,
        LPT1, COM1, etc. It changes the second character into $, so
        uploading COM1 would become C$M1, etc. It will not let these
        names be downloaded either.
                                    IMMMMMMMMM;
                                    :VIEWPOINT:

        Moral outrage
        -------------
        V. Bachulis

        My weekly issue of INFOWORLD just arrived today, Thursday the 29th. It
        seems that the subject of software copy-protection is getting to be hotter
        and hotter day by day.  And not without due cause. In the issue prior to
        the one I got today, INFOWORLD did an article covering Vault Corporation's
        NEW "Killer copy-protection".  For those of you who are not schooled in
        the ways and wiles of copy-protection schemes, what the article had to
        say may be some food for thought.  

        Briefly, copy protection is basically of only two or three types.  The
fidonews.man --           11 Dec 84  00:58:55           Page 5


        main forms are either bad crc's or extra-long or extra-short sectors,
        which the PC can not read since it only uses 256k sectors on the average
        floppy you use.  There are other forms, some of which are more effective,
        and others which basically amount to nothing.  Symphony and MS WORD are
        two of the more prominent packages that come to mind for "sophisticated"
        copy-protection.  On the low end, the INFOCOM series comes to mind. But
        then again, it isn't a $500 dollar program, either.

        Now, it seems, software publishers are getting to be more and more uptight
        about people either A)Pirating their software (most of which isn't worth
        the disk it was copied on) or B)Making honest, legitimate backups of their
        valuable software.  Towards that end, Vault Corp. has come out with the
        ultimate in copy-protection.  What they propose is a form of copy-protec-
        tion that will, if an illegitimate (or legitimate) copy is made using some
        other method than purchasing a back-up disk or using a supplied program
        like those supplied with the PFS: series, literally, blow up your machine.
        Some of the details that were announced about this "new killer copy-protec
        tion" were that it would come up with a warning that the software was not
        a legitimate copy of the software, and it would then give you a certain
        time limit in which to shut off the machine or risk permanent damage to
        your machine and/or hard-disk.  The permanent damage you ask? It would
        release a "worm", which is a small program designed with the intent of
        doing some form of damage, into your PCs' ROM BIOS and all associated
        firmware and it would then proceed to destroy your system. Completely.

        Why do I take umbrage at this disgusting outrage?  Stop and think about
        it for a minute.  The lost profits from pirated software are not as
        outrageous as the industry would have us believe, and in many cases
        are blown totally out of proportion.  I am of the firm opinion that if
        a package is worth a damn, then the person who pirated the software
        will ultimately purchase the program legitimately.  For a second, even 
        stronger reason, consider the following quote from INFOWORLD:

               "Should we turn Vault's  worm loose  on medical  records
                stored in a database?  What if  one  of Defendisk's ...
                traps casually  omits  the fact  that some  5-year old-
                may have a fatal  reaction to penicillin?  I'm sure the
                grieving parents would understand that software pirates
                must be stopped. They should have been more careful when
                selecting their doctor. Couldn't they tell that this guy
                copies software?  And who cares if the pension  records
                of several hundred employees are capriciously destroyed?
                We can't have illegal copies of software floating around.

        What Vault and Defendisk propose to implement, and in some cases already
        have, amounts to nothing short of a total disregard for this nation's laws
        and principles.  This form of abuse of those who use and purchase software
        should not be tolerated.  Granted, software piracy must be stopped or at
        least controlled.  Until the industry takes a more rational, adult approach
        to the problem, this isn't going to happen.  What will happen is that when
        the first copy, legitimate or not, of this software blows up someone's
        PC and destroys all their critical data, be it patient data, or business
        records, there will be absolute hell to pay on the part of the software
        industry.  I will hazard a guess that the introduction of this new pro-
        tection will go so far as to put those companies out of business who
        utilize this form of protection.  Until we start to see companies like
        Borland International, who put out QUALITY software at a REASONABLE
        price, this little game of "bust the copy-protection" is going to continue
        regardless of whether or not there are lethal forms of protection running
        around.  I applaud Borland for their outstanding product and can only
        hope that the rest of the industry will follow suit.  Granted, Lotus
        or dBASE III may indeed be good programs, but they don't warrant the
        fee of $500 bucks a crack.  It is a long over-due for software companies

        to wise up and realize that they can't pull the wool over the end-users'
        eyes forever.

                                FIDO TOOLS


                There are now some handy programs that make using
        Fido easier, and add some new functions. They are available
        on Fido 1, probably others too, but I dont know where.

                TWIX

                TWIX has only one function; it prints out new
        FidoNet mail message on a printer or to a disk file. You can
        schedule it as an external event, and have it print out all
        mail received that night, so that you just look at your
        printer to see what came in.

                This works by looking for messages that haven't been
        read yet; if you read them first with Fido, TWIX will not
        print them.

                SOURCE for this program is available.


                NODELIST.EXE

                This program, by John Warren takes the NODELIST.XXX
        from Fido 51 and makes you a NODELIST.BBS. It will remove
        the 1 and area code for local (to you) systems, put in
        sprint or other dialing prefixes, enter costs as you
        specify, etc.

                One time only you put the needed information into a
        file used by the program, and after that just run it when
        you get a new list. It makes customizing the nodelist from a
        one hour chore to a 30 second simple task.


                WATCHDOG

                IBM PC and clones only: this program is used with
        the 0 command, and monitors the Carrier Detect signal from
        the modem. If carrier is lost while you are in DOS, it will
        restart Fido, so that another caller wont end up in your
        DOS. There are versions for COM1, COM2, etc, and source is
        available. By John Reinders at the Sailboard. (61)


                READMSG

                This does some of the Fido type message read
        functions, but from DOS, and lets you scan them, and
        optionally print them. This one is from Kurt Reisler, The
        Bears Den (74).
                TOM TCIMPDIS' LA BUST
fidonews.man --           11 Dec 84  00:59:12           Page 7



                The LA BBS bust is far from over. There hasn't been
        any news lately, apparently because they are going through
        the usual legal maneuvering, of hearings, pre-hearings, etc
        etc.

                However it turns out, this is an important case, and
        whether you believe it or not, it will affect you directly,
        even if you are not in LA and even if you are not a sysop.

                Tom's guilt or innocence is only a small part of the
        importance of this, and since most of us were not regular
        callers to his board, it is hard to comment on it.

                The underlying issue here is one of control: who is
        liable for the contents of a BBS? It was related to me (by
        someone who had lawyers persue it) that the status of BBS's
        is quite up in the air; are they common carriers (ie. the
        phone co.) or are they publishers (ie. newspapers). Phone
        companies have limited liability because they provide a
        medium, and not the contents, and are generally not liable.
        (If you arrange a sale for a stolen bicycle by phone,
        Pacific Bell is not resonsible). Publishers control their
        contents, and I think are liable for even the contents of
        their classified ads, though that is obviously impossible to
        ensure.

                You really should voice your opinion on this issue.
        It will not mark you as a political radical, and the FBI
        will not harrass your neighbors. It is your right, and our
        right to free communications.

                Losing this case will be a large step towards
        regulating BBSs. Regulation will mean the death of BBSs as
        we know it. We are unregulated, and are quite responsible
        and take care of our own problems. The trouble makers are
        far and few between. 

                Take the time to think about all of the systems you
        have ever called and patronized, and consider how they were
        run, how they were handled and how problems were solved. I
        think you will find that they take quite good care of

        Dear Sir,
           
                I would like to take this oppurtunity to speak in
        behalf of computer bulletin board sytems (BBSes).  Bulletin
        Boards are excellent ways to meet other computer users and
        hold intelligent conversations with them.  Bulletin boards
        are a very convenient way to get any help you might need for
        your computer, from advice on a game to programming
        techniques and technical information.   
           
                The idea that all of these bulletin boards are used
        solely for pirating of software and illegal telephone usage
        is one that is ill-conceived, stemming from the occasional
        "bad seed" of BBSes.  In reality, these illegal BBSes are
        few and far between, and are frowned upon by the general
        BBS-using public. 
           
            I urge you to consider all the good of which BBSes are
        capable, and not the bad side shown by several rare and
        unacceptable examples. 
           
            Thank you in advance for your consideration in this
        matter. 




                                   Sincerely, 

                        (print and sign your name here)
        REPRINTED FROM FIDO #36 - RAINBOW DATA - LOS ANGELES
        #22  14 20 Nov 84  09:19:31  
        From: Doug Brantley  To: All
        Subject: Fast Console Under MS-DOS
        According to the Nov. 84 issue of 'Digital Review'.......
        'Ever notice how slow your Rainbow screen output is under
        MS-DOS  version 2.05?  The people at the DEC-8000 hot line
        in Atlanta told me  to change the byte at address 40:19 from
        03 (hex) to 13. To do this  automaticalyy at boot-up time,
        add the following line to your  AUTOEXEC.BAT file:
        -
                            DEBUG<FASTCON
        Then create a file named FASTCON that contains the following
        two lines:
                            E40:19 13
                            Q
        Lo and behold, screen output now runs about twice as fast.'
        -
        I found this statement in the Tech Talk column on page 106.
        It is too  bad that more discussion was not given the
        subject. Why that byte and  how does it speed output to the
        screen? 
        -
        I did the patch and the screen output is much faster.

        #18  1 27 Nov 84  20:43:04  
        To: William Roberts
        Subject: fast console

              The MSDOS BIOS has this feature called the "fast
fidonews.man --           11 Dec 84  00:59:26           Page 9


        device". It has  two components: a bit in the device
        descriptor table (the 03 -> 13  patch mentioned) and the
        "fast device" code, pointed to by Interrupt  #29h.

            The idea is that if you have a device youd like to run
        real fast,  you can use this for output. There can be only
        one fast device in the  system, and it is almost always CON.

           If MSDOS finds the FASTCON bit set, then it uses INT 29h
        for all its  console output, instead of the normal BIOS
        call, which invokes a huge,  slow, paacket process for each
        byte displayed.

            Note that there has to be INT 29 code installed; you can
        write it  yourself, then set the bit in the table.
            This feature probably does not exist for MSDOS 3.xx.
