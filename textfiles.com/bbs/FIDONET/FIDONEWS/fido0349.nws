                               Time to Vote!

     Remember the draft bylaws we published  awhile  back?  A  lot  of
     people had some very good suggestions to make about them, and the
     bylaws  committee  listened  to  those ideas and made a few small
     changes.  I haven't read through it in detail,  but  the  biggest
     change  seems  to be putting in a way to change the bylaws later.
     It seems they forgot that one small detail the first time around.

     So we're running the  bylaws  again  this  issue  in  their  new,
     revised form.  The bylaws published in this issue of FidoNews are
     what we are now voting on.

     The  last page of this issue is your official ballot.  Run it off
     on a printer,  fill it out,  and mail it  in.  Everyone  who  was
     listed in node list 311 for 1986 gets one vote.  If you're in the
     node  list  twice,  you  still  only  get one vote.  Ditto if two
     people sysop one board, they only get one vote between them.

     You  have  until  17  January 1987 to get your vote in to the CPA
     firm that's counting them,  but don't wait until the last minute!
     Do it NOW, while you're thinking of it.

     About the board elections:  The interim board felt that it didn't
     make much sense to vote for a board before we know for sure  what
     YOU  want  the board to be like,  so we're holding off electing a
     new board until we find a set of bylaws you like.

     petition is valid,  the Secretary shall prepare a  ballot  asking
     the single question, "Shall the Director be recalled, yes or no".
     These  ballots  shall be mailed to all voting members represented

     majority  of  the  votes cast are for recall,  then the office of

     Stu Turk
     Sysop, SoundingBoard 129/26
     Pittsburgh PA

     As a result of a article I  wrote  for  FidoNews  last  December,
     outlining  the  use  of Fido by the Deaf / Blind,  David Drexler,
     sysop of SOURCEry System Fido 147/1, Oklahoma City OK,  put me in
     touch with one of his users,  Vernon Henley,  the producer of the
     American  Council  of  the  Blind's  Radio  Reading  Program  and
     publisher  of  ACB's  Braille  Forum.  Vernon asked me to write a
     companion article for the Forum and we began  exchanging  several
     messages  a  week  via FidoMail.  A large part of our mail volume
     dealt with the use of computers by the handicap  and  Vernon  was
     planing on organizing a Handicap Users Network similar to MedNet.
     At the time I was assistant sysop of the L-5Net Fido 129/13,  but
     the boards sysop was  planing  on  moving  to  Colorado  Springs,
     Colorado, and we were engaged in getting me set up with a Fido of
     my own before he moved.  My board, of course, would join Vernon's
     Handicap Users Net.

     Vernon  was  scheduled  to  come to Pittsburgh in May for a Radio
     Reading Program conference and we made plans to  meet  and  check
     out  the  local  watering  holes.  In  the meantime I had kept up
     correspondence with David Drexler  over  quite  a  few  different
     subjects, one of which, for some reason, was beer.  I had planned
     on sending a sixpack of my city's Iron  City  Golden  Lager  with
     Vernon  for David - had even composed a message "The bottles were
     full when I gave them to Vernon!" to send David as soon as Vernon
     was on the way home.

     SoundingBoard Fido 129/26 went online in May and one of its first
     fidomail messages was a congratulations from Vernon.  His message
     went on to other topics (he always used the entire 46 line limit)
     and ended with the note that,  due to his organizations  financal
     problems,  he might not be able to make the Pittsburgh conference
     the following week after all.  As his messages scrolled  off  the
     screen I though "Oh, great! Now how am I going to get the beer to
     David?"  when  the  next message scrolled on.  It was from David,
     telling me that Vernon Henley had died early that  morning  in  a
     house fire, shortly after posting that last message to me.

     Vernon   Henley   was   a   man  who  was  actively  involved  in
     communications for the handicap,  especially  in  radio  for  the
     blind and computers for the deaf.  He will be greatly missed.

     I  thought for a while that Vernon's dream of a Handicap User Net
     had died with him.  I did not know who else he had  been  talking
     to  about  joining  the  net  and  did not know how to set one up
     myself.  It was something that went on the "back  burner".  About
     that  time  sysops who had been playing with a new program called
     EchoMail began hearing the questions  put  to  them  change  from
     "What's EchoMail?" to "How's it work?" Net 129 installed a Sysops
     Echo,  of  which  I  was the hub and new uses keep turning up for
     EchoMail.

     In time,  a National Sysop's Echo  started  and  a  few  messages
     Fidonews                     Page 15                  22 Dec 1986


     showed  up  asking  if anyone was interested in a Echo conference
     for the handicapped.  I sent out a few feelers and get back a few
     replies and sooner or later things get started.  I got a  message
     from  Dr.  David  Dodell  of  St.  Joseph's Hospital Fido 114/15,
     Phoenix AZ saying he would host/co-ordinate  the  conference  for
     the  disabled.  This Echo deals with all subjects relating to/for
     the and disabled  (not  necessarily  computer  related)  and  its
     ripples  have  already reached coast to coast with the Echo being
     picked up by boards from Washington D.C.'s Insight  Fido  109/634
     to  Chico  CA's Lazarus Fido 119/5 and Links Fido 119/13.  If you
     have users on your board who are handicapped, or just want to add
     a  public  service  Echo,  contact  David  Dodell,  St.  Joseph's
     Hospital Fido 114/15 and join the ABLED Echo.

     Doug Mohney
     Fido 109/74 "The Bear's Den"

                         Doug's Column

         BEFORE WE BEGIN: SysOps are a strange breed. I need look no
     further than mine. Sent him mail last week to "fire off the
     puppy" (refering to my column). His response to me was "Loading
     the charge...elevation 45 degrees...Drop the dog. FIRE<Boom>
     <Yip>...Puppy away, sirrah." I think he's hacked UNIX systems
     for too long; most UNIX wizards are gonzo in some form or
     another.

         HOW MANY READERS DOES FIDONEWS HAVE? I've read the claim
     of 70,000. How is this number derived? Has someone polled all
     70,000? Or is it a projected number based upon number of
     FidoNet users? If this is the case, then it is an inflated
     estimate, because everyone who uses Fido doesn't have the
     time to read FidoNews. I would suggest a poll or reader
     survey, but if there are 70,000 readers of FidoNews, it would
     choke the network (or at least my home node) PDQ.

         IS FIDONEWS *TOO* COMMERCIAL? I don't know if it is my
     imagination, but it seems like a lot of people who send
     articles into FidoNews are plugging some product or service
     (Yes America, I am guilty of this too, but no one's offered
     me money for my literary skills, so I don't feel too bad).

         If this is case, shouldn't FidoNews charge a flat fee of
     $5 per promo (or something like that) in order to reemburse
     the people who put FidoNews together? C'mon. If there's money
     left over, they can always put it in the "Doug to Comdex"
     junket fund, eh?

         Seriously however, I think it is an idea worth considering.
     Perhaps a "shareware" type of arrangement. Oops. Maybe not;
     shareware is dying of apathy these days.

         NATIONAL USER GROUP? Apparently, Capital PC User Group,
     the IBM SIG of Boston Computer Society, and HAL of Texas
     (don't ask me what HAL stands for) got together at Comdex
     and talked about the feasibility of a national (yes, nation
     WIDE) user group. After some discussion, they decided that a
     true national user group was a bogus idea, but a "Federation"
     of user groups might not be a bad thing at all.

         I have mixed feelings about this, probably because my
     patron saint, Ben Franklin, tended to frown on complex
     organizations. Whenever you amass a group of people, you
     always get the power-greedy who want to use the situtation
     for their own gain. And bureaucracies tend to ignore the
     small, while trumpeting their "goal."

         However, a "Federation" does have some advantages,
     specifically in areas such as user's rights. If you have an
     obxiousness company like oh...a spreadsheet manufacturer,
     Fidonews                     Page 17                  22 Dec 1986


     you can send them nasty mail saying you dislike their cash
     cow policies on copy protection and make a big stink about it.
     They would (hopefully) recognized the vast masses of pissed off
     people are trying to tell them something important and change
     their policies accordingly.

         I dunno. On the other hand, bureaucracies tend to make a
     lot of rules and spend most of the time making sure their
     members adhear to them. Hmm. Anyone got any opinions on this?
     Is Fido a "federation"? If it is, how powerful is it? What is
     the focus of it aside from communications? Something to think
     about when you assume the lotus position.

         MOANING 'BOUT THE MAC: If you should happen to buy a Mac
     Plus, you'll notice you need to also buy your cables from Apple,
     plus your dot-matrix printer, since third-party Imagewriter IIs
     and mini-DIN 8 connectors are slim and none in the marketplace.
     It imposed a propietaryness which I find Offensive. You should
     encourage 3rd party competition, because ultimately speaking, it
     is what will sell more boxes.

         ON THE OTHER HAND: If you sit down and think about it, those
     ditzy little mini-DINs are soooo easy to snap into the back of
     the Mac; no contortions with screwdrivers in the back of the
     machine. And you only need to pick either A) An ImageWriter
     printer driver or B) A LaserWriter printer driver. How many
     printer drivers does it take to get an IBM-PC word processing
     program talking to another third-party printer you bought on
     sale at K-Mart?

         CD-ROM, O-ROM  == NO ROM: We've had CD-ROM and O-ROMs for
     quite a while. Yet, I don't see anyone rushing out to sell or
     buy CD-ROM/O-ROM type players. Why?

         Part of the problem is a lack of standards; no one wants to
     get stuck with an $1,000+ incompatible investment two years down
     the road. However, the way the standards committees are floating
     around, it will probably be another 2 years before we see any
     CD-ROM/O-ROM standard; just in time for the first $1,000/68020
     desktop machine.

         Another part which I think plays a key role is the concept
     of Read Only. "Yup, I got 500 Meg of storage here which I can
     only read. Amazing how many dictionaries you can put on
     one disk, ain't it?" C'mon! You must be able to write info
     out on all that storage as well as read it back.

         Optical storage will only take off when A) It is truly
     Erasable/Writable (WORM is relatively stupido, except for
     accounting functions and "hard" backups) and B) Standards
     are set for 12", CD-size, and sub (3 1/2") size.

         GOSH, YOU LOOK DIFFERENT DR. POURNELLE: Has anyone else
     noticed Jerry's pic in "InfoWorld" has changed? His old
     picture had him with this utterly arrogant look on his face,
     kind of like the one the Al Haig use to get into, and he was
     Fidonews                     Page 18                  22 Dec 1986


     dressed in an Ascot Tie, like he'd just stepped off the bloody
     YACHT, for crying out loud.

         His new picture shows no Ascot and I believe he looks
     almost friendly. Almost. Then you read his column and you wish
     he'd pull his head out of the CP/M graveyard....Actually, I
     must say his writing in "InfoWorld" is improving...for Jerry.
     I still miss Dvorak's column tho'.

        Registered programs and "canned" messages
                        -Ron Bemis 151/104

     There have been many comments about my methods of asking
     for donations for my shareware products.  My programs are
     "registered" to a particular net/node number.  Programs
     downloaded from my board are always registered to my node,
     151/104.  When one of these programs is run on another node,
     two messages are created:  one to the sysop of the board
     thanking him for trying the program, and one to me telling
     me that the node has used the program.  This second message
     is now created with the file attach bit set, causing the
     message to be sent directly via FidoMail and not routed
     through the normal chain of hosts.

     The first message created looks something like this:

     -----------------------------------------------------------

     From: Ron Bemis on 151/104
     To:   Sysop on 138/39
     Subj: OUTER V2.1

     Thank you for trying OUTER V2.1.
     A message was created informing me that you have tried it.
     Another message will be created each day you use OUTER V2.1.
     If you don't plan to use this program on a
     regular basis please delete these messages.
     Otherwise kindly register this program by sending $20 to:

     Ron Bemis
     PO Box 13279
     Research Triangle Park NC  27709.

              -Thanks

     It's unbelievable how many sysops have sent nasty messages
     about these messages being created.  Others have asked "How
     do I make it stop sending these messages?"  To answer this
     question, the best way to stop sending the messages is to
     register the program.  You receive a registered copy of the
     program immediately after I receive your check.  Programs
     running on the "registered" net/node do not create messages.
     To the sysop who needs 90 days to decide if a program suits
     his needs, you should pay for the program(s) you're using.
     I would hope that I would get ONE message from every person
     who has tried one of my programs.  Many utility writers have
     contacted me asking for source code for this protection
     scheme.  It's a good idea, and it works.  A sysop can use
     the program as often as he wants on a trial basis.  After
     running the program, he should then delete the messages it
     created. This only needs to be done once a day.  If/when the
     Fidonews                     Page 20                  22 Dec 1986


     sysop installs the utility into his RUNBBS.BAT file or uses
     it on a daily basis, that is the time when he should pay for
     the program.

     I'm trying a little experiment.  I've written a little program
     called "DIAL" which can be used through the ProComm (or other
     comm program's) shell to retrieve, display, and dial any
     FidoNet node.  It has absolutely none of this protection in
     it.  I'm distributing it as shareware and asking for a $3
     contribution if you keep it and use it.  I consider this to be
     a very useful program.  SEALink claims to be able to do this,
     but only on a SEAdog node.  I'm willing to bet that I don't
     get nearly the number of $3 contributions for this program
     as I have for the protected versions of my other programs.

     And to all the people who have complained about my automatic
     message creation:  put up or shut up!  If you don't like the
     way the program was written, delete it from your computer.
     That's what shareware's all about.  Seems that the people who
     complain the loudest are the ones who won't pay one red cent
     for my shareware, but also can't live without it.

     I'd like to hear any comments on this subject - I understand
     there's been a lot of talk in the National Sysop's echomail
     conference, of which I am not a participant.

     Christopher Baker
     Metro-Fire Fido, 135/14(0) XP:

                               SEAdog Mail Events
                            and FidoNet Compatibility

     Did you ever watch your system during a Crash mail event receive an
     incoming SEAdog packet from a Node that you were trying reach during
     that event? Did you notice that most of the time the other Node
     Refused to Collect the mail you tried to pass to him during that
     connect? Maybe you DIDN'T try to pass it to him and now YOU get to
     make ANOTHER call to transfer the packet to him. What a waste, eh?

     SEAdog differs from Fido in that mail is only transferred WHEN and
     IF the mail event you are in is set to GIVE-TO and/or PICKUP.
     SEAdog is designed with an inherently more secure mail transfer
     system than Fido for use in a corporate atmosphere where security
     may be essential to avoid compromising files or information. Within
     the FidoNet, however, this level of security is not necessarily a
     consideration.

     To make your SEAdog mail events (including Crash) MORE FidoNet
     compatible, BE SURE to insert the routing verbs GIVE-TO (All or
     whatever called for during an event; All is the best for maximum
     receptiveness.) and PICKUP (All or whatever, as before) into your
     ROUTE.DOG. This INCLUDES your S (Crash) Schedule. Oh, you DON'T
     have an S Schedule? Now would be a good time to insert one. The S
     schedule is very simple, as follows:

                     Schedule S
                     Send-to All
                     Give-to All
                     Pickup All
                     Send-only (redundant in Crash).

     Now your system will try to pass and collect mail whenever
     connected to another system during a mail event. If your Crash
     events are designated as S in your CONFIG.DOG, that is. The use of
     these routing verbs is the same in each of your Schedule listings
     in your ROUTE.DOG.

     If you are running a SEAdog capable Node that I call, I hope you will
     consider these points and help make our future transfers MORE
     successful. We Give-to and Pickup in ALL events at Metro-Fire Fido!

     Thanks.

     Jon Allen
     The CompuNet Zone
     Huntsville, AL
     Fido 18/20

         Although I'm  not much of a  writer  (as users who  read the
     B)ulletins  that I post  on my  BBS  will attest),  I decided to
     submit  this  article  after  several  experiences I  had.  Most
     Sysops are aware of "sponges"  (users who do absolutely  nothing
     but download software),  and  combat the  problem with  new user
     questionnaires,  download/time  limit quotas,  and so on. I have
     tried several  things  to correct  the problem,  and so far have
     been unsuccessful.

         I installed my  20meg  more than half a  year ago,  and have
     since  discovered  that  "sponges"  abound in  our  (at least in
     Huntsville)  BBS community!  Someone who downloads over 1100K of
     files,  uploads  ABSOLUTELY  NOTHING,  sends  no donations,  and
     leaves 0 messages  (to the Sysop or anyone else)  is not exactly
     every  system operator's  vision of an  "ideal"  user!  I may be
     unreasonable at times, but 1100K and no uploads? That's a little
     "wolfish"  to me.  Now, a  few  users  (on my system)  had  some
     explanations for that kind of behavior, such as:

         1. They are calling long  distance  and would  rather  spend
            their money downloading rather than uploading or  leaving
            messages.

         (Every "sponge" on my system was calling locally.)

         2. They are  unable  to  upload  since  they  are  a  new to
            telecommunications  (and therefore have no  Public Domain
            files  to  upload)  or they don't have  anything that the
            system doesn't already offer.

         (There are currently 3 (including myself)  IBM-based systems
          running here in Huntsville, each with a file system.  After
          spending so much time  downloading on my system,  I'd think
          they were  "raping"  the other  boards also.  (Hence they'd
          pick up software that my system doesn't offer.))

         3. They were overwhelmed by such an impressive  files system
            and caught "download fever".

         (Understandable.  We all have acquired  "download fever"  at
          one time or another.  However,  that impressive file system
          will not stay that way if users don't contribute.)

         4. Downloading.  That's what you're running a BBS for, isn't
            it?

         (Certainly not. Fido is not just an AE line by another name.
          Users  are expected to participate.  To quote  FIDOINTR  (a
          utility that tailors  WELCOME2.BBS  to each  user):  "Would
          you go  to  a  party a  spend  the  whole  time  sitting by
          yourself in a corner gobbling up hors d'oeuvres?")
     Fidonews                     Page 23                  22 Dec 1986


     The only reason I have a  substantial  file selection  is due to
     the fact that a good friend of mine, who had acquired many files
     over the years, uploaded most of what he had  (LBR'd) to my then
     empty  hard  drive.  (He was even nice enough to  include a list
     of descriptions.)

         I've been  told I've gotten  rather  harsh about the subject
     of sponges (ever since I started using RATIO the other day), but
     they should have expected some kind of action after my countless
     messages and bulletins literally begging for uploads.

         (Pole  RATIO  is a very good utility that (in my case) sends
          users who have taken more than  400K  and exceeded a  500:1
          [Downloads:Uploads]  ratio a reminder  to  upload.  It will
          then lower the access level of any user who  downloads more
          than 800K  and exceeds the 800:1 ratio. (And yes, it nabbed
          quite a few people.))

         Well,  that's my attempt  at an  article.  I know I  haven't
     touched on all points,  but I  wouldn't  want to take up most of
     FidoNews.  I'd appreciate  ANY responses, comments, or whatever
     via FidoNet.

     Well since I've hit college I haven't had a  chance  to  do  much
     with  or  for  fido.  And I miss it.  During the time I have been
     gone I have picked up and dropped bad habits.  Those being  Drugs
     and  Smoking.  I  feel  much  better now that I have stopped both
     habits.  They are probably the stupidest things I have ever  done
     to my body.  At the moment my only drug is Punk Rock,  and booze,
     maybe I should stop drinking to.  Oh well,  college is a pain and
     not being in touch with fido is even worse.

     My  new  column  here  will  last till I exterminate all of my PD
     games.  Yes it is my long awaited entertainment column I promised
     back when I wrote my first article.  This time I'll take  a  look
     at STRIKER, and SOLITAIR.

                                  STRIKER

     Striker  is  one  of  the  best  graphics  adventure games I have
     encountered so far.  In striker you must attempt to pick  up  and
     drop  off  spies and cargo shipments.  There are five missions on
     four levels.  Striker uses keyboard or joy stick.  It  has  color
     graphics,  but  I'm  not sure what the colors are.  (I have a red
     plasma screen.) You can change between 3 palettes  and  move  the
     screen  left  or  right.  STRIKER  also  has sound which can't be
     turned off.  This can cause problems when you play the game at  3
     am and your neighbors are trying to sleep.

                                  SOLITAIR

     This is one of the best computerized card games I have ever seen.
     Like  STRIKER  it  is color graphics.  The only cheating Solitair
     lets you do is go through the cards as many times as you can.  It
     is a fairly simple game to figure out and can be  won  by  almost
     any  level  of Solitair player.  The only problem I can find with
     SOLITAIR is that it doesn't always do a good job of shuffling the
     cards all of the time.  Besides that it is worth downloading.

                           +-------------------+

          Part 6: To Notch Or Not To Notch (That Is The Question)

        I would imagine that most of  the  readers  of  "The  Nautical
     View" are Commodore owners.  Well, this particular column applies
     also to Atari and Apple owners too.  We all own  home  computers,
     and use them to fulfill a fairly inexpensive hobby.  I would like
     to address one point, though: many people who  own  single  sided
     disk drives will cut a  notch  on  the  opposite  side  of  their
     diskettes, so that the disk can be flipped and the back side  can
     be used for data.

        Most of us have some kind of program which allows us to  check
     a disk for bad sectors.   You  can  indeed  "notch"  your  disks,
     format the reverse sides, and then check to see if the back  side
     was indeed good.  You can then store all the data  on  there  you
     like.

        However, a very serious problem can arise, one that many of us
     ignore so often.  After some use, dust particles  will  build  up
     inside the disk jacket.  The disk jacket  is  designed  to  catch
     these particles, thus avoiding damage to  your  disks.   However,
     when you put a disk in upside down, the disk starts  rotating  in
     the opposite direction.  This has the fun effect of RELEASING all
     that assorted crud that's been hiding inside the disk jacket  for
     the past year, and forcing  it  to  SCRAPE  across  the  diskette
     surface before being trapped again.  This can ruin the surface of
     the disk, and can even damage the read/write head  on  your  disk
     drive!

        Most people get away scott-free for so long  that  they  scoff
     when people like me tell them to STOP NOTCHING!  "Hey, man,  I've
     been doing it for years and haven't  lost  a  bit  yet!".   Well,
     "Hey, man" yourself.  I, too, had been doing  it  for  years,  as
     were many of my friends.  Then, one day, one of my disks showed a
     read error.  The error proved  to  be  of  the  "non-recoverable"
     kind, and a valuable program was lost.  Then, a little later  on,
     a few more disks bombed, and then a few more, etc.   The  data  I
     managed to rescue is now safe on SINGLE  sided  diskettes,  thank
     you very much.  I own a double-sided drive (the 1571),  but  when
     my  C-128  is  running  in  C-64  mode,  it  performs  like   the
     (single-sided) 1541.  Therefore I MUST  use  single-sided  disks,
     for my data's sake.

        For the  longest  time,  double-notching  your  disks  was  an
     effective way of curbing the high  price  of  quality  diskettes.
     But come on now: the price of disks has gone DOWN,  not  up.   An
     average disk nowadays is three times cheaper than it was, say,  5
     years ago.  I went out the other day and bought a pack of 25 GOOD
     Fidonews                     Page 27                  22 Dec 1986


     diskettes  (single-sided)  for  the  whopping  price  of   $19.75
     (Canadian).  That works out to 79 cents per  disk,  and  that  is
     pretty darn cheap if you have some valuable data.  Notching these
     disks would (eventually) turn them into BAD diskettes.

        I used to say "I've never had a disk fail,  so  why  should  I
     worry?", just like many of you.  You can stop  notching  now,  or
     you can wait for it to happen to you.  I learned the hard way, so
     I am here now to try to  prevent  this  from  happening  to  you.
     Please, DON'T double-notch your diskettes.

        I'm interested in answering any of your questions about either
     the C-64 or C-128.  If you are having a problem,  please  address
     your mail to Joe Lindstrom via TC-Link  Fido  (Calgary,  Net  134
     Node 7), and I'll address it in an upcoming article.

     For Sale: All Rights to Computer Game Program (GAGS)

     I am looking for a software publisher or other enterprise
     interested in acquiring the rights to the Generic Adventure
     Game System (GAGS), a text adventure-game development system
     currently available for all MS-DOS computers.

     GAGS is written in vanilla Turbo Pascal (7,000+ lines of
     code), and can be ported to other computer systems very
     easily. I am currently revising the program to make it
     "international," and am revising the manual extensively. I can
     make additional changes, or port it for a particular computer
     system if needed for a particular marketing effort.

     Earlier versions of GAGS were released as "Shareware."
     Shareware doesn't work for games.

     I am willing to consider all offers, including royalty
     arrangements, bundling deals, or an "all-rights" sale. If no
     reasonable offers are received, I will release the new version
