     The final installment of the FTSC docs appears in this Issue. If we
     get a new FTSC, they have docs of their own but nothing in the volume
     of the set now finished publishing. [grin]

     Speaking of webpages...

     Anyone know what happened to the Region 15 page? Region 19's is also
     reporting 'no such server' but that may just have been the load. How
     about ZEC2? Steve Woodmore came and went and then came back again but
     the ZEC2 and Z2Elist pages don't seemed to have followed. Anybody over
     there got new URLs for those? Zone 6's link also seems to have failed
     but that could have been the load as well. [Late note: got a NEW URL
     for ZEC2 at http://www.proteus.demon.co.uk/zec.htm which is now
     reflected in the FidoNet by Internet section. ZEC2 is still working
     on the new one.]

     And speaking of missing...

     Anyone know if Latvia's phone system is down? When I try to call over
     there I get a 'system unavailable' intercept and a regular poller from
     over there hasn't called here in a couple weeks.

     This is the last Issue of my first year as FidoNews Editor. Next week,
     1427 will mark where I picked up the ball when Tees disappeared [and
     no, I still don't know what happened to him or where he went]. Time
     sure flies when you're making the news. [snicker]

     Echomail rumblings in this Issue. Looks like the RECs may finally be
     organizing. What next? Echopol?

     What's new on the IC front?

     Announcing the FidoSpine Distribution System for Echomail

     Over the past years, Fidonet administrative echoes have seen an
     increasing amount of discussion about the status of echomail, routed
     netmail, distribution systems, etc.  A number of us charged with the
     smooth operation of Fidonet believe that individual nets and/or nodes
     need to be empowered to choose their source of echomail and routed
     netmail beyond the existing distribution systems.

     Accordingly, a number of Regional Echomail Coordinators and Regional
     Coordinators have collaborated in creating the FidoSpine Distribution
     System which will give all Regions, Nets, and Nodes an inexpensive
     partner for obtaining Echomail and File feeds, and will allow for the
     proper routing of netmail under the supervision of the Regional
     Coordinators and their assistants, the RECs.

     Currently, there are five major FidoSpine hubs that offer both
     landline as well as FTP and/or TransX feeds:

     Bob Seaborn, 1:140/1  bseaborn@quadrant.net
     Peter Rocca, 1:2401/305  rocca@multiboard.com
     Ed Georgen, 1:2222/1  ed.georgen@station-1.com
     Jerry Gause, 1:3651/9  gpgause@pdn.net
     Jim Balcom, 1:109/334  balcomj@daddy.com

     These five hubs can supply any net or node with the level of service
     they desire. For a list of echos carried by FidoSpine FREQ FIDONET.NOW
     from any of the above. Additional hubs are planned for each region.

     Please link into SP_GENERAL for more information about FidoSpine. Free
     feed for this echo is available from the above hubs or from the
     undersigned:

     Is The End Near?
     By: Clay Tannacore  1:372/4

     Is the end of FidoNet in the perceivable future?  Does FidoNet have
     the ability to withstand the plethora of users heading for The
     Internet?  Is the rapidly decreasing NODELIST any indication of
     FidoNets inevitable death?

     FIDONEWS 14-26               Page 3                   30 Jun 1997


     These are questions that I ask myself, daily.  These are the same
     questions many in FidoNet today are asking themselves.  These are the
     questions you should be asking yourselves as members of FidoNet.
     These are questions that should never have had to be asked by the
     members of this association.  For as surely as FidoNet was the biggest
     and best amateur association in the telecommunication field, it now
     must take a back seat to The Internet, because of the inefficient
     leadership of the association and a technology that at best is
     "dated".

     I think the time has come when we, the members of this association,
     need to take a careful look at just what is happening in FidoNet
     today.  Recently we have witnessed an attempt by a few to "customize"
     FidoNet to suit their personal agendas.  These individuals known as
     SSTARS or more commonly called the "BACKBONE" have without authority
     of POLICY4 taken it upon themselves to "censor" a certain conference
     by removing it from distribution by the "BACKBONE".  Without
     notification to the moderator of the conference in question, all three
     SSTARS agreed (purportedly) to halt distribution of this echo,
     contrary to procedures set forth in POLICY4.  Conspiring with the
     three SSTARS was a "self appointed" individual who called himself the
     Overseer of Backbone Operations (OBO).  This malcontent who conjured
     up this OBO position, did so again without authority of POLICY4.  The
     three SSTARS and the OBO apparently have come to some sort of
     agreement to isolate, if not totally removed, the *EC position from
     FidoNet.

     The malefactors in their attempt to take over FidoNet, or at least
     "control" it by means of "EchoMail blackmail", have given the members
     of this association a choice.  You either "live with the way we want
     things to run, or go to hell and find another way to get your mail".

     The above is but one small episode in the path of destruction that I
     fear FidoNet is following.  There are many others equally as
     devastating taking place, and no one in a position to halt these
     infractions is doing anything (apparently) at all.  The members have
     raised their voices in protest, but have been silenced by either
     ineptness as to how to do anything, or through the lack of support of
     other members who care little about FidoNet and haven't the
     testosterone to engage in battle those who would bring down this
     brotherhood.

     Another reason for my concern pertaining to FidoNets conceivable
     demise is I have just finished reading the latest addition of FIDONEWS
     (1425), in which the editor (Chris Baker) make reference to the lack
     of distribution of our newspaper in Zone 2.  POLICY4 says that
     FIDONEWS is "the glue that hold us together" (or some such nonsense),
     in which case we had better start looking to another "fastening
     device" to do the job.  FIDONEWS has now turned into an outlet for the
     American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) enrollment/membership campaign
     and fund raiser.  We find ourselves reading how great they (ACLU) are,
     and what they have done for us in the telecommunication fields.
     GREAT!  Let us all send in our last cent to an organization that is so
     anti-American, that even the old USSR wouldn't tolerate it.  No matter
     what your opinion is concerning the ACLU, I see little value of
     publishing their agendas in our (FidoNets) news-letter/paper.  Why
     FIDONEWS 14-26               Page 4                   30 Jun 1997


     can't we have articles published by SysOps in FidoNet?  Why hasn't the
     "leadership" of FidoNet attempted to "keep in touch" with the common
     folks by using this media?  Why must it be left up to the sycophants
     (like myself) to publish their views in FIDONEWS?

     Why, why, why?  I'll give you my opinion.  Because we deserve just
     what we're getting.  We have allowed the power-brokers to manipulate
     FidoNet for so long, it would take a massive enema to clean up the
     crap we have to live with now.  We have sat back and watched the take
     over with the attitudes that "someone else will put a stop to this"
     for so long, we have forgotten how to do battle.  We have become a
     slothful bunch of indolent jerks, with no backbone and a testosterone
     level of piss-gnats.  Not me of course, I have a good excuse for not
     fighting back.  I'm Italian!  That's just about as good of an excuse
     as anyone else out there has, so, why not?

     Folks, we need to take action (lock-n-load) quickly if we ever want
     this association to live.  We need major adjustments to POLICY4
     [4.07].  We NEED an EchoMail (ECHOPOL) policy that ALL can agree on,
     and we need to get it implemented, PDQ.  There has been a new
     conference established specifically for discussions pertaining to an
     EchoMail Policy and it's called "FIDOECHOPOL" and I encourage EVERYONE
     to import it, and participate in it.

     In the meantime, I wish you all the best, and I apologize for the need
     I felt in writing this article, as I know how infuriating I can
     be . . .  [snicker]

      FTSC Issued Product Codes
      by David Nugent, December 9, 1995.

         For many years, the FidoNet Technical Standards Committee has been
         issuing product codes for use in FidoNet products used on the
         network (specifically those products responsible for creation and
         exchange of data over the network; products creating FidoNet type-
         2 packets described in FTS-0001 and mailers talking together using
         FidoNet protocols described in FTS-0001, FTS-0006, FTS-0007 and
         FSC-0056. The primary purpose of using these product codes was not
         to create a registry of FidoNet related products, but to
         facilitate the identification of products responsible for network
         problems and providing a means by which authors might be contacted
         by the Committee should problems with a specific product be
         brought to its attention. Products issued with FTSC codes

         In respect to this objective, the results have only been partially
         successful. True, the product code list has been used from time to
         time both to identify aberrant products and also to contact
         authors and is still occasionally used for this purpose by both
         Committee members and others.

         The number of products which can be allocated FTSC product codes
         had some years ago exceeded expectation. Since FTS-0001 "type-2"
         FidoNet packets allocate a mere 8 bit field for the product code,
         that set the effective maximum number of products which could be
         allocated a product code to 256. All numbers had been allocated or
         reserved by early 1991.

         The issue was discussed at some length by the FTSC which debated
         first the worth of continuing to issue product codes, and secondly
         if the practice was to be continued, to effect changes in the FTS-
         0001 packet header format to accommodate at least a 16-bit (two-
         octet) product code. The first issue was resolved in favour of
         retaining the product codes, but as yet, now in 1995, the second
         issue has not been resolved by Committee members. Two of the later
         FSC documents submitted to the Committee had indeed allocated an
         additional byte for the product code, but had elected to reuse the
         existing product code byte as the 'lower' half of the new product
         code, which would cause existing products to be incorrectly
         identified by existing FTS-0001 compatible FidoNet
         implementations.  The behaviour of this incorrect identification
         has an undefined effect. Both proposals were rejected by the
         Committee on that basis.

         FidoNet product codes are used in the following circumstances:

          a) by mailers during FTS-0001 sessions; session negotiation is
             the exchange of FTS-0001 packet headers,
          b) by products which create type-2 packets,
          c) by mailers during negotiation of FTS-0006 (YooHoo) and
             FSC-0056 (EMSI) sessions.

         FTS-0006 sessions allocate 16-bits for a product code, and
     FIDONEWS 14-26               Page 7                   30 Jun 1997


         FSC-0056 places no specific limits on size (although a 16-bit or
         32-bit limitation might be implied and used in implementations).
         The conclusion from this is that FidoNet product codes are still
         useful to FidoNet mailers during session negotiation using FidoNet
         enhanced handshaking protocols. Therefore, product codes are now
         being issued only for mailer products with FTS-0006 and/or
         FSC-0056 capability.

         FidoNet products without an allocated product code which either
         create type-2 packets, or negotiate FTS-0001 sessions must use a
         product code x'fe or 254 in type-2 compatible packet headers. This
         code as been reserved for that purpose (use by product without a
         product code). The product code x'ff or 255 has been reserved to
         indicate that the product code is stored elsewhere in the packet
         header at an as yet unallocated offset (please do not use this as
         yet - this FSC will be modified accordingly when FTS-0001 is
         updated to designate the correct offset).

     The proposed new information text in nodelist trailer is as follows:

        ======== NOTE: No flag implies another. Each capability MUST be
        specifically listed.  If no modem connects are support, the
        nodelist speed field should be 300.

        Conversion from old to new ISDN capability flags:
        - Nodes in the USA currently use the 'ISDN' flag.
          Most will be able to change to V120H (64k lines).
          Also many to V120L,V120H (64k lines) with autodetecting
          equipment.
          Some to only V120L (still with 56k lines).
        - Nodes in Europe currently use the ISDNA, ISDNB and ISDNC flags.
          A simple translation will do the trick here.
          ISDNA -> V110L
          ISDNB -> V110H
          ISDNC -> X75

        Status of this document:

              This document proposes a standard for the Fidonet(tm)
              community and for other networks using Fido technology. It
              may be freely distributed if unchanged.

              You can reach the author at one of the addresses listed at
              the end of the document.

        Abstract:

              Most fidonet message editors offer a "forward" function.
              Using this function a user A can sort of "redirect" a message
     FIDONEWS 14-26               Page 9                   30 Jun 1997


              from user B to another user C, maybe because A is not the
              correct recipient or because C is a better person to answer
              the message. The name and address of B are usually included
              in the forward in free-text format.  The message text is
              included in non-quoted format.

              A problem arises when the final recipient C wants to reply to
              sender B of the forwarded message. The forward contains the
              intermediate user A as the sender. So user C must insert the
              name and address of B manually, using the information
              contained in the message text. The message editor of C can't
              do this automatically because of the free-text format. The
              editor will also use incorrect quote initials, which is at
              least irritating.

              This document introduces 6 new control lines which contain
              the header information of the original message. With these
              control lines the message editor can use the original header
              information automatically.

        Specifications:

              There are 7 new control lines: FWDFROM, FWDTO, FWDORIG,
              FWDDEST, FWDSUBJ, FWDAREA, FWDMSGID. As all control lines
              they start with an ASCII 01 character followed by the control
              line name followed by whitespace followed by the control
              line's content followed by ASCII 13.

              Please note that all these control lines do not have a colon
              (like the control lines in FTS-0001). This would be just
              waste of space.

              FWDFROM
              -------

              This control line contains the name of the original sender as
              found in the FROM field of the original message. Leading and
              trailing whitespace should be removed. This control line
              should be omitted altogether if the FROM field is empty.

              FWDTO
              -----

              This control line contains the name of the original recipient
              as found in the TO field of the original message. Leading and
              trailing whitespace should be removed. This control line
              should be omitted altogether if the TO field is empty.

              FWDORIG
              -------

              This control line contains the address of the original sender
              as found in the ORIG field of the original message. The usual
              5D ASCII notation (zone:net/node.point@domain) should be
              used. This control line should be omitted altogether if the
              address is not known.
     FIDONEWS 14-26               Page 10                  30 Jun 1997


              FWDDEST
              -------

              This control line contains the address of the original
              recipient as found in the DEST field of the original message.
              The usual 5D ASCII notation (zone:net/node.point@domain)
              should be used. This control line should be omitted
              altogether if the address is not known or unsure
              (as it is the case with forwarded echomail messages).

              FWDSUBJ
              -------

              This control line contains the subject line of the original
              message.  This control line should be omitted altogether if
              the SUBJ field is empty.  This control line should by made
              optional for security reasons. Echo manager passwords are too
              easily revealed with it.

              FWDAREA
              -------

              This control line contains the name of the echomail area
              where the original message was forwarded from. It should be
              omitted altogether if the original message was not forwarded
              from an echomail area.

              FWDMSGID
              --------

              This control line contains the MSGID control line of the
              original message. It should be omitted altogether if a MSGID
              control line is not present in the original message.

        Usage:

              When the "forward" function of the message editor is invoked,
              the editor program should generate the proposed control lines
              from the header of the original message. If the original
              message already was a forwarded one (indicated by the
              presence of at least a FWDORIG control line), the editor
              should keep all FWD* control lines and should not add any
              FWD* control lines. This preserves the FWD* control lines of
              the first forwarder, containing the header data of the author
              of the original message.

              The editor should not generate FWD* control lines, if the
              message isn't to be forwarded. A mail forwarding robot may
              also generate these control lines, if it not just readdresses
              the message.

              When the "reply" function of the editor is invoked the
              program should use the control lines' contents instead of the
              header information. The control lines should not be included
              in the reply.

     FIDONEWS 14-26               Page 11                  30 Jun 1997


              Since it may not be immediately clear whether the user wants
              to reply to the forwarder or to the original sender, the
              editor should offer a means to ignore the proposed control
              lines and start a "normal" reply instead, e.g. by two
              distinct functions, user preference or dialog.

              Pseudo code:

              forwarding_message:
                 if is_forwarded_message then
                    don't change FWD* control lines
                 else
                    add FWD* control lines

              quoting_message:
                 if is_forwarded_message then
                    if reply_to_forwarder then
                       use header data (normal quoting)
                    else
                       use FWD* control lines
                    remove FWD* control lines from reply
                 else
                    use header data (normal quoting)

              other_functions:
                 remove/ignore FWD* control lines

                 From: Joe User 1:234/567

                       ...

        Compatiblity:

              Editor programs which are not prepared for the proposed
              control lines usually just ignore them and remove them from a
              reply. A reply goes to the forwarder. Nothing gained and
              nothing lost.

        Implementations:

              This proposal is implemented in the author's Fidonet editor
              "FleetStreet for OS/2" (versions 1.17 and above).

       Reduced seen-by lines
       Frank Ellermann, 2:240/5815.1

       Abstract
       --------
       A way to save great amounts (estimated 10 %) of echo mail traffic by
       reducing "seen by" informations, compatible with existing echo mail
       tossers conforming to FTS-0004.

       Definitions
       -----------
       A thorough understanding of FTS-0004 is required, the reader should
       be familiar with PATH and SEEN-BY lines in echo mail, illegal and
     FIDONEWS 14-26               Page 13                  30 Jun 1997


       legal echo mail distribution topologies, i.e. dup-rings, as well
       as with some pre-requisite knowledge of zones, 4D and 2D addresses,
       and the "sticky" 2D notation in PATH and SEEN-BY lines.

       PATH: path lines as specified in FTS-0004
       FSB:  full seen-by informations as specified in FTS-0004
       TSB:  tiny seen-by informations as mentioned in FTS-0004, see below
       RSB:  reduced seen-by informations specified below
       dupe: multiple arrival of the same echo mail (e.g. different paths)

       Examples of echo mail distribution topologies
       ---------------------------------------------
       In all examples a) to d) echo mail entered at system 1 is sent to
       systems 2 and 3 with FSB 1 2 3. Therefore system 2 (3) knows, that
       system 3 (2) already got this mail, topology a) is perfectly legal.

       a) 1 - 3  b) 1 - 3  c) 1 - 3  d) 1 - 2
          | /       |   |     | / |     | X |
          2         2 - 4     2 - 4     2 - 4

       In the exanmples b) and c) both systems 2 and 3 forward all mails
       from system 1 to system 4, these topologies contain a dup-ring and
       are therefore illegal following FTS-0004.

       The examples a) and d) show fully connected polygons with three or
       four nodes. In example d) a mail entered at system 1 is sent to
       systems 2, 3, and 4 with FSB 1 2 3 4. The topologies a) and d) are
       perfectly legal, there are no dupes caused by distribution.

       In example b) each mail entered at system 1 reaching system 4 via
       system 2 carries FSB 1 2 3 4, therefore system 4 will not forward
       such mails to 3. Using TSB at system 2 the same mails would carry
       TSB 2 4, therefore system 4 would forward them to 3 as dupes.

       Note that illegal topologies as in example b) and c) cause dupes
       with either FSB or TSB. The real problem with TSB is example b),
       as it allows for loop mails on the dup-ring 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - ...
       and vice versa, if no additional checks for dupes are employed.

       With RSB (specified below) systems contained in the PATH are not
       stripped from the seen-by informations, therefore RSB avoid loop
       mail much like FSB.

       FSB algorithm
       -------------
       1) add own system to the PATH.
       2) all area links not contained in the FSB qualify as recipients.
       3) add own address(es) to the FSB set if not already contained.
       4) add recipients to FSB, sort FSB, forward mail to recipients.

       TSB algorithm
       -------------
       1) add own system to the PATH.
       2) all area links not contained in the TSB qualify as recipients.
       3) strip old TSB and start new TSB with own address(es).
       4) add recipients to TSB, sort TSB and forward mail to recipients.
     FIDONEWS 14-26               Page 14                  30 Jun 1997


       RSB algorithm
       -------------
       1) add own system to the PATH.
       2) all area links not contained in the RSB qualify as recipients.
       3) strip RSB addresses not matching an address in the PATH, then
          add own address(es) to the RSB set if not already contained.
       4) add recipients to RSB, sort RSB and forward mail to recipients.

       PATH considerations
       -------------------
       There are 2 problems with the PATH kludge as specified in FTS-0004:

       First like in the FSB the addresses in the PATH are 2D, and having
       the same 2D address in different zones is possible. Therefore zone
       gates are required to use the TSB algorithm. Unfortunately the PATH
       is forwarded without regarding zone gating, therefore detection of
       loop mail based solely on the PATH could be erroneous.

       Further FTS-0004 (written 1989) expects future echo mail tossers to
       implement PATH support, but doesn't require this support from old
       implementations. Strictly spoken the PATH is still only an option.

       In some areas of FidoNet (e.g. in zone 2) at least all non-terminal
       nodes are required to fully support the PATH line, therefore this
       problem will probably not show up in praxis. Of course any tosser
       implementing the RSB feature is required to fully support the PATH.

       Summary
       -------
       To show the benfits of RSB compared with FSB assume the following:

       An echo mail travels from node to echo hub, host, major star, echo
       host, hub, and finally arrives at a recipient. Each routing system
       has 10 links, i.e. FSB at the recipient contain 51 addresses, about
       400 characters, but RSB only 15 addresses in about 150 characters.

       Therefore in an echo mail with 2500 characters about 10 % of its
       size can be reduced using RSB in favour of FSB. If this estimation
       is applicable on world wide FidoNet echo mail traffic, RSB can save
       us an immense amount of costs.

       This document can be adopted by the FTSC as FTS, in this case it
       has to be regarded as an addition to FTS-0004 with the extension,
       that all non-terminal nodes are required to support PATH lines as
       specified in FTS-0004.

         public

      and the Number 1 Other Boycott of the Southern Baptists...

      1> The New York Yankees, because George Steinbrenner is an
         assho -- Uh, a wretched sinner

                One of my favorite things to do when I was
                 a kid was to watch TV.  I know it sounds
                funny, but it's true.  Ah, reckless youth.
