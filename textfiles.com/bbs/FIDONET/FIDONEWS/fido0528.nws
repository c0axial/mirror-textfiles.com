     Lynx is  a mult-user BBS system that supports 8 com ports, 31000
     messages  areas,  31000  file areas, has 31000 access levels not
     including the special bit field flags.

     Lynx  also  use  the one  message file structure for the message
     bases  and all  the messages  in all  the areas go into the same
     file.  This  one  file  structure is  also extended to cover the
     system  files as  well.  The message  area and file area control
     files are contained in one single file instead of a multitude of
     system  control files.  So, no matter how many message areas you
     might  have,  you'll only  have  one message area system control
     file.

                            Lynx Menus

     Lynx  has 3  help levels, much the same as Fido or Opus, but the
     big difference is the FULL help menu. This menu must be designed
     by  the sysop.  It's a simple text file that you can create with
     any  word  processor or any ANSI program such a THEDRAW. You can
     create both an ANSI menus or an ACII menu or combine then into a
     single file  using the LANSI  commands for color and Moving ANSI
     graphic's.  You  also  have  the  option  of turning the default
     prompt off and  adding a customized menu prompt to any menu. The
     Lynx  script  processing  commands can be used in these menus so
     you can get as fancy with them as you like.

     The  second  and  third help levels are much the same as Fido or
     OPus and you have to accept the default system prompt there.

                                Commands

     To  further  allow you total control over your system, the sysop
     must also  select  the command  keys to  activate the associated
     options. For example, at the main menu, the command to go to the
     file  area can  be set  to F, D, ESC, control-F, etc. It doesn't
     matter  what  you  want  to use, the idea is that you select the
     key. And, these  command keys do NOT have to be the first letter
     of the command.

     Not  only do  you set the command keys, but you also have to set
     the  individual  access  levels  for  those  keys.  Now, the big
     difference  here  is in the message and file areas. Each message
     area has it's own cluster of command keys and associated command
     key  access  levels.  Message  area 1  might use the A to switch
     areas with an access level of 5 while message area 2 might use C
     to switch areas with an access level of 3. Doesn't make sense to
     do  it  that way but the ability is there if you want to use it.
     The same thing goes for the file areas.

     Each message area and each  file area has a default access level
     required to gain access. To further enhance this, each file area
     and each message area also has a set of 8 flags. You can set any
     one of  the  eight flags or a combination of the 8 flags and the
     caller  must  have  the  same set of flags turned on in his user
     record  to  gain access to that area no matter what his standard
     access level is.

     Lynx  also  has the supports Tradewar's 1000, RBBSdoors, PCboard
     programs, Who else is online, CB chat, Baduser, New upload scan,
     New  Mail  scan,   Last  caller  to  system,  caller  count,
     upload/download ratio warning with automatic no Downloading when
     this  ratio  is  out  of wack(setable by the sysop), single file
     extraction  from  an  archive for downloading with full cleanup,
     automatic  no  uploading duplicates on the system, ANYWHERE. All
     of this is built into the Lynx system plus more.

     The  uploading  section  supports Ymodem, Ymodem Batch, SEAlink,
     Zmodem,  Hyper-Drive,  and finally Xmodem. Callers automatically
     receive  upload  credit  in  the  form  of  the  time they spent
     uploading  the  file along with an increase in their downloading
     limits.  The  files. bbs  display is quite attractive and loaded
     with  information.  Each  file  has a 3 line display showing the
     file  name,  filesize,  times  downloaded  on  the 1st line. The
     second  line  shows who uploaded the file and when they uploaded
     it, and  finally  the  3rd  line is the 80 character description
     field.  All uploads are posted at the TOP of the file instead of
     at the bottom. For those of you that like to include little area
     description  headers,  Lynx also allows for a header.qbs file in
     each  of  your  downloading  areas.  If  this  file  exists, its
     displayed  before  the  files are listed out when a file list is
     requested.  You  can  include  anything  in  the header.qbs file
     including  script  processing  commands. Caller's can also set a
     user record auto-protocol switch so that Lynx will automatically
     use their protocol when uploading and downloading.

     Lynx  also  has  a  fairly  large  text  file  script processing
     language that includes a set of LANSI commands  much the same as
     those  in  Opus.  You  can  set  any color combination that ANSI
     supports   with   these  script  commands  including  foregound,
     background, reverse video, and even video screen modes.

     Netmail and Echomail? Yes, both are fully supported.

     Now,  I  can't tell you EVERYTHING that Lynx is capable of doing
     unless I wanted to just include the doc's so I'll close this up.

     If  you  would  like  to  see Lynx in action, we have the system
     setup  to  except  human  callers  between the hours of 8 PM and
     10:30  AM  CST.  The  phone  number is (314) 334-6359 or for you
     Binkely / Dutchie people, 100/504 or 1/116. File area 1 also has
     the  lynx  doc's  available  for  downloading if you'd like more
     information.

     There is also a Lynx echo for anyone that would like to tie into
     it.  Tie  in  points are 157/505, 157/46, 100/504, 44/504, 46/1,
     440/1. Contact the sysops of these nodes for more information as
     to WHERE you can tie in.

     11 June 1988

     C O P I N G   W I T H   R A P I D   G R O W T H   Part 1

     Last week I put forward some ideas for dealing with Trojan
     Viruses.

     I'm hoping to do a regular weekly series. Next week's will be a
     detailed technical proposal in response to Ben Baker's article
     about the "Nodelist Crisis" in FidoNews 522. This week's is just
     an introduction to that proposal.


     THE NODELIST CRISIS

     Ben proposed a switch to Region based nodelists because the full
     international list will soon be just too big for processing.
     Clearly it WILL get too big, and the problem SHOULD be addressed
     now. But I believe there are other solutions that CAN preserve
     Tom Jennings original concept of FidoNet as a "fully coupled
     network" - where EVERY node has an accurate CURRENT address for
     EVERY other node that it communicates with.

     An INTERIM solution is for new XLATLIST type software to process
     NODEDIFF files that contain full net/node addresses for the lines
     changed instead of line numbers. This would allow each SysOp to
     just specify which nets and nodes they want to keep track off,
     without maintaining full copies of the entire nodelist below net
     or region level (where they are needed for file request by new
     nodes etc.)

     But in the long term, even NODEDIFF files WILL become too big for
     regular weekly processing, so eventually a more radical change
     WILL be needed.

     The technical problem with region based lists is that MANY nodes
     have regular communications with nodes outside their region or
     zone for both mail and file requests. FidoNet technology enables
     cheap and efficient communications between people who have common
     interests but are NOT in the same geographic region.

     When one sees a message in an international conference its
     important to be able to just whip of a private reply, or a file
     request, without HAVING to go through a Regional OGATE or make
     special arrangements for processing "foreign" nodelists.

     The solution I propose is a means for nodes to AUTOMATICALLY
     obtain continuous current updates of their nodelist entries FOR
     THOSE NODES THEY COMMUNICATE WITH. Most nodes will have a MUCH
     smaller list than all the nodes in their Region, let alone all
     the nodes in the world. But as long as that list can be
     automatically and continuously updated, it meets ALL the
     requirements for a "fully coupled" network.

     FidoNews 5-28                Page 6                   11 Jul 1988


     The key problem is that as soon as a user enters a message to a
     new node, not previously communicated with, the current nodelist
     entries for that node have to be automatically obtained and added
     to the local nodelist.

     My solution is simple, and also overcomes the problem of
     addresses from "foreign" networks like AlterNet appearing in
     EchoMail conferences where they cannot be easily replied to.


     SOLUTION

     Just include the full nodelist lines for each node within
     EchoMail messages from that node, in addition to the
     zone:net/node.point address shown on present * Origin lines.

     If standards for including that information are developed now,
     then future BBS software can automatically update the local
     nodelist whenever a user wants to reply to an EchoMail message.
     (With additional lines for the other nodes inwards routing Hub
     and Host if necessary).

     After all, probably 90% of NetMail and file requests are
     generated in response to EchoMail. (Or FidoNews articles, which
     can use a similar system). Most of the rest would be in response
     to NetMail messages received (again as a result of EchoMail or
     FidoNews articles). These can be handled by automatically
     extracting nodelist lines from NetMail packets. (For direct mail
     sessions the Wazoo protocol already exchanges BBS name and SysOp
     name and could easily add phone number and flags etc. This could
     result in AUTOMATIC updates to MAKENL by local *Cs who have
     regular netmail sessions with their nodes. Instead of arguing
     about whether to elect *Cs, let's automate them!)

     Nodelist entries initially obtained in this way, can be kept up
     to date as part of EchoMail importing. It shouldn't be too hard
     for the EchoMail software to watch for changes in those entries
     kept locally and update them automatically while importing. A
     method like the ConfMail dupelists can be used for fast lookup of
     CRCs to flag when a nodelist entry for a "known" node has
     changed.

     For those few cases where CURRENT nodelist lines haven't been
     obtained from recent NetMail or EchoMail packets or direct
     NetMail sessions, outgoing messages would have to be delayed,
     while an automatic request for updated nodelist lines is made to
     a "directory server". These "directory server" nodes at regional
     or net level could reply automatically - like MEGALIST or
     MGMLINK. Their replies would then be automatically incorporated
     in the local nodelist, like AUTOECHO updating an AREAS.BBS file.

     A major problem for this proposal is that EchoMail is insecure
     and fake nodelist lines could be generated by anybody
     impersonating another node. This can be overcome using "public
     key digital signature" techniques as described last week for
     dealing with Trojan viruses. This can also provide additional
     FidoNews 5-28                Page 7                   11 Jul 1988


     benefits for secure and authenticated NetMail and EchoMail.

     A minor problem is that SEEN-BYs etc already add too much to each
     message sent, and we don't want more superflous information in
     every packet. There is a technical solution to that too. Details
     in part 2, next week.


     WHY IT MATTERS

     Over the next few weeks I'll also be explaining why I think these
     technical issues have important policy implications. Its based on
     our experiences over the past year since Communet joined the
     Australian Region of FidoNet, where all netmail and EchoMail has
     ALREADY been routed through a single regional OGATE, controlled
     by the Australian Regional Coordinator, John Blackett-Smith.

     Our experiences show that a political problem can arise if the
     network does not remain "fully coupled". FidoNet internationally
     COULD cease to be a network dedicated to the "free exchange of
     information", as has ALREADY happened in Australia, where we are
     rather less "fully coupled" than most US Regions.

     Two weeks after we joined FidoNet, we were summarily kicked out,
     because the then Regional Coordinator, who was also our net host,
     did not like the "Political Overtones" of files in our internal
     file areas. (He did not actually READ any of the files, but he
     logged in and objected to the NAMES of files called "DONTVOTE.*"
     relating to current Australian elections.)

     The *C decided we were a "nest" of "commies" and because of this
     political prejudice, we found ourselves suddenly totally isolated
     from the net, as he was killing incoming NetMail.

     We appealed against that and were promptly removed from the
     nodelist by John Blackett-Smith for "ideas beyond the acceptable
     limits of the normal political spectrum".

     We appealed against that, and Australian SysOps discussed our
     "case" WITHOUT US BEING ABLE TO TAKE PART. Not being in the
     nodelist makes it rather difficult to answer accusations!

     June 23 will be the first anniversary of our excommunication from
     the Australian Region of FidoNet and we will start publishing
     full details. Unbelievable as it may sound, NOTHING has been done
     to put us back in the Australian Region nodelist in the entire 12
     months.

     It has proved impossible for us to communicate freely with
     Australian Region FidoNet nodes, and impossible to get either the
     Zone 3 administraton or the International Coordinator to do
     anything about it. Hence my interest in the problems that can
     arise from splitting FidoNet into regions that cannot easily
     communicate with each other except through regional OGATEs.

     That's the political background to my proposals for a nodelist
     FidoNews 5-28                Page 8                   11 Jul 1988


     structure that is not subject to the arbitrary whims of
     megalomaniac *Cs.

     Meanwhile, a few days ago was the first anniversary of our
     announcing ourselves in FidoNews 424. As background to who is
     making these proposals I am republishing an article from
     Communet's President, written a week or two after we first
     joined.

     * Hello from Communet

     Peter Green Communet, 631/326

     June 7, 1987

     Communet ("Communications Network for the Community") was setup
     six months ago by several non-profit community groups in
     Melbourne Australia, including the Community Interest Computer
     Consultancy, the Working Women's Centre and the Coalition Against
     Poverty and Unemployment.

     As we are new to FidoNet, this article is to explain who we are
     and seek contacts with other nodes anywhere in the world that may
     have similar interests. We are particularly anxious to join any
     international Echomail conferences discussing social and
     political topics likely to be of interest to our members, as well
     as technical topics relevant to establishing our network
     facilities or assisting community groups to make the best
     possible use of computers.


                            TECHNICAL PLANS

     Due to very limited budgets, we need to establish communications
     facilities as cheaply as possible, yet with greater technical
     sophistication than typical mainframe systems, so they can be
     easily used by our non-computer literate constituency. We will
     therefore be generating lots of technical questions about the
     best way to do different things. Hopefully we will also be able
     to contribute some answers when we have gained more experience.

     Our primary aim is to establish a national computer network to
     link micro-computers currently used simply for wordprocessing by
     various non-profit community groups and other organisations. We
     are working jointly with ASYNC ("Australian Students Information
     Network Committee"), which is planning a similar service,
     primarily to exchange material between student newspapers.

     When funding is available, multi-user AT or 386 based Unix
     conferencing systems with large fixed disks will be established
     in each major city, linked by packet network channels for
     continuous parallel updating of all conferences in all cities. A

     gateway will be maintained to FidoNet, both for general access
     purposes and to transfer messages, files and Echomail to users
     operating "Dutchie" point software.

     The main services Communet will offer are Computer Conferencing
     and Email and file exchange for remote typesetting and Desktop
     Publishing of text files uploaded from wordprocessor software.
     But we are also interested in chatlines, multi-player role
     playing games and just about anything else that will encourage
     non-computer oriented people to get a modem and hook up!

     Initially, we have established a single line private FidoNet
     node, currently running Opus 0.0 under SEAdog 4.00, as a
     preliminary test system. This is accessed regularly by members
     and associates of Communet to become familiar with various
     aspects of communications networks and to provide some initial
     services. As our orientation is towards non-computer literates
     and we lack technical knowledge, especially with Unix and
     communications networks, we hope to learn a lot from other
     FidoNet users. But we also hope to eventually contribute some
     ideas of our own.


                               PHONE NUMBER

     Although we are not yet open to the general public, and therefore
     do not want our phone number listed in the nodelist where it
     could encourage calls from numerous BBS users, we would welcome
     direct file transfers and crashmail from other FidoNet nodes
     around the world. This can be achieved by simply including the
     following line in XLATLIST.CTL or equivalent:

     PHONE 631/326 61-3-482-1718


                           PLANNED SERVICES

     Two Communet services almost operational are:

     1) 'Community Calendar' - a continuously updated list of
     activities and dates for public meetings and other events.

     2) 'Public Radio News' - a professionally edited daily news feed
     for Public Broadcast stations around Australia. This will have
     associated with it a discussion area for feedback on news stories
     and comments on current events. We anticipate that users with a
     wide range of different political and philosophical outlooks will
     find this a useful way to debate and exchange views, and that it
     will spawn separate discussion areas on particular topics.

     Other groups that have expressed an interest in setting up
     conference topics and interstate hook-ups include the Community
     Arts Network and Community Youth Support Schemes.  They are keen
     to learn how to use Opus boards, and will be seeking funding to
     obtain the necessary hardware.

     Aims of Communet are:

     1. Establish a network to link computers used by computer groups
     and their members at minimal cost and maximum performance.

     2. Promote computer conferencing in Australia, by encouraging and
     assisting the setting up and running of such conferences and by
     providing access to international conferences and databases.

     3. Provide computer communications services to the community
     sector comparable to those available in corporate networks, and
     to promote the the use of computer communication between
     community groups.

     4. Establish an influential position for the community sector in
     exploiting computer conferencing and build this up as a counter
     to the press and TV monopolies.

     As Australia's mass media are dominated by a very small group of
     large owners, we see the potential for computer conferencing to
     provide an alternative media that is far more democratic and
     interactive - allowing users to participate in the media rather
     than merely consuming it.

     We also see computer conferencing as having great potential for
     breaking down international barriers.

     At present these potentials are mainly being used by people with
     a technical interest in computing. But as the cost of hardware
     keeps falling and the quality of software keeps improving, more
     and more non-computer oriented people will join in.


                               THANKYOU

     We would like to thank everyone involved in FidoNet and public
     domain and shareware software development (especially Opus and
     related utilities) for the help and inspiration already received.
     We look forward to meeting lots of new friends in the matrix.

     Note: We aren't 3:631/326 any more, we're now a CANADIAN "point"
     - 1:221/162.14 But our Australian phone number remains the same.

     A few days after that was written, we were thrown out.

     A year is long enough. The FULL story of how the Zone and
     International Coordinator's dealt with the abuse of power over
     the nodelist by *Cs in Australia will now be told.

     Leonard Mednick
     Fido 345/1

                 LEONARD MEDNICK for UNITED STATES SENATE

     I love America!  Where else could the son of immigrant parents
     run for a seat, on the republican ticket, in the senior house of
     the United States Congress.  As a matter of fact, even for the
     presidency this year.  Therefore I am privileged to now announce
     my candidacy for the United States Senate to you, my fellow
     sysops.

     Later in this article, you will read my position on major
     issues, and also my resume.  Two major points of my program are
     to extend the peace initiative President Reagan began in Moscow,
     recently; and to wrench our disgraceful federal deficit into
     control!

     I am also concerned by the many attempts of government to
     interfere with the joyful fulfillment our electronic hobby
     affords us.  Now government wants us to be responsible for ALL
     postings on our boards even when many of us are handling
     hundreds, even thousands of messages a day.  There is a nagging
     in my brain that if we do not band together to stop these
     incursions, it will not be long before the FBI, or some other
     agency will be knocking on our doors.  This situation cannot be
     tolerated and it must not be ignored.

     Senator Goldwater (R-AZ) has long championed the amateur radio
     operator (ham) community.  We, in the amateur computer
     communications community have no such champion.  I promise that
     when I am elected, I will always carry our message to my fellow
     senators.

     Now the nitty gritty.  Unless you are a registered voter in the
     state of Hawaii, you cannot vote for me.  But modern elections
     are won, sad to say, by those with the most money, all too
     often.  That is where you can help me, and help us all.  If you
     know members of any Political Action Committees (PACs), please
     bring my name to their attention.  Show them my position and
     resume.  Ask them to send me money, NOW!  That is what they are
     in business for.

     Post this article onto your bulletin boards.  Disseminate it as
     widely as you can.  Even with non-FidoNet sysops!

     Senators are elected by their individual state electorates but
     campaign contributions come to them from all over the world!
     Check with your employers, your professional or trade
     associations and your friends.  They can help in our campaign to
     protect rights of sysops by sending their contributions to:
