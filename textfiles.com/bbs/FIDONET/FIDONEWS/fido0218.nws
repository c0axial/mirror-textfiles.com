                        In Defense of Copy Protection

        No, I haven't lost my marbles.  And no, I don't like copy 
        protection either.  But there IS more than one side to this 
        issue, and I'd just like to point out a few facts for the 
        other side.

        The major problem in this industry today is software piracy.  
        It's been estimated that over half the copies of 1-2-3 in 
        use by major corporations are pirate copies.  Wordstar does 
        even worse than that.  One of my sources tells me of a major 
        international corporation where almost every PC is equipped 
        with a large assortment of pirated software, and the people 
        using it see nothing wrong.

        I've lost count of how many times I've heard people complain 
        that the software houses should "get rid of expensive copy 
        protection and just price the stuff reasonably."  I'm told 
        that Lotus charges far too much for 1-2-3, and that if they 
        only asked (figure varies, generally under a hundred bucks) 
        then nobody would pirate it and they'd make more money.  

        Bull chips.  They could sell it for ten bucks a pop, and

        people would STILL pirate it.  As for the price being 
        unreasonable, I have news for you.  The retail price of 
        1-2-3 would just about get you my services for ONE DAY, so 
        think for a minute how much 1-2-3 would cost if you tried to 
        get someone to write it for you.

        The upshot is that when a company does an honest piece of 
        work and produces a quality piece of software, they deserve 
        to make some bucks on it.

        ============================================================
                                  NEWS
        ============================================================
        In view of the expansion of Fido, I would like to propose an 
        idea for reduced-cost mail, involving low overhead on the 
        part of each local board, and a LARGE overhead on the part 
        of the network manager.  

        Fido COULD send mail from local dialing area to local 
        dialing area, but to do this would involve creating a graph 
        containing all Fidos, each graph containing COMPLETE routing 
        instructions for point-to-point transfer.  At each receiving 
        station, (pardon my LISP) take CAR(ROUTE-LIST) as the next 
        node to transmit to, and send CDR(ROUTE-LIST) as the New 
        ROUTE-LIST.  Upon arrival at the desired point, CAR(ROUTE-
        LIST)=NIL, and the message has arrived at its final 
        destination.  The file sent could easily be small relative 
        to ROUTE-LIST, and each Fido would have to store (#NODES)^2 
        maximum ATOMS - this is a HUGE amount of disk overhead.  

        The idea I would like to suggest would be that each FIDO 
        store a route map for its LOCAL hub only, with designated 
        Fido GATEWAYS to the next hub in the direction of travel.  
        Each GATEWAY would have LOCAL numbers leading into a new 
        hub, would check the final-destination address, and pass it 
        to the next hub.  The incoming gateway would then route to 
        an appropriate gateway in its hub, or to its final 
        destination if in the current hub.  

        The biggest problem in this is the construction of the map - 
        and what to do in the event of a GATEWAY FAILURE (i.e. the 
        gateway is down or otherwise unable to pass messages).  
        Adaptive routing would be nice, except that this involves a 
        large communications overhead (each active node must 
        periodically pass the list of LOCAL Fidos that it can 
        actually contact to each GATEWAY in its hub.)  My guess is 
        that this would entail an additional 15-20 minutes per day 
        (or mail period) in receiving and transmitting local connect 
        information.  If adaptive routing is not made automatic, one 
        node would have to determine the map of local nodes and 
        gateways, and go from there.  Inter-hub linkages should be 
        made redundant (i.e. if hub 1 wants to talk to hub 2, there 
        should be more than one gateway to hub 2, if at all 
        possible.) 

        The message traffic bottleneck would come at the GATEWAYS - 
        it would be essential that (1) the gateway have sufficient 
        hard disk storage to hold all incoming or outgoing mail for 
        the HUB!!! and (2) the gateway have the capability of 
        reporting to the net the failure of another gateway, so that 
        alternative routing can be generated.  The mathematics 
        involved in this part of the problem would be (1) topology 
        and (2) graph theory.  Andrew Tannenbaum's "Computer 
        Networks" (Addison-Wesley, 1981) discusses these topics in 
        relation to mainframe point-to-point networks (the examples 
        are ARPANet and IBM's SNA), and discuss the possible 
        solutions.

        I currently have a program which is used to solve this type 
        of problem in a generic sense - it is a modification of DR's 
        NETWORK2.PLI program.  In order to use this program, it is 
        necessary to construct an exhaustive list of the local 
        dialing area overlap relative to FIDO nodes.  This program 
        as presently written is memory bound - I do not think that 
        the mapping for a 1000 node system could be stored in less 
        than 384K on a PC under PC-DOS 2.1 (we run the program on 
        the CompuPro here in house to solve LAN gateway problems.) 

        Under Fido version 10i, the point-to-point could only be 
        handled within a local hub - there are two main reasons that 
        it would be difficult to use for other purposes: 

        (1)  There is no provision in the FidoMail to place more 
        than a total of two destinations for a file - the first is a 
        transmit-to address for an incoming gateway, the second 
        being the final distribution address.  This would make it 
        possible to make a two-jump transfer - transmit to an 
        incoming during National Mail, and then redistribute during 
        a local mail period.  This would be practical for messages 
        between, say, New Haven and Bridgeport, with an incoming 
        station in Milford.  

        (2)  The amount of time it would take to make a long 
        distance trip would be prohibitive.  Suppose that using 
        local-to-local jumps, you could have a message make three 
        jumps per day - about 50-70 miles.  It would take about 40 
        days to get to a destination in California!!!  Also, 
        discontinuities would exist between many locations - those 
        locations would be unreachable under the FREEMAIL concept.  
        In the event of a gateway failure, either a new FREEMAIL 
        route would be needed (adaptive routing), or the mail would 
        be further delayed - possibly forever if the gateway remains 
        down.
