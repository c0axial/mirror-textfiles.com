                             Like Pulling Teeth


     My  dental  hygenist is mad at me.  It seems I'm doing everything
     wrong.

     I wouldn't mind if they'd just make up their minds and settle  on
     something.  But they keep changing what I'm supposed to do!

     I  think  I've  heard four different "proper" ways to brush one's
     teeth in my life.  First I was told that one should brush up  and
     down  in  front,  and side to side in back.  Then I was told that
     one should brush in a rotary motion.  Then I was  told  to  brush
     teeth "the way they grow" (whatever THAT means).  Now I'm told to
     brush  all of my teeth side to side for a few strokes,  then away
     from the gums.

     Take dental floss.  What could  be  simpler  than  dental  floss?
     First I was told to use waxed dental floss.  Then I was told that
     waxed  dental floss was no good,  and I should use unwaxed dental
     floss.  Now they tell me that unwaxed dental floss can  cut  your
     gums, so I should only use waxed dental floss.

     If  anything at all can be simpler than dental floss,  it's gotta
     be toothpicks.  I'd always been told that I should  never  use  a
     toothpick.  I  should  use dental floss instead.  Never mind what
     kind of dental floss -- it's already  too  confusing.  But  if  I
     absolutely  HAD  to use a toothpick,  I should never,  ever use a
     wooden one, since they can put splinters in your gums.

     You guessed it -- my dental hygenist made me promise to use these
     funny wooden toothpicks several times a day.  They're supposed to
     stimulate my gums, or something.

                        THE VIEW FROM "DOWN UNDER"

     Hello world... greetings from the Fido Network in Australia.

     I read Ed Rauh's article in FidoNews Volume 7, No. 48 with much
     interest as he was addressing some of the points I raised in my
     correspondence with him.  Ed was particularly kind and very
     diplomatic about what I in fact wrote.  The terms I used were
     somewhat stronger, but I did consider them valid, nonetheless.

     If the IFNA committee ends up with people who show the interest
     and dedication that Ed displayed in this case, then the future of
     FidoNet is assured.  Thanks for your time and trouble, Ed.

     Now, to get to the real point of my article.

     In FidoNews Vol. 3, No. 46, 1 Dec 1986; Doug Mohney (109/74) put
     in his wish list for Fido.  Among the items was a "Phone
     Directory" for Fido systems.  In fact, I had suggested this very
     thing some months back in a message to FidoNews.  (No, I didn't
     have a copy of the FidoNews standards at that time.)

     As I am most interested in this idea, I would seek feedback from
     other sysops on this matter.  The benefits of a directory are
     many, but the ones that I see as the real advantages are whether
     a node does international mail, whether it has any special
     interests, membership requirements and an address where potential
     users can contact the sysop to pay membership fees, etc.

     To this end, I am proposing to commence compiling the
     International FidoNet Directory, which will be made available at
     regular intervals on (hopefully) at least one node in each
     region.

     Obviously, the task is a big one.  If you would like to help out
     by perhaps maintaining the directory for your own region, please
     contact me via mail or telephone (or by post!).

     Initially, I am seeking the following information:

     Board Name:                    FidoNet Address:
     Board Telephone Number(s):

     Sysops' Name(s):
     Postal Address:
     Telephone Number:            (voice)

     Hours of Operation:                    Mail Schedules Observed:

     Fidonews                     Page 4                   22 Dec 1986


     Is the Board devoted to a particular speciality?  If so, what?

     Is the Board Public?

     Membership fee (if any):

     Does the Board reply to International Mail?

     Any item which is not to be included in the directory should be
     marked 'NFP' (Not For Publication).

     This information can be sent to me in the following ways:

     1. By NetMail to 626/229

     2. By post to:       Alan Salmon
                          PO BOX 788
                          BELCONNEN  ACT 2616
                          AUSTRALIA

     If you should wish to call me, my telephone numbers are:

                          61-62-58-9081 (voice)
                          61-62-58-9967 (data)

     Please remember the time difference if you call me on voice!

     Hope to hear from you.

     Regards from "Down Under",

     Alan Salmon.
