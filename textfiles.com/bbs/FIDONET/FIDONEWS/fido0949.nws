Editorial: Shut up it's good for you

by Tom Jennings (1:1/23)

Slowly, ever so slowly I get around to things.

With this issue starts a new regular column, "Ask EFF!", devoted to
answering questions about online rights for sysops. It will hopefully
run at least monthly. Please send any questions you have about online
rights to "Ask EFF" at the FidoNews address (like it sez in the
column), and I'll forward them on to Shari Steele at EFF. How the
process works somewhat depends on the number of questions received.

If you don't know what or who the EFF is, the Electronic Frontier
Foundation was formed by some people concerned about preserving and
extending our communication rights into the electronic world(s). They
have defended a number of cases such as Steve Jackson games, and
pioneered some interesting stuff in Washington DC. While I hope the
EFF will occasionally send me some propaganda I mean articles to run,
you can see some of their work in a filearea on the FidoNews BBS. If
you have Internet access, you can contact them at eff@eff.org, or FTP
files directly from them. (They don't run a BBS or have direct FidoNet
access.)

Dear EFF,
There is a long message on a Fido echo about some New Jersey tv station's
"expose" on, horrors, porno GIF images on BBSs.  Enclosed in the message
are a couple of statements that the U.S. Senate is looking at a bill that
would require BBSs to register with the government.  Naturally, no bill
number or sponsor was named.  But have you heard of any such proposal?
Thanks!
Adam


Hi Adam.
The thought of the government making such a requirement of BBSs is pretty
scary stuff.  Fortunately, however, there was no such bill introduced in
the Senate last term (or the House, for that matter), and I don't
anticipate one being introduced next term either.



Dear EFF,
I am the sysop of a Public BBS system that supports files and the general
chit chat found on most BBS systems.  However I would like to start
networking message areas that deal with phone/computer system topics.  The
messages will be checked before any of the user-posted messages can be read
by another user to make sure people are not posting long distance carrier
codes or system accounts, but I would also like to have a legal disclaimer.
 Is there any way you could help me with this?  Thanks.
Rob


Hi Rob.
It's a good idea to include a disclaimer if you intend to read and edit
user messages.  There is no standard disclaimer, but you could try
something like this:

FidoNews 9-49                  Page 3                       7 Dec 1992


***NOTICE***  Illegal activity is not permitted on this board.  Users may
not use this BBS to post any illegal messages, such as those containing
codes for gaining unauthorized access to computer or telephone systems.  To
ensure legality, all messages will be read by the sysop prior to posting.
The sysop will edit and/or delete messages that he believes contain illegal
information.  Do not leave messages you do not wish to be read, edited
and/or deleted by the sysop.

Note that with this disclaimer you are only giving yourself permission to
edit/delete potentially illegal messages.  If you want to be able to also
edit/delete other messages (i.e., ones that are tasteless, or irrelevant to
the current flow of conversation, or repetitive, etc.), modify the
disclaimer to include this.  Also, feel free to adjust the disclaimer for
other specifics to your board.



Dear EFF,
Is there an easy way for a sysop to recognize copyrighted GIFs that should
not be online?  I've had a couple I KNEW could not be kept in a BBS
collection, but with the enormous numbers of GIFs available....
Joyce


Hi Joyce.
The simple answer to your question is no.  Unfortunately, it is often
difficult for a sysop to know if something on his or her board is illegal.
The sysop's best bet is to contact the person making the upload if there is
any question.

Incidently, it is very unlikely that a sysop would ever be held liable for
something on his or her board that was not obviously illegal, unless there
was some reason the sysop should have suspected illegal activity and did
nothing to avoid it.  In the recent case where Playboy sued a sysop for
carrying copyrighted GIF files on his board, Playboy had given him notice
and had requested that he remove the illegal files before filing suit.
(The Playboy case was settled out of court.)

                  ROUTED NETMAIL PRIVACY
                     Jim Cannell 1:216/21

Since its humble beginnings in 1984, FidoNet has enabled people over
the entire world to communicate inexpensively and reliably.  Today,
it is almost routine for a message to be delivered anywhere in the
world in 24 - 48 hours at a very low cost.  Yet, for all this speed
and low cost, one very important thing has had to be sacrificed ---
privacy.  A copy of the message exists on each and every system that
the message is routed through, available for the sysop and possibly
others to read.

FidoNews 9-49                  Page 4                       7 Dec 1992


Now with the advent of low cost public key cryptography, messages
that are readable only by the sender and recipient are available to
almost anyone.  PGP 2.0 is a freeware package that is widely avail-
able that will allow you to sign/encrypt messages.  You can hide the
message from prying eyes, verify that you really did write it, or
both.

Unfortunately, Policy4, among its many other problems, defines the
routing of encrypted mail through other systems as annoying behavior,
unless the sysop of the system agrees in advance.  Yet, routing of
NetMail is the main way of keeping costs down, and money in the
sysop's pocket instead of the phone company's.  Given the futility
of trying to change Policy4 at any time in the near future, several
systems are setting up a new routing structure within FidoNet called
SecureMail.

SecureMail systems have voluntarily agreed to forward *ALL* NetMail
being routed through their systems, regardless of the content of that
mail.  Now you can send that private note to your lover without
titillating every sysop along the way by putting it into the envelope
that PGP can generate for you.  Ultimately, it is planned to have a
SecureMail hub in every net and in every region that will forward
truly private mail at little or no cost to you.

To send a message (whether it is ciphertext or plaintext) through the
SecureMail system, all you have to do is sned it to the nearest
SecureMail hub.  It will then be routed through one or more regional
and/or net hubs and ultimately be delivered to the recipient's
system.

As yet, SecureMail does not have complete coverage in Zone 1.  We are
actively recruiting volunteers for Net and Regional hubs to help make
SecureMail a success.  Most importantly, we are looking for Regional
hubs in Regions 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, and 19, as well as zonegates for
Zones 2-6.  The current Region hubs are:

   Region 10  Jim Cannell        1:216/21
   Region 11  open
   Region 12  open
   Region 13  open
   Region 14  open
   Region 15  Dave Munhollon     1:128/86
   Region 16  open
   Region 17  Ted Rolle          1:105/36
   Region 18  Christopher Baker  1:374/14
   Region 19  open

If you would like to volunteer for this exciting venture, please
contact any of the above Region hubs via NetMail.

Some objections to encrypted mail have been raised.  Doesn't it open
the door to criminal traffic passing through your system?  Why should
honest people have anything to hide?  As a partial answer to these
objections, can you guarantee that criminal traffic is not already
passing through your system?  And yes, honest people do have some-
thing to hide --- from dishonest people.  Like it or not, of the over
FidoNews 9-49                  Page 5                       7 Dec 1992


15,000 sysops in FidoNet, some are dishonest.

This article is not to discuss the pros and cons of encrypted mail.
That discussion should properly take place in the PUBLIC_KEYS Echo,
SYSOP Echo, etc.  This article is to introduce SecureMail to those of
you who wish to send and receive private mail through FidoNet.  If
you are among those who feel uncomfortable with the idea of encrypted
mail, then don't handle it on your system.  You can still send
plaintext messages through the SecureMail system or use whatever
routing that you are currently using.

The SecureMail Routing Proposal follows.  Comments on this are
welcome, either in NetMail or the PUBLIC_KEYS Echo.


                SECUREMAIL ROUTING PROPOSAL

This is a proposal to set up a NetMail routing system in
FidoNet that will allow anyone using it to obtain the cost
benefits that routed mail provides, while maximizing the
security/privacy of the contents of that mail.  The
SecureMail routing network will consist entirely of FidoNet
systems whose sysops have voluntarily agreed to handle
encrypted/signed mail.

Note that SecureMail is a supplement to the existing NetMail
routing within FidoNet.  It is not an OtherNet; it operates
entirely within FidoNet.  SecureMail is for NetMail only.
It will not handle EchoMail, although some hubs within it
may handle EchoMail in addition.

The SecureMail systems will be considered carriers only, and
will not be responsible for the content of any traffic
routed through this network.

The following defines the systems that will comprise the
SecureMail network.

REGION HUB

There will be one routing hub in each FidoNet Region.  This
hub will be responsible for forwarding all NetMail to/from
nets and independent nodes in his region.  Mail to/from other
regions will be forwarded to/from other Region Hubs.

The Region Hub should also make an effort to recruit Net
Hubs in his Region.

NET HUB

There will be one routing hub in each Net.  This hub will
be responsible for forwarding all NetMail to/from other
nodes in his net and to/from the Region Hub.

FidoNews 9-49                  Page 6                       7 Dec 1992


All sysops who participate in SecureMail agree to:

1)  Not read or in any other way monitor the content of
    intransit mail.

2)  Forward all mail, regardless of content.

3)  Either return undeliverable mail to the sender or an
    explanation of why it could not be delivered.

4)  Encourage the routine use of public key encryption
    and/or signing of all mail.

5)  Not refuse mail to/from any node, unless the volume of
    traffic to/from that node causes excessive long distance
    telephone charges to the routing system.  In this case,
    the node with the large volume of traffic should be
    encouraged to use direct, rather than routed mail.

A nodelist flag will be used to identify the systems
participating in SecureMAil.  URSMH and UNSMH (Region and
Net SecureMail Hubs) are suggested.

Squeezing us Non-IBMers out of Fido again?
by Andrew Gray of 1:231/590

This is response to Joe Jared's article in last weeks FidoNews.
Thenew Squeeze-It may be great, but as I have mentioned in a past
FidoNews,what about us Non-IBMers?  I COULD whip out AmyArc (example
only) andcompress everything with that, then talk about it in a
newsletter sayinghow great it was and it wouldn't do you a bit of good
would it?  True, Idon't mind people say "A new archiver TUVWXYZ just
came out and its muchbetter and faster than ZYXWVUT (creative with
names, ain't I?)" butsaying that all the files on your board is now
restricted to IBMs only..No.Will you people please think of EVERYONE,
not just one group?  True mytitle may be harsh, but it may eventually
come to this... Until sourceis publicly availible, I don't like the
idea of a new compressor beingused by FidoNet.

Without attempting to continue the generation of an endless number of
these types of articles, I wanted to respond with a big "Attaboy!" to
Roland Gautschi for an actual attempt at a vastly shortened (and
comprehensible, even) POLICY*.DOC in FNEWS948.

I stayed out of FidoNet for years, simply because it scared me to
death.  Among other things, I was unable to gather enough information
as to what exactly would be required of me as a Fido node (how many
of you REALLY got all of that out of the existing POLICY4?).  After
finally collecting everything that I needed, it wasn't nearly as bad
as many non-Fido SysOps make it out to be.

Wouldn't it be nice to have something short and sweet like that in
hand when trying to convince a fellow SysOp to join the net?

Personal opinion:

Although Roland's proposal was a bit on the skimpy side (even for
me), the combination of the basics of that proposal, and an update to
the now-two-years-old NEWSYSOP.ARC draft would go a long way towards
actually having one central "information packet" on joining FidoNet.

Unless we really WANT to keep things as complex as possible, and
continue to scare perfectly reasonable people away...

And now, back your regularly-scheduled articles.

DuckNet: Asylum From Usual Network Politics

Are you tired of the same old people getting in power and staying in
power thanks to an outdated policy document? Isn't it about time a
network was founded with ideas and principles that at least give the
"grunt SysOps" a fighting chance? Isn't there some better way to run a
network besides letting the ZC pick the RCs and then in almost the
same breath, turning right back around and letting the RCs pick the
ZC? If you agree with the above, then keep on reading for more info
about DuckNet.

Actually, DuckNet isn't that new. We've been around since about June
of this year in some form, but network traffic has gone up and down.
While there are only 8 (yes, that's right, EIGHT) nodes in DuckNet
right now, and message traffic is nearly nonexistent, our goal is to
have at least ***100*** (one hundred) nodes by January 1993. A modest
goal, considering several alternative nets have reached this number.

It is fairly well known that a network's success depends partly upon
having enough nodes in it. The reverse is also true: successful
networks get more nodes. Sometimes people join a network just because
there are 17,000+ other SysOps in it! In order for this experiment (or
whatever the heck you want to call it) to succeed, someone's got to
join. That someone might be you. If you are interested, file request

Fidonet Node 106/449

We would like to take this opportunity to invite Desert Storm and any
other veteran holding a campaign ribbon to visit the In_Country Echo.
This echo is for veterans of any war, any conflict, any service and any
country.  We hope to be able to contact others whose experiences are
common to ours, but possibly from the otherside's viewpoint.  We are all
proud of our combat service and realize that it places us apart from
servicemen that may have served during our era; but whom may have not
earned a campaign ribbon.

We hope to make it a place that Combat Veterans can meet and maintain
that comeraderie that may be missing in civilian or military life.
Basically, to give us all a place where we can come to talk to people
that 95% of the time are going to understand exactly what we are trying
to say.  A place that is for the Combat Vet, not for his sister.

The Echo is moderated by Lefty Frizzell and Scott Summers.  Both of us are
veterans of the Vietnam Conflict.  Scott is one of the founders of the
Houston Foundation for Vietnam Veterans.  His son is a Saudi veteran...a
fact that Scott is doubly proud of.

The echo has been available regionally for quite awhile and on the back
bone for 3 months.  Come join us and talk over old times.  We may not
have all the answers to your problems either personal or with the VA.
However, we may know someone that does.

The echo is sponsored by the Houston Foundation for Vietnam Veterans in
Houston, Texas.  They have helped many veterans since their inception.
They may be able to help you if you have a problem.

Anyhow, welcome home guys.  Hope to see you In_Country.

Following the implementation of Operation Restore Hope, the U.S. and
U.N. mission to provide security for humanitarian aid to Somalia, a new
echomail conference has been started.  The tagname is ORH and it is now
available at 1:2613/333.

Important newswires regarding this mission will be posted, in addition
to general discussions about the mission and pertinent information
regarding the civilian and military personnel involved.

If you're interested in obtaining a feed for this conference, please
send FidoNet netmail to 1:2613/333 or an Internet message to
orh@rochgte.fidonet.org.

PC-MOS/386 echo, locally available right now !

So, what's PC-MOS supposed to be ? PC-MOS/386 is a DOS v5.00
compatible multitasking operating system which eventually does also
provide multiuser support. Also, this echo will also discuss other
products like PC-EMULINK, LanLink PRO and the gateway to Novell.

We have decided to create this echo to discuss problems, arising with
installations, problem reporting and all such stuff. We're also
working on getting this on the backbone as well so that anyone can
join in from his or her local NODE. This, however is still in the make
but we do like to hear if there are people willing to join this echo.
This will strenghten the idea that such an echo is indeed needed.

Currently, the echo is available locally at Arjen Schouten, 2:512/153
and also at Ken Levitt, 1:16/390. Any message will be crossposted to
keep the local echoes in sync.

The only requirements to join the echo is to be a bit on topic and
keep the general stuff which definitely do not belong there out, like
politics, bashing and so forth. Moderation is generally done at the
point where you insert the echo, e.g. at 1:16/390 by means of Ken
Levitt and 2:512/153 by means of me for this moment. When/If we're on
the backbone, we'll keep the moderation; after a few months, we could
vote for any moderator.

For joining the echo, just drop a NETMAIL note that you want to join in
and we'll setup the right stuff to let you poll.
Basically, anyone can join in for any information.

contact us at : Ken Levitt, 1:16/390 or Roeland Jansen, 2:512/153.1

The International RACISM Forum!
by Bernie Wilt at 1:114/169

The International RACISM Forum is becoming increasingly popular.
Many are pleased with the opportunity to tell us how they feel
about racial issues.  There is certainly much to be said, and
a great place to say it.

Why is there are booming echo on racism?  Because it is a very hot
topic - worldwide!  The subject of racism has been a difficult one
for many in which to share their thoughts and beliefs without the
unease of personal contact.

The International Racism Forum gives people of any color (race)
a place to address this issue with little or no inhibitions.  The
array of expression within this forum is increasingly colorful
and informative.

Racism is an issue of extreme importance to the health of any
civilization.  How people respond to the problems associated with
racism has an vital impact on society and its affairs.  Racism can
be found at the very heart of not a few historical events.

The International RACISM Forum guidelines are as follows:

                      RACISM FORUM GUIDELINES
                      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

The purpose of this forum is to provide a means of discussing the
topic of RACISM.  Newspapers, television news, and often personal
experiences, make us keenly aware of the fact that RACISM is alive
and well in today's society.  Many of us do not share our feelings
and opinions on the matter, because of various fears and/or
reservations.  The RACISM forum affords the opportunity to discuss
your feelings, ideas, beliefs, and emotions on racism without the
difficulty of personal contact.

There are guidelines that must be followed to maintain an
environment conducive to order:

1). This forum, RACISM, is specifically for the exchange of messages
    that relate directly to the topic of racism.  Please use NetMail
    or an appropriate forum for all other topics of discussion.

2). COMMERCIAL messages must be APPROVED prior to being posted in
    this forum.  If you have materials that you'd like to distribute,
    that relate to RACISM, feel free to forward them to the address
    below for consideration.  In the event your materials are
    approved, you may then present them in the forum.

3). Please use your REAL NAME when using this conference.  Handles
    and/or aliases are *not* allowed.  While names such as "Mr.
    PotatoHead" and "Dances With Dead Wolves" may be useful elsewhere,
    they are not expedient in the RACISM forum.

4). There are many different people of varied backgrounds that will
    frequent this forum, please conduct your communications in an
    appropriate manner.

    a). The following are unnecessary and unacceptable forms of
        discussion or expression for this forum:

        - Vulgar language (which includes substitution of letters
          with symbols that still convey the meaning; such as:
          me**age = message).

        - Flaming, instigating, threats, personal insults, or
FidoNews 9-49                  Page 12                      7 Dec 1992


          harassments (note: it is understood that debates may
          become intense at times; however they should not be
          malicious).

        - Slang_racial_terms will not be allowed unless used
          indirectly within the body of a message for educational
          purposes.

5). It is not the purpose of this forum to give platform to racial
    supremacy groups, nor to harm race relations.  You are free to
    express your feelings and opinions, within the guidelines, but
    please give careful thought to what you share in this forum.

6). Off-topic discussion should not be posted in this forum.
    Please do not reply to any off-topic or inappropriate messages.
    If you wish to respond to these type of posts, please use NETMAIL.

7). This forum is owned and regulated by the moderator.  A network
    or system operator reserves the right to discontinue receiving
    the forum at any time.

8). Any problems encountered within the RACISM forum should be
    addressed to Bernie Wilt, via NETMAIL, at 27:814/0 or 1:114/169.

                   Thank you for your cooperation!
