========================================================================
     It seems that we had a snafu last week and issue seven
never went out.  No harm done, as there were no articles anyway.
However, all is fixed, and I am re-ticing issue seven, so you
should get two snoozes this week.

     This week's issue is quite short as well.  Where are the
articles?

Letter to the editor
From: Jayson Cowan (1:140/112)

  I am sending this letter to adress a concern I have had as of
late. I am a sysop in net140. I have also decided to operate and
pick up my mail myself within that net. The sysops within that
net have organized a netmail system where you can pay a fee have
have many backbone echos made available to you.

  Well I decided I didn't want to become a part of that system
because of that I was excluded from being able to recieve ANY
local (non long distance echos) available to net140. I felt
that was unreasonable but I wasn't going to fight Ken Read and
his boys about that. I figured so what. But reciently they have
removed my node completely saying that no one could connect with
me.

  That is a complete falicy. I have been running my BBS for 5
years now and have only taken my BBS down 2 in that time for
maintenance.  Well in September I took it down to fix things up
and they took that opertunity to remove my node. Ken Read has
been net140 coordinator for a very long time and I remember
periods when I could contact his system. I see his system is
still up.  I realy dislike always being treated like a second
class node just because I don't want to be apart of net140's
backbone system. Is there anything I can do about that?

FidoNews 1305 & 1306

by Fredrik Bennison
2:205/300, d93fbe@blg.du.se

After reading FidoNews issues 1305 and 1306, I felt sad that
FidoNet had sunk yet another notch down into the treacherous
waters of foul-mouthed flaming in that, I hesitate to call it
article, by C.I.A.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr. Juda on
behalf of all FidoNet sysops, for the service that he has
provided for years, and express a hope that someone or a group
of someones will step in and take the place of fidonet.org.

I'm also saddened by the gloomy future depicted by Mr. Hass,
although I can't say that I agree with it. I still prefer
Fidonet Echomail to Usenet News any day of the week, as it is
much more personal and friendly.

I believe that Fidonet still has a lot to give, at least it does
for me.
