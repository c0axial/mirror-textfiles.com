     FidoNet  and  Alternet  have   agreed  in  principal  to  jointly
     establish an official communications gateway.  While the zonegate
     mechanism may not be  the most desirable method,  it is never the
     less   one   which   existing   software   can   support  without
     modification.  Therefore,  zonegates connecting  the two networks
     will be installed in the respective nodelists effective September
     16th.

     FidoNet  and Alternet  have further  agreed  to jointly  define a
     specification for a more appropriate interconnection mechanism.

     This agreement was arrived  at through meetings between officials
     of  the  two  networks.   It  is  a  technical  agreement,  not a
     political one.  Each network believes that its interests can best
     be served by facilitating communication and encouraging technical
     cooperation.

     I am a  Pagan. This  is  my  humble  opinion  only, and  does not
     relect in any way anyone elses  opinion, including  the editor of
     Fido News, or  any group  other than me, myself,  and I. They are
     NOT the opinions of the author of the Christian Hate Series.

     Hi!   I  would  like to mimic, perhaps at the expense of sounding
     argumentive, the concern some have expressed       regarding  the
     Christian Hate  Series.  Some have said that such a project shows
     those who would condemn us that we are  truly  out  to  get  them
     after  all,  and  thus  their exertions against us are justified.
     Still  others  opinion  that  such  a  collection  of   religious
     intolerances  is  valueless  because  those who follow such Paths
     care little for what we think of them (save that we fear them  in
     some cases).  And still more could say that the Series is nothing
     more  than  name-calling, though since the files are for the most
     part written by those who wish individual thought and  expression
     ill, this stance I cannot see being a valid one.

     I spent may hours going through the collection, and my mind reels
     with the vast fusion of incredulity, disbelief, grief, and, above
     all, a  great deal of, well, staggering disappointment.  What has
     happened to the basic, mortal, human capacity for compassion  and
     courtesy?  I  read  and  am dismayed!  Such base, malignant hate,
     fear, and contriving force pointed, aimed, like a pistol  at  the
     heart of all that should, must, be held inviolate!

     The  hate  that  darkens  the mind and makes it slave to Despite.
     Worse, the cancerous growth of such execrate  grows  deep  within
     those  who  are  powerless  to beat against such strong a wind as
     religious intolerance, growing there like a child  got  by  rape,
     deep within  their  belly.  They have no idea they've been sorely
     violated by those who would use them, like the  pawns  they  are,
     for their own ends.

     I feel  powerless, impotent, in the face of such ignorance.  I do
     fear. . . greatly fear. . . that  the  battle  is  already  lost.
     Such  ill  Power  walks unhindered, untouched, through our towns,
     cities, and even our own hearts, and we must keep silent  or  get
     stepped on. Panic  threatens to  choke me, vowing  pain and grief
     in the place of resolution.

     I think  of  what  we could      become.  As human beings, we are
     capable of so much love, warmth,  passion,  affection.    Then  I
     think of what we might allow us to become.  And I weep.

     If nothing more, the Christain Hate Series  has pointed out to me
     that what we value most can  so easily be rended from us. This is
     why I feel this  Series has value.  It seeks  not  to call Others
     Than Us nasty names. It does  not demand Others Than  Us to treat
     us with the respect due  any thinking, living,  being-- To demand
     that which is already ours by Right. It's basic Function, rather,
     is to hold up and display, to all who would  see, the Great Enemy
     that faces not only us, but the very  same people  who would take
     from us the freedom  to choose,  think, be,  and  become, what we
     would, unfettered by constraints of what others would have us be.

                        To Disassemble The Machine

                              Fredric L. Rice
                                (103/503.3)

     Quite  a  few  of us consider nuclear war a high possibility
     and pause to consider its ramifications; the consensus seems
     to indicate a desire to  be  among  the  first  few  hundred
     millions to vaporize into a whiff of carbon and not a little
     ozone when the big ones start dropping.

     These  considerations  should, however, be set onto the back
     burner for now and  replaced  with  yet  another,  and  more
     probable threat.   The threat of a large quake along the San
     Andreas fault line.  Such a quake, being  on  the  order  of
     some  8.25  magnitude,  has  the same destructive power of a
     fifty megaton  nuclear  bomb.    Though   50   megatons   is
     considered  a  pony  bomb  by today's standards, it is still
     enough to stop California's commerce, and hence  livability,
     cold for years.

     Yet  this threat, and those that arise from its realization,
     are not taken seriously except by those insurance  companies
     and   engineering  firms  who  make  it  their  business  to
     understand and determine  the  risk  to  hopefully  minimize
     damage and  fatalities.    One  of  these  businesses is the
     nuclear power  plant  manufactures;  manufacturers  such  as
     General Electric and Westinghouse.

     Strain  along  the  infamous  San  Andrea  fault line can be
     measured with accuracy by automated equipment.  As pressures
     increase or decrease, the  direction  of  movement  and  the
     amount   of   built-up  pressure  is  radioed  to  receiving
     equipment and examined  by  computer  and  human  alike  for
     indications on the possibility of a destructive release.

     Recent  readings  show areas of the fault to contain some 36
     feet of stress, ranging through Palmsprings,  Palmdale,  and
     Lancaster.  Other areas of the fault contain much more while
     others show much less; on the average of some 15 feet or so.

     In  1857  there  was a fling along the San Bernadino line of
     the San  Andreas  fault  of  13  feet.    This  caused  much
     destruction and  loss  of  life.  If the fault were to break
     loose today, releasing even a minute amount  of  the  strain
     along its length, the 8 point or greater quake would occur.

     In  the  event of an 8.25 quake occurring on the San Andreas
     fault line, there would be anywhere from three  thousand  to
     fourteen thousand  people  killed.  Hundreds of thousands of
     people would become homeless and  many  more  would  die  if
     national  assistance is slow to respond with medical aid and
     water.  In 1971, "Quake Proof" dams were  built  to  replace
     the  older  earth  dams that were in use around the Southern
     FidoNews 5-36                Page 5                    5 Sep 1988


     California area.  These dams are designed to retain water in
     the event of regional disaster such that little to no  water
     would be lost due to possible damage.

     It  is  the  water  ducts,  however, that are engineers main
     concern.   California  is  mostly  an  unlivable  wasteland,
     relying  on these water ducts for the irrigation of the huge
     sediment rich basins we live in.  In an 8 point  or  greater
     quake,  we  can  expect that two of the three ducts would be
     destroyed, bringing them down for six months or more.  These
     two ducts go deep under  ground  at  some  points  in  their
     journey  and  it's  likely  that those under ground passages
     would be sealed off, making repairs a  difficult;  even  for
     the  Army Core of Engineers who's assistance would be needed
     elsewhere.

     Fire is not thought to be a major hazard when  the  big  one
     occurs.  This is unless there are Santa Ana winds present in
     which case  fire  will be a real hazard.  The threat of fire
     was realize in the 1906 quake in San Francisco  where  fire,
     more than  the  quake, totally destroyed the city.  In times
     of high quake probability, fire departments  make  city-wide
     rounds,  checking  on  the  availability  of water dumps and
     tanks.  The amount of water available for  use  in  fighting
     fires  are correlated into a series of maps which comprise a
     earthquake contigency plan.

     It's somewhat comforting to note that many  hospitals,  even
     fairly  minor  ones,  maintain  their  own  source  of power
     generators, fuel, and water.    I  know  that  the  city  of
     Glendoras  "Foothill  Presbyterian  Hospital" maintain power
     generators  that  switch  over  automatically  when   ground
     movement is  first  detected.  This "seismic trip" assures a
     structured cross-over from the external power grid to a safe
     internally contained power source, allowing the  surgeon  to
     use her operating equipment without interruption.

     The  need for self contained power systems in the event of a
     quake is readily apparent when you consider where it is that
     power comes from.  I might also note that a secondary source
     of fresh water comes from the same place.

     There are a bewildering number of  nuclear  reactors  strung
     along the  California  coast  line.   The placement of these
     piles are dictated  by  their  needs  for  huge  amounts  of
     cooling  water  though  in  a very few years this need is to
     change somewhat.

     Currently, water is drawn into the  nuclear  system  through
     underground  pipes  that usually contain a series of filters
     to remove the unwanted plants, silt, and marine  life  which
     might make it to the reactors intake.

     This  water  is  brought  to the pile core and is circulated
     around the fuel rods, (usually  Zirconium  Allow  cladding),
     which  are  at high temperature, causing the water to expand
     FidoNews 5-36                Page 6                    5 Sep 1988


     into steam.  This steam is drawn off of the  core  to  drive
     turbofans which  turn the electric generators.  The steam is
     usually brought to condensers  and  then  released,  warmed,
     back into  the  ocean.  I should also note that if there are
     breakages in the fuel  rod  cladding,  a  large  amount  and
     variety  of  fission by-products are released into the water
     and hence will be released into the ocean  only  miles  from
     our shores, (Zirconium alloy, Zircalloy, has its problems as
     does   steel   and  most  metals  when  subjected  to  harsh
     radiations, pressure, and heat over  periods  of  time,  and
     breakage is often cause for expensive replacements.  Because
     of  the  cost,  however,  the  Atomic Energy Commission will
     allow leaky fuel rods to remain in operation until  the  rad
     count rises  to  well  beyond  the  legal limit.  Not health
     limit; any release of radiation is a health hazard).

     The result is a lot of power and, if the condensed steam  is
     retained,  fresh water; water and power both badly needed by
     Californians.  This need for water will place nuclear  piles
     very  close to the coast line to reduce water transportation
     costs.  There is under development, and even  in  operation,
     liquid metal  cooled  nuclear  reactors.  The "sodium cooled
     reactors" represent perhaps a  greater  threat  to  life  in
     California than  the  threat  of  nuclear war.  Situated far
     from water sources  because  there  is  no  great  need  for
     cooling  water  and  land  is  cheaper,  these  reactors are
     brought as close to the cities as economically  feasible  to
     bring power  transmission  costs  down.    Without a back-up
     source of water to cool them in  the  event  of  a  loss  of
     coolant  accident,  (LOCA), some fairly elaborate schemes to
     contain the explosions are developed, (the usual containment
     vessel is not enough when dealing with liquid sodium  as  it
     reacts violently with both water and air).

     Most  people agree that nuclear reactors are unsafe, except,
     of course, those of the power companies themselves.   We  in
     California  have our share of them and it has been seen that
     California coats line is the worst place to put them.

     A LOCA, such as the  case  of  Three  Mile  Island,  can  be
     disastrous.   In  that event, a stuck-open pourve, (sp), was
     the initial cause for the environmental hazard alert  issued
     throughout the  plant.   It was the technicians lack skills,
     then, after the problem was started that cause much  of  the
     concern.  Dealing with a stuck open valve was commonplace in
     simulations;  the understanding of the cause for the reactor
     scram under actual conditions was absent.

     In this LOCA, during the investigation that took place after
     the scram, NRA officers asked one of  the  technicians  what
     would  have happened if the pile had been allowed to operate
     uncovered for a minute or two more than it did.

     "It would have disassembled the machine",  was  his  answer,
     meaning a nuclear explosion of course.

     FidoNews 5-36                Page 7                    5 Sep 1988


     This  type  of  accident,  those  where  human operators are
     controlling the system, can be disastrous.    When  a  quake
     breaks  open  the containment environment of a nuclear pile,
     however, the result can be much worse.   Pipes  which  bring
     the  coolant in, though usually designed for redundancy, can
     be severed causing an automatic reactor scram.   There  have
     been  some  indications  that  during  a seismic event, some
     reactors have been designed to shut down at the onset.   The
     reason  this is not too desirable a trait in a nuclear power
     plant is, of course, one of expense.  It is cost  which  was
     and  remains  the  overriding  concern  of  businesses,  not
     safety.

     When reactor manufactures which to make application for  the
     building  of  a  nuclear  power  plant, their engineers must
     submit a "maximum  hazard  summary  report"  to  the  Atomic
     Energy Commission,  (AEC).    Some of these, (and they are a
     matter for public record in some states), are truthful while
     most of them describe no loss of life in  the  event  of  an
     earthquake; trusting on the redundancy of multiply-backed-up
     subsystems and elaborate designed tailored to containment of
     the explosion in the event all else fails.

     It has always been a good idea to accept everything you read
     about  nuclear  power  plants  to  be  biased one way or the
     other.  Indeed, you might have noticed a  slightly  negative
     bent within  this  article.    Considering this, I'd like to
     detail an event which
      could occur at the San Onofre power plant which would by no
     means be typical.  It is, however, plausible.   This  didn't
     happen.

     On  the  morning of May 17'th, 1987, scientist at the United
     States Geological  Survey  team  in  Pasadena  detect  minor
     quakes ranged along the southern sections of the San Andreas
     fault   line,   affecting  San  Diego,  Carlsbad,  and  Camp
     Pendelton.  From some 250 pressure monitors along the  fault
     come pressure  readings  which  are  rising  quickly.  Argon
     levels from wells quickly rise as water levels drop in  some
     parts of  the  state  and  rises  in  others.   From the Los
     Angeles area down to San  Diego,  ion  counts  pick  up  and
     within minutes have doubled.

     The  USGS  and  other  authorities  are  faced  with a moral
     decision that may affect  the  population  of  the  Southern
     California   area:  the  may  report  the  heightened  quake
     condition and bring the civil defence and  fire  departments
     of  the  area  to an alert condition two, or they may choose
     not to say anything.  In their past decisions, problems have
     arisen from BOTH sides of the coin.  When alerts  reach  the
     public  and  nothing  happens,  authorities are flooded with
     complaints.  When damage occurs and loss of life is realized
     when people are not alerted, it brings cries  of  "what  are
     you people being paid for?" from the populace.

     As  the  morning  progresses and all indications strengthen,
     FidoNews 5-36                Page 8                    5 Sep 1988


     authorities make the decision not to alert the  news  medias
     but  to  bring  fire  departments  and national guardsmen to
     alert con 3.  At firehouses throughout the cities  affected,
     water availability is tabulated as is medical supplies and a
     condition of  readiness  is ascertained.  The National Guard
     alerts its commanding officers to wait for  possible  ground
     movement  and  are  told  of the most likely location of the
     zone of fling.

     Nothing happens during the working  day  of  May  17'th  and
     pressure monitors  have  stabilized at high levels.  Towards
     the evening, they start to drop slightly and by morning have
     dropped a few points.

     -  -  Authors  note:   These   pressure   readings,   random
     measurements,  well  water  depth, and ion counters are real
     and information obtained from them are radioed  through  the
     Ham Radio  community  of  the Southern California area.  The
     signature which often precursor quake activity  show  steady
     increase, a leveling off, two or three days of slow decline,
     and then  a  quake.    Graphs  of the pressure readings show
     signatures which can be used by the Ham Radio  community  to
     indicate an alert condition.

     On  the  morning of the 18'th, at 3:28 local time, a section
     of the San Andreas fault line breaks off, flinging  the  two
     opposing plates fifteen feet along each side.  The result is
     a  7.6  magnitude  quake  which  is  centered six miles from
     Carlsbad.  The epicenter is some six miles from Carlsbad and
     much damage is encountered there.  Over two thousand  people
     are homeless  and  the  fatality count starts at 137.  Their
     problems aren't over with yet, as unknown to them,  not  far
     away, a reactor is having problems of its own.

     At  Camp  Pendelton,  marines are awakened to the rocking of
     their barracks and not a few are knocked to the floor.    As
     the  ground  swells  roll  through the camp, the water tower
     breaks at the base and crashes down on  the  officers  mess,
     killing three  and  injuring another dozen.  Along the camps
     western side, the sea reacts  violently  to  the  quake  and
     fifteen  foot  swells  travel  along the coast line and swim
     away out to sea.  A helicopter which  was  landing  suddenly
     finds  the ground rocking and thinks there's something wrong
     with the helicopters landing gear.  As  he  lifts  off,  the
     ground  quivers  again tipping the craft slightly; hovering,
     the pilot radios for a visual check of  his  landing  struts
     but  will have to wait; the flight control tower operator is
     sitting on the floor waiting for the small stubby  tower  to
     stop shaking.

     Throughout  the Southern California area, various degrees of
     ground movements are recorded.  Along the Foothills  of  San
     Bernadino,  the  ground  waves  bounce off the mountains and
     head back to give those communities which are at its base  a
     second treatment  to the quake, prolonging the quake.  There
     is major damage ten miles from the epicenter,  minor  damage
     FidoNews 5-36                Page 9                    5 Sep 1988


     thirty  miles away, and noticeable ground movement up to one
     hundred miles away.

     And at the San Onofre power plant, the extent of the  damage
     is still to be noticed.  During the quake, sensors along the
     property  lines  pick  up  the  sonic waves that precede the
     quake and alert the automated equipment just seconds  before
     the ground  waves.    Under  the  reactors  water intake and
     purification building,  several  pipes  break,  causing  the
     dumping of water being pumped in from the sea.  As the pumps
     are  automatically  brought off line, air makes its way into
     the intake system and is churned into  the  water  oxidizing
     it.   The  broken  pipe is sealed from the reactor and pumps
     are brought up on secondary intake pipes.

     During the first ten seconds of the quake, the reactor  site
     is still  completely  intact.    The  broken pipes have been
     bypassed and the backups have  been  taken  on  line.    The
     monitoring  operator who is even now on his knees beside his
     bed pulling a shirt on with one hand and  steadying  himself
     with  the  other, quickly tries to get dressed to make it to
     the control room.  Other operators who are on duty and watch
     over the automated system are still frozen, waiting for  the
     quake to stop.

     As  the  first  few  large  swells pass within the first ten
     seconds, smaller swells come through the reactor site,  rise
     in intensity,  and  then resume their strength.  The aerated
     water condenses in the reactor circulatory  system,  causing
     an air  bubble to be loosed through the pumps.  As the water
     alternately compresses and rarefies  the  trapped  air,  the
     pipes  internal  to  the reactor building start to cavitate,
     thudding the twenty ton pipe fittings against  the  concrete
     floors and walls.  The reactor is in a state of scram due to
     the  intensity  of the quake but has not been fast enough to
     stop what comes next.

     As the final ground swells sweep through the site, the  pipe
     fittings  deep  within  the reactor core housing cracks open
     and widens before the air is purged through this crack.   As
     the pipe stop jumping, the hot water spurts into the reactor
     housing  and  turns  to  steam, releasing much heat into the
     building.

     The reactor operators hear the environmental hazard  warning
     horns  blaring  through  out the site as they make it to the
     control room  and  cycle  themselves  through  the  security
     devices.   Even  as  they  enter  the  room one by one or in
     pairs, they are looking at and evaluating the  rash  of  red
     actuators  ranged  along  three  of the walls, trying to see
     where the damage is and what  the  automated  equipment  has
     done,  what should be done, and what the automated equipment
     should not have done.   They  quickly  notice  the  reactors
     automated  systems  have  inserted  the quick-drop dampening
     rods into the core and that the slower-dropping rods are all
     on the way down.  Unknown to them, however, is the fact that
     FidoNews 5-36                Page 10                   5 Sep 1988


     the intake water is no  longer  circulating  throughout  the
     reactor  and  that  water  existing  in  the system is being
     forced out as the temperature rises through several valves.

     Seven  minutes  after  the  quake,  the  first  signs   that
     something really  wrong is taking place is realized.  As the
     dampening rods hit bottom and reactor temperatures  in  some
     areas  of the core continue to rise, it's realized that some
     of the fuel rods have been exposed and have melted  into  an
     unstable configuration.    There  are hasty conclusions made
     which attempt to find why the reactor was uncovered and it's
     cause is quickly observed by camera.  Though the picture  is
     wet  and  steamed,  a picture into the reactor housing shows
     deep water on the  floor;  more  water  than  the  emergency
     drains can expel safely.

     At  5:00  on  the morning of May the 18'th, all nonessential
     personnel are ordered off  the  site  and  the  governor  is
     alerted to  a  possible  disaster at the San Onofre site.  A
     quick description of the  problem  is  enough  to  make  the
     governor  declare  a  quiet state of emergency and a call to
     the  USGS  to  ascertain  the  possibility  of  aftershocks.
     Though   pressure   readings   dropped   to   all-time  lows
     immediately after  the  quake,  they  are  rising  again  at
     exponential rates.   The possibility of aftershocks are very
     high.

     At the site, several hydrogen explosions are recorded  under
     the pressure  dome  over  the  reactor core.  Air inside the
     core is heated and compressed past the flash point  and  the
     thousand  ton  dome  bounces  eighteen  inches into the air,
     landing flat in its suspension pool.  The record shows  this
     may have happened four or five times, no one who remained at
     the  site  could  agree  on  the  readings, before the final
     explosion.

     Attempts are made to cool the reactor by using  high  volume
     sprays set into the containment dome.  When brought on line,
     however,  all  fail to work because of the severing of their
     feed lines when the containment moved.    Emergency  coolant
     has  been  pumped into the reactor core but not all parts of
     the core are accessible due  to  its  melted  configuration;
     some areas are quite cold while others are molten.

     At  5:27,  a  reactor operator sees something that makes him
     leave the control  room  unauthorized.    The  operator  has
     viewed molten uranium dripping from a crack in the core onto
     the concrete  floor.  As the operator hops into his American
     Made car an operator monitors  the  reactor's  progress,  at
     exactly  5:30  am,  the reactor disassembles itself, seeding
     all those within three miles with am  immediate  and  lethal
     dose of  harsh  gamma  radiation.    As the containment dome
     comes back down the twenty five feet it has risen,  it  does
     so at an angle, making it crash and fragment upon the top of
     the reactor  housing.    Much of the tonnage holds the heavy
     particles of the lethal radiation in but still a lot escapes
     FidoNews 5-36                Page 11                   5 Sep 1988


     in the form of liquid  products,  gas  products,  and  solid
     products borne on the winds and shrewn into the air.

     Up  to  twenty-five miles away, people in such places as San
     Diego, Camp Pendelton, and Carlsbad  are  treated  to  heavy
     doses of  quick and dirty gamma particles.  The slower betas
     hammer through the cities causing burning  and  bruising  of
     flesh.   This  flesh  will  never  heal; the cells have been
     traumatized into forming cancer cells by the destruction  of
     their DNA  molecules.    Many cancer deaths will be recorded
     this year and those that follow for the remaining  years  of
     life for the survivors.

     For  up  to  1500  miles  from  the  site,  dangerously high
     readings of radiation is encountered in the soil  which  the
     cattle graze on and which the people of Los Angeles walk on,
     play baseball  on,  and  generally  live  on.    It can't be
     scrubbed from the air, scraped from  the  ground,  or  taken
     from  the bones of the animals we eat, or from the leaves of
     the plants we eat.

     The  explosion  has  blown  the  reactor  fuels  into   many
     non-critical  fragments,  much  of which sits at the base of
     the core melted and then reformed along a shallow pyramid of
     zirconium.  This pyramid insures that if a melt down occurs,
     the reforming of the molten uranium will not freeze  into  a
     critical mass  and  cause  a  small nuclear detonation.  Its
     likely to remain in this condition for many years  to  come.
     It  may even remain so for hundreds of years after engineers
     decide to simply cover the thing with  concrete  and  forget
     about it.

     Even  a  "minor"  quake  like  the  one  described above can
     rupture a reactor.  In this hypothetical example, it  wasn't
     the  actual  quake  which  triggered  the destruction of the
     containment but its effects.  In the quake Californians  are
     expecting,  an  8.25  or  more,  the  quake will be over one
     hundred times stronger than a 7 point quake.

     It's  also  important  to  note  why  radiation  causes  the
     problems it does.

     When  an  atomic  particle passes through your body, it will
     encounter many cells by colliding violently with them.   The
     molecules  within  the  cell have, as you know, electrons in
     orbit around a nucleus.  If  the  atomic  particle  hits  an
     electron,  it  may strip it away from its orbit, causing the
     molecule to become ionized.  If the atomic particle hits the
     nucleus, it can break that atom into  its  parts;  neutrons,
     protons, and  electrons.    Some times the cell may recover.
     Most of the times, however, the cell dies.

     It is when a cell recovers where the problem starts.  A cell
     that has been traumatized in such a manor may have  had  its
     FidoNews 5-36                Page 12                   5 Sep 1988


     DNA code  altered  by  the  collision.    In  this case, its
     reproduction facilities may or may not work.  If  not,  then
     the  cell becomes cancerous and is slowly or quickly removed
     from the organ depending on where it occurs in the body.  If
     the reproduction facilities are intact, then the  cell  goes
     onto  rebuilding  many  copies  of  its  altered self, using
     materials which surround the altered cell.

     A dose of radiation may not cause immediate damage.  When an
     atomic particle enters an object,  it  may  become  imbedded
     within it.   Certainly plant life collects such radiation in
     this way.  When a large  area  of  radiated  plant  life  is
     eatten by an animal, the accumulated radiation is compressed
     into  neat  little  packets  which are further compressed by
     other animals and also dispersed by still others.

     In the event of a particle becoming lodged in a human  bone,
     it may well stay their for thirty years before it decides to
     decay and release a ray.  This ray proceeds out of the human
     body crashing its way through and ionizing a trail of flesh.

     What  can be done about nuclear power by the general public?
     Nothing.  We are stuck with it because  of  the  demand  for
     more  and  more power and water than does not tie us tighter
     with unfriendly nations.  If the public was willing  to  pay
     greatly  for  their  power  and  fresh  water, nuclear power
     plants could be made safe and clean.  As it is, however,  we
     are not  yet  ready  to  pay the price financially.  We are,
     however, willing to pay the price in other,  less  civilized
     ways.

     I know, I know, backup my hard disk.  There are all  sorts of
     great  reasons  to  do  it  and every issue of every computer
     magazine  contains   at   least   one   article,   column  or
     advertisement plucking on the ol' guilt string.  But have you
     tried backing up with DOS?  It's a royal pain in the big toe.

     Sure,  there  are  backup  tape systems, Bernoulli boxes, and
     other high tech alternatives.  But  these gems  are expensive
     so I don't have of these convenient devices.

     So I procrastinate, quickly flip past the "have you backed up
     today?" stuff in the  magazines, and  swear to  myself that I
     will indeed backup . . . someday.

     But my guilt complex has become almost unbearable.  So it was
     with great interest -- and relief -- that  I had  a chance to
     try  out  Fast  Back  Plus by Fifth Generation Systems, Inc..
     This program has received good marks  from most  of the major
     computer magazines and is available for under $100.

     The  documentation  is  very  readable,  well  organized  and
     instructive.    The   menuing   system   combined   with  the
     context-sensitive help makes the use of this program so easy,
     however, that you really don't have to resort to the manual.

     Three user levels are selectable:  beginner, experienced, and
     advanced.   The higher the user level, the greater the number
     of options available; conversely,  the help  screens are more
     detailed as you lower the user level.

     In addition  to a  "Full Backup",  you can choose "Full Copy"
     (make a copy of  your  backup  without  changing  the archive
     bit), "Differential"  (backup of files changed since the last
     full backup),  and  "Incremental"  (backup  of  files changed
     since the  last incremental  backup).  You may also select or
     deselect subdirectories and files for backup purposes.

     You do not need to have formatted disks  on hand.   Fast Back
     Plus will  do the formatting for you, although this will take
     FidoNews 5-36                Page 14                   5 Sep 1988


     some additional time.  This is  a nice  feature, particularly
     for those  of us  who have  had to abort a lengthy DOS backup
     because we have discovered towards the end of the backup that
     we do  not have  any more  formatted floppies.   It also will
     reject floppy disks with bad  sectors  --  a  real confidence
     booster.

     More  than  one  drive  can be designated and different drive
     formats are accommodated.  If you have two  disk drives, this
     will considerably  speed up  your backup since Fast Back Plus
     does not have to wait for you to  change floppies  -- it will
     backup on  one drive, while you change the floppy disk on the
     other.

     Fast Back Plus contains some  truly  helpful  features.   For
     example, it  offers data  compression.  You can either choose
     to "save time" or  "save  disks".    The  "save  time" option
     compresses  data  during  idle  processor time.  On the other
     hand,  the  "save  disks"  option  takes   whatever  time  is
     necessary  to  compress  the  data  which, according to Fifth
     Generation Systems, Inc., can result  in  up  to  a  77% file
     compression.

     There  also  is  an  "Advanced  Error Correction System".  By
     writing extra correction information to disk,  Fast Back Plus
     can  recover  missing  data  should  the  disk  later  become
     damaged.  The manual  claims that  up to  13% damage  to disk
     surface can be tolerated, depending upon the media.

     A "Write Verify" option also is available.  This feature will
     cause Fast Back Plus to compare every byte of backed  up data
     with  every  byte  of  data  copied  from the hard disk.  The
     manual  observes   that   "this   option   provides  absolute
     certainty  as  to  the  integrity"  of the backup.  The cost,
     however, is that you will double your backup time.

     inally, Fast Back  Plus  has  a  powerful  macro capability.
     This can be accessed from within the program, itself, to save
     steps in using repetitive features.  You can also invoke this
     capability from  DOS, which will allow you to create a simple
     batch program to run a daily backup with ease.

     For my first run on Fast  Back Plus,  I decided  to backup my
     entire  hard  drive  with  the  exception  of  one particular
     directory  and  its  subdirectories   (it  was   very  large,
     contained  nonessential   information  and  programs,  and  I
     already had a backup).   The  "exclusion"  process  is fairly
     simple.   All I  had to  do was  ask for directory tree to be
     displayed  and  then  I  deselected  the   directory  by  the
     point-and-shoot method.

     On the other hand, it took quite some time for Fast Back Plus
     to read my disk before it  could present  the directory tree.
     Ordinarily I  would not complain but I had previously invoked
     a directory tree whie I was playing around  with some  of the
     program's features  and it  seems to  me that  Fast Back Plus
     FidoNews 5-36                Page 15                   5 Sep 1988


     should not have to take the time to  read the  disk more than
     once during  a session.   Fast  Back Plus's  need to read the
     hard disk each  time  you  want  a  directory  tree  could be
     tiresome if  you wanted  to first selectively include certain
     subdirectories/files      and      then      exclude     some
     subdirectories/files from that group.

     fter I made my backup deselection, I requested an "estimate"
     of the amount of time and floppy disks that would be required
     for my  backup session.  I was amazed at the speed with which
     Fast Back Plus presented me with this estimate.

     However, the estimate was  woefully inaccurate.   I  was told
     that 55  floppies would be required and that the backup would
     take 10:51 minutes.  In fact, I only used 28  floppies but it
     took  over  51  minutes  for  the  backup.   According to the
     Manual, the estimate "will  usually be  pretty close  [to the
     actual backup requirements], although the Time: may be longer
     if you  used unformatted  floppy disks,  or changed diskettes
     slowly."  However, my floppy disks were already formatted and
     I immediately changed diskettes -- long before Fast Back Plus
     finished writing to my other floppy disk drive.

     The estimate  also does  not reflect  the options  chosen.  I
     received exactly the same estimate when  I selected  the data
     compression option  ("Disk Save")  as when I did not select a
     data compression option.  Certainly the  estimate should take
     into account  the use  of options that will affect the number
     of floppies or the amount of time required for a backup.

     I was impressed by the data  compression "Disk  Save" option.
     Over 50  disks were  required when  I tried  a backup without
     selecting data compression.  As I mentioned earlier, with the
     "Disk Save" option, I only needed 28 floppies.

     Notwithstanding my criticisms, Fast Back Plus is easy to use,
     reliable, and economic.  So remember:  brush your teeth after
     every  meal,  never  take  candy  from a stranger, always say
     thank you and .  . .  never ever  forget to  backup your hard
     drive -- with Fast Back Plus!

                      Yet Another Complicated Komment

                            by Steven K. Hoskin
                        ( STEVE HOSKIN at 1:128/31 )

                      Episode 8:  The Joys of FidoNet

          Oh, I love FidoNet!

          As a veteran BBS user, I  just  love  the expanded abilities
     offered by FidoNet!  Boy!  I don't have to hunt around every time
     I move to find a good BBS.   One  where the users are polite, the
     SysOps are friendly,  the  conversations  are  good,  and once in
     awhile there's some good software  out  there to try, maybe keep.
     All I have to do is snag a  copy  of  the local NodeList before I
     move and get on a FidoNode when I get there!

          I've 'subscribed' to quite  a  few boards in my day, ranging
     from that old TRS-80  software  all  the  way  up to a Vax-driven
     system.  And there's been some real DEAD boards out there.  SysOp
     responses over a month's  worth  of  waiting;  users (have we got
     more than 10 yet?); message base (what's that?  Nobody _talks_ on
     a BBS?!) or message bases that resemble the Mojavah.

          Not anymore.  BBSs are getting  accepted, and the BBSaholics
     proliferate enough to make  it  easy  to find a board to talk on.
     And then along came EchoMail.

          EchoMail may  cause  the  majority  of  the  problems in the
     Network these days, but it  is  also  greatly responsible for the
     popularity of BBSs.   Perhaps  the  users  can't EXPLAIN why they
     like EchoMail, but if they could  explain it then I'd say they're
     probably not having fun at it -- they're rationalizing.

          I just LIKE echomail;  getting  to  converse  with people in
     this strange medium I've never met.  Oh, sure, now I am half of a
     software development company where having FidoNet access is nice.
     Sure, it gives us a place  to  show  off  our EagleTech software,
     especially our PD and shareware  utilities.  And these are better
     reasons than 'I like it',  but  they  are not the important ones.
     Just the  fact  that  I  look  forward  to  those  messages in my
     frequented echoes and that occasional NetMail message is the best
     reason to have it.  It's FUN.    No  whytos or whereabouts to it.
     It's just...plain...fun.

          Now I'm a SysOp; has this changed?  No.  What has?

          Well, for starters, now I  can  CHOOSE which Echos I wish to
     have access to.  I'm into  flying;  I  can  get into the National
     FLYING echo.  You don't find many  boards that support that.  And
     there's a little tingly  feeling  about  being  a SysOp.  I can't
     explain it.  But it's  there,  bigger  'n  life, and I for one am
     going to enjoy it.  Here's to you, FidoNet.  Thanks.
