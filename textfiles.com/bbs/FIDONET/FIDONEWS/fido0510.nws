     =================================================================

                          What's become of trust?

     It used  to be  you could trust what you read in EchoMail, not to
     mention FidoNews.  Everyone treated  FidoNet (and  it's users and
     sysops)  with  respect  and  decency.  If  you received a netmail
     message from someone, you  knew it  was legitimate.  Likewise, no
     one would  have thought of impersonating anyone in EchoMail. What
     brings all this up? Let me tell you...

     I thought it very  odd when  some messages  supposedly written by
     Thom  Henderson  popped  up  in  the sysop echomail conference. I
     thought it very odd because they didn't sound  like Thom, besides
     which I  was under  the impression  he was leaving FidoNet alone.
     Well, the other day I received a phone call at  work. Even though
     Thom is  now in AlterNet, we keep in touch. This was unusual only
     because I was the one who  usually placed  the call.  Thom's main
     reason for  the call  was to  find out if I had seen any messages
     from  him  in  the  sysop  echomail  conference.  After   a  long
     discussion with  Thom, I  am convinced  that he isn't the one who
     sent those messages. If  you've  received  a  nasty  message from
     Thom,  odds  are  you've  been  hit  by  someone  with a juvenile
     mentality and no respect for FidoNet.

     This is also the  case with  "Auntie Tyranny"  and NeuterNet. The
     person behind  these messages  doesn't understand that FidoNet is
     about communication and understanding.  All their  messages prove
     is  their  senders  immaturity.  FidoNet  has  to learn to ignore
     these type of messages. The  attention  given  to  bogus messages
     like this only serve to destroy FidoNet. The attention gives rise
     to mistrust and flames. This isn't  what Tom  Jennings envisioned
     with FidoNet.  This also isn't what most of us want to see happen
     in FidoNet.

     All in all, what happened to  the trust  I learned  in Alexandria
     last  August  at  FidoCon.  Is  that  spirit  of  cooperation and
     understanding still alive? How long will it take for us  to learn
     to work together instead of flaming at each other.


     Sadly,
     Your Editor

                     "You're More Than Your Physical Body"

             The   key  phrase  for  a  very  new, and needed bulletin
     board system dedicated to the New  Age  and   Occult   community.
     The    Astral  Plane  (r)  Online  is  a relatively new, yet very
     quickly upcoming BBS in  Linthicum,   Maryland.   The   board  is
     run by  the owners  of The  Astral Plane,  an Occult  and New Age
     store  also   found   in   Linthicum   which carries  hundreds of
     curios,  books,  herbs,  crystals,  and other items on this, very
     rapidly growing, area.

             The  main  interest for The Astral  Plane (TAP)  which is
     stated in our welcome messages is to "Provide  Information  On  A
     New  Age." there  are  a lot of  misguided and  hollywood created
     images on  Magick, Witchcraft,  and Psychic abilities that almost
     everyone has a different  idea and/or  opinion on  what it really
     is: Satan worship?  A  bunch  of frauds?  Some  crazy  people who
     don't know any better? Those are just some of the  thoughts about
     people who  are "into"   Magick,   Witchcraft,  and  New  Age and
     Psychic related areas of study. The sad part is that  many people
     havnt had the chance to actually, safely, find out what it is all
     about. Since there is a  good  and  bad  to   everything   it  is
     important   to   shift  through  and  find  out  what is and what
     isn't. Although, sometimes that becomes quite a task!

             To make sure  we  don't  lead  the  reader  to  the wrong
     impression,  TAP  is  not  only  for  the  New   Age  and  Occult
     community.   We    support  message    areas    and    U/Ds   for
     Commodore,  CoCo,  Apple,  IBM,  and  Atari computers and several
     echomails! See for  yourself  what  TAP   has   to offer,   we're
     pretty sure  that we  will have  something for  everyone and your
     suggestions are always  welcomed!  Call  us  at  301-768-7947  24

                              ---------------

     There  is  a  problem  in OPUS-CBCS (v1.03a) that can cause it to
     miscalculate events between 3/1/88 and 3/1/94.

     A "fix" is available  in  an  archive  called  OBUG_103.ARC.  The
     archive  contains  a 330 byte .COM file that will patch OPUS.EXE.
     When executed,  it will patch the system and set  a  new  version
     number (1.03b).

     Source code for the fix program is being  posted  in  the  MEADOW
     echomail area.

              The IEEE Port CD-ROM at 1:107/233  516-757-9469


          As of March 16th 1987, the entire PC-SIG  705 disk library
     of public-domain and shareware programs is on-line at the IEEE
     Port (1:107/233).  This has been done through the sponsorship of
     the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) which
     has provided a Philips CM 100 CD-ROM player and the PC-SIG Disks
     1-705 CD-ROM.

          We have established a somewhat convoluted procedure for
     gaining access to the over  700 directories on the PC-SIG CD-ROM
     disk.  This process is described below and is also readable on-
     line.

          The files listed below are file requestable 24hrs from
     1:107/233.  They are the ARCed Tables of Contents of the various
     disks.  Note that because all these files are ARCed you are
     required to first download each of them to your own disk and
     unARC them.  Once you have done this, you may search for
     occurrences of any particular string in the Tables of Contents
     with one of these commands:

                         DFIND "string"
                         FFIND "string" outfile.nam


          where "string" is the value for which you wish to search.
          DFIND will display the results directly on the screen,
          whereas FFIND will write the output of the search to a disk
          file which you may  subsequently search manually with  an
          editor or list program.

                   PC-SIG LIBRARY - Disk Access Procedure

          When you log on to the IEEE Port (300/1200/2400) (no pre-
     registration is required) type "F" from the main menu to get to
     the files area.  The procedure to select which particular disk is
     started in area 16 by typing "F".   You will be given a menu that
     looks like this:



      Enter   I - To get information on what files and programs are
                    available.
              D - To get information on addressing a particular disk
                    from the PC-SIG Library and then to select a disk.
              S - I've seen it all before, let's just select a disk!
              C - Explain the use of SEAlink protocol for downloading
                    a disk.

              Q - Quit.

     I highly recommend option "C" for those who do not use SEAlink in
     some form or another.  It will save you a lot of time and typing.

          Since you have the instructions here type "S" to select the
     disk you wish to DL from.  You will be prompted to enter the
     number of the PC-SIG disk you wish to access.  Type the numbers
     as three whole numbers (i.e.  to select disk 49 type "049").  You
     will then be informed that you selection has gone thru and to
     proceed to files area 99.  In order to actually the access the
     PC-SIG disk that you selected you will have to transfer to file
     area 99.  This area does not appear in the list of areas
     maintained by OPUS; that's OK, just use the A99 to go there
     anyway.  Area 99 area will be pointing to the PC-SIG disk you
     select.

          Before OPUS will let you in to area 99 you must enter the
     access code "PCSIG".  Although you won't be able to use the F(ile
     List) command here, you will be able to use the R(aw Directory)
     display to see the names of all the files on the selected disk.
     You may then download any file(s) as you normally would from any
     file area, the only difference being that you will be DLing from
     a subdirectory of the CD-ROM.

          Usually there is a file named DISK###.TXT on each PC-SIG
     disk so if you select disk 694, use the T(ype) command to list
     out DISK694.TXT and get a descriptive file listing of the
     selected disk.

          I run SEAdog 4.11 on top of Opus 1.03a on an original IBM XT
     with 2 ST 225s.  A Zoom Short 2400 baud modem (internal) and a
     Philips CM 100 CD-ROM Player.  If you have any questions or
     suggestions I am reachable at 1:107/233.

                      My Answer to "How do you write?"
                                David Rice
                                (103/503)

          I got  a  letter  in  the  mail.    Usually  I toss all mail
     received into the trash unexplored, which means that every  month
     when  the  bills  come I have to leave the state under an assumed
     name.  It's cheaper than paying my phone bill.  This letter  felt
     different somehow, so I decided to read it.

          "Dear Sir,"  it  began.    I  knew  immediately  trouble was
     creeping my way by the "Dear". "I read and enjoyed  your  article
     'Missing Socks  and the Rings of Saturn' very much.  I'm a writer
     too.  Would you share your method of writing with me?  Your  good
     friend, John."

          Tall order,  indeed!  I was tempted to throw the letter down
     the used food recycler (toilet), but after all, it did come  with
     a stamped, self addressed envelope.  I sat down and answered.

     My Dear, good friend John,

          This is how I write.


          Five in the morning.  Dragging my body from the floor mat, I
     grope weakly  for  the heater's "ON" button.  Why I do this every
     morning is a mystery, as the heater has never worked in  the  six
     months I've  been  living  here.   But I keep the faith, as hope,
     they say, springs eternal.  If I'm in a playful mood I also grope
     my roommate, which tends to heat the room almost as well (if  not
     better) than the wall heater would.

          Eyes   closed   against   the  feeble  light,  I  trip  over
     dictionaries, a thesaurus or two, "How to  be  a  Better  Lover",
     dirty jeans, the stack of "OMNI" magazines, and the speaker cords
     running away  from  the secondhand stereo.  I kicked the beer and
     soda cans against the wall the night before so I won't amputate a
     toe the next morning.  Usually (more often than not) I make it to
     my desk, where my jacket, also secondhand, is waiting for  me  on
     the chair I bought at a police auction.

          The desk is painted mustard yellow on top to hide the coffee
     stains,  grape  juice stains, pickle relish, pencil marks, blood,
     sweat, and battery acid.  Also, everything I eat has  mustard  on
     it,  so the desk must surely have mustard on it as well- But with
     all  the  papers,  books,  cups,  apple   cores,   condoms,   and
     payment-past-due notices, how can I tell?

          Flexing  my  fingers  against  the  cold,  I  hunt  for  the
     pre-write sheets I scrawled out the evening before.  I  recognize
     these  papers  from  the  rest by the notes in the margins: "This
     won't work! <arrow>", "Change this," "This stinks", "You CAN'T be
     serious!" etc.  Gathering up these choice pages, I proceed to the
     shower.  While in the shower I go through the pre-writes  of  the
     night before.    This  usually requires great dexterity and three
     FidoNews 5-10                Page 7                    7 Mar 1988


     arms, or great dexterity and the arm of a very good friend.

          Stepping out of the shower onto the  ice  covered  floor,  I
     wring out the sodden pages over the toilet, and start thinking of
     the actual writing (i.e. turning the pre-writes to writes).  I do
     this  all  in  my  head,  and tell myself to remember everything.
     Naked, I check out the refrigerator for  breakfast.    A  can  on
     olives  usually  does  the  trick,  or  a  can of diet soda and a
     carrot.

          Now I dress for work.  Rummaging around the  floor  for  the
     cleanness  dirty  underwear,  I  also find a miss-matched pair of
     socks, knot a tie tightly around my throat, and gun  my  Chrysler
     (secondhand Cordoba) to work.

          While  doing  my  mindless, thoughtless, menial task at work
     (no, not as an air traffic controller), I am writing in my  head.
     My  pre-writes  usually  lay open, drying out, on the desk before
     me, next  to  the  work  I'm  paid  to  do.    I  think  of  plot
     developments  and  dialog while at the same time working on Spare
     Parts History Reports for the Product Repair Center.

          This job allows me to send $660.00 a  month  to  my  bloated
     landlord,  who desperately needs it for his drugs, teenage tarts,
     and pornographic films.  Though I've never  been  late  with  the
     rent, my heater still remains a victim of neglect.

          Lunch time!   Now I write down everything I was plotting and
     dialog-ing when I should have been working.  I  use  a  sheet  of
     paper  and  pencil  for  this  rough  draft,  writing  as fast as
     possible (I get 30 minutes for lunch).

          By the time I've ran Lint through the  fish  market  to  his
     boat,  followed discreetly by The Silent One, lunch is half over.
     Finally, when I get Lint's boat blown out of  the  water  between
     Newport and Catalina, lunch is over.

          Back home!  Work was a drag, but I lived through it.  Dinner
     is  a  can of soup, with the lid coaxed off with a dull, worn-out
     opener.  I place the can directly on the  stove,  and  know  it's
     ready when the label is completely burned off.

          I  carry  the  hot can of soup to my desk, turn the computer
     on, and slop noodles on the stack of poems I've written and never
     sold.  Usually when this happens  I  just  put  another  pile  of
     papers  on  top  to sop up the stuff, but if I'm hungry I eat the
     noodles, poems and all.  Lately I've been hungry, so the desk  is
     cleaner than is normally the case.

          WRITING  STAGE!  (Tah dah!) I whip out my rough draft that I
     did at work and get it in the computer.  I never change  anything
     until this is  done  (i.e.  I don't rewrite the draft).  After it
     is in, and saved to disk, THEN I rewrite the draft into a write.

          Putting on a Wagnor Opera as background noise,  or  ABBA  if
     I'm  writing  about sex between teenagers, I mentally go over the
     FidoNews 5-10                Page 8                    7 Mar 1988


     next stages.

          From draft to write involves looking at what  I've  written,
     wondering if  I  like it, and changing it if I don't.  More often
     than not, I change it.  I take away padding that doesn't  belong,
     and add  meat  that does.  When that day's pre-writes, draft, and
     write is completed, my soup is also finished and I  get  a  warm,
     fuzzy feeling.    This  feeling usually goes away when I read the
     last few pages to check for continuity.  After all, I can't  very
     well  blow up Lint's boat when he'll be needing it for the harbor
     orgy Friday, can I? Or will he have to rent one?

          Or better yet, what if I give  Lint  a  broken  rib  from  a
     pounding  by  The  Silent  One  on  page 83, and have him playing
     football with the Upper New York State  University  for  Lesbians
     (UNYSUL) on page 85?  It just doesn't feel right.

          This done, I turn off the computer and rummage around for my
     outline book.   This is what I first wrote when I started "Lint's
     Luck", putting it in a lose leaf binder.  It's my road map that I
     loosely follow, though  Lint  often  goes  where  no  writer  has
     outlined before.    I check off the past pages, and see what's on
     the road ahead.

          What's up ahead is what I write my pre-write from.   Suppose
     Lint  is  on  his  kitchen floor, as in chapter eleven, under the
     sink working on the drain pipe.  That's where we  left  him  just
     before I  turned  the  computer  off and looked at my outline.  I
     know that next up is the cool, aloof  daughter  of  a  moderately
     well-to-do  business  man,  who walks in with a nasty pistol, and
     asks Lint why he killed her daddy.  My pre-write should  tell  me
     how  she stands, what Lint was doing the second she walks in, his
     first impression, what he was thinking, the position of his body,
     the color of her shoes.  The pre-write may go:

          "Looking up, Lint noticed a pair of pale green shoes. .
          ." to match a perfect body, firm breasts,  sharp  chin,
          and slightly  bent  nose.    The  deadly green eyes are
          matched only by the .38 she pointed between his.

          "Lint?" she asks, eyes  locking  with  his.    Thinking
          quickly, Lint recalls the neighbor he doesn't like.

          "Sorry.    He's  two  houses  down.  .  .  ."  he  says
          helpfully.

               The woman notices the copies of his  book  on  the
          table  (the  ones  he  keeps to give away to anyone who
          will take  it).    On  the  back,  facing  her,  is   a
          photograph of  his  smiling  face.  Lint smiles, like a
          little boy caught at a lie.  She pulls back the  hammer
          of her pistol.

          "You're Lint.  You killed daddy. . . ."

          With  this,  I  can  then  add  character  thoughts,  ideas,
     FidoNews 5-10                Page 9                    7 Mar 1988


     emotions, descriptive blocks, dialog, etc.  Usually off  the  top
     of my head, as I do most of my writing while doing mundane chores
     (vacuuming, sweeping,  sex).    I've been cursed with a very good
     memory, and what I think up I can usually get back out  when  the
     time comes.   I find I can usually get six or seven pages (typed,
     double spaced) out of a few short sentences  like  above.    I've
     been  told by better men than I that this method of writing never
     sells, and I think of them every  time  I  cash  the  publisher's
     checks.

          When  the  story  is  done  I open a desk drawer (the middle
     left, with the bottom falling out and the side unglued) and  fish
     for an envelope.    Some times I find one, often I don't.  If one
     is not to be had, I fold a sheet of paper into an  envelope,  and
     use a  roll  of  tape  getting  it  to stay shut.  If I'm lucky I
     remember to put the MS in it first.

          I always include a stamped, self-addressed envelope as well,
     so that the editor can immediately reject it  and  send  it  back
     with few  delays.   This means I can send it out again as soon as
     possible.  The letter is  ALWAYS  addressed  to  the  editor,  so
     she/he/it will  feel  like it belongs to her/etc.  As a very rich
     (i.e. powerful) editor is fond of saying "If the  writer  doesn't
     know my  name  I  don't  want to know his!"  I, in my humble way,
     agree.  What is the alternative? "Dear Sir and/or  Madame?"    No
     "personal" note or letter is ever included.  Stuff like:

          "I'm  a  widow  with eleven children, and I desperately
          need to sell my book  'Gone  With  Virginity'  to  you.
          Please buy it."

          "This article  has taken me seven years to write.  When
          you buy it, put it on page three, next to the adds  for
          laxatives."

          "Please  find  inclosed  the fifth of gin, and drink it
          before you read my short story."  (You  will  soon  get
          your short story back, nix the gin.)

          "Buy this and my body is yours to toy with."  If you do
          use   this,  don't  forget  the  photographs  as  well.
          Eight-by-tens preferably.

          For postage stamps I go through all the old  Christmas  card
     envelopes that  I  get, and find some to steam off.  I have found
     that if you ask people to put a two-cent stamp at the  top  right
     corner  of  the  envelope,  and the twenty-cent one under it, the
     two-cent stamp gets marked at the  post  office,  but  the  other
     isn't.   If  everyone did this we could pay off the National Debt
     in a few years with all the money saved.  We could also go smugly
     to jail.

          If the MS is a book, like "Lint's Luck," then I make five or
     six copies (single sided only, so the  type  on  the  other  side
     doesn't  show  through), at work so I don't have to pay for them.
     This saves me 2.5 cents a page, or roughly the price of  a  quart
     FidoNews 5-10                Page 10                   7 Mar 1988


     of Cutty  Shark  per  book.   These copies then seek out a likely
     buyer via mail, while I'm soaking in the tub at home dreaming  of
     the future fortune, and author's teas and parties they will throw
     for me when the book goes to it's tenth printing.

          How do  I  rough  out the characters in a story?  There is a
     very good, logical way of doing so.

          Once assaulted by an idea (often while trying to  sleep,  or
     while driving),  I  hunt  around my mental attic for a hero.  For
     instance, if the story is a Space Adventure, and has in  it  evil
     Planet Lords and a beautiful princess to rescue (or a harlot- see
     my  story  "Gallantry  is a Harsh Mistress"), then my hero should
     have a large sword, a lusty appetite for honorable  bloodletting,
     a  tiny leather loin cloth, and a rather small brain (i.e. a none
     too bright lad).

          If the story is about a teacher  being  abducted,  with  the
     kidnapper demanding an "A+" in Biology for her release, we know a
     lot of  things  already.   First off, the student is a dim-witted
     cad and heel, and was never taught to be nice to  people.    This
     can be a tragedy, comedy, or love story.

          Another example  could  be  Lint.  I wanted a main character
     who was not very impressive, brave, rich, or demanding  of  life.
     But  he also needed several above-average qualities to be dynamic
     and interesting.   These  two  opposite  characteristics  had  to
     balance  (and not cancel each other out) in a sometimes humorous,
     often sad way.

          So Lint is a plumber (non-threatening, rather  mundane)  who
     has  written  a  moderately well selling book (a dynamic quality,
     but not overly so).  It reasonably follows that Lint had patents:
     One of each sex.  I give the Daddy a beard, the Mummy  an  apron.
     See how  easy  it is?  Since Lint's parents probably had sex more
     than once, he may have had some brothers.  In fact, he had two.

          Lint being a rather average chap, I wanted his  brothers  to
     be a  bit  more  colorful.  The both, therefore, went to Vietnam,
     but only one came  back  (which  is  often  the  case  in  police
     actions).   The  surviving  Vet  turned  middle-aged  hippie, who
     marches in anti-war demonstrations, and likes beating  up  people
     who don't  like his ear ring.  He also pounds on folks that pound
     on Lint, as is a big brother's duty.

          That, basically, is how I write.  It  is  by  far  the  most
     unprofessional way that I know, as well as the best, so I use it.

              Consolidate or Divide?  The Future of EchoMail
                           -J. Kenneth Riviere
                           133/303, JoKeR's BBS
                           (after office hours)
                                  2/24/88


     I have been giving some thought to the configuration and history
     of Fidonet recently and I decided that there were some things
     that I wanted to say.  First let me say that I have only been a
     sysop for about six months now, but I have been a user on a local
     Fido system for several years so my familiarity with Fidonet goes
     back further than just the time of my sysoping.

     Despite the title of my article I want to make it clear that this
     is not an either-or situation.  Fidonet has been consolidating
     and dividing responsibilities for years in an effort to achieve a
     more efficient and effective configuration.


     HISTORY

     My understanding of the beginnings of Fidonet is that all nodes
     were essentially independents when the net first started.  This
     was great when there were only a few dozen nodes altogether, but
     it became awkward when the number grew into the hundreds and then
     the thousands.  With some boards attempting to communicate very
     actively with literally dozens of other boards, the NMH became
     too short to make all of the connections necessary to deliver the
     mail.  Out of this grew nets, where all the mail going from one
     board to multiple other boards which were geographically close to
     each other (and probably cheap to call locally) was consolidated
     and sent to the net host who then passed it on to the other local
     boards.  International communications was streamlined with the
     introduction of ZoneGates which allowed this especially expensive
     communication to be consolidated so that fewer total calls needed
     to be made from one continent to another.  As some nets grew
     larger and became more cumbersome to administer the concept of
     the hub was introduced so that the net host could communicate
     mainly with a few hubs instead of having to distribute mail to
     dozens of boards every night.  Thus the nodes within a hub were
     consolidated and the responsibilities of the net host were
     divided.

     This type of cooperative arrangement whereby a few boards picked
     up extra tasks in order to smooth the running of the net as well
     as ease the cost of running a board has been a hallmark of
     Fidonet throughout its existence.  People recognized that this
     was applicable to Echomail as well and the backbone formed.  I am
     not certain I understand exactly how the backbone is organized
     but I think that each region has an echomail coordinator (EC) who
     connects to a central node to exchange echomail.  Other nodes in
     that region can arrange to pick up echomail from the EC, thus
     providing consolidated points for echomail to be distributed
     across the country.  I have heard that there is currently an
     effort being made to ease the load on the Regional ECs by asking
     FidoNews 5-10                Page 12                   7 Mar 1988


     that each net select a single Net EC who would pick up echos from
     the Region EC and redistribute them within the net.  Thus, as it
     was with hubs, the traffic for one group (nets, in this case) is
     consolidated so that the burden on the board providing service at
     the next level up the tree is lessened.

     It is clear that the traditional method of consolidating traffic
     and dividing responsibility within Fidonet has been to do it
     along hierarchical lines.  A top-level node distributes to
     sub-levels which further distribute to lower levels of the
     hierarchy and so on and so on until finally the data gets to the
     nodes at the end of the paths.  This has been an effective
     mechanism for setting things up.  However, I think that we may be
     coming to a time when we will want to take a different approach.


     ECHOMAIL VOLUME

     The volume of Echomail is growing quickly, at least as quickly as
     Fidonet itself.  As new nodes are added there are more voices to
     be heard in each echo and more sites wishing to receive each
     echo.  This increases the volume of traffic up and down the
     tree.

     Hubs (in Net 133 at least, the Hub coordinators redistribute
     echomail as well as net mail) generally carry less echomail
     traffic than the Net ECs because there are fewer boards under
     them to which the echos need to be distributed as well as fewer
     echos which are desired than there are in the entire net.  Some
     of the echos which are brought in for certain boards are not
     wanted in some of the hub groups.  Thus the hub coordinator has a
     lighter load than the Net EC.

     Similarly, the Net EC is not likely to carry every echo carried
     by the Region EC as some of the echos may not interest anyone in
     that particular net.  Thus the net EC has a lighter load than
     the Region EC.

     But, what happens when a new node is added.  There are more msgs
     in a few echos as people on that node post, and there may be a
     desire to bring in a few more echos since the sysop and users of
     this new node may have interests that haven't been addressed by
     the echos currently being carried in that net.  This increases
     the load on the hub coordinator (but not too much, it's only one
     more node and a couple more echos to that node), on the Net EC
     (and this is a little heavier than on the hub coordinator since
     there are new nodes in multiple other hubs which also want more
     echos), and on the Region EC (who is echoing more areas to nets
     all the time as new nodes are added all over the region).  When a
     net picks up a new echo it may mean only a small increase in the
     traffic from the Region EC to the central distribution point
     since the Region EC was already carrying the echo, he just hadn't
     been feeding it to that particular net.  However, it becomes a
     significant load on the distribution within the region since over
     time each net continues to pick up more and more echos and might
     go from getting 20% of the echos carried by the Region EC up to
     FidoNews 5-10                Page 13                   7 Mar 1988


     40%, 50%, or even more until it takes almost as long to
     communicate with each net as it does to get the traffic to and
     from the rest of the backbone.  Multiply that by the number of
     nets and we could start to reach the saturation point of how much
     echomail the Region ECs can distribute effectively.

     I'm going to try to guess some figures.  Some of these are based
     on a little bit of research and some of them are just guesses.  I
     saw a msg from a Region EC that stated that he was bringing about
     a megabyte of data into his region every day.  At 9600 bps this
     represents about 20 minutes.  I checked the different zone 1
     regions and found anywhere from 1 net in the region (region 12)
     to more than 20.  Just to get a feel for how much traffic we are
     talking about let's try some figures.  For a region with 25 nets,
     each of which is picking up, say 1/3 of the traffic available
     from the region EC (I know that my net brings in somewhere on the
     order of .5 to .6 mb per day), this comes to about 7 minutes for
     each of 25 nodes which works out to about three hours.  This does
     not allow for the time it takes for the Region EC to unARC, toss,
     scan, and ARC the mail bundles, which will be a significant
     amount of time with this volume of traffic.  For a region with 12
     nets each of which is getting 1/3 of the traffic available from
     the region EC this would only be about 1.5 hours. Both of these
     calculations assume that 9600 bps connections are being used.  If
     half of the nets are using only 2400 bps connections then that
     more than doubles the total communication time required to get
     the echomail delivered.  These situations are workable with all
     echomail getting delivered every night during the low-cost ld
     hours (unless the region with many nets has several nets which
     must rely on 2400 bps connections or less, in which case it is
     very possible that multiple nets might not get their echomail on
     any given night.

     However, now let us up the ante.  What happens when echomail
     volume reaches 1.5 mb/day?  Remember also that by that time more
     nodes will have joined Fidonet so that there will likely be a few
     more nets and the existing nets will be bigger meaning that they
     will be likely to want more echo areas.  So the 20 minutes to
     pickup 1 mb would become 30 minutes to pick up 1.5 mb.  Suppose
     the region with 25 nets has grown to the point where there are 28
     nets (modest growth) but now the nets want on average about half
     of the total echomail which is available from the region EC. That
     means a 15 minute connection for each of 28 nets for a total of
     7.5 hours a night (including the .5 hour to pick up the 1.5 mb)!
     That is a lot of time.  Since the low ld rates only last from
     11-7 which is only eight hours it is clear that it would be
     almost impossible to get all of this traffic delivered every
     night during that window.  Remember, I still haven't allowed any
     time in my calculations for tossing and scanning and I've been
     assuming all 9600 bps connections.

     Even looking at the region with only 12 nets it is starting to
     get squeezed.  Let us assume that it has grown to 14 nets with
     each net desiring an average of half of what the backbone
     carries.  This still works out to four hours of transmission time
     assuming 9600 bps and does not include tossing and scanning.  And
     FidoNews 5-10                Page 14                   7 Mar 1988


     of course, none of these calculations have allowed any time for
     any activity other than distributing echomail.  Surely we do not
     want to condemn anyone who volunteers to help with echomail by
     being a Region EC to not being able to do any other activities
     such as having real, human callers (mail (echomail) only from
     11pm to 7am?).

     The method for dealing with this which follows the tradition of
     Fidonet would be to introduce a new tier of distribution.  This
     might be called sub-regions or something, perhaps along state
     lines, and would reduce the number of sites which the Region EC
     would have to serve, going from many nets to a handful of
     states.  This would certainly work and would allow the traffic
     to continue to grow with only a few more volunteers, but at this
     point I'd like to suggest a couple of alternatives.


     PARALLEL BACKBONES

     The first thing I'd like to suggest is that a parallel backbone
     be set up.  I don't want to duplicate the work being done by the
     backbone, I want to set up a parallel system that works
     side-by-side with the current backbone in order to serve Fidonet
     more effectively.  Rather than suggesting a whole new set of
     sites which are carrying the same echos as before, I propose that
     the traffic which is all being funneled through the Region ECs be
     split to go through two (or even more) Region ECs.  This is not
     to say that any single region could not be served by one EC, but
     in a region where that load is getting too heavy for it to work
     effectively, instead of introducing a new tier simply split the
     load at that level.  Suppose we divide the echos being carried
     into subject categories, maybe Technical (includes TECH, COMM,
     FOSSIL, MEADOW, PASCAL, PS2, OS2, and other echos which provide
     information about how programs work, what new ideas are being
     considered for addition to the net, etc.) and Social (includes
     BIBLE, NOPIRACY, LAW, SF, PETS, etc.).  Another possible
     subdivision would be to have a NetAdmin or SysopOnly group which
     would carry echos which pertain to the running of the net.
     Perhaps the Technical side could be split into computer-related
     and non-computer-related.

     Reducing the volume of traffic by dividing the echos into
     multiple groups instead of reducing the traffic by reducing the
     number of nodes to be serviced by the Region EC achieves the same
     desired effect:  the amount of data being funneled through the
     Region ECs is reduced by increasing the number of people who are
     sharing the responsibility for delivering that data.  However,
     splitting the echos into multiple groups of echos, each carried
     by different and cooperating Region ECs, also has a desirable
     effect which the other approach to sharing the load does not: by
     not introducing a new tier into the distribution mechanism there
     would be fewer propogation delays in getting the echomail from
     one end of the net to the other.

     Right now when I post a msg in a national echo it gets sent 1) to
     my hub coordinator, 2) to my Net EC, 3) to my Region EC, 4) to
     FidoNews 5-10                Page 15                   7 Mar 1988


     the central, coordinating site, 5) to other Region ECs, 6) to
     other Net ECs, 7) to other hub coordinators (not in all nets),
     and finally 8) to other nodes at the far end of the distribution
     chain.  If we add sub-regions to that chain that puts two more
     links through which msgs must pass before they are fully
     distributed (one link going up the chain, and one link coming
     back down).  By introducing parallel operations as I've suggested
     we would not be introducing any more delays into the distribution
     mechanism.

     Another advantage of this arrangement is that if something
     happens to one of the Region ECs in a region it only affects a
     portion of the echomail traffic in that region.  If we went to a
     sub-region EC arrangement and something happened to the Region
     EC then the sub-regions would all be cut off from all backbone
     echomail until the problem could be resolved.

     Still another consideration is that it translates readily to the
     net level if echomail traffic in a particular net gets too heavy.
     In such a situation then two (or more) Net ECs could operate,
     each responsible for contacting a particular Region EC.

     One disadvantage of my suggested approach is that it does mean
     more calls will be made.  A Net EC who had been making one call
     per night to the Region EC and picking up that day's echomail
     would now have to make two or more calls, one to the Region EC
     for each group of echomail.  This is a slight decrease in
     efficiency.  However, I have to wonder:  is it really *that* much
     more efficient to make one 10 minute call than to make two 5
     minute calls?  It seems to me that as long as there was a
     significant amount of echomail to be picked up then the marginal
     increase in efficiency acheived by consolidating two long calls
     into one longer call is not worth the propogation delays that
     will ultimately be introduced if we add another tier to the
     echomail distribution arrangement.


     LOCALIZED ECHOS

     I have heard some people suggest having local area echos and I
     think that something like this can be useful.  Here in Atlanta we
     have a general topic echo which is open to the public and gets a
     fair amount of traffic without being overwhelming.  There are
     also Region18 and Sysop18 echos for distribution within Region
     18 which have been well received.  It was suggested that we
     start a Tech18 echo and perhaps some other echos which would be
     local to Region 18.

     A big advantage that this echo would have over the national TECH
     echo is that it would not have as much traffic.  Right now the
     national echo has so many msgs that it is very difficult to keep
     up with.

     A major disadvantage is that there would be fewer people who
     could contribute their expertise to difficult problems since
     noone outside of Region 18 would be participating.  However, some
     FidoNews 5-10                Page 16                   7 Mar 1988


     of the people making this suggestion are pointing out that, while
     they are interested and are capable of helping people with
     problems, the national echo just has too much volume to make it
     worth the large amount of time it would take to keep up with, and
     so they don't read it and many potential contributors are lost to
     the echo anyway.

     If people nationally, even internationally, could agree that the
     widely distributed echos would be only for problems which could
     not be solved at a more local level and that local echos covering
     the same topics would be available for fielding the simpler
     questions then many more people could be served.  Let the local
     echos with more limited distribution be people's first source of
     help with problems.  Then, if an answer cannot be found there,
     bring it up for discussion on the national echo.  This approach
     has a two fold advantage.

     First of all the simpler questions from less experienced users
     would be likely to get answered in a more timely fashion since
     echomail should propogate faster on the local level.  It wouldn't
     take as long for the questions and answers to propogate and there
     would still be a large base of capable users (if we're talking
     about a regional echo this would still be likely to go to dozens
     if not hundreds of boards).

     Secondly, by getting a lot of the simpler stuff out of the
     national echo it would make it easier to keep up with the msgs
     there and the quality of the information to be gleaned from that
     echo would improve.  A good quality, national echo would attract
     even more people who would be capable of contributing to the
     discussion as opposed to the current situation where capable
     people get fed up with the volume of traffic, much of which is
     too simple to hold their interest.

     In order for a system such as this to work it would take
     cooperation from many sysops to help ensure that their users
     understand that they should first go to the local echo for help
     with problems which are not monumental.  Only after they have
     found that noone in the local echo could help them should they
     post problems to the national echo.  Of course, if there is a
     topic that is clearly of national interest (a newly verified bug
     in a major compiler, for example) then it would not be
     inappropriate to post this information to the national echo right
     away, or even to both echos.

     This is one area (among others) that usenet's distribution
     software has better capabilities than Fidonet's.  The software
     for posting articles in usenet lets you post to a national group
     while specifying local distribution so as to avoid causing
     systems all over the world from having to pay for distributing a
     msg which is only of local interest.  It would be nice if the
     echo software had a byte in each msg where it could be recorded
     whether the msg was intended for local or extended distribution
     (even options for many levels, node, net, state, region,
     national, zone, international) and then identifying the links for
     echomail as either local, national, or whatever and the echo
     FidoNews 5-10                Page 17                   7 Mar 1988


     software wouldn't bundle up a local msg for a link which is
     designated as a national link.  However, it doesn't do this and
     at this point the only choice is to set up separate echos if
     different distribution patterns are desired.  At least, it is the
     only way I know of to limit distribution of some msgs while
     letting other msgs of a similar subject matter be distributed
     widely.


     CONCLUSIONS

     I'm not sure I can make any, but I was taught that written papers
     or reports should always have a conclusion, so I'll try.

     I think that it is clear that the volume of echomail is going to
     increase.  With more nodes coming on line all of the time we need
     to be making plans for how to deal with this without sacrificing
     too much efficiency, timeliness, or expense.  I have made a
     couple of proposals which I think could possibly help to keep the
     effort required to support echomail distribution manageable while
     at the same time not introducing gross inefficiencies that would
     offset the gains realized from these suggested reorganizations.

     I welcome constructive criticism.  Flames will be consigned to
     /dev/null.

                  MENSA Echo Loses It's Founder and Host

     George Falcon
     1:109/648

     My friend, mentor, and fellow Mensan Jim Kay suffered the loss of
     his 80 Meg hard disk this past week.   This  has prompted  Jim to
     reconsider his  involvement in  this hobby,  which can  be a very
     expensive one, not only in cash, but in time as well.

     Jim was hosting the MENSA echo even before my wife Dot and  I met
     at  a  Mensa  Happy  Hour  in  D.C.  in  October  of 1985, and he
     patiently helped us through  the rocky  road to  establishing our
     node  using  Fido  v.  11w.    I fully expect we'll stay in touch
     (after all, he only lives a half hour north of College Park, MD.,
     where  we  are),  but  I'll  miss  having his wit around the net.
     American Mensa owes him  a lot,  whether the  members know  it or
     not, and many do.

     The MENSA  echo conference  had, at  my last (not fully informed)
     count 22 systems in the U.S.  and Canada  as participants.   I've
     sent a  message to  most of  the sysops in the conference through
     netmail, but since some  nodes are  fed the  echo indirectly, I'm
     writing this for FidoNews in the hope that more interested sysops
     will contact me via netmail.  For those  sysops who  were getting
     the echo  and would  like to continue, I'd like to hear from you.
     I've volunteered to host the echo, at least  temporarily, until a
     faster  system  with  more  storage  can  be found, provided it's
     operated by a member  who's  dedicated  to  the  success  of this
     medium.

     For  those  of  you,  sysops  or  users,  who think they might be
     interested in joining the echo, I  ask that  you also  contact me
     via netmail.  We'll work something out.

     For those  who'd like  to know  a little more about Mensa itself,
     you can file request or download MENSA.INF from our pure Opus
     system.  The address of American Mensa Ltd. is 2626  E. 14th St.,
     Bklyn., N.Y.  11235-3992.  The only requirement is a score in the
     98th  percentile  on   a   number   of   standardized   tests  of
     intelligence.   Those interested  in membership  in Intertel (the
     99th percentile) can file request or download INTERTEL.INF.

     I found a housemate, a part-time job, a  full time  job, and last
     but certainly  not least...  my wife... all through Mensa.  I'm a
     bit biased, but I think Mensa's a fun organization.

                         Corrections and Apologies

        I  would  like  to  correct  certain  parts  of  my article in
     FidoNews 5:7.

        First, I misstated the name of  the International Coordinator.
     It is David Dodell, not Donald Dodell.

        Second, I  referred to  Bill Bolton as the Zone 3 Coordinator.
     He was replaced by Matt Whelan months ago.

        Third, I misrepresented my column as an article. It was not my
     intent to  act as  the role of a journalist or a reporter, but as
     that of a commentator. As such  I was  only stating  my opinions,
     not attempting  to cover the subject thoroughly. Because of this,
     I did not contact  any  of  those  currently  involved  in other-
     network  gateways.  I  do  not  feel  that  this  is particularly
     improper behavior for a commentator, which  is what  I was trying
     to be.  However, I  am aware  that it was easy to misinterpret my
     intent, and this was my fault.

        I  sincerely  apologize  for  mistakes  I  have  made.  I will
     endeavor not to make the same mistakes again.

           A STATEMENT OF POSITION BY IFNA BOARD OF DIRECTORS


     IFNA believes in the continued and peaceful coexistence of
     individual bulletin boards and electronic mail systems joined
     together through the FidoNet network.  Recognizing that FidoNet
     is an international collection of system operators, users, and
     supporters, it is with great caution and limited scope that an
     international association must tread.  Given this caveat, IFNA
     accepts as primary responsibilities: maintaining a nodelist;
     publication of a newsletter; the FidoNet Technical Standards;
     and an international conference.

     IFNA firmly takes the stand that all system operators within the
     FidoNet network are joined by a moral and ethical thread to
     further the development and education of international
     communication for the benefit and good of all people.
     Additionally, IFNA acts as an advisor and a resource to the
     Fidonet group as a whole.

     IFNA maintains a standard nodelist to provide a directory of all
     FidoNet systems in a common format that permits international
     communication to proceed unimpeded.  IFNA also supports and
     participates in the formation, promulgation, and publication of
     the necessary technical standards to promote electronic
     communication.  Finally, IFNA fosters international
     communication on a human level by sponsoring an annual
     international conference (FIDOCON).

     IFNA also serves in an advisory role to assist in the resolution
     of any concerns that affect the local, regional, national, or
     international nature of the network.

     IFNA will provide the structures to promote international
     growth, goodwill and understanding among electronic
     communications systems and operators.

     IFNA recognizes the current structures of FidoNet as they stand
     and believes FidoNet is self-perpetuating and, in the final
     analysis, self-governing.

     Additionally, IFNA maintains that future policies will evolve
     through the structure of, and be mandated by, the network.
     IFNA's role will then be to codify these policies to protect the
     interests of all.
