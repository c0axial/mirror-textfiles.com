        The hot question on Fidonet these days is "When do I get 
        10h?"  We now have the definitive answer; you don't.  It 
        seems that there have been several versions of 10h (?), so 
        it's going to be called 10i when it is officially released, 
        in order to ensure that everyone has the same version.  

        So when do we get our hands on 10i?  The word I got last 
        Wednesday was that it would be released no later than last 
        Friday.  So what happened?  Well, it seems that Tom Jennings 
        thought of another feature to add at the last minute, so 
        release has been delayed until the new (newer?) version is 
        fully tested.  

        The new feature is a goodie, and should make many peoples' 
        lives much easier, so it's worth the wait.  It's the ability 
        to have one Fido be two different net/node numbers (such as 
        being, say, 1230/1 on a private net, while still being 
        107/375 on the public net).  In the new scheme of things, we 
        will be node 375 in net 107 (Metro NY), but I plan on 
        setting 1/375 as my alternate net/node for awhile until I'm 
        pretty sure everyone has the new stuff working.  What you

        will do, I have no idea.  

        One option you DON'T have is to leave things alone.  They're 
        serious about this, guys.  The official rumor I hear is that 
        anyone who doesn't convert to the new setup within a month 
        or two is going to get dropped from the national list.  The 
        guys in St.  Louis have been doing a bang-up job, but it's 
        just gotten too big for mere mortals to cope with.  

        NODELIST and ROUTEGEN will also have to change, but there's 
        a bit of a hitch there.  It seems John Warren (the guy who 
        wrote them) is in the hospital.  I'm told he's been bugging 
        his wife to bring in his computer (a sentiment I can well 
        understand), but I wouldn't count on anything for awhile.  
        Let's just leave the guy in peace, to get well at his own 
        pace.  Good luck to you, John!  

        So when do we get 10i?  Any Day Now.  In fact, this 
        editorial is in severe danger of being rendered obsolete 
        even as I write it (Saturday night).  It's to be released 
        just as soon as Tom Jennings feels secure about it.  From 
        what I've seen, that won't be too long.  I've test-run a 
        copy of 10h, and I can testify that it looks pretty good.  
        If it has any bugs, I didn't find them.  

        There IS one small thing I found, though.  This is just a 
        little unofficial advice from me to you.  Don't bring up 10i 
        while you still have pending outgoing messages.  In my case, 
        I had a whole bunch of mail waiting to go out when I brought 
        up 10h and told it I was 107/375.  That night, at mail hour, 
        it saw a bunch of mail from some other node (375 in net 1) 
        and marked them all as orphans.  Then, since it had no 
        instructions to forward mail for 1/375, it left them sitting 
        there.  I suppose I could have set my ROUTE.BBS to accept 
        mail for forwarding from 1/375, but I didn't get around to 
        trying it.  My advice is to just sit tight and wait for your 
        mail to go out, and then bring 10i up before entering any 
        new messages.

        **********************************************************
                      Sensible Piracy Protection             
        **********************************************************
        4/21/85 13:00
        Just this morning, I was thumbing back through my latest
        version of PC Magazine and came across a very unusual ad.
        It is put out by Peter Norton. In this ad, he extols his
        product, the Norton Utils. Version 3.0, which if you have
        ever used these fine utilities will agree with me that
        they are a very handy little item to have in your toolbox
        of goodies.

        These, like many other fine programs of its ilk, are not
        copy-protected. So far, so good. We at least have a step
        in the right direction. But it wasn't so much the fact
        that he changed his ad that caught my eye, but  rather, it
        was the little blurb at the bottom about upgrades. To wit:

                        Got an old  version?  Upgrade to
                        Version 3 for $25. Got a pirated
                        copy? Go legitimate. Get the new
                        version and  your own manual for
                        the upgrade price.  Just  send a
                        check and your old disk.

        A new twist in the ever-increasing  heated battle against
        software piracy? YOU BET. I applaud Mr. Norton for his for-
        ward-thinking attitude about the problem, and a rational,
        thought-out approach to the problem versus that of Mr. Mitch
        Kapor who is hellbent on snagging every last pirated copy of
        Lotus and Symphony on the market today, and I can assure you
        that that number is quite large.  Mr. Norton doesn't employ
        stupid copy-protection garbage like Lotus.  You are free to
        make as many copies of the programs as you desire.  Instead
        of punishing the pirate, he is giving them a chance to "go
        legitimate". I might point out that the current version of
        the programs goes for the tidy little sum of $99.95. So all
        in all, what we have here is a very good approach to the
        problem, instead of a knee-jerk reaction the oft-inflated
        over-blown problem of software piracy. 

        Ultimately, the software industry will have to change. Users
        with super XT systems packed with megabytes of storage will
        no longer tolerate the inexcusable approach of only one
        copy on your hard-disk per floppy. There exists only one
        form of copyprotection that can not  be broken (yet) and 
        that is through the use of ROM-based software.  And if the
        software publishers and authors think for two nanoseconds
        that I'm gonna sit still for that (and this applies to you,
        too, gentle reader) they have another thought coming.

        I, for one, will take my business elsewhere. Copy-protection
        is ultimately a means of defeating the  purpose of software,
        and  any kid with  two bits worth of knowledge on a computer

        can crack just about every scheme on the market today.

        Granted, there is one drawback to this problem and that
        is one relating to the legitimate users who actually pur-
        chased the software.  I fully understand the objections to
        offering pirates the same benefits as a legitimate user,
        but nonetheless, I still believe this is a positive step
        in the right direction.

        Perhaps this is a trend of things to come. I don't know that
        for certain, but it certainly is an encouraging sign. Per-
        haps the  software authors of the world will eventually
        learn. That remains to be seen.

        Freeware
        David Kaplan, Fido #387
         
        The mainstay of bulletin boards is freeware.  However, those 
        of us that use public domain software at work have a problem 
        many private users are not aware of.  

        Corporations are extremely sensitive to the source of their 
        software to ensure that any proprietary programs are 
        legitimately licensed.  If freeware comes with a ".doc" file 
        indicating this fact, or the application itself displays 
        such a message there is no problem.  

        The problems arise when there is no indication that a piece 
        of software is actually in the public domain.  Ideally, the 
        freeware message and the author's name and address would be 
        desired to indicate this fact.  

        This could appear in any of 3 places:
          1) Part of a ".DOC" file, or more preferably,
          2) Part of the application's screen display, or
          3) As a 'display' message that can be seen if the .EXE or 
             .COM file is typed.  

        Without this information, many companies are quite hesitant 
        to use and perhaps enhance public domain software.  Many 
        utilities that we have at home are unavailable to us at 
        work.  

        It is an impossible task to track down existing freeware 
        authors, but if we start following this concept for all new 
        software, the authors will get the recognition they deserve.

        ****  Reply to Fido 464 and all IBM BBS Fido sysops ****
        ========================================================
        In reply to Node 464's request for swapping software via 
        routing  boxes of  disks around the country, I'm in full
        support of the idea.  I currently have around 12 - 13 MB
        of IBM-only software collected  from around the  country
        which cost me in the neighborhood of around $800 to $900
        to download, and while it does represent a very nice bit
        of stuff, I find I'm running out of new stuff at an alar
        ming rate. If there are any takers out there who are in-
        terested, please  let me  know.  Just about everything I
        now have has been tested for basic soundness and useful-
        ness and has  withstood  the test of time by hundreds of
        users in my area (Fido 59 is basically the only IBM sys-
        tem in this neck  of the  woods).  If any of you wish to
        do some swapping, by all means let me know. I always can
        use new  stuff!  There are a lot of top-quality programs
        that I have that are begging to be spread around the US.

        While I'm  on the topic, I need to have Fido 464 contact
        me via the net because I can't find a very current node-
        list....464, consider yourself paged!

        Please respond and direct all inquiries to:

                    MODULA-2

          We are looking for Modula-2 programs or users running
        Modlua-2 for the purpose of public domain program exchange.
        Comments on impressions of present compilers and systems
        are welcome at Fido node #418. We are interested in finding
        out anything relating to this new language.
         We would also like to hear from anyone who might know
        any news or have comments on the "Revisions and Amendments
        to Modula-2" by N. Wirth published in the "Journal of
        Pascal, ADA & Modula-2", 85 Jan/Feb, Vol 4 No 1 issue.
         We have Logitech Modula-2/86 source available for M2MDM,
        a XMODEM - MODEM7 package for the Sanyo MBC-55x running
        under MS-DOS 2.11. It supports up to 4800 bps and is an
        example of interrupt processing using Modula-2 co-routines.
        It lacks, at present, phone book and dialing features. So
        dialing is manual from the keyboard if your modem supports
        it. Full CRC error checking and batch transfers compatible
        with Fido are included.
         Also available is SYMDUMP for examining the contents of
        compiled ".sym" files. SymDump is quite portable and is
        especially useful if the ".def" source is not available!

        PC-Rockland, located in scenic South Nyack, New York is one 
        of the many RBBS systems around. However, few if any can 
        claim all the features we found when we called into the 
        system.  

        The Sysop currently is running 3 nodes simultaneously, with 
        the capacity for 1 more node immediately available when 
        needed.  

        The system currently supports 2400 baud, as well as the 
        usual 1200 and 300 baud connections. As of last night the 
        total storage space on the system exceeds 250 megabytes, all 
        of which is on-line, available storage.  

        The Sysop has networked an IBM AT using PC-NET along with 3 
        IBM PC's to form the nucleus of his system. The AT has a 60 
        megabyte internal hard drive, and an external 'tower' drive 
        with tape backup. He happens to be a BETA test site for RBBS 
        so you will ALWAYS find at least the most current version of 
        RRBS running, and usually an advanced version, not yet 
        released.  

        At last count there were over 40 directories of software for 
        downloading, with literally thousands of programs available, 
        so every caller can find something he likes there.  

        If you are interested in calling this unique system it is 
        running 24 hours a day at (914) 353-2176, and all callers 
        are welcome to call on that number. Once on the system the 
        other numbers and associated information is displayed for 
        you.

                       RUNNING FIDO ON THE SANYO 550
                                WAYNE CONRAD
                                 FIDO #452


        Having  just  set up FIDO to run on my SANYO  555  with  the 
        Anchor   Mark  XII  Modem,   I  found  it  to  be  quite  an 
        experience...   I had problems with the DOS,  problems  with 
        the serial interface and problems with the modem.  With some 
        fiddling  around  and a lot of help from the Sysops  of  the 
        other SANYO BBS's around the country, I finally did get FIDO 
        to  work correctly with this configuration.   I figure maybe 
        this  article  will help anyone else who wants  to  try  it.  
        What the heck, maybe my instructions will even be correct!


                           COMMAND-LINE SWITCHES

        The first thing I had trouble figuring out was the /V switch 
        which  is used in the command line to tell FIDO which bit of 
        the serial port's status byte is used as the carrier detect.  
        With  the SANYO it is bit 7,  and the mask for bit 7 is  2^7 
        which is 128, so your /V switch will be like this:

             SYO_FIDO 128/V

        Of course you will need to include other switches in the
        command line for things like download limits and so forth.

        We're  using  bit 7 as the carrier detect because  it's  the 
        only  status bit presented by the 8251A which  controls  the 
        serial  port.   The  8251A  simply accepts this  signal  and 
        reflects it's status in that bit, nothing more.  If you have 
        the  SANYO  serial card,  then the signal presented  to  the 
        8251A  is  the DTR (Data Terminal Ready),  not  the  Carrier 
        Detect.   You can tell if you have this problem because FIDO 
        will either never answer an incoming call, or it will answer 
        calls that don't exist.   If this is your problem, then read 
        on; I'll present some solutions that should work.


                         SANYO SERIAL CARD PROBLEMS

        In the SANYO serial card, the signal represented by bit 7 is 
        DSR  (data  set  ready),  not CD (carrier  detect)  as  FIDO 
        expects.   This  will either cause FIDO to never answer  the 
        phone,  or to always answer even when there`s no connection.  
        What  you  need to do is to present CD to  the  serial  card 
        instead of DTR.   There are a few ways to do this that I can 
        think of:

             o Modify the modem cable

             o Use a Null Modem or other adapter

             o Get a serial card that allows you to select CD or DSR
               by using jumpers

             o Modify the serial card you have


        MODIFY THE MODEM CABLE

        On the computer end of the modem cable there are two signals 
        we are concerned with here:

            Pin 6 -- DSR (Data Set Ready)
            Pin 8 -- CD  (Carrier Detect)

        Oh by the way, you need to have your modem set up to present 
        a  "true  carrier" on the CD Line.   I don't know  how  this 
        works,  since  the Anchor always presents a "true  carrier," 
        but I guess that with your modem set for "true carrier," the 
        CD line goes active only after the two modems have connected 
        and have good carriers on the line.   Probably with a "false 
        carrier"  (?)  the  CD goes active when the phone  rings  or 
        something like that.  In any case, some modems have a switch 
        for this; make sure it is set for "true carrier."

        What we want to do is to present the CD line to pin 6 rather 
        than the DSR line.  If your modem cable has a solder-on end, 
        then  you can probably do the job with a soldering  iron  in 
        just  a few minutes.   Just Unsolder the DSR line from pin 6 
        of  the  connecter (remember this is the  connecter  on  the 
        COMPUTER END of the cable).   Put a little electricians tape 
        or  silicon  jel  on the now freed DSR line  to  prevent  it 
        causing  a  short.   Unsolder  the CD line from  pin  8  and 
        resolder  it  to pin 6.   Be careful of course to check  for 
        solder  bridges  and the like;  Modems (and  computers)  get 
        quite  upset about shorts and may punish you  with  DOWNTIME 
        and REPAIR BILLS.

        If  your cable is ribbon cable with the press on  ends,  you 
        will need to remove the end.   This is a bit tricky,  but it 
        can be done without destroying the connector, if you're VERY 
        VERY careful and if the connector cooperates with you.   You 
        need  to  use  a  screwdriver or something to  lift  up  the 
        locking  parts of the connecter until it comes  apart.   You 
        might  want  to  have  a spare  handy  just  in  case;  I've 
        destroyed  more  than one cable end this  way.   Before  you 
        remove the ends, carefully identify which line goes to pin 6 
        and  which line goes to pin 8 and mark them with a felt  tip 
        pen or something.   THEN remove the connector.  Now you need 
        to  split  the  cable to separate lines 6  and  8  from  the 
        others.   Take line 6 and 8 and exchange their places.   You 
        might  use some tape or something to keep all this stuff  in 
        place  (your  cable  is  now split into  about  5  different 
        parts).   Then carefully align the cable on the disassembled 
        connector,   put  the  connector  top  on,  and  press  them 
        together.  There is a big expensive press used for this, but 
        you can probably make do with a vise and a few small  pieces 
        of wood or whatever else you can think up of.  Make sure you 
        get  the  connector on the right way.   Get it on the  wrong 
        side  of  the cable or turned 180 degrees and  nothing  will

        work.

        Actually, this is such a pain, and so prone to error, that I 
        probably wouldn't attempt it unless there was absolutely  NO 
        other option available. 


        NULL MODEMS and OTHER ADAPTERS

        You  can make an adapter by getting one female and one  male 
        DB-25  connector and some wire.   You can do it with  ribbon 
        cable  by  using  press-on  connectors,  pressing  the  male 
        connector on one end,  then splitting the cable on the other 
        end and doing the funny stuff above to it before pressing on 
        the female end.   Again, it's probably better to use solder-
        on connectors and shielded cable.  

        Connect these pins straight-across:  

             7  Signal Ground
             2  Transmit
             3  Receive
             20 Data Terminal Ready
             4  Request To Send
             5  Clear to Send

        Then  you  will  connect  pin  8 on  the  male  (modem  end) 
        connector  to pin 6 of the female (computer end)  connector.  
        Also,  make  sure  the shield is connected to  both  of  the 
        connector  cases.    Pin 1 of the rs-232 "standard" is  used 
        for   protective ground;  however I'm not sure whether  this 
        should   be connected with the shield or not.   It's been  a 
        while  since  I've make RS-232 cables.   And I hope  a  long 
        while more.

        There  are  also these nice (and usually  expensive)  little 
        boxes  called NULL MODEMS,  which are basically a  switchbox 
        with  a male connector on one end and a female connector  on 
        the other, so you can configure it any way you like.  If you 
        are lucky enough to have one of these, set it up like I just 
        described above.


        GET A BETTER SERIAL CARD

        Not a bad idea at all.  The better serial cards have jumpers 
        on them which allow you to decide which lines are used.  All 
        you  have  to  do to get the serial  card  to  recognize  CD 
        instead  of DSR is move a jumper or two...  We should all be 
        so lucky!


        MODIFY THE SANYO SERIAL CARD

        This is what I chose to do.   The modem cable is build  into 
        my  Anchor,  and I didn't want do tear up that ribbon  cable 
        anyhow.   And  I wanted it done NOW,  not after going to the

        store  for  parts  to  make an  adapter  and  so  on.   This 
        modification  takes  an  exacto  knife,  a  soldering  iron, 
        solder,  and  a  small piece (two inches or so)  of  wire--I 
        prefer wire-wrap wire.

        Take your serial card out of the computer.   Now look at the 
        end of the card where the connecter is soldered to  it.   On 
        the  connecter  all  the holes that the pins  fit  into  are 
        numbered.   Look  for number 6 and number 8.   Follow  these 
        onto the card and see where they connect to it.   On the top 
        of  the board you will see a trace coming from pin  6.   Cut 
        this  trace  with the knife.   Now take a look at where  the 
        trace  goes to.   Holding the card with the  connecter  away 
        from  you and the components on top,  the trace goes to  the 
        NEAR-RIGHT  pin  (pin  1) of the IC at the FAR-LEFT  of  the 
        card.  Turn the board over and solder one end of the wire to 
        that  pin.   Solder the other end to the pad where pin-8  of 
        the  connector comes onto the card and  you`re  done.   This 
        might not seem too clear, but just be careful with following 
        the pins onto the board and so on so you get the right ones.


        DISCLAIMER

        Please  note that I wrote these instructions AFTER THE FACT, 
        so  I cannot guarantee their accuracy.   Also,  as far as  I 
        know all SANYO serial cards are the same,  but there may  be 
        look-alike-but-cost-less  cards  out there that  have  their 
        board laid out differently.  So please be aware.  


                               THE DTR PATCH

        You  will also need a patch for your DOS.   both MS-DOS  and 
        DS-DOS  fool around with the DTR line during disk  accesses, 
        this  is  a  no-no since it causes many modems to  hang  up.  
        There  is  a patch you can get to fix this.   There  is  one 
        patch for MS-DOS 2.11 and another patch for DS-DOS 2.11.  
        This patch only needs to be run once each time you boot,  so 
        you  can put it in your AUTOEXEC file.   it goes by  various  
        names   but  the  ones  I've  seen  are   DTRPATCH.COM   and 
        SYOPATCH.COM.  

        You  can  get  the patch from FIDO #1 or many of  the  SANYO 
        bulletin  boards across the country.   If you can't find  it 
        anywhere  else let me know and I'll send it to  the  Nearest 
        Fido in Your Area via netmail.   It's pretty small anyhow; I 
        think  3k for both the MS-DOS and the DS-DOS version with  a 
        small doc' file.


                            BATCH FILES FOR FIDO

        This is how I set up my RUNBBS.BAT file:

             :LOOP
             FIDO_SYO 128/V 







FIDONEWS     --           06 May 85  00:01:09           Page 13

             IF ERRORLEVEL 1 GOTO EXIT
             GOTO LOOP
             :EXIT

        And the AUTOEXEC.BAT file is something like this:

             DATE
             TIME
             DTRPATCH

        I  also have a LOCAL.BAT which I use to bring up fido in the 
        local mode:

             FIDO_SYO /T


                       THE ANCHOR MODEM'S DTR PROBLEM

        Most modems use DTR to hang up the phone.   The Anchor  Mark 
        XII ignores DTR.  This is a problem because FIDO expects the 
        modem to hang up when DTR is dropped.   Now,  there is a fix 
        (requiring a transistor,  a resister,  and a few minutes) to 
        cause  the  Anchor to use DTR normally.   I haven't done  it 
        yet, but I might.  

        What happens when FIDO is sending netmail and files is  that 
        it  tries to hang up the phone when it is done by using DTR.  
        If it can't,  or if it even suspects that it can't,  it will 
        start  beeping like crazy for you to wake up at 2am and  fix 
        it.   What  a pain,  but it does save you from horrid  phone 
        bills   should   something  happen  to  prevent   a   proper 
        disconnect.    What  I've  noticed  is  that  sometimes  the 
        disconnect will occur but FIDO will wake me up anyhow, while 
        other  times  the disconnect will occur just fine  and  FIDO 
        won't fuss at all.   I don't know why this happens,  but I'm 
        going to modify my modem anyhow to see if it helps. 

        Actually,  what I suspect is happening is that FIDO  toggles 
        DTR to hang up,  waits a few seconds,  then checks to see if 
        the carrier is still there.   If the remote FIDO has hung up 
        by  then (which it usually has) then there's no carrier  and 
        no  problem,  otherwise FIDO does it's beeping  thing...  Of 
        course  while it's beeping away the other computer has  hung 
        up  or the smart commands FIDO issues as a backup have  done 
        their thing,  but FIDO is faithful and wants to protect your 
        phone bill so it wakes you up to make sure.

        You  can get the correct instructions for this fix from  Jon 
        Tara  of FIDO #92.   He also published these instructions in 
        FidoNews 203,  but please be aware that the instructions  as 
        published  in the FidoNews are INCORRECT.   The  corrections 
        were published in FidoNews 315, but it's probably easiest to 
        get  the corrected instructions from #92 directly.   By  the 
        way  if  you  get the corrected  instructions  from  #92,  I 
        wouldn't mind having a copy (hint, hint)...

                           CTTY PROBLEMS (STILL)

        Here's  one I still haven't figured out;  the  CTTY  command 
        will not work properly.  What I did to test it is to connect 
        with  a friend by using the MINITEL communications  program, 
        then  I  dropped  into DOS without losing  the  carrier  and 
        typed

             CTTY AUX: 

        which went over like a led zeppelin.  Didn't accept anything 
        from  my friend or give him anything back.   I don't know if 
        all my patches and mod's had anything to do with it, because 
        I  had  never tried it before I went in with the  knife  and 
        soldering iron.

        I  need for this command to work if I'm going  to  implement 
        FIDO's 0 command to allow the DOS to be run remotely.  Also, 
        I haven't even tried Watchdog to see if it runs on the SANYO 
        but  I really doubt it will.   The Serial port is one of the 
        SANYO's poorest compatibility hangups.

        What  I  might do if nothing else works is to write a  small 
        program  to take the place of the CTTY redirection  and  the 
        watchdog.  Here's my ideas on that so far:

            o Be invoked from the batch file RUNBBS.BAT.

            o Redirect standard console input and output to it's own 
              device  drivers.   The  output driver would  write  to 
              both the local screen and to the remote system.    The 
              input  driver would read from either the  keyboard  or 
              from   the   remote   system.     This   would   allow  
              simultaneous  typing.   Also  you could see  what  the 
              remote Sysop is doing to your poor system...

            o Load  in  a copy of COMMAND.COM and run it  using  the 
              redirected i/o drivers.

            o To  get  back into FIDO,  just type EXIT  which  would 
              return  control  from COMMAND.COM  to  the  supervisor 
              program,  which would then restore the standard output 
              drivers and drop back into the RUNBBS.BAT.

            o The   Supervisor  program  would  check  the   carrier 
              whenever something is output.  If the carrier is lost, 
              then  it  just aborts COMMAND.COM and drops  into  the 
              RUNBBS.BAT.  This  avoids  the rather drastic  re-boot 
              that Watchdog does when it loses the carrier.   It  is 
              important  to  those of us without hardware clocks  to 
              avoid re-booting.

        Of  course this is not a two-hour  project,  especially  for 
        someone  who's never redirected standard output or run  .EXE 
        files from withint a program.  What I'm saying is, if anyone 
        wants  to assist in this endeavor I certainly  won't  refuse 
        the  help.   This  would probably work for the  IBM  without

        A Telecommunications Dictionary
        -------------------------------

           Tom Jennings at one point brainstormed the idea of a 
        "telecommunications dictionary," essentially using the known 
        frequent content of BBS information to reduce the time it 
        takes to transfer text from a BBS to the user's system.  

           The basic idea is that frequently-used words or 
        substrings (words like "message" or "the") could be encoded 
        in two bytes instead of sending the full strings. If the 
        'dictionary' were flexible enough, it might include an 
        entire screenful of information encoded as two bytes (a 
        standard menu or help screen, for example, or a log-on 
        logo).  

           I toyed with the ideas, and juggled with some of them a 
        bit, and wrote a quick and dirty program to test the basic 
        theory.  While Tom had the idea of a "learning dictionary" 
        in which the user's software could learn new encoded strings 
        from the host as necessary (and in which each host would use 
        a different dictionary), I tended toward the idea of a 
        "standard" string dictionary.  
           
           By way of background: standard "squeeze" programs use 
        something called Huffman coding to encode strings by using 
        fewer bits to encode characters which occur more frequently. 
        Huffman coding doesn't work with interactive text because 
        (a) it works best on long, arbitrary text files, and (b) 
        Huffman coding abandons the meaning of byte boundaries, so 
        that one dropped bit in a transmission means the entire file 
        is lost unless some sort of error detection and correction 
        (ECC) is included. ECC eats up as much or more bits than are 
        saved.  
           
           My approach was to examine text files containing captured 
        message bases from a Fido BBS and several other on-line 
        systems.  I analyzed the text [using a program quickly 
        written in Turbo Pascal] and found 32 strings (4-, 5- and 6-
        bytes long) which occurred very frequently. A 
        telecommunications "dictionary set" might include 256 words 
        in each of several dictionaries; in theory, system-specific 
        dictionaries might exist (Fido, CompuServe, etc.).  

           My dictionary program replaced strings like " the " 
        (space,t,h,e,space) and "ing " (i,n,g,space) as two-byte 
        codes.  Rather than write a complete BBS and telecomm 
        software to test the theory, my program merely encoded the 
        information from one file into another file. A real 
        telecommunications dictionary would have to do this encoding 
        (at the host end) and decoding (on the user's end) "on the 
        fly," adding a number of potential problems if existing 
        telecomm software is running at or near the capacity of the 
        CPU.

           My dictionary program, using 32 strings of length 4-, 5-, 
        and 6-, re-coded those strings as two-byte codes: a prefix 
        byte (with a value greater than 128) and a suffix byte from 
        0..31. A "full" telecommunications dictionary would do the 
        same but might work from as many as 127 dictionaries (using 
        the full range of the prefix byte) and as many as 256 words 
        in each dictionary, or over 32,000 possible strings.  

           The result: By encoding the 32 most-frequent strings, I 
        reduced the file size -- which would translate to 
        transmission time -- by almost exactly ten percent. That 10% 
        savings was constant over about a half-dozen files, ranging 
        from Fido messages to a news column I was writing.  

           I would estimate that a "generalized" dictionary of 256 
        words might save around 15%. To obtain any significant 
        savings from the encoding, a system-specific dictionary 
        (i.e. Tom's "learning" dictionary, or a Fido-specific 
        dictionary) or a very large standard dictionary would have 
        to be used. [An important aspect of this is that use of a 
        single, standard 128-word dictionary by encoding into one 
        byte rather than two would save about 25%, but that savings 
        could never be enhanced later.] 

           Savings are always enhanced by encoding long strings 
        instead of short strings (i.e. if "message" occurs often and 
        is encoded, you save more bytes than by encoding "the").  

           A note: software which used some sort of dictionary-
        coding to save on transmission time would have to "register" 
        its capability during or after sign-on, so that BBSs or 
        services with the dictionary available could still default 
        to a "dumb terminal" mode. If the software used a "learning 
        dictionary," it would have to be able to signal "I don't 
        know that word" at any time; the host would then download 
        the word to be added to the system's dictionary. Most 
        essential: all of this ought to be automatic, transparent to 
        the user.  

           I'd like to know if anyone else is interested in 
        following up on this idea of a "telecommunications 
        dictionary," and what people's ideas are on this. This was 
        Tom's brainstorm but he had other projects and has put it on 
        the shelf; likewise, I'm not actively pursuing it further 
        right now, but thought I should contribute my experience to 
        other telecommunicators. Please let me know if there's 
        interest in this topic; send Fido mail to me at Fido #459 
        (415-391-0556 6pm-9am PST only), or write to me c/o 425 
        Battery St., 4th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94111.

        From: Tim Meyers, Fido #365

            Dated April 25,1985.
            Tim Meyers
            Techn-Source Systems Group.

            Dear Mr. Meyers:

            Thank  you  for  your  interest  in  becoming  a service 
            provider for Compuserve.  The first step to becoming  an 
            information  provider or a system operator for a Special 
            Interest  Group  is  the  preparation  of   a   proposal 
            describing the proposed service.  

        Taken  from  a  recent  letter  I  received  from Compuserve 
        Information Services,  a proposal to start a Special Intrest 
        Group  for  Fido.  It  will be labeled as (GO FID-1) when it 
        arrives,  but first I have to know exactly how  many  people 
        would be interested.  

        My  company  will  invest $5,000 for the initial fee for the 
        creation of the database and files.  After  which  point  it 
        becomes the property of me, and or whoever wants it.  

        I  have  typed  a  proposal  to  Compuserve and should get a 
        response within 60 days.  I spent about 20 hours on the work 
        of menus, methods, promotional plans, target market, current 
        projection,  overview  of  information etc.  etc.  Now it is 
        completed and I hope that I haven't wasted my time.  Here is 
        a brief review of what will be on the SIG: 

            1st,  the  newsletter.  At  this  point  in time several 
            people are just not receiving the newsletter.  It's very 
            large to download and many people just cannot access the 
            larger  systems  that  have  it  online.  The newsletter 
            would linked to a electronic magazine,  in  which  menus 
            serve  as  the "Table of Contents" and point to articles 
            that have been written.  It  works  very  well  for  the 
            needs of both users and sysops.  

            2nd.  Mr.  Jennings  would create a nice little "Welcome 
            to the Fido  Special  Interest  Group".  Just  a  simple 
            letter  explaining what Fido is,  what's so unique about 
            it, etc.  

            3rd.  Users Questions Answered.  That's it,  the biggest 
            problem  at  this  point  in the network.  It would be a 
            great place for all questions and answer to be placed at 
            Compuserve's cost. Everyone has asked for it, now anyone 
            that wishes to chip in  can.  Questions  answered  in  a 
            day,  No  more  100  calls to Tom Jennings.  Keeps small 
            questions like "What do I  do  with  this  modem?"  from 
            costing  Mr.  Jennings 25 cents.  Etc.  Etc.  Etc.  I am 
            sure you can see the need for it.  At this point  mostly 







FIDONEWS     --           06 May 85  00:01:24           Page 19

            all new sysops questions are addressed to Mr.  Jennings. 
            This  way  anyone  that has an answer can solve somone's 
            problem.  Not just sysops but from a  user's  standpoint 
            also.  

            4th.  Software. Every single software program related to 
            Fido  will  be  placed on the system.  A message will be 
            placed for which version is  the  newest,  when  updated 
            etc.  I made three phone calls tonight,  one to node #1, 
            got the newsletter, one to #375 for this article, one to 
            51 for the TWIX program.  When I could  have  made  just 
            one call to Compuserve, and it's a local charge.  

            This  could  solve  lots  of problems with disk space on 
            most systems,  although  I  am  sure  many  sysops  will 
            continue to keep Fido software online, they can at least 
            have  a common conference area.  It's a place to keep in 
            touch.  

            5th.  The Nodelist,  Each week it could be  put  online.  
            Instead  of  spending  the  many hours of re-dialing and 
            busy signals you would be able to obtain it whenever you 
            wished.  I am sure the sysops of fido #50 would see  the 
            need of this.  

            6th.  What  does  it  cost?  Well  there  is  a one time 
            connection fee and several other addition cost, but I am 
            signing  the  check  here.  I  will  sign  a  check  for 
            $5,000.00  to  form  the  Fido  SIG  if I receive enough 
            interest in the project.  I wish to help the many  other 
            sysops  and future sysops of Fido,  including the users.  
            We need somthing like this.  The problem  is,  how  many 
            people  would  be  interested?  With  over 250 nodes and 
            growing, again it's needed.  

        My Plan of attack? What is my attitude?  Well here are a few 
        simple figures: 

        Fido  SIG  operates at 10% royalty rate.  If Each node had a 
        cumulative of 60 minutes in the SIG it  would  have  approx.  
        253  hours  of  use.  This is resonable since many SIGs draw 
        less than 100 hours a month,  which is a useful  amount.  At 
        253  hours  a  month,  Compuserve  will be happy to let Fido 
        remain on the system But if it falls to less than 25  hours, 
        I start paying $750.00 a month.  That's a chance I will have 
        to take,  but first I have to consider how many  people  use 
        the system.  

        1) Each node -- users, sysop, etc.  -- spend 2 minutes a day 
           on the Fido SIG and we have our goal.  


        2) Half the nodes spend 2 minutes and we have 2/3 our goal.  

        3) 50 nodes spend 2 minutes on the SIG and I have  to  spend 
           about  $115.00.  Not  bad,  At  least we have provided as 
           much information and equipment that we can to make Fido a
