     The article concerning the soon-to-be-published book about Fidonet
     which your editor... uh... misplaced last week appears in this
     issue.  Thanks to Amir Shabashvili for taking the time and trouble
     to send me this article again.

     =================================================================
                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================


                              King Bob the First
                                  Doug Myers

     A while back, I defended a column in Fidonews which paid respect to
     American servicemen.  Readers advised me that I should adopt a more
     international point of view as editor of the Snooze, that highly
     respected publication of the world.

     I've been trying really hard, though I've got to admit that I took
     in the fireworks on the 4th of July, and I still occasionally slip
     and order a piece of apple pie when I'm dining out (this despite the
     fact that apple pie is not only considered an "American" dish, but
     the doctors would be sure to tell me it isn't recommended for the
     diabetes).

     In full realization that I'd need to do something proactive if I
     were going to adjust my attitude to one of a more international
     bent, I decided to brush up on my British heritage by watching "King
     Ralph" on one of the cable channels which runs old movies.  The
     movie opens with the entire British Monarchy assembled at an outdoor
     function during a rain storm.  As the rain clears, the entire Royal
     Family poses for a photograph, only to be electrocuted by a mishap
     involving an electrical feed drenched by a rain puddle.  A search of
     the Windsor lineage reveals that the only surviving heir to the
     bloodline is the chronically unemployed American, Ralph, who is more
     at home in bars and strip joints than at a Royal Function.

     Everything got straightened out in the end, but the rest of the
     story is irrelevant to this editorial.  What I want to report is the
     "International Deep Thoughts" which inspired me as I viewed this
     epic.

     It occurred to me that Fidonet is in the same predicament which
     plagued England in the time when the Monarchy ruled... no one really
     hated the Monarchy, but people everywhere gotta be free.

     Fido is in that predicament right now:  sysops want to determine
     their own course, but no one wants to rewrite Policy 4.  Folks want
     an active International Coordinator, but no one wants to overthrow
     the old one.  Why can't we use the same methods England did to
     resolve this conflict - declare a Constitutional Monarchy?  Long live
     King Bob the First and his heirs, but let the _real_ government rest
     in the hands of the Commoners?

     I've got to admit that I'm a little shakey on exactly how this was
     accomplished, but the scholars among us can arrange the necessary
     details.  I think I saw the basic process on an old Robin Hood movie
     when I was a kid... didn't one of the Merry Men force the King at
     sword's end to sign the Emancipation Proclamation, thus ushering in
     the peaceful transition of the British Empire from an absolute
     monarchy to a constitutional monarchy with an elected House of
     FIDONEWS 17-38               Page 3                   18 Sep 2000


     Commons in charge, and a Prime Minister as the _real_ chief
     executive?

     Such a solution would be perfect!  The mistrusted "Good Ol' Boys
     Network" would suddenly be transformed to "Defenders of the Faith,"
     keeping the royal bloodlines pure and serving as models of decorum
     for us all.  In the meantime, an elected Parliament of Common Sysops
     could change the Law of the Land at will, free from the ceremonial
     functions which stifle action in Fido.

     All the world over, it's so easy to see...
     People everywhere just wanna be free.

     God Save King Bob, the First of the House of Satti!

                          In Memory of Kent Anderson

     Jim McQueen (1:396/45.8) offers the following in support of the
     editorial on Kent Anderson's passing:


     The fall gave us thorns to pierce us,
     but God placed a rose on top to grace us.
     Oft do the sharp things in life cause us pain,
     but look to the rose and you will find joy again.

     Well, its done! The Fido-book last 3 years I've been worked on will
     be published in September, 2000. Of cource, it is in Russian -
     sorry, but it is't good idea to publish English books in Russia, I
     guess:)

     If you ask me, - "why you did this stupud job!?" - I can't
     explain... Yes, it was horoble job and I lost a lot of quality time
     for my family/kids, but... this was a book exactly I needed at one
     time:)

     Fido in Russia still grow fast, and I hope, this book will be
     popular and will not be useless.

     I wanna give my thanks and congratulations to thouse who help me in
     my job, especially to Dmitry Zavalishin, 2:5020/32.

                              FN_SYSOP Election

     As reported previously in Fidonews, the election for moderator of
     FN_SYSOP is underway.  Right now, this echo for sysops is in the
     nomination phase.  Originally, nominations were to be completed by
     September 15th, but Carol Shenkenberger, the election coordinator,
     has extended the nomination period.  Carol will be out of town
     during the next week, but has promised to review the echo and accept
     nominations and seconds upon her return.  All nodelisted sysops are
     eligible to vote in this election, and any may be nominated for
     candidacy as moderator.

     Here are the candidates so far:

     Candidates meeting all requirements to run for election as of this

     post:

     Darrell Salter 1:229/1
     Joe Delahaye, 1:249/303
     Michael Grant, 1:134/11

     Candidates lacking only acceptance to run:

     Ward Dossche, 2:292/854
     Richard Bowermaster, 1:363/167
     Bob Seaborn, 1:140/12

     Bob Seaborn has declined the nomination as Fidonews went to press,
     and Douglas Myers, the current moderator, previously announced that
     he wouldn't seek a third term.

                                Another Tip...
                        Echomail posted by Jim McQueen
                        (1:396/45.8) in FIDONEWS echo


     Heigh folks! Good to get back to you again. My last tip was on how
     to use the free media to get more exposure, and attract new users.
     Possibly to even generate some new Points or Nodes. Well I've got
     one more tip for you. Well it's a question and a tip at the same
     time. Maybe we could start a new echo called FIDOTIPS, for the
     discussion of promoting Fidonet.

     I've been noticing the same thing you've been noticing. More and
     more Fidonauts have been bemoaning the free flight from Fido to the
     I'net. Well have you read the echolist lately? Stop for a moment and
     look through it again for a second. Most all of what you see there
     is;

     Computer platforms
     Operating systems
     Fidonet software applications
     Hardware applications
     Software applications
     Hobbies
     Politics
     Special interests
     Soapboxes

     That's not all conclusive but you get my drift. Read through it
     again a couple of times. Notice something? Most people don't care
     FIDONEWS 17-38               Page 8                   18 Sep 2000


     about these sorts of things on a daily basis. What people care about
     is what they do every day. That's the fabric of life. Well guess who
     those people are? They're me and you. Maybe we aren't attracting new
     customers because we aren't being very interesting.

     What if each one of us took a good look at ourselves and started a
     new echo about what's important to us. Or what we're doing every
     day. See what I mean? There's enough of us in every part of the
     world, that we make up a very acceptable cross section of all
     peoples. You know what they say; you build a better mouse trap, and
     the world will beat a path to your door. Look at yourself and your
     life. What's important to you? Get a handle on it and start an echo.
     There are lots of people out there like you. Go for it, and draw
     them in.

     Okay now for my question. If I am really interested in a certain
     widget, or maybe I know a lot about a certain widget. Can I start an
     echo up for my interest? Is it just a matter of sending a MOD UPD
     for the new echo, as thought it were an old one being renewed?

     As we speak, the Olympic torch is being carried througout all the
     land. Let us carry the torch of Fidonet in this same tradition. Go
     forth people, and be creative!

                                  COLUMNS
     =================================================================


                               Ol'WDB's Column
                             wdbonner@pacbell.com
                             All on a Dollar Bill


     Have a dollar bill handy when you read this to really get the
     message.

     Take out a one dollar bill and look at it. The one dollar bill
     you're looking at first came off the presses in 1957 in its present
     design. This so-called paper money is in fact a cotton and linen
     blend, with red and blue minute silk fibers running through it. It
     is actually material. We've all washed it without it falling apart.
     A special blend of ink is used, the contents we will never know.

     It is overprinted with symbols and then it is starched to make it
     water resistant and pressed to give it that nice crisp look. If you
     look on the front of the bill, you will see the United States
     Treasury Seal. On the top you will see the scales for the balance--a
     balanced budget. In the center you have a carpenter's T-square, a
     tool used for an even cut. Underneath is the Key to the United
     States Treasury. That's all pretty easy to figure out, but what is
     on the back of that dollar bill is something we should all know.

     If you turn the bill over, you will see two circles. Both circles,
     together, comprise the Great Seal of the United States. The First
     Continental Congress requested that Benjamin Franklin and a group of
     men come up with a Seal. It took them four years to accomplish this
     task and another two years to get it approved. If you look at the
     left hand circle, you will see a Pyramid. Notice the face is lighted
     and the western side is dark. This country was just beginning. We
     had not begun to explore the West or decided what we could do for
     Western Civilization. The Pyramid is un-capped, again signifying
     that we were not even close to being finished. Inside the capstone
     you have the all-seeing eye, an ancient symbol for divinity. It was
     Franklin's belief that one man couldn't do it alone, but a group of
     men, with the help of God, could do anything.

     "IN GOD WE TRUST" is on this currency. The Latin above the pyramid,
     ANNUIT COEPTIS, means "God has favored our undertaking." The Latin
     below the pyramid, NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM, means "a new order has
     begun." At the base of the pyramid is the Roman Numeral for 1776.

     If you look at the right-hand circle, and check it carefully, you
     will learn that it is on every National Cemetery in the United
     States. It is also on the Parade of Flags Walkway at the Bushnell,
     Florida National Cemetery and is the centerpiece of most hero's
     monuments. Slightly modified, it is the seal of the President of the
     United States and it is always visible whenever he speaks, yet no
     one knows what the symbols mean. The Bald Eagle was selected as a
     symbol for victory for two reasons: first, he is not afraid of a
     FIDONEWS 17-38               Page 10                  18 Sep 2000


     storm; he is strong and he is smart enough to soar above it.
     Secondly, he wears no material crown. We had just broken from the
     King of England.

     Also, notice the shield is unsupported. This country can now stand
     on its own. At the top of that shield you have a white bar
     signifying congress, a unifying factor. We were coming together as
     one nation. In the Eagle's beak you will read, "E PLURIBUS UNUM",
     meaning "one nation from many people."

     Above the Eagle you have thirteen stars representing the thirteen
     original colonies, and any clouds of misunderstanding rolling away.
     Again, we were coming together as one. Notice what the Eagle holds
     in his talons. He holds an olive branch and arrows. This country
     wants peace, but we will never be afraid to fight to preserve peace.
     The Eagle always wants to face the olive branch, but in time of war,
     his gaze turns toward the arrows.

     They say that the number 13 is an unlucky number. This is almost a
     worldwide belief. You will usually never see a room numbered 13, or
     any hotels or motels with a 13th floor. But think about this: 13
     original colonies, 13 signers of the Declaration of Independence, 13
     stripes on our flag, 13 steps on the Pyramid, 13 letters in the
     Latin above, 13 letters in "E Pluribus Unum", 13 stars above the
     Eagle, 13 plumes of feathers on each span of the Eagle's wing, 13
     bars on that shield, 13 leaves on the olive branch, 13 fruits, and
     if you look closely, 13 arrows. And for minorities: the 13th
     Amendment.

     I always ask people, "Why don't you know this?" Your children don't
     know this and their history teachers don't know this. Too may
     veterans have given up too much to ever let the meaning fade. Many
     veterans remember coming home to an America that didn't care. Too
     many veterans never came home at all.

     Tell everyone what is on the back of the one dollar bill and what
     it stands for, because, likely no one else will.

                                 Which Barbie
                              Thanks to Roy Reed

     Ralph was driving home one evening when he suddenly realizes that
     it's his daughter's birthday and he hasn't bought her a present.
     He drives to the toy shop, runs to the toy store and says to the
     shop assistant, "How much is that Barbie in the window?"

     In a condescending manner, she says "Which Barbie?"

     She continues, "We have Barbie Goes to the Gym for $19.95, Barbie
     Goes to the Ball for $19.95, Barbie Goes Shopping for $19.95, Barbie
     Goes to the Beach for $19.95, Barbie Goes Nightclubbing for $19.95,
     and Divorced Barbie for $265.00".

     Ralph asks, "Why is the Divorced Barbie $265.00 when all the others
     are only $19.95?"

     "That's obvious" the sales lady says. "Divorced Barbie comes with
     Ken's house, Ken's car, Ken's boat, Ken's furniture..."

     a @ preceding an individual's name implies a virtual email
     address. The email is translated as follows
     firstlast@osirusoft.com will automatically route to the
     appropriate individual's email.  Anyone in this list will
     also receive routed notice of this feature.  In my case, it
     would still be joejared@osirusoft.com, but you get the idea.

     Also, as information is provided to me, I will be adding a
     latency field to each node, which is defined as the maximum
     time between when the message is received, and when it is
     sent on to other nodes, or available to be sent onward,
     defined in minutes. A latency of ! implies that there is an
     immediate response, and an attempt to deliver immediately
     after processing, or a "MinuteMail System", as it were.

                         Changes to Internet Listing

     Jan Vermeulen (2:280/100) informs us of the following change to the
     Fidonews Internet listings:

     the Zone 2 entry as in FidoNews Vol 17 Number 29:
     "284/800   @ Jeroen VanDeLeur  | FTP,UUE        | 64k   | n/c"
     should be changed to
     "280/1601  @ Jeroen VanDeLeur  | FTP,UUE        | 64k   | n/c"
     as the former number will soon disappear from the Nodelist.


     Eugene Horosheff (pluto@uralan.ru) informs us that the following new
     site is now available:

     Zone 2, region 50, net 5074:
     http://www.z2.n5074.fidonet.net


     These changes have been added to the Fidonet Internet listings
     (thanks Joe)!
