Editorial: FidoCon and stuff
Tom Jennings

This coming weekend is the International Fido Con (well, the
North American version anyways). If you haven't heard about it,
why not?! Following this dull, witless editorial rambling is info
on FidoCon.

Since both Tim Pozar (the other editor, remember him?) and I will
be attending FidoCon, there won't be anyone here to put together
FidoNews on Sunday night. Instead, I will produce a truncated
version on Wednesday, which will (hopefully) ship out
automatically Sunday. (If something fails, I'll be back in San
Francisco late Monday night.) Only Murphy can predict, and he's
not talking.

See you at FidoCon! Be there or be somewhere else!

An apology to the authors of the UFOlogy article ran last week.
It should not have been placed in the Rants 'n' Flames section,
which is reserved for complaints about complaints about
complaints about... I intended to place it towards the end of the
articles section. Sorry!

re: New Jersey's programmer-licensing proposal

Return-Path: <gnu@toad.com>

I can't believe all the people who are posting in RISKS that they like
the idea of government mandated licensing of the software craft.  (I
don't care if you call it designing, engineering, programming, or hacking.)
What ever happened to the idea of freedom of speech in software?

Maybe I'm just an old-timer, but while "some of my best friends" came
into software through traditional college courses, most of the best,
brightest, and most inventive programmers I know became programmers
without formal training.  The fathers of the computer revolution you
are now staring at and typing to, were able to make the great strides
they did, in an incredibly short period of time as measured against any
other industry, because there was nobody to say "no, you can't do
that".  Why would anyone who has the equipment and training that
permits them to read this message, want to squelch such creativity and
FidoNews 8-32                  Page 6                      12 Aug 1991


productivity gains for the entire society?

I've heard all the drivel about raising standards and driving out the
low quality practitioners.  Right.  What it really does it makes it
more painful for *everyone* to enter the industry -- the best *and* the
worst.  It creates a monopoly, ruled by an old boys' "board of
licensing" who entrench their idea of proper programming.  It's a good
thing this bill didn't pass during the "Goto considered harmful" phase,
or it might have ended up "Goto considered illegal" and stuck us
programming in Pascal forever.  (I also note that the explosion of C
programming in the last ten years was mostly among people on micros who
typically hadn't programmed before.  E.g. if you were required to go
through college to be allowed to try C, you wouldn't bother, since the
college courses of the time taught Pascal and Fortran; you'd have
already been taught how to constrain your thinking to what was possible
in inferior languages.)

By the way, I never went to college at all.  Among the three
co-founders of my current successful software startup company, only one
of us has a degree - and it isn't in computers (I think it's history).
And while I am really very talented with computers, if continuing to
work with them means getting a government license, I'll just retire on
what I've already made in computers, and start exploring one of the
other ten or twelve things I've never had time for.  I mean, we turn
down government contracts now just over the added paperwork!

Did you notice in the bill that it allows people to gain a license to
be a programmer even if they don't go to an "approved" college?  But it
requires years of work experience -- which will be illegal to get after
the bill passes.  Essentially a grandfather clause disguised as an
alternative route.  It means that the bright kids and 20 year olds and
30 year olds who currently wander into programming from chemistry or
physics or MCAD or library science, or bartending (I know a few!), will
be banned from the industry.  I'd really rather not replace these
talented, motivated people with drones who learned how to take tests
and warmed a seat in some state college for four years.  We need more
interdisciplinary people already -- you want to cut the supply to a
tiny trickle of those who're willing to sit through two or three entire
courses of formal study?

My reaction to the NJ bill was:  O boy.  Now the programmers will all
get upset at it, and not only can we kill off this stupid bill, but
perhaps while we're incensed, we can even repeal some of the other
ridiculous occupational licensing that's already on the books -- like
hairdressers, barbers, car mechanics, etc.

If you really care about this issue, I recommend that you implement it
in your personal life without waiting for the government.  Only buy
computers designed by licensed and bonded EE's.  (Hint:  your
SPARCstation is not one of them.)  Only buy software that was written
by programmers who passed the CDP exam.  (Better send back Unix, Emacs,
Lotus 1-2-3, and Usenet.)  I don't think TCP/IP was designed by
registered communications engineers either.  (Maybe OSI was -- it has
that smell.)  Well, you can always run DOS -- ahem -- uh, Bill Gates
*started* college, but I don't think he ever finished it.  Too busy
making better products than all those people who wasted four years.
FidoNews 8-32                  Page 7                      12 Aug 1991


But maybe he *hired* a lot of fully certified licensed degreed people
to write the code.  Or maybe not.

Don't forget to restrict your reading to government-approved
writers, and your thinking to government-approved thoughts.

Sometimes I think the worst mistake the founders of our country made
was giving governments the power to control commerce and trade.

Abstract: BOARDWATCH Magazine
by Tom Jennings

BOARDWATCH magazine is a print-only publication edited and published by
Jack Rickard, out of Littleton Colorado. Calling itself a "Guide to the
world of online services", it is the only print publication to ever cover
the BBS world with any accuracy and credibility. Everyone else who's
attempted it has failed miserably; BOARDWATCH not only works, but is
actually informative and fun to read.

The July 91 issue is somewhat typical, though there's a lot of emphasis on
FidoCon that'd make a first-time reader think it was a "FidoNet" magazine.
BOARDWATCH frequently has *something* about FidoNet, since we're a
significant fraction of the BBSs out there, but the emphasis this month is
a bit heavy of course.

The format is more or less comfortably predictable -- table of contents
(samples: DOS 5.0 Lives; 9600bps Modem price breaks $300; List of Sysop
modem discount programs; USWest Intro to Caller ID; Adapter links laptops
to LANs via parallel port; Bell Atlantic to roll out ISDN-1; New book on
electronic commerce; Multitech adds UUCP to V.32 modems; ...), and
editorial, articles, rumors & news column, product announcements, a regular
COMMUNICATIONS BASICS column by our very own Alan Appelgate, a list of BBS
lists(!), classifieds, and somewhat less than the usual ratio of text/ads.

The FidoCon-specific content in this issue includes: an official
announcement from the FidoCon putter-onners, Alan's column is about store
and forward (ie. FidoNet style) e-mail and FidoNet topology, how-to-join
FidoNet (amazing! someone wrote it down!), a COORD list (with permission),
dirt and rumors and various commentary.

Jack also has a distinct editorial voice throught the magazine -- always
opinionated, but noticeably open and inclusive. There's enough personality
to keep it human and provide a context for his writing, something
completely forgotten and lost in most so-called "professional"
publications. I'm told Jack will be attending FidoCon (lucky for him he
lives in the state).

    The Collector's Corner Echo is for those who collect things.
"Collect what?", you may ask.  Well, anything, ranging from
coins to baseball cards to comic books to stamps to different
types of art.  ANY type collectibles may be discussed.

     If you are asking yourself "Where can I get more
information on it?", or are simply wondering what kind of person
talks to themself while they read FidoNews, then read on!

     If you want more information, contact me at 1:141/745,
26:1203/1, 31:4033/301, 57:2300/101, 91:203/2, or 99:9335/1.
The echo currently reaches the following known areas:

+---------------+---------------+---------+----------------+
| Connecticut:  | Pennsylvania: | Kansas: | Massachusetts: |
+---------------+---------------+---------+----------------+
| Brookfield    | Yardley       | Luther  | West Newton    |

     If you're interested in getting this echo, or just want
information, please let me know, or ask your local Collector's
Corner Echo carrier to add you to his AREAS.BBS.  It's still a
small echo, and thus inexpensive to carry.

     Thank you for your time, and I hope you've found the echo
you'll next add onto your BBS (I also hope it's the one I just
advertised...<grin>).

Decentralizing the Nodelist
by D.J. Murdoch,
1:221/177.40 (1:163/140.3 in September)

In Fidonews 0829 and 0831 Richard Bash argued for splitting off the
U.S. part of the nodelist from the rest, since the vast majority of
sysops don't need or want the full megabyte of nodes.  I've felt this
problem acutely myself - I'm the unlisted Canadian he quoted, and I
run a single user point system on an old XT clone with no disk space
to spare.  However, his proposal would do nothing to help me; I call
U.S. sites occasionally, so I'd need both parts.

In the netmail that he quoted, I outlined the beginning of an idea for
a much bigger and more effective split.  In thinking about it for a
couple of weeks, I've convinced myself that the idea would not only be
good if implemented, it wouldn't be all that painful to implement:
let's decentralize the nodelist.

Decentralizing means splitting it up, but into many more than the two
pieces that Mr. Bash proposed.  I think we should aim to have the
nodelist split into a separate piece for every component net.  To tie
them together, the main nodelist would only need to contain net hosts,
regional hosts, and gateways.  (I've probably forgotten one or two
other exceptions, but you get the idea.)  Doing this to the current
nodelist reduces it to about 40K!

Every node would keep a copy of the drastically reduced main nodelist
and as many local net lists as they want to call.  In my case, that's
two or three local nets; altogether, the parts I use add up to less
than 60K.

Which local nets do you need?  Only the ones with nodes that you want
to call directly.  That probably means one or two that are a local
call for you, and any nets with nodes that you want to be able to Freq
from.  Netmail doesn't need any:  assuming that all net hosts will
forward netmail, the reduced main nodelist would be good enough to
send netmail anywhere in the net in a single call.

What if you want to call a system in a net whose list you don't have?
You'd Freq the local net list from the net host (it's probably under
10K, less if compressed) and use it to make the call.

FidoNews 8-32                  Page 10                     12 Aug 1991


As I say above, this will need some relatively painless changes to
current practice.  First of all, participation could be entirely
voluntary.  It's very easy to write software to shrink the full
nodelist; I've done it myself.  Nodelist compilers would have to be
modified to be able to accept several inputs, but that shouldn't be
hard, and because participation would be voluntary, not everyone in a
net would need to switch.

NCs would have to make their nodelist segment available for Freq; this
would be a new duty for them.  Since they already have to prepare the
segment, I don't think it would be much extra work.  Perhaps in the
initial stages a flag could be added to the host entry to indicate
that the list is available; if not, the RC should be able to supply a
regional list.

In the later stages NCs might maintain local NODEDIFF files to help
long distance callers who want to keep up to date. (Would we call them
NETDIFFs?  They'd be only a few lines long.) I imagine BBS systems
with big file collections would also keep up to date copies of the
local list available, so one manual call would be enough to get both
the nodelist segment and whatever file you want; after that, calls
could be automatic.

I think Richard Bash had a good idea when he suggested splitting the
nodelist.  But why stop at two parts?

Cyclic discussion: every now and again, usually being when the Nodelist
breaks some psychologically important barrier (10k nodes, won't fit
ZIPped onto a 360k floppy any more, 1 meg raw in size), someone brings
up a way to cut down the size of the thing.

Suggested have been:

 -- binary format nodelist.

 -- Aaron Goldblatt's Ft Worth nodelist format.

 -- dropping N nodes on X criterion

Trimming entries from the nodelist is IMHO a Bad Idea. Nobody wants to
be zapped, there are some people that shouldn't be zapped that will be
zapped by one or more of the selected criterion. An example is that some
gateways (which are marked pvt for technical reasons) are a) important
to have in the nodelist, and b) would get cut by all these people
shouting "wow, we can cut 400 or so entries by dropping -Pvt- systems!".

FidoNews 8-32                  Page 11                     12 Aug 1991


Personally, I'm in favour of either of the first two options. They cut
down the sheer volume of nodelist being carted around -- the former by
representing the information in a more compact manner, and the latter
largely by discarding "unimportant" information. The good thing about
this kind of idea is that it's relatively easy to convert either of the
compact nodelist formats to an old-style nodelist for people with old
software.

The problem is that the software never turned up. Alan suggested the
binary nodelist, but I never saw anything to handle binary nodediffs or
convert binary nodelists into normal ones. Aaron's suggestion was cute,
but the software didn't turn up there, either.

Alan, Aaron, anyone else who's invented a new nodelist format, if you're
reading -- hey, come up with some software, eh? And if it's already
around, make it a bit more visible? :-)

===

Glenn Caleval -- well said, Centurion! Not that I entirely agree with
you, but you've been a hell of a lot more succint in putting your point
forward than a few other people :-).

            UPDATE ON WORLDPOL 2 - THE WORLDPOL ECHO

After the publication of WorldPol 2 on FidoNews a couple of
months ago, an extraordinary amount of feedback was received at
4:4/50 from people that formerly opposed the document, and others
that had not been involved before.

I had to put a delay on WorldPol development while I relocated
from Buenos Aires to Los Angeles. I have not replied to all the
letters received since the end of May, but I surely brought
copies of them to my new location, and will be contacting the
originators individually during the next weeks. Positively,
things look ready as to start the WORLDPOL echo in order to
expand participation or at least, make it more accessible.

WORLDPOL will not be in the Zone-1 echomail backbone for the time
being. It will be a moderated conference and will be distributed
independently throughout the world by volunteers. This way, we
avoid the controversial Echopol and at the same time no FidoNet
coordinator will be in the position of interfering in any way
with the echo's traffic.

FidoNews 8-32                  Page 12                     12 Aug 1991


The primary purpose of the WORLDPOL echo is to allow a broader
participation, as well as the possibility of publicly making
suggestions to modify the document that can be openly discussed
by everyone that's interested.

Our immediate goal is to release an updated version of WorldPol
around October. As always, you are invited to participate by
netmail, and now too by carrying the WORLDPOL echo. Regarding
this last point, I will be organizing distribution of the echo
worldwide during the next days.

The WORLDPOL echo will be centered at 1:102/631 and available at
this source as well as at 4:4/50. Hopefully, we will have the
echo available at several locations in Zone-1 and Zone-4, as well
as in the other zones. If you are interested in becoming part of
the independent distribution system for WORLDPOL, please contact
me at 1:102/631.

Thanks for your attention, and I hope that more and more people
get involved in giving our network the viable policy document it
needs and now lacks, in the near future. WorldPol 2 is available
for request at 1:102/631 (phone 1-213-842-3938, 9600 HST CM) with
the magic name WORLDPOL.

 INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM,

 -----------------------------------------------------

SaudiNet was formed in the midst of a crisis developing in the
Middle East, this crisis is now known as the War in the Persian
Gulf.  The intent of this project was to provide a quick,
efficient way to get letters, in the form of electronic mail, to
troops stationed in the Persian Gulf.  These letters, from
family members and well wishers, are entered on a personal
computer equipped with a modem while "online" with a computer
Bulletin Board System (BBS).  There were some systems around the
country that operated on a "stand alone" basis.  Schools and
libraries etc.  participated in SaudiNet.  These computer
Bulletin Board Systems operate voluntarily.  The System
Operators (SysOps) who maintain these systems give a large
amount of their time and money for toll calls, maintenence etc.
to provide this service, free of charge, to the public.  These
individual systems and the people who run them are the very
backbone of the entire operation.  Without them, this great
effort known as SaudiNet, would not be able to run.  As with all
projects of this scope, SaudiNet has had its growing pains.  As
FidoNews 8-32                  Page 13                     12 Aug 1991


problems arose however, they have been dealt with in a manner
befitting commercial organizations.

There are still nearly 45,000 troops stationed in and around the
Persian Gulf Theatre of Operations, and mail continues to flow
from systems who belong to SaudiNet, to a Bulletin Board System
(BBS) in Saudi Arabia, where they are printed out, stapled and
turned over to the Military Post Office.  Here in this country,
plans are underway to expand the present operation to include
crises areas around the world.  SaudiNet remains an ongoing
project, as long as need be, under the direction of a
not-for-profit corporation called the International Public
Emergency Communications System Incorporated (IPECS Inc.).

This corporation is already unique.  The members of SaudiNet are
at this time electing representatives from their respective
regions to an Advisory Board of Directors.  The chairman of
which holds a seat on the regular board of directors of IPECS
Inc..  This insures that the entire membership will have a voice
in the future directions of the network.  To our knowledge, this
is the first time that this has been done in any, large scale
computer communications network.

The time is ripe for an organization such as this.  With the
proliferation of technology available to nearly everyone, a
computer network such as this can serve a great need.  We can
provide nearly instantaneous communications to crises areas
around the world.  Another important facet of the IPECS Network
is being able to provide moral support to crisis victims, as
well as making previous experiences and the knowledge gleaned
from these past experiences available to others.  We sincerely
hope that this "global knowledge" will help people from all over
the world deal with whatever situation they may find themselves
in, and promote understanding between diverse peoples of the
world.

In 1981, the percentage of schools in this country that had
personal computers available to students was 18.2%.  This number
has risen dramatically and in 1987 was up to 96.4%.  At the same
time, the number of students per PC has fallen from 56.2 in 1984
to 28.8 in 1987.  (1)

There has been an incredible increase of sales of PC's as well.
In 1981, 1.11 million PC's were sold.  These numbers increased
through 1984 to 7.61 million units.  After a slight drop in 1985
and 1986, 8.34 million units were sold in 1987.  (2)

Additionally, the use of modems in personal computers has
increased.  In 1981, 180,000 modems were in use in PC's in the
United States.  Through 1987, this number has increased to
nearly 9 million.

FidoNews 8-32                  Page 14                     12 Aug 1991


Clearly, there is a trend in this country.  People utilizing the
personal computer as a communications device.  Also, it is clear
that our children are getting "hands on" experience in the ways
of the computer world.  A computer network such as the
International Public Emergency Communications System Inc., is
timely.  "User friendliness", and IPECS' dedication to providing
crisis communications in an emergency situation, as well as "day
to day" communications that will keep the network "primed" and
ready for any situation, will be a benefit to people around the
world.

SaudiNet will continue as long as troops are stationed in the
Persian Gulf.  As long as there is a need for mail to the
troops, and it's much needed, the SaudiNet project will
continue.  Some may wonder where the Board of Directors of this
new corporation, the International Public Emergency
Communications System (IPECS Inc.) is going in the future.

By "corporation", we speak of the entire network.  The
individual node is the single, most important element of IPECS
Inc.  and SaudiNet.  Without the dedication of the individual
member, SaudiNet would have been an utter failure, and IPECS
Inc.  would have no future.

Now that we have the basic system in place, IPECS Inc.  will
continue to provide similar services during future crises,
wherever they may strike in the world.  We have proven, with
astounding success, that that we can function in accordance with
our charter in the worst of all possible scenarios, that being
wartime communications.  General H.  Norman Schwarzkopf
expressed interest in SaudiNet in a letter, February 27, 1991.


   INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM,
                        TOMMORROW
   -----------------------------------------------------

Our mission is not like other organizations whose basic
structure is the same.  We are not here to provide emergency
communications links between rescue and relief teams and their
offices in the United States.  Our mission is to provide an
invaluable communications link between the families, friends,
loved ones, and general supporters in this country and the
people who live and work in those foreign countries beset by
tragedy.  Be it war, as in the Gulf, or natural catastrophe such
as earthquake, fire, flood, or whatever may come along, IPECS
Inc.  will be there to provide timely, computer communications.

Our Board of Directors consists of selected members of our
current SaudiNet network.  We intend to include prestigious
members from corporate America, the Senate, and Congress as
well.  We have earned much in the way of credibility in the past
months or so, and we will continue to do so until it is
traditionally accepted of us.  We will be a respected and
credible organization whose services will be sought after by
humanitarian organizations and government agencies throughout
FidoNews 8-32                  Page 15                     12 Aug 1991


the world.  We have, in fact, already been approached.

We are expanding the existing IPECS network to include support
to the American and Canadian civilians who are rebuilding
Kuwait, and all the existing SaudiNet nodes who want to join us
will make up IPECS' general membership.  We will continue to
provide the valuable service we have been to date, honing our
skills, waiting and ready for the next crisis.  Our membership
will eventually total in the thousands.  From within the ranks
of our growing membership, we will recruit, and train, Crisis
Action Teams who will, on very short notice, pack up our
equipment and travel to the scene of a catastrophe to begin
establishing our essential links to that country.  We are
approaching various foundations and corporations for the funding
necessary to accomplish this humanitarian effort.

We will have our own computer and communications equipment,
including our own satellite communications link to transmit
IPECS members letters of support, concern and sharing of ideas
anywhere in the world.  We will have our own facilities to store
and repair this equipment.  We will have offices staffed with
full time employees from where we will conduct business just as
any successful charitable organization.

Our headquarters will have several data and voice 800 lines, as
will each of our regional coordinators in the field.  Our
operation will be entirely computerized, operating virtually
paperless in order to streamline efficiency, and the HQ will
house the IPECS BBS System which will be online 24 hours per
day, accessible through an 800 number, to provide membership and
outreach services to the general public in accordance with our
charter.

Between crises, our CAT members will "drill and train" in
preparation of the next call for our services.  Our
communications commitee will look at what was learned from
previous projects, and those mistakes that will inevitably be
made, planning for the next emergency utilizing this
information.  Our membership committee will actively seek out
new volunteer BBS sysops.  Our technical committee will work
with our existing member nodes, as well as new members as they
come online, to insure they have all the tools they need to
provide effective, efficient services to the general public
during the next emergency.  Our funding committee will actively
solicit contributions from a wide variety of foundations and
corporations.

Our Public Relations Director will continue to work with the
general public, as well as corporations, making our services
known to them through various publications and media events.
Our executive staff will continue to strengthen our contacts in
the world with applicable agencies and organizations so that we
may call on their expertise during future crises no matter when
or where they occur.
