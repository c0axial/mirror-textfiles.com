                          Announcing: SysNL v3.01

           "The fastest nodelist utility on the planet, period."

      Constellation Software, 1:250/714.0@FidoNet, 89:480/210.0@Imex

     With the FidoNet nodelist hitting almost half a meg, it is taking
     longer and longer  to  process  the  darn  thing.    Saving a few
     seconds here and there  is  all  you  used  get  if  you switched
     processors.  I'd like to present a viable alternative.

     To get you to switch  compilers,  you want something that makes a
     REAL  difference in your compilation time.    From  what  I  have
     heard, Scott Samet's XlaxNode is the fastest  around here.  Could
     I get you to switch to a compiler if it was FOUR TIMES AS FAST AS
     XLAXNODE?  Or maybe SIX times as fast as  ParseLst...?  TEN TIMES
     AS FAST AS XLATLIST?

     Then  I'd  like  to  introduce  you  to  SysNL  v3.01.   Nodelist
     processing in the modern age.

     SysNL  is optimised for speed.  A lot of frills have  been  taken
     out of the code.  It is small, and tight.  SysNL  uses  more  ASM
     code than any  other  compiler,  and  all the high-level language
     code in it has been written with speed in mind.

     SysNL can compile QuickBBS  and Version 5 nodelists from either a
     raw  St.    Louis  nodelist  file,  or  from  a  NodeList.Bbs/Fon
     combination.      SysNL  can  also  create    NodeList.Bbs    and
     Nodelist.Fon.  SysNL is also the most accurate Version 6 compiler
     around.  It is the only processor to support the most recent Opus
     v1.1x Version 6 ZMH flags.  ParseLst does not.

     SysNL v3.01 is also the only nodelist compiler that  supports the
     SEAdog<tm> v4.51  nodelist.    ParseLst  does not.  XlaxNode does
     not.  As  well,  SysNL will also compile the SEAdog<tm> v4.10 and
     TBBS v2.0 nodelists.  Faster than anything else.

     SysNL checks nodelist CRCs  faster  than  any  other  utility.  A
     16-bit CRC goes through at  the  rate  of 30-35K a second, faster
     than CRCnode or any other such utility you may have been using.

     SysNL merges nodelists and diff files.  Fast.  Automatically.  So
     you don't have to worry what about what your hub or NC sends you.
     SysNL finds the newest, and gets it done quickly.

     SysNL allows you to edit your nodelist.   If  you  are an NC or a
     Hub,  you can use its full-screen ANSI nodelist editor  to  mani-
     pulate your nodelist segment.  If you are an NC,  RC or ZC, SysNL
     can  easily  merge  all  the  updatres you get into one nodelist.
     Faster  than  MakeNL.    And MakeNL can't give you a visual ANSI-
     compatible  full-color   editor,  with  complete  nodelist  error

     checking.

     Right now, all  you  have gotten is hot air.  Let me provide some
     cold and rather sobering figures to back me up.  The figures are:
     The first is the time  and the second is processing rate in bytes
     per second.  All tests were  done  on a 6MhZ IBM AT, with 512K of
     150ns RAM, and a Rodine Type 20 30meg HD.  Times may vary, due to
     your hardware, and your setup.

         IMEXLIST.307 November 3rd, 1989 RCSA/AlterNet nodelist.
         Size of Imexlist.307: 45 892 bytes.

      Scan nodelist = Compile in wrong zone ie. Do not process any
                      entries.
        -#########- = Xlatlist<tm> cannot create a Version 6 list.

           Compiled into: NodeList.Bbs    Version 6    Scan nodelist

         ParseLst v1.30: 18.7 / 2454    14.2 / 3232    11.8 / 3889
            SysNL v3.01:  5.2 / 8825     6.1 / 7523     3.9 / 11767
         Xlatlist v2.90: 30.8 / 1490    -#########-    15.1 / 3039
         Xlaxnode v2.31: 14.5 / 3165    16.1 / 2851    11.9 / 3856

     Now, let's try it on something a little  bit bigger.  Errors will
     have been made in the timing of such a small 44K nodelist;  let's
     try a 480K one.

        NODELIST.237 August 25th, 1989 FidoNet nodelist.
        Size of Nodelist.237: 478 164 bytes.

      All compilers were configured as being in Zone 1.

         Compiled into: NodeList.Bbs    Version 6   Scan nodelist

        ParseLst v1.30: 187.9 / 2545  131.1 / 3647  111.7 / 4191
           SysNL v2.65:  81.8 / 5846   83.3 / 5740   48.1 / 9941
           SysNL v3.01:  33.8 / 14147  35.0 / 13662  13.8 / 34650
        Xlatlist v2.90: 325.2 / 1470  -##########-  110.6 / 4323
        Xlaxnode v2.31: 115.8 / 4129  129.8 / 3684  102.2 / 4679

     As  you  can  see,  SysNL  v3.01 beats all challengers, including
     v2.65, and also Xlaxnode v2.31.  Now we move to the  area  of CRC
     checks.  Again we use our FidoNet nodelist #237, and combat SysNL
     against CRCnode.

          SysNL v3.01:   21.1 sec / 22662 bytes per sec
        CRCnode v1.00:   27.8 sec / 17200 bytes per sec

     Again, SysNL  reigns supreme.  But SysNL can also make Version 5,
     Version 6, and QuickBBS nodelists from a Nodelist.Bbs/Fon combin-
     ation.  Let's sic  SysNL  on  OpusNode  and  Qnode  and  see what
     happens.

      Size of NodeList.Bbs (NodeList.237/SysNL v3.01): 254 572 bytes.

         SysNL v3.01 (QBBS):  21.2 / 12008
         SysNL v3.01 (Ver5):  20.1 / 12665
                Qnode v2.00: 125.7 / 2025
            OpusNode v1.4.6:  75.4 / 3376

     No matter what your nodelist  processor is, SysNL is faster.  Why
     not switch to it right now?   It's available on the SDS, and also
     at 1:250/714 as SYSNL.  An SFX  version is also available here as
     SYSNLSFX.

     I couldn't think of a sensible title for what is, I hope, going
     to be a regular contribution from Zone 2. Not that I represent
     Zone 2 on any way. My BBS is a node. In the words of technical
     standards documentation - the lowest form of address.

     My node came into the network a few weeks ago after a pause of
     almost a year not being involved with BBS's at all. So the first
     job was to download this years' back issues of FidoNews from my
     Host.

     Much to my shock I read a few articles from people explaining
     that FidoNews was no longer relevant anymore. According to these
     self-proclaimed guardians of access to exclusive information, the
     REAL NEWS comes in Echomail.

     At best Echomail is a genuine advance in communication. At its
     worst Echomail encourages the unthinking response of simply
     hitting 'R' on the keyboard to reply to the last 'flame'.

     Echomail also has a tendency to be a temporary medium. How many
     SysOps really read the megabytes of information floating around
     the net. We are hopefully more selective than that. We take some
     Echos for our users, some for our specialised interests and some
     to keep up to date with our particular concerns in the net.

     Rarely does a SysOp take every Echo.

     Echomail focuses widely on the particular as if to satisify a
     demand to discuss more and more about less and less. Thus, like
     Sheep, we are led into ever increasing arguement without really
     addressing major issues.

     However I am not here to throw my hands up and condem Echomail
     for destroying the moral fibre of arguement. It is my purpose to
     emphasise that by its very nature Echomail has a tendency to the
     specific, addressing the problem immediately, limiting itself to
     short responses, and within the week disappears into a deleted
     file on many a hard disk.

     Yet for this temporary medium we employ 'backbones', 'hubs', and
     'co-ordinators'. We spend hours on discussion and Echomail itself
     generates a political hierachy of distribution, rules and costs.

     FidoNews 6-50                Page 5                   11 Dec 1989


     The volume of Echomail causes as many worrys as it attempts to
     solve. We become obsessed with how long Echomail should be held
     before it's deleted, do we censor Echomail, and can Hosts afford
     to buy a 100 megabyte hard disk to cope with Echomail traffic.

     Amongst all this the balance of the network itself appears to
     have gone. I feel very strongly that the case needs to be put for
     FidoNews to bring people back together.

     FidoNews should be the place where we abandon the temporary,
     write for a larger audience, and make sure every SysOp can read
     FidoNews. It is my view, in my small backwater of Zone 2, that my
     Host should concentrate his efforts on getting me FidoNews at the
     expense of Echomail. Doing this in every net would restore much
     of the balance to the network as a whole and produce a higher
     level of debate about the issues facing us all.

     PC-Browse
     ---------

     On a totally different topic I have just bought a really neat
     little program from Quicksoft called PC-Browse. In essence it's a
     lot like the LIST utility which allows you to view files. However
     it also has the added advantage that it can be made memory
     resident.

     So I can read this weeks' FidoNews with PC-Browse and, if I need
     to, flip into a word processing session at the touch of a hot-
     key. The overall result is a pleasant use of the 60K of memory
     needed to run the program.

     However it does much more than this. You can create PC-Browse
     applications in a hyper-text environment. You can mark entries
     for quick access, even run a program from inside PC-Browse. The
     capability to cut and paste makes it ideal for calling up mames
     and addresses from inside other applications. All in all a very
     good buy.

     The program is marketed as Shareware in the USA, New Zealand, and
     Australia. For reasons of their own Quicksoft have excluded the
     UK as a Shareware zone.
