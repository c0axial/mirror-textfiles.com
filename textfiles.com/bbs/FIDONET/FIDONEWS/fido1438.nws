     FidoNews has its own domain name on the Internet NOW! Go to:

        http://www.fidonews.org

     and check it out!

     The Masthead and Internet sections have been adjusted to reflect the
     new URL. See the article below for more info on this upgrade to the
     FidoNews accessibility around the world.

     Speaking of the Nodelist, here in Zone 1 we haven't seen a Zone 2
     update since 197. What is going on there? Zone 2 still exists, right?
     Could there be another, better reason to get off the dime and get an
     International Coordinator? [sigh]

     The Autumnal Equinox is here. Don't forget to balance that egg on its
     end. You'll find that as easy as getting certain answers in FidoNet.

     Thanks to the untiring efforts of jim barchuk of 1:141/355, FidoNews
     now joins the domain realm of the Internet as the new site comes
     online at:

          http://www.fidonews.org

     on a dedicated machine that replaces the old geocities.com listing
     for FidoNews in HTML.

     The new site will contain the latest Issues as well as readable
     archives of all the old Issues. It will also have an online article
     submission engine and eventually search capability and any other
     features jim can think up. [grin]

     It also provides YAEA [yet another email address] for the Editor at:

          cbaker84@fidonews.org

     as well as jim's new address of:

          jb@fidonews.org

     as site manager and domain guru.

     The new domain name was fully approved by Tom Jennings [tomj@wps.com]
     and will be fully transferable to future Editors and site managers as
     necessary.

     Although some in FidoNet decry the "Internetzation"[tm] of our amateur
     network, the reality is that FidoNet IS part of the Internet and CAN
     and DOES benefit by the links it maintains there directly and
     indirectly. Internet access is the only long-distance support some
     FidoNet Sysops can afford in order to provide their Users the best of
     the material [Nodelists, FidoNews, software, etc.] available within
     FidoNet. The short-sighted see the Internet as competition for their
     dwindling userbase. The rest of us see the Internet as an evolutionary
     step to greater accessibility. Instead of boohooing, start exploiting.

     The new site is not completed, yet, but it has all the basics in place
     and is ready for your perusal. You should also leave email to jim as
     you pass with any suggestions or ideas you think will improve the
     service there. A Guestbook and a FidoNet Webring link will also be
     added soon.

     My personal thanks to jim for this purely volunteer effort seem meager
     compared to his work on this project, but nevertheless, "THANKS, jim!"

     I hope all of you with Internet access will go take a look at
     FidoNet's latest improvement at www.fidonews.org and while you're at
     it, go to the FidoNet Webring page and put YOUR FidoNet-related web
     info into circulation at:

           About This Alert
     _________________________________________________________________
     STOP THE GOVERNMENT FROM BUILDING BIG BROTHER INTO THE INTERNET

     In 1948, George Orwell described a future world in which Big Brother
     FIDONEWS 14-38               Page 4                   22 Sep 1997


     peaked over the shoulder of every citizen -- watching every move and
     listening to every word.

     Now, in 1997, the FBI is pushing the United States Congress to pass
     legislation which would make George Orwell's frightening vision a
     reality.

     Next week the House Commerce Committee will meet to consider a
     proposal that would require all Americans to provide the government
     guaranteed access to their private online communications and business
     transactions.  Taking a page out of Orwell's 1984, the FBI-spawned
     proposal would require that every part of the Internet -- from the
     software on your computer to the network provider that carries your
     messages around the net -- be jury-rigged to divulge your private
     conversations immediately on request by the FBI (see below).

     Unfortunately, this is not a work of fiction.

     The amendment, to be offered by Representatives Mike Oxley (R-OH) and
     Thomas Manton (D-NY), is a serious threat to your privacy and
     represents the first and final step in the construction of a National
     Surveillance Infrastructure.

     A vote is expected on September 25.  The future of privacy and
     security in the information age is in the hands of the Commerce
     Committee, and they need to know that folks are watching and care
     about the outcome.

     On Monday September 22, please join thousands of Internet users all
     across the country as we call on Congress to stop big brother.  With
     your help and support,  we can ensure that George Orwell's 1984 does
     not become a reality.

     All the information you need is attached below.

     _________________________________________________________________
     WHAT YOU CAN DO

     1. ON MONDAY SEPTEMBER 22, pick up the phone and call as many of the
        four leading members of the Commerce committee as you can:

          Chairman Thomas Bliley (R-VA)         (202) 225-2815
          Ranking member John Dingell (D-MI)   (202) 225-4071
          Rep. Tauzin (R-LA)                    (202) 225-4031
          Rep. Markey (D-MA)                    (202) 225-2836

     2. Ask for the staffer that handles the encryption issue.

     3. Say that you're calling to urge the Congressman to pass SAFE
        (HR695) without amendments.

        Specifically, say that you "OPPOSE THE OXLEY/MANTON BIG BROTHER
        AMENDMENT.  Americans should not be required to give the government
        keys to the front door of their house, and they shouldn't be
        required to give the government the keys to unlock their private
        online communications."
     FIDONEWS 14-38               Page 5                   22 Sep 1997


     Other amendments may be proposed.  Please urge the Congressman to pass
     SAFE "as is" and oppose any amendments. Feel free to use your own
     words though here are some points you might want to stress:

     - Oxley/Manton is a dramatic expansion of law enforcement power.  It
        would give law enforcement "immediate" access to private online
        communications and business transactions without any notice or
        knowledge to the user.

     - Oxley/Manton is NOT A BALANCE BETWEEN PRIVACY INTERESTS AND LAW
        ENFORCEMENT CONCERNS, as some supporters have argued.  It gives the
        FBI broad new power while stripping Americans of their Fourth
        Amendment right to be secure from unreasonable searches and
        seizures.

     - Oxley/Manton would give the Attorney General authority to dictate
        the design of Internet services and software to suit the needs of
        law enforcement.

     - Oxley/Manton would not stop crime. Strong encryption without
        "immediate access" features is available today at home and abroad.

     - Oxley/Manton would increase opportunities for cybercrime as criminal
        hackers attack vulnerabilities in the key recovery access system.

     4. Let us know how it went!  Go to one of the following web pages,
        depending on who you called, and tell us about the conversation.

        Rep. Bliley     http://www.crypto.com/member/meet.cgi?membid=va07
        Rep. Dingell    http://www.crypto.com/member/meet.cgi?membid=mi16
        Rep. Tauzin     http://www.crypto.com/member/meet.cgi?membid=la03
        Rep. Markey     http://www.crypto.com/member/meet.cgi?membid=ma07

     5. Forward this ALERT to your friends and colleagues.

     6. Feel good about yourself!  Know that you've stood up for privacy,
        and contacting Congress is more than most people take the time to
        do!

     BACKGROUND

     The House Commerce Committee is considering a bill known as the
     "Security and Freedom through Encryption Act" (HR 695, a.k.a. SAFE).
     SAFE would encourage the widespread availability of strong, easy-to-
     use encryption technologies in order to protect privacy and promote
     electronic commerce on the Internet.  SAFE enjoys broad support from
     Internet users, civil liberties advocates, and over 250 members of
     Congress.

     Last week, the Commerce Committee delayed its vote on the SAFE bill in
     order to give the Committee more time to study the implications of the
     Oxley/Manton amendment, which would change SAFE to ban encryption
     which does not contain features that provide law enforcement with
     "immediate access" to the plain text of encrypted information,
     including private communications and business transactions (visit
     FIDONEWS 14-38               Page 6                   22 Sep 1997


     http://www.crypto.com/safe_bill/)

     The Oxley/Manton amendment would for the first time impose sweeping
     restrictions on the ability of American citizens to protect their
     privacy on US soil. Specifically, the amendment would:

     * PROHIBIT THE DOMESTIC MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF ENCRYPTION PRODUCTS OR
       SERVICES WHICH DO NOT PROVIDE INSTANT ACCESS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT:
       The proposal would prohibit the manufacture, sale, import, or
       distribution within the United States of any encryption product
       unless it allows "immediate access" to the plain text of any user's
       messages or files without the user's knowledge.

     * GRANT BROAD NEW AUTHORITY FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO SET TECHNICAL
       STANDARDS FOR ENCRYPTION PRODUCTS: The proposal allows the Attorney
       General to set standards for what are and are not acceptable
       encryption products. The proposal's requirement of immediate access
       to plain text would seem to seriously limit the options available to
       encryption manufacturers seeking approval of their products.

     The amendment does not specify whether the immediate access "features"
     could be activated (or not) at the option of the purchaser or end
     user.  Nonetheless,  requiring that such a capability be installed in
     all domestic communications networks and encryption products is the
     equivalent of enabling a national surveillance infrastructure and
     asserts unprecedented control over the design of Internet software,
     hardware, and services.

     The amendment is analogous to the government requiring surveillance
     cameras in every new house built in the United States, which could be
     turned on remotely by the police if you were ever suspected of
     committing a crime.

     Worse yet, such "key escrow" or "key recovery" technologies pose
     significant risk to the security of the Internet -- providing new
     points of vulnerability for hackers, terrorists, and industrial spies
     to exploit.  A recent study by 11 of the worlds leading cryptographers
     concluded that the large scale deployment of such technologies would
     be too complex and too insecure to meet the needs of an Information
     Age society (see http://www.crypto.com/key_study/)

     Despite widespread opposition from Internet users, civil liberties
     groups, privacy advocates, and the computer and communications
     industries, Oxley and Manton plan to push for this FBI spawned
     amendment at the Commerce Committee vote.  If it is adopted, it would
     represent the first and final step in the development of a national
     surveillance infrastructure.
