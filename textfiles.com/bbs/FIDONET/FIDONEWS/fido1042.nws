========================================================================
   I am relieved. After lamenting the lack of complaints about
the misnaming of the news two weeks ago, we received lots of
complaints almost as soon as last week's issue was out the door.
Well, maybe we should retract that.  We received lots of
letters. They were all quite nice, and a few were even
complimentary. Thank goodness, somebody *does* read this.

   There are a lot of letters that come in here that never see
print. Not that we decide not to print them, but because they
are letters to us about some issue or other, and they were not
composed as articles. A short series of such letters is
included as an article today(FNEWS editorial). You may find
it interesting.

   Those other letters, though, take up quite a bit of time.
They include requests for information, mostly. How do I join
Fidonet? How can I get in touch with a board in South Africa?
Who is in charge of Fidonet? <uproarous laughter emitting from
terminal three>.

   We have been thinking, lately, of putting together a series
of short letters that could be sent back to these requests.
Maybe those should be available for Freq. Maybe someone has
already done it all, and *we* can Freq it. Comments would be
appreciated.

   On to the news.

The Electronic Gay Community Magazine
By Rex Rivers

It is ironic that recent issues of the FidoNews contain banter about
both electronic publications and gay issues, often with both subjects
in the same issue.  It so happens that an online publication on gay
issues has been available for about five years now.

Since 1988 the Electronic Gay Community Magazine has distributed news
of interest to gay men and lesbian women all over via computer.  The
primary goal of the publication is to share news important to the gay
community that the regular media ignores.

The magazine is divided into nine major sections plus special areas
for other electronic functions as demonstrated by the following menu
taken from the publication:

Setting up the magazine on a computer BBS is as simple as creating a
menu where the display of each file in the magazine is an option on
that menu.  The files are archived into .ZIP or .ARC format and are
available for file request at all times.  To update the magazine
simply request the latest archive and overlaying the "old" magazine
files with the "new" files from the archive.  With a simple batch file
the entire process can be totally automated.

Unlike most other electronic publications, there is no charge to pick
up the Electronic Gay Community Magazine and make it available to
users.  The only cost incurred would be the long-distance charges to
the telephone company when requesting the file.

For MS-DOS users the magazine archive contains a small program which
will display each section of the publication a screenfull at a time.
Those who don't have a computer can get the publication delivered to
them by fax for a small fee.

Those interested in the Electronic Gay Community Magazine may request
the file by polling for the GCM.ZIP or GCM.ARC archive from Fido node
1:291/9 at 316-269-3172.  The magazine may also be downloaded from the
Land of Awes BBS in Wichita, Kansas at 316-269-4208 by those who do
not have a mailer program.

FNEWS editorial
From: Rob Butler  (1:124/3109)

Hello Sylvia!

   I have to argue with you about the editorial you posted in the
latest FNews, primarily in response to my article.

   First, you state that children who are too young to read, won't.
Unless that child is learning disabled, or does not have the
advantage of a good education, they should have learned to read
without difficulty by the time they were eight. If you can find me
more than one child in 1000 that is not at least midly interested in
sex by the time they are 12, I would be dumbfounded - and they would
be able to read about it then also.

   Do you keep copies of Playboy, Penthouse, Playgirl lying around on
the living room table?  Probably not.  Why?  Because *you* are
censoring the material you and they read. I assume your children are
rather astounded right now, since "it astounds me that someone can
think they will develope a balanced, informed opinion by having their
reading material censored by anyone other than thenselves." It is
also socially and legally unacceptable for minors to have access to
such material, and I doubt you would have many neighbors coming to
visit.

   As far as "the last article in this issue makes some very
interesting points regarding legality", I made the same exact points,
and went into greater detail. I think you just stopped reading mine,
because you were so offended that I would question your parental
skills.

   Also, I fail to see one remark regarding Justin Shirk's obviously
prejudiced comments regarding homosexuals. I find it amazing that
you would totally let comments such as "it's allright to CHOOSE your
sexual nature?" and "instead of wasting out time on gay rights those
first few months" slip by. I find it incredulous that if you agree
with those statements, that you would have taken over the editing of
this newsletter from Tom Jennings, an openly gay person, unless it
was to allow just such comments passage. Even if you disagree with
them, I still am disappointed that you did not mention so, and it
greatly lowers my opinion of you and the other editors.

   Oh, and I've already received six netmail messages so far today,
congradulating me on my "wonderful" and "great" article.

later....

From: Sylvia Maxwell (1:221/192)

   Hello. i would have written sooner, but i had to take time to think
about what you said and how to respond:

 RB> prejudiced comments regarding homosexuals. I find it
 RB> amazing that you would totally let comments such as
 RB> "it's allright to CHOOSE your sexual nature?" and
 RB> "instead of wasting out time on gay rights those first

   i do not comment on everything printed in the snooze, and do NOT
censor anything at all according to any moral view, other than my
belief in free speech.  My personal understanding of my editorial
role, is that i am to somehow manage a forum in which members of
Fidonet can make statements about net-relevent topics.

   I *do* have opinions which i occasionally state, and so do other
editors, and all of the writers. No-one has to agree with whatever
they think i am trying to say, no-one has to agree with what anyone
else writes. I would appreciate your permission to print your letter
in the next issue of the Snooze.

 RB> same exact points, and went into greater detail. I
 RB> think you just stopped reading mine, because you were
 RB> so offended that I would question your parental skills.

   i did read your article, and your letter very carefully. I read your
article again, and the relevent articles, upon receiving your letter.
I try not to have my brain power limited by my own ego, because it
seems to me that narrowness and inability to see many sides of an
issue commonly cause much suffering.

   I have one response to Mr. Budda's statement that "...when the
contents of an echo are of such a character that they are more
suitable for distribution on a network that is "adult" (if you know
what i mean!)...".

   My response is, "no, i don't know what you mean." I never know what
loaded statements mean, they are open to misinterpretation and they
can be used to justify unstated prejeudices [i'm not assuming that in
Mr. Budda's case they *were*, but how can i know? It does strike me
oddly that he chose such wording].

   It seems to me that it *is* a valid concern to worry about legal
repercussions  for carrying echos.  However, i would carefully
scrutinize laws which attempt to mould media, before i would mould
the media to accommodate laws.

thank you for your interest in the Snooze,
s.max.

Al Filandro 1:141/885, 1:141/1885@Fidonet,
Cygnusrush@Aol.com
Rush-Fan Echo

The Rush Fan echo is looking for a few more participants to get things
flowing again.  This echo concentrates solely on the rock-band RUSH--
its music, philosophy and popularity in the online world.  The echo
is currently being seen by approximately twenty BBS's in Fidonet and
we hope you would consider joining in on the action.

With the new album Counterparts out, there should be reason for some
great conversation in this echo!! Wherever I go in the online world
I find RUSH FANS!!  Hook up today and lets bring this thing to the
backbone!

All I ask is that you poll my system once every week or two to pick
up the mail packets in the echo on hold for you.  To get started and
to join others in the online community interested in RUSH, contact
me netmail at 1:141/885 or 1:141/1885 or on my system, Cygnus X-I,
located in Southington, CT (203-628-9702 or 203-620-0757).

Warning: THIS IS NOT A RUSH LIMBAUGH ECHO <R_LIMBAUGH>

Applications of Public Key Cryptography

by Mike Riddle
   1:285/27

            Applications of Public Key Cryptography

Public Key Cryptography, as implemented in the three most popular
systems, Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM),
and Riordan's Privacy Enhanced Mail (RIPEM), takes advantage of the
"two-key" concept pioneered by Diffie and implemented by Rivest,
Shamir and Adelman in the "RSA" system.

In public key cryptography, each person has two "keys": one public
and one private.  The private key is just what it says: private,
known only to its holder.  The public key is freely and widely
distributed to anyone and everyone who might possibly want to
exchange private mail with the person who generated the public key.

FidoNews 10-42                 Page:  7                    17 Oct 1993

Public key cryptography became important to everyday people with the
advent of electronic mail.  If we think of everyday mail, we see
letters and postcards.  Letters have some degree of privacy due to
the envelope they are mailed in.  Some envelopes are better than
others at keeping the mail private, but all will do the job to some
extent. Contrast that with postcards, where anyone who handles the
mail can read it.

In electronic mail, each message has traditionally been like a
postcard.  Anyone who handled the message could read it.  Not
everyone would, of course, but for some people and some messages
the mere possibility that an unintended person could read your mail
is to be avoided.  Public key cryptography and electronic mail were
a marriage made in digital heaven.

Of the three common systems listed above, PEM is limited to the
online internet as it depends on a central "key server" for public
key distribution; therefore, the rest of this discussion will focus
on PGP and RIPEM.

Both PGP and RIPEM have freely distributable (at least within the
United States and Canada) source code, and executables have been
compiled for a wide range of platforms including the Mac, Amiga,
and IBM-compatible personal computer.

One can process a message with public key cryptography and get one
of three outputs: encrypted text, armored-signed messages, and
clear-signed messages.

1. Clear-Signed Messages.  These are messages processed such that
the text is not modified except for the addition of deliminator
lines and a signature block.  The signature block contains digital
information providing for the verification that the text contained
within the deliminator lines has not been altered, and information
identifying the person who signed the message.  The text can
easily be read by anyone.  Verification that the message is intact
as signed, and who originated it can be done by anyone using the
proper program and a copy of the originator's public key.

2.  Armored-signed messages.    These are processed the same as an
clear-signed message, except an "armor" is added.  This make the
message harder to corrupt in transport, such as frequently happens
due to varying end-of-line definitions, but has the detriment that
no one can read the message without processing it through the
encryption program.  The "armor" is a process, similar to
uuencoding, that will make readily apparent if the message has been
tampered with.  It is not essential to the digital signature, but
makes the transport more "robust".  Like the clear-signed message,
since only the originator has the originator's private key, whoever
reads it, be it one or a thousand, knows that only the originator
could have sent it.

3.  Encrypted messages.  These are encrypted by the originator
using the *recipient's public key*.  Remember that by design, the
public key has been widely distributed so anyone can use it.  Due
FidoNews 10-42                 Page:  8                    17 Oct 1993

to the nature of public key cryptography, only the intended
recipient can read this message.

The following examples illustrate the public key encryption
using PGP, using my public key:

A Proposal for Echo Pol to Include Clear-Signed Messages
by Mike Riddle
   1:285/27

      A Proposal for Echo Pol to Include Clear-Signed Messages

Current Fidonet policy as expressed in Policy 4.07, which predates
widespread availability of public-key programs, provides that:

     2.1.4  Encryption and Review of Mail

     FidoNet is an amateur system.  Our technology is such that the
     privacy of messages cannot be guaranteed.  As a sysop, you
     have the right to review traffic flowing through your system,
     if for no other reason than to ensure that the system is not
     being used for illegal or commercial purposes. Encryption
     obviously makes this review impossible.  Therefore, encrypted
     and/or commercial traffic that is routed without the express
     permission of all the links in the delivery system constitutes
     annoying behavior.  See section 1.3.6 for a definition of
     commercial traffic.

Note the concern is that sysops who desire to do so must be able
to review the content of mail passing through their system.

In the United States the privacy of electronic mail is statutorily
defined in the Electronic Communication Privacy Act of 1986, as
amended.  There is no case law that I am aware of interpreting
the ECPA to say exactly how much review by sysops is allowed and
how much is prohibited.  The language of the act is somewhat
ambiguous, but let us accept for this discussion that the ECPA
allows sysops to monitor and review traffic passing though their
system.

You can easily see that traditional encrypted traffic cannot be
read by the sysop.  If you read the earlier discussion of
Applications of Public Key Cryptography, you can also see that
clear-signed messages are readily readable by any sysop.  With the
proper "tools," just as with UUencoded messages, any sysop can
verify that the signature block is in fact a signature block.

To this date, illegal and defamatory messages have not been a major
problem in echomail.  One particularly serious concern, however,
has been that it is difficult to prove who entered a questionable
FidoNews 10-42                 Page: 12                    17 Oct 1993

message.  This is an extension of the general problem that it has
always been difficult to be certain who entered any message to
anybody.  The network has adopted a number of measures to reduce
the likelihood of such "spoofing," including password-protected
sessions, password protected packets, and secure-inbounds.  Such
measures have had some, but limited, success.

With the history and application of public key cryptography in
mind, and considering the purpose of sysop review supported by
Policy 4.07 para 2.1.4, I propose that Echo Policy 3.1 be changed
to read as follows:  I have included the entire section on
encryption so my proposal may be considered in context.

        4.2  Encryption

        The language of FidoNet is English, and all Backbone
     echomail traffic shall be in this language unless the echo
     moderator specifies otherwise.

        Uuencoded or similar message-format files are considered
     to be routed files and may not be routed in netmail.  With the
     exceptions listed below, no Backbone echomail or Echomail
     Routed Netmail message may be encoded, encrypted, public-key
     encrypted, enciphered or otherwise rendered unreadable.  The
     use of high or low ASCII characters is not permitted in the
     header, tearline, or origin line of a message.

        Short pieces of programming code, no longer than a typical
     message and infrequently sent, may be routed in netmail.

        Provided that an echo moderator has so indicated in the
     International Echolist, a moderator may permit high or low
     ASCII characters in the body of the message, and also small
     segments of recognized programming language or of uuencoded
     text, but is subject to Backbone judgement as to when these
     segments become excessive.

        Clear-signed messages, verifiable by readily available
     programs such as Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) or Riordan's
     Privacy Enhanced Mail (RIPEM), are allowed in Echomail routed
     netmail.  Armored-signed messages are not allowed in Backbone
     routed netmail or echomail.

        Provided that an echo moderator has so indicated in the
     International Echolist, a moderator may require, permit, or
     forbid clear-signed digital signatures, verifiable by readily
     available programs such as Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) or
     Riordan's Privacy Enhanced Mail (RIPEM).

        A sysop has the right to require that the originator of any
     apparently encrypted or otherwise unreadable message being
     routed through his system provide him with satisfactory
     evidence that the message is neither commercial nor illegal
     in content.

FidoNews 10-42                 Page: 13                    17 Oct 1993

The changes allow for clear-signed messages in Backbone routed netmail,
and allow for clear-signed messages (only) in echomail.  The rationale
is that with either message a concerned sysop can review the content.
The last paragraph of the proposed wording (which I did not change from
that which Adrian Walker posted) should satisfy any sysop that has a
problem with running the message through a filter.  The process is
essentially similar to using a decompression program or a GIF viewer.

The proposed change does not allow for armored-signed messages via the
Backbone for the simple reason that I don't think a majority of the sysops
would support the proposal.  I support the SecureMail concept, but recognize
that the current state of the law does not give the kind of convincing,
unambigous answers that some sysops want.  While armored-signed messages
do not actually hide anything from anyone with the right software, at this
time didn't feel the argument would win.

If anyone wants to move that armored-signed messages be allowed in
backbone, I'll second the motion.

EFF to Defend Crypto Rights Legally
----------------------------------

Washington, D.C. -- The Electronic Frontier  Foundation  has  committed
itself  this  week  to  legal  defense  efforts  in response to what is
apparently a U.S. government campaign against the  use  and  export  of
cryptographic technology.

EFF's  response  to  the  anti-cryptography  campaign,  which  has been
directed initially against the "Pretty Good Privacy"  (PGP)  encryption
program written by Phil Zimmermann, is three-fold:

o  EFF  and EFF board members will immediately contribute funds to Phil
Zimmermann's current legal expenses as they  relate  to  constitutional
issues  and  will  encourage  others  to  make donations for this legal
effort.

o EFF will continue to vigorously investigate  the  facts  of  the  PGP
case,  and other cryptography-related cases that may arise, in order to
spotlight the constitutional issues raised by such cases.

o EFF is planning to launch  in  the  near  future  a  First  Amendment
campaign  aimed  both  at  raising  funds  to support legal work on the
constitutional  issues  raised  by  these  cases   and   at   educating
policymakers  and  the general public about need to reform our outmoded
export control laws.
FidoNews 10-42                 Page: 15                    17 Oct 1993


The basic facts of the PGP case is as follows:

The Customs Bureau has interviewed Phil Zimmermann and others  involved
with  PGP.  A  San Jose grand jury subpoenaed documents relating to PGP
from ViaCrypt and Austin Code Works, two companies that intend to offer
commercial  products  related  to  PGP. The State Department has sent a
letter to Austin Code Works requiring  them  to  register  as  an  arms
dealer, even if they don't plan to export cryptography.

In  light  of  these  developments,  the Electronic Frontier Foundation
Board of Directors met in Austin on Sept 22-23 to plan EFF's response.

EFF's  Board  of  Directors  believes  that  this  case   may   involve
fundamental  issues  in  the  application  of  the U.S. Constitution to
digital media. At stake is the right to privacy, the  right  to  public
access  to  secure cryptography, the right to publish digital writings,
and the right to equal protection under the law.  We  are  resolved  to
take this matter very seriously.

For  this  reason,  EFF  will undertake a vigorous investigation of the
facts in this and any other PGP related cases which might arise.

If the Grand Jury issues indictments that would, in the  view  of  EFF,
threaten  the  future  of digital liberty, we are prepared to assist in
the case, and any other cases that might have similar adverse  effects.
We  are  also  prepared  to  seek  to  amend the export laws to protect
constitutional speech and the right to disseminate and  use  encryption
to  protect the citizens' right to privacy and to the security of their
communications.

In the short run, EFF will assist Phil and others involved with PGP  to
find  criminal defense attorneys, explore ways to get any cases handled
pro bono publico, or for expenses only, and contribute  funds  to  Phil
and   other   possible  defendants  for  pre-indictment  constitutional
research,  and  we  encourage  others  to  do  the  same.  As  of  this
announcement, several thousand dollars have been pledged by EFF and EFF
board members, including John Gilmore, Mitchell Kapor  and  John  Perry
Barlow.

In  the  near  future,  EFF will launch a national campaign designed to
provide legal and financial support for cases  or  legislative  efforts
that  would  promote the constitutionally guaranteed rights to develop,
discuss, and use cryptographic technology.

We urge you to help Phil Zimmermann  in  preparing  his  constitutional
defense  by contacting Phil's lawyer, Philip Dubois (dubois@csn.org, +1
303 444 3885,  or  2305  Broadway,  Boulder,  CO  80304,  USA).  He  is
accepting  legal  defense  contributions  relating  directly  to Phil's
defense as an individual.

Beginning this month, EFF welcomes three new additions to our staff.

Dan Brown will be EFF's new Systems Administrator.  Recently,  Dan  has
been  administering  the system and providing technical support at Case
Western in Cleveland, Ohio.  One of Dan's earliest  tasks  will  be  to
relocate  EFF's  cluster  of  SUN  Sparkstations from Cambridge, MA, to
Washington, DC.  Dan will then be  responsible  for  administering  our
gopher, wais and ftp sites. You can reach Dan at brown@eff.org.

Stanton  McCandlish  is starting as EFF's Online Activist.  Stanton may
be familiar to many of you already, as he  is  a  relatively  outspoken
member  of  several  popular mail lists.  Stanton has just moved all of
his belongings to DC from Albuquerque, New Mexico, where he ran his own
BBS.   One  of  Stanton's  earliest tasks will be to set up an EFF BBS.
Stanton will also be taking over editorial responsibility for  EFFector
Online.  You can reach Stanton at mech@eff.org.

Kathleen  Zaffina will be replacing Kirsten Erickson as EFF's Executive
Assistant.  Kathleen  has  over  15  years  of  experience  in  similar
positions,  most recently working at Amideast, a nonprofit organization
in DC that promotes understanding between people in the  United  States
and  Middle Eastern countries.  Kathleen will be responsible for making
sure that EFF's office runs smoothly, providing support  to  EFF  staff
and board.  You can reach Kathleen at kzaffina@eff.org.

New AREA CODES for the UK
John Bone (2:256/17)

SUBJECT... Message from British Telecom - NEW UK AREA CODES
THREE,
      TWO,
          ONE.
The Countdown to the new UK area codes has begun.....
(c) BT - British Telecom PLC 1993
81 Newgate Street, London, EC1A 7AJ
Offices in Europe, North America, Japan and Asia Pacific.

WHY THE UK AREA CODES ARE CHANGING:

On 16 April 1995, the number 1 will be inserted after the initial 0 in
the  UK  area  codes.  So,  for  example, the current UK area code for
Manchester 061 will become 0161.

These  changes  were  decided  by  OFTEL,  the  UK  telecommunications
industry  watchdog,  to  cope  with  the growing shortage of new phone
codes due to the expansion of the telecommunications industry.
FidoNews 10-42                 Page: 17                    17 Oct 1993


The new codes will create more capacity for numbers and new  services,
and enable us to satisfy your needs well into the future.  As a result
of the changes, there are significant implications  for  our  business
users,   whether   they   are   companies,   forms,  organisations  or
individuals. That's why we have produced this  leaflet.   It  explains
most things you need to know about the changes, and how to prepare for
them in advance.

WHY IT IS IMPORTANT TO START PREPARING NOW:

The main reason for letting you know about the new  codes  now  is  to
give  you  the  opportunity  to  prepare  well  in  advance - and keep
disruptions and costs to a minimum.

For example, you'll need to make changes to stationary and signs.

you'll  need  to  reprogram  any  computers   and   telecommunications
equipment  you  may  have  - such as switchboards, security alarms and
call barring systems ( switchboards with call barring will need to  be
adapted by Easter 1994 !).

The area code changes, however, will not affect: Freephone or reduced
rate  numbers, such as - 0800, 0345; premium rate (0900) numbers such
as 0981, 0839, 0881 and 0898; or UK mobile (celnet & vodaphone) phone
numbers.

TWO MORE CHANGES TO LOOK OUT FOR:

OFTEL  has  also  announced  changes to the area codes of five cities,
which have a particularly urgent need for more phone  numbers;  Leeds,
Sheffield,  Nottingham,  Leicester  and  Bristol.   These  cities will
therefore be given completely new codes.

The increase in number capacity will be achieved by adding a 2 or 9 in
front  of  the  local  city numbers. (ie. from six digit to sven digit
phone numbers.)

The new codes for each city are:
Leeds:      0523 nn nnnn    becomes   0113 2nn nnnn
Sheffield:  0742 nn nnnn    becomes   0114 2nn nnnn
Nottingham: 0602 nn nnnn    becomes   0115 9nn nnnn
Leicester:  0533 nn nnnn    becomes   0116 2nn nnnn
Bristol:    0272 nn nnnn    becomes   0117 9nn nnnn

AND on an international  level,  all  European  countries  are  moving
towards a single international access code.

So,  to harmonise with this, the international access code from the UK
will change from 010 to 00.

Once again these changes will take place on 16 april 1995.

HOW WE WILL BE HELPING YOU DURING THE COUNTDOWN TO PHoneDAY.

FidoNews 10-42                 Page: 18                    17 Oct 1993

Until April 1995, we'll be running a major publicity campaigh to  make
all BT customers aware of the code changes and what they need to do.

The  PHoneDAY  logo  you  see  here  in  this  leaflet  will  be  used
throughtout  the  campaign,  both   by   BT   and   all   other   (UK)
telecommunications companies.

From  March  throught to August 1994, our engineers will be setting up
and testing lines. So, in order to help  you  with  your  code  change
plans,  all  the  new  codes will be run in parallel with the old ones
after August 1994.

This will give you time  to  carry  out  necessary  changes,  such  as
amending  call barring equipment and reprogramming stored numbers into
telecommunications and computer equipment.

To make sure nothing is forgotten, we've inculded a checklist in  this
leaflet  which  details  the  changes that need to be made. We've also
included a questions and answers section that addresses queries  about
the  code  changes. If you have any further questions, simply call the
free helpline we've set up specially for phONEday. It gives  you  free
access  to  experts  who'll  be pleased to help you. The number is (UK
only) 0800 01 01 01.

YOUR phONEday QUESTIONS ANSWERED:

Q. Will everyone be affected by the changes?
A. Yes. Both BT customers in the UK and international  customers  will
be  affected, as well as customers of Mercury, Kingston Communications
in Hull, operators in the Isle of man, Jersey and Guernsey,  and  also
cable operators and most paging services.

Q. Will "MY" phone number stay the same?
A.  In  most cases, yes. but people calling you from outside your area
will have to add 1 to the existing dialing code. If you live is Leeds,
Sheffield,  Nottingham, Leicester or Bristol, however, you will have a
new code, and an extra digit will  be  added  to  the  front  of  your
existing number.

Q. Will call charges be affected by the changes?
A. No.

Q. What changes will I have to make?
A.  If  you  have  call  barring  equipment,  this  will  need  to  be
reprogrammed before Easter 1994. Switchboards and Security/fire alarms
that  dial  a pre-set number will also need to be reprogrammed. (Alarm
companies will be contacting their  customers,  so  you  may  wish  to
arrange a maintanence visit to coincide with the countdown to PHoneDAY.

Q.Will  BT  pay  for  the  changes I have to make to my stationary and
signage?
A.  No. We are letting all telephone users know the new UK codes early
to give them plenty of time to incorporate changes, such  as  amending
stationary and signs, as part of their normal replacement programme.

FidoNews 10-42                 Page: 19                    17 Oct 1993

Q. Will BT pay for the changes I have to make to my equipment?
A. No. In  most  cases,  BT  will  not  charge  for  modifications  to
equipment  which  is  covered  by  a BT mainanence contract. Any other
equipment should be modified as part of the manufacturers's service.

Q. Will all numbers change?
A. No. mobile phones will still use the same  codes;  Only  geographic
(UK)  area  codes  will  change.  0800  and  0345 numbers won't change
either. Nor will recorded message  phone  lines  (aka  0900  services)
begining with codes like 0891.

Q.  Why  couldn't these changes have been made at the same time as the
London code change?
A. London simply couldn't wait for an increase in  phone  numbers.  We
had to act by 1990 and OFTEL hadn't made a decision about the national
code change at that stage.

   Note. London numbers are again subject to the phONEday changes.
   For example: London  071 nnn nnnn becomes 0171 nnn nnnn
           and  London  081 nnn nnnn becomes 0181 nnn nnnn

Q. What will happen if my customers or clients dial my number  without
the extra 1 after 16 April 1995?
A. Their call will be answered with a pre-recorded message whick  will
remind  them  about  the  code  changes.  BT  will not charge for this
service.

Q. I'd still like to know more about how these changes will affect me.
Who should I call?
A. If there's anything else you'd like to know, just call our  special
helpline  on  (UK only) 0800 01 01 01. We'll be happy to help you, and
you won't be charged for the call.

V25bis MODEMS
Jose Luis Mazuela (2:341/18.106)

I've seen in several issues of Fidonews, discussions about
the compressor standard. You know, why arc method if we have
arj, zip, etc. And the principal point is the portability.
Ok, no problem, I understand there are systems that only has
in common this method whith others.
Then, why I say I was going to talk about v25bis modems and begin with
FidoNews 10-42                 Page: 21                    17 Oct 1993

this example? Simple, because is a good example, I think,
to make know the people, specially the frontend processor (fep)
programmers, about the problem that have the users of this type
of modems.
This modems need a special way to make it run well.
The commands are a little bit difference of Hayes but the
principal difference is the parameters of communication.
When you pass the commands (from DTE to DCE) it must be at 7e1
(7 even 1) and the another big one: the modem has the
CD circuit (109) high ever (without posibility of disabling).
So this is a big problem because the mailer think there
is real carrier and don't do anything.
So what I mean is, if a file as nodelist is in arc method
because 'universality' what about v25bis method, approved
by the CCITT?
Is no difficult to implement this option in a fep.
I think is just a few lines in a program that the programmer know
perfectly after several releases. There is many people that uses
this modem with progs such as telix, (win)terminal, etc. but not
with fep's.
So, that's my calling to fep programmers, I think is not very
difficult to make us happy. :)

Bye!

P.S. If anybody knows a Public Domain or Shareware program that
     contemplate v25bis mode please, tell me. Thanks.

YAAC (Yet Another Article About Censorship)

by Gleason Pace [Noah] @FidoNet#1:105/37

Censorship in Fido; ignoring the sewer won't  make  it  stop  running
through my yard.

I  am  writing in response to Steven Haslam's article in the previous
Snooze (and ones from others previous to that, even).  I can't  claim
to  have  a  five  minute  (day)  rule because I have never done this
before, so I guess I am free to sit right down  and  spout  off.   So
here goes.

Yes,  it's true that I can change the TV channel and not read certain
Fido echos, and this will prevent my tender eyes from viewing  things
I don't want to see.  But of course that is really not the problem is
it?

Your quote from Heinlien is to the point in a simplistic sort of way,
but we do not want to throw out laws just because some people persist
in trying to codify their own personal moral pecadillos (I  know  one
person's  pecadillo is another person's imperative).  We persist with
obnoxious and fundamentally inequitable legal systems because we have
learned  the hard way that we cannot trust each other and, so far, we
FidoNews 10-42                 Page: 22                    17 Oct 1993

have found no better way of defending ourselves.  And  also  because,
once some system like that gets started, it is abominably hard to get
it stopped.  Again, your quote from Robert Sommer misses the mark.  I
am constantly unable to go places I really don't want to go (Somalia,
Yugoslavia, the names are shift with world events); but I am  content
to not be able to go to these places.  And I am quite content to have
people tell me I can't do things that I  really  don't  want  to  do.
Getting upset about things like that is for people who have a need to
be upset about something.

The problem is that there are people in the world who  DO  *WANT*  to
see  the  things  that  TV has to offer, and read smutt on Fido, etc.
And the presence of these people affect the quality of life  for  the
rest of us. Among these people (remember, I said among) are those who
want to murder us, molest our children, rape us, rob us,  also  those
who  tend  to  object  to  intellectualism,  or  to values other than
material.

And ultimately the problem with feeding the wants of these people  is
that  it  carries the message that it is really OK to be the way they
are, instead of encouraging them to seek help and  change.   I  would
agree  that  it  is  really  not  our  problem to see to it that they
improve their own karma, but it is not in our interest  to  encourage
their behavior either.

Actually  the  problem  with  censorhip  is  the same problem we have
whenever we try to regulate ourselves.  We have noone but our  fallen
selves (in the religious sense) to do it.  And so we are always faced
with the problem of which abuse is worse: the abuse of our fellows or
the  abuse  of  our chosen leaders.  Sometimes it's one and sometimes
the other.

Hallo Sylvia, Donald, Tim!

"I am astonished.....Now I am wondering DOES ANYBODY READ THIS?"

As you might see - the answer is YES. I read this in Germany and  the
Fidonews are an important source of information for me.

Congratulations  that  you  published  several  (quite open) articles
about the "Putsch" in R24 - I wonder if anybody in FIDO really  takes
care   what  happens  here.  Any  feedback  from  US-nodes?  What  is
T.Jennings opinion?

This leads me to an often heard statement  from  german  sysops  that
Fidonews  is not an important platform of discussion because only few
sysops in fact read it! Is that true?

Thanks for the dedicated work you are doing and

If memory serves correctly...it's possible for the child to get
away with sort of thing because he/she is considered a minor..
where as we are not.  And basically, because they are "children"
they are considered to be "innocent" and we'd be along the lines
of pimps for supplying them with said material.  The BBS is a
prime place for the moving of this material isn't it?
Why, I can just see my computer hanging out on damp and musty
street corners oogling at all the little girls and boys and
leading them into a life of debauchery.  (Grin).

The fix is simple really...if you want to run a BBS with adult
areas...then restrict the areas to people you have personally
met and can verify are over age.
What, you say that you couldn't possibly do such a thing?
Too many people you say?  My goodness, I believe that social
activities such as BBS meets would be a wonderful forum for such
meetings to take place...after all, this is your hardware and a
few years of your life we're only speaking of here...

But I still think that retreating into corners and denying that
people have a sexual nature is repugnant at best...after all,
your mothers and fathers probably were not virgins when they had
you now didn't they?  Mom and Apple Pie is a little different
concept than Mom tied to the bedboard yelling at your Dad,
"Ride me like a wild bronco, you love muffin you!" >=)

FidoNews 10-42                 Page: 24                    17 Oct 1993

The point here is of course...your ancestors had sex lives
(probably..the ones who didn't didn't leave anyone behind to say
they didn't)..your grandparents had sex lives, and so did your
parents. And you probably do as well.
And Bill Clinton, Mr. John Majors, and numerous other people.
I don't particularly care to look into Tip O'Neil's bedroom and
see if he wears a tutu...
(which would be frightfully silly anyways)
...or Bill Clinton's...or yours.  Or anyone else's.  What they
choose to do in their bedrooms(kitchens, bathrooms, counter-tops)
is their own business, and none of mine.
And vice-versa if you please.  (Thanks, you're a peach)  >=)

Yes, but the last time that I'd heard...(it may have been some
form of auditory hallucination on my part of course)..was that
ignorance of the law is not an excuse.  Please forgive me if
I'm in error here.  It would seem to me (as a guess of course,
I am not a lawyer) that a Sysop would naturally be accountable
for all and any content on their BBS.  Otherwise, we'd be seeing
a lot more "smackie-handies", and a lot less impounding of
equipment going on, I'd think...

I'm going to turn the next little bit around here, and let you
read it from the other side of the coin..(please note kiddies,
I'm going to be doing word substitution in the next two
paragraphs, but at no time do my hands leave my wrists, or do
I change the sentences OTHER THAN the afore-mentioned single
word substitution)  This is simply for illustration of a point
that you might be missing here.  (Settle back with your popcorn
now...the show's about to begin).

Do you see the point here everyone?  You could substitute the
words "gay, lesbian, homosexual" for
"straight, hetero, heterosexual" and come out with an article
that would be saying that men and women should not be allowed
to practice sexual relationships across genders.
Scary when it's turned around like that isn't it?  (And to make a
point, I've also kept hearing theories on how a person's sexual
prefernce is usually hot-wired (pardon the accidental pun) into a
person at birth.  You don't learn to be gay or lesbian or even
heterosexual...it's something that's built-in.  And yes, I think
it IS alright to "choose" your sexual nature; you're the one that
has to live with yourself and your actions aren't you?  And
living how you feel the most at peace with yourself should be
your right as an individual.

If you want to live with a turnip farmer in Tuskerneeny and be
their love slave...that's your choice.  If you want to be
celibate...also your choice.  Spending your life with a woman
and devoting your life to God...again, your choice.  Living on
the back of a Harley with your arms wrapped around the waist of
"Sex Gargoyle"...once again, your choice.  It's your conscience,
and your own relationship with your particular Diety that should
your own guide.  (Because my beliefs may differ from yours...
there are many differing views when it comes to both sexuality
and religion).

Now, I am personally not gay or lesbian...(Yes, I have the
equipment for the first, but not the second)...but what I am
first and foremost is a Humanist.  Namely, I believe that gay
and lesbian peoples have just as much right to choose their own
lifestyle as heteros do. (thank you very much).  After all,
they're people...you're people...if you wanted to have sex with
a banana split (and that chocolate does make it tempting at
times...ooo, that whipped cream)...then I feel you have the right
to get yourself smothered in toppings.  But, only if the
banana split were consenting..I hasten to add.  And of legal age.

You're saying in your article that FidoNet is making itself
liable to search and seizure by carrying these echos...well, I
personally feel that that's Fido's decision to carry/not carry
them. And they probably have a lot more lawyers at their disposal
through the network than you and I do.  So, let it be Fido's
decision...not ours...whether to carry/drop them.  We just have
a say in whether or not we carry them personally.

I agree with you on health care...it's an important issue.  I
FidoNews 10-42                 Page: 26                    17 Oct 1993

also look at the amount of cash being pumped into defense
purposes and go..."Wait a minute...couldn't we use some money
from here to put into the health care system?
After all, the "Red Menace" doesn't exist anymore."
And frankly, I don't own a gun or any other weapons (other than
some really nasty chopsticks)...I believe that my own country
should take our wooden boats and forces and split them evenly
between the Coast Guard and the United Nations Peacekeeping
Forces.  It's been about 35-40 years since the Canadian military
was really considered to be much of threat to anyone really.
(In my opinion, anyways).  Guess I'm one of those dreaded
liberals that want gun control and even worse...
one world government.  Maybe with one group of people governing
everyone...we might be able to put away our toys and start
cleaning up our mess before someone gets an eye poked out...or
worse, starts playing with Daddy's gun.  I think that the money
necessary for health care could quite easily be found, housing
and job creation programs could start, and we could get the
homeless into homes again if we weren't so busy being paranoid
of our neighbours.  And what they do in their bedrooms.

And who they pray to.

Try treating that person like they were your brother or
sister...respect them as human beings...and don't worry about
what they do in the middle of the night.  You wouldn't want
someone peeking in your window with a movie camera filming you
in an intimate moment...and I'm sure that not too many of the
rest of us do either.

(Except possibly those with a voyeuristic streak)  >=)

Better yet, try treating everyone like you'd like to be treated...
I'm sure that we'd all be living in a happy world if everyone
treated everyone else as nicely as they treated themselves.
(Which reminds me Justin....I'd also made a small change in your
SIG to remove some of the blockiness of it for you...feel free
to use it if you wish.)  =)

And lastly...(finally)...I also make apologies for the length of
this article...200+ lines including Justin's quoted material.  I
know that I probably offended some people with my opinions as
well...but I guess that's one of the things that makes life so
rich and worth living.  The fact that we are all different, and
we all have our own opinion's on topics.  And while I may not
have the viewpoint of some...I hope that people have been able to
sense that I was writing from a humourous viewpoint (yes, that's
how we spell it up here in Canada.^ =) and that I treat sex and
religion both as something that we can love and laugh about.
Because when it comes right down to it...sex is pretty messy and
smelly anyways....and so are religious wars.  Hmmmm, there's a
thought...  (for another time.  ^  )
