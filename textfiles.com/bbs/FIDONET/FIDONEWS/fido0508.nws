     =================================================================
                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================

     Well, it  has been awhile since I graced these pages. While I had
     meant to  have  an  editorial  in  almost  every  issue, personal
     demands on  my time  have not allowed it until now. First off I'd
     like to thank all of you who have been sending in articles. I may
     not have  sent some  of you  any reply,  but your work is greatly
     appreciated. If I see any  sign  on  an  article  being submitted
     (usually at  least a  null message in my netmail area), I try and
     remember to send out  a thank  you message.  The only  problem is
     that I can't count on any such message these days. If you sent in
     an article and didn't  receive any  reply, my  apologies as  I do
     appreciate the fine articles I have been receiving.

     In  the  "good  ole  days"  all  we had to deal with was Fido and
     SEAdog. While many of us may reminisce about these times, I think
     we  all  appreciate  the  variety  that  has appeared in FidoNet.
     Thanks in  no  small  part  to  the  FidoNet  Technical Standards
     Committee, we now have a multitude of different software packages
     from which to choose. No longer do we  argue on  which version of
     Toss/ScanMail  to  use,  instead  we have at least four different
     packages to worry about. While  some  of  these  are  specific to
     bulletin  board  programs  that  do  not  use the FidoNet message
     structure, we must still keep in mind how any change  will affect
     all  users.  FidoNet  has  grown  up.  Anytime  a  new package is
     written, the author MUST keep in  mind how  it will  affect those
     not running  their program(s). No matter how far advanced network
     software becomes, there will  always be  those who  only run Fido
     version 11w.

     While this  may not  make much  sense to some of us. These people
     have gotten their software to work reliably and  are reluctant to
     change to  anything new  (to them).  There is  nothing wrong with
     this attitude, it is an old saw about  how when  something works-
     don't touch  it. Many  of us  have spent  a large number of hours
     trying to learn how these programs work (and don't work) and only
     now  are  achieving  any  degree  of reliability. While some will
     always choose to try the new,  there should  also be  a place for
     those who are content with what they have.

     Why  do  I  bring  this  up? Because FidoNet is based on RELIABLE
     communication between systems. While  many may  only be concerned
     about EchoMail, there is much more to FidoNet than EchoMail. This
     isn't to say that EchoMail isn't important these days, because it
     is.  EchoMail  may  be  one  of  the most important concepts ever
     introduced to FidoNet. But  EchoMail is  only a  part of FidoNet,
     and even it is based on reliable communication. While catching up
     on some EchoMail conferences this  past  weekend,  I  noticed how
     this idea seems to be fading. If it ever does vanish, we may very
     well see the end to FidoNet. After all, if I can no  longer count
     on my mail getting through, why bother sending it at all.

     Another  idea  that  seems  to  be  vanishing  is RESPONSIBILITY.
     FidoNet  is  not  a  right.  When  you  joined  FidoNet  you were
     FidoNews 5-08                Page 2                   22 Feb 1988


     accepting  the  responsibility  for  several things. Primarily to
     "not excessively annoy others," "not be easily annoyed," and most
     important of  all to make your node available only to other nodes
     during National Mail  Hour  (NMH).  While  NMH  may  be  a little
     outdated these days with so many running continuous mail programs
     like SEAdog and BinkleyTerm, it  is  still  important  to observe
     NMH. Many nodes are unable to process mail at anytime of the day,
     and can only send and receive mail at  specified times.  To these
     people, NMH  is the  only way  they can reliably send and receive
     mail. When the nodes  they're trying  to contact  are always busy
     due to  receiving a  large batch  EchoMail or  allowing users, it
     only serves to annoy others. In time, it could even be classed as
     excessively annoying.

     New software  could easily  cause the  net to come apart in days.
     The base FidoNet protocol  is very  important. Any  program meant
     for use  in FidoNet  NEEDS to  be able  to fall back and use this
     original. Without this, no one would ever know where it  was safe
     to  try  sending  mail.  While  this may be considered archaic by
     some,  it  is  the  basis  of  this  network.   Without  complete
     compatibility, we  are endangering something that many of us have
     worked hard to see continue.  I  ask  that  all  network software
     authors  keep  this  in  mind,  lest  they  become  known  as the
     destroyer of FidoNet just  because they  need the  ego trip  of a
     "title" like creator of whateverNet.

     This is getting depressing and I need to take a break. Let's hope
     the echo conferences leave me in a better  mood by  next week. In
     the meantime, feel free to contact me on any ideas you might have
     on an article. I'd be happy to help  out if  possible. If  you do
     send  an  article,  please  try  and make it match the submission
     guidelines  (which  can  be   file  requested   SEAdog  style  as
     ARTSPEC.DOC from  1:1/1). I'm  receiving an awful lot of articles
     that don't even come close and  it's  creating  an  awful  lot of
     work.  I'm  sure  you  want  your  submissions  to  be printed as
     quickly as possible, and if something doesn't match specs it will
     usually add another week to seeing it go out.

     COLLEGE - A new echo

     Michael Keyles
     1:107/320

     COLLEGE is for those people running or using an electronic bulletin
     board system at a high school, college or university. Hopefully we
     will cover such topics as: funding, getting new hardware/software,
     how to support users, helping non technical users with computing and
     running gateways to other networks.  Perhaps we can even share user
     documentation and ideas on providing new services, extending the user
     base, etc.

     If you have any ideas, or just want to get some information, please
     feel free to join in. If you know of other schools that run a BBS,
     please let them know about us!

     You can link in by sending me mail at 1:107/320. I will send to you
     if you are in a PC Pursuit city.

     EchoList: Past, Present, Future.

     I wrote this article in able to get the story straight regarding
     the sad shape the EchoList has deteriorated to! Along with some
     praise there have been many flames. I hope this article will
     explain it all.

     Many moons ago (April 1986) I became a Fido Sysop. Much thanks go
     to Gee Wong for alot of hand holding and assistance when I
     started up. I was a long time user of a couple of Fido BBS and
     thus I knew the terrain of FidoNet. I had read all the back
     issues of FidoNews before becoming a sysop so not much was new.
     Little did I know this was going to be the dawn of EchoMail!
     There were only a handful of conferences. The ones I recall were
     SYSOP, TECH and MAGICK. Believe it or not you could count the
     number of conferences on both hands! It didn't take long before
     conferences were springing up everywhere.

     The growth was so rapid that nobody knew how many nor what type
     of conferences existed. I wanted to know! So I took it upon
     myself to collect data about what conferences existed and share
     it with whomever was interested. In the summer of '86 I worked
     out a draft and I then begged for information but almost nothing
     came. I then put Plan B into action. If the data won't come to me
     well I'll have to go to the data! I spent many months collecting
     echomail conference information from any and every source.

     I published that first official list in Jan '87 and then EchoList
     became recognized as a place to list and find conferences. There
     were still other sources for echomail information, but EchoList
     was the only publication of its kind.

     Well Plan B worked but this fame had its price, now not only did
     I scan many echos collecting data to update the EchoList I was
     getting updates from moderators as well and even would be
     moderators. The burden was getting to heavy and delays started to
     occur. I asked for assistance and got some replies. I attempted
     to deligate some tasks to aid in automation but but I guess my
     selection of assistants was poor because after they would get the
     spcification of what I needed they would fade away. I was
     attempting to off load my work to others and it wasn't working.
     This additional fustration slowed me down even more.

     The flames stared rolling in about how out of date EchoList was
     so I got frantic and rushed to get an update done. I did it but
     it burned me out. This was the June '87 issue and I was about to
     throw in the towel and pull the plug on the PC for good. Yes the
     EchoList was bigger and better than previous versions but that
     also meant big and better flames as well :-) Then guess what
     happens... IFNA presents an award to me at the Aug '87 Fido
     convention. Well the recogniztion cheered me up a bit and I went
     back to the old habbits of applying updates from moderators and
     other sysops which wanted their net listed as well as scanning
     the echos for updates and everything else! Well I should have
     taken a fresh new direction but I didn't....

     FidoNews 5-08                Page 5                   22 Feb 1988


     I got a list published in Dec '87 but it didn't have time to
     apply all the updates. I thought some updates would be better
     than none. Well not everybody agreed :-( After this issue and one
     more failure in recruiting some help I saw it was time for me to
     get things done. I just had to automated this beast it's time was
     long overdue!

     I talked to a few sysops and kicked around a few ideas. I'm
     finally (sigh of relief) going to learn from my mistakes :-) In
     the past I wanted everthing listed. I don't know why, just call
     me crazy (and maybe a perfectionist?). I had some sort of idea
     (carried from the old days) that I had to collect the data
     because not everybody would send it to me. If I did get updates
     well that would be gravy. As Echomail Scribe I can't do it all,
     I'm only a human not a computer. What this means is rather than
     put all the responsibility at the top we need to push it down to
     the "moderators". What this means is that if the moderator really
     wants to support the conference they will need to send in an
     update at least once a month. If this is not done the conference
     will not be listed. This way I won't be banging my head against
     the wall doing all the work. You (the moderators) of course will
     get a share some of thoese flames :-)

     A deadline will be fixed at a later date for monthly updates.
     With this policy we will no longer have listings carried over
     from list to list. That means no outdated garbage! AMEN (the
     number one complaint). I am working on the specification for the
     format of an EchoList update message. That should appear shortly.
     I and a couple of sysops are currently working on the programs
     that will be used. Everything will be automatic! At this time I
     would like Echomail moderators who currently produce regional or
     net conference lists to contact me. We might as well share these
     utilities so we can all benifiet. I know the format of these
     reagional/net lists are different but I am certain we can work
     something out.

     Of course this new method is radical if not revolutionary but I
     think it's time has come. If the conference moderators can't take
     the time to send information well there is nothing I can do about
     it. If the topic is that important I'm certain somebody will be
     responsible enough to volunteer to be the moderator.

     All this brings us to a sticky point. What about all those
     conferences that don't have moderators? Well somebody will have
     to step forward or they won't be listed it is as simple as that.
     You may be wondering about how to get conferences which don't
     exist listed. I mean the "if anybody wants to start an echo about
     ABC contact me" listings... I must frankly say, I don't know what
     I'm going to do about that. They might be listed or there might
     be a seperate "wish list" produced. I have to think about this
     one and I welcome your comments.

     The future? Well I have many things I would like to see happen.
     For example one of the most frequently asked questions I get is
     where can I link into XYZ conference? Well I just refer them to
     the moderator. What I would like to see is a utility like
     FidoNews 5-08                Page 6                   22 Feb 1988


     megalist that can run online and assist in such queries, as well
     as topic searches. Maybe even a program that would be a server to
     do this via netmail! As well, I would like to draw maps of the
     topology for a conference and even compute routing delivery
     times. I realize there are many other things people would want
     and of course I can't do it all so I want to pulish a database
     version of the list which can be used by anybody's utilities.

     Well alot of water has passed under the bridge both good and bad.
     I hope this story has given you insight into the problems I've
     had. With this new vision I hope I can count on your assistance
     and support! It isn't going to be easy. I'm certain we'll have
     some growing pains, but in the end we will have something that
     serves the network as a whole. United we're echomail, devied
     we're just netmail. Keep an eye out for the EchoList update
     message format coming soon.

                  FidoNet: An experiment in COMMUNICATION
                  ----------------------------------------
                  by Steven K. Hoskin
                  ( STEVE HOSKIN at 1:128/11 )

     Introduction:

          The header on the FidoNet NewsLetter says to encourage users
     to submit to the NewsLetter; I am a user; this is an article.

          I'm planning on joining IFNA, though I'm not yet a member.
     I'll be putting up a part-time BBS presently; when I can afford
     another computer I'm going to dedicate it to the FidoNet as a
     full-time FidoNode.  I'm a computer programmer, both by trade and
     by hobby, and I'm familiar with the concept of the FOSSIL, though
     I'm not intimately familiar with using it...yet.

          I therefore consider my input to be of some minor value, but
     currently I feel its of value due to my status as an "outsider
     looking in" on the problems with FidoNet in its current
     situation.

          I speak of dissent.  I speak of flames.  I speak of
     attitudes.  I speak of AlterNet. I've been reading the IFNA Echo
     off a friend's board, and I don't like a lot of what I've read. I
     still read it, hoping to see the old FidoMood return ("...be
     reasonably polite...").  Occasionally it does, but mostly I see
     flames. While I commonly use the terms FidoNet, FidoNode,
     FidoList, FidoMood, FidoPolicy, FidoDoc, FidoLink, FidoManners
     and FidoSysOp, please note that I do not use the term FidoFlames;
     I consider them quite unbecoming to the intent of FidoNet.

          A lot of the flames have to do with AlterNet.  Why??  Oh,
     sure, they broke away from FidoNet, but the FidoNet Policy
     documents up to and including Policy3 have all said that's one
     of your options if you don't like what's happening here.

          You could raise the argument of split nets and problems
     therefrom, and all I will say is I agree.  Their breaking away
     from FidoNet now leaves two nets, whereas one controlling entity
     - the NodeList - kept the system manageable.  I don't like the
     FACT that they broke away from FidoNet, but I don't hold it
     against them.

          FidoNet is an experiment in COMMUNICATION.  Not
     EXCOMMUNICATION.  Not CENSORSHIP.  COMMUNICATION.  To quote
     somebody from the IFNA echo, "...communication is the name of the
     game...".  I couldn't agree more.  Look, AlterNet was quite
     clearly formed because a group of FidoNet SysOps were getting
     tired of the flaming out there on FidoNet.  I consider their
     reason a good one.  I personally think they should've kept in
     there, batting it out, working to make a better FidoNet; that's
     MY opinion and I AM entitled to it.  The SysOps of AlterNet are
     entitled to theirs also.

          Okay, so they broke away.  What do we do now?  IFNA Echo

     can tell you a lot about what COULD be done; there are thousands
     of possibilities.  The upcoming article is geared towards
     expressing MY opinion about which of the multitude of options
     really ought to be used.  If you wish to respond to my article,
     you can reach me as STEVE HOSKIN at 1:128/11 and I  W E L C O M E
     your responses.  Do not send me E-Mail on the IFNA Echo; I am not
     permitted to send mail on that Echo.  If you respondto me
     directly at the board I call "home", then you will probably get a
     direct response.  If you "flame" me, I suppose you are entitled
     to do so, but I feel this is in violation of the intent of
     FidoNet and may think the lesser of you. Besides, you probably
     won't get a reply.  If you politely state your views and politely
     express weaknesses in mine - I can almost guarantee you a
     response.  In my book, insults are about the weakest form of
     communication known to man. Insults are perhaps second only to
     assumptions and silence as being the strongest form of
     non-communication.

          Okay, the wordy stuff is out of the way, here comes the
     meat of this article -- MY opinion on what should be done about
     AlterNet.

                           AlterNet:  What to do?
                           ----------------------
                           by Steven K. Hoskin
                           ( STEVE HOSKIN at 1:128/11 )


               - In each human heart are a tiger, a pig, an ass, and a
               nightingale.  Diversity of character is due to their
               unequal activity.

                                             - Ambrose Bierce


          AlterNet has formed; SysOps have either left FidoNet or
     have gone dual-identity because they were tired of violations of
     one of FidoNet's first rule:  Thou shalt not excessively annoy
     others. Many hoped for peace of mind in AlterNet; many simply
     joined it in case it worked well and still maintained FidoNet
     connections, hoping that one day the nets would work together,
     and their node could be a gateway.  Nobody but the SysOp who
     joins AlterNet knows why, but the solid fact remains: ALTERNET IS
     HERE.

          Okay, what do we do about it?  The IFNA Echo is loaded with
     opinions on AlterNet and what to do about it.

          For the most part I see two REAL options:

          1.  Leave them alone and hope it fails so they come home to
              FidoNet; hopefully they will help us grind through the
              problems of being a Non-Profit Organization and getting
              the controls we're legally required to have and the
              freedom we need to keep FidoNet in its current
              structure.  Perhaps they would then get back in the
     FidoNews 5-08                Page 9                   22 Feb 1988


              batter's box, helping us to clean up FidoNet, assisting
              in enforcing policies that encourage SysOps to politely
              state their point of view, rather than stoop down to
              what has apparently become known as "flaming".

          2.  Communicate with them, regardless of their success rate,
              and find a way to link both NodeLists together in such a
              way that Me, the NitNoy user in FidoNet, can send a
              message to my friend in an area best covered by
              AlterNet, or better yet, to my friend who has called an
              AlterNet BBS his "home" board and sees no reason to
              subscribe to another.

          Note that option 1 does not mention any kind of censoring.
     Censorship is a price of its own virtue; it induces a lack of
     communication; this is a destructive force.  Communication is
     meant to be a positive force.  There is no need for censorship in
     an adult community.  I think of FidoNet as an adult community. I
     hope it does not prove me wrong.

          Well, AlterNet is succeeding and AlterNet is growing.  It's
     toolatefor the first of those two options:  ALTERNET IS HERE TO
     STAY.

          That leaves the other option:  cooperation, teamwork and
     COMMUNICATION. That's what it's all about, isn't it?
     Communication?  Not communication in FidoNet.  Communication.
     Plain and simple. The logistics and technical specifications of
     this form of communication aren't simple, but the concept of
     communication IS.


     The Technical Issue:  How do I call AlterNet?

          I've seen three messages in the IFNA echo that prompted this
     article.  I will not name names (as I don't remember them) and I
     will not copy the text of those messages into this article. I may
     quote (or attempt to, from memory), but that's as far as it will
     get.  My point here is to bring out an idea that may make
     communication between FidoNet and AlterNet possible without TOO
     much work from the average SysOp.  In fact, what work could be
     done by the average SysOp would be optional; failure to do the
     little extra work might result in a more expensive operation, but
     the extra few minutes would not be required.

          The third article I read was actually the trigger.  It got
     me to thinking (perhaps a dangerous thing to do), and while
     thinking, I started recalling other messages I'd read. The
     author of this message is obviously a sensible fellow; he's
     already based his message on the assumption that FidoNet and
     AlterNet will be attempting to communicate.  This message
     discussed gateways to AlterNet. It commented on how just having a
     few gateways isn't the way to go; the AlterNet node you were
     trying to call might be in the same town, yet the message would
     go to New York and back to find the gateway (New Yorkers, use
     Sacremento as your example :-)    ).  Rather, the message
     FidoNews 5-08                Page 10                  22 Feb 1988


     directing software would have to be smart enough to find the
     closest AlterNet node, so the SysOp wouldn't have to manually
     look things up in the NodeList.

          The second article I read sarcastically discussed Zone
     organization.  The ending of the message said something like
     "...why not base the zones on area codes?  Naw, that'd be to
     easy...".  I'm sorry the individual felt he had to be sarcastic
     to get his point across; though it worked, I think I would've
     still seen this message if it weren't sarcastic; I feel that I
     would've received the author's point if it were not sarcastic;
     and I feel that I would have been able to apply its logic
     quicker if I were not distracted by the sarcasm.  The author may
     have had previous messages go unnoticed, so perhaps the sarcasm
     was well-founded, or at least well-meant, but I feel that it
     distracted my application of the concept.

          The first of the three articles commented on the Zone
     system, apparently responding to some previous message about
     making AlterNet a separate Zone in our NodeList, and responding
     VERY negatively.  The author got sarcastic, going on about how
     all different Nets could break off and be little Netletts in the
     NodeList, each one under a different Zone.  The sarcasm was
     again not well taken by me, but there was a point in the message
     that made me think about the AlterNet/FidoNet link problem.

          The sarcasm borders on what I believe are currently being
     called "flames", but these messages gave me an idea, and I
     discussed this idea with another programmer, Terry Curtis
     (also a user at 1:128/11), and he augmented my idea some.  Here's
     what we came up with:

          Let's say FidoNet and AlterNet, sensible entities that they
     are, are ready to communicate; both parties have dropped any
     prejudices and dogmas, have agreed that communication is the way
     to go, and are interested in allowing cross-communications.  At
     least for the direct International In/Out type message area.
     Those of you familiar with the operation of Echos will have to
     tackle the usability of this concept with EchoMail.  But for the
     average user out there, who just wants to compose his message on
     a local board and have it sent cheaply to another BBS user on the
     other net, and have that user read it on his local BBS, here's an
     idea that might make it work.

          The NodeList is compiled, or so I've gathered from my
     limited reading of FidoNews and FidoDocs. Therefore, there's some
     kind of data file or database out there at EACH AND EVERY Node on
     the Net. Or, if I'm technically incorrect and NetWork mail is
     routed through the Network and to the Coordinators, then perhaps
     a more technically correct statement is that the data file or
     database is AVAILABLE FOR USE, directly or indirectly, by every
     Node in the Net.  In the case of AlterNet, they're taking the
     same logical structure with them, so the same theory should
     apply.  If there's a data file or database out there, then it can
     be accessed by a program. Obviously, or the Fido/Opus/SEADog/
     TBBS/anything else program wouldn't be able to automatically call
     FidoNews 5-08                Page 11                  22 Feb 1988


     other BBSs in the Net.

          Well, the NodeList is currently Zoned anyway, why NOT place
     AlterNet in a special Zone?  It eliminates problems emminating
     from multiple occurances of Net/Node numbers (since this is
     technically now Zone:Net/Node), and makes communication possible
     on the technical level, while maintaining two seperate
     controlling entities, one in each of the respective networks.

          Okay, now that we can get AlterNet's NodeList into ours as
     a special zone, and ours into theirs, how about the automated
     cost-cutting procedures?  Well, the NodeList has the area codes
     in it, so there's one way to narrow down the costs. Also, how
     about a program that each SysOp COULD run to further reduce costs
     by allowing him or her to enter the local exchanges? There can be
     long-distance billing involved even in a call to a place in the
     same area code, so let each SysOp enter a list of exchanges that
     are consideredlocal calls. Now the program has some criteria as
     to which node in Zone 55 (or whatever Zone AlterNet becomes) is a
     good node to call. Now the program narrows it down to the same
     area code, and, if possible, the list of SysOp-approved
     exchanges.

          From what I can see, for Network Mail anyway, this should
     provide some sort of cost-effectiveness to the cross-net
     communications.  When possible, the program will call within
     the same area code; when possible, it will also make a local
     call within that area code.  Which removes this problem as a
     reason to NOT communicate with other Nets.

          Even AlterNet.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------

          I read a few messages and got an idea.

          I talked with a friend about the idea and made it better.


          Now THAT's what communication is all about.

                   Linking a PBBS to an OPUS/FIDO System

        I've  been looking at the possibilities of linking an  amateur
     radio packet bulletin board system into my OPUS based dial-up BBS
     to provide faster mail forwarding than now currently possible  by
     "normal"  packet  channels. Some background is in order  for  the
     non-hams reading this.

        A PBBS differs considerably from the dial-up systems  commonly
     found in the FIDO(tm) network. A PBBS is a computer system  (most
     often an IBM) using special software and a special modem called a
     TNC  (Terminal Node Controller) connected to an  amateur's  radio
     equipment.  Many PBBS's are found between 145.01 to about  145.09
     Mhz  in many areas of the country. A national channel  at  145.01
     Mhz  carries  much of the message traffic  forwarded  across  the
     country.  Since  channel usage is so high, much of  the  message
     traffic takes from 3 to 10 days to make it from coast to coast.

        I  believe  there is a cost effective way to speed  things  up
     until  such time as a high speed national RF backbone  system  is
     available  to handle the bulk of the message traffic. Here's  the
     plan.

        I've  noticed  quite  a few amateur  radio  operators  running
     network compatible dial-up BBS's from my messages concerning this
     subject  and some preliminary developments in a few of  the  echo
     conferences.  If  some  of those ham  operators  running  network
     compatible dial-up systems also run a packet radio BBS on another
     computer (or the SAME machine using a multi-tasker) it's possible
     to  forward messages between compatible PBBS software by  sending
     plain  ASCII text files using the dial-up network. The  technique
     has  received  some testing in various areas of the  country  but
     never has been tried in the scale I propose to set up.

        I'll not bore FIDONEWS readers who are not hams with the  full
     details  but instead encourage interested and  suitably  equipped
     ham  radio/  BBS operators to contact me at  260/320  via  normal
     netmail.  I'm attempting to get a development echo going so  that
     interested hams can participate. All it takes is a message to  me
     for more information. I'll give you the name of a file to request
     for  that information and set you up for the developer's echo  to
     be hosted by my system.

     WHAT IS OZONE.EXE
     =================

     OZONE is a useful utility designed to make the
     incorporation of the Anetlist into the Nodelist.

     Using Xlatlist 2.85 you can add nodes from the Anetlist
     into the nodelist using the OZONE statement in the control
     file you use with Xlatlist.

     However, as the Anetlist gets larger, this will mean
     adding new entries by hand. So OZONE.EXE was born to help
     in making this task easier.

     OZONE.EXE will read the Anetlist and produce a straight
     text file you can add to the Xlatlist.ctl file. It saves
     you from typing in new OZONE statements each week.


     HOW DO I RUN OZONE.EXE
     ======================

     The correct command line has changed in this version.

     OZONE ZONE# INPUT.FILE.NAME OUTPUT.FILE.NAME

     ZONE# GETS REPLACED WITH THE ZONE NUMBER TO BE PROCESSED.

     INPUT.FILE.NAME GETS REPLACED WITH THE PATH AND NAME OF THE
     ANETLIST YOU WISH TO PROCESS.

     OUTPUT.FILE.NAME GETS REPLACED WITH THE NAME OF THE FILE YOU
     WISH TO CREATE OR YOU CAN USE LPT TO SEND IT TO THE PRINTER.

     DOS redirection is now possible by use of the > Dos command.

     OZONE does not in any way alter either the Anetlist or the
     Nodelist that is being processed.


     WHERE CAN I GET OZONE.EXE
     =========================

     You can either file request it from 107/246 or download
     it from that same board. The request name is OZONE.ARC and
     will be honored at all times except NMH and the hour
     before and after NMH.


     DO I HAVE TO PAY TO USE OZONE.EXE
     =================================

     No payment is required at this time.

     By Gene Coppola 1/114 (107/246)

         I have received many questions on how to set up Quick
     BBS to allow Trade Wars to run properly. This article will
     try to explain what needs to be done to run Trade Wars at
     the current time.

         First, in the ensuing discussion I will be referring
     to TW2.EXE, TWINT500.EXE and TWEDIT.EXE. These and all
     the other files come out of the archive file which is
     named TW2E151B.ARC with a date of 10-02-87 and a file
     length of 277315 bytes. You will also need RBBSDOOR.EXE
     which is available on most Quick BBS systems.

         While the routines presented below may work with most
     versions, they definitely work with the version in the
     archive file listed above.

         Step 1 is simple. Extract the files from the archive
     into your Quick BBS sub-directory. At this time this is
     the BEST place for the Trade Wars files.

         Step 2 is also simple. Extract the files from RBBSDOOR
     into this directory as well. Follow the directions with
     RBBSDOOR and edit the .DEF file to reflect your Name, the
     COM port in use and System Name. Now copy RBBS-PC.DEF to
     RBBS.LOC and edit the .LOC file to reflect a COM port of 0
     instead of your current COM allocation. Both of these
     files will be used later.

         Step 3 involves setting up your menus. Create or add
     to your doors menu a line for Trade Wars. Use menu TYPE 7
     with the following command (data) line:

              RBBSDOOR.EXE *B *F *L *G TW2.EXE

         Assuming that you have done everything properly, this
     will call and run Trade Wars AFTER the steps below have
     been followed.

         Step 4 asks you to exit the menu editor and run
     TWINT500.EXE. Answer the few questions and let it create
     the data files for you. Please READ (Yes, Ollie) READ the
     docs for TRADE WARS at this time! Also included in the
     archive file is a file name READ-ME.DOC. Yes you guessed
     it, this one MUST BE READ. There are several files that
     must be in this sub-directory for Trade Wars to run. They
     are listed in READ-ME.DOC. Check and make sure they are
     all there, or you will certainly be driven crazy later!





         Step 5 gets a little more complicated now. Due to the
     way Trade Wars was designed you need to do the following
     FidoNews 5-08                Page 16                  22 Feb 1988


     to run it in LOCAL mode from the console. First create a
     batch file called TWLOC.BAT as follows:

     echo off

     cd \AAAAAAAA
     ;changes to Quick BBS Sub-Directory (Change to Yours)

     copy rbbs-pc.def rbbs.bak /v
     copy rbbs.loc rbbs-pc.def /v

     ; copies the .DEF to a backup and the .LOC to the
     ; useable .DEF (changes COMx to COM0)

     rbbsdoor.exe 0 First_Name Last_Name 0 tw2.exe

     ; calls RBBSDOOR and creates the needed files
     ; Then runs Trade Wars For You In Local Mode
     ; change the _Names to YOUR Name As Logged In As Sysop

     copy rbbs.bak rbbs-pc.def /v

     ; copies the backup file to the .DEF file
     ; (changes COM0 to Whatever COM You Use)

     cd \AAAAAAAA
     ;changes back to Quick BBS sub-directory

         Please DELETE all lines that start with a ; as these
     are comments for you to help understand what is going on.

         Assuming you have done ALL of the above you can now
     run Trade Wars in the LOCAL mode from the console simply
     by typing TWLOC and RETURN.

         You can also set up a menu line for you to run the
     Editor while on QuickBBS in -L (local) mode by using the
     following command line:

         C:\COMMAND.COM /C :\AAAAAAAA\TWEDIT.BAT *B *F *L *G

         The TWEDIT.BAT file looks like this:

     echo off
     cd \AAAAAAAA
     copy rbbs-pc.def rbbs.bak /v
     copy rbbs.loc rbbs-pc.def /v
     rbbsdoor.exe %1 %2 %3 %4 twedit.exe
     copy rbbs.bak rbbs-pc.def /v
     cd \AAAAAAAA
     exit


         Finally here are some tips while a caller is using
     Trade Wars.

     FidoNews 5-08                Page 17                  22 Feb 1988


         F9 turns ON the snoop mode and allows you to see what
     is going on while he is on-line.

         F8 allows you to change the callers time remaining in
     the Trade Wars Game.

         Trade Wars handles both carrier detect and i/o re-
     direction so NEITHER a watchdog program nor the use of
     CTTY, IBMAUX, or GATEWAY is needed.

     Mental Ward, and Bob Westcott for their help with this.

                            --------------------

        Perhaps the greatest  asked question concerning  the brith of
     Chist is an  astrological event described in  the New Testament.
     The  Star  of  Bethlehem  has been  questioned and researched by
     many  science and  astrological  groups  with  widely  differing
     opinions. We might even say we may never know.

        Here is an opinion held by many as the to explination for the
     Star of Bethlehem. Though what  is contained herein  does not in
     any way mean  it's the actual  truth, it is  what scientist have
     that fits the facts.

                          --------------------

        During the rein of the Romans, a calendar was used based upon
     the founding of the city of Rome.  The Romans  defined this year
     as year 1 A.U.C,  or "ab urbe condita"  which  means  "from  the
     founding of the city". The Romans  did not  have the  concept of
     zeros at the time Rome was founded.  (It was to be thought of by
     the Arabs much later).

        The calendar was changed more than 500 years after Christ had
     been killed, and the  new calendar  was based  upon  his  birth.
     Dionysius Exiguus changed the calendar in the year  533  A.D. He
     had  researched  his  records to determine  the year of  Christs
     birth and had found a  statement made  by Clement  of Alexandria
     which said that Christ  was  born  during the  28'th year of the
     rein of Augustus Caesar. Augustus  was proclaimed Emperor in the
     year of 726 A.U.C.  so he added 28  years to it  giving the year
     754 A.U.C. as the  birth  year  of Christ.  This  year he called
     1 A.D.

        Dionysius was unawair that Augustus had  ruled under the name
     of Octavian for four  years  before  the  title of  Augustus was
     given to him by the Roman Senate. For this reason, we would need
     to subtract four  years from  his calendar  to find  the correct
     birth year.  This would turn out to be 4 B.C.,  or the  year 750
     A.U.C.

        This is fine if you want to rely on historical records, which
     at that time were hundreds of years old,  to be free from error.
     These records were hand written and could not be photocopied.
     FidoNews 5-08                Page 20                  22 Feb 1988


        The New Testament in Matthew says that Christ was born in the
     days of Herod. Josephus who lived in the first century said that
     Herod died a few  days after an  eclipse of the  moon visible in
     Jerico a  few  days  before  the  Passover.  This  date  can  be
     calculated with a good  deal of accuracy to an  eclipse on March
     13, 4 B.C. Passover  was  on  April  12'th.  Herod,  then,  died
     somewhere around the first of April, 4 B.C.

        Remember that Christs parrents  were required  to  pay  their
     taxes in  the  city  of  Bethlehem.  There  are three  major tax
     collections recorded on the walls of temples  in Ankara, Turkey.
     They were 28 B.C.,  which is  too early  for our  tax collection
     year, 8 B.C., and 14 A. D, which  is too  late). This  leaves us
     with the major tax collection year of 8 B.C. This lands us close
     to the 4 B.C. that agrees with our other information.

        The month and day can not be  infered from any information we
     can piece  together at the  moment, yet we  do  know that  early
     Christians  celebrated  the  birth  of Christ  on December 25'th
     because that day was a holiday  for the Romans who  used to feed
     the Early  Christians to lions,  (December 25'th  was the Winter
     Solstice during that time.  The  daylight  hours  start  to grow
     longer).

        If you would like to narrow  the  month  down  a  little, you
     might  look  again at  the Bible at  Luke which states  that the
     shepherds were guiding their flock by night. It was the practice
     of the time to  guard flocks during  the time  of year  that the
     lambs were giving birth.

        So there we have it.  We might be looking at  the spring of 6
     A.D or 7 A.D.,  (A year  or two before  the taxes were due).  We
     must then discover  an astrological event that  occured sometime
     around these years.

        Fireballs, comets,  eclipes, all of  these were  known to the
     peoples of Earth, in the East and in the West.  For this reason,
     we can exclude these type of astrological events.  If every time
     a a comet was seen  in the skys,  we would have wise men seeking
     everywhere all the time.

        We can assume that the "Three Wise Men" were astrologers. Who
     else would be able  to  detect  an  event in  the  heavens  that
     described the location of the King of the Jews?

        Astronomers have  determine the planetary  posistions for the
     suspect years and the results were quite interesting.

        Calculations show that on May 27'th,  7 B.C. , Jupiter passed
     within  one  degree  North  of  Saturn,  falling  into  the same
     celestial longitude and were therefore  in conjunction.  This is
     expected to happen once in about 20 years.

        This particular  conjunction occured  in the constellation of
     Pisces.  In those  days, Pisces  was thought  of as  the "Hebrew
     Sign". Saturn  was  also thought  of as  the "Hebrew  Wanderer".
     FidoNews 5-08                Page 21                  22 Feb 1988


     This made the conjunction very important for the Jewish people.

        The Magi might have  read this  conjunction as a  sign that a
     great man was to  be born  to the Jews. Stellar events  were not
     over  with  yet,  though,  more important movements  in the skys
     further enforced this belief.

        After passing Saturn, Jupiter began to  slow down, and on the
     15'th of July, it stopped.  Then it  began to back up and passed
     Saturn for a second time!  (Backwards  motion  as seen  from the
     Earth is known  as  retrograde motion).  The second passing  had
     taken place on the 5'th of October.

        Twice! This was indeed a great man being born.

        Retrograde motion ended and Jupiter  began to proceed forward
     again on  November  10'th.  Once again  Jupiter passed Saturn on
     December 1'st.

        Three passes of  Saturn  in  one  year,  and  all  in Pisces!
     Further, in Febuary  of 6 B. C.,  Mars came into the picture and
     joined the conjunction  of Jupiter  and Saturn. Three planets in
     Pisces the Hebrew sign,  and three passes of Jupiter, (are these
     three planets  and passes  the reason for describing  three wise
     men?), all within the same year! Let's go find this great Jew!

        You  can ignore all  of these  facts as  conjecture and guess
     work, because that's what they really  are. We do know  that the
     three conjunctions did take place, and in Pisces.  Whether  this
     is enough to  cause astrologers  to look  for Jeasus is unknown.
     In the end, it is you, reader, who has  to weigh  the  facts and
     believe what you will believe.

                             --------------------

     Additional information:

     1) The first conjunction of  27'th of May,  7 B. C.,  would have
        been visible from the East in the morning.

     2) The  second  conjunction  of  October 5'th  would  have  been
        visible in the South at midnight.

     3) The third  conjunction  of  December 1'st, 6 B.C.  would have
        been visible in the West before sunset.

     4) It is said that the Star of Bethlehem moved to stand over the
        spot where  the King of the Jews was to be  born. Taking into
        account the previous three  items  of additional information,
        we might say that the "Star" moved from the East to the West.

     5) For clairification, the word "Star" may mean any astronomical
        object,  being one  item or many.  This is  much the  same as
        describing fish. You may say, "See the fish?" and mean one or
        several. "Star" can also be used to describe a conjunction of
        stars or an occultation of astronomical objects.

     6) There are computer programs being marketed that will describe
        the  attributes  of  planetary  objects  for  the astrologer.
        Though I must admit, I wouldn't spend a  cent on an astrology
        package, these would offer  accurate posistionings. There are
        Public domain  software packages that  do the same thing, yet
        at a less than highly accurate result. The best PD package is
        ASTR-3 or ASTR-4, mailed to all Regional nodes last year.

     7) If you would like to  write your  own  rograms  for  figuring
        planetary posistions, the library will contain books with the
        required formula and  tables. There are also several books in
        print  that   offer  the   astronomer   and  astrologer BASIC
        programs, though  again I wouldn't  spend a cent  on them; PD
        has enough.

                           --------------------

     Additional Reading:

     1) If interested, read the  Bible.  Matthew  and  Luke offer the
        best information  available to  the common questioner  of the
        Star of Bethlehem.

                          Episode 1:  IFNA Powers

     Introduction:

          I seem to  have  formed  a  lot  of  opinions  about FidoNet
     lately, so I figured it was  time  to  send in my IFNA membership
     application and start a  column.    My  understanding is that the
     latter may occur without  the  former,  but I feel strongly about
     FidoNet and its survival, so I'll pitch in my $25 and my 2 cents.

          I can't say specifically  what  this column will cover, it's
     kind of a catch-all; but I suppose for awhile my emphasis will be
     on technical issues of FidoNet  and political issues of IFNA. The
     primary feature to remember  is  that  this  is MY opinion, and I
     believe that EVERYBODY is  entitled  to  one.  I do also believe,
     however, that one should  express  one's  opinions in a clean and
     polite manner.  An old Chinese  proverb goes something like this:

          "The first man in an argument  who  strikes his opponent has
          just  admitted  that  his  argument  is  no  longer  valid."

          I therefore consider resorting to insults and injury (flames
     and censoring?) to be indications  that someone has just accepted
     the fact that he or she has  lost  an  argument, and is unwilling
     or incapable of maturely handling that concept.

          As far as I'm concerned, FidoNet  IS an adult community, and
     immaturity  has  no  place  here   -  except  in  general  humor.

          This week's openner is going  to touch a lot of soft spots -
     and for  those  who  are  close  to  becoming  FidoNet  burnouts,
     perhaps a hardenned spot.  If  anyone is hurt by this, contact me
     via Network Mail and we can  discuss  it. Perhaps your point will
     get published in future editions  of  this column. But I air here
     my opinions, and I  certainly  am  NOT  out  to piss anybody off.

          Enough sales pitch,  let's  delve  into  this  one.  Today's
     topic is -

                         IFNA:  What should it do?

          Yes, there  are  thousands  of  answers  to  this  question;
     peruse the IFNA Echo sometime.    Well,  here's MY opinion.  IFNA
     was originally meant to be  just  another special interest group,
     or so I was given to understand  at  the time.  I've seen several
     recent messages to the  effect  that  this is PRECISELY what IFNA
     FidoNews 5-08                Page 24                  22 Feb 1988


     was when it started.

          Fine, things change (don't  we  ALL know that), and now IFNA
     is trying to become  the  "guardian  of  FidoNet's future."  It's
     a nice thought.  A group of  people,  originally meant to just be
     just  another  SIG,  now  attempting  to  be  a  constructive AND
     RELIABLE source  of  emergency  administration  of the day-to-day
     operation of the Net. And  a  democratically controlled group, at
     that.

          Some people appear  to  have  the  opinion  that IFNA should
     control the net.  Some people  are  afraid that IFNA is TRYING to
     control the net.  Some people  have  the opinion that IFNA should
     go crawl away and die.  Some  people are of the opinion that IFNA
     HAS crawled away and might just  as well die.  Some people aren't
     sure what they  think  IFNA  should  do,  but  that  it should do
     SOMETHING.  And some people  haven't  said didly-squat about what
     they think about IFNA.

          With notable exceptions, the messages on the IFNA echo are a
     strong indication that this last  group is the most desirable. At
     least THEY'RE not out to insult anybody.

          FidoNet started (and I  hope  my  memory of the facts are in
     order) with a group of friends  passing  messages back and forth;
     eventually it got big enough where  some kind of control over the
     NodeList was needed, and  Fido  Policy  was formed.  In the early
     Policy  DOCs,  the  National   Coordinator  was  "top  dog"  (pun
     intended).  He could do ANYTHING he wanted to ANYBODY in the net.
     Right down to excommunicating a node.  It WAS his option. But the
     Policy document stated that such high-level interference would be
     avoided unless the  situation  was  deemed  of  importance to the
     survival of the Net.  Appeals  in  the structure were allowed for
     case decision, and a fair amount  of justice was dealt.  With the
     power came the responsibility.    And everybody assumed that such
     responsibility would be well-bourne.

          I doubt if you'll find  many  people  that would say that it
     was not.

          But the NodeList  kept  growing;  Users  from  all  over the
     world found a great idea in FidoNet; a "free" network service for
     its users (with the added bonus  of cheap Network Mail), allowing
     the speedy communication of Network  Mail at the highest Bps rate
     in the area.  Many such users  became FidoNet SysOps so that they
     could provide  this  great  service  to  their  respective areas.

          And the  story  goes  on.    And  the  National  Coordinator
     position gave way to  the  InterNational  Coordinator as the "top
     dog", and the idea that one person  might someday be overtaxed in
     attempting to keep the  NodeList  current  and properly and fully
     distributed began to form.   And  protection of the NodeList as a
     constantly changing and potentially annoying document became more
     of an issue (I'm referring  to  the  old  lady with the 2am phone
     call from a computer user using  an  outdated NodeList).  And the
     FidoNet's  friendly  association   of  gathering,  known  as  The
     FidoNews 5-08                Page 25                  22 Feb 1988


     InterNational FidoNet Association, thought that the power of many
     might succeed where the  power  of  one  might someday fail.  And
     thus was born the idea that perhaps  IFNA could take over certain
     key responsibilities within the FidoNet structure, and thereby be
     available to step in when the usual source of such administration
     became disabled.

          I faded from FidoNet about  this  time, so my history of how
     the IFNA charter was formed,  the  going Non-profit, the election
     of the BoD and *Cs is somewhat misty.  I am trying to catch up on
     it, but to be honest I'm  still  not  TOTALLY sure just what a *C
     is.

          I returned to FidoNet,  only  to  find massive unrest in the
     Net. Mostly over this IFNA/control  thing. And though I liked the
     idea of an organization  whose  interests  were  to  keep FidoNet
     running, I had no idea just WHERE  I stood on the just what power
     and what limitations  should  be  granted  to  IFNA.   Until now.

          The National Coordinator's  job  was to keep the Net running
     and  help  in  appeal   decisions   when  needed,  and  butt  out
     otherwise.  And, for the most part, this worked.

          IFNA, as I see it, is just  a  voted-in, multi-person entity
     replacing that position.    Let  IFNA  produce  the NodeList; let
     IFNA own the NodeList  from  a  copyright  protection standpoint;
     let IFNA be prepared to step in  if net RULES are being blatantly
     disobeyed; and let IFNA butt  out  for  anything else, except for
     those things that IFNA  has  done  in  the  past, such as prepare
     FidoCon and sundry SIG gatherings.

          This is  fine,  but  "net  rules"  is  a  broad  and  mostly
     undefined term.  The original FidoNet had 3 rules:

          1)  Thou shalt not be excessively annoying;

          2)  Thou shalt not be too easily annoyed;

          3)  Thou shalt honor the National Mail Hour.

          This set of rules  worked  great;  why  not  just keep them?
     They're simple,  they're  direct,  and  without  a  lot  of legal
     wording  they  get   the   point  -  the  CONCEPT  -  of  network
     communication  and  cooperation  across.    So  why  change them?

          The National Coordinator  was  TRUSTED to use good judgement
     in the application of his right  to  step into Net operations; so
     why not TRUST IFNA the same way?   The IFNA BoD members are voted
     in by the SysOps, so  theoretically  they  will act as desired by
     the SysOps they represent  or  lose  the  job.    This indirectly
     gives the SysOp a say in just  what  IS annoying and what is NOT.
     This gives the SysOp a say in  just what constitutes not honoring
     the NMH (is it now the IMH?)  and  what  constitutes a forgivable
     flounder  or  an  unfortunate   mishap.    Through  communication
     (something FidoNet  SHOULD    be  intimately  familiar with (-: )
     between SysOp and BoD member, the  SysOp now indirectly does what
     FidoNews 5-08                Page 26                  22 Feb 1988


     used to be done by the National Coordinator.

          As it should be.

          FidoNet is a  collection  of  SysOps;  therefore  the SysOps
     should run FidoNet. If this  means  IFNA must drop its Non-Profit
     status - do it.  If we are  spending  as much money as I think on
     IFNA stuff,  then  there  won't  be  any  taxes  to  pay  anyway.

          I don't see  much  reason  for  other  powers  to be granted
     IFNA,  as the day-to-day  operation  of  the Net usually requires
     work by each  and  every  SysOp,  Network  Coordinator,  Regional
     Coordinator,  Zone  Coordinator  and  InterNational  Coordinator.

          It always has.

          It always will.

          So why should there be  administrative  interference in this
     technical-level operation?   No  reason I can dream of.  Just let
     the IFNA top brass  take  over  the  real  heart of FidoNet - the
     NodeList.  And make  it  responsible  for  producing it ON TIME -
     EVERY TIME.  Without fail.   With  reasonably planned contingency
     procedures, backup copies  of  NodeLists and trained people to do
     whatever is needed to  get  the  NodeList  out to everybody as if
     nothing had gone wrong.

          Even if the InterNational  Coordinator  died  in a fire that
     consumed him and his entire computer system.

          Even if the IFNA  president's  computer  decided to drop its
     read-write heads onto track 0 of the hard disk.

          Even if 11 people on  a  12-person  IFNA  BoD came down with
     Bubonic  plague.    Number  12  could  step  in  to  produce  and
     distribute the NodeList ON TIME.

          And, in keeping with the  tradition  started by the National
     Coordinator, allow IFNA  to  step  in  if  the members of the net
     decide that the operation  and  survival  of the Net is in danger
     and a situation MUST be corrected.

          Forget all the  other  aspects  of  politics.   Forget legal
     problems of going Non-profit.    Just run the net.  And keep your
     mitts  off  if  things  happen  to  be  working  okay  right now.

          FidoNet kept  working  through  thick  and  thin because all
     FidoNet SysOps shared many threads,  one of which was respect for
     each other.  This rarely broke  down, since the rules were rarely
     broken.

          Why change  that?    It  worked,  you  know.    And  it will
     continue to work, as long  as  that's  all IFNA tries to do. Keep
     the net running.  Absolutely its  primary and possibly only task.
     Just keep that ol' net arunnin'.

     At 10:02 am Chairman of the Board Ken Kaplan called to order the
     third official meeting of the IFNA Board of Directors.  At that
     time, 21 of the 22 directors were present or represented, and
     the 22nd arrived (after a six-hour drive) within the hour.

     Initial reports indicate that the meeting, which so far has
     spanned a fourteen hour period, has been very successful due to
     the implementation of rules which resulted in the automatic
     assignment to sub-committee (for review and recycling) of those
     items of business for which resolution was not reached in
     pre-determined time limits of discussion.

     Among the various items of business were discussions of legal
     implications peculiar to Missouri by IFNA Registered Attorney
     Mark Rubin, presentation of the 1987 Financial Report, reports
     by Divisional Directors and standing committees, and a slate of
     two dozen additional items of old and new business.

     Of particular note was a very exciting presentation by the
     FidoCon '88 organizing committee which indicates that this
     year's will be the biggest and best ever!

     Minutes, financial data, condensations of reports, and
     presentations of the many items of business handled are scheuled
     to be reported in these pages during the coming weeks.

                     IFNA Publications Committee Report
                       December 1987 - February 1988



     PROGRESS DURING THIS PERIOD:

     1.   Thom Henderson resigned as editor of Fidonews.

     2.   Dale Lovell became new editor of Fidonews effective
          January 1, 1988.

     3.   Fidonews is being published weekly as before.

     4.   The 'Open' publication policy is still in effect.


     PROBLEMS:

     Thom Henderson's resignation and subsequent handing over of
     duties to Dale Lovell was accomplished with very little trouble.
     Thom stopped publishing 1 issue earlier the he had agreed which
     meant 1 week without Fidonews, but Dale has kept things running
     smoothly ever since.

     We still receive article submissions that don't even come close
     to specs.  This is resulting in Dale spending much more time than
     should be necessary preparing each week's issue.  He has
     contacted the worst offenders and is planning on mentioning this
     topic in an upcoming editorial.


     PROGNOSIS FOR THE NEXT PERIOD:

     1.  Fidonews business as usual.

     2.  Review documents submitted by Steve Bonine to be used as
         general pamphlets about IFNA/Fidonet.

     3.  Provide services as needed.


     COMMENTS:

     The committee feels and recommends that the current policy on
     Fidonews submissions continue.  In short that policy is:
     'Anything received is published'.  The exception to this is
     anything the Editor feels is libelous, very offensive, or as
     criminal intent.  Who decides these things?  The person we've
     chosen to act as Editor.  After choosing him/her, we must trust
     this person to do the job for which he was appointed.  If we find
     we cannot trust him, we must find someone else.

     As head of the publications committee I feel I should be in
     charge of deciding when it is time to replace the Editor.
     However I am always responsible to recommendations from the BOD

     when necessary.

     Respectfully submitted, Tim Sullivan, Chairperson, 108/62
