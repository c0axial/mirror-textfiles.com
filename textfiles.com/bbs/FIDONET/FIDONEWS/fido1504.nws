     =================================================================

     Zone 1 Echomail weenies are into their election with a vengeance in
     this edition. If you don't follow the admin Echos, you're missing a
     swell slugfest of verbal abuse. This Issue which up to a couple days
     ago was going to be one of the shortest in history has swollen to
     gargantuan proportions with that stuff.

     Speaking of Zones, what in the hell is going on with Zone 6? Anybody
     noticed that it's just about disappeared? Why do we still have NO
     International Coordinator? Do we, the Sysops, have to take over the
     Zone Coordinator jobs en masse with a palace coup to get some kind of
     REAL coordination going? Remember, ZCs, that Tom Jennings, under whose
     auspices you use the name FidoNet has always been in favor of
     wholesale overthrow when the procedure interferes with the process.
     WAKE UP and smell the electrons before you ALL find yourselves out of
     your VOLUNTEER [which doesn't mean permanent OR inactive] jobs in
     FidoNet. Nobody is indispensable or irreplaceable. Think about it and
     then DO SOMETHING CONSTRUCTIVE before WE do it for you.

     Other than that, there is news in cyberspace. Netscape is now FREE!
     There are also a couple new programs available in the Internet that
     make interconnectivity a snap! More on those next week since this
     edition is already huge. AOL Instant Messenger and ICQ for those
     anxious to start searching. [grin]

     This is a late edition due to computer probs on the other system and
     the SuperBowl activities. Who'd a thunk it? Denver not wiped out? It's
     tied! Oh, there's only 1 minute and 47 seconds to go. Might as well
     wait for the outcome and be the first press to get out the news.
     YIKES! Denver scores the lead with 1 minute and 45 seconds to go!

     Final score: DENVER WINS! AMAZING! 31 to 24!!  2149!

     Hi Chris!

     The following revised and final table is a summary of the election
     issues and the pro and con positions candidates have toward the issues
     or questions presented in the Z1_ELECTION echo.  The revisions are
     incorporated as requested by candidates who missed questions the first
     time around, or wished to change their positions.  One additional
     question has also been added to the original list.  There are also
     several brief notes from the candidates, following the table, to
     clarify why no answer, or definitive yes/no response, was provided.

     The issues and questions were selected by going through the message
     base questions posted to the candidates by various participants in the
     Z1_ELECTION echo.  A sampling of 20 key issues or questions were
     selected.

     I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all the candidates for
     their participation in this election and for their time in answering
     the many questions posed throughout the campaign period.

     And to all other Fidonet members in Zone 1, get out there and vote!

     Candidate notes:

     J. Balcom:         Stated he would not stand for R13EC election if
                        elected ZEC, unless requested by R13C.

                        Stated number of hats worn be limited, dependent
                        on voters.

     D. Calafrancesco:  Supports echomail policy which guards against
                        excommunication.

     J. Glinski:        Stated he would seek a replacement for his NEC
                        post but would continue on with Hub duties.

     B. Kohl:           Stated it would be a conflict of interest for a
                        ZEC to create/operate distribution system, but
                        would not be a conflict for other *C, *EC
                        positions.

                        Did not provide an answer on *C's being involved
                        with file distribution as he states it's not a
                        ZEC issue.

     J. Smith           Views ZEC position as working with REC rather
                        than controlling, but acknowledges that ZEC
                        Chairs RECC.

     Anytime a person takes on the responsibility of gathering data on an
     election, the data should be presented in a format to properly address
     the correct views of the candidates and not placed into a format to
     mislead the readers intentionally or otherwise.


     If indeed there is a question of not receiving an answer given the
     occasional quirk of echomail. The person gathering the data should
     request the data either in the echo or via netmail.

     The below information was incorrect as noted by at least 3 candidates.
     I will only address those notations that concern me personally.

     My views are that I'd prefer to see the best person for the job in the
     job, be it by appointment or election. I've seen problems with both
     means.

     Yes I have experience as a mail mover.

     Somewhat misleading, one was a temp or interim REC.

     No. My answer to this was approached on a humorous basis.

     No, we've worked through all the problems we've seen with software
     without a "Ban", excom's, PC's, or whatever.


     Chris, thanks for giving me the opportunity to correct this
     "information".

     Chris.

     I just wanted to comment on my mass advertisement in the Fidonet
     backbone.

     With our net dropping nodes like roaches from raid & down to just One
     Caller, I thought I would try and attract new callers through the
     Internet.  I honestly didn't mean to rile so many moderators!  And I
     hope they can accept my apology!

     You have no idea how many folks out there don't have a local BBS
     anymore to call.  Lots are calling long distance.  Others were told by
     friends about my service.  Even several moderators have praised my
     service & hope it will help repopulate their echos.  I honestly
     believe Telnet Bbs's will become the Fidonet of the next century.

     I have been in Fidonet since '91 & hope to help take FidoNet into the
     millennium!

           This would be my second Letter to the Editor of FidoNews :)
     Please place  this in the next issue of FidoNews.


             What is annoying behavior?  Is it deliberately attacking
     someone?  Is it bad spelling?  Maybe it's just stupidity.  Since the
     decline of BBS usage in the past year, I have noticed a major drop in
     intelligence also.  I really think you, being a node, should call some
     local BBS's not in FidoNet, and encourage growth.  There are some
     groups around the world trying to promote BBSing and FidoNet.  Maybe
     we, the members of FidoNet, could start a collective cause to promote
     this.  Get donations from members, and run commercials on national
     T.V.  Remember, in the end, we are all in this together, the more BBS
     callers, the more posts, the more posts, the more interest, the more
     interest the more BBS's, the more NODES!

     ZEC1 Election Platform Statement
     Bob Kohl
     1:102/861

     For the first time in the history of Zone 1 you the sysop now have
     the ability to vote for a zone Admin position, the ZEC. This
     unprecedented election allows the sysop to finally have a say in the
     matters of echomail and the direction Fidonet takes in the years to
     come in regards to echomail issues.

     I feel that the next ZEC can have a positive influence on the state
     of Fidonet since echomail is such an important part of Fidonet in
     Zone 1.

     As a candidate for the ZEC position I'd like to take a moment to
     present my platform to you. No matter which candidate you prefer
     I sincerely hope that you will make the effort to get out and vote
     this election, it IS important for all of us as sysops in Zone 1.

     ==========================================

     * To work to ensure that FidoNet remains a sysop/hobbyist network.
       There will be no special or political interests served during
       my watch.

     * To work to insure that there will be no "official" FidoNet
       echomail feed that controls or influences any other feed.

       The sysops will remain free to get echomail wherever they wish to
       without restriction in Z1, and that there will not be an "ECHOTAX"
       or Zone CRP, or anything remotely resembling this on my watch.
       Sysops will also be encouraged to develop new software and Fidonet
        Technology.

     * To work to insure that the *ECs remain the coordinators of
       echomail and the people responsible for echomail issues.

     * To work for a "hub standard", in the areas of tampering with the
       mail flow, removal of echo areas from distribution, adding areas
       for distribution  as well as that of moderator rights.

       With the established standard, the moderators and echo areas will
        be treated equally and consistently.

        It is my belief that the use of GMD and other such utilities used
        against specific individuals or for personal agendas should cease.

        Work with the *ECs, hubs and sysops to forge out a program to
        deal with the hubs that will not respect these standards, which
        might range from public postings that denote this to
        possibly requesting that the ZC grant the ZEC the option of
        issuing the hub flags to those nodes that wish to work within
     FIDONEWS 15-04               Page 10                  26 Jan 1998


        these standards. Any hub that does not agree to work within these
        standards will not be issued a hub flag for their nodelist entry.

        That a standard be established for any removals of echo areas
        beyond the scope of Fidonet policy and these standards shall be
        published in Fidonews regularly.

        That any distribution systems, FAQs, policy and/or pledges shall
        not exist contrary to these standards. It is not the intention of
        the ZEC to micromanage distribution systems, but to make sure
        that all echomail services are consistent and treated fairly.

     * To encourage and work to maintain an active and responsible
        group of RECs in Zone 1.

        To ensure all regions equal representation to the RECC. My first
        action will be a request to replace R16EC.

       The RECs will be tasked with maintaining the flow of information
       on important issues from the RECC to the sysops of their respective
        regions. They will do the same with the feedback from the sysops
        on these issues. The sysops will be represented.

        I will make use of FidoNews to keep the sysops updated on all
        issues currently being worked on.

     * The RECC echo WILL be moderated to maintain the echo as a
        environment conducive to getting work done in a positive and/or
        constructive manner and not as a platform for any one agenda or
        for abuse.  Representatives from all major distribution systems
        will be invited to participate as needed if they do not currently
        have access.

        I do not now, nor will I view the RECs as helpers or assistants,
        nor do I view the ZEC as "The Boss".  I view that the ZEC is
        much like the chairman of the board when dealing with the
        RECC, facilitating cooperation rather dictating or manipulating
        it.  No pontificating, no edicts from Mount Olympus, etc.

       Although the RECC has taken it's share of abuse over the past
       couple of years, we worked well to get the Z1EC election going
       again and I'd like to make sure this continues.

       I also feel that it would be appropriate for the RECs to also
       participate in the ZEC echo to their discuss the point of view as
       well as those of their regions on any given issue, as well as
       having access to the ZEC in the ZEC echo.

     * I would appoint a Z1 Webmaster to maintain a Z1 echomail web site
       and coordinate the Z1 web site links.  I realize that there are
       already people working on this, however I would like to see
       someone more aggressively coordinate this effort. The Z1 Webmaster
       would also be there to help those folks that do not have but would
       like to have web sites for their nets and regions.

       The Z1 Web site would maintain information of echomail services,
     FIDONEWS 15-04               Page 11                  26 Jan 1998


       rates, the distribution services "pledges and FAQs", information
       on FidoNet itself and what echomail is about; basically, a full
       service FidoNet site with the emphasis on echomail.

     * On the issue of EchoPol:

       The effort to get an EchoPol established in Z1 will be done on
       several levels.

       First, with the moderator's permission, I will use the FIDOECHOPOL
       echo for public discussions. These discussion will be segmented
       into time periods as announced in FidoNews and in the echo.

       This will not be a free for all, but an organized effort.

        The admin discussion will take place on two levels: the RECC echo
        with the aforementioned crossposting to the regional echo's and in
        the C2C echo that was put in distribution for the all R* level
        admin personnel to discuss issues across the board.  Since both
        these echoes are restricted, updates will be sent to FidoNews and
        the FIDOECHOPOL echo as they develop.

        Bringing the RCs into the discussion is imperative as I see
        it, to establish guidelines on what they feel they can enforce
        under an EchoPol as well as what should not be enforced. On this
        basis was can more clearly define those gray areas as they pertain
        to echomail and echopol. It is crucial that both sides are
        involved in this, since echomail concerns the *ECs and yet it's
        the *Cs that enforce Fidonet policy issues. This will also help
        prevent any possible conflicting portions of EchoPol and help to
        resolve across the board such issues as hubs removing or modifying
        echomail either manually through the abuse of GMD and other
        utilities, etc.

        I will also get the *ECs, distribution systems and moderators that
        care to participate in a discussion echo to resolve the issues of
        UUEncoded files being posted in echo areas, a set of standardized
        parameters for adding echoes to the distribution systems, removing
        echoes and dropping echoes for low traffic.

        Lastly, I'd like to get the moderators involved in one of the
        moderator echoes to deal with issues that concern all of us: those
        of moderator rights and of the hub standards on these issues. I
        will most likely use the MODR8TR echo, since it is not restricted
        and  allows sysop input.  This will of course depend on the
        permission of the moderator of MODR8TR. A discussion of a cut
        request
        standard will also be addressed.

       EchoPol will be developed with sysop level input as the election
     was.

      *My views on specific points:*

     * Sysop level input is as crucial as it was to this election.

     FIDONEWS 15-04               Page 12                  26 Jan 1998


     * Mail moving:

        I do not believe that the hubs moving the mail should be tampering
        with it without justification.  *If* there is a concern about
        legal issues, then it's time to work out a standard to deal with
        this concern.

        I do not believe that a distribution system should jeopardize
        their safety and operation over a potential legal liability
        regarding traffic passing in any given echo. At the same time
        I believe that the distribution systems should inform the ZEC of
        the specific legal issues before dropping an echo from
        distribution, so that the issue can be taken up with all
        distribution systems and hopefully a resolution be arbitrated.

     * Moderator rights:

        I am an old-time moderator since just after the single echo was
        split into the many that have evolved to where we are now.  I
        believe that a moderator should have the final say how the
        moderator runs their echo.  Period.

       *If* during discussions on EchoPol someone comes up with a
       better alternative to "vote with your feet", then I am willing to
       listen.  However, it will be up to the *ECs, sysops, moderators
       and hubs to work through this for a mutual agreement.

        I do believe that the moderators should have a standard for a feed
        cut request. This is a simple issue that will be suggested to
        the moderators.

     * The EchoList:

       This is an entity that should remain separate and uninvolved in
       any affiliations, politics, etc. If there is a backup set up
       passwords, it should remain with the *ECs.

     My qualifications:

        Sysop for well over 10 years.
        Moderator since just after the split of the echoes.
        An NEC for 2-3 years.
        An REC for over 3 years.
        An RC for over 2 years, reviving and rebuilding Region 10 in the
        process after years of neglect. Region 10 has always been properly
        represented, including helping to restore some of the "U" flags
        that the user wanted.  There have been no EXCOMs on my watch and
        only one PC that was denied. I have NEVER filed a PC nor have I
        felt the need to.

     I've put in an exceptional amount of time into FidoNet, both
     promoting it and helping whenever I could. I fully intend to continue
     to do so as your ZEC, making sure that *YOU* the sysop can now have
     a voice in the matters of echomail beyond take it or leave it.

     On a non-Fidonet level, I have been in management for over the past
     FIDONEWS 15-04               Page 13                  26 Jan 1998


     20 years in normal and also in environments that were very political.

     In my other hobby, I've also been a national director for a major
     horse breed association, the equivalent to an RC in Fidonet.

     A proposal to merge Internet-based FTS mailers into Fidonet
     by William Herrera, Node 1:307/1
     (mailto:wherrera@lookout.com, telnet:166.93.38.14)

     As a longtime Fidonet Sysop and past NC, now NEC of 1:307, may I
     propose that:

     1. A NEW zone be made up, say zone 10 or whatever.

     2. This ZONE allows ANY geographic base. Its nets can be countries,
        whatever.

     3. This ZONE uses, indeed REQUIRES TCP/IP addresses for telephone
        numbers.  (or internet domain based addresses, I suppose)

     4. This ZONE requires the ability to do FTS type mailing OVER TELNET
        on a standard port for telnet.

     I could set this up here right now (telnet:lookout.com).

     I think the original reason for zones was calling costs and
     restrictions for calls across zones. Mail could be sent via a
     ZoneGate.  This makes sense for mail across the regular zones and a
     new Internet zone, too!

     This might finally help the nodelist GROW a bit, too. It is easy to
     set up a ZMH TCP/IP mailer on telnet, if you have internet access.

     So what do ye think?

           4.0 IMMEDIATELY FREE FOR ALL USERS, SEEDING MARKET FOR
                     ENTERPRISE AND NETCENTER BUSINESSES

      MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (January 22, 1998) -- Netscape Communications
     Corporation (NASDAQ: NSCP) today announced bold plans to make the
     source code for the next generation of its highly popular Netscape
     Communicator client software available for free licensing on the
     Internet. The company plans to post the source code beginning with the
     first Netscape Communicator 5.0 developer release, expected by the end
     of the first quarter of 1998. This aggressive move will enable
     Netscape to harness the creative power of thousands of programmers on
     the Internet by incorporating their best enhancements into future
     versions of Netscape's software. This strategy is designed to
     accelerate development and free distribution by Netscape of future
     high-quality versions of Netscape Communicator to business customers
     and individuals, further seeding the market for Netscape's enterprise
     solutions and Netcenter business.

     In addition, the company is making its currently available Netscape
     Navigator and Communicator Standard Edition 4.0 software products
     immediately free for all users. With this action, Netscape makes it
     easier than ever for individuals at home, at school or at work to
     choose the world's most popular Internet client software as their
     preferred interface to the Internet.

     "The time is right for us to take the bold action of making our client
     free - and we are going even further by committing to post the source
     code for free for Communicator 5.0," said Jim Barksdale, Netscape's
     president and chief executive officer. "By giving away the source code
     for future versions, we can ignite the creative energies of the entire
     Net community and fuel unprecedented levels of innovation in the
     browser market. Our customers can benefit from world-class technology
     advancements; the development community gains access to a whole new
     market opportunity; and Netscape's core businesses benefit from the
     proliferation of the market-leading client software."

     Netscape plans to make Netscape Communicator 5.0 source code available
     for modification and redistribution beginning later this quarter with
     the first developer release of the product. The company will handle
     free source distribution with a license which allows source code
     modification and redistribution and provides for free availability of
     source code versions, building on the heritage of the GNU Public
     License (GPL), familiar to developers on the Net. Netscape intends to
     create a special Web site service where all interested parties can
     download the source code, post their enhancements, take part in
     newsgroup discussions, and obtain and share Communicator-related
     information with others in the Internet community.  Netscape will also
     continue to develop new technologies and offer periodic certified,
     high-quality, supported releases of its Netscape Communicator and
     Navigator products, incorporating some of the best features created by
     this dynamic community.

     The ubiquity of Netscape's client software facilitates Netscape's
     strategy of linking millions of individuals to businesses. Today's
     announcements will help to further proliferate Netscape's award-
     winning client software which today has an installed base of more than
     FIDONEWS 15-04               Page 15                  26 Jan 1998


     68 million, providing a ready market for businesses using Netscape's
     Networked Enterprise software solutions and Netscape Netcenter
     services. Netscape's research indicates that in the education market
     where Netscape's products are free, the Netscape client software
     commands approximately 90 percent share, indicating that users tend to
     choose Netscape when the choice is freely available. Making its
     browser software free also will enable Netscape to continue to drive
     Internet standards, maximize the number of users on the Internet, and
     expand the third-party community of companies and products that take
     advantage of the Netscape software platform.

     Netscape has successfully shifted its business over the past year
     toward enterprise software sales and to revenues from its Web site
     business, and away from standalone client revenues. In the third
     quarter of 1997, standalone client revenues represented approximately
     18 percent of Netscape's revenue, with the rest coming from enterprise
     software, services and the Web site.  Preliminary results for the
     fourth quarter of 1997, which Netscape announced January 5, show
     standalone client revenues decreased to approximately 13 percent in
     the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter of 1996 by comparison,
     standalone client revenue represented approximately 45 percent of
     Netscape's revenue.

     In conjunction with its free client, Netscape separately announced
     today that it is launching a host of enhanced products and services
     that leverage its free client software to make it easy for enterprise
     and individual customers to adopt Netscape solutions. The new products
     and services reinforce Netscape's strategy of leveraging market
     penetration of its popular client software and its busy Internet site
     to seed further sales of Netscape software solutions in the home and
     business markets. The new products and services include enhanced
     subscription and support packages, an investment protection program
     for Netscape Communicator users, new reduced pricing on Netscape's
     retail and enterprise client products, new Premium Services on its
     Netscape Netcenter online service and Netscape SuiteSpot server
     software upgrades featuring Netscape client software.

     In addition, the company separately announced the launch of an
     aggressive new software distribution program called "Unlimited
     Distribution" to broadly distribute its market-leading Internet client
     software for free.  Unlimited Distribution enables Original Equipment
     Manufacturers (OEMs), Internet Service Providers (ISPs),

     Because there are more than two candidates, a process called
     preferential balloting is being used to prevent the need for any run-
     off elections.  Preferential balloting is explained below:


                          PREFERENTIAL BALLOTING PROCEDURE

     Preferential balloting allows for casting of multiple votes, listed in
     order of preference of candidates.  Through this method, run-off
     elections are usually not necessary.  At all times, the highest ranked
     name is used for each ballot, unless that name has been eliminated in
     any round of tallying.  During each round of tallying, the candidate
     that receives the least number of votes is eliminated.  If that is the
     only candidate listed on a ballot, then that ballot is also eliminated
     and the number of votes needed to win is also reduced accordingly.

     The order goes like this.

     Step 1  -  Count the total number of ballots and determine what the
                number of ballots needed to win would be.

     Step 2  -  Sort the ballots according to the top candidate listed on
                each ballot skipping any names that were eliminated.

     Step 3  -  Tally the votes for each candidate according to the sorted
                order of ballots.

     Step 4  -  Did any candidate receive the necessary number of votes to
                win?  If NO, goto Step 4a.  If YES, goto Step 5.  If no
                further rounds will determine a winner goto Step 6.

     Step 4a -  Eliminate the name of the candidate that received the least
                number of votes scratching off that name from each ballot.
                If that is the only name on a ballot, eliminate that
                ballot.

     Step 5  -  Determine the winner.

     Step 6  -  Send results to the Z1C for further action.


     The process is explained below by example.

     CANDIDATE #1
     CANDIDATE #2       Based on number of ballots, it takes 3 votes
     CANDIDATE #3       to win.
     CANDIDATE #4

      BALLOT #1     BALLOT #2     BALLOT #3     BALLOT #4     BALLOT #5

     Candidate 1   Candidate 1   Candidate 2   Candidate 4   Candidate 4
     Candidate 2   Candidate 3   Candidate 1   Candidate 1   Candidate 3
     Candidate 3   Candidate 4   Candidate 3   Candidate 2   Candidate 2
     Candidate 4   Candidate 2   Candidate 4   Candidate 3   Candidate 1

     On the first tally, the following results occur:

        CANDIDATE # 1   2 votes
        CANDIDATE # 2   1 vote
        CANDIDATE # 3   0 votes
        CANDIDATE # 4   2 votes

     No winner declared...

     Candidate # 3 is eliminated.

     Votes now look like this:

      BALLOT #1     BALLOT #2     BALLOT #3     BALLOT #4     BALLOT #5

     Candidate 1   Candidate 1   Candidate 2   Candidate 4   Candidate 4
     Candidate 2                 Candidate 1   Candidate 1
                   Candidate 4                 Candidate 2   Candidate 2
     Candidate 4   Candidate 2   Candidate 4                 Candidate 1

     Re-tallying votes, first choice must be used when possible, the
     results are:

        CANDIDATE # 1   2 votes
        CANDIDATE # 2   1 vote
        CANDIDATE # 4   2 votes

     No winner declared...

     Because candidate # 2 receives the least number of votes, candidate #2
     is eliminated.

     Votes now look like this:

      BALLOT #1     BALLOT #2     BALLOT #3     BALLOT #4     BALLOT #5

     Candidate 1   Candidate 1                 Candidate 4   Candidate 4
                                 Candidate 1   Candidate 1
                   Candidate 4
     Candidate 4                 Candidate 4                 Candidate 1


     Re-tallying votes, first choice must be used when possible, the
     results are:

       CANDIDATE # 1  3 votes    (Ballot #3's first choice was eliminated)
       CANDIDATE # 4  2 votes

     Candidate # 1 is declared winner as there are the required number of
     FIDONEWS 15-04               Page 19                  26 Jan 1998


     votes cast to receive a majority vote of all ballots.

     If, for some reason, a voter has put Candidate #2 or Candidate #3 for
     all votes, that ballot would have been eliminated at the same time the
     candidate was eliminated as the votes would then be considered as cast
     for an invalid candidate.  At the same time, the number of votes
     needed to win would have been adjusted.  This could have caused a
     problem in our example, as it may have resulted in a tie-vote. At that
     time, the rules of the election would have been used concerning action
     to take in event of a tie vote.

                  ***** END PREFERENTIAL BALLOTING *****

     The voting requirements, taken from the election rules are:

     3) VOTING PERIOD

     Following the campaign period, a period shall be allowed for each
     eligible voter to cast his/her vote. Votes must be sent via direct
     netmail to the election coordinator, or by any other method at the
     discretion of the election coordinator. Votes must be sent during the
     voting period and must include a keyword/password, name and node of
     the person voting (as it appears in the Fidonet nodelist) and the name
     of one of the candidates on the election slate.  If preferential
     balloting is being used, then more than one candidate may be listed in
     order of preference.  Any vote received that does not contain the
     above information will be declared invalid and the ballot will not be
     counted.  Any vote cast that uses a method not approved will be
     declared invalid and the ballot will not be counted.

     Any vote received prior to or after the voting period shall be
     disallowed.  The election coordinator shall acknowledge each vote by
     netmail (direct or routed), or by any other method at the discretion
     of the election coordinator, with a simple statement that the vote has
     been received and recorded.

     In the event there are more than two candidates, the voting method
     shall be that of preferential balloting.

     Any member of Fidonet, Zone 1 is eligible to vote, under the following
     criteria.  Nodes beginning with the keyword of ZONE, REGION, HOST,
     HUB, or DOWN or nodes that are redundant entries are not eligible.
     One vote for sysops with more than one node.  One vote for nodes with
     more than one person listed at that node.  Nodes listed as PVT or HOLD
     are eligible.

     The Fidonet nodelist published prior to the beginning of the voting
     period shall be the primary nodelist to determine eligible voters.
     Allowance for errors in the nodelist may be made by the election
     coordinator, but at all times a valid Fidonet nodelist must be used.

                          *** END VOTING RULE ***

     Sample ballots are listed below:

               VOTING PERIOD IS  January 22, 1998 to February 15, 1998.

                            DO NOT use this as your ballot.

     In this election, there are 7 candidates running for the position of
     Zone 1 Echomail Coordinator (Z1EC).  As such, a procedure called
     preferential balloting is being used to prevent the need for run-off
     elections should no candidate receive a majority vote.  Preferential
     balloting simply means you rank the candidates in order of your
     preference.  If there is a candidate you do not want to vote for,
     simply do not list that candidate on your ballot.  However, understand
     that if all of those candidates that you did list are eliminated in
     any round of tallying, so would your ballot be eliminated. (see
     examples).

     The basic information that is REQUIRED in order for your ballot to be
     counted is as follows:

                       ***** REQUIRED INFORMATION *****

     1)  Your name as it appears in the Fidonet nodelist and your
         node number as it appears in the Fidonet nodelist.

           NOTE:  This information will be posted for verification purposes
                  after the close of the voting period in a list of those
                  who voted listed numerically by node number.  This list
                  will NOT contain the vote or keyword used.

     2)  A password/keyword that is to be used to verify your vote.

           NOTE:  The password/keyword will be posted along with your vote
                  for verification after the close of the voting period in
                  a list containing all of the passwords/keywords and vote
                  associated with that password/keyword listed
                  alphabetically by password/keyword.  This list will not
                  contain voter name or nodenumber.

                  Try to keep the password under 15 characters.  8
                  characters is preferred.  Passwords used that are
                  considered "vulgar" are not acceptable passwords.  What
                  is considered "vulgar" is at my discretion.  In the event
                  that you choose to send an unacceptable password, the
                  password will be changed and I will send you the new
                  password either my routed netmail or e-mail.

     3)  Your Vote - A list of one or more valid candidates names.
                 NOTE:  The first valid candidate name listed on the ballot
                 is first choice, followed by the next valid candidate for
                 second choice and so forth.  Any extraneous ordering
                 information will be ignored.
                 EXAMPLE:  Any numbers listed or other information other
                 than the name of a candidate.  Please list candidates
                 names on separate lines.

                   *****  END OF REQUIRED INFORMATION  *****

     You may send your vote via any of the following methods:
       NOTE:  Please use VOTE for the subject line.  It will make it easier

              ballot, simply a courtesy to the vote counter.

                will need to send it to the above address.

     SAMPLE BALLOTS:
     The following are several types of ballots.  The examples are NOT the
     only types of valid ballots.  Any ballot that contains the REQUIRED
     information, as per the election rules, is considered a valid ballot.
     If the election coordinator is unable to understand your ballot, you
     will receive a netmail (or e-mail) message asking for clarification.

     For these examples, we are going to use the following names as
     candidates:  George Washington, Henry Adams, James Kirk, Joan of Arc,
                  Mary Shepherd, Joe Public, Pat Paulsen

     In SAMPLE BALLOT #3, the numbers that appear next to the names are
     ignored and the names as listed are used as the order of preference.

     In SAMPLE BALLOT #5, the names are used in order listed.  It will be a
     LOT easier on the tallying if each candidate is listed on a separate
     line.

     In preferential balloting, the first valid name that is listed is the
     "preferred" name in counting the ballot. After the votes are tallied,
     if no candidate receives the necessary number of votes to win, the
     candidate that receives the LEAST number of votes is eliminated and
     the votes are then recounted using the first valid name listed.  If a
     candidate has been eliminated, then that name is no longer a valid
     name.  In SAMPLE #1, if George Washington had been eliminated, then so
     would that ballot be eliminated, thus reducing the number of ballots
     by 1.  The number of votes needed to win would also be adjusted.

     In SAMPLE #3, there is an invalid name listed (Jimmy Durante).  This
     name would be considered to be an invalid vote and would not be used.
     If George Washington and Henry Adams were eliminated in any round of
     tallying, then the next valid candidate (Joe Public) would be used as
     the preferred name for SAMPLE #3.  In SAMPLE #2, if George Washington,
     Henry Adams AND James Kirk are all eliminated in any round of
     tallying, then so would the ballot be eliminated, thus reducing the
     number of ballots by 1.  The number of votes needed to win would also
     be adjusted.

     In SAMPLE #4, the voter chose to send the ballot via the internet in
     an e-mail message addressed to mbelcke@ws02.irvbbs.com.  Since the
     header information does not contain the NAME and NODE NUMBER of the

        This is the first part of a serial touching tale to which,
     to some degree or another, I'm sure we can all relate.  It
     originally started out as a gag to entertain my fellow addicts
     in net 354, but by the end of the first episode, the idea struck
     that it may be entertaining to the readers of the snooze as
     well.  So, assuming that it passes the stringent standards of the
     editorial staff of that august body, herewith is part 1 of the
     ongoing story of a BBSaholic:

     Subj : I'm a BBSaholic

     Hi, All!

        My name is Pete S., and I'm a BBSaholic.

        It started the first time I got my first taste.  I can still
     remember the day I walked into a friend's apartment in Burnaby,
     while down there on a semi-annual junket.  He was hunched over this
     amber screen, typing away like a fiend, and I looked over his
     shoulder to see what was going on in there.  Well, he was replying
     to what looked to me like a very interesting discussion about
     something or other, and I instantly wanted to know where the input
     was coming from, did somebody send him a disk to reply to, or did
     the guy send it to him modem to modem, or what.

        Well, he explained to me about Fidonet, echoes, and stuff.  This
     was about 1988, and it was the first I'd ever heard about it.  We
     sucked up a box of beer that afternoon, and he basically hooked me
     on his habit then and there.  I'd never heard of Fidonet, or for all
     that matter, any computer network at all, and as he explained how it
     had evolved, and what it had come to by that time, I just got more
     and more into the idea.  I was fascinated.  This was something that
     my genes had programmed me for from the day I was born.  I know it
     isn't really contagious; that I had the incipient dependence since
     birth, so I don't blame him for my trouble, but just the same, that's
     the day I became a BBSaholic.

        Of course, as soon as I got home, I started shopping for a modem
     for the ol' Kaypro II, and once I had it in place, I started looking
     for a BBS to connect to.  I called my friend in Burnaby, and he dug
     into his nodelist and suggested Bob Shiels' board in Kelowna as my
     closest fix.

        So for a few months, there, I was calling Kelowna LD to support
     my habit. This was with an old Kaypro CP/M computer, with a very
     basic sort of software available.  No .QWK packets or offline
     reading with this baby; I'd get into a message area, start it
     FIDONEWS 15-04               Page 25                  26 Jan 1998


     scrolling messages at 2400 baud, and use text capture to write as
     much as I could get onto a 190K floppy, watching the clock tick
     them minutes by till I couldn't stand it any more, and then terminate
     the connection.  You can imagine how I felt the first few times,
     when I forgot to save the buffer to disk after 6 or 8 minutes online!
     Fortunately, Bob was using good ol' bulletproof Binkleyterm, so
     when I dropped carrier by turning off my external modem (I couldn't
     make the software exit graciously from capture mode,) it didn't
     lock his system up or otherwise get me in trouble.

        Then, I'd ignore friends and family for hours on end, while I
     read this fresh intelligence from all over the planet, on such
     esoteric subjects as to be found in EDUCATOR or ALTMED.  I was
     _fascinated_ with this connectivity!  With seeing people in Australia
     respond to questions from people in Arizona!  It was all I could talk
     about with anybody who would listen.  But soon, BBSaholics start
     talking a language that's all their own, and the more you get into
     it, the more your friends are out of it.  I'm sure you all know what
     I mean.

        I know this is a sad tale already, but it's only starting.  This
     was when I was just chippin' - I was only a User at this point.  Just
     partying on weekends, so to speak.  In further episodes, I'll tell
     you how I got hooked on the Hard Stuff - setting up my own BBS.
     Where we ALL ended up - God Help Us!

     ==================BEGIN FORWARDED MESSAGE==================

     WHAT THE ORGANIZATIONAL CHART DOESN'T TELL YOU

     In the lower ranks of the MIS world, sorting out job titles is a
     nearly impossible task.  Some folks are called Analysts.  Some are
     called Programmers. Some are called Engineers.  None of them has
     window offices.

     So I have listed -- from lowest to highest in order of prestige -- and
     described the 10 most commonly used job titles in a data processing
     shop.

     A truly experienced high-tech professional has held five or even six
     of these positions . . . usually all at the same time.

     10.  Programmer:
          This person holds the lowest rank in the DP field.  Manages no
          one.  Answers to everyone.  Approximately 50% of the Programmer's
          time is scheduled for testing.  Another 50% is spent filling out
          time cards and progress reports.  Any time left over is spent
          attending classes on technologies that will never be used in the
          shop.

          The Programmer is appraised on code quality and reliability.
          Never has time to write any.  Hopes to, someday, be promoted to
          Systems Analyst.

      9.  Systems Analyst:
          The Systems Analyst refuses to code anymore.  Designs new
          systems. Writes specs for new systems.  Devises procedures and
          work flows for new systems but ends up training users on how to
          get by with the old ones.  Next in line for Team Leader position.

      8.  Team Leader:
          A Team Leader manages one project.  Doesn't know why he's not
          called Project Leader;  that's what he has on his resume.

      7.  Project Leader:
          Manages several projects at once.  Analyzes Gantt charts from the
          Team Leaders' projects.  Coordinates schedules from the Team
          Leaders' projects.  Monitors deliverables from the Team Leaders'
          projects. Has absolutely no idea what any of the Team Leaders'
          projects are about. Wants to be a programmer again.

      6.  Operator:
     FIDONEWS 15-04               Page 28                  26 Jan 1998


          The Operator wields powers that the Project Leader can only dream
          about.  Makes Programmers beg for tape drives.  Makes Analysts
          beg for disk space.  Makes Team Leaders beg for printouts.  Has
          an uncanny understanding of career potential in the data
          processing industry. Going to law school at night.

      5.  Systems Programmer:
          Even an Operator wants to be a Systems Programmer.  A Systems
          Programmer has the authority to wipe out disk packs without
          warning.  Crash the system during user demos.  Make new releases
          appear, then disappear, then reappear again, especially during
          month-end processing.

      4.  DBA:
          No one really knows what the Database Administrator does, and no
          one is smart enough to know if the DBA is doing it or not.  But
          every shop must have one DBA, because no place can afford two of
          them.

      3.  Manager:
          The Manager is sometimes called a Director.  Or an Assistant
          Vice-President.  Or an Account Manager.  Has completely lost
          touch with any facsimile of technology.  Wants to finish next
          year's budget.  Wants to finish last year's appraisals.  Wants to
          learn the names of some of the Programmers.  But instead, only
          has time to interview job applicants, especially DBAs.

      2.  Department Secretary:
          The Programmers have word processing.  The Managers have
          electronic mail.  Everyone has automatic phone messaging.  This
          leaves the Department Secretary with all kinds of time to
          manipulate, control and dispense the three most basic employee
          needs:  paychecks, rumors and supplies.  Can make copier self-
          destruct just by going to lunch.

      1.  Contract Programmer:
          A Contract Programmer doesn't have to wear a nice suit.  Or go to
          meetings.  Or fill out time cards.  Or keep complaints to
          himself.  He can make all the mistakes he wants.  He doesn't get
          benefits.  He doesn't get training.  He doesn't get respect.

          But after years in the trenches, the Contract Programmer will
          finally achieve the ultimate goal in the profession:  He will be
          able to make impossible deadlines with inadequate resources for
          desperate managers by putting in all kinds of extra hours... and
          will be paid overtime for every one of them.
