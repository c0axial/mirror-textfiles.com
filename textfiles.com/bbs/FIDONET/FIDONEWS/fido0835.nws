Editorial
by Tom Jennings

FidoCon '91 has come and gone with little fanfare in FidoNews. No
FidoCon articles have been submitted. I was planning to write
*something* but besides not finding the time, I don't know where to
start. It was WHIZ BANG POP then over. Tim Pozar & I spent almost as
much time in the car driving to and fro as at the 'con. It was a good
event; fun and important things happened, I met people I always wanted
to meet, got in arguments I didn't want to get into.

All in all though it was an important event. It proved that there is
collective FidoNet life without a legalistic heirarchy. There was one
area of contention that is hardly new, though recently amplified; the
``commercial'' interests in FidoNet. There was a section of FidoCon '91
set up as a ``trade-show'', with various software and hardware
developers with FidoNet-related wares. There was a *lot* of grumbling
about this. It seemed clear to me personally that those for it were
someone with an existing or potential stake in making money on FidoNet-
related items.

I have mixed feelings on this. First off, there has been people selling
FidoNet related goodies very nearly since the beginning. Thom Henderson
with SEAdog. I've sold Fido/FidoNet commercially since 1985 (as well as
given away the exact same software at the same time). How many of you
got a 9600 baud modem via a ``sysop discount'' of some sort? I think
these have clearly helped FidoNet, not hurt.

Where I think the problem lies, are the un-written assumptions behind
how things generally work; in mainstream U.S. (and Western) society,
commerce carries a high ``worth'' value and greater legitimacy. If two
similar things exist, and one makes money and the other doesn't,
advantage is given to the one with the money. As an illustration only,
the West Coast Computer Faire: in it's early days (under Jim Warren's
direction), it supported a wonderful mix of wierdo fringe hackers (two
clowns with a 6502-based computer on a board selling for $666, named
after a fruit), many hobbiest/club groups, and some more overt
businesses. It acknowledged that the amateurs were the life-blood of
early micro-computer development. After the Faire was sold to commercial
tradeshow people, the oh-so-important hobbiests ended up in the aisles,
if there at all; room was made for groups that paid their way. Now it's
just another marketing trick.

This is what I would be afraid of happening in FidoNet. Certain now-
deceased FidoNet power structures proposed ``solutions'' like requiring
``commercial'' interests to pay to belong to FidoNet, to provide $$$ for
new sysop help/outreach, ``lobbying'' to the EMA, phones, nodelist
distribution, etc. Sounds great, right? Well, it was to set the
precedent of legitimizing commercial use of the FidoNet -- and since
they paid, they'd get to use it for business. Watch for this angle in
the future, and be Sufficiently Paranoid. Yelling anti-commercial
slogans is great and emotionally satisfying, but we need to work out
FidoNews 8-35                  Page 2                       2 Sep 1991


ways and guidelines *now* to prevent this ``legitimacy'' (sic) from
taking over, while not blocking shareware authors or small businesses
that actually strengthen the technical base of FidoNet.

One of my personal crusades is to continually remind people of the
FidoNet's wierdo fag punk author (me) and our decidedly amateur
(actually nice word, go look it up) roots and goals. Though ``we'' have
done some awful things to companies who didn't deserve it (Telebit comes
to mind) I think the overall goal is correct; we simply need to back it
up with cogent thought and actions.


MY PERSONAL TWO CENTS WORTH DEP'T: (FidoNet dirt -- you can skip this)

I apologize (here, out of context for those of you that weren't there,
sorry) for getting hot and bothered on two occasions during the FidoCon;
the ``ethics'' session, and the ``developers roundatable'' on the last
day. Especially getting mad at one network developer (not for talking
over my friend speaking (he can take care of himself), but about making
little of the painfully-gained recent FTSC success of getting out of the
credibility hole we dug). Im my own defense, I will say this: both times
I was dragged in slightly against my will, soon after wakening, when my
blood-sugar (and patience) are at low ebb. You are hereby warned for
future events :-) (Also in my opinion, the ``ethics'' discussion was
really personal morality, and the roundtable quite linear. You may have
your opinions, and I welcome, nay, solicit, them for inclusion in this
publication.)

In regards to the issue of conforming certain aspects of Fido to the
least capable systems, I find myself on the opposite side of the issue
from Mr. Wormsley.  ('Conforming to the Lowest Common Denominator',
Fidonews 831.)  I am of the opinion that this is a good thing, for
several reasons.

One:  The ultimate goal of this medium is communication, the one thing
all participating english-language systems in the Fido network have in
common is the ASCII character set.  I can type this message on my 386
clone MS-DOS machine, and be sure that it will be readable by everyone
with a Fido-compliant computer, which covers a lot of ground these
days.  ("I told you this PET would still be good for something!" :-)

Two:  The less-powerful machines are pushed to the limit just handling
Fido traffic, throwing in filters and converters might require too
much horsepower or more memory for program code than is reasonable.  A
386DX could convert so fast that even at very high speeds it would not
be noticeable.  On the other hand, someone running Fido on a Victor
9000 (Yes, this is possible) may not have the horsepower, or may lack
the ability to program.  Persons under this constraint would be locked
out of some areas of the network.  ("I can't have a motorcycle echo on
my DEC Rainbow because I can't reprogram it to stop choking on the
color codes.")

Three:  On the point of allowing echos to use these codes, this is
fine if the Echo in question is, for technical reasons, confined to
certain types of hardware and its operation, etc.  This is totally
unreasonable for any Echo of interest to more than one hardware
platform.  ("Sure, I'd like to see Enterprise graphics in the TREK
Echo, but how do I read it on my VIC-20?")

Mr. Wormsley points out that Spitfire and WWIV have the capability to
send technicolor messages with graphics, but I would point out that,
to the best of my knowledge, both nets are locked into the IBM
hardware platform.  (I am sure that I will be corrected if I am
wrong.)  This makes it easy as there is only one set of symbols to
contend with.  Are there Macs running on either or both of these nets?
A good question.

Also, Mr. Wormsley complains that confining ourselves to the ASCII set
is stifling the state of the art.  I have to question the art that is
being discussed.  For the goal of communication, text is the primary
tool, all other things should be considered embellishments in most
cases.  There are cases where images or sounds are better suited, but
the medium we are using is best utilized for most communications by
text.

FidoNews 8-35                  Page 5                       2 Sep 1991


Now, and this is the point that is likely to get flames tossed at me,
in my experience, the useful content of messages on a board is an
inverse function of the availability of embellishments like color and
character graphics.  The BBS systems I find to have the highest
content in messages are incapable of anything outside the ASCII set.
These systems attract people who are good with words.  Systems that
allow color and graphics under user control tend to get a lot of
technicolor messages with little in the way of substance.

Specialty Echos for those with specific platforms exist, several were
cited in the original article I am replying to.  This sort of thing is
all well and good, and current rules allow these things to exist as
long as people are warned about the specific nature of the Echo.  In
that sense, Mr. Wormsley's tagged areas are here today.  The vast
majority of echos should be held to the ASCII restrictions, for both
technical and social reasons.

Sysops also have an incentive to hold all but the specialty
conferences to the standard, color and graphics at can easily double
or triple the size of a message, and there enough people out there
kvetching about multi-megabyte compressed mail packets now.  The last
thing we need is to increase the average message size.

The message areas of Fido are one place where the lowest common
denominator is the only reasonable option.  Enhancements are all well
and good, as long as they don't break everything.  Note that mail
transfers these days are routinely done by ZMODEM variants of one form
or another, that does not prevent these slick systems from sending to
an old Fido board, they know how to fall back to Fido's level.
Translating this to messages is harder.  In mail transfer, the more
advanced system takes the responsibility of ensuring the transfer
flies, how on earth can this be applied to mail content?

Those who really want explosion-in-a-paint-factory messages already
have places for them, for the moment, the inter-system standards
should be held to.  The time for a major overhaul of message structure
in Fido is not yet here.

ASP Echo Now Available

We have created a new echo, called ASP, and would like to tell everyone
about it.  It's available to any and all FidoNet users, and not limited
to ASP members. The moderators for the echo are Charles Schell, Mike
Ratledge, and Richard Holler. Charles and Mike are both members of the
ASP, and Richard is the Sysop of a (hopefully soon-to-be) ASP-approved
BBS system, The RoadHouse.

FidoNews 8-35                  Page 6                       2 Sep 1991


The topic of discussion can be anything related to the ASP, whether it
be membership questions, discussion of shareware authors, disk vendors,
ASP benefits, how to join the ASP, ASP-Approved BBS's, etc.

Currently, the echo is available to everyone in REGION11 and REGION13
through the normal distribution channels in those areas. It is being
imported into Canada by 1:140/80.  There is also a node in England that
is willing to import it, and feed it into Europe!

It is also available to *ANYONE* that wants to poll 1:231/290 for it.
We hope to have this echo added to the BackBone soon, but we would like
to get a lot of traffic generated right away.  If you are interested,
set up an echo area called "ASP", and then NetMail Richard Holler at
1:231/290 to set up a poll.

I would like to repeat that this area is NOT just for ASP members, but
it is available to anyone that wants to participate.  Ask your NEC or
REC if they would import it for you, or import it yourself and feed it
to your NEC/REC.  Please show us your interest in this area, so that we
can get it added to the BackBone!

Pace University is running a bulletin board for students,
potential students and the general public. The BBS software
being using is TRITEL, with SEAdog as a front end. A MAXUM
3016D computer is acting as the host with 8 mb of memory.
A total of 252 mb's assures ample storage.

One of the unique features of this system is the fact that
callers may request catalogs and class information about
course being given at Pace, simply by filling out a short
questionnaire on-line. First time callers have access to
the questionnaire, so there is NO delay in asking for
information.

In addition, THE INFORMATION CENTER (TM) has a very large
selection of shareware from ASP authors, a complete Netware
386 file library and over fifteen doors. As a courtesy to
the author of TRITEL, all of the files needed to run this
very nice bulletin board are kept on-line for downloads.

YOU are welcome to call (212) 346-1289 from 7 a.m. to
3 a.m.(EASTERN TIME), 7 days a week. TRITEL is a complete
BBS with a fantastic user interface that is easy to use.
TRITEL has Zmodem built in so file transfers are efficient.

                             VOTEMGR

              - a vote manager for fidonet systems -


    votemgr v1.11 is the latest release of this fine piece of
software by Carlos Terre (2:343/108). votemgr is meant to take
charge of votings carried out at your system.

    It is designed in such a way that "voters" can send messages
to the program, the same way they send messages to areamgr,
areafix, or filefix: voters actually "talk" to votemgr; thus
saving a *lot* of work to the sysop in charge of the voting.

    In return, votemgr will send messages to voters (if you
decide so) to keep them informed of possible errors or to,
simply, acknowledge correct ballot processing.

    Just look:

    o Up to 25 different votings at a time.
    o Value added error control and result computation.
    o Feedback messages to voters.
    o Full control of receipt messages text.
    o Full control of Dates and Electoral periods.
    o Full control of point systems' validation.
    o Public/Secret result reports.
    o NULL votes and Unlisted choices controled.
    o Logging of activities.
    o Processes messages moving them to a backup directory (*.MSG
        format).
    o Backup copies of processed ballots kept apart (.MSG).
    o Results posted into standard packets for tossing in the
        echomail area of your choice by your tosser.
    o Errorlevels reported to DOS. Full automatic operation.
    o ...and more!!!

    votemgr has been successfuly used in region 2:34 when
electing our new RC.

    votemgr unregistered version is freely available for use in
non-commercial environments. If you use it regularly, the author
expects a donation; in return, you will have a registered copy
and support. Registered and UNregistered copies are *identical*,
though.

USSR citizen needs help

Original Message Date: 24 Aug 91 07:54:08
From: Mike Fedyukovich on 2:495/13
To: Tom Jennings on 1:125/111
Subj: Personal problem
^AINTL 1:125/111 2:495/13
 August 18 1991

 Dear sir,


I would like to ask your help in my personal problem.  I'll try to tell
my problems shortly. So...


I'm a very good 44 years old programmer. I live with my daugther Maria,
she is 20 and she is a student. Maria was born in my first marriage.
Then Maria was 12 she left her mother and began to live with me.

 My second daughter Cathy was born in my second marriage. She is 11 and
she lives with her mother in Cnicago Ill USA.

 I tried to emigrate from the USSR 15 years ago, but was stopped by
Maria's mother - she didn't give me permission to leave. There were a
lot of "interesting" things done my first former wife such as
"invitation" to KGB and so on. My career was broken and from the status
of chief of departament (about 40 subordinates) I became a tecnician.

 Now my opinion about emigration has a bit changed. I became older with
all good and bad sides of that process and life in the USSR has changed
too. You see I jumped over in my profession 10- 15 years in future with
a help of "PERESTOYKA" and now I'm in the situation as many programmers
in the USA and many other countries. I have IBM PC AT at home, I have no
need to go every day to my workplace (and I even haven't any), I am very
well paid and I'm absolutely free in my work. On the second hand the
total false and lie of the "soviet way of life" (it was unbearable) have
vanished. It's so wonderful. Really.

 But I have two daughters and I have to think about them. And the life
in the USSR is too hard to save one's best qualities of soul, heart and
mind. And I didn't see my second daughter Cathy two years and I'm very
tired and exhausted because of that. I don't know when I'll be able to
see and touch her again. The only think I want - to live close to her
and to give her (and me and her sister) a chance to be togeher.

 My documents about immigration are in The Processing Center, 1111 North
19th Street, Suite 600, Arlington, VA 22209 phone - (703) 525-43-11. I
know that my question can't be solved without an affidavit of
relationship.
 I'm not a lawyer but I dare to say that I'm punishing by the US
goverment. How can the girl in her 11 fill this affidavit? The more, she
lives with her mother and new family and it's impos- sible for Cathy to
do something "by proxy".

FidoNews 8-35                  Page 9                       2 Sep 1991


 One may say that I hadn't to give a permission Cathy and her mother to
emigrate if I love my daughter so much. But it's unac- ceptable for me
to treat people that way. Perhaps I'm not right but to force a person to
do or not to do something isn't a human behavior.

 Well, I exactly know that my former wife # 2 doesn't fill for me any
document and my problem is: how can I immigrate the USA with the absence
of that affidavit of relationship ?

 Perhaps it's possible to place this message in all & any BBS stations
in the USA and somebody will help me by giving advice or writing to
her/his congressman or suggesting some work for me ... I don't know.

 I'm sure Maria and I can work in the USA and for the USA and we will
not be burden for the American people.

 Our data are:

                      FidoNet: 1:102/901.0

Some of the FidoNet and Internet SysOps and Users (hack-spit)
may already know that the Universal Mayhem project had been
canned forever about one month ago with the source code being
not only erased but formatted over when found.

My killer dog programs, censoring programs, message tossers,
re-addressers, and spelling checks (among others) that I have
written for the FidoNet and Internet world have also been
canned.

FidoNews 8-35                  Page 10                      2 Sep 1991


I had received encouragement and support for the Mayhem project
from various sites around the world: Australia, Hawaii,
Colorado, California, Germany, Ireland... Yet I also received,
in the last four years, about three dozen messages where
demands were made and threats were issued.

It's important, FidoNews reader, that software developers get
the encouragement they need to keep developing. For the most
part, we're in it for the ego trip and not any cash that we
might request; 'registration' of ShareWare is damn-near non-
existent. ShareWare authors, and FreeWare people like me,
_need_ encouragement and walk along the fine edge of
discarding our efforts in bitter discouragement. All it takes
is a 'thank you' and a lack of demands.

RaSpell was delayed in favor of a program that scanned Network
Mail for 'To' names and tossed the mail to other directories
and/or re-addressed the messages based upon configuration
information (project NM-TOSS). When my logs indicate a File
Request for RaSpell, my Form Letter Mail project (FL-MAIL)
notes the entry in the log and sends a prearranged message
(based upon the file requested) to the system that requested
the file. The prearranged letter for RaSpell mentions a lack of
gratitude for my efforts.

Read the following exchange and tell me if 'AW' has the right
to expect anything from me. Tell me if my ass belongs to the
Public Domain just because I've expended the last four years
of my life on ungrateful pursuits.

- - -

FR>> Mayhem Game yet there were just a few individuals that
FR>> had some comments to say about it that turned me off
FR>> to writing _anything_ for the Public Domain ever
FR>> again.

AW> Great. I waited all this time, and now you say you dont even
AW> have it. I dont like people that lie.
AW> A VERY bummed Andy

FR> You didn't 'listen', Andy. For all of my efforts developing
FR> Mayhem these last five years, I've caught shit like yours
FR> without a hint of gratefulness in _all_ the time I've spent
FR> on my projects.

FR> It's selfish people like you that fucked it over for the rest
FR> by 'making' me stop writing network software in the first place.
FR> There was _never_ a hint of gratitude for my efforts.

Preface and Preamble:

       "If there is any fixed star in our constitutional
        constellation, it is that NO official, high or petty, can
        prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics,
        nationalism, religion or other matters of opinion or
        force citizens to  confess by word or act their faith
        therein. If there ARE any circumstances  which permit an
        exception, they do not now occur to us."

     Upon duly submitted and approved petition to the International
     Headquarters of the Universal Life Church, Inc., Elvis Aron
     Presley was named Saint of the Universal Life Church in
     November, 1988.  The petition to the church read as follows:

         Elvis exhibited faith and hope when, as a youngster,
         he pursued his talent as an entertainer despite the
         odds against rising from his humble beginnings. He
         exhibited charity by his obvious and documented

         generosity. All of these attributes of character are
         believed to have been present to an extraordinary
         degree by his followers.



   *****************************************************************

                      ECCLESIASTICAL PROCLAMATION

     WHEREAS the beliefs on matters of death and resurrection are
             especially promulgated during the weekend of the
             First Sunday after the first full moon after the
             Vernal Equinox, and

     WHEREAS these concepts are so closely tied by many in many
             churches to ancient ceremonies of fertility and
             symbolized by Bunnies and Eggs and other esoteric
             symbols of rebirth and new life, and

     WHEREAS the promise of eternal life was extended to everyone
             as far back as 1939 (or even earlier, to hear some
             tell it) and that possibility is recognized by lots
             of folks, and

     WHEREAS the Saturday prior to the Sunday mentioned above has
             heretofore remained generally unclaimed, unnamed,
             and uncelebrated, now,


     THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the Saturday before the First
             Sunday after the first full moon after the Vernal
             Equinox be proclaimed and known as ELVIS SATURDAY
             from this day forward, and be celebrated by the
             faithful in joyous recognition of all Spring
             Festivals associated with rebirth and fertility with
             the eternal melodies of St. Elvis Aron Presley, who
             lives forever in the eternal present.




                      Wherefore I have set my mark and caused to be
                      affixed the seal of the Church of Elvis ULC
                      on this 14th day of April, 1990.

                            THERE's MORE!!!


          The CHURCH OF ELVIS is a sect of the Universal Life
                Church and is looking for new ministers.



                           ABOUT MINISTERHOOD

-- Is This For Real?

 Yes, it is.  The Universal Life Church will ordain anyone, for
life, no questions asked, and at no cost.  The ordination is
legally valid, and, after registering with local authorities, ULC
Ministers can legally perform weddings, funerals, baptisms, etc.


-- But I Have To Believe In Something Silly, Right?

 Nope.  The ULC doesn't impose ANY beliefs on it's Ministers or
their congregations.  Your god is OK.  Period.


-- Am I Making Any Promises?

 Only one.  A ULC Minister agrees to do what's "right".  You get
to interpret "right" to your satisfaction.  No one will call to
ask for money.  You're not joining a "cult."  You're welcome
(encouraged!) to continue practicing whatever faith you like.
ULC Ministers are also Catholics, Episcopalians, Methodists,
ELVIS Worshippers... you name it.


-- So How Do I Become Ordained?

 Easy.  Just fill out the simple form below, or call any
CompuChurch (tm) Chartered BBS and go to the Online Ordainments
Menu.  Your info will be processed by CompuChurch (tm)
International Headquarters.  CompuChurch will file your request
with the ULC, and you'll receive your credentials within a
coupla weeks.  It's free, but we could use a stamp!


-- Still A Little Wary?

I've got a used Hard Disk Drive for sale:
* Miniscribe model 8425 - 20 megabyte, MFM, 5-1/4 inch, half height
  The inspection sticker is dated July 1989. I purchased it brand new
  with my computer in June of 1990 and I used it until June of 1991.
  It is in excellent condition - I had no problems with it.
I want to include the controller:
* standard MFM controller - 8-bit XT MFM controller card
  It can handle 2 hard drives, no floppies. There is no port on the back
  for an external drive - the sets of pins are on the inside.
  This is also the same age as the hard drive and has had the same
  usage. It is also in excellent condition.
I'm throwing in the cables. I will include the necessary screws and AT
rails with the drive.
* Make me an offer!!!
