                           More LHARC Garbage
                           ---- ----- -------
     Garner Miller
     1:109/328


     I'm always amazed at how inconsiderate people can be to
     others in an organization without even realizing it.  I truly
     believe this is the case with Vince Perriello's LHARC fiasco:
     I think he really did mean well.  Unfortunately, his well-
     meaning actions didn't go over well with FidoNet as a whole,
     and as for machines that aren't MS-DOS, it's an even more
     unpleasant story.

     The FidoNews article specifications state very clearly
     that authors should take into consideration that "Not everyone
     in the world has an IBM PC."  Jeez - you guys must not have
     taken a look at that document for a long, long time if you've
     forgotten such a policy.  The simple truth is that there isn't
     a reliable LHARC program available for the Macintosh.  The only
     two that I know exist (One I got through SDS; the other I just
     happened to have) are both excruciatingly slow -- when they
     work, that is.  How often is that?  For most, less than 10% of
     the time.  The other 90%+ the program simply crashes and dies,
     forcing me to restart the machine.

     I know, I know -- let me guess what's coming next:
     "The algorithm is in the public domain, so anyone should be
     able to port it."  Let me clue you all in on a piece of news,
     folks: =WE ARE NOT ALL PROGRAMMERS=  To the developers, it
     seems silly; perhaps even trivial.  But to the average user,
     it's the simple truth.  I shouldn't have to write a program
     to be able to participate in FidoNet.  We already have a
     standard that works -- when Fido people see ".ARC," they most
     often think of the ARC 5.12 that we're all able to deal with.
     It's taken many, many years for that to become a standard, and
     now, all of a sudden, Vince Perriello decides on his own that
     he doesn't care for it, so he has the right to change the
     format in which the newsletter is distributed?  Come on, guy.
     That's simply not fair to the network.

     I read with great interest Vince's article in FidoNews
     734 -- almost with awe, in fact.  He says, and I quote:

     "Did your batch file break [because of the format change]?  I
     apologize.  Should I have given you some warning so you could
     fix it beforehand?  Maybe.  Would this advance notice have
     been interpreted as license to start a NET_DEV-style
     filibuster?  I think so."

     FidoNews 7-38                Page 2                   17 Sep 1990


     Great strategy, Vince:  Do it quick and quiet -- that way,
     when they find out, it'll be too late.  I believe similar
     strategies were used for bombing runs in WWII.

     So, of course, as a recourse for those that can continue to
     read the article without ripping the page in half, he
     continues on, saying...

     "However, before FidoNews went out in a .LZH file, I consulted
     the International Coordinator, the Zone 1 Coordinator, and the
     holder of the Trademark. Nobody cautioned me not to do it.
     Nobody told me not to do it...Nobody felt the world would come
     to an end if I made the change."

     You know why nobody told you not to do it, Vince?  Because you
     didn't ask.  You asked a grand total of three people, in a
     network of many thousands.  Those three people, as well as
     yourself, run DOS systems.  You never bothered to check with
     the people who might not have their systems configured right.
     You never bothered to check to see if any platforms don't have
     LHARC readily available.  You never bothered to check how your
     decision would affect FidoNet.  To use your phrase, "That's
     intolerable."

     Mr. Perriello concludes with, "This thread is now ended.
     Let's get conversation regarding FidoNews back to what's in
     it and not what it's in."

     That's a good point - I'd love to quit the whole
     converation. But a thread doesn't end when you say it does.
     You've had your say.  Let's give the other several thousand
     THEIR turn to decide what to do with the newsletter.

     The only reason I'm even able to read FidoNews these days
     is because of the generousity of a member of Net 109 who
     sends me ARC copies.  (It could only be expected from such
     a great group of people.)   The thread is ended when FidoNet
     comes to a solution on which we all agree.  John Passaniti's
     idea of a compression standard is an excellent one.  Lucklily,
     one has already been established:  It's called SEA ARC 5.12.

     If you don't like the .ARC extension, fine.  Let's all
     call our ARC 5.12 files ".5RC," ".A5C," or something along
     those lines.  Our NODELIST is officially distributed in ARC
     5.12 format.  Our NODEDIFF files each week are distributed
     in that same format.  It's only fitting that the FidoNews
     files be distributed thes same way.   There _IS_ a reason the
     NODELIST files are in that ARC format:  They know it's the
     only format that all the members of FidoNet support.  We
     all have our favorite compressors.  Mine happens to be one
     called Compactor -- it can squeeze 65-70% off the NODELIST,
     and about 90-93% off a TIFF file.  Ever heard of it?  Didn't
     think so.  Just as I hadn't heard of LHARC until a short
     while ago.

     So come on, Vince - don't just be sorry.  Do something to
     rectify the situation.  We can all appreciate your "firmly
     standing behind your decision."  However, I know I'm not
     alone in believing that changing your decision would be the
     better move, if it would work for the ultimate good of
     FidoNet.  Believe me, it would.

     Think about it.

                   RESPONSE TO MIKE ROBESON'S ARTICLES

     Fidonews Volume 7, Number 35 carried no less than three
     articles on environmental awareness by Mike Robeson of Fido
     1:350/21.0.  As some readers may be aware, I've long questioned
     whether Fidonews should be used as a forum for topics that have
     nothing to do with computers, communications, Fidonet or at
     least somewhat related topics.  About the only similarity
     between recycling centers and echomail is that sometimes
     they're both full of garbage (sorry, couldn't resist).

     Anyway, one reason I oppose the use of Fidonews in this manner
     is because it tends to give a one-sided view of any particular
     issue... namely, that of the author of the article.  In many
     cases the "opposite side" may wish to have equal time, then
     rebuttals follow rebuttals and pretty soon you get a 100K+
     issue of which maybe 10K has anything to do with Fidonet.  That
     would not be objectionable except for the fact that NC's are
     required by Policy to carry Fidonews and make it available to
     those in their net, and if Fidonews starts carrying a lot of
     unwanted material, we may see a revolt against that part of
     Policy someday.

     Actually, for a general interest publication I would not find
     Mike's article particularly objectionable... he kept his
     arguments clear and reasonable, and avoided the use of
     questionable language.  I have a lot of respect for him because
     of that.  At the same time, I do disagree with a few minor
     points in those articles.

     Part of the problem is that many groups (including SOME, but by
     no means all of the groups involved in the environmental
     movement) have "hidden" political agendas.  These folks are not
     so concerned with the environment as they are with amassing
     political power for themselves!  The problem is that some of
     the information they disseminate may be inaccurate, or just
     plain wrong (since they really don't care about the environment
     anyway, their involvement in the cause is just a means toward
     the end of giving them political clout), yet other groups will
     pick it up and reprint it and reuse that information (in the
     best tradition of recycling) and when the inaccurate
     information is repeated often enough, the general public
     becomes convinced that it must be true (because "I've heard it
     so many different places!").

     To give but one example, one of the points in Mike's articles
     advises you to "Avoid plastic and polystyrene (styrofoam)
     products that are neither reusable nor easily recyclable, such
     as disposable diapers, lighters razors and plastic utensils.
     (Plastics make up 25% of our garbage by volume.)"

     FidoNews 7-38                Page 5                   17 Sep 1990


     Actually, plastic is one of the safest substances to put into a
     landfill, because it is chemically inert.  That is, it doesn't
     break down after a few or even many years.  This offends the
     sensibilities of some folks, who have the idea that all
     manufactured item should decay over time.  But the fact of the
     matter is that if you don't use plastic, you will likely
     replace it with something that WILL decay over time.  Now which
     would you rather have in a landfill, something that stays put
     and doesn't release any harmful substances into the ground
     water, or something that's going to decay over the next few
     years (and release who knows what into the water supply while
     doing so)?

     Consider the styrofoam container that you purchase a super size
     hamburger in.  In some areas the environmentalists have pushed
     to outlaw these, probably because some organization that
     they're networked with said that they should.  Well, if you
     want to take some visible action and impress folks with how
     powerful your organization is, I suppose that's one way to do
     it.  And if the organization that's telling you to do this is
     receiving some funding from the paper industry, who cares?  But
     the fact is that you could put thousands of those styrofoam
     containers into a landfill and the runoff would never kill a
     single fish.  On the other hand, if you replace the styrofoam
     containers with paper ones that are "biodegradeable" (that is
     to say, they will rot) then the chemicals used to produce the
     paper plus the chemicals in any inks or dyes used on the paper
     will be released into the surrounding environment (sooner or
     later).  If I had to live next to a landfill, I'd much sooner
     live next to the one filled with plastic, thank you.

     Another point in Mike's article:  "Use products that are made
     to be used many times, such as cloth diapers, cloth napkins,
     towels and rags, sponges, dishes, silver-ware, rechargeable
     batteries, etc."

     Now, while this is generally good advice, one could make the
     point that using cloth diapers requires energy to get them
     clean.  Mothers aren't going down to the nearest stream and
     beating them with rocks to clean them (if they did, someone
     would no doubt complain about the discharge of raw sewage into
     the stream).  Instead, they usually put them into their
     electric washing machine with plenty of detergent and bleach,
     and then dry them in their electric dryer, increasing the
     consumption of whatever fuel source their local electric
     utility is using ("Dirty" coal, perhaps?) and the wastewater
     containing the detergent (Phosphates, anyone?) and bleach go
     into the local wastewater treatment facility and eventually
     back into the groundwater supply.  I should add that we've used
     cloth diapers with all our children (even before it was
     fashionable to do so), but I just think that the claim that
     they are "better for the environment" is a bit dubious.

     FidoNews 7-38                Page 6                   17 Sep 1990


     Oh, and most rechargeable batteries contain nickel and cadmium.
     Cadmium is a heavy metal, and quite toxic if the battery ever
     gets crushed in a landfill (and NiCads DO wear out eventually).
     I'm not saying NiCads aren't safe when properly used, just that
     they have their own disposal problems.

     Then there's the advice that we should "Support a bottle bill
     that establishes a deposit on beverage containers."  That would
     be great if it stopped there (we have such a law in Michigan,
     and it's done wonders to reduce the litter along the highways)
     but then it goes on to say "Bottle bills that call for
     rewashing and reusing bottles are superior to traditional
     bottle bills." I have to believe that Mike has never worked in
     a store and seen the condition that some bottles come back in.
     You see bottles containing all kinds of foreign substances,
     some identifiable (cigarette butts and ashes) and some not.
     You even occasionally see something really disgusting (dead
     rodents or worse).  I sure would not want to drink out of such
     a bottle no matter how well it's been cleaned, but the point is
     that to get such bottles clean enough to re-use, you'd probably
     need to wash them with very hot water, detergents, bleach, or
     some other strong chemical to TRY and cleanse all traces of any
     foreign substances.  And, of course, that wastewater has to go
     somewhere.

     In the article on hazardous waste in the home, it lists such
     items as "Cleaners; Bleach, degreasers, spot removers, rug
     cleaners, disinfectants, toilet cleaners, oven cleaners, drain
     cleaners, septic tank cleaners." Yes, these items are hazardous
     if used incorrectly.  Yes, they should be kept out of the reach
     of children.  Yes, you should read the label directions
     carefully before using them.  But, these are all items which
     improve our quality of life and the overall health of our
     citizens.  Consider, for example, that bleach is used precisely
     because it is effective in killing germs and bacteria that
     carry disease.  I am concerned that often "environmentalists"
     will attempt to get a substance banned or restricted without
     considering the negative health impact that the restricted
     availability of such products may bring.  This is also true of
     insecticides - many environmentalists would like to see these
     banned altogether without even considering the increase in
     disease and the detrimental impact on our food supply that an
     outright ban would bring about.

     I think many in the environmental movement are listening to the
     extremists in some cases, with the danger that if they go too
     far out, the average citizen will reject their message
     entirely.  Any time you push too intensely for any cause, there
     is always the danger of a backlash (and law or no law, you
     can't easily regulate what the average citizen does in his own
     home.  For example, if you pass laws that say that certain
     substances can't be sent out in the garbage collection, then
     some of them will wind up getting flushed down the toilet!).
     You really need the VOLUNTARY cooperation of citizens to make
     it all work, and that won't happen if the average person has a
     mental picture of environmentalists as some sort of extremist
     FidoNews 7-38                Page 7                   17 Sep 1990


     nuts (unfortunately, there are a few who probably are very
     deserving of that label!).

     By the way, I'm not totally knocking Mike's article.  There
     were some very good hints in there.  But is this topic
     appropriate for Fidonews?  I have to wonder.  In any case, I
     hope that everyone will understand that there is often two (or
     more) sides to every issue, and that honorable people can
     disagree on the best way to accomplish a particular goal,
     particular where a topic as sensitive as the environment is
     concerned.

     *NOTICE* *NOTICE* *NOTICE* *NOTICE* *NOTICE* *NOTICE* *NOTICE*

     2 Weeks ago, I wrote a message in FidoNews requesting that
     people send cards to Craig Shergold, a boy with a brain tumor
     who would like to get into the Guiness book of world records
     for the most get-well cards received.

     As it turns out, Craig has already made it into a yet-to-
     be-published edition of Guiness, and the amount of cards
     which continue to pile in are a *major* problem for
     their home and their mail service.

     Therefore, *PLEASE REPLACE* any bulletin about sending
     cards to Craig with a bulletin stating *NOT* to send cards.

     I wish to appologize to all of you who made a special effort
     to help out Craig, and express my thanks to the sysops who
     crashed netmail to me to fill me in on the real story.

     Sincerely,

     Brad Thurber, Productive Resources

                          Hold My Hand, Honey

                           by Kwityer Bychin


     Hello folks! Thought you got rid of me didn't ya!  Hee!  Nope,
     I'm back again to ruffle some feathers.

     What shall we talk about this week? WAIT! I  know!  How  about
     *ME*! Yeah, great idea KB ...

     Seems that I'm famous now. Yep, some  philosopher  named  Mike
     Riddle wrote an "open letter" to  me  a  couple  Snoozes  ago,
     kinda spankin' me on the heinie about me backing up Lighthorse
     Harry  Lee  and  Vince  Perrier  over  the  INFAMOUS,   DEADLY
     LHARC-SNOOZE SCANDAL!

     Oh don't worry KB fans! I'm not gonna beat the  guy  up.  He's
     entitled to his opinion (I guess). But I'll just  say  this...
     You don't have to be a programmer to be in Fidonet. You  don't
     even have to be SMART (God knows there are plenty of those  in
     the nodelist). But hey, if you had to get somebody to  set  up
     your software for you, and if fixing a batch  file  is  a  big
     deal for you, and you bitch that  somebody  changed  something
     and complicated your life, then HEY... Time for a  new  hobby.
     Sorry Riddler, this is a hobby not a baby sitters club ...

     Oooh. Know what we're  going  start  some  dung  flying  about
     now? ARC 7.0, that's what! Yeah...

     Looks like Thom Headbanger, in an effort to keep up  with  the
     Joneses, or the Katz's as it were, unleashed a new version  of
     ARC  that  you  gotta  BUY.  Ain't  no  shareware  deal  HERE,
     Virginia.  And  already  some  people  are  whining  about  it
     "breaking" other compression programs. 'Cuz PAK thinks it  one
     of ITS files, or whatever the deal is, I'm not really sure.

     Again, B.F.D. !!! The situation is SIMPLE  folks.  If  someone
     sends you ARCmail compressed with  this  new  gizmo,  and  you
     didn't  ask  for  it,  and  don't  WANT  it,  then   COMPLAIN.
     Otherwise,  KWITYER  BYCHIN.  This  ARC  7  or  ARC  PLUS   or
     ARC-a-noid or whatever it is thing is no  different  that  any
     OTHER compression arrangement. That  means,  the  only  people
     that should  be  using  ANYTHING  other  than  the  officially
     accepted Fidonet ARC standard, are those  that  WANT  to,  and
     have AGREED with each other to use it, them, those,  whatever.

     ROB ECKERT tells me that since I plugged  his  APINET  in  the
     Snooze, he's been inundated with requests for node numbers and
     wants to choke me. Hee! Well, NICE JOB ROB.

     Oh, and sports fans... The Giants and the Bengals will  be  in
     the Super Bowl, so  save  yourself  the  $$$  moving  messages
     around America suggesting otherwise.

     And finally, the NOW award (Nitwit of the Week).  This  week's
     award goes to Mark Howard, NC 260. Why??? Because there really
     isn't a nitwit that stands head and shoulders above  the  rest
     this week, so Mark will be our default Nitwit in  the  absence
     of a real good one. I mean, Mahatma Ravsik  can  only  get  so

     =================================================================
                           LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
     =================================================================


     Dear Editor,

     This is a response to recent controversies about lharc use in
     Fidonet.  For the record, I fully supported SEA in its battle
     with Phil Katz since ARC has always been primarily a  commer-
     cial  product despite its being available  to Fidonet on a no
     charge basis (until this summer).

     Now, the latest version of Arc is no longer freely available.
     In my opinion, it is time to change the standard  since it is
     against Policy to support one commercial  product to the harm
     of any other.

     I do think that there must be some consideration given to the
     following "requirements", however.  First, the utility chosen
     should be public domain, it should run well under multi-task-
     ing programs, it should be "portable" to other platforms, op-
     erating systems, etc., and it should require as little change
     as possible for the grunt sysop including working with all or
     most currently used utilities.

     Both ARC and PKZIP fail the  public domain requirement.  Both
     are commercial products requiring either purchase or a regis-
     tration fee.

     ZOO and PAK may (or may not be) public domain,  but they fail
     the compatibility test in that they make effective multitask-
     ing with DoubleDos on a 640 K machine impossible due to their
     large memory requirements in the packing mode.

     LHARC is public domain and source is available so it can eas-
     ily (ha ha) be ported to different operating systems.  But it
     too fails the multitasking test on 640K systems, it would not
     be compatible with Xlaxnode, Parselst, etc. since those util-
     ities assume use of Arc, etc.   Besides, it is as slow as sin
     compared to other packers.

     So what is the answer?   How about a utility that's been used
     by many (if not most) in Fidonet for years?   Of course, I am
     referring to ARCA and ARCE by Vern Buerg and Wayne Chin.   It
     is fast, freely available, and (since it assumes the presence
     of earlier, source available versions of ARC) portable to the
     other platforms commonly used in Fidonet.  Some programs will
     require a very minor change (Xlaxnode comes to mind), but the
     file formats and naming conventions will remain the same.  It
     will not require changing multitudinous batch files for those
     lazy sysops (like me) who tend to suffer batchfile prolifera-
     tion constantly.  In fact, all any text editor should be able
     to be told to search for and replace ARC A with ARCA and also
     to search for and replace ARC E with ARCE.   Thus, two passes
     through the batchfiles should be all that's required.  Grant-

     ed, it is not as efficient as Lharc, but it makes up for that
     deficiency with speed, memory usage, etc. as far as this mail
     mover is concerned.

     Finally, it will not render Fidonet and its sysops hostage to
     the whims of a commercial author.  Many drivers choose to use
     U.S. Route 1 in areas where I-95 is a toll road. Sysops ought
     to have the same choice.

     Anyway, that's my opinion for what it's worth.  It and seven-
     ty five cents will get you a cup of coffee in most places.
