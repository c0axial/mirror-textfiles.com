          FidoNet 1:231 in Indianapolis, Indiana, is pleased to announce
     the creation of a web page for the Net. The URL is:

                            http://www.oaktree.net/net231

          While no astounding creation of art, the page lists all of the
     members of Net 231, their BBS names, BBS phone numbers and also
     provides links to web pages of the members of the Net.  Documents
     such as POLICY4.DOC, the local Net operating guidelines and a node
     application form are also available via the web page.  You are
     invited to visit the site and provide your constructive comments on
     ways to improve the page.

     Elections of R50C went crazy

     By Mikhail Ramendik, 2:5020/145.43, ramen@average.org

     WARNING: this question caused much flame in the Russian sysop areas.
     I am not into it either side, in fact I'm not a Node at all. I just
     want to communicate an interesting story.

     It all started as usual. R50C, Basil Dolmatov 2:5020/140, has quietly
     resigned. Elections were announced, Kostya Boyko 2:5020/37 became
     Returning Officer.

     The elections were to end somewhere like February 17. But some mail
     was lost on the way to the RO. So the senders (an entire Net)
     requested a prolongation. The RO granted it to 22 Feb. Then...

     On 19 Feb he announced the results. Dmitry Zavalishin, 2:5020/32, won.

     He claimed that as the mail from the requestors has arrived, the vote
     was over, despite the public announcement of prolongation. Flame
     started here.

     But it did not end here. For the winner got only 44% of the votes
     that came, with Mikel Lavrentyev 2:5020/35 second with 23%. A second
     run - between these two was requested from the RO and finally granted
     by him. But...

     BY THIS TIME, THE OLD RC AND THE ZC HAVE RECOGNIZED THE NEW RC!!!

     So now we have no publicly accepted RC. Anarchy? ;)

     FIDONEWS 14-09               Page 3                    3 Mar 1997


     This situation is very dynamic. In fact it may change by the time
     this article reaches Fidonews. And I hold NO opinion on what side is
     right. But it calls us to some thoughts.

     What has become of the Net which started as just a union of friendly
     SysOps?

     Why has the Founding Father Tom Jennings left his creation? I have
     his answer here in a letter of July 1994. The text of the letter
     makes it clear that this information is not confidential.

     8<

     Personally, I consider "policy4" to be a smelly old crock of shit.
     You can quote me on that, only you will find many people have heard
     me say it before... :-)

     Note that "POLICY4" contains valid procedural advice and information
     -- how to assign numbers, how to define a functional system, and
     such. For that it's fine. Otherwise, the actual policy is intended to
     let a small number of people control the behavior and speech of
     another, larger group of people. I immediately mistrust people who
     propose such things. If they are young enough, I give them time to
     get over it :-)

     8<

     Do we NEED to have this structure, so that the RC elections become
     something like Presidential ones with all the necessary scandals?
     Surely the *backbone* needs management, but then the Net and the
     backbone are not the same, and one theoretically can be a node and
     not link to a backbone.

     I'm NOT proposing anything here. It's just food for thought. And - I
     apologize to Tom Jennings if it was not good to quote his letter.

     In fact, my secret desire is that he would show up here with an
     article explaining his thoughts. Perhaps we have grown old enough to
     understand.

     An Innocent Bystander
     Robert "Not a Sysop" Parson
     Jackalope Junction 1:3822/1


     I've been reading Fidonews with great interest over the past several
     months (actually years, but that's another matter).  Quite a few
     things have sparked my interest, and I thought I'd comment as an
     "interested bystander." (It's true, I'm really not a sysop.)

     I noticed a disturbing trend in the Coordinator's Corner that Zone 1
     FIDONEWS 14-09               Page 4                    3 Mar 1997


     was losing roughly 200 nodes a week, so I started keeping my own stats
     on the Nodelist.  There are some differences, which I attribute mainly
     to the differences in which we are compiling our stats, but generally
     turned up the same thing.  At this rate, Zone 1 will cease to exist in
     midsummer 1998.  By the way, according to the latest report published
     in Fidonews, the number of nodes in North America has now slipped
     below 10,000.  My hat's off to Ward Dossche for compiling and making
     this analysis available.

     On this subject, someone noted a couple months ago that most of the
     nodes in Zone 2 are not BBSs.  His description sounded like most of
     them were glorified points.  If someone could explain this a bit
     better or clear up any misunderstanding on my part, I'd appreciate it.

     Someone else noted (I really should keep Fidonews archived on my
     computer and give these people the appropriate credit.  But again, I'm
     not a Sysop) that a "State of the Network" message/address/whatever
     would be of interest.  There are significant problems with Fidonet
     both technically and internally.  He's in charge, at least nominally,
     and we should demand he say something.

     Election underway for IC and pending for Z1C?  Without notice in
     Fidonews?  After consulting Policy 4, it appears notice of elections
     is not necessary.  Looks like something that needs to be fixed.

     And about that Policy 4...  forget it.  P4 doesn't work.  It's
     outdated and the only reason it's pulled out is when somebody has some
     griping to do.  Should The Powers That Are ever decide to update
     Fidonet Policy, don't bother with P4.whatever.  Scrap the darn thing
     entirely, start fresh, skip a P5 even and go on to P6.  My first
     recommendation is to split it into two documents.  One that is
     specific to technical standards, the other for personnel matters
     (moderators, coordinators, and the ubiquitous etc).  I also think a
     Fidonet Users' Guide for non-sysops would be very helpful.

     Since the latest Big Controversy seems to be Chris Baker's editorship
     of Fidonews, I thought I'd comment on that as well.

     I contacted Donald Tees about taking over the reigns about two years
     ago when he originally announced he was considering resigning.  My
     vision was somewhat different from his and the (unwritten) mission of
     Fidonews.  So, I opted out.  Nobody else picked up the standard.  Late
     last year, Donald disappeared from Fidonet.  After several weeks
     hiatus, and apparently quite a bit of non-action on the part of those
     who had responsibility, Chris began publishing Fidonews.  There are
     some things I would not have done, and a few things I wish I'd thought
     of.  But generally, I think he's doing a good job with this thankless
     position.

     If there's somebody upset enough with Chris' editorship, there's
     nothing to stop them from publishing a competing Fidonews, as long as
     it doesn't actually call itself "Fidonews" or represent itself as the
     "Official Publication of Fidonet."  I think anyone who tries will find
     out exactly how difficult it is.

     Now that I've rattled on a bit, I guess I should tell you what I bring
     FIDONEWS 14-09               Page 5                    3 Mar 1997


     to the table since I've noted I'm not a sysop:  nothing.  I'm just a
     user of a local BBS.  And isn't bringing us users together what
     Fidonet is all about?  I'm keenly interested in the continued
     viability of Fidonet.  And frankly, it looks pretty shaky.

     Document: FSC-0044
     Version:  002
     Date:     07-Oct-1990

        An improved method of duplicate message detection and prevention

                                       Jack Decker
                                     1:154/8@Fidonet

     Status of this document:

          This FSC suggests a proposed protocol for the FidoNet(r)
          community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
          improvements.  Distribution of this document is subject to the
          restrictions stated in the copyright paragraph below.

          Fido and FidoNet are registered marks of Tom Jennings and Fido
          Software.

     Purpose:

     The purpose of this document is to present a proposal for an improved
     method of duplicate message detection and prevention, that could
     eventually replace the existing PATH and SEEN-BY lines currently used
     within Fidonet.  The principal advantages of this method over previous
     schemes is that it is fully Domain-, Zone-, and Point-aware, and that
     it adds far fewer bytes to a message than the current combination of
     SEEN-BY and PATH lines.  It can also be run in parallel with existing
     SEEN-BY and PATH lines for an indefinite period, thus allowing a
     "transition period" of as long as is necessary for software to be
     converted.

     This document is Copyright 1990 by Jack Decker.  However, permission
     is granted for any and all non-commercial use, providing the contents
     of this document are not altered in any way.  Also, permission is
     expressly granted for any use by developers of software primarily
     intended to be used in the Fidonet amateur communications network, or
     in any similar amateur communications network that primarily uses
     Fidonet technology and protocols, whether that software is commercial
     or not.

     Comments on this proposal, and suggestions for improvement are
     FIDONEWS 14-09               Page 7                    3 Mar 1997


     welcomed by the author.  In particular, suggestions on how this
     proposal might be reworded to make the meaning clearer are especially
     welcome.

     A. Definition:

     In this document the characters ^A (caret and capital A) will be used
     to represent a 0x01 (SOH) byte.  It will be most commonly used in
     reference to the "^APTH line", which will be a line that begins with a
     0x01 byte immediately followed by the letters "PTH" (and then by
     additional data as specified below).

     B. Why a new method of duplicate message detection is needed:

     Most of the methods of duplicate message detection currently used in
     Fidonet echomail processing operate by trying to find some
     distinguishing characteristic of an echomail message (whether it be
     something deliberately included in the message, such as an EID, MSGID,
     etc. type of "kludge line", or something which is contained in all
     echomail messages, such as the message header).  Typically, either the
     item being used for duplicate detection itself or a checksum of that
     item is then saved in a data file, and if another item comes in with
     that same distinguishing characteristic, the message is considered to
     be a duplicate message.  The data files used to store previously-seen
     message data can occupy a significant amount of disk space if many
     conferences are carried on a system.

     Unfortunately, all such schemes seem to suffer from the drawback that
     under the proper circumstances, messages that are not duplicates of
     each other may be created with identifying characteristics that are
     similar enough to be falsely recognized as duplicates.  The
     circumstances under which this can happen may differ from method to
     method, but none are totally foolproof.  Thus, it's possible that
     messages may be deleted as duplicates even though in reality they are
     not duplicates, but rather they are simply messages that contain data
     that make them appear to be duplicates.

     The most common cause of duplicate messages is improper echomail
     topology (also known as the infamous "dupe loop").  While there are
     certainly other ways that duplicates can be generated, improper
     topology is far and away the leading cause.  Further, many of the
     current duplicate elimination schemes will NOT catch most of the
     duplicates that are NOT generated as a result of improper topology
     (which is why duplicate messages are seen occasionally, even though
     duplicate message detection schemes are currently in use).

     Unfortunately, if a duplicate killer is to be effective, it must store
     the identifying characteristics for the last several thousand messages
     that have passed through a particular system.  This not only uses up
     disk storage space, it consumes extra processing time during echomail
     processing, since each new arriving message must be compared to the
     data list in the attempt to determine if it is, indeed, a duplicate.

     A better approach would be to store within a message itself data that
     identifies it as having already been received by a particular system,
     before sending it on to another system.  Then, if the same message
     FIDONEWS 14-09               Page 8                    3 Mar 1997


     came back to a given system in a "dupe loop", it would be possible to
     positively identify it as one that has already been seen on that
     particular system.  And, since the data necessary to identify the
     message as a duplicate is stored within the message itself, it is
     possible to use this method without the necessity of storing great
     amounts of data on previously-seen messages (in many implementations
     this alone would save 10K or more of disk space per conference
     carried!).

     Were it not for the fact that the PATH line present in most echomail
     messages does not contain Zone or Point information, we could use it
     for that purpose.  However, since it does not contain that
     information, it cannot and should not be used in that manner.  Another
     drawback of the PATH line is that because it is physically located at
     the end of a message (after the SEEN-BY lines), if only the last part
     of a message is scrambled or deleted, the PATH line information will
     be lost.

     C. Proposal:

     1) A new type of kludge line (commonly known within FIDONET as an
     "IFNA kludge line"), which combines certain characteristics of the
     existing PATH and SEEN-BY lines, will be placed into each echomail
     message.  This line, known as the ^APTH line, will be placed at the
     TOP of the message (not necessarily the first line, but prior to the
     body of the message text).  IMPORTANT: Support for the existing PATH
     and SEEN-BY lines will be retained as long as is necessary to
     accommodate everyone in Fidonet, but eventually the ^APTH line could
     possibly replace both the current PATH and SEEN-BY lines.

     2) The ^APTH line will contain full five-dimensional addressing
     (Zone:Net/Node.Point@Domain), BUT elements that are the same as the
     previous entry in the line need not be repeated (except when a message
     passes to a new domain, in which case the full address of the first
     node in the new domain shall be given).  When the "point" portion of
     an address stands alone, it shall be preceded by at least a "."
     character (to distinguish it from a node address).

     3) If a system is importing messages and finds a message with its own
     address already in the ^APTH line, it will discard the message (unless
     that address is in the very last position on the line... this allows
     for the odd situation where a point or another task on the same system
     has already inserted the system's address in the ^APTH line, or where
     it is desirable to process the same message a second time).

     4) One (and only one) modifier character may appear just AFTER any
     address on the ^APTH line.  When using the ^APTH for duplicate message
     checking only, you may just skip past any such address, unless it's
     your own address (see examples later in this document).  In that case,
     strip the address and the modifier character (in other words, if you
     see your own address but it's immediately followed by a modifier
     character, remove that address, add yours to the end of the ^APTH
     line, and toss the message anyway).  The reason for doing this is to
     allow the design of an echomail processor that doesn't rely on SEEN-
     BY's.  Such a processor could append a modifier character (such as a
     "!") to an address, in order to indicate that "this message hasn't
     FIDONEWS 14-09               Page 9                    3 Mar 1997


     really passed through this node, but don't send it back there" (which
     would be the equivalent of a SEEN-BY statement for that node,
     indicating that this message has already been sent to that node).
     Thus the ^APTH line could eventually take the place of SEEN-BY lines,
     but you could still have a "fully coupled" triangular or rectangular
     topology.  In this case, you'd add the nodes that are part of that
     fully coupled topology to the ^APTH line BEFORE sending the message to
     them, but with the special character after the address.  The receiver
     would know that the message didn't really pass through that node yet,
     but it should NOT send it to that node under any circumstances.

     (Please note that during the initial design of software to create
     ^APTH lines, you would not have to worry about generating the special
     case with the trailing modifier characters, you'd just have to be able
     to handle them as shown in the examples below if you came across one).

     D. Specifications and examples:

     The general specifications for a ^APTH line, and a general outline of
     how an incoming message might be processed follows.

     A valid ^APTH line will contain at a minimum the string ^APTH followed
     by a single space character and the network address of the system that
     created the ^APTH line, in Zone:Net/Node[.Point]@Domain format, where
     ^A is a 0x01 byte (SOH) and the point address is required only if the
     system is a point (specifically, a system that is NOT a point should
     not use .0).

     Once again, the FIRST Fidonet-technology address specified in a ^APTH
     line is expected to contain, at a minimum, Zone, Net, and Node
     numbers, and a valid Domain string preceded by the "@" character.  If
     any of these are missing from the FIRST address, the line should be
     considered defective (exception: See Note 5, "Messages sent to/from
     non-Fidonet-technology networks").  It will be left to the discretion
     of the software author as to how to handle a message with a defective
     ^APTH line.

     Subsequent addresses in the ^APTH line are delimited by spaces and
     should contain only that information that is different from the
     previous entry on the line, except when a message passes into a new
     domain (in which case the full address of the first system in the new
     domain shall be given) or when a bossnode receives a message from a
     point, in which case the bossnode should append its node number only.
     Specific examples follow:

          a. If the Domain and Zone are the same as the previous address,
             but the net is different, then only Net/Node[.Point] should be
             used.

          b. If the Domain, Zone and Net are the same as the previous
             address, but the node is different, then only Node[.Point]
             should be used.

          c. If the Domain, Zone, Net, and Node are the same as the
             previous address, but the point is different, then only .Point
             should be used.  Note that in this case, the period is
     FIDONEWS 14-09               Page 10                   3 Mar 1997


             included.

          d. If the Domain, Zone, Net, and Node are the same as the
             previous address, but the previous address contains a point
             specifier and the receiving system is not a point (i.e., it IS
             the bossnode), then only Node should be used.  .0 (point zero)
             might also be a valid entry in this case, but only if the
             bossnode consistently identifies itself to other systems using
             a full five-dimensional address.  For example, a message that
             originated on 1:234/5.6@Fidonet and went from there to 1:234/5
             would contain a ^APTH line in this format:
                             ^APTH 1:234/5.6@Fidonet 5
             If the bossnode is also considered to be point zero, then
                             ^APTH 1:234/5.6@Fidonet .0
             Would be equally valid.

     In the case of a "fully connected" topology, nodes may be added to the
     ^APTH line even though a message has not actually passed through those
     nodes, to prevent the message from being sent to those nodes.  Such
     nodes should have an exclamation point character ("!") appended to the
     end of the entry, immediately following the node or point number.
     These nodes should be added to the very end of a new or existing ^APTH
     line, after the address of the node which added them.

     For example, suppose that 157/200, 154/9, and 228/6 were in a "fully
     connected" topology.  When a message was received by 157/200 and then
     sent to 154/9 and 228/6, the ^APTH line might look something like
     this:

          ^APTH: 3:711/431.5@Fidonet 431 403 1:124/4210 4115 157/200 154/9!
     228/6!

     When a message arrives on one of the nodes indicated by the
     exclamation point, the exclamation point entry should be removed, and
     the node should add itself to the end of the line in the normal
     manner.  For example, after the message containing the above ^APTH
     line were received at 154/9, it would be modified to read:

          ^APTH: 3:711/431.5@Fidonet 431 403 1:124/4210 4115 157/200 228/6!
     154/9

     Please note that at the time of this proposal, the exclamation point
     (!) is the ONLY "officially recognized" modifier character that can be
     expected to be appended to a ^APTH line address (except for the
     @Domain string, of course), however, the possibility remains that
     someone may figure out a good reason to use a different trailing
     character for some other (but similar) purpose, so I am allowing for
     that possibility by using the generic terminology "modifier character"
     rather than the more specific "exclamation point" throughout this
     document.

     The ^APTH line must be terminated with a carriage return and/or
     linefeed (a carriage return followed by a linefeed is preferred, and
     should be used by all systems capable of generating a carriage
     return/linefeed combination).

     FIDONEWS 14-09               Page 11                   3 Mar 1997


     There is no specified limit on the length of a ^APTH line.  Each
     message should contain only one ^APTH line, even if it extends beyond
     the typical 80 column screen width.  The ^APTH line is primarily
     intended for use by the conference mail processing software, so
     primary consideration is being given to ease of processing the line,
     rather than making it easily human-readable (most software will not
     display kludge lines hidden behind a ^A character in any event).

     E. Pseudo-outline of message processing

     Here is a suggested flow pseudo-outline showing one way that messages
     might be processed in a standalone program that runs between the
     import and export cycles of an existing conference mail processor such
     as ConfMail (this outline assumes that the standard Fido/Opus style
     *.msg files are used, though obviously that need not be the case):

     1.  Open *.msg file for input

     2.  Open temporary file for output

     3.  Copy header (first 190 bytes) from input to output file.  The
         following operations begin immediately following this header.

     4.  Examine each line of input file (a line is delimited by a carriage
         return, linefeed, or any combination thereof) for one of the
         following:

         a.  A blank line - Write to output and examine next line.

         b.  A line containing spaces only - Write to output and examine
             next line.

         c.  A line that begins with a 01 byte (SOH) - GoTo 5.

         d.  A line that does not meet any of the above specifications.

             I.   Create a line containing the string ^APTH followed by a
                  single space character and your network address, in
                  Zone:Net/Node[.Point]@Domain format, where ^A is a 0x01
                  byte (SOH) and the point address is required only if you
                  are a point (specifically, a system that is NOT a point
                  should not necessarily use .0).  This line should be
                  terminated with a carriage return and/or linefeed (a
                  carriage return followed by a linefeed is preferred).

             II.  Write the line created in 4.d.I. to the output file.

             III. Write the line input in 4. to the output file.

             IV.  Goto 9.

     5.  If a line begins with a 0x01 (SOH) byte, examine the keyword
         immediately following it.

         a.  If the keyword is NOT "PTH", write the entire line to output
             and examine the next line (go back to 4).
     FIDONEWS 14-09               Page 12                   3 Mar 1997


     6.  If a line begins with ^APTH, examine each address in the line in
         turn.  Addresses start immediately following the characters "PTH "
         (note the space).

         a.  The FIRST Fidonet-technology address (not counting any
             pseudo-addresses consisting solely of "@Domain") is expected
             to contain, at a minimum, Zone, Net, and Node numbers, and a
             valid Domain string preceded by the "@" character.  If any of
             these are missing from the FIRST Fidonet-technology address,
             the line should be considered defective (See Note 5, "Messages
             sent to/from non-Fidonet-technology networks", for information
             on "@Domain" entries).  It will be left to the discretion of
             the software author as to how to handle a message with a
             defective ^APTH line.

         b.  As each address is found, any Zone, Net, and Node numbers and
             Domain strings found should be stored in temporary variables,
             to be used as defaults for subsequent addresses when only a
             partial address is given.  For example, the first address will
             contain a Zone number.  This should be stored in a temporary
             variable and used as the default Zone for all subsequent
             addresses, until and unless another Zone number is seen in the
             line, at which time that Zone number should be stored in the
             temporary variable and used as the default Zone.

         c.  If an address is found that consists entirely of the "@"
             character (as the first character of the address) followed by
             a domain name (with or without punctuation), all temporary
             variables (defaults) should be cleared (since any subsequent
             Fidonet-technology address should contain full
             Zone:Net/Node[.Point]@Domain information).  Otherwise, such
             pseudo-addresses (consisting solely of @Domain) may be ignored
             at systems that do not serve as inter-network gateways (such
             entries are maintained only by inter-network "gateway"
             software).  However, they should not under any circumstances
             be removed from the ^APTH line.

     7. As each address is found, it should be compared against the
        system's address.  If a match is found:

          a. Check to make sure that the address is not a point address if
             the system's address does not contain a point specifier.  If
             the system's address is given without a point specifier, then
             it should not be considered a match if ANY point address is
             found in the ^APTH line address that is being compared (not
             even .0 - for example, if the address 1:234/5.0 is seen in the
             ^APTH line, and 1:234/5 is the given system address, then it
             is NOT a match).

          b. If the address does match exactly, check to see if a modifier
             character (specifically the "!" character) immediately follows
             the address.  If it does, then that address must be removed
             from the line at that point.

             I.   When removing an address, please make sure that you do
                  not change the address of subsequent entries.  This may
     FIDONEWS 14-09               Page 13                   3 Mar 1997


                  require modification of the next entry on the line, if
                  one exists.  For example, suppose you had a "fully
                  connected" topology where 1:157/200 sent an echo to both
                  1:154/9 and 1:154/970. The ^APTH line might end
                  as follows:
                                  ..... 157/200 154/9! 970!
                  However, after modification of the ^APTH line, it should
                                  read: ..... 157/200 154/970! 9
                  You can see that if 154/9 were simply deleted without
                  regard to what follows on the line, the following
                  (incorrect) line might result:
                                  ..... 157/200 970! 154/9  (THIS IS
                  INCORRECT)
                  The above is incorrect because 154/970 has been
                  transformed into 157/970.

             II.  After removing an address followed by a modifier
                  character, continue to scan any remaining addresses in
                  the ^APTH line in case a match is found later in the
                  line.  If no other matches are found, proceed as if no
                  match had been found.  Goto 8.

          c.  Check to see if the address is the last one on the line (not
              counting addresses that have a modifier character immediately
              following them).  If this address is followed only by the end
              of the line, or ONLY by addresses that have a modifier
              trailing character, then there is a very high probability
              that we have either inadvertently or deliberately processed
              this message twice, and it is not really a duplicate.  In
              this case, the original *.msg file should be left untouched.

              I.   Close both the input and output files.

              II.  Delete the temporary output file.  END.

          d.  If a match is found, and it is not followed by a modifier
              character, and it is not the last address on the ^APTH line,
              then the message is a duplicate message and should be treated
              as such (either by deleting it, or moving it to a "bad
              messages" area or the netmail area).

              I.   Close both the input and output files.

              II.  Delete the temporary output file.

              III. Either delete or move the original .msg input file, as
                   appropriate.  END.

     8.  If the end of the ^APTH line is reached and a match has not been
         found, then add the system's address to the end of the ^APTH line.
         Then write the modified ^APTH line to the output file.

              I.   If one or more addresses with an appended modifier
                   character (used within "fully-coupled" topologies) are
                   to be added to the ^APTH line, they should be added at
                   the very end of the line, after the address of the
     FIDONEWS 14-09               Page 14                   3 Mar 1997


                   system currently processing the message).

     9.  Copy the remainder of the input file to the output file.  Close
         both files.

     10. Delete the input file.

     11. Rename the temporary output filename to the old input filename.
         END.

     [End of outline]

     F.  Additional notes and clarifications:

     Note 1:  In section 7.b.I. I mentioned the necessity of not simply
     deleting a node from the ^APTH line without checking to see if the
     next address in the ^APTH line needs to be modified.  This can easily
     be accomplished if TWO sets of temporary variables are kept, for the
     CURRENT and PREVIOUS Domain, Zone, Net, and Node information (Point
     addresses are NOT kept as defaults, thus there is no need to store
     Point information).  When reading the FIRST address in the ^APTH line,
     the Domain, Zone, Net, and Node information of that address would be
     stored in both the CURRENT and PREVIOUS variables.  Thereafter,
     whenever a new Domain string or  Zone, Net, or Node number is
     explicitly specified in a ^APTH line address, the new value(s) are
     stored in the CURRENT variables, but first the CURRENT values are
     moved to the PREVIOUS values.

     To help visualize this, let's again suppose we have a ^APTH line that
     ends as follows (all of these addresses are in Fidonet Zone 1):

          ..... 157/200 154/9! 970!

     Let's suppose that we are processing this message on 154/9, and will
     need to remove the 154/9! address.  When we encounter 157/200, our
     variables will be set as follows:

            Previous | Current
     Domain  Fidonet | Fidonet
     Zone      1     |    1
     Net       ?     |   157
     Node      ?     |   200

     Now, when we read 154/9, our current values will be moved to the
     previous:

            Previous | Current
     Domain  Fidonet | Fidonet
     Zone      1     |    1
     Net      157    |   154
     Node     200    |    9

     We now have the data we need to determine what needs to be added to
     the next address, after we delete 154/9.  In this case, we need only
     compare the Previous and Current addresses to determine which are
     UNEQUAL.  In this case, the Zone and Domain are the same, but the Net
     FIDONEWS 14-09               Page 15                   3 Mar 1997


     and Node are not.  So, if the following address lacks either the Net
     or Node, we'll have to add those.  Now we delete the 154/9! and look
     at the next address, 970.  At this point our variables will look like
     this:

            Previous | Current
     Domain  Fidonet | Fidonet
     Zone      1     |    1
     Net      154    |   154
     Node      9     |   970

     Again, we compare to see which addresses are UNEQUAL.  In this case,
     only the NODE address is.  So we know we do NOT have to add the NODE
     address, nor do we have to add the Zone or Domain information (because
     they were not different on the first compare).  We only need add those
     address components which were unequal on the first compare, but equal
     on the second compare.  So, in this case, the Net address must be
     added to the next address in the ^APTH line, leaving as a result:

          ..... 157/200 154/970!

     The current system address is then added back in at the end of the
     line, thus:

          ..... 157/200 154/970! 9

     Note that whenever a new Domain is specified, the full address (four-
     or five-dimensional, depending on whether a point address is given)
     must be used.  In other words, an address that includes an "@Domain"
     string but that does not also include the Zone, Net, and Node
     components of the address is considered invalid (it does not meet
     specifications).

     Note 2:  In section 4.d it is suggested that, when a line that is
     neither blank nor a kludge line (that begins with a ^A character) is
     found, a ^APTH line be added at that point.  However, there are
     reports that under certain circumstances (particularly when messages
     are "forwarded" or "hurled"), certain software may insert a non-kludge
     line prior to previously-existing kludge lines in a message.  It
     should be recognized by software authors that a non-kludge line should
     NEVER be inserted in front of existing kludge lines located at the
     start of a message, if those kludge lines are still valid (and if they
     are NOT still valid, they should be removed.  When a message is
     forwarded or hurled, it is probably desirable to remove duplicate
     control information since what is essentially happening is that the
     text of a previous message is being inserted into a NEW message.
     Since the message is new, the "old" duplicate control information is
     no longer valid).

     Software authors that are implementing the ^APTH line in their
     software should never search beyond the first text line of a message
     for the ^APTH line, because if one is found later in the text, it is
     in all probability an old ^APTH line that was inadvertently copied
     over from another message, and is not relevant to the current message.

     Note 3:  This is an optional suggestion, for use during the transition
     FIDONEWS 14-09               Page 16                   3 Mar 1997


     period in which the ^APTH line has to coexist with more traditional
     PATH and SEEN-BY lines.  If ^APTH line checking is being used during
     the import phase of echomail processing in a conference mail
     processor, it might be a good idea to optionally check to make sure
     that all ^APTH line addresses that are in the system's home Zone and
     Domain (including those with an appended modifier character) have been
     properly included in the SEEN-BY lines, and to add any that have not
     been so included.  It should be obvious that ^APTH line addresses that
     are NOT in the system's home Zone and Domain should NOT be added to
     the SEEN-BY lines.  If this feature is implemented, it may be a good
     idea to give the sysop the ability to enable or disable it by means of
     a command line switch or a configuration file option.

     Note 4:  If nodes with trailing modifier characters are inserted into
     a ^APTH line for the purpose of indicating "SEEN-BY" nodes in a fully
     coupled topology, it is permissible (but not required) to include
     those nodes ONLY in the ^APTH lines of messages actually exported to
     the nodes participating in the circular topology.  In other words,
     it's permissible to add such nodes to the ^APTH lines of messages
     during the import cycle, in which case messages with ^APTH lines
     containing the added nodes would be exported to all nodes.  However,
     it's also permissible to add those nodes to the ^APTH line during the
     export cycle, including them only in the ^APTH lines of the nodes that
     need to see them.  Please keep in mind that such nodes are added only
     to the END of the ^APTH line, AFTER the address of the system
     processing the message.  In any event, it's up to the software author
     to implement this feature in such a manner that duplicates will not be
     created.

     Similarly, if a node RECEIVES a message containing a ^APTH line that
     lists nodes with trailing modifier characters, it is permissible to
     remove those nodes from the ^APTH line if it can be positively
     ascertained that they are no longer required.  Generally speaking,
     this should NOT be done unless there is absolutely NO possibility of
     the message being exported to one of the nodes in question.  Note that
     in most situations, if a ^APTH line contains a node with a trailing
     modifier character, but it is followed by a node number (other than
     your own) that does NOT have a trailing modifier character (that is,
     the node with the trailing modifier character is not one of the last
     nodes on the line), then it can usually be safely removed since it
     will have already "passed through" the fully-coupled topology.

     Using the previous example of 157/200, 154/9, and 154/970
     participating in a fully-coupled topology, the ^APTH line as received
     at 154/9 and 154/970 might end as follows:

          ..... 157/200 154/9! 970!

     However, please note that if 157/200 also feeds other nodes that are
     NOT part of this particular fully coupled topology, there is no real
     reason they would have to see the "154/9! 970!" at the end of the
     line.  However, there is no prohibition against including those nodes
     in the ^APTH lines of messages exported to other nodes.

     Once this example message arrives at 154/9, the ^APTH line would be
     changed to look like this:
     FIDONEWS 14-09               Page 17                   3 Mar 1997


          ..... 157/200 154/970! 9

     Now, when this message is exported from 154/9 to another node (154/111
     for example), that node may remove the "154/970!" as long as 154/9
     remains in the ^APTH line, since as long as the message cannot be sent
     back to 154/9, it cannot re-enter the fully-coupled topology.  The
     ^APTH line at this point (after the message is received on 154/111)
     might look like this:

          ..... 157/200 154/9 111

     It would probably not be advisable to remove the "154/970!" at 154/9
     in this example, even if the message has already been exported,
     because the message might need to be re-exported (such as when a new
     board picks up an echo feed).

     When in doubt, nodes with trailing modifier characters (other than
     your own) should be left in the ^APTH line.  While there is a cost of
     a few extra bytes per message if you leave them in, it does not
     compare to the cost of the duplicate messages that could be generated
     if they are removed indiscriminately.

     Note 5:  Messages sent to/from non-Fidonet-technology networks:  When
     a message originates in, or is sent to, a non-Fidonet-technology
     network (a network that does not use the Zone:Net/Node.Point
     addressing format), it is permissible to indicate this in the ^APTH
     line by using the syntax "@Domain" standing alone.  For example, a
     message that comes into Fidonet via a gateway from the Internet might
     show a ^APTH line as follows:

          ^APTH: @Internet 1:114/15@Fidonet 5 ...

     Note that in the above example, the first Fidonet-technology address
     must still contain, at a minimum, Zone, Net, Node, and Domain
     information.

     It's also permissible to show a non-Fidonet-technology network at some
     point in the ^APTH line other than at the beginning, if for some odd
     reason a conference starts out in a Fidonet-technology network, passes
     through a non-Fidonet-technology network, and then is picked up by
     another Fidonet-technology network.  For example,

          ^APTH: [Fidonet addresses] ..... 114/5 15 @Internet
     200:5000/400@Metronet

     Note that "@Internet" stands alone in the above example, meaning that
     the conference originated in Fidonet, passed into the Internet (where
     the ^APTH line was not maintained), and then back into a Fidonet-
     technology network (Metronet in this case).  Note that any Fidonet-
     technology address that follows a standalone Domain specifier must
     contain, at a minimum, Zone, Net, Node, and Domain information.

     The question immediately arises, how do you maintain the original
     Fidonet-technology ^APTH line while the message passes through another
     (non-Fidonet-technology) network?  This could be left solely to the
     discretion of the designers of the gateway software, but in order to
     FIDONEWS 14-09               Page 18                   3 Mar 1997


     maintain a standard that can be followed by authors of different
     gateway software packages, I suggest that the ^APTH line be converted
     to one or more lines that start with the keyword FtnPth (For "Fidonet-
     technology ^APTH line), with the @Domain address of the non-Fidonet-
     technology network to which the message is being passed inserted as
     the last entry in the list.  For example, the following ^APTH line

          ^APTH: 3:711/431.5@Fidonet 431 403 1:124/4210 4115 114/5 15

     ... would be converted to the following ASCII text line in the message
     as sent to the Internet:

          FtnPth: 3:711/431.5@Fidonet 431 403 1:124/4210 4115 114/5 15
     @Internet

     If the receiving network has a line length limitation, then it may be
     necessary to break the ^APTH line into multiple FtnPth lines.

     If the message is later passed back into a Fidonet-technology network,
     the gateway software should ideally be able to take the FtnPth
     information and convert it back to proper ^APTH line syntax, adding
     the name of the network that the message was received from if not the
     same as the last network indicated in the FtnPth line(s).  Of course,
     if no FtnPth lines exist in message, then the gateway software should
     ideally create one, showing the network that the message was received
     from as the first entry in the ^APTH line.

     If this is done correctly (and if non-Fidonet-technology networks can
     be persuaded to leave the FtnPth lines intact), duplicate message
     detection can be maintained even if a message passes through a non-
     Fidonet network.  In addition, those in the other network will have
     access to information showing where the message originated, which
     systems it passed through, and where it entered their network, which
     can be a big help in tracking problem messages.  Finally, this
     information can be used to prevent undesirable message paths (for
     example, a message that enters Fidonet from a non-Fidonet-technology
     network and then is later sent back into that same network at a
     different gateway point, thus causing a potential duplicate message in
     the other network).

     Please note that in the above examples, references to @Internet are
     for example purposes only, and are not intended to specify the
     "correct" domain name (in preference to "UseNet" or "UUCP", for
     example).  Determination of the "correct" domain name for non-Fidonet-
     technology networks may be left to those who operate the domain
     gateways.

     in case you hadn't noticed, there is a new section in FidoNews that
     lists FidoNet-related webpages and websites for Zones, Regions, and
     Nets. these listings also appear on the official FidoNews webpage at:

        http://ddi.digital.net/~cbaker84/fidonews.html

     and at the FidoNews HTML page listed in the Masthead each week.

     i would appreciate all ZCs and RCs passing this request down their
     chain of command and to their ECs down the chain as well.

     i would like to know about any and all FidoNet-related pages out
     there. the only way i can get that info after little response to
     FidoNews requests is to send you and your downlinks this Netmail.

     for example, i have a listing for REC19 at ccove that no longer seems
     to exist.  REC19? did you drop or change your webpage?

     Zones 4 and 5 don't have any links at all in the fidonet.org section.
     ZC4 and ZC5, do you have webpages down and over there?

     Latest Greatest Software Versions
     by Peter E. Popovich, 1:363/264

     All right, I admit it. I've been slacking off. I didn't get anything
     done this week. Sigh.

     The good news is that the old info section is down to under 40
     percent, so we're seeing some real progress there.

     Phased out this week: "OS/2 Systems" Section

     Phase-out highlights:
       This week: "Amiga" Section
             Deadline for info: 14 Mar 1997.
       Last week: "Atari ST/TT" Section
             Deadline for info: 7 Mar 1997.
