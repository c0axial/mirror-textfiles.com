                              Death of a Viking
                                  Doug Myers

     I lost a friend this week.  Saturday morning at about 3AM, Phil
     Anderson, known in BBS circles as The Viking, died of heart failure.
     Phil didn't participate much in Fidonet, but I'd like to remember
     him here because he was an integral part of the BBS scene from which
     Fido grew.

     Phil's Viking Board was a fixture in the Harrisburg PA area even
     before Fidonet was introduced by George Peace.  His original board
     was a modest affair run on a Commodore using only floppy disk
     drives.  Though he ran it as "The Viking," he insisted on real names
     from his users feeling that the anonymity of handles led to abuses
     in messaging.  I don't know that I agreed with his viewpoint, but
     his message areas were always filled with conversation from the
     local callers.

     Of course, the BBS moved to better machines as they became
     available, but the nature of the board seemed tied always to the
     personality of The Viking - a persona who had a political opinion on
     just about everything, rumbled through the chat bases like a
     bumbling Hagar the Horrible, and with a Garden set up for his
     Goddesses who delighted in zapping him for his transgressions.

     Though some of the older BBSes in the area grew big with lots of
     networked message bases and tons of files, the Viking Board remained
     the same.  Even in this millennium, he still maintained the original
     collection of Commodore files he'd offered through the decades
     "because no one else does."

     Phil did more than run a BBS, though.  He was active in most of the
     computer groups which once proliferated in the area, and still
     served as President of The Harrisburg Area Computer Group until his
     recent death.  His home was a gathering place for BBSers and other
     computer users, and he always had a pot of coffee on when I dropped
     by :)

     His connection with Fido was brief.  I'd dropped over for coffee and
     the usual bull session one time, and we talked about Fido.  So I set
     him up with a mailer and some batch files to integrate to the TriBBS
     system he was running, had him exchange netmail with the local NC so
     he'd qualify for a node number, and downloaded the Echolist from my
     board so he could select message bases.  But he changed his mind,
     feeling that he didn't want to change the "local" nature of his
     board.

     At that point, I almost agreed with him.  Though I heavily favor
     Fidonet, his BBS was still going strong long after most of the local
     boards had folded.  Why mess with a good thing?

     So Phil's death won't affect Fidonet much, but a little piece of
     BBSing is gone forever...

                              BBS of the Future?
                                  Doug Myers

     Ed Koon advertises Doc's Place, an online BBS, in this issue.
     Though it's not the first BBS accessible through the Internet, the
     advertisement stirs some hope in me.  In introducing the
     advertisement, Ed points out that there's just him and the NEC left
     in the old net.  Unsaid, but implied, is that Doc's Place isn't
     going to fold despite the trend with dial-up BBSes.

     It doesn't take a mental giant to figure out that the combination of
     Internet access and the availability of much more sophisticated
     computers has outmoded the traditional dial-up BBS.  And it's not
     unjustified - the range of abilities to a user on the Web is much
     greater than ever dreamed with any BBS.  But, in this exodus to the
     Web, there seems to be something missing...

     It's hard to define, but let me take a stab.  When BBSing was at
     it's peak, I could log onto fifty-two boards within my local calling
     area.  While quality varied, each of these BBSes was an individual
     community.  With the Web, I suppose there is some kind of community,
     but it's a world-wide community... not at all like the limitless
     variety possible with individual sysops creating their own little
     world.

     What may have been the strength of BBSing was that one didn't need
     to be a SERIOUS PLAYER to set up a board.  All it took was enough
     money to afford a phone line (though some of the young folks avoided
     this and used the family line... usually with disastrous results),
     and the computer you were using to call out anyway.  In the past,
     the Internet was only for SERIOUS PLAYERS - the costs of setting up
     an operation on the Web other than a simple home page pretty much
     ruled out hobbyists.

     But have we progressed to a time when an individual hobbyist can
     connect his computer to the Web full time?  Can we capture the
     seeming endless variety of the BBS scene once again?

     This one is a heart-felt reminder...  to remind us all to appreciate
     those we have in our lives, and the power of love and of our own
     special guardian angels!  I needed to share this with all fido
     friends. Perhaps it will atone to some degree for my temper at at
     times.

                                 RUDY'S ANGEL

     | walked into the grocery store not particularly interested in
     buying groceries. I wasn't hungry. The pain of losing my husband of
     37 years was still too raw. And this grocery store held so many
     sweet memories. Rudy often came with me and almost every time he'd
     pretend to go off and look for something special. I knew what he was
     up to.  I'd always spot him walking down the aisle with the three
     yellow roses in his hands. Rudy knew I loved yellow roses.

     With a heart filled with grief, I only wanted to buy my few items
     and leave, but even grocery shopping was different since Rudy had
     passed on. Shopping for one took time, a little more thought than it
     had for two.

     Standing by the meat, I searched for the perfect small steak and
     remembered how Rudy had loved his steak. Suddenly a woman came up
     beside me. She was blond, slim and lovely in a soft green pantsuit.
     I watched as she picked up a large pack of T-bones, dropped them in
     her basket, hesitated, and then put them back. She turned to go and
     once again reached for the pack of steaks.

     She saw me watching her and she smiled. "My husband loves T-bones,
     but honestly, at these prices, I don't know."

     I swallowed the emotion down my throat and met her pale blue eyes.
     "My husband passed away eight days ago," I told her. Glancing at the
     package in her hands, I fought to control the tremble in my voice.
     "Buy him the steaks. And cherish every moment you have together."

     She shook her head and I saw the emotion in her eyes as she placed
     the package in her basket and wheeled away. I turned and pushed my
     cart across the length of the store to the dairy products. There I
     stood, trying to decide which size milk I should buy.  A quart, I
     finally decided and moved on to the ice cream section near the front
     of the store. If nothing else, I could always fix myself an ice
     cream cone.

     I placed the ice cream in my cart and looked down the aisle toward
     the front.  I saw first the green suit, then recognized the pretty
     lady coming towards me. In her arms she carried a package. On her
     face was the brightest smile I had ever seen. I would swear a soft
     FIDONEWS 17-33               Page 4                   14 Aug 2000


     halo encircled her blond hair as she kept walking toward me, her
     eyes holding mine.

     As she came closer, I saw what she held and tears began misting in
     my eyes.  "These are for you," she said and placed three beautiful
     long stemmed yellow roses in my arms. "When you go through the line,
     they will know these are paid for." She leaned over and placed a
     gentle kiss on my cheek, then smiled again. I wanted to tell her
     what she'd done, what the roses meant,  but still unable to speak, I
     watched as she walked away as tears clouded my vision.

     I looked down at the beautiful roses nestled in the green tissue
     wrapping and found it almost unreal. How did she know?

     Suddenly the answer seemed so clear. I wasn't alone. "Oh, Rudy, you
     haven't forgotten me, have you?" I whispered, with tears in my eyes.
     He was still with me, and she was his angel.

                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Everyday be thankful for what you have and who you are, because you
     all are precious to someone, and when anger next raises it's ugly
     head, remember love is a most healing thing... if we apply it to our
     wounds.

                              Tiger in the Dark
                              Thanks to Roy Reed

     Stevie Wonder and Tiger Woods are in a bar.  Woods turns to Wonder
     and says: How is the singing career going?"

     Stevie Wonder replies: "Not too bad! How's the golf?"

     Woods replies: "Not too bad, I've had some problems with my swing,
     but I think I've got that right now."

     Stevie Wonder says: "I always find that when my swing goes wrong, I
     need to stop playing for a while and not think about it.  Then, the
     next time I play, it seems to be all right.

     Tiger Woods says: "You play golf?"

     Stevie Wonder says: "Oh, yes, I've been playing for years."

     And Woods says: "But, you're blind.  How can you play golf if you're
     blind?"

     Wonder replies: "I get my caddy to stand in the middle of the
     fairway and call to me.  I listen for the sound of his voice and
     play the ball towards him.  Then, when I get to where the ball
     lands, the caddy moves to the green or farther down the fairway and
     again I play the ball towards his voice."

     "But, how do you putt?", asks Woods.

     "Well," says Stevie, "I get my caddy to lean down in front of the
     hole and call to me with his head on the ground and I just play the
     ball towards his voice."

     Woods asks: "What's your handicap?"

     Stevie says, "Well, I'm a scratch golfer."

     Woods, incredulous, says to Stevie: "We've got to play a round
     sometime."

     Wonder replies: "Well, people don't take me seriously, so I only
     play for money, and never play for less than $10,000 a hole."

     Woods thinks about it and says, "OK, I'm game for that, when would
     you like to play?"

     Stevie says, "Pick a night!"

     a @ preceding an individual's name implies a virtual email
     address. The email is translated as follows
     firstlast@osirusoft.com will automatically route to the
     appropriate individual's email.  Anyone in this list will
     also receive routed notice of this feature.  In my case, it
     would still be joejared@osirusoft.com, but you get the idea.

     Also, as information is provided to me, I will be adding a
     latency field to each node, which is defined as the maximum
     time between when the message is received, and when it is
     sent on to other nodes, or available to be sent onward,
     defined in minutes. A latency of ! implies that there is an
     immediate response, and an attempt to deliver immediately
     after processing, or a "MinuteMail System", as it were.
