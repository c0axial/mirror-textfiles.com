        I'm late again ...

        Since I'm on the subject, anyone want to take over
this job? I have way too much to do to keep up the
newsletter, obviously I'm always late.

        The requirements are: write this damn editorial
every week, take in all article submissions, and massage
them as necessary, assemble the newsletter and distribute to
a number of Fidos so that the world can get at it.

        I'll supply the software I use to assemble it. This
includes a text formatter, and a program that can convert
fixed ASCII text into word wrapped format. You will need
WordStar or preferably PMATE or Vedit.

        If you want to volunteer, please let me know,
preferably a week before the 1st or 15th of the month, so
you'll have time to figure it all out. (Its not that hard.)

             ARTICLE SUBMISSION

        All articles you see in this issue are written by
users and sysops, and have one way or another managed to
consume disk space on Fido #1. In order to get rid of them,
and free up my precious disk space, I include them here,
then quickly delete them. Then they are YOUR problem.

EDITORIAL CONTENT:

        Totally up to you; I publish anything at all.
Article are generally Fido or BBS related; this is by no
means a decision on my part, nor a requirement.

FOR SALE, WANTED, NOTICES:

        Pretty much self explanatory. Commercial ads are
welcomed, if of reasonable length. These will be run each
issue, or until I lose them. (Dont laugh, Ive already lost a
few.)

SUBMITTING AN ARTICLE:

        Manage to get a copy of your article to Fido #1,
preferably by Fidonet mail, or by uploading. If manual
upload, please put it in the MAILFILE area, so that I can
find them all at once.

ARTICLE FORMAT: VERY IMPORTANT! PLEASE READ!

        The requirements are a little tighter in this
department, due to purely practical constraints. I cannot
devote hours to converting every text format in the world to
the one I use.

1.      NO LEFT MARGINS! Flush left please. These are
        extremely difficult to remove. 

2.      RIGHT MARGIN AT COLUMN 60 OR LESS! Less is OK,
        more is definitely not. This includes fancy 
        boxes, dotted lines, etc.

3.      KEEP FUNNY CONTROL CHARACTERS TO A MINIMUM!
        This includes formfeeds and other oddities.
        These areent as dificult to handle, but on long
        files still takes a while.

4.      WORDSTAR IS FINE IF THERE ARE NO LEFT MARGINS!

5.      PLAIN ASCII (EDLIN, ED, etc) IS FINE IF LINE LENGTH
        IS UNDER 60 COLUMNS!

6.      NO GRAPHIC CHARACTERS! Believe it or not, not every
        one in the world has an IBM PC. My computer 
        understands printable characters from 20 hex to







fidonews     --           06 Mar 85  20:11:11           Page 4

        7e hex. (Space to tilde) This is ASCII; "American 
        Standard Code for Information Interchange". We are
        "Interchanging Information". Everything else is 
        GARBAGE. ASCII is universal; Graphics are not.

7.      TOTAL ARTICLE LENGTH: Up to you; note, however, that
        I will probably avoid publishing dictionaries, 
        bibles translated into NAPLPS, and ASCII encoded
        LANDSAT pictures of Russian wheat farms.

8.      WHERE ON EARTH IS THIS ARTICLE FROM? Well ... good
        question! A good idea to identify yourself
        somewhere, unless you wish to remain anonymous. 
        Thats OK too, but I may balk at publishing rude 
        or otherwise racy submissions.

9.      AN EXAMPLE:

Article from Tom Jennings
Fido #1 4 Feb 85

        Here is what an article could look like for
submission. Very simple: plain old dumb ASCII, WordStar,
PMATE, Vedit, or whatever. WordStar Document mode is fine.
Note no left column; that is done when FidoNews is
published. Note the total width is only 60 columns; it looks
narrow on your screen, but fine when formatted later.


        END irrational tirade on text files ... on to bigger
and better things!

Having already set up over 9 FIDO systems on the Sanyo 555 
series computers, it seemed natural I should write an 
article on the trials and tribulations of doing so. (Also 
Tom Jennings requested I write this!).
A little backround if I may. We are Sanyo dealers and as 
such have more than just a users knowledge of the machine, 
and it's inner workings.
There are two ways to get FIDO up and running on the Sanyo 
computer. I present them here for your choice.

1) Call a FIDO that keeps the raw files needed to start up a 
FIDO on the SANYO, download them, plus the manual, and then 
read the manual and attempt to get the system up and 
running. (sounds familiar doesn't it ?)

2) Call our FIDO at 914-352-6801 from 6 pm to 9 am (EST) and
download 4 library files. Run Lu.exe against them. Then run 
a simple .bat file and Viola' you have it made. I know, you 
are saying there is no difference ! The difference is I have 
taken the time and the trouble to set up an actual FIDO with 
nodelist, routelist, and mini-user list, as well as 3 areas 
pre-set and ready to go!!! When you download our files you 
can be up and running in less than a half hour, as all the 
hard work has been done. We include a seperate manual that 
describes in detail all the important commands and what they 
do in regards to getting up fast and running. (I wish I 
could have downloaded this type of file setup !)

In an attempt to help those who have chosen the first option 
let's discuss some of the problems that crop up when 
attempting to run from a fresh start.
The first is getting FIDO set up with all the sub-
directories needed on the proper disks. If you don't use 
sub-directories, then you may hbe asking for problems. To 
make a sub-directory called TEST, from the disk prompt you 
will type: MKDIR TEST  The disk will spin and if you pull a 
DIR you will see an entry similar to  TEST  <DIR>
This means there is now a SEPERATE area on the disk that can 
hold files and is called TEST. To get to it, again from the 
disk prompt type  CHDIR \TEST  the \ is very important. If 
you don't type it, you won't change directories. Now type 
again DIR and see what a sub-directory looks like. Except 
for the first 2 funny entries, it looks the same as any 







fidonews     --           06 Mar 85  20:11:27           Page 6

other directory. The first 2 entries are required by the DOS 
and need not concern you at this point.
Basically what you want to do is create multiple directories 
on your disks to seperate the files being stored and also 
for protection, ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE A HARD DISK DRIVE. If 
you are using a hard drive I SUGGEST YOU DO NOT KEEP A COPY 
OF FORMAT OR FDISK ON THE HARD DRIVE...ANYWHERE !!!!!!!!
To try and simplify what we are trying to set up please 
examine the little diagram below.(excuse the art work 
please).


DISK DIRECTORY MAP - VALID FOR FLOPPY OR HARD DISK SYSTEMS
EACH DIRECTORY LEVEL IS SEPERATED BY DASHES (-----).

ROOT DIRECTORY CONTAINS COMMAND.COM AND SYSTEM FILES
-----------------------------------------------------------
FIDO DIRECTORY CONTAINS ALL SYSTEM FILES NEEDED BY FIDO
-----------------------------------------------------------
     :                   :                   :
     :                   :                   :
MAIL DIRECTORY         ANSWERS DIRECTORY    GENERAL
will hold all files    will hold all files  holds all files
dealing with FIDO      dealing with SYSOP   in general area
mail and msg's.        questions/answers    

In the above map the last 3 directories are all SUB-
DIRECTORIES of the FIDO directory. This keeps all files 
pertaining to FIDO in one area, and makes accessing them 
much faster. The ROOT directory is the area that appears 
when you first power up your machine and is the default area 
that the computer uses. PLEASE READ THIS NEXT PART VERY 
CAREFULLY IF YOU ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH SUB-DIRECTORIES !!

1) FIRST---in emergency typing CD\ will return you to the 
root directory..so if you get lost that's the way to get 
back to the area you are most familiar with.

2) To create the FIDO directory from the prompt type
   MKDIR FIDO and then CD\FIDO to enter the FIDO area. 
Remember at first a sub-directory is empty so don't worry.

3) Now type MKDIR MAIL   MKDIR ANSWERS   MKDIR GENERAL
   DO NOT TYPE A CD BETWWEN EACH OF THE ABOVE COMMANDS !!

4) NOW TO GET BACK TO THE ROOT DIRECTORY TYPE  CD\ AND 
RETURN.

THE IDEA HERE IS TO SET UP A LOGICAL FILE PATH AND TREE 
STRUCTURE FOR FIDO TO FOLLOW WHEN ACCESSING FILES.

YOU NEVER, NEVER, NEVER WANT TO SET UP FIDO WITH ALL THE 
FILES IN ONE DIRECTORY !! THE ABOVE TYPE STRUCTURE IS THE 
SAFEST ONE AVAILABLE TO A SYSOP. IF YOU HAVE SETUP YOUR 
AUTOEXEC FILE AND YOUR BAT FILE TO RUN FIDO PROPERLY (SEE 
BELOW) AND USE THE ABOVE FILE STRUCTURE I FEEL SAFE IN 
SAYING THAT YOUR IMPORTANT SYSTEM FILES SUCH AS THE USER 







fidonews     --           06 Mar 85  20:11:35           Page 7

FILE AND THE UTILITY PROGRAMS WILL NEVER BE SEEN, CHANGED OR 
VIOLATED BY A CALLER. The best way to set up your batch 
files would be on the order of something like below.

My auto exec file reads as follows:
PWRUPCLK-starts up quadbaord clock for time and date
CD\FIDO - changes over to FIDO directory
STARTBBS.BAT - FIDO BATCH FILE TO START FIDO
CD\AUTOEXEC.BAT -VERY IMPORTANT IF SYSTEM DROPS TO DOS
                 RETURNS TO ROOT FOR AUTO-RESTART.
My STARTBBS.BAT file follows like above:
FIDO_SYO 1/J 128/V ..............
STARTBBS.BAT - if system drops attempts to restart from 
STARTBBS.BAT FILE.

I have had plenty of wise guys try and break the system, but 
to now avail, it just keeps re-starting when it should. I 
also have 3 other commands...but we must keep some 
secrets...

The second most common problem is with modem selection and 
carrier detection. We have now set FIDO up with the 
following modems to run on a SANYO 555.

A)Hayes 300 external modem
B)Hayes 300/1200 external modem
C)Anchor Mark 12 external modem

On modems A & B...you MUST have switch ONE DOWN !!!!!!!!
Contrary to what everyone else says, this is the only way to 
make it answer the phone and handle carrier detect properly 
when running on a SANYO 555 series computer. We have two 
patches available that handle the DTR problem, and they work 
with DS DOS and MS DOS 2.11, so we wont even touch the DTR 
area in the article. Let it suffice to say it works. You can 
call 203-775-4898 to see it running on a Sanyo 555 computer.
We are not sure of who wrote the patches, but we know from 
experience they work very well when run before FIDO_SYO.EXE

Another problem with the SANYO is the clock. Every time the 
disk drives are accessed the clock looses a small amount of 
time. As we know, time is a needed function to run FIDO-net.
There are two answers to this problem:
1)Set your schedule for a longer period of time.
2)Purchase an internal clock board similar to those used on 
IBM PC's and compatibles. Either way, you will soon get an 
idea of how to keep FIDO running on time.

The last problem we will tackle in this article is disk 
space and the conservation of it.
With 2 readily available programs (download free) you can 
solve a multitude of problems, regarding disk space. Any 
files you might want to make available for downloading 
should be either squeezed, or libraried, or BOTH. You can 
take 10 seperate files, and put them into one file thus 
saving you 9 directory entries (hard disk owners attention)
By squeezing them after being put into a library file you 







fidonews     --           06 Mar 85  20:11:43           Page 8

can save anywhere from 10% to 50% of the original file space 
they occupied.

LU.EXE is the program to use when making and un-making (?)
library files. A library file can be recognized by the 
extension on the file name. You end a library file with the 
extension  .LBR  thus signifying a library file. LU.EXE will 
give you instructions on using it. Just type LU by itself 
and you will get a list of the coomands and the command 
format you will want to use to make a library file.

NSQ203.COM is the program you would use to then squeeze the 
files. This program uses a standard formula and can be un-
squeezed by several programs. I keep NUSQ104.COM and 
UNSQ.COM on my hard disk to accomplish this. Use NUSQ104 
first, as it handles 99.5% of squeezed files.

I hope this article has helped you to start to understand 
more about FIDO and starting a FIDO BBS system of your own. 
I would be most interested in feedback regarding this 
article, and all comments are welcome. Please address them 
to SYSOP  FIDO 357.

If enough people wish me to continue, I would be happy to 
continue this article, as there is much more to be said 
about FIDO and SANYO computers.

If you need help, or just want to chat..please feel free to 
call me voice at the number in the article from 9 am to 4 pm
and I will be happy to help you out.

From Sysop Fido 357 Spring Valley, New York
To all Fido Sysops interested in making extra money
========================================================

We are embarking on a NEW venture using the FIDO BBS system
and the US mail service to provide customers with a service 
that while currently available is MUCH more expensive than 
it need be! If you are interested in making extra money 
then read on and see if this idea makes sense to you.
We have many customers who have a need for 2 day mail
service to the West coast, but do not want to pay the 
ridiculous charges other companies feel is needed. We are 
looking for Fido Sysops to participate in a new venture 
that should make us all some money. 

The idea is simple. Any letters I receive by 6 pm (EST) 
will be sent to FIDO systems in the appropriate zip code. 
This should mean that you will receive INCOMING FIDO mail
some time around 3 pm your time from my system. Once the 
transfer has been completed, all YOU have to do is load the 
file into Word Star (or similar) strip off the message 
header, and print out the letter on good paper. Then you 
drop the letter in an envelope WE SUPPLY with POSTAGE,and 
drop it in a local mailbox BEFORE 5 p.m.

What do you make out of this ?We will initially pay each 







fidonews     --           06 Mar 85  20:11:52           Page 9

SYSOP who participates a fee of $2.50 cents to do the above 
FOR EACH AND EVERY LETTER HE MAILS BEFORE 5 PM. We are 
supplying the postage and the envelopes for you to use. All 
you have to supply is the time needed and printer paper.
YOU DO NOT AT ANY TIME HAVE TO PLACE ANY LONG DISTANCE
PHONE CALLS TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PLAN. ALL YOU WILL HAVE 
TO DO IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IS FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS 
BELOW.

If you are interestedin this idea please do the following:

1)Send us a Fido mail letter with the following:

  a) Your name and Fido number.
  b) A list of zip codes in your area that will receive 1st 
and second day delivery if mailed by 5 pm (your time).
  c) A little note telling us your baud rate, and anything 
special you might want to add.

When (if) we get enough participation, we will notify you 
and arrange to send the envelopes and postage. Payment for 
letters mailed will be made once a week by bank check to 
you.
Please let us know if you are interested in this idea.

The purpose of this article is to discuss the merits of
setting up all the FIDOS running on Sanyo in a SEPARATE
time slot for FIDO MAIL.

As most of you know (and those who don't know) FIDO will 
by-pass the ROUTELIST.BBS whenever a file is attached ! 
While this is good for most instances, it does cause a loss 
of time during the NATIONAL MAIL SLOT when a lot of FIDOS 
are sending files, as they DO NOT go to a host, but DIRECT 
to the FIDO you are sending them to !

It would seem that it might be more efficient to set up a 
separate time slot for Sanyo Fidos to transfer files. This 
would free up the individual nodes to be free during 
national mail time, yet allow file transfers also. If you 
are receiving A DECENT SIZED FILE DURING NATIONAL MAIL YOU 
MIGHT MISS SOME INCOMING MAIL (unless you have an inbound).

As more and more Sanyos come on line with FIDO and more and 
more specialized software becomes available for the sanyo 
it might end up making sense to follow through with a 
separate national time slot for sanyo file transfers.

All comments, etc; should be addressed to:

 - SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA NETWORK - (Effective  2 FEB 85) 

        The Southern California Network (SOCALNET), is
comprised of five separate Regional Hubs, covering the major
geographical areas.

          The Southern California Network protocol and
network routing schedule will be implemented by Fido 313,
Mike Hamilton.  Prior to the operation of the network, Mike
will distribute to ALL Regional Hubs the correct routing for
the individual nodes. The individual nodes will then insert
the pertinent data into the NODELIST.DAT with their Local
Area Prefixes, and process with NODELIST.EXE and ROUTGEN.EXE
to create their own ROUTE.xxx. We are doing this to insure
uniformity between nodes.

          FidoNews distribution, both Inbound from Fido 1
and Outbound to the Regional Hubs, will be handled by Fido
331, Brian Casey. 

          Weekly updates for the FIDOLIST and NODELIST will
be provided by Fido 36, and distributed to the Regional Hubs
every Saturday during the Network shedule.  It will be the
responsibility of the individual Local nodes to download the
latest FidoNews, FIDOLIST, NODELIST from their Regional
Hubs.

[ The views stated here are not necessarily those of the
editorial staff ... tj ]

The following is the text of a letter sent to the 
Austin American-Statesman (Austin, TX) in response 
to an editorial concerning military retirement.  The 
editorial stated that "military life is not very 
demanding (execpt in wartime)" ; that "facts are 
facts" and advocated unspecificed cuts in the 
military retirement system.  Since the Statesman 
choose not to run it, I offer it to my fellow fido 
users for your comments:

            *  *  *  *  *  *

     Your editorial on military "pension" reform 
does a disservice to your readers by implying that 
military retirement pay can be cut without cost to 
the taxpayer.   Any cut in military retirement is 
likely to be offset by increased costs in retention, 
or in social unrest caused by return to the draft.  
All surveys show that the present retirement pay 
system is the single most important incentive to 
induce military personel to remain on active duty, 
and new entrants to the military cite the current 
retirement system in the top five reasons for 
joining in the first place.

    The law of supply and demand says that if the 
market lowers the price of a commodity, the supply 
of that commodity will fall.  Reductions in 
retire1ent pay will reduce the number of people 
willing to join or to stay past their first 
enlistment.  Currently only 13 per cent of new 
entrants into the military remain to retire.  A cut 
in retirement will force increased compensation in 
other ways or the nation will be forced to return to 
the draft.

     Your assertion that the the present system has 
"grown like Jack's beanstalk" is completely 
incorrect.  In recent years Congress has imposed 
employment limitations on retirees which reduce the 
value of their retirement.  A change in the formula 
for computing retirement for post-Viet Nam era 
members reduces the value of retirement to future 
retirees significantly.  

     Military retirement should be more generous 
than "the better private-sector plans" because 
military life is much more demanding (even in 
peacetime) than private sector employment.  Despite 
your assertion to the contrary, military life 
imposes many hardships and demands not found in any 
other segment of our society.  Your own newspaper 
recently carried a series on the hardships faced by 
junior enlisted persons stationed in high cost areas 
such as Austin.  Your readers should realize that, 
like all military members, these junior enlisted had 
no alternative but to accept assignment here.  
Failure to report is a serious crime, as discussed 
in "Dear Abby's" columm in the same issue of the 
Statesman as your editorial on retirement.  

     Military members incure many high costs not 
borne by civilians.  They must endure transfers at 
an average of about once every three years.  (I am a 
military member being transfered twice in 1985).  
Well documented studies have shown the member bears 
an out-of-pocket cost of around $1500 for each 
permanent change of station transfer.  Military 
spouses must, in most cases, sacrifice career 
advancement due to these frequent moves.  Many 
military members work in skills not in demand in the 
private sector, such as combat rifleman.  Thus they 
often receive an economic setback when returning to 
civilian life.  Frequent family seperations result 
in high finanical and emotional costs to military 
members.  In the Air Force, two year-long "remote 
tours" are the norm in a 20 year period. 

     Military members must accept strict limitations 
on their conduct, both on and off duty, not required 
in civilain life.  For example, military members can 
be convicted of a felony crime if a no-notice 
urinalysis shows traces of illegal drugs.  No 
civilian employer could impose such a requirement. 
Military members cannot quit their jobs with less 
than six months notice, and most have "service 
commitments" of up to seven years duration.  Thus 
while a civilian can quit rather than accept 
transfer to an undesirable or expensive location,  
most military members do not have that luxury.  

    The 5.7 percent of the defense budget spent on 
retirement helps buy a high quality all volunteer

force.  "Facts are facts", and any discussion of 
military compensation should include a full 
examination of the costs to the taxpayer involved in 
any misguided attempts at "reform".

                          FREEWARE

                 A Morally Bankrupt Concept


Eh? Wazzat mean?  Well, let's think about it for a minute.  

First let's define our terms.  Freeware, as I am using it in 
this context, means software which the author is providing 
to the public in anticipation of support through voluntary 
user contributions.  The concept has a great deal to 
recommend it.  On the one hand, the independant author can 
easily market his wares without having to tool up a whole 
sales and service organization.  The user, on the other 
hand, gets to thoroughly test out a product before 
purchasing it in order to make sure that it performs as 
claimed and that it will fill his needs.  The intended end 
result is that the micro user has available a large quantity 
of low cost, quality software.  Low cost because the author 
has no marketing expenses, and high quality because the 
simplicity of the system encourages all programmers 
(including the best) to make their best work available.

But how is this elegant scheme working out in practice?  Not 
too well, I suspect.  The archetype of freeware (in more 
ways than one) is the famous PC-TALK program.  I personally 
do not know anyone with a PC that does not have a copy of 
PC-TALK.  In fact, many of our clients have us ship them 
updates over phone lines, where they are using PC-TALK to 
handle their end.  But so far as I have been able to 
determine, NOT ONE of these people has ever paid the thirty 
five bucks!

In fact, it gets worse than this.  Attracted by the ease and 
simplicity of the freeware concept, we released a few 
utilities as freeware, with a modest five doller fee.  Not 
long ago I got a call from a man who wanted to know if I 
could make a small enhancement to one of the programs to 
address a minor difference in his hardware.  When I asked if 







fidonews     --           06 Mar 85  20:12:37           Page 16

he had sent us the license fee, he hung up.  Truth to tell, 
I knew that he hadn't, because NOBODY ever sent us the five 
bucks!

Are you using any freeware?  Almost certainly.  Did you pay 
for it?  Almost certainly not.  It's too easy to put off.  
It's too easy to curse at the program and swear that you're 
only using it as a stopgap until you find something better.  
But consider this:  If it's been a few weeks, and you're 
still using it, then pretty obviously it is worth something 
to you.

From: Jon Tara on FIDO #92
Subject: Big hard disks on the AT

     Here's some information for those of you contemplating
putting a big hard disk on the AT controller:
       The AT BIOS has a table of characteristics for 14
different hard drive types.  (There is a 15'th entry, but
it's set to all zeros.  Type "0" means "no hard disk
installed.)
       At power up, the BIOS reads byte 12 of the CMOS RAM
(settable with the diagnostic disk) to determine which kind
of drive to use. Bits 4-7 determine the type for the first
hard disk (C:), bits 0-3 determine the type for the second
hard disk (D:).

     Here are the pre-defined drive types:

  Type   Cyl    Heads  Pre-Comp   Land   Mbyte

   1     306      4      128      305    10.65
   2     615      4      300      615    21.41
   3     615      6      300      615    32.13
   4     940      8      512      940    65.45
   5     940      6      512      940    49.09
   6     615      4      none     615    21.41
   7     462      8      256      511    32.16
   8     733      5      none     733    31.90
   9     900      15     none     901    117.50
   10    820      3      none     820    21.41
   11    855      5      none     855    37.20
   12    855      7      none     855    52.09
   13    306      8      128      319    21.30
   14    733      7      none     319    44.66

     If you want to use a drive that isn't in the table,
there's still a way out: the interrupt 41 and 44 vectors are
set on power-up to point to the ROM table.  These can be
modified to point to your own table in RAM.  (41 is for C:,
44 is for D:). These vectors are used by the BIOS to access
the table.  You would, of course, have to boot up off of a
floppy disk to do this.








fidonews     --           06 Mar 85  20:12:44           Page 17

     By the way, drive type 9 corresponds to the Maxtor 1140
minus a few cylinders (the Maxtor has 918).  S-100 Inc. is
selling the 1140 for $3995.

     Note that you still have a limitation of 32MB built
into DOS (at least in DOS 3.0).  Some people are getting
around this through a scheme that allows more than one DOS
partition, and  maps the additional partitions to D: etc.  I
do not know of a specific software product to do this,
though.  Maxtor is investigating driver software.

     Several theories have been offered as to why the 32MB
limit. In DOS 2.0 it was supposed to be the 12-bit FAT
entries, but that doesn't wash, since you could increase the
cluster size (albiet to an unreasonable value.)  It's been
suggested that it's "in the  driver software."  I'm not sure
what's meant by "the driver software" - it's certainly not
the BIOS, which gets head #, cylinder #, and sector #
(1-17).  32MB is 65535 sectors, so it could simply be some
shorted-sighted code inside of DOS that puts an absolute
sector number in a 16-bit word.  The only place I can
imagine that happening is in the process of getting from
cluster # to head, cyl, sector. Must be some incredibly dumb
code that left-shifts the cluster number in 16 bits to get a
sector #, then divides for head, cyl, sec. That's my theory
anyway.  Then again, it could just be FDISK and FORMAT
protecting us from ourselves...  

     Anyway, it appears to be internal to DOS, and therefore
fixable. (By Microsoft or IBM anyway...)  I am trying to get
a 3.1 to see if that fixes it.  (GM is getting caseloads of
3.1, but the vendor that supplies them doesn't know it...) 
If they DON'T do something about this in 3.1, it's going to
mean lots of trouble once they start selling network
hardware.  Ditto for the rumored 40MB AT.  In all fairness,
there is a practical limit - my PC takes a LONG time to come
up with the "free space" message at the end of DIR.  Also, a
FAT table for a 100MB disk would be about 100K bytes...

     (P.S. The DOS 3.1's shipped to GM were recalled. 
Nobody had the presence of mind to copy the disks.)

FIDO BBS and the Sanyo 550 Series Computer
Second in a series of articles for FidoNews
(C)opyright 1985 by Richard Levey FIDO 357
==============================================

The first part of this article deals with an internal 
problem that the Sanyo computer series has. You may or may 
not have noticed that your clock (TIME$) does not even 
attempt to stay current. To quote a Sanyo technical 
rep,"If the world ran on Sanyo clocks, Christmas would 
come in July".
This problem occurs because EVERY TIME a disk drive is 







fidonews     --           06 Mar 85  20:12:53           Page 18

accessed the clock is SHUT OFF and cannot update itself 
during each access, so the more callers you have the 
slower the clock will run!
There are 3 alternatives to this problem. While number 1 
is a little far fetched, I will mention it anyway.

1) If enough FIDOs start running on Sanyo, maybe T.J. will 
be able to patch the BIOS to handle the clock properly.

2) The simple solution is to purchase an internal clock 
card similar to what the PC's and compatibles have. This 
board is battery powered, and the battery is recharged 
when the computer is running. For the most part all these 
boards use quartz clocks, so maintaining 3 or 4 seconds a 
month should be no problem. A program is provided that you 
enter into your AUTOEXEC.BAT file that will on startup 
poll the clock card and install the proper entries into 
the TIME & DATE prompts you normally would see, thus 
allowing you to forget about entering these items in the 
future. If you need/want more information on these boards 
give my FIDO a call and check out the text download area.

3) Another solution has been presented to me. I do not 
agree with it, but again, I will present it. A sysop has 
managed to add a trimmer capacitor (pot) to the clock 
power line, thus allowing him to change the speed of the 
clock. As outlined above though, you never really know how 
many calls you might get from one day to the next, so how 
do you know where to set the trimmer at?
Also, that addition VOIDS your warranty for sure.

4)Of course you could stay up all night and make sure the 
time stays current, but you would get tired of this !!

The second part of this article deals with the 
different sized disk drives available for the Sanyo 
and their integration into a FIDO BBS system.
You can run a FIDO on any combination of the following 
drive configurations if you follow the directions.

-------------------------------------------------------
*** Not recommended for FIDO bbs. There would be little 
room left for files once you had the entire system on the 
disks.

As you can see, either running DS DOS PLUS from Michtron 
or running the Greywolf operating system you can run any 
combination of mixed size drives including the 800 k 
drives and or a hard disk drive. You MUST be running at 
the bare minimum MS-DOS 2.11 to mix s.s.d.d and d.s.d.d. 
drives !
While we are talking about disk drives let me clarify the 
procedure to create, access, and delete SUB DIRECTORIES.
YES, you can use sub directories on the sanyo. The proper 
procedure is outlined below along with comments.
All input you type is in CAPITAL LETTERS.

a>MKDIR TEST  this creates a sub directory named test.
  type DIR now and see the funny entry that has been 
created with an entry of TEST   <DIR>
  to access this directory type the following:
a>CHDIR \TEST The drive will spin and then the a prompt 
will appear again. Now type DIR and you will see a 
blank directory with 2 empty entries. DO NOT PANIC..all 
is well.
The first 2 entries in any sub directory are used by the 
operating system and do not concern you at this point.
Now type CHDIR \ to return to the regular (root) 
directory. Now type DIR again and viola' all is back to 
normal. To remove a sub directory you must FIRST erase all 
user files in the sub directory and then go back to the 
root directory (CHDIR \) and then type RMDIR TEST.
(For more information on this topic see my first article).

"Can FIDO run in 256k ?" is a frequent question. The 
answer is positively YES, it can. Call 203-775-4898 
(modem) for a demo of FIDO on a 256k sanyo 555-2. It would 
appear that as of version "E" you will have no problem 
running in 256k.

As a Sysop, you know that disk space ia always at a 
premium no matter what size drives you run. The best 
solution for lack of space are the following utilities:

1) LU86.EXE -----------:     All 3 files can
2) NUSQ110.COM --------:-----can be found on most any
3) SQ2.EXE ------------:     IBM BBS system.

The first program allows you to group together many 
programs into one directory entry. This is know as a 
"Library File" and is signified by an extension on a file 
name of .LBR  This program is wonderful when you want to 







fidonews     --           06 Mar 85  20:13:09           Page 20

keep many program of the same type or several modules of 
one complete program all together in one file. This not 
only saves you actual directory entries, but also the 
bytes required for each entry.
Programs 2 and 3 are the real space savers however ! 
Program 3 is a "SQUEEZER" program which will compress any 
type of file, (.BAS .COM .EXE etc;) into a smaller space 
on the disk. You may save as much as 50% of the original 
file size by using this type of program. A "squeezed" file 
CANNOT be run as is. You MUST use an "UN-SQUEEZER" such as 
program number 2 to first make it readable by the 
computer. A squeezed file is signified by the letter "Q" 
in the middle spot of the extension. For example TEST.BAS 
becomes TEST.BQS when squeezed.
For maximum efficiency both the squeeze program and the 
library program can be used together. Here is a typical 
example of the routine used to do this. We want to Library 
and Squeeze the following files.

a) Test.txt    b) Patch.com   c) Run.bas      so we do the 
following:

1) LU86 U EXAMPLE.LBR Test.txt Patch.com Run.bas
   we will be asked how many file entries in this library. 
As a matter of form I always enter 1 more than I am 
actually planning on putting in. This allows for the 
internal file to be created. TYPING LU by itself gives a 
short documentation to be displayed on the screen.
2) The file produced is now on the disk as EXAMPLE.LBR
3) Now type SQ2 EXAMPLE.LBR    the disk will spin and you 
will get a progress report. The finished file will be 
called in this instance EXAMPLE.LQR.
4) You can now erase the 3 files you put in if you want 
and also the .LBR that you created.

I know it sounds like a lot of work, but even those of us 
who run big hard drives squeeze and library files to save 
every bit of space possible.

If you are running 2 floppy drives then you might want to 
consider the following option that is available to you. 
Assuming you have 2 320k drives and are currently running 
MS-DOS 2.11 you might want to purchase DS DOS PLUS. This 
is an operating system that replaces the DOS that Sanyo 
gave you. While we have sold both DS DOS PLUS and the 
Greywolf operating system, our customers seem to be 
happier with  DS DOS PLUS. The principle reason is the 
increase in disk storage space this program allows you to 
obtain, WITH NO HARDWARE MODIFICATION OR PURCHASE. DS DOS 
will allow you to format your 320k drives to 400k per 
drive simply by using their format program and operating 
system. This way you get an extra 80k PER DISK DRIVE to 
allow that little extra in file storage you might want.
DS DOS is 100% compatible with all software produced for 
the Sanyo and also has some nice features built in. You 
may contact Michtron direct in Pontiac Michigan, or check 
with your local dealer, who might have it in stock !

Another frequent question I hear is "How do I get my 
Anchor modem to work with FIDO?" Well we have the answer 
to that one finally ! We have 2 patches available, one for 
DS-DOS and another for MS-DOS that clear up the problem 
the Anchor has built into it. You can download these 
patches from my FIDO at 914-352-6801 from 6 pm to 9 am if 
you desire. Just put them on the Fido disk in drive A and 
put the file name of the patch file in the autoexec.bat 
file you use to start fido.(put it BEFORE the line which 
calls fido please.)

If you do not already have a file called config.sys on 
your fido disk, now is the time to make one. It is simple 
and will benefit your callers immensely. We will now use a 
relatively simply procedure to accomplish this. From the A 
prompt "A>" type  COPY CON CONFIG.SYS and hit return
then type  BUFFERS=30   return
           FILES=10     return
then on the next line type control Z. This closes the file 
and writes it to disk. (by the way COPY CON means..copy 
the console input into the file name specified).
The next time you re-boot the system (reset) this file is 
automatically read by the DOS and the changes made. This 
will allow faster running speeds as the disk does not 
have to be accessed for each and every request, as all 
30 of the buffers you have created will now be filled 
with information.

Well, that is it for now. I hope this article helps you to 
run a more efficient system. Please feel free to call our 
BBS if you have any questions..or problems.

*+*-*+*-*+*-*+*-*+*-*+*-*+*-*+*+*-*+*-*+*-*+*-*+*-*+*-*+*-*
From:     Tom Kenny (User of FIDO #317)
Date:     February 28, 1985
Subject:  Misc...

1. Introduction... I'm new to the world of FIDO and
connect to the net via node #317. I read all of the
existing newsletters and have some questions and comments.

2. Cheaper FidoNet??? I thought the aricles submitted by
Ben Baker (at #10) were very good. There seemed to be some
debate over the cost of an 800 incoming line and to my
understanding the cost would vary according to location.
Central (Midwest) being the cheapest and cost going up the
closer you get to a coast simply because the worst case
long haul gets longer. I wonder if population differences
help in judging the cost. In conclusion the idea sounded
great BUT there was no way around the twit freeloading
problem! I assume outgoing WATS lines are alot more costly
then incoming lines and in my opinion the other proposals

didn't seem as good.... Is it a dead issue?

3. Networks... I'm interested in hearing more about other
networks and inter-network happenings. I at one time heard
there was a FIDO-usenet gateway. Is this true? I'm looking
forward to citadel systems linking into FIDO, anbody else?

4. What's in a name? FUG replacement... How about FIDO
International and Domestic Operators (rather plain I guess)
Is FIDO an acronym for anything to begin with.... How was
the name originally choosen?

5. Newsletter naming convention... The one I favor (for
what it is worth) is FIDOVNN.NWS. The reason I'm not using
two digits for the version number at this time is that it
appears there where two issues of volume 2 number 3. I 
named them FIDO203A.NWS (1/21/85) and FIDO203B.NWS (2/4/85)
otherwise I would have used two digits for the volume
indication.

6. Usenet... In FIDOHIST.TXT which I got off of FIDO #79
Usenet was said to be a mini network with no routing and no
host. I've used this network and was rather confused by
what was meant to be said. First, Usenet is public domain
software that runs on top of a network at this point in
time it is known as the uucp (Unix to Unix copy) network.
Routing exists within both to my understanding and altough
there is no host or shall we say core to the system (which
is the same as FIDO) there are systems that are hubs (again
simular to FIDO). To my understanding FidoNet and the uucp
network are very simular. I did not understand what was
meant by Usenet being a mini network. Can somebody explain?

7. Suggestions... Has anybody thought about pre-paid reply
mail? Say I send a mail item to somebody about something
and I want to really want to get a reply. Well if the 
person I'm sending the reply to doesn't have to foot the
bill maybe I'll get an answer soon or get one where I
wouldn't get one otherwise. One complicated design would
call for some node(s) to play banker.... On the other hand
when node a calls node b and after node a sends all the
it has for node b, node a could request any replies that
are available to node a. The cost would be charged to the
account of the person how sent the mail from node a to
begin with.... I know IF I became the expert on xyz-widgets
and was getting alot of mail from people with questions,
I wouldn't want to pay the bill for educating anybody
interested.... I don't mean to sound nasty, because I'm
always glad to help my fellow user/sysop. It's just a case
where it could get costly on a great network like FidoNet!
This would work easily if there is alot of traffic to that
node but say you are the only user shipping things to that
node, what then? Well how about a required time limit
on the reply? Or that the reciever has to reply! There are
alot of problems I could cite now but let's see what
the opinion is on this one.... Am I the only one that
cares and the only one that would use it? (Remember

                   NOTICES

        As a matter of brief introduction, I am Bill
Macneill, SYSOP of FIDO node #202 in Boston, Massachusetts
(1-617-721-1688).

        Recently, one of the members of my Board (DEC-Line
-- a DEC Micro oriented board) uploaded a game file known as
JETSET.BAS...a jet plane simulator, and one of the great
classic public domain games. The problem with JETSET,
however, is that it is SOOOOOOO SLOWWWWWWW! 

        I would very much like the readers of this
newsletter to advise me as to whether JETSET has been
compiled to operate directly as an 'executable' under the
MSDOS operating environment. If one of you is familiar with
such a file, please advise me where I can obtain a copy...or
even better, why don't you just call and upload to DEC-
Line??  Again, we are at 1-617-721-1688 in Boston....

Item from: Allen Miller, Fido 85, 513-662-9635

I am looking for programs to convert text
files to either all UPPER case or all lower
case.  I have seen a directory listing
showing 2 programs called TO_UPPER.COM and
TO_LOWER.COM.  These names sound like just
what I am looking for.  If you know of this
sort of program, please send me the files or
a message telling me where I can get them.
Thank you.
