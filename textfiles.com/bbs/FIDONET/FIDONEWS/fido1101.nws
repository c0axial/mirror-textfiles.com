                              Editorial
========================================================================
Got a good article in today called "Is the snooze an echo ...". I
must say that I agree with Mr. Perricone.

  Six or seven months back, we decided that we would accept netmail
for articles rather than just files (as specified in artspec). The
main reason was that routing was easier, and we wanted to encourage a
more global participation. That has happened, but we seem to have
gotten into a different rut.

  I am tired of articles that are 90% quotations with the odd "right
on" stuck in. The snooze is for stuff *YOU* write, not for
transcripts of E-mail. For a while anyway, we are going to start
sending stuff that has too many quotations back ... we want things
that are written, not cribbed. Not to say that a quotation will
disqalify an article, but editors get to edit. It is a privilege
gained by doing the work and *we* are tired of excess quotations. ;<)

  It is a biggish issue this week. A lot of articles. There are a
big group of the standard anti-winter, anti-geo, anti-censorship
thingies, but also a few interesting ones on what is happening out
there. More please.

  When I was a kid, one of my favourite books was "The Lion, The
Witch, and the Wardrobe" by C. S. Lewis.  The plot contained a
masterfull image: a wicked witch who caused it to be always winter,
never christmass. Editing can be like that.

Hi, I'm Alan. Hear me speak!
[ ANONYMOUS:  DOES ANYONE KNOW WHO WROTE THIS? ]
Here is my .plan file:

I am a dynamic figure, often seen scaling walls and crushing ice.
I have been known to remodel train stations on my lunch breaks,
making them more efficient in the area of heat retention. I translate
ethnic slurs for Cuban refugees, I write award-winning operas, I
manage time efficiently. Occasionally, I tread water for three days
in a row.

I woo women with my sensuous and godlike trombone playing, I can
pilot bicycles up severe inclines with unflagging speed, and I cook
Thirty-Minute Brownies in twenty minutes. I am an expert in stucco,
a veteran in love, and an outlaw in Peru.

Using only a hoe and a large glass of water, I once single-handedly
defended a small village in the Amazon Basin from a horde of
ferocious army ants. I play bluegrass cello, I was scouted by the
Mets, I am the subject of numerous documentaries. When I'm bored,
I build large suspension bridges in my yard. I enjoy urban hang
gliding. On Wednesdays, after school, I repair electrical appliances

free of charge.

I am an abstract artist, a concrete analyst, and a ruthless bookie.
Critics worldwide swoon over my original line of corduroy evening
wear. I don't perspire. I am a private citizen, yet I receive fan
mail. I have been caller number nine and have won the weekend
passes. Last summer I toured New Jersey with a traveling
centrifugal-force demonstration. I bat .400. My deft floral
arrangements have earned me fame in international botany circles.
Children trust me.

I can hurl tennis rackets at small moving objects with deadly
accuracy. I once read Paradise Lost, Moby Dick, and David Copperfield
in one day and still had time to refurbish an entire dining room
that evening. I know the exact location of every food item in the
supermarket. I have performed covert operations for the CIA. I
sleep once a week; when I do sleep, I sleep in a chair. While on
vacation in Canada, I successfully negotiated with a group of
terrorists who had seized a small bakery. The laws of physics do
not apply to me.

I balance, I weave, I dodge, I frolic, and my bills are all paid.
On weekends, to let off steam, I participate in full-contact origami.
Years ago I discovered the meaning of life but forgot to write it
down. I have made extraordinary four course meals using only a
Mouli and a toaster oven. I breed prizewinning clams. I have won
bullfights in San Juan, cliff-diving competitions in Sri Lanka,
and spelling bees at the Kremlin. I have played Hamlet, I have
performed open-heart surgery, and I have spoken with Elvis.

But I have not yet gone to a Grateful Dead concert.

->Here are both old testament and new testament scriptures that
->document that homosexuality is totally incompatable with
->true Christianity or true Judaism.

Excuse me, Steve, but what does this have to do with Fidonet?  I
wasn't aware that Fidonet had a sexual preference.  Why don't you
take your bigoted antics someplace where they are wanted?  Maybe
you would be interested in joining the fun in the Flame echo?  You
are more than welcome there!

->I encourage anyone deceived into the sewers of homosexuality to
->repent and find a true Acts 2:38 Church.  The sin is fatal, but it
->is not unforgivable.

Could you please point out to me WHERE in the Bible it says that
Acts 2:38 is ANY MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANY OTHER VERSE IN THE BIBLE??
FidoNews 11-01                 Page:  4                    02 Jan 1994

You constantly berate people for not "following" Acts 2:38, as if that
is the only verse in the whole bible that means anything.  Isn't John
3:16 at LEAST as important as Acts 2:38?  Yet all you ever have to
say about John 3:16 is that it's "beautiful".  It's too bad that you've
never learned anything that you preach.  Should I post some of the
"nice" things that you've said about my RC/REC?  Yet they did nothing
against you.  You're one sick puppy, Steve.  When are you going to get
some help?  AFTER you've created another Jonestown or Waco?

Is it correct to force one's beliefs on others?

Is it correct to force one's beliefs on others?
An Article by Dave Blaser
Fido: 1:221/700

Hi guys and gals out there in Fido Land!  How are ya'll today?!  Quite
honestly, I'd much rather be off skiing somewhere.  :)

I was reading FidoNews 10 52 and saw this article by one Steve Winter.
Now, normally, I wouldn't respond to an artivle that I don't really think
is in good taste, or that may offend some, but this kinda struck a note
with me (and let me tell you, it wasn't a good note.. very off key, and
slightly too loud).  Don't worry, this will be a short article and our
regularly scheduled bitching and flaming can continue on as it undoubedly
will.

SW> The Bible is clear regarding the sin of homosexuality.

It may very well be Steve, but that give you no right to stuff your
beliefs down everybody's throat.

SW> Here are both old testament and new testament scriptures that
SW> document that homosexuality is totally incompatable with
SW> true Christianity or true Judaism.

[ ... much snipped ... ]

SW> I hope I've been "exhaustive" enough here with this brief Bible study.
SW> It does seem from these verses that God does have strong feelings
SW> concerning certain matters....

It (God, whatever it may be, and wether or not it actually exists) may very
well have strong feelings about homosexuality, and no doubt that those
feelings are totally against it, but again, this gives you absolutely no
right whatsoever to tell those people who may wish to take part in the act
of Homosexuality that they're completely wrong, and that they've got to
repent to god.  While you do have the "Freedom of Speech" (which, as I
understand it, is in some serious trouble of being revoked) to speak your
mind, you have to realize that homosexuals also have rights and freedoms.
Homosexuals have the Freedom of Speech like you and me.  They have the
Freedom of Religion like you and me.  More importantly, they also have
the Freedom of Expression.  Both Homo and Hetrosexuality can be considered
an expression of who we are.

SW> I encourage anyone deceived into the sewers of homosexuality to
SW> repent and find a true Acts 2:38 Church.  The sin is fatal, but it

Now this is just a nasty little flame to homosexuals.  Chill out and relax
some.. let people do as they will and they'll be much nicer to you.

Figures, the moderator taking sides in a discussion.. time for new blood
in the moderators seat.. someone who isn't so partial mabye.

Replies, Threats, Offers of Absolutions, and, above all else, Flames can
be sent via NetMail and need not be sent through the snooze.  I think
we've taken up enough band-width on this topic.

Is The Snooze An Echo Or A Newsletter?

by Frank Perricone, 1:325/611, VNet 45:560/602, perricone@wsyd.com
Is The Snooze An Echo Or A Newsletter?

Of course we've all grown used to the Snooze becoming a forum for
dissatisfied people to try to ram their ideas down each other's
throats.  But there comes a point when the back-and-forth begins
to resemble a flame echo just a bit too much.  If I wanted to
read a Fidopolitics Debate echo, I would subscribe to one.

Perhaps those of you who are involved in such exchanges could make
an effort to avoid using Echo Format, that is, quoted "opponent"
text set off by your own "arguments"?  It's merely a question of
proper media format.  When in an echo, use echo style; when in a
newsletter, write in newsletter style, that is, write ARTICLES,
pieces of text, argumentative prose designed to establish your
proposition through the use of logic, argument, and evidence.

Perhaps the need to format your ideas in a structured, original
format each time will help cut back on the endless point-by-
point, pointless rhetoric and refine the Snooze into a newsletter
again.  Maybe this could provide a good criteria for rejecting
articles--the Greater Than Sign Quotient (GTSQ) must be below 1%
of all characters in the article.  :)

"Thank You Mr. Archie Bunker"
By Glen Pannicke
SysOp: The Digital Abyss BBS, 1:107/398
       (908) 422-4130
       [14.4Kbps v.32b v.42b]

Dear Mr. Winter,

     Your article in FidoNews Vol.10 No.52 regarding homosexuality and
the Bible is clear in displaying your blatant discrimination and
outright self-righteous ignorance.  I have no idea what relevance
your article has towards issues involving FidoNet.  In fact, it only
adds more fuel to the many bonfires which burn in the good old
"Fight*O*Net". Thank you Mr. Archie Bunker!

     I am not a homosexual.  As a matter of fact, I am 100%
heterosexual.  I am also not your stereotypical "bleeding heart
liberal" either, but your article made me choke.  I cannot believe
you seriously have the gaul to submit this article for publication!
I make FIDONEWS available for on-line viewing on my BBS and I have
received replies from many disturbed users regarding your article.
It is our contention (mine & a few other user's here) that you
gay-bash from behind the sacred shield of religious belief.

Quoting Steve Winters:" I encourage anyone deceived into the sewers
of homosexuality to repent and find a true Acts 2:38 Church.
The sin is fatal, but it is not unforgivable."

     Well Steve, I encorage those who have been deceived into the
sewers of your ignorance to seriously consider focusing on some of
the more virtuous disciplines of the Bible.  I would like to know
if your "true Acts 2:38 Church" is totally devoted to gay-bashing
or is it devoted to the spirit of Christ?  Does your congregation all
wear white sheets to mass?  Do you focus on just homosexuals or do
you employ Equal Opportunity Hatred in your congregation by including
Hispanics, African Americans, Asians, Jews, Muslims, Native
Americans, Taoist-Communist-Bisexual-One-Eyed-VietNam-Veterans too?

     Discrimination in any form is banned on my BBS out of plain old
common courtesy to all.  I guess the HOLY_BIBLE echo is too.  Your
message of ignorance and hatred won't reach here.

Fidonet systems connected to X.25

Good Evening,

Ultinet is the biggest Fidonet-mail network in Israel (about 80
systems all over the country). We are serving more than 2,000 users
with 43 local folders, we are totally free, and we are growing.

Our dream, however, is to serve our users with international Fidonet
echomail (of the backbone). Ofcourse, we want this service to be free
for all, as we are a free net.

Finally, we came to an agreement with a local company, which will give
us an almost unlimited access to the X.25 network, for bringing
international mail to Israel. But the story just begins. We need
someone abroad that carries the mail we want, and that has a
connection to X.25.

If you know about such one, or think you can help us in any way,
please contact me. I can be reached on the Internet
(gaad105@bgumail.bgu.ac.il) or on Fidonet (2:402/400). If you know
about someone else that can help us, please forward her my message, or
tell me about her.

Thank you.

Ultinet Administrative Coordinator

Educating the Unwashed Masses

By Steve Barnes 1:224/150@fidonet.org

Educating the Unwashed Masses
-----------------------------

    My my, the snooze lately has become rather, uhm, anemic lately,
all this talk about censorship & region 25 politics... yawn..

    Back in FNEWS1046, David Slavin @ 2607/203 wrote a brief article
about the experiences he and his other Fido-Entities had regarding
'advertising' FIDO via a flea-market at the local mall. Hats off to
David the rest who donated their time/equipment and expertise.

    That article jives really nicely with something those of us in 224
are attempting. See, I've been a sysop for the past 8 years (!), in
that time, I've seen our hobby change a great deal. Those of us who
were around in the days when a big system had a 1200 baud modem and
two floppies remember what it was like. Brutal! :) But not just the
technology has changed but the callers to the bbs as well. Back then
it wasn't uncommon for a single line system to receive only a handful
of callers per day, but, the level of participation was incredible.
FidoNews 11-01                 Page:  8                    02 Jan 1994

Nowadays, it seems that the overwhelming majority of callers are
dropping in for files or to play a few games and they split. It's that
old 90:10 rule in action. 90% of the activity on any system comes from
10% of the callers. But over the past year or so, its gotten even
worse. Obviously, its not the callers fault, their attracted to a bbs
by promises of gigs of files, online games etc. We as sysops encourage
this type of behaviour. It seems now that were paying the price. The
number of callers on my system is at an all time high, while
participation, or rather contribution is at an all time low.

    In the fall of '93, I was elected as Net-Coordinator for 224.
Besides promising high-paying jobs to all my friends, jetting around
the world at the taxpayers expense... no wait, thats my prime
ministers speech.. I promised I'd see what I could do about attracting
some new callers into our net. The logic being that new callers won't
be attracted, at least initially, by promises of multi-megabytes of
.GIFs. Why, they might even see this as an incredible means of
communications. God forbid!

    So, I contacted our local newspaper about running the numbers of
the local bbs systems. They were more than willing to do this as a
public service announcement. After speaking to the City Editor at some
length, he expressed some interest in doing an article on the local
online community. After which, he backed down. Shoot.

    The newspaper is right across the road from the main branch of the
public library, being in the neighbourhood, I stopped by. Got talkin'
to the system manager their about their online databases.  He
mentioned that they were having an incredible amount of trouble with
people just plain not knowing how to use their computers/modems. BING!
The library has a 300 seat auditorium. I suggested that if they would
loan us the auditorium, I'd arrange a seminar to do an introduction to
modems. Let me tell you, he nearly kissed me on the lips (But I'm wiry
and threatened to crash his system AGAIN :).

    After about a month of meetings we finally secured a date for the
auditorium, arranged for equipment to be brought in etc. I called the
OTHER local newspaper and requested an article, they showed some
interest. With the library involved in the seminar, why, they'd be
downright pleased as punch to do a feature on us. Things were rolling
right along now. The reporter who is writing the article came over for
a brief background introduction the other day. My system carries over
100 echos, none of which are overly technical, mostly public interest
and health related. Two of the echos are WRITING & PROF_WRITER (of
which I'm neither). I showed him these echos and to say that he was
blown away is an understatement. Well, it now isn't a feature anymore,
but a front page article in the Life section, he's coming back over in
a few days with the photographer and to play with my system some more
:-) Originally the article had that hacker/pornography slant to it,
after he *SAW* what the average BBS is really like the standard print
media ignorance was gone. The article is now about the blind girl in a
nearby town whose only contact with the world is through her computer,
or the homemakers in the Crafting and Cooking echos.  Its about the
Canada Chat echo where regular people can express their views
nationally. Its about netmail being cheaper than a stamp and faster
FidoNews 11-01                 Page:  9                    02 Jan 1994

than the post office.  Its about the missing children echo ...

    The library called back the other day with a problem, we
originally estimated that _maybe_ 50-75 people would show up. JUST
THEIR NEEDS is looking like 300+ people. <GULP>. It looks like were
going to be doing a few of these seminars. The response has been
overwhelming to say the least. The article has yet to be published,
were already making plans for at least one more seminar.

    Guys, their is a HUGE number of people out their with modems that
just plain don't have a clue how to use them. I'm not talking about
kids looking for .GIFs, I'm talking about mature people who actually
use their computers for something other than playing DOOM.  These are
people with genuine interests in contacting people about similar
interests and problems.

    That number of people that have volunteered either time, equipment
or expertise is phenomenal. You just have to ask. If nobody is going
to profit financially from this, their more than willing to bend over
backwards to accommodate you.

    If your sick and tired of the same old phantoms pillaging your
system for files or tying up your system playing TradeWars, consider
this article. Donate some time, be creative, have some fun and spread
the word.

I'll write back after the seminar to let you all know how it went.

SimTel Software Repository in FidoNet

...by Paul Boakes, 2:440/14, boakesy@sunrise.infocom.co.uk

Hi Guys,

Just a brief note to let you know that the new files announced at the
infamous SimTel Software Repository are now available in FidoNet by
Tick or file request.

The files that are announced daily into comp.archives.msdos.announce are
now available daily at 2:440/14 to anyone who wants them.  They are
collected daily (Monday thru' Friday) from oak.oakland.edu.

A quick reference list of the file areas available is below.  Typical
traffic for all the areas is around five to six meg per day, although it
has been known to jump as high as 22 meg when a new version of the djgpp

Thoughts of a former sysop
Jay Maynard
jmaynard@oac.hsc.uth.tmc.edu
FidoNews 11-01                 Page: 11                    02 Jan 1994


After reading the latest Snooze and RC25's apologia for forcing
everyone to connect his way, all I can say is...GET A LIFE!!

I was a sysop of an FTN node once. It was #64. Not 1:106/64.0, not
even 106/64, just 64. Back then, life was a lot simpler.

Some of the changes were needed, most notably the fragmentation into
network and node numbers; zones and points were logical extensions.

Others, most notably the way Policy4 is being used to bludgeon folks
into specific means of connecting to the net, are downright silly.

I much prefer the Usenet model: If you want a connection, find one
and go. No policy, no bullshit about only being able to connect to
one specific place, no mandatory politics. Just connect and have fun.
You know...like Fidonet was in the good old days. Before you argue
that finding a connection is tough, I'll comment that I found one,
knowing nothing at all about Usenet, in a couple of days of asking
folks.

Enforcing geonets when folks obviously don't want to do it that way
is nothing more than sheer power addiction. It's trivial to predict
that people will resist, and lo and behold! that's exactly what's
happening.

RC25, what's more important: your ego, or communicating? Get off your
power trip!

What's going on here? (An open letter)

by Erik Ratcliffe (1:109/615.6, 1:109/370.2)
What's going on here? (An open letter)

     Yes, I'm a measly point in a forest of you big ol'
nodes.  I haven't sent money in to become "legit" as a node
myself, and to be honest, I don't plan to.  At least not for
the time being.  In fact, I'm seriously considering how much I
need this network anymore.  Explanation time...

     Let me first state that I'm not someone who is easily
annoyed.  It takes a lot to make me mad, and sometimes even
then I bite my tongue and let it bounce off of me.  It isn't
easy, but usually it's the best policy.  Unfortunately, I'm at
the end of my rope here.  So...

     WHAT THE BLOODY HELL HAS GOTTEN INTO YOU PEOPLE?!  It's
bad enough that I have to deal with attitudes and anal
retentive individuals in the conferences; now I have to deal
with them in Fidonews!  All I ever read here anymore is
bitching and complaining about *C's, censorship, policy,
etc...  Don't you people have ***ANYTHING*** good to say
anymore?!
FidoNews 11-01                 Page: 12                    02 Jan 1994


     Personally, I couldn't give less of a rat's ass if you
want to complain; at least here in the USA (I can't speak for
other countries) freedom of speech is important...  But my
GOD!  You people have ABSOLUTELY ***NOTHING*** good to say
anymore!  Not here, not in the conferences, not ANYWHERE!
Can't you guys submit something NICE every now and then?!

     Here's the bottom line:

     1) If you don't like the network, GET OUT!  (Something
I'm seriously considering myself if things don't change.)

     2) If you do like the network but don't approve of free
speech, de-queue the conferences that offend you and post
Fidonews for FREQing with a PG-13 warning.

     I don't see why this is so hard...  I really don't.  I
would think that a network like this one -- one that has such
a NASTY reputation behind it (and believe me, it's looked at
the same way all over) -- would be putting more effort into
appearing more tolerant to its users and sysops.

     Does anyone honestly believe that freedom of speech is in
jeopardy here?  HONESTLY?!  I didn't think so.  There will
always be someone out there to object to whatever it is you're
doing, no matter what it is; why get bent up over it?  If they
think that the network has turned Rated R, they can leave.

     As for the individuals who argue with these people, let
me congratulate you on being suckered into yet another stupid
argument; the likes of which is becoming typical of this
network.

     Listen closely, children, and learn:

     FREEDOM OF SPEECH IS NOT IN JEOPARDY HERE!  Arguing over
it is a waste of time, a waste of energy, and a waste of a
perfectly good newsletter!  If you want to argue about
Constitutional freedoms, bring up the subject here, then hash
it out in netmail or some other debate oriented conference.

     And remember; if you don't like the direction a
conference is going in, whether it's because the moderator is
censoring your words or because Jerry Falwell decided to
become a user, GET RID OF IT!!!  If enough people eliminate
the conference, guess what kiddies...  It'll DISAPPEAR!  Yes,
that's right!  Without support, a conference collapses!  What
a concept...

     I should write self-help books...

P.S.- Christmas was WONDERFUL!  Thanks for asking...

EMag - Another new electronic magazine?

EMag - Another new electronic magazine?
by Mark Bylok

I had started working on EMag a few months ago, having in mind the
thought that electronic magazines were something rare that very few
people came across.  Releasing the first issue in December had
showed me otherwise.  I had come across four fairly quickly.  It
was encouraging to see others had made this form of media work, and
EMag was original in form and idea as compared to those that I had
seen.

EMag's slogan is "The electronic magazine that's not just
about computers".  What does this mean to the reader?  Well, its
simple.  Although there are articles on computers and electronics,
there are also articles on cars, stereos, politics, and then some
articles that are just for 'interesting reading'.  I try to keep a
variety to attracted different people with different interests.

Users and SysOps can view EMag through a easy to install door.
Issues can be requested on the first of every month and just copied
to the proper directory.  EMag will do the rest, giving the user a
choice of old or new issues they can read.  From the first month
EMag had been out I had received many complements, it seems users
do seem to take the time to read the articles.

Although EMag does have its share of articles, we are always
looking for people to write.  If you think you have a 'talent' in
writing and something to say that someone out there would be
interested in reading, just send it in!  It can be about anything
'legal', but nothing too technical that the majority of users would
not be able to understand.

You can FREQ EMag under the magic name of EMAG from 1:250/808.
That will send you the complete package with EXE files.  After that
time you will only have to FREQ EMAGMONTH for the current issue on
the 1st of every month.  I am sure you will find EMag interesting
and entertaining, so give it a try!

A LISTING OF MACINTOSH ECHOMAIL CONFERENCES (v2.0)

Ralph Merritt
SysOp, The MACnetic BBS
(908)469-4603 14.4 USR DS HST w/V32b, V42b
Fidonet 1:2605/611
America Online: RMerritt
CompuServe: 71222,1330

The following is a listing of known Macintosh-oriented echomail
conferences.  This is certainly not a comprehensive listing, but
it should give an idea of "what's out there".  It is presented
FidoNews 11-01                 Page: 14                    02 Jan 1994

as an information sharing experience; in v1.0, I limited the list
to those echos distributed on a somewhat national/international
basis; in v2.0, I have included MUG-specific, beta-test and other
restricted distribution echos previously excluded.  If you have
any comments, please contact me at 1:2605/611.

My BBS, The MACnetic BBS, has been operating as an informal mail
hub for many of the "non-backbone" areas for a number of years.
There are many additional systems that link to MACnetic and also
hub these non-backbone echos; the major sites are listed below:

Sysop            State    Address      BBS Phone #    Supports
--------------   ------   ----------   -------------  -------------
Ralph Merritt    NJ       1:2605/611   (908)469-4603  14.4 H14/V32b
Louis Oaken      FL       1:135/292    (305)238-2880  16.8 H16/V32b
Raul Almquist    MN       1:282/105    (612)546-2490  14.4 HST/V32b
Richard Bollar   CA       1:125/110    (415)589-5411  14.4 H14/V32b

[NOTE: This distribution channel applies only to the NON-BACKBONE
areas listed below.  Backbone echos are subject to local policies]

While several conferences are non-backbone by moderator choice (for
various reasons, one being a desire freely distribute the echo as
needed, vs. complying with sometimes restrictive regional echomail
policies), this informal distribution network has been helpful in
placing new mac echos on the "official" Fidonet echomail backbone.

Many of these echos are currently distributed on portions of the
Fidonet backbone on an informal basis.  Check with your network
echomail coordinator (NEC) for availability. If you cannot find a
link, please contact one of the sysops above, and we can either
provide a link or refer you to a closer node.

Echos with an asterisk (*) next to their name means they are not
currently hubbed by the MACnetic BBS.

The MACnetic BBS is located in Bridgewater, New Jersey, on Fidonet
node 1:2605/611, (908)469-4603.  The system runs Front Door, Remote
Access and GEcho, with a US Robotics 14.4 HST w/V32b & V42b modem.
The MACnetic BBS supports users, points and Fidonet sysops who have
an interest in Macintosh echos/files, and recently expanded into
Newton MessagePad, Windows 3.1, Windows/NT and OS/2 v2.x topics.

Is Netmail slow or is it me?

CAN I HELP IMPROVE THE SPEED OF LPM NETMAIL?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Are there any speed demons among us?  You bet!

About once a year or so I go on and on about netmail routing.  It's that
time of year again.  I champion netmail routing whenever I get the
chance.  Got some comments on netmail routing speed and all I can say is
that you have yourself to blame!

YOU DON'T USE IT ENOUGH!!

Ask your echomail hauler how often he polls for echomail.  I'll bet
dollars to dougnuts that nine times out of ten it's more than once a
day.

Why? Because of the heavy traffic and the importance people place on it!
Netmail should have more of both!

Read your favorite echomail conferences and see how many personal notes
you find in it that you KNOW should have been sent privately through
netmail to save you the expense of transferring it and bother for
reading it.

ONE personal note and EVERY system in Fidonet has to carry it!
It's a terrible waste and is a pet peeve of mine.

We have echo haulers screaming for cost recovery plans, satellite
dishes, ANYTHING to help with the costs.  As a sysop, you can do your
part by making netmail available!  Easily and readily available.  Put it
on every menu.  Make it part of your bulletins.  Ask your new users to
SWEAR to use it if they want higher access.

We have NC's and Hubs making a phone call to deliver ONE message in the
wee hours of the night.  Most of the cost of that phone call is in the
first minute.  After that, the rate goes down per minute.  It's more
effective if he can deliver THREE messages in that same minute!  (Not
messages the length of mine, though!)

We have routing paths rotting on the vine because of lack of use!

Look.  Every election for ANYTHING gets many candidates.  Even end nodes
volunteer to help out if they can, just for the "glory" of being able to
say that they're a part of the gang.  They don't get used because the

demand is not there!  I say increase the demand and watch service go up
markedly!!

I'm on the border with the New Hampshire network and two others as well.
Can route straight to them with a local call - no need to increase the
traffic on my Hub or NC; who knows, these networks could be long-d calls
to them!  I asked the border node in the network to the south if he'd
handle mail from me going into his network.

"That's what the NC and NEC are for", says he.

No regard for others, no desire to help out.  No consideration that
maybe our NCs are long-d to each other and/or the RC.  No thought that
one local link will make the networks crashable instead of late-night
routing.  But he'll complain about the speed, I bet!

I know the man is technically capable.  Knows what he's doing.  Been
around for a long time, has the space, etc.  I suppose he can't be
bothered for that one message per year.  Can't blame him.

Suppose the traffic was IMPORTANT PERSONAL MAIL that others were relying
on that would cause those others to think kindly of you that you'd get
the mail to them?  Would he reconsider?  Probably.

I dunno.  I agree with those who say netmail routing can be improved.
There _is_ something screwy with it and I really believe it's because
there is no importance placed on it.  There isn't enough traffic to
justify calling it anything other than "Low Priority Mail."  Imagine.
Your important personal mail being called "low priority!"  Can it get
any lower than having to rely on ECHOMAIL to get your message to where
it's going?

THAT'S low.  Next time you post in echomail, please consider netmail.
It'll grease the rails of the network.  Trust me.
