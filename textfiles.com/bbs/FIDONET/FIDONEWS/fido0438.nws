                      NEED CAREER HELP?
                     Want to change jobs?

     CareerPath BBS is a non-commercial, public interest BBS spon-
     sored by Cary Hart Associates; a national Management Consulting
     and Executive Search Firm.

     CareerPath BBS provides a number of free services now and will
     add more in the future.

     1. We provide counseling in resume writing, interview skills and
     career direction via our message base. One of our message areas
     provides for anonymous entry if desirable.

     2. We accept uploads of resumes in complete confidence.

     3. We are interested, in the near future, of providing a CAREERS
     echo. This is dependent upon Network Sysop interest.

     4. We advertise some help wanted. Some of this is via the Metro-
     Forum Echo of net 107. When we place an "ad" in Metro-Forum, we
     typically we do not have an economic interest in filling the
     position. We DO have an economic interest in positions posted on
     the system (non-echoed). However, because we NEVER accept fees
     from candidates, we consider this activity to be non-commercial.

     We need user and network feed-back to make this unique system
     viable and of maximum assistance to all. We operate at 300/1200
     and 2400 bps, 24 hours/7 days.

     You may file request (via FIDO) "INFO.ARC" which provides comp-
     rehensive information about CareerPath as well as the correct
     procedures for uploading resumes. Locally, this file is avail-
     able for download from file area #3.

     Our staff responds to SERIOUS help inquiries within 48 hours!

     David Dodell
     FidoNet 1:1/0 (aka 114/15)


                             New Zone 1 Coordinator (1:1/0)


     Hello,   as  most  of  you  already  know,  I  have  resumed  the
     responsibility of Ben Baker's position  as  Zone  1  Coordinator,
     better  known as 1/0.  I assumed Ben's position last week,  after
     Ben resigned his position in the network due to burnout.

     First, to tell you all about myself.  I am dentist by profession,
     married,  and have two wonderful dogs named  Keesha  and  Max.  I
     live and practice in sunny Scottsdale,  Arizona and have been the
     sysop of the St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center BBS for the
     past two years.

     I am new to this position and will need some  patience  from  the
     network.  I would like to make several comments about my position
     after only being in it for a few days:

     (1) There  might  be a  delay of a day or so initially in getting
         out the  NODEDIFF.  I  expect  to  issue  it  Friday  evening
         initially.  It  will be available by Seadog File Request (aka
         FR) with the file name of NODEDIFF and NODELIST.  FidoNews is
         also available using the FR name  of  FIDONEWS.  Using  these
         "key" words will always give you the most recent issue.

     (2) I  have  received numerous complaints,  policy disagreements,
         etc.  via the grape-vine, Ben Baker, and Ken Kaplan.  First a
         little  patience  is  needed  in  expecting  an answer.  I am
         averaging 15 messages a night so far.  I want  to  give  each
         one my undivided attention, but I also need to devote time to
         my  practice  and  family.  I  VOW  that  I will answer every
         single message,  but please understand that most of them will
         be  routed back as normal netmail,  and may take some time in
         getting to you.

     (3) If you sent Ben a message over the past  month  and  did  not
         receive  a  reply,  please  send  it  again  to  me.  Several
         messages  and  requests  were  lost  in   the   transfer   of
         responsibility.

     (4) FLAMES  will  get you no where.  I will be glad to engage  in
         rational constructive converstation and criticism, but flames
         and name-calling will cause me to think less of any arguments
         or points you are trying to make.

     (5) PLEASE TRY to work  out  problems  within  the  framework  of
         POLICY3.  This  states  that  the  chain  is  to contact your
         network host,  then regional host about any  decision  before
         contacting  me.  If  I  receive  any  mail before it has gone
         through the chain,  it will be immediately be  referred  back
         down without any decision.

     (6) The Help Nodes in Region 1 are being restructure to provide a
         better  support  structure  for the network.  If you have any
         suggestions or comments,  please  let  me  know.  I  am  also
         working  on  getting all the Echomail Backbones listed in the
         Region 1 nodelist,  so everyone will  know  who  their  local
         Echomail  regional  coordinator  is,  in  order to facilitate
         linking of new echos.


     Remember,  to  most of the network,  including myself,  this is a
     hobby.  Try to work out  problems  locally,  compromise  and  the
     network  will  be better for all of us.  Take a deep breath,  and
     have FUN !

     World Of Computers
     Whitestone, New York

     FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  -  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
     ===============================================

     On Sunday October 11, 1987 at the Grand Royal Hotel
     in Hempstead, New York, will be another spectacular
     KGP computer show.

     What makes this show different from ALL other shows
     this year will the introduction of the FIRST PS/2
     compatible computer named the QT/2 which will be
     available at the show for demonstration, evaluation
     and purchase.

     The QT/2 is made entirely in the United States, and
     does not face the import tariff currently being levied
     against other compatibles made in the Far East.

     Standard features of the QT/2 include 3 Megabytes of
     memory on the motherboard, both a 3 1/2 inch floppy
     drive and a 1/4 height standard 360k floppy allowing
     easy transfer of software to/from either format. Both
     serial and parallel ports are included as well as a
     light pen port and a game adaptor port and the display
     adaptor as well.  A 250 watt switching power supply is
     standard with a 300 watt supply available as an option.

     The QT/2 allows hard drives of up to 120 Megabytes to be
     installed and operated as a SINGLE drive without the use
     of device drivers.

     All current CGA, EGA, Monochrome and VGA display units
     will operate on the QT/2. Several  expansion boards have
     been tested and perform to specifications.

     The base price of the unit will be $995. This includes
     3 Megabytes of memory and the two floppy disk drives
     as well as the serial and parallel ports, the game
     adaptor port,  the display adaptor and an enhanced AT
     style tactile touch keyboard.

     The unit is covered by a 12 month warranty and service
     can be obtained nationwide from over 1300 repair centers.

     Kilgore Trout, 1:107/6

                             What's Up at SEA?


     We  thought we'd fill you in on what's cooking at SEA these days.
     First, the bad news.

     The free SEAdog upgrade offer  to  FidoNet  sysops  will  end  on
     October 30th,  1987.  After that date SEAdog upgrades from 4.0 to
     4.1  will  cost  $10.   Just  in  case  you  missed  our  earlier
     announcement about the upgrade offer, we'll repeat it.

     If  you have a copy of SEAdog 4.0 that is now operating as a node
     on FidoNet,  we will upgrade you to  version  4.1  at  no  charge
     (until  October  30th).  To get your free upgrade,  please do the
     following:

      1) Write your name and your network address on your  SEAdog  4.0
         disk label.

      2) Write  your  name and mailing address on an adhesive label or
         on a floppy disk mailer.

      3) Mail them both to us at 21 New Street,  Wayne NJ  07470,  and
         we'll mail you back a 4.1 disk.  We will include a sheet that
         describes what's new in version 4.1 of SEAdog.

     If you wish to upgrade a SEAdog 4.0 that is NOT now operating  as
     a node on FidoNet,  then enclose $10.  If you wish to upgrade any
     earlier version of SEAdog, then enclose $50.


     Now that that's out of the way, what else is going on?

     We've tinkered with the MGM system a bit.  Mostly fine-tuning and
     touchups.  Most of the utilities now make SEAdog log file entries
     at the VERBOSE level.


     ARCmail 1.10 is now available, and is significantly enhanced over
     version 1.00.  We've added an "overflow area" that keeps incoming
     mail archives from blowing  away  your  network  mail  area.  For
     example,  we've noticed that PC-DOS starts getting real slow when
     you have more than about  280  files  in  one  directory  on  our
     system, so now we run ARCmail with a statement like:

         arcmail from all /o150

     This  tells  ARCmail  that  any  time  the  netmail area hits 150
     messages,  everything else goes in the  overflow  area.  We  then
     tell MGMfwd to create 100 messages per pass, and hence never have
     more than 250 message files in the netmail area.

     Messages  that  are  shunted  to  the  overflow area are not lost
     (would we do that to you?) The overflow  area  is  essentially  a
     FidoNews 4-38                Page 6                    5 Oct 1987


     "first in, first out" queue that ARCmail manages for you.

     We've  also  expanded the naming convention in ARCmail 1.10.  The
     convention used  by  earlier  versions  was  only  good  for  ten
     archives  per  day over a span of one week.  Nowadays many sysops
     (including us)  want  to  run  a  mail  relay  event  every  hour
     (sometimes  even  every half hour) with mail events in between to
     deliver  mail  to  nodes  near them.  The older naming convention
     could get you in real trouble doing that,  since you could easily
     create  more than ten archives per day for a given node.  The new
     naming convention is fully backwards compatible,  and is good for
     an archive every minute over a span of a month.


     The  new  SEAlink  driver  with  Overdrive  is now available.  As
     before,  full sources for the driver are provided.  We're  hoping
     that  this  second  release  of  the  SEAlink routines will be as
     popular  as  the  first  was.   For  those  who  can't  wait  for
     Overdrive,  we've  included an upgraded CLINK.EXE protocol driver
     that can now  be  fully  configured  by  command  line  switches,
     including  selecting  the  baud rate,  COM1 or COM2,  and setting
     Overdrive.

     For  the  non-techies  out  there,   "overdrive"  is  an  ACKless
     "streaming mode" that greatly enhances SEAlink throughput on  the
     current  crop  of  9600  baud asymmetrical or half duplex modems,
     like the Courier HST,  the Telebit Trailblazer,  and the Microcom
     AX-9624C.  Overdrive should only be engaged at baud rates greater
     than 2400 bps.


     There is FINALLY a new version of DTTY available,  and  this  one
     even has docs!  That's a big step for DTTY -- we thought she'd be
     a NODOX program forever.  If you've never heard of DTTY, then you
     may  want  to  give  her  a  try.  DTTY  is  a  terminal program,
     something like Minitel and nothing at all like Telix.  Just plain
     ol'  type  at  yer  modem  stuff here;  no fancy menus,  no sound
     effects,  no glitter.  So why bother?  A couple of  reasons.  (1)
     Some  of us actually LIKE plain-Jane terminal programs.  (2) DTTY
     can do SEAlink with Overdrive.  (3) Here's the biggie:  DTTY uses
     the SEAdog configuration and data files, including the node list!
     You can tell DTTY things like:

         dtty call Gee Wong

     and she'll go look up his net address,  find out his phone number
     and baud rate,  and start  dialing.  This  alone  can  make  DTTY
     worthwhile,  even  if  you'd  rather not use her as your terminal
     program.  You can shell out to her from another terminal program,
     have her dial whoever you want to call, and then pop back.

     This version of  DTTY  also  introduces  an  experimental  "split
     screen mode" for those of you who like to chat with  other  users
     on  a multiline TBBS.  Everything except the split screen mode is
     done through DOS calls or FOSSIL calls,  so DTTY should  work  on
     any system that can run SEAdog.

        Are you one of the countless millions who are glad that all
     the hoopla about the Constitution's 200th anniversary is over?
     Or are you one who's interest was piqued by the information that
     was circulating?  If the latter, I suggest you find a copy of
     _Miracle at Philadelphia_.  _Miracle at Philadelphia_ is an
     account of the proceedings of the Constitutional Convention,
     with many quotes but placed in 18th century contexts.  Catherine
     Drinker Bowen tells a good story, and I have read this book over
     and over since I first discovered it seven years ago.

           In the SYSOP echomail there has been a lot of talk of late
     about shrinking the size of the node list.  Ideas such as no
     longer having separate HUB and HOST entries, deletion of private
     nodes, and many other things have been suggested.  All of these
     are good ideas and ought to be considered.  We could split (and
     apparently are splitting) the nodelist into lots of different
     pieces, but that will sacrifice capability.  None of these is
     really a good solution.

        The fact is that there are some 1600 accessible nodes in the
     nodelist, and this number increases every week.  It's not going
     to go away -- and even if all the duplicates were zapped out,
     we'd be right back where we are now in a couple of months.  Just
     think what will happen when someone invents a utility that lets
     non-Fido compatible BBS programs (RBBS-PC or PC-Board) join the
     Matrix and carry echomail conferences.  I'd guess that a large
     number of those systems would join if their favorite software
     let them. I think this will happen pretty soon.

        So, we are looking at expansion in the near future, and the
     uncompressed nodelist is likely to hit 400K or 500K very soon.
     In my opinion the best way to solve it right now is to rewrite
     the nodelist.

        Take a look at a sample entry.

     ,1154,The_Angevin_Empire,San_Mateo_CA,Aaron_Priven,
        1-415-349-2623,1200,XP:,#CM:

        That's pretty long -- 81 bytes, including the end-of-line
     markers.  But if you look at it, not all of that stuff is really
     necessary to be a list of nodes.  One of the first principles of
     FidoNews 4-38                Page 10                   5 Oct 1987


     the Matrix -- I always thought -- is that the purpose of the
     nodelist is to be a list of nodes, and not a BBS list.

        All that is needed in a list of nodes is _how to reach the
     node_.  That means that the name of the BBS is not really
     relevant to the purpose of the nodelist.  It doesn't matter that
     my BBS is called "The Angevin Empire" if all someone in Arkansas
     wants to do is send me a message saying "That was a really
     stupid column!", or ask one of my users about that program he
     wrote. All that person should care about is how to reach me.

        The BBS name isn't the only one that is irrelevant.  The time
     up flags (DA:, WK:, WE:) are only important if a person is going
     to call the board not during the NMH -- and the #CM: flag
     already means 24 hour operation (at least, that is the
     consensus).  And I really don't understand why anybody but the
     programmers should care about extended protocol (the XP: flag).

        I'm not sure about some of the others.  For example, I think
     the sysop-name field might be deleted.  I suppose it can be
     useful to have the sysop's name right at hand when writing a
     note, but it is only rarely that this is really used.  SEAdog
     systems have their USERLISTs, but I wonder how much this is
     really used -- and whether it is really worth burdening the
     entire net with what might well be replaced by the SEAdog sysop
     by a short list of the most common names sent to.

        Some simple things ought to be changed: decimal numbers to hex
     numbers (they save some space), two-digit baud numbers (nobody
     runs at 12 baud, do they?), and CR instead of CR/LF as the end
     of line marker. Those should be simple.

        So instead of the lengthy listing

     ,1154,The_Angevin_Empire,San_Mateo_CA,Aaron_Priven,
        1-415-349-2623,1200,XP:,#CM:

        we would now have

     ,482,San_Mateo_CA,1-415-349-2623,12,#CM:

        That's 41 bytes. Some listings will save more, some less, but
     doing what I've suggested might well cut half of the length of
     the nodelist --without losing any of its capability as a list of
     Matrix nodes.

     Date: Fri 25 Sep 87 03:09
     From: Ben Baker
     To:   Don Daniels
     Subj: Resignation

     For reasons of health,  sanity and marriage,  I must,  with  some
     regret, tender my resignation as IFNA VP - Technical Coordinator,
     and as IFNA Director.

     David   Dodell  (114/15)  was  to  assume  the  role  of  zone  1
     coordinator on October 16.  I have accellerated that schedule and
     entered him as 1/0  in  the  list  to  be  published  later  this
     morning.

     I feel that I have made some significant contributions to the net
     in the past.  For that I am pleased.

     I  feel  that  I  am  contributing little now,  and spending many
     unpleasant hours doing it.  For that I am  displeased!  Worse,  I
     feel  little  urge  to  contribute in the future.  In short,  I'm
     burned out.  It would be a disservice to the net and to myself to
     continue.

     As to the position of VP-TC,  I  have  no  recommendation.  I  am
     confident  that  the  ZC's can keep the net running smooth so you
     need not rush into a posibily bad decision,  just for the sake of
     filling  the  position.  I  suggest  you try to find someone with
     political talent first and  technical  expertise  second,  though
     both are important.

     Respectfully,

                                          Ben Baker

                     FIDOCON V -- WHERE'S IT GONNA BE?

     It seems like we have just barely returned home from FidoCon IV
     and here it is time to start thinking about FidoCon V already.  A
     successful conference of this sort takes a great deal of advance
     planning and coordination.  The Membership Services Committee,
     under the chairmanship of Phil Ardussi, has been charged with
     recommending a site to hold FidoCon in August 1988.

     Would you like to host the next FidoCon in your city?  Here is
     your chance.  Send a proposal to the FidoCon Site Selection
     subcommittee to be considered for the honor of hosting FidoCon V.

     What do you need to do to host FidoCon in your city?  I'm glad
     you asked.  Planning an international conference requires a great
     deal of work on the part of the hosts.  A site must be selected
     with adequate meeting space, accessibility, reasonable price and
     1001 other details.  To give you an idea of what needs to be done
     and to give the Site Selection Subcommittee some information
     about your city, we need to have the following questionnaire
     filled out:

     LOCATION:

          1.   What is the mileage from the airport to the host hotel?

          2.   Is shuttle service furnished by the hotel available to
               and from the hotel and airport?

          3.   Are there direct (no connections) flights from the top
               ten largest metropolitan areas to your airport?

     HOTEL FACILITIES:

          1.   Is there a large (150 person) conference room which
               will be available throughout the conference?

          2.   Are there at least three smaller conference rooms which
               will be available for meetings during the conference?

          3.   Will there be display space for vendors?

          4.   Will there be a small private conference room available
               for the host and other committees?

          5.   Will  the hotel guarantee room rate,  not to exceed $80
               for double occupancy?

          6.   Will the host committee prepare a list including price
               ranges and bill of fare for all hotel restaurants in
               advance of the conference?

          7.   Will the hotel provide early committment on prices of
               banquets, receptions, coffee break service, and any
               other food and beverage service to the conference
               sessions?
     FidoNews 4-38                Page 14                   5 Oct 1987


          8.   Does the hotel have handicap facilities?

     LOCAL SUPPORT:

          1.   There must be an active committee consisting of at
               least five members in the host city at least nine
               months before the conference.  Members of this
               committee should be prepared to spend at least two
               hours per week in the early planning stages and at
               least 8-10 hours per week just before the conference.
               The local chair should work closely with the FidoCon
               subcommittee chair by Net Mail, US Mail, and voice.
               Please furnish the name of the host committee and the
               name and address of the host chairperson.

          2.   Sponsorship of the conference by a local user group
               is okay.  Please furnish the name of the sponsoring
               group, if any.

          3.   Will a list of nearby restaurants (all price ranges --
               including fast food) and local entertainment be
               prepared by the local committee?

          4.   Will maps of the area would be provided to attendees?

          5.   What activities for family members should will be
               planned by the local committee?

          6.   Will there be a software swap area set up with
               computers for people to trade disks?  Will any of them
               be equipped with a printer and/or modem? Will disk
               sales (at cost) be included?

          7.   Will there be conference souvenirs, including but not
               limited to T-shirts and hats, available throughout the
               conference?

          8.   Will a special rate on car rentals be available to
               FidoCon attendees?

     OTHER:

          1.   What other events would you suggest for attendees?

          2.   What are the features of your city that make it
               particularly desirable for hosting FidoCon?

     GENERAL COMMENTS: (To be filled in by the prospective hosts)

     Please give a lot of thought to the amount of time and money that
     will be involved in hosting FidoCon.  Then, write up your
     proposal and send it to us.  We will evaluate all proposals and
     make recommendations to the IFNA Board of Directors.

     Proposals can be sent by NetMail to 128/13, or by US Snail to:
