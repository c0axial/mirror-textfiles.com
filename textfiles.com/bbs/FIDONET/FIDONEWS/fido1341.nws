     Echomail nonsense
     by Lee Kindness, 2:259/7, lkindnes@csl.co.uk

     In response to Bob Moravsik's article/email...

     Well to put it simply someone who is going a bit over the top. Like
     judging a kid before the baby is even born...

     What Steve (Z2EC) posted in Fidonews was his FIRST DRAFT at a new
     echopol, nothing more. It is in force NOWHERE. You might want to
     get a feed for ECHOPOL2 and discuss your concerns in a productive
     manner, a lot of z2 will be able to supply you a feed (along with
     Z1EC).

     Steve has gone thru a couple of drafts now and we are now at a state
     of starting from scratch without the 'poison' of EP1.

     Not that i'm Steve's biggest fan mind...

     While Internet's usenet is weakening, Fido gets stronger!
     by Wouter van Marle, 2:283/317 / wvmarle@medusa.xs4all.nl

     I'd like to contribute to this newsletter. I read it all weeks, and
     well, why not contribute to it...
     As most of the contributers lately, I'm also strongly interested in
     the happenings in Internet and Fidonet. I'm a Fido user for about 2
     1/2 year now, first as a point and since dec'95 I have my own BBS. The
     main goal of the BBS is Fido mail and Internet news and e-mail (using
     uucp and gateways and all that stuff).

     Besides FidoNews, I read some Internet newsletters. The most important
     one is the dutch newsletter Daily Planet, a free newsletter from the
     dutch internet-provider Planet Internet. In this newsletter I read
     terrible stories about usenet.
     Some weeks ago, discussion was made impossible by spammers who were
     posting thousands of messages a day in various newsgroups. This makes
     discussion impossible, which is their intention. This action was
     mostly from Scientology members, against groups discussing their
     church.
     Now there are people active in cancelling (deleting) lots of messages
     posted by others. This is possible in Usenet! Strange, in fact... but
     it is used by some netabusers. They kill all mail posted in some
     newsgroups, another way of breaking down the discussions. This action
     is from (still) unknown origin, and directed agains Muslin, Kurd, and
     other ethnic discussion groups.

     More and more people are complaining about these spammers, but still
     the Internet is growing and growing and growing. It almost gets stuck
     FIDONEWS 13-41               Page 3                    7 Oct 1996


     in it's own flow. At about noon local time, America wakes up. Until
     this time the WWW is usefull, and quite fast. After this time it gets
     slower and slower. But no-one complains, because most modems are still
     slower than the Net itself. And websurfers are used to waiting for
     minutes, click the mouse once, wait for another couple of minutes,
     click again, etc. And it is "great to be on the net, to be using this
     newest technology which has the future". Is it? I don't know.
     I still don't know why people are using the WWW part of Internet for
     entertainment only. I can understand people wanting to use e-mail and
     usenet, but that is a minor part of the Internet users. WWW is in my
     opinion great to find some info if you don't know where to look for
     it.

     Since about a year ago, something strange is happening. I see more and
     more Internet users appearing in Dutch and international echoes. Some
     Dutch internet providers (at least xs4all and bART) link Fido echoes
     to their customers.
     I think it was about a year ago when I found the first Internet users
     in normal Fidonet echoes. The messages are easily to detect: they all
     origin from the same node (2:281/10, the Internet gate of ElCom, a
     Dutch CSO), and the messages are all written to All.
     This also happens with international echoes, I'm linked to the PENPAL
     echo and found an Internet user there, and I suppose there are more
     interenational echoes linked (like ASIAN_LINK, INTERUSER). It takes
     about a week to recieve a foreign reply, but I never hear Internet
     users complain about "slow replies". Usually because they don't link
     to Internet every day... Other (dutch) users of the PENPAL echo
     already started a campain to give the specific user a direct Fido
     link. Benefits: better mail feed and much cheaper. I wonder what will
     happen there...

     Most echoes appear to shrink (ASIAN_LINK shrunk from 300 msgs/d two
     years ago to about 150 msg/d now) but PENPAL is growing! The number of
     messages and the number of active users grew lately a lot. The last
     two weeks about ten new users reported in the echo. Great! And the
     Penpalians are so sweet people! :-)

     There has been much discussion about the benefits of both Internet and
     Fidonet, but I think we should promote Fido more as a (mail-only)
     alternative to Internet. Or, at least, an alternative to newsgroups.
     Most BBS'es don't look that great as most WWW sites, and hopping from
     one BBS to another is not as easy as a mouseclick.
     ANSI based, fast BBS'es, are in my opinion best for our technology. A
     good alternative is the grafical RIP. They are mostly used to find
     some specific info, and all those dreading pictures are not necessary.
     But they are great to download that single driver for your strange
     soundcard from the manufacturers BBS...

     When Internet continues to behave this stupid I think Fidonet CAN have
     a great future. But we have to watch very carefully for users who are
     using computer networks for commercial purposes. We also have to make
     sure netmail is reliable, and fast.  This is not that difficult if
     backbone system sysops keep in touch with each other. Which is also a
     way to make your hobby more fun!

     Looking for Information: Seimens PEB2081 (ISDN S/T Interface)

     Greetings, all.

     I'm spamming the various telecommunications and software
     engineering newsgroups looping for information on this Siemens
     device.  This puppy provides a pretty neat S/T interface which
     feeds into something much like a normal PCM highway except
     that rather than it being a "normal" PCM it's actually one of
     Siemens' own framed protocols, their IOM-2.

     I thought I could easily hack-up various in-house projects
     to make my home computers talk to the outside world a little
     better yet this chip has given me a major headache.  Though
     I've gotten a hang of the IOM-2 interface, I can't get the
     damn chip to linkup.

     Does anyone here have experience with this device?  Application
     notes or pieces of source code would help me greatly.  As it
     is I think I'm dropping C/I commands for activation requests
     onto the right time slot of the PCM/IOM-2 highway and I think
     they're formatted correctly yet I don't get anything out of
     the IPDO output pin -- I should at least see the C/I channel
     offering me the current status of the linkup yet for some reason
     I get a dead flat low.

     Any help anyone can offer is greatly needed.  Because I have
     spammed the world and can miss newsgroups looking for a
     response, a network email response would probably be best.
     I'm willing to sign non-disclosure agreements, by the way, and
     can pay delivery costs for FAXes and such.

     Thanks in advance for any help anyone can offer.

     Progress report on EP2 discussion within Z2
     ===================================

     Well the last 4 weeks if nothing else have certainly been active.
     After the publication of a very basic first draft of EP2, we advanced
     through 3 more drafts, before I paused to take a look at the whole
     situation.

     It has now occurred to me, that we are trying to walk before we can
     run, and everyone was coming up with suggestions, criticisms for
     replacing EP1 which is in force in Z2, and has been for as long as I
     FIDONEWS 13-41               Page 5                    7 Oct 1996


     can remember.

     The whole idea of trying to replace, which general opinion has seemed
     to be that EP1 is a Dinosaur, has been a very emotive one indeed,
     there have been a myriad of views, from "total control" over echomail
     to a very "Minimalist" policy, all through this one theme has become
     apparent, be it minimalist or full the sysops of this Zone do want
     some kind of policy to replace EP1, so we are going to start all over
     again and rewrite it from the bottom upwards, the first stage will be
     just to describe the roles of ?EC chain and the moderators, once we
     have done this, we then have a frame work to build upon for the
     future.

     I noted the comments by Bob Moravsik (1:2606/583), and I will only add
     that I wasn't aware that fidonet went to other planets, I only thought
     it was confined to earth.

     How the final thing will turn out, I have no idea, but at least my
     primary aim has been achieved, we are all talking about it, and we are
     all expressing our views about what should EP should be about.
     Hopefully from this, we can distill a policy which will gain as wide
     as possible acceptance at the very least in Z2, or even perhaps
     network wide.

     I think my Z1 critic described me as a "petty little dictator"?, its
     just a pity he doesn't seem to understand two basic principles
     involved, firstly *I* am not writing policy, it is the nodes that wish
     to take an active part which are, all I am attempting to do, is to
     pull their ideas together into something cohesive.
     Secondly, what we have now, and what we have done, is almost
     certainly not what we will end up with.
     The Zone as a whole will debate, discuss & probably argue until we
     have something solid to work with, this is the whole idea of debate.

     This discussion has been taking place in an echo called "ECHOPOL2", it
     is available all over Z2, and the Z1EC`s system as well.
     Z1EC has been invited to part in this project, because we really would
     like To end up with something like P4, with network-wide acceptance.

     What will we end up with?, what will the future bring?, who knows?, i
     don't, all i do know is that we all feel strongly about it, and we are
     trying to do something about the current situation, and that in itself
     cant be all bad.

     Howdy Christopher!

     In a recent Fidonews you mention something about the use of a GIF
     requiring royalties to Compu$erve now.  As a person who has written
     and released a few programs that deal with GIF files, I tried to
     follow the developments in that area.  What I heard (at various times)
     was as follows:

     1)   All programs using GIFs would have to pay a royalty from
     Compu$erve. This would be $1 per copy sold per program.

     2)   Sysops would have to pay a fee for every GIF stored on their
          systems.

     3)   Only programs that view GIFs would have to pay.

     4)   Only programs that create GIFs would have to pay.

     5)   Only commercial programs that access GIFs would have to pay.

     6)   Only shareware/freeware programs that use GIFs would have to pay.

     7)   It is up to the end user of programs that can access GIFs to send
     in $1 to Compu$erve, but only if they actually use a GIF.

     8)   GIFs are now only available through Compu$erve.  It is illegal to
     make them available for download through a BBS.

     9)   GIFs that are uploaded to Compu$erve may not be uploaded to a
     BBS.  Individuals may privately distribute privately created GIFs, as
     long as they are never uploaded to Compu$erve.

     10)  Compu$erve never had any intention of actually collecting money,
     and the whole thing was just a bunch of wild rumors.

     11)  After seeing the public reaction, Compu$erve started telling
     people the whole thing was just a bunch of wild rumors.

     I'm sure there were others, but those are the ones that I remember.

     What I do know for sure is that I sent a letter to Compu$erve telling
     them I wrote GIF-related programs.  I asked if they wanted me to quit
     writing such programs, pay a fee, or what.  I never got a reply.

         It is a period of system war.  User programs, striking from a
     hidden directory, have won their first victory against the evil
     Administrative Empire. During the battle, User spies managed to steal
     secret source code  to the Empire's ultimate program: the Are-Em Star,
     a privileged root program with enough power to destroy an entire file
     structure.  Pursued by the Empire's sinister audit trail, Princess
     _LPA0: races aboard her shell script, custodian of the stolen listings
     that could save her people, and restore freedom and games to the
     network...

     -------------------------------------------------------------

         As we enter the scene, an Administrative Multiplexer is trying to
     kill a consulate ship.  Many of their signals have gotten through, and
     RS232 decides it's time to fork off a new process before this old
     ship is destroyed.  His companion, 3CPU, is following him only
     because he appears to know where he's going...

         "I'm going to regret this!" cried 3CPU, as he followed RS232
     into the buffer.  RS232 closed the pipes, made the sys call, and their
     process detached itself from the burning shell of the ship.

         The commander of the Administrative Multiplexer was quite pleased
     with the attack. "Another process just forked, sir.  Instructions?"
     asked the lieutenant.  "Hold your fire.  That last power failure
     FIDONEWS 13-41               Page 9                    7 Oct 1996


     must have caused a trap through zero.  It's not using any cpu time, so
     don't waste a signal on it."

         "We can't seem to find the data file anywhere, Lord Vadic."
     "What about that forked process?  It could have been holding the
     channel open, and just pausing.  If any links exist, I want them
     removed or made inaccessible.  Ncheck the entire file system
     'til it's found, and nice it -20 if you have to."

         Meanwhile, in our wandering process... "Are you sure you
     can ptrace this thing without causing a core dump?" queried 3CPU
     to RS232.  This thing's been stripped, and I'm in no mood to try
     and debug it."  The lone process finishes execution, only to find
     our friends dumped on a lonely file system, with the setuid inode
     stored safely in RS232.  Not knowing what else to do, they wandered
     around until the jawas grabbed them.

         Enter our hero, Luke Vaxhacker, who is out to get some
     replacement parts for his uncle. The jawas wanted to sell him 3CPU,
     but 3CPU didn't know how to talk directly to an 11/40 with RSTS, so
     Luke would still needed some sort of interface for 3CPU to connect to.
     "How about this little RS232 unit ?" asked 3CPU. "I've dealt with him
     many times before, and he does an excellent job at keeping his bits
     straight."  Luke was pressed for time, so he took 3CPU's advice, and
     the three left before they could get swapped out.

         However, RS232 is not the type to stay put once you remove
     the retaining screws.  He promptly scurried off into the deserted
     disk space.  "Great!" cried Luke, "Now I've got this little tin box
     with the only link to that file off floating in the free disk space.
     Well, 3CPU, we better go find him before he gets allocated by someone
     else."  The two set off, and finally traced RS232 to the home of
     PDP-1 Kenobi, who was busily trying to run an icheck on the little
     RS unit.  "Is this thing yours?  His indirect addresses are all goofed
     up, and the size is all wrong.  Leave things like this on the loose,
     and you'll wind up with dups everywhere.  However, I think I've got
     him fixed up."

     -------------------------------------------------------------

         Later that evening, after futile attempts to interface RS232 to
     Kenobi's Asteroids cartridge, Luke accidentally crossed the small
     'droid's CXR and Initiate Remote Test (must have been all that Coke
     he'd consumed), and the screen showed a very distressed person
     claiming royal lineage making a plea for help from some General OS/1
     Kenobi.

         "Darn," mumbled Luke.  "I'll never get this Asteroids game worked
     out."

         PDP-1 seemed to think there was some significance to the message
     and a possible threat to Luke's home directory.  If the Administrative
     Empire was indeed tracing this 'droid, it was likely they would more
     than charge for cpu time...

         "We must get that 'droid off this file system," he said after some
     FIDONEWS 13-41               Page 10                   7 Oct 1996


     intervals.  They sped off to warn Luke's kin (taking a `relative'
     path) only to find a vacant directory...

     -------------------------------------------------------------

         After sifting through the overwritten remaining blocks of Luke's
     home directory, Luke and PDP-1 sped away from /owen/lars, across the
     surface of the Winchester riding Luke's flying read/write head.  PDP-1
     had Luke stop at the edge of the cylinder overlooking /usr/spool/uucp.

         "Unix-to-Unix Copy Program," said PDP-1.  "You will never find a
     more wretched hive of bugs and flamers.  We must be cautious."

         As our heroes' process entered /usr/spool/news, it was met by a
     newsgroup of Administrative protection bits.

         "State your UID," commanded their parent process.

         "We're running under /usr/guest," said Luke.  "This is our first
     time on this system."

         "Can I see some temporary privileges, please?"

         "Uh..."

         "This is not the process you are looking for," piped in PDP-1,
     using an obscure bug to momentarily set his effective UID to root.
     "We can go about our business."

         "This isn't the process we want.  You are free to go about your
     business.  MOV along!"

         PDP-1 and Luke made their way through a long and tortuous nodelist
     (cwruecmp!decvax!ucbvax!harpo!ihnss!ihnsc!ihnss!ihps3!stolaf)
     to a dangerous netnode frequented by hackers, and seldom polled by
     Administrative Multiplexers.  As Luke stepped up to the bus, PDP-1
     went in search of a likely file descriptor.  Luke had never seen such
     a collection of weird and exotic device drivers.  Long ones, short
     ones, ones with stacks, EBCDIC converters, and direct binary
     interfaces all were drinking data at the bus.

         "#@{ *&^%^$$#@ ":><?><," transmitted a particularly unstructured
     piece of code.

         "He doesn't like you," decoded his coroutine.

         "Sorry," replied Luke, beginning to backup his partitions.

         "I don't like you either.  I am queued for deletion on 12
     systems."

         "I'll be careful."

         "You'll be reallocated!" concatenated the coroutine.

         "This little routine isn't worth the overhead," said PDP-1 Kenobi,
     FIDONEWS 13-41               Page 11                   7 Oct 1996


     overlaying into Luke's address space.

         "@$%&(&^%&$$@$#@$AV^$gfdfRW$#@!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" encoded the first
     coroutine as it attempted to overload PDP-1's input overvoltage
     protection.  With a unary stroke of his bytesaber, Kenobi unlinked
     the offensive code.

         "I think I've found an I/O device that might suit us."

         "The name's Con Solo," said the hacker next to PDP-1.  "I hear
     you're looking for some relocation."

         "Yes indeed, if it's a fast channel.  We must get off this
     device."

         "Fast channel? The Milliamp Falcon has made the ARPA gate in less
     than twelve nodes!  Why, I've even outrun cancelled messages.  It's
     fast enough for you, old version."

         Our heroes, Luke Vaxhacker and PDP-1 Kenobi made their way to the
     temporary file structure.  When he saw the hardware, Luke exclaimed,
     "What a piece of junk! That's just a paper tape reader!"

     -------------------------------------------------------------

         Luke had grown up on an out of the way terminal cluster whose
     natives spoke only BASIC, but even he could recognize an old ASR-33.

         "It needs an EIA conversion at least," sniffed 3CPU, who was (as
     usual) trying to do several things at once.  Lights flashed in Con
     Solo's eyes as he whirled to face the parallel processor.

         "I've added a few jumpers.  The Milliamp Falcon can run current
     loops around any Administrative TTY fighter.  She's fast enough for
     you."

         "Who's your co-pilot?" asked PDP-1 Kenobi.

         "Two Bacco, here, my Bookie."

         "Odds aren't good," said the brownish lump beside him, and then
     fell silent, or over.  Luke couldn't tell which way was top underneath
     all those leaves.

         Suddenly, RS232 started spacing wildly.  They turned just in time
     to see a write cycle coming down the UNIBUS toward them.
     "Administrative Bus Signals!" shouted Con Solo.  "Let's boot this pop
     stand!  Tooie, set clock fast!"

         "Ok, Con," said Luke.  "You said this crate was fast enough.  Get
     us out of here!"

         "Shut up, kid!  Two Bacco,  prepare to make the jump into system
     space!  I'll try to keep their buffers full."

         As the bookie began to compute the vectors into low core, spurious
     FIDONEWS 13-41               Page 12                   7 Oct 1996


     characters appeared around the Milliamp Falcon.  "They're firing!"
     shouted Luke. "Can't you do something?"

         "Making the jump to system space takes time, kid.  One missed
     cycle and you could come down right in the middle of a pack of stack
     frames!"

         "Three to five we can go now," said the bookie.  Bright chunks of
     position independent code flashed by the cockpit as the Milliamp
     Falcon jumped through the kernel page tables.  As the crew breathed a
     sigh of relief, the bookie started paying off bets.

         "Not bad, for an acoustically coupled network," remarked 3CPU.
     "Though there was a little phase jitter as we changed parity."

     -------------------------------------------------------------

         The story thus far:  Luke, PDP-1 and their 'droids RS232 and 3CPU
     have made good their escape from the Administrative Bus Signals with
     the aid of Con Solo and the bookie, Two Bacco.  The Milliamp Falcon
     hurtles onward through system space.  Meanwhile, on a distant page in
     user space...

         Princess _LPA0: was ushered into the conference room, followed
     closely by Dec Vadic.  "Governor Tarchive," she spat, "I should have
     expected to find you holding Vadics lead.  I recognized your unique
     pattern when I was first brought aboard."  She eyed the 0177545
     tattooed on his header coldly.

         "Charming to the last," Tarchive declared menacingly.  "Vadic,
     have you retrieved any information?"

         "Her resistance to the logic probe is considerable," Vadic rasped.
     "Perhaps we would get faster results if we increased the supply
     voltage..."

         "You've had your chance, Vadic.  Now I would like the princess to
     witness the test that will make this workstation fully operational.
     Today we enable the -r beam option, and we've chosen the princess'
     $HOME of /usr/alderaan as the primary target."

         "No!  You can't!  /usr/alderaan is a public account, with no
     restricted permissions.  We have no backup tapes!  You can't..."

         "Then name the rebel inode!" Tarchive snapped.

         A voice announced over a hidden speaker that they had arrived in
     /usr.

         "1248," she whispered, "They're on /dev/rm3.  Inode 1248,
     /mnt/dantooine."  She turned away.

         Tarchive sighed with satisfaction.  "There, you see, Lord Vadic?
     She can be reasonable.  Proceed with the operation."

         It took several clock ticks for the words to penetrate.  "What!"
     FIDONEWS 13-41               Page 13                   7 Oct 1996


     _LPA0: gasped.

         "/dev/rm3 is not a mounted filesystem," Tarchive explained.  "We
     require a more visible subject to demonstrate the power of the Are-Em
     Star workstation.  We will mount an attack on /mnt/dantooine as soon
     as possible."

         As the princess watched, Tarchive reached over and typed "ls" on a
     nearby terminal.  There was a brief pause, there being only one
     processor on board, and the viewscreen showed, ".: not found."  The
     princess suddenly double-spaced and went off-line.

     -------------------------------------------------------------

         The Milliamp Falcon hurtles on through system space...

         Con Solo finished checking the various control and status
     registers, finally convinced himself that they had lost the Bus
     Signals as they passed the terminator.  As he returned from the I/O
     page, he smelled smoke.  Solo wasn't concerned--the Bookie always got
     a little hot under the collar when he was losing at chess.  In fact,
     RS232 had just executed a particularly clever MOV that had blocked the
     Bookie's data paths.  The Bookie, who had been setting the odds on the
     game, was caught holding all the cards.  A little strange for a chess
     game...

         Across the room, Luke was too busy practicing bit-slice technique
     to notice the commotion.

         "On a word boundary, Luke," said PDP-1. "Don't just hack at it.
     Remember, the Bytesaber is the weapon of the Red-eye Night.  It is
     used to trim offensive lines of code.  Excess handwaving won't get you
     anywhere.  Listen for the Carrier."

         Luke turned back to the drone, which was humming quietly in the
     air next to him.  This time Luke's actions complemented the drone's
     attacks perfectly.

         Con Solo, being an unimaginative hacker, was not impressed.
     "Forget this bit-slicing stuff.  Give me a good ROM blaster any day."

         "~~j~~hhji~~," said Kenobi, with no clear inflection.  He fell
     silent for a few seconds, and reasserted his control.

         "What happened?" asked Luke.

         "Strange," said PDP-1.  "I felt a momentary glitch in the Carrier.
     It's equalized now."

         "We're coming up on user space," called Solo from the CSR.  As
     they cruised safely through stack frames, the emerged in the new
     context only to be bombarded by freeblocks.

         "What the..." gasped Solo.  The screen showed clearly:
     /usr/alderaan: not found "It's the right inode, but it's been cleared!
     Twoie, where's the nearest file?"
     FIDONEWS 13-41               Page 14                   7 Oct 1996


         "3 to 5 there's one..." the Bookie started to say, but was
     interrupted by a bright flash off to the left.

         "Administrative TTY fighters!" shouted Solo.  "A whole DZ of them!
     Where are they coming from?"

         "Can't be far from the host system," said Kenobi.  "They all have
     direct EIA connections."

         As Solo began to give chase, the ship lurched suddenly.  Luke
     noticed the link count was at 3 and climbing rapidly.

         "This is no regular file," murmured Kenobi.  "Look at the ODS
     directory structure ahead!  They seem to have us in a tractor feed."

         "There's no way we'll unlink in time," said Solo.  "We're going
     in."

     -------------------------------------------------------------

         When we last left Luke, the Milliamp Falcon was being pulled down
     to the open collector of the Administrative Are-Em Star Workstation.
     Dec Vadic surveys the relic as Administrative Flunkies search for
     passengers...

         "LS scan shows no one aboard, sir," was the report.  Vadic was
     unconvinced.

         "Send a fully equipped Ncheck squad on board," he said.  "I want
     every inode checked out."  He turned around (secondary channel) and
     stalked off.

         On board the Milliamp Falcon, .Luke was puzzled.  "They just
     walked in, looked around and walked off," he said.  "Why didn't they
     see us?"

         .Con smiled.  "An old munchkin trick," he explained.  "See that
     period in front of your name?"

         .Luke spun around, just in time to see the decimal point.
     "Where'd that come from?" he asked.

         "Spare decimal points lying around from the last time I fixed the
     floating point accelerator," said .Con.  "Handy for smuggling blocks
     across file system boundaries, but I never thought I'd have to use
     them on myself.  They aren't going to be fooled for long, though.
     We'd better figure a way outta here."

     -----------------------------------------
         At this point (.) the dialogue tends to wedge.  Being the editor
     and in total control of the situation, I think it would be best if we
     sort of gronk the next few paragraphs.  For those who care, our heroes
     find themselves in a terminal room of the Workstation, having thrashed
     several Flunkies to get there.  For the rest of you, just keep banging
     the rocks together, guys. --Ed.
     -----------------------------------------
     FIDONEWS 13-41               Page 15                   7 Oct 1996


         "Hold on," said Con.  "It says we have `new mail.'  Is that an
     error?"

         "%SYS-W-NORMAL, Normal, successful completion," said PDP-1.
     "Doesn't look like it.  I've found the inode for the Milliamp Falcon.
     It's locked in kernel data space.  I'll have to slip in and patch the
     reference count, alone."  He disappeared through a nearby entry point.

         Meanwhile, RS232 found a serial port and logged in.  His bell
     started ringing loudly.  "He keeps saying, `She's on line, she's on
     line'," said 3CPU.  "I believe he means Princess _LPA0:.  She's being
     held on one of the privileged levels."

     -----------------------------------------
         Once again, things get sticky, and the dialogue suffers the most
     damage.  After much handwaving and general flaming, they agree to
     rescue her.  They headed for the detention level, posing as Flunkies
     (which is hard for most hackers) claiming that they had trapped the
     Bookie executing an illegal racket.  They reached the block where the
     Princess was locked up and found only two guards in the header. --Ed.
     -----------------------------------------

         "Good day, eh?" said the first guard.

         "How's it goin', eh?" said the other.  "Like, what's that, eh?"

         "Process transfer from block 1138, dev 10/9," said Con.

         "Take off, it is not," said the first guard.  "Nobody told US
     about it, and we're not morons, eh?"

         At this point (.), the Bookie started raving wildly, Con shouted
     "Look out, he's loose!" and they all started blasting ROMs left and
     right.  The guards started to catch on and were about to issue a
     general wakeup when the ROM blasters were turned on them.

         "Quickly, now," said Con.  "What buffer is she in?  It's not going
     to take long for these..."

         The intercom receiver interrupted him, so he took out its firmware
     with a short blast.

         "guys to figure out something is goin' on," he continued.

     -------------------------------------------------------------

         Ok, like, remember we left our heroes in the detention priority
     level?  Well, they're still there...

         Luke quickly located the interface card and followed the cables to
     a sound-proof enclosure.  He lifted the lid and peered at the
     mechanism inside.

         "Aren't you a little slow for ECL?" printed princess _LPA0:.

         "Wha?  Oh, the Docksiders," stammered Luke.  He took off his shoes
     FIDONEWS 13-41               Page 16                   7 Oct 1996


     (for industry) and explained, "I've come relocate you.  I'm Luke
     Vaxhacker."

         Suddenly, forms started bursting around them.  "They've blocked
     the queue!" shouted Solo.  "There's only one return from this stack!"

         "OVER HERE!" printed _LPA0: with overstrikes.  "THROUGH THIS
     LOOPHOLE!"  Luke and the princess disappeared into a nearby feature.

         "Gritch, gritch," mumbled Two Bacco, obviously reluctant to trust
     an Administrative oversight.

         "I don't care how crufty it is!" shouted Con, pushing the Bookie
     toward the crock.  "DPB yourself in there now!"

         With one last blast that reprogrammed two flunkies, Con joined
     them.  The "feature" landed them right in the middle of the garbage
     collection data.  Pieces of data that hadn't been used in weeks
     floated past in a pool of decaying bits.

         "Bletch!" was Con's first comment.  "Bletch, bletch," was his
     second.  The Bookie looked as if he'd just paid a long shot, and the
     odds in this situation weren't much better.

         Luke was polling the garbage when he stumbled upon a book with the
     words "Don't Panic" inscribed in large, friendly letters on the cover.
     "This can't possibly help us now," he said as he tossed the book away.

         The Bookie was about to lay odds on it when Luke suddenly
     disappeared.  He popped up across the pool, shouting, "This is no
     feature! It's a bug!" and promptly vanished again.

         Con and the princess were about to panic() when Luke reappeared.
     "What happened?" they asked in parallel.

         "I don't know," gasped Luke.  "The bug just dissolved
     automagically.  Maybe it hit a breakpoint..."

         "I don't think so," said Con.  "Look how the pool is shrinking.
     I've got a bad feeling about this..."

         The princess was the first to realize what was going on.  "They've
     implemented a new compaction algorithm!" she exclaimed.

         Luke remembered the pipe he had open to 3CPU.  "Shut down garbage
     collection on recursion level 5!" he shouted.

         Back in the control room, RS232 searched the process table for the
     lisp interpreter.  "Hurry," sent 3CPU.  "Hurry, hurry," added his
     other two processors.  RS232 found the interpreter, interrupted it,
     and altered the stack frame they'd fallen into to allow a normal
     return.

     -------------------------------------------------------------

         Meanwhile, PDP-1 made his way deep into the core of the

     Workstation, slipping from context to context, undetected through his
     manipulation of label_t.  Finally, causing a random trap (through
     nofault of his own) he arrived at the inode table.  Activity there was
     always high, but the Spl6 sentries were too secure in their knowledge
     that no user could interrupt them to notice the bug that PDP-1
     carefully introduced.  On a passing iput, he adjusted the device and
     inode numbers, maintaining parity, to free the Milliamp Falcon.  They
     would be long gone before the locked inode was diagnosed...

         Unobserved, he began traversing user structures to find the
     process where the Milliamp Falcon was grounded.  Finding it and
     switching context, he discovered his priority weakened suddenly.
     "That's not very nice,"  was all he could say before the cause of the
     obstruction became clear.

         "I have been pausing a long time, PDP-1 Kenobi," rasped Dec Vadic.
     "We meet again at last.  The circuit has been completed."

         They looped several times, locking byte sabers.  Bit by bit, PDP-1
     appeared to weaken.  The fight had come into the address space of the
     Milliamp Falcon, and provided the .di (diversion?) that allowed Luke
     and the others to reassert control.  Luke paused to watch the
     conflict.

         "If my blade finds its mark," warned Kenobi, "you will be reduced
     to so many bits.  But if you slice me down, I will only gain computing
     power."

         "Your documentation no longer confuses me, old version," growled
     Vadic.  "my Role MASTER now."

         With one stroke, Vadic sliced Kenobi's last word.  Unfortunately,
     the word was still in Kenobi's throat.  The word fell clean in two,
     but Kenobi was nowhere to be found.  Vadic noticed his victim's uid go
     negative, just before he disappeared.  Odd, he thought, since uids
     were unsigned...

         Luke witnessed all this, and had to be dragged into the Milliamp
     Falcon.  Con Solo and Two Bacco maneuvered the Milliamp Falcon out of
     the process, onto the bus and made straight for system space.  3CPU
     and RS232 were idle, for once.  Princess _LPA0: tried to print
     comforting things for him, but Luke was still hung from the loss of
     his friend.  Then, seemingly from nowhere, he thought he heard PDP-1's
     voice say,

         May the carrier be with you."

     Haven't heard anything about Apple CP/M yet. Sigh. I think the
     "throw out the old info section" folks are going to start winning.

     By the way, Dennis McClain-Furmanski, the fellow listed as the
     contact for Apple II software, is no longer nodelisted.

     Phased out this week: GSBBS 3.02

     Phase-out highlights:
       This week: Apple II Software Deadline for info: 18 Oct 1996.
       Last week: Apple CP/M Software Deadline for info: 11 Oct 1996.
