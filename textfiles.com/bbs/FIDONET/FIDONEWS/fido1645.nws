     =================================================================


                         Here's a story, sad but true
                      From Lesley-Dee through me to you
                          About an RC she once knew
                     And his tantrums when he was through

                 Chorus:  Stay away from the Runaround, Mike

                          Lesley-Dee Dylan @1:250/201
                            as told to Doug Myers


     This strange story is, in part, the result of your editor trying to
     get someone from Region 12 to post news on the election there.
     <Sigh>  Everyone was busy trying to get routed netmail working, and
     most considered that exercise to have more intrinsic value than
     trying to keep a demanding Snooze editor silent.

     However, Leslie-Dee did respond, though her responses got lost in
     routed netmail (okay, so maybe they had a point about priorities)!
     Earlier this week, Dee crashed me packets of the goings on in her
     regional echo where the election was being (kinda) conducted.  Her
     effort was unsuccessful, though, in that I couldn't absorb the over
     1 Meg of messages in time to write a comprehensive story.  Just as
     we went to press it occurred to me, however, that Dee had summarized
     the latter part of the election in a post to me telling me why she
     couldn't write the story.

     So the poem at the beginning is to represent the fact that this is
     not a conventional article... more like poetry in motion.  And the
     "as told to..." in the credits is to represent the fact that I
     absolutely did not even ask Dee if I could post her netmail, let
     alone ascribe the story to her.  You'd think I'd learn to stop
     taking liberties with the Chief Super-Bitch, but the rest of the
     story is in her words, though extracted from two different netmail
     messages and edited.

     ---------------
     It begins with Shawn O'Connor posting a test message, responded to
     by Mike O'Connor, followed by Shawn O'Connor's announcement of the
     calling of the election.  When Shawn is called on it, since he
     didn't have the authority to call an election, Mike O'Connor (then
     RC) came in and announced that he had been away on business and had
     to ask Shawn to make the post on his behalf.  But he did have time
     to respond to the test post, just before Shawn posted the
     announcement, and it would have taken only a moment to say - Shawn
     will be posting the election information with my authority.

     The message base continues on through a comedy of errors, and flames
     and attacks, through four ballots, until Mike declares Darrell
     Salter the winner, in a rather farcical debacle.

     There are some real gems in there - look in particular for Steve
     Fredette's campaign poetry - a take off on HMS Pinafore.

     Please make an effort to get something from this to put into the
     Snooze. I am finally starting to recover a bit from this flu, but
     I'm still pretty sick, and I have a lot of other stuff to catch up
     on.  This provides a perfect example of spontaneous human combustion
     of an elflord RC.  It's absolutely classic.

     We were heading into yet another runoff, with an absolute tie
     between Darrell Salter and Steve Fredette, when Steve Fredette
     posted an hilarious message, from the alias of Mike O'Connor Jr.:


     From: Mike O'Connor Jr.                Oct-30-99 11:53:08
     To:   All                              Oct-30-99 15:16:34
     Subj: Runoff election
     ---------------------------------------------------------
     Dad phoned me from the rest home earlier today and asked if I would
     take over the job of returning officer for the election.  He's
     having a hip replaced and can't spare the time right now.  Don't get
     into a panic now, folks.  I don't have nearly as much trouble with
     counting as Uncle Shawn did.

     The 923rd runoff begins on July 14, 2017 at 9:00pm and ends Friday,
     July 21, 2017 at 9:00pm.

        Results to date:

        Darrell Salter          27
        Steve Fredette          27

        17 votes invalidated due to sysops having passed away.

     To:   All                              Nov-04-99 11:14:56
     Subj: My vote
     ---------------------------------------------------------
     Steve just screwed himself.

     I withdraw my vote tallied under the password KillKenny.

     It's truly a sad state of affairs when mail forgery is considered
     funny.

     You are all pathetic.

     Bye.


     From: Mike O'Connor                    Nov-03-99 21:46:44
     To:   Darrell Salter                   Nov-04-99 11:14:56
     Subj: Cheers
     ---------------------------------------------------------
     My condolences on your winning of the R12 election. A package is on

     it's way to your address.

     You've got till Thursday Nov 11 to set things up with the ZC.

     Cheers
     Mike

     ---------------------------------------------------------
     All right people, how many of you actually thought my "Mike O'Connor
     Jr" post was funny?

     [pausing to count show of hands]

     Twelve.  Ok, how many 'got' the joke, but thought it was juvenile,
     and not particularly amusing?

     [counting]

     Seventeen.  (Hmmm... gotta try harder next time.)  Ok, how many
     didn't get the joke at all, and actually believe that the real Mike
     O'Connor Jr (if there  is one) actually teleported himself 18 years
     into the future, moved to Ottawa and posted a message from my
     system, and also doesn't know the difference between an alias and a
     forgery?

     [counting]

     One.

     ...Steve

     MO> You are all pathetic.

     Oh, fuck off, Dad.  Grab a sense of humour.  Drink your geritol and
     shut up. Or it's off to the pasture with you.

     Oh, by the way... the Directeur General des Elections du Quebec
     called again asking about you & uncle Shawn.  The polls indicate
     that the upcoming 17th sovereignty referendum will be very close,
     and they need your 'special skills' again this year.


     ...Your loving son

     ---------------------------------------------------------

     So the result of our fourth ballot in the R12C election was 14 for
     Darrell Salter, and 14 for Steve Fredette, but at the last moment,
     Mike O'Connor withdrew his own vote for Steve, making it 13 for
     Steve, and declared Salter the winner.

     I told you the Reg12 election would be worth covering. :-)

     Ol'WDB: Scientific thinking at its best...


     The following is an actual question given on a University of
     Washington chemistry mid-term.  The answer was so "profound" that
     the professor shared it with colleagues, which is why we now have
     the pleasure of enjoying it.

     Bonus Question: Is Hell exothermic (gives off heat) or endothermic
     (absorbs heat)?

     Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's
     Law, (gas cools when it expands and heats up when it is compressed)
     or some variant.

     One student, however, wrote the following:

     "First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing over time.
     So we need to know the rate at which souls are moving into Hell and
     the rate they are leaving.  I think we can safely assume that once a
     soul gets to Hell, it will not leave; therefore, no souls are
     leaving.

     As for how many souls are entering Hell, lets look at the different
     religions of the world.  Some of these religions state that if you
     are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell.  Since
     FIDONEWS 16-45               Page 9                    8 Nov 1999


     there are more than one of these religions and since people do not
     belong to more than one religion, we can project that all souls go
     to Hell.  With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the
     number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially.

     Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because
     Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in
     Hell to stay constant, the volume of Hell has to expand as souls are
     added.  This allows for two possibilities:

     1.  If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which
     souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will
     increase until all Hell breaks loose.

     2.  Of course, if Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the
     increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will
     drop until Hell freezes over.

     So is it #1 or #2?  If we accept the postulate given to me by Ms.
     Teresa Banyan during my freshman year, "...that it will be a cold
     day in Hell before I go out with you." -- and take into account the
     fact that I still have not succeeded in winning Ms. Banyan's
     affections, then, #2 cannot be true, and thus I am certain Hell is
     exothermic and will not freeze."

     The student received the only "A" on the exam.
