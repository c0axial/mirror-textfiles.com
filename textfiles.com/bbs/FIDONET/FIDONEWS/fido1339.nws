     =================================================================


     This is the LAST FidoNews Issue on this watch to be distributed in the
     LZH format. Next week's Issue will be in a ZIP archive.

     PLEASE UPDATE your batch files NOW!! Don't get caught next week with
     dead-ended file transfers because you put off this adjustment. All
     complaints about being unaware of the changeover will be returned
     unopened. The aggravation you save could be your own. [grin]

     This is also the last Issue to emanate from my Titusville computer
     room. The next one comes from suburban Edgewater_FL. My primary Node
     number also changes on Friday, 27 Sep 96, to 1:18/14. The new phone
     number will be 1-904-409-7040 and should be active no later than 1700
     ET [2100 UTC/GMT] that day. This number already appears for 1:1/23
     but if you try to call it before Friday the 27th, you're going to be
     disappointed. As a result of this changeover, you'd better send your
     submissions for FidoNews 1340 in a day or two early to avoid any
     possible snafus with the phone company that weekend. Use my primary
     Node number of 1:374/14 until then so it gets here.

     In response to some constructive criticism in the FIDONEWS Echo, the
     Masthead Information section has been trimmed down a few lines. The
     overall size of any given Issue of FidoNews is not particularly
     affected by those lines but every little bit helps.

     GOOD NEWS: Zone 3 is NOW updated in the Zone 1 Nodelist!

     There were only two responses to the Question of the Week concerning
     pictures in FidoNews. One for and one against is not much of a
     sampling. There was also concern in the against note that .GIF is now
     a royalty-requiring format by Compu$erve. Is that so? I hope they're
     not holding their breath waiting for the change to start rolling in
     from the millions of Internet webpage users displaying .GIFs by the
     billions. .PNG was suggested. I'm not familiar with that one but I'm
     sure Picture Publisher is. I can convert any format there. Would your
     local batch file choke if it came across a picture file inside the
     weekly FidoNews archive?

     Still awaiting more ASCII art submissions. I'm running out of cows.

     The first day of Autumn is here as I write this. It's raining before a
     'cold' [using the term loosely in FLorida] front gets here. A change
     of seasons for the other changes here. [grin]

     [An early explanation of Coordinators from Sep 85.] Ed.


                          Coordinators List
                       by Ben Baker -- Fido 76

          There has been some confusion about the difference between a
     "network" and a "region." Let me try to shed some light.

          The  network, as we use the term here, is merely a
     formalization of an informal concept that has been around since Fido
     version 7.  Fido has known since then that when told to do so, he
     should send mail addressed to node A to node B instead. The advent of
     "routing" permitted the formation of informal structures known
     variously as "regional nets" or "area nets" or simply "nets." They
     vary a great deal in form and complexity, but they share one thing in
     common. They each have one node defined as "in-bound host" who
     receives the mail for all members.

          We have now given these networks a formal identity. When the node
     list appears in the new format, Fido will know about all the networks,
     who the host of each is, and which nodes are members.  Without being
     told he will automatically send mail for any member to the network
     host. The network number will be part of the identity of every member
     node.

          This was done for several reasons. Many nodes were not taking
     advantage of routing. Now it'll be automatic. It will make it easier
     for private networks (there are several) to interface with the public
     net. Perhaps most important, it permits us to decentralize control of
     FidoNet's only official document, the node list. Because, in the past,
     node numbers had to be unique, one person had to be responsible for
     node list maintenance, a task which has become too big for one unpaid
     volunteer. Now numbers need only be unique within a network.
     Different networks may use the same numbers with no ill effects.

          Thus, network hosts may administer their own node lists and the
     national coordinator merely collects and assembles the pieces into a
     complete node list.

          But  what of the more than 200 independent nodes around the
     country? The region allows us to divide them into ten geographic
     groupings called Regions. A region is a numbered entity much like a
     network, with a coordinator to manage its node list. The only
     difference is that a region has no in-bound host.  Mail to all members
     is sent direct, without routing.

          The file COORD.nnn is a list of all regions and networks and
     their assigned coordinators. Also included is their current network or
     region number which can be followed by a /0 in order to send FidoNet
     Mail.

                        FIDO COORDINATORS LISTING DOC

          All requests for node numbers should contain information as
     explained in the Fido Doc's and be sent via FidoNet Mail to the
     appropriate coordinator. A coordinator can be reached by sending
     FidoNet Mail to his Network or Region # followed by a /0. After you
     read this doc file you can find a listing of current coordinators
     (COORD.NNN) as extracted from NODELIST.NNN. The NNN is the current
     Julian Date.

     If you wish to obtain a node number, but DO NOT want to be a part of
     a network and prefer to be an independent then contact the REGION
     COORDINATOR for your state. Your Region Coordinator is also your
     contact to obtain instructions for application for new networks.

     If you wish to join an existing net contact the NETWORK COORDINATOR
     (listed after the Region Coordinators) that is in your geographical
     area for a node number. The Network Coordinator will give you further
     information as to his geographical coverage and special routing
     instructions for FidoNet Mail.

     Six Mail Processors Reviewed [VI]
     Damian Walker, 2:2502/666

     This is the final article in the six-part review series covering mail
     processors.  This week it is the turn of the Squish echomail
     processor, and following the review of Squish there is a feature table
     and a conclusion to the entire series.

     SQUISH

         Squish is a mail processor for the Squish message base, by Lanius
     Corporation.  The version under test here is 1.11, dated November
     1994, so it is the oldest package under test with the exception of
     GEcho.  I have no idea whether a later version is available (sorry!).

     First Impressions

         You'll have noticed that one of the things I always look at when
     looking at a new piece of software is the quality and quantity of
     documentation, and I'm not about to change my ways now.  Squish comes
     with an impressive 129-page manual with the comprehensive contents,
     tutorial, reference and index sections you would come to expect of a
     commercial quality application.
         Looking at this manual, one of the first things I found about
     Squish is that it's free for non-commercial use.  All of the other
     packages are shareware, although GEcho does have a clause that its
     registration fee and evaluation period applies 'only to those who can
     afford to register'.  Despite its freeware status, Squish is quite an
     impressive application.
         Squish is also limited to the Squish and *.MSG message bases;
     Hudson and JAM are not supported.  If you're a BBS sysop and your BBS
     software doesn't support the Squish (or *.MSG) format, you won't be
     able to use Squish.
         Also of note, is that Squish, like JMail, lacks a full screen
     configuration program.  Its configuration files are ASCII text files
     which you edit using your favourite text editor.  Again like JMail,
     the Squish sample configuration files include plenty in the way of
     comments and explanations, so the manual only needs to be referenced
     if you need to know about a feature in detail.
         Squish comes in four versions: DOS, DOS 32-bit, OS/2 1.x and OS/2
     2.x.  Both the DOS versions appear in a single archive, and the OS/2
     versions also share an archive.  The DOS version comes with DOS/4GW as
     its dos extender.

     On Further Examination...

         Taking a further stroll through the pages of that extensive
     manual, one thing is conspicuous by its absence-- an AreaFix manager.
     I've looked through the document, done various searches, read through
     various sections, and I can find no mention of an internal AreaFix
     manager; it seems that Squish needs an external areafix program in
     FIDONEWS 13-39               Page 7                   23 Sep 1996


     order to allow downlinks to fix in to areas.
         Although Squish cannot deal with messages of unlimited size, it
     does have a facility for allowing the user to configure maximum
     message and buffer sizes.  The largest message which Squish can handle
     is 256k (for the 386 versions) or 63k (for the 16-bit versions).
         One impressive feature of Squish is the facility for one-pass
     tossing and scanning.  Squish can toss and scan simultaneously in a
     single pass, increasing performance beyond that which would be
     suggested by the speed tests given later.  However, only areas into
     which messages are tossed will be scanned, which means that a full
     message scan will still be needed on at least a daily basis.
         A very useful feature, shared only with FMail, is the facility to
     automatically re-address netmail to points when it is incorrectly
     addressed to your own system.  However, the remap feature of Squish
     allows you to re-address netmail to points off other systems, and even
     other nodes!  This could be useful if one of your users has recently
     become a node.
         In the speed tests, performed using the 386 DPMI version, Squish
     performed quite well.  The file used to test all these mail
     processors, a 91-message 50k archive, was tossed into new Squish
     message areas in 11 seconds.  Surprisingly, the same archive was

     Summary

         Aside from its apparent lack of an internal AreaFix manager,
     Squish can be highly recommended because of its speed, its extensive
     documentation and its handling of reasonably large messages.  Oh, and
     let's not forget, its price!
         External AreaFix managers are available, so the lack of an
     internal one is no drawback.  If have no need of JAM or Hudson message
     bases, then this package is ideal.  Since message editors which handle
     Squish message bases are available, Squish could even be considered as
     an option for points, although there is no automatic creation of areas
     when new mail arrives.

         Much of this information came from the documentation of the
     programs.  Also bear in mind the limited time spent examining these
     programs closely.  Pay particular attention to the disclaimer in the
     first article of this series when looking at this table :-)

     CONCLUSION

         The purpose of this article is not to weigh each program up
     against the others and provide a 'best buy.'  It was more to draw your
     attention to _all_ the programs above, and to show that there is life
     beyond the software that your boss node, your uplink, or the majority
     of systems in your net, happen to use.
         Each of the packages has its own merits, and the packages with the
     low feature count each have some excellent feature which makes them
     stand out from the rest, or makes them ideal for your system and your
     way of working.
         If I am to make any recommendation, it would be to take a look at
     the feature table and the articles, and download two (preferably
     three) packages which you like the look of.  Install and play with the
     ones you've downloaded, and _then_ make your decision.  Don't take my
     word as gospel, especially in the 'summary' sections in which I
     speculate as to what situations each package is best for (with
     questionable success and accuracy).

     FEEDBACK

         One last thing-- I would really appreciate feedback about this
     series from anyone who has read it.  Has it been useful?  Awful?
     Interesting?  Accurate?  Boring?  Sensational?  Depressing?
         As you might imagine, installing, examining, testing and writing
     about six packages takes a lot more time and effort than running off a
     few rants, or even a tutorial series.  So I'd like to know if it's
     worth me doing this again.  Maybe I'll go with mailers next time, or
     BBS packages, or even six more mail processors when I get the 'why
     didn't you include this' messages. Let me know what you think.
         The best way to leave feedback is via netmail or as part of your
     own articles in FidoNews itself.  You could try the FidoNews echo, but
     I haven't got access yet.  I may have access by the time you read this
     in five weeks time (all six articles were prepared over a few days
     despite their six week running).

     To: geeks@shorty.com
     From: "Azeem I. Pirani" <pirani@xiber.com>
     Subject: the proper way to take care of diskettes (fwd)


                    Proper Diskette and Care Usage


     (1)  Never leave diskettes in the drive, as the data can leak
          out of the disk and corrode the inner mechanics of the
          drive.  Diskettes should be rolled up and stored in
          pencil holders.


     (2) Diskettes should be cleaned and waxed once a week.
         Microscopic metal particles may be removed by waving a
         powerful magnet over the surface of the disk.  Any
         stubborn metal shavings can be removed with scouring
         powder and steel wool.  When waxing a diskette, make sure
         the surface is even.  This will allow the diskette to
         spin faster, resulting in better access time.


     (3) Do not fold diskettes unless they do not fit into the
         drive.  "Big" Diskettes may be folded and used in
         "Little" drives.


     (4) Never insert a diskette into the drive upside down.  The
         data can fall off the surface of the disk and jam the
         intricate mechanics of the drive.


     (5) Diskettes cannot be backed up by running them through a
         photo copy machine.  If your data is going to need to be
         backed up, simply insert TWO diskettes into your drive.
         Whenever you update a document, the data will be written
         onto both disks.  A handy tip for more legible backup
         copies: Keep a container of iron filings at your desk.
         When you need to make two copies, sprinkle iron filings
         liberally between the diskettes before inserting them
         into the drive.

     FIDONEWS 13-39               Page 12                  23 Sep 1996


     (6) Diskettes should not be removed or inserted from the
         drive while the red light is on or flashing.  Doing so
         could result in smeared or possibly unreadable text.
         Occasionally, the red light remains flashing in what is
         known as a "hung" or "hooked" state.  If your system is
         hooking, you will probably need to insert a few coins
         before being allowed to access the slot.


     (7) If your diskette is full and needs more storage space,
         remove the disk from the drive and shake vigorously for
         two minutes.  This will pack the data enough (data
         compression) to allow for more storage.  Be sure to cover
         all openings with scotch tape to prevent loss of data.


     (8) Data access time may be greatly improved by cutting more
         holes in the diskette jacket.  This will provide more
         simultaneous access points to the disk.


     (9) Periodically spray diskettes with insecticide to prevent
         system bugs from spreading.....

                           QUESTION OF THE WEEK
     =================================================================


     There has been a distinct lack of .BIO [biography] files coming into
     FidoNews for publishing. Perhaps, FidoNet Sysops have suddenly become
     reticent about sharing their thoughts with the rest of us? [nah]

     Maybe you're just lazy?

     In that case, maybe you have an ABOUT file you offer to folks who use
     that old magicname convention? Maybe that's got your bio in it
     already?

     The Question of the Week is:

     Do you have an ABOUT file and will you send it in with an extension of
     .BIO [and meeting the other technical standards in ARTSPEC.DOC] so we
     can learn all about you? You don't have to be infamous to apply.

     Don't just keep it to yourself in those various Echos where you spout
     endlessly. Send in your .BIO. This means YOU!

     Latest Greatest Software Versions
     by Peter E. Popovich, 1:363/264

     While I usually attempt to keep this column purely Fidonews-related,
     I feel I should mention Jim Barchuk's efforts to spruce up the column
     using HTML tables. The effect is rather pleasing and can be seen at:

             http://www.geocities.com/Athens/6894/software.html

     Special note: ifmail & ifmail-tx have new versions. I remembered to
                   update the info, but forgot to include an update note
                   in the leader, so here it is now... ;-)

     Phased out this week: DreamBBS 1.05

     Phase-out highlights:
       This week: GSBBS 3.02 Deadline for info: 4 Oct 1996.
       Last week: Genesis Deluxe 3.2 Deadline for info: 27 Sep 1996.
