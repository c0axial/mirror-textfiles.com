                               Logic Chopping
                           A Study in Censorship


     Most of you are  probably  aware  of  the  recent  brouhaha  over
     EchoChop.  Not  long ago I announced that EchoChop would function
     no more,  that it  was  all  just  an  experiment.  This  left  a
     question or two unaswered,  like what was the experiment, and how
     did it turn out?

     I didn't answer that question before because the  experiment  was
     still running.  It ran in two phases:

         Phase one:  Create EchoChop and announce to the world what it
         is  and  what  it's  for.  This  served  mainly  to encourage
         expression from those who are against the idea.

         Phase two:  Have EchoChop expire at a preset time,  and  then
         announce to the world that it is no more.  This served mainly
         to  encourage  expression  from those who are in favor of the
         idea.

     Phase one happened mainly in public in the echomail  conferences,
     and  is  thus  pretty  well  known.  Phase two happened mainly in
     private network mail,  and is thus less publicly known.  Is still
     happening,  I  should say.  I'm on the verge of creating a canned
     message that says, "No, you can't have it, it's gone."

     What did I learn from all this?  Quite a bit  actually.  For  one
     thing,  a  great many people feel a need for some sort of control
     over echomail content.  But EchoChop (or anything like it) is not
     the way to go.  Echomail is chaotic enough already without people
     using things like EchoChop.  People want more order, not less.

     This implies some sort of  central  control  over  echomail.  But
     that  is  a  cure  that  leads to problems in its own right.  For
     example,   there  are  many  conferences  where   none   of   the
     participants want anyone outside having anything to say about it.

     What  I  propose  is  a compromise approach based on the tools we
     already have at hand.  Each conference in theory has a  moderator
     who  oversees  the  conference.  But up until now a moderator has
     been pretty powerless to actually do anything.  I propose that we
     define failure to abide by the wishes of a  conference  moderator
     as  excessively  annoying  behaviour.   The  remedies  stated  in
     Policy3 then come  into  play  to  back  up  the  wishes  of  the
     moderator.

     Of course,  we'll need some agreed upon way to determine just who
     the moderator of a given conference is,  since I'm assuming  here
     that  only  the  moderator  can  lodge  a  complaint for annoying
     behaviour.  So we pick some sucker,  er,  dedicated volunteer  to
     FidoNews 4-29                Page 2                    3 Aug 1987


     act  as  our  official  "Registrar  of Conferences" (Thomas Kenny
     comes to mind).  This would NOT mean that every  conference  must
     be  registered.  A conference would only have to be registered if
     its moderator wants to invoke  the  protection  of  Policy3.  The
     moderator  of  an  unregistered conference would simply be on his
     own when dealing with annoying behaviour (much  like  things  are
     now for all conferences).

     Does  this  mean that IFNA will finally get involved in echomail?
     Well,  yes it does.  I've heard that the  echomail  backbone  has
     sworn  to  go  on  strike  (or  some  such)  if IFNA ever touches
     echomail,  but  I'd like to point out that this approach involves
     IFNA in echomail only so far as the  participants  in  any  given
     conference desire -- and not really very far for all of that.

     There  are  four  restaurants  in  the  Radisson   ranging   from
     relatively "inexpensive" to "very,  very, expensive".  The sysops
     in net  109  are  compiling  a  list  of  establishments  in  the
     surrounding  neighborhood which will be available when you get to
     the conference.  During the Conference there will be a Banquet on
     Friday night and a luncheon on Saturday.  If you  are  interested
     in   attending   these,   don't  forget  to  mark  them  on  your
     registration form.

     FIDO-FAM Version 3 Release Announcement         by Dennis Glaeser

           filename       : FFAM301.ARC  (latest version is: 3.01)
           available from : Fido 100/10  (or any current user)

     FIDO-FAM is a FIDO BBS File Area Maintenance utility.  It allows
     the user to quickly and easily review, modify, and coordinate the
     files in any FIDO File Area with the appropriate FILES.BBS file.
     Version 3 also has some features to support OPUS BBSs (ver 0).

     This utility uses SYSTEMnn.BBS files to define the directories to
     use, and manages the files named: FILES.BBS, DIR.BBS, FILES.BAK,
     and DIR.BAK in each file area. FIDO-FAM will work with any system
     which uses these files as defined by FIDO (version 11w) specs.

     FIDO-FAM can be run locally on any computer running MSDOS or
     PCDOS 2.x or higher, and which has an ANSI terminal or device
     driver installed.

     FIDO-FAM can also be run remotely.  This allows authorized users
     to do file area maintenance from home.  The remote terminal, or
     modem program, being used MUST respond to the ANSI terminal
     control strings for:
                - Cursor Positioning
                - Clear Screen
                - Clear to End of Line
                - Set Colors - Note: color display not required.
     An 80 x 24 display is used, to support remote users who don't
     have 25 line screens.


                              Program Summary

     The following is an abreviated summary of FIDO-FAM's features.
     The ARC file contains a complete User Manual, ready to print.

     Syntax : FIDO-FAM [a] [b] [d] [i] [n] [r] [k]
                       [path to system files]
                       [SEND nn [nn..[nn]] TO filename]

     Command Line Parameters:

     A - Auto Adopt mode. Upon entry to a file area, new files are
         automatically added to FILES.BBS.
     B - No Backups. This option defeats the creation of .BAK files
         for FILES.BBS and DIR.BBS.
     D - Show File Date (the way OPUS does).
     I - Make Insert mode the default when editing strings
         (otherwise Overwrite mode will be the default).
     N - No ANSI Color commands are used.
     R - Restore original colors (for PCDOS machines only).

     Any multi-char input on the command line, except that which
     begins with the keyword 'SEND', is interpreted as the path where
     the SYSTEMn.BBS files are to be found.

     FidoNews 4-29                Page 5                    3 Aug 1987


     An environment string named FAMOPT may also be used to invoke
     FIDO-FAM options EXCEPT the SEND option. The FAMOPT string has
     the same format as the command line.

     If the keyword SEND is found on the command line, FIDO-FAM
     operates in a Batch SEND mode, rather than interractively. This
     means the program creates the SEND file(s) requested and then
     terminates.

     A SEND file is a copy of FILES.BBS with the File Size, and
     optionally File Date included. It is a file 'snapshot' of an
     Area's contents, and is also what a user will see when Fido (or
     Opus) displays a Files list for the Area.

     A SEND command will contain a filename and a list of Area
     Numbers. FIDO-FAM will create either a single file which
     concatenates the Areas together, or multiple files, one in each
     Area.

     SEND files can also be created while running FIDO-FAM
     interractively.

     The following is a list of commands available in the File Area
     Editor:
               Display Controls (scrolling, paging)
               Mark/Unmark Lines (many of the following commands
                                  operate on single or multiple
                                  entries in FILES.BBS. Multiple
                                  entries may be either a range of
                                  lines or all Marked Lines)
               Abandon/Adopt file(s)
               Send a Command to DOS
               Line Editor (for file names and comments)
               Find
               Regenerate the Display
               Insert a comment
               Jump (to a new location)
               Kill/Delete Line(s)
               Move/Copy lines (within this area or to another area)
               Overwrite this Comment
               Quit the Editor
               Rename the File
               Sort files (by Name, Extent, or Date)
               Date the file description
               View a File
               Move current line to another area
               Display a 'help' screen
               Adopt all orphans
               Remove Date from Comment(s)
               Edit DIR.BBS (one line only)
               Touch (update File Date & Time)

     This version of FIDO-FAM underwent about 3 months of Beta testing
     by a number of Sysops from all over the country. The program's
     functionality and user interface were developed in response to
     their comments.

     The telephone at the water and sewage department is often busy
     with calls from customers concerned with public health matters.

     RING!

     Southeast Treatment Plant, this is Zack.

     "Is this the water department?"

     Yes Ma'am, for most of this area.

     "Good.  I have some very technical questions to ask you about
     the water."

     I'll try and help.

     "Why are my nipples getting so hard?"

     You're not really serious.

     "I AM SO!!  My nipples ... they're hard and they have this
     white coating on them!"

     Uhhhh, huh ... hard, uhhh, nipples with white, uhh ... stuff
     ...

     "Not only that, they're getting warped!"

     I see.

     "They used to be soft, pink and round!"

     I'm sure they were.

     "Now they really look disgusting!"

     I'm sure they do.

     "So I want to know what you're going to do about this!"

     I really don't think I can help you.  Have you discussed this
     with your personal physician?

     "Yes I have!  He said I should call you because he thought it
     was from the water!"

     I see... uhhhh, just why and how does he think the water is
     causing this?

     FidoNews 4-29                Page 8                    3 Aug 1987


     "He said cleaning them in boiling water sometimes does that."

     Sounds painful.  Can't you just sponge them off?

     "Painful?!  THE BABY BOTTLE NIPPLES ARE THE ONES I'M TALKING
     ABOUT!"

     Now I understand.

     "Are you going to buy me new ones?"

     Why would we do that?

     "Because your water ruined these.  My baby won't suck them
     anymore.  He's been sick and I think it's from the white stuff
     ... he used to really suck ..."

     May I ask how old your baby is?

     "He's six, going on seven"

     Six ... and he refuses the bottle?  Maybe he's getting a little
     old for the bottle.

     "DON'T TELL ME HOW TO RAISE MY CHILD!"

     I wasn't.  How long have you been using these nipples?

     "Since he was born."

     "Hmmmmm.  My guess is the white film is from the calcium
     carbonate in the water ... kind of like bathtub ring of the
     nipple ..."

     "AND?!"

     ... and they are hard and warped because of being boiled and
     bitten for six years.

     "So!  You are refusing to pay!"

     Well, that's not for me to decide.  I was only trying to
     suggest they might just be plain worn out.

     "THEY WOULDN'T BE WORN OUT IF YOUR WATER WAS ANY GOOD!"

     There is really nothing more I can do for you.

     "JUST HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO GET MY MONEY?"

     Well, why not grab your nipples and run down to our main
     office.  There you can file an insurance claim.

     "What good would that do?  Will they give me the money?"

     They will investigate and make a judgement whether to settle or
     FidoNews 4-29                Page 9                    3 Aug 1987


     not.

     "Well, you sure haven't been any help!  How do I get them to
     pay more attention than you have?"

     Just show them your nipples.

     At  the  last few meetings of CASA (the  Cleveland/Akron  Sysops'
     Association),  I  had  a discussion with some Fido  sysops.   The
     similarities between Fidonet and Usenet were striking.

     Indeed, Fidonet is going through the same problems as the Usenet.
     In fact,  worse problems,  because they don't have any "backbone"
     sites,  in the Usenet sense:   no gatech,  no seismo (of  course,
     that's about to happen to us as well),  no UUNET,  nothing of the
     sort.   Excessively  low SNR could destroy the Fidonet much  more
     quickly than it would the Usenet: the current Usenet situation is
     untenable on the Fidonet.

     I've also become more involved with local Fido systems.  And seen
     this myself.

     When  it  comes  down  to  it,  anarchy  doesn't  work  when  the
     population is too high.  Fidonet is rapidly approaching the line,
     FidoNews 4-29                Page 11                   3 Aug 1987


     Usenet  passed it long ago but continues on sheer blind  inertia.
     (The  loss  of  seismo may well blow Usenet  sky-high.   Add  the
     possibility  that Gene Spafford may leave the net,  and  it  gets
     worse.   If  UUNET  fails (still possible) on top  of  everything
     else, the loss of coordinated effort may damage the Usenet beyond
     all hope of recovery.)

     It's  time to open our eyes and look at the world.   Part of this
     may involve the "backbone cabal" meeting with the IFNA "board  of
     directors"  (if and when) and comparing notes;  maybe together we
     can come up with a solution for both networks.   As it is,  it is
     certain that the current situation is teetering on the brink.
