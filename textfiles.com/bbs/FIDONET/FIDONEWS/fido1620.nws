     Greetings,

     So, the Z1C election process is starting soon - jolly good show.
     About time something was done.

     But what is happening with our IC lately?  Have not seen/heard/read
     anything from him for ages.  Is he still around or?  Anyone care to
     advice us?

     I must say, it's very strange that he does not even say 'boe' or
     at least say something to convince those at large he is alive.

     Enjoy,

     Z1C Election - Arguing with Success

                             Arguing with Success
                               The Z1C Election
                           Douglas Myers, 1:270/720
                               doug@mdtnbbs.com

     Gee... just when I thought the Z1C election was going well, I'm
     hearing complaints that it's degenerated into pointless bickering.
     This bickering, I'm told, is the reason there shouldn't be public
     elections on Fidonet.  Just to be contrary, I'd like to argue that
     the bickering is exactly why we should hold these elections as a
     regular feature.

     The Benefits of Bickering:

     1.  So long as there's bickering going on, it makes lie of the
     argument that the sysops of Fidonet don't care.

     2.  Fidonet brings bickering to a high art.  The early rounds of
     bickering in the Z1_ELECTION echo were started by Andrea Santos, who
     is probably the most qualified bickerer Fidonet has to offer.
     Andrea's posting is normally responsible and literate, giving her a
     high degree of personal credibility which is difficult to dismiss.
     Moreover, she's active as a Network Coordinator of the South Florida
     Net, so it's difficult to dismiss her as a non-contributor.  And
     she's been persistent and focused in her questions:  who decided
     that the voting for Z1C will be determined by a secret RC only vote.
     She can't be ignored, and she's been getting answers.

     3.  Bickering has brought the RCs out of the woodwork and into the
     public echoes.  A few short weeks ago, I was complaining here that
     the Z1C election didn't seem to be happening.  Though I think that
     Andrea's questions were more effective than my own editorial in
     bringing about action... the RC's did act.  Now there's a timetable,
     a set of procedures, and some of the RCs are even posting publicly
     about the election.

     4.  The RCs are bickering back.  I list this as an advantage because
     of the insight it brings for those of us who would know the folks
     charged with running Fidonet.

     5.  The bickering has actually brought about personal commitments
     on the part of the RCs to conduct an open and honest election beyond
     the bare requirements of either P4 or the stated election rules.

     6.  The bickering has caused us all to rethink some of our cherished
     notions:  should the ZC answer all the mail addressed to him, how
     should the RCs represent their regions, what is the quality of a
     person who would be ZC, how important is the ZC position to the NC's
     and end nodes...

     The Z1C election is going well.  No one is getting exactly what they
     want, folks are noisy and it promises to get even noisier.  Ross
     Cassell is saturating us with the same old message in multiple
     conferences.  All is well :)

     This process will consist of five phases..

     Phase 1: Nomination
     Phase 2: Discussion
     Phase 3: Regional Discussions
     Phase 4: Voting By RCC
     Phase 5: Installation of new ZC1

     [ Phase 1 - Nominations ]

     * When

       From 0000 hrs On 05/30/1999

         To 2359 hrs on 06/12/1999

       All times EDT

     * Which Echo

       Z1_ELECTION.. All nominations to be made publicly.

     * Who may run for ZC1.

       Any Fidonet Sysop In Zone One who is listed in NODELIST.141.

       Myself (election coordinator)

       Any sysop not physically located in Zone One or not listed in
       NODELIST.141.

     * Candidate qualifications.

       Candidates to be considered for the ZC1 position, should:

       [1] Possess good people/communication skills and be fair and open
           minded towards a wide and diverse zonal audience.

       [2] Possess a working knowledge and understanding of Fidonet Policy
           v4.07.

       [3] 'HAVE' the time or be able to set aside time in order to perform
           the duties required of the position. If the candidate is out of
           town a lot due to professional or personal obligations, then
           this candidate may want to reconsider said candidacy.

     * Who may nominate.

       Any Zone One sysop who is in the nodelist as of NODELIST.141.

       Each sysop may nominate only one individual including themselves.

     * Process.

       [1] For a nominee to be considered a valid ZC1 candidate s/he must
           meet the criteria outlined for candidates.

       [2] Nominations will consist of three phases:

           [A] Initial and qualifying nomination, either by themselves or
               by another sysop who is qualified to nominate.

           [B] A seconded nomination by another qualified sysop.

           [C] Upon successful first and seconded nominations, the nominee
               must then 'accept' the nomination.

       [3] Nominations are valid if made and accepted between 12:00am on
           the start of the nomination phase and 11:59pm on the end of the
           nomination phase, all times Eastern.

     [ Phase 2 - Discussions ]

     * When

       From 0000 hrs On 06/13/1999

         To 2359 hrs on 06/26/1999

       All times EDT

     * Discussion Phase.

       The discussion phase will be conducted publicly in the Z1_ELECTION
       echo, All interested sysops are urged to partake and solicit answers
       from the pool of available candidates garnered during the nomination
       phase.

       Z1_ELECTION will be moderated by Joe Jared, he will be charged with
       keeping the discussions on a civil level and he will not tolerate
       flaming, spamming or any other behavior in which the process is
       disturbed or otherwise impeded.

       The discussion phase is a process in which candidates can be called
       upon (or can volunteer) to put forth or defend their positions or
       philosophies on various Fidonet related issues. Their answers can be
       used to assist you in determining which candidates have the fitness
       to serve as ZC1.

       Candidates should avoid at all costs the practice of slinging mud at
       another candidate, if for no other reason than the preservation of
       credibility.
     FIDONEWS 16-20               Page 6                   17 May 1999


       Please be mindful that the candidates were nominated by those who
       thought the nominee could benifit Fidonet. Furthermore the
       candidates accepted said nominations because they think that they
       can help Fidonet. Having said this, no candidate is setting out with
       an agenda to destroy Fidonet or the world.. <g> Please leave these
       types of accusatory innuendos or personality conflicts somewhere
       else, they will not have a role in this election.

     [ Phase 3 - Regional Discussions ]

     * When

       From 0000 hrs On 06/27/1999

         To 2359 hrs on 07/03/1999

       All times EDT

     * Getting input to your RC.

       This phase will involve you at the local net level informing your NC
       as to whom you would like to see as ZC1 out of the pool of available
       candidates based on personal preference and what information you
       gathered from Phase 2. In turn your NC will take this information
       and pass it onto your RC, who will then use this information to cast
       the appropriate vote during Phase 4.

       To avoid the appearance of improprieties, all discussions relating
       to the election process either in this phase or phases 1 & 2, should
       be conducted publicly. Only use netmail/email methods if time
       constraints are evident and it would appear that echo lag would
       prevent you from getting your preference to your NC on time.

     [ Phase 4 - Voting Process ]

     * When

       From 0000 hrs On 07/04/1999

         To 2359 hrs on 07/10/1999 (or earlier if 10 votes recorded prior)

       All times EDT

     * Voting By the RCC.

       Voting on the available pool of candidates will be conducted by the
       RCC in the privately distributed Z1REGCON echo.

     [ Phase 5 -  Installment ]

     * Installing new ZC1.

       The installment process of the new ZC1 will commence without delay
       upon the announcement of the winner. The outgoing ZC1 will work with
       the new one to transfer over control files, coordinate links changes
       and bring him or her up tp speed on policy matters and procedures
     FIDONEWS 16-20               Page 7                   17 May 1999


       associated with the position. The outgoing ZC1 will make sure the
       incoming ZC1 is properly introduced to the ZCC and the Zone One RCC
       as well as making sure s/he is linked to all appropriate admin
       echoes and is properly echoing the Zone one admin echoes. As soon as
       the outgoing ZC1 is confident that the incoming ZC1 has all the
       tools and such to perform the position, the outgoing ZC1 will
       install the incoming ZC1 into the nodelist and the incoming ZC1 will
       immediately assume the duties and responsibilities of the position
       upon the issuance of that nodelist update. The incoming ZC1's term
       shall not begin until s/he is reflected as such in the nodelist.

     [Technicalities]

     * If only one candidate.

       Goto Phase 5, sole nominee will win by acclamation.

     * Voting protocol in phase 4.

       Scenario 1 - two candidates:

                    A candidate must receive a simply majority of 50% + 1
                    of all votes cast to be declared a winner. If all 10
                    RC's cast a vote, a minimum majority would be 6 votes.
                    If any RC fails to cast a vote, then the minimum
                    majority will be calculated from the total votes
                    recorded.

                    In the event of a tie vote under this scenario, the
                    outgoing ZC1, shall cast the deciding vote in order
                    for a winner to be declared.

       Scenario 2 - three or more candidates:

                    A candidate must receive the 50% + 1 votes as outlined
                    in scenario one. If one of these candidates does
                    receive a simple majority, we have a winner.

                    But for example if we have 3 candidates:

                    Candidate 1 receives 4
                    Candidate 2 receives 4
                    Candidate 3 receives 2

                    No single candidate received a majority vote.

                    Candidate 3 will be removed from the running, we will
                    then repeat phase 4 with only 2 candidates.

       Scenario 3 - scenario 2 with a twist:

                    Same criteria as in scenario 2, but:

                    Candidate 1 received 4
                    Candidate 2 received 3
                    Candidate 3 received 3
     FIDONEWS 16-20               Page 8                   17 May 1999


                    The outgoing ZC1 will cast a deciding vote for
                    candidate 2 or 3, then the candidate with the least
                    votes is dismissed, then scenario one is reached and
                    phase 4 repeated.

       Scenario 4 - More than three candidates:

                    The spirit of scenarios 2 & 3 is applicable, if no
                    single candidate receives a majority, two candidates
                    with the most votes are singled out to reach scenario
                    one and phase 4 is repeated with the 2 surviving
                    candidates.

                 ` -- -- -- -- -- --  -  -- -- -- -- -- -- '

     Ed Williams presents a different view on the subject of BBSes on the
     Internet.  This is extracted from his message to Lynda Kendrick in
     the echo FN_SYSOP.

     -------------------

     LK>       Ed, I enjoyed reading your message about how we as BBS
     LK>       sysop's do have a way of joining the Internet with our BBS's
     LK>       ..But how do we do that?  I am very interested!

     Joining the Internet with our BBS's......ME?  I would never propose
     such a thing, for various reasons.  A few of which I'll touch on
     below.

     Anyone who hitches their proverbial "Star" to the Internet is in for
     a sad awakening in a few years.  As communications systems become
     more and more evolved, the phone systems will take on a considerable
     appeal, and well the Internet will be your "junk mail" drawer again,
     but I will grant you it will be a neat one.

     The "traditional dial up" phone line will be around for quite some
     time. The rates and way we do things will change dramatically I'm
     sure.  But the internet is what it is, and it's not a phone service.

     I laugh at the memories now, of people complaining that for all it's
     glory, windows 3.1 is just a shell for DOS.

     Much the same thing can be said for what "people" are doing with the
     internet.  For all it's wonders, it's just a shell for the phone
     companies.  Once it makes that change over to an "independent"
     system, well the world's going to see a huge improvement over the
     internet.
     FIDONEWS 16-20               Page 9                   17 May 1999


     There's just too much wrong with it now, and the things wrong with
     it for us BBS's are just not in the interests of those  people
     making the Internet.  XML has promise for what us BBS'ers want, but
     it's not quite the same, and it's applications are far from a menu
     driven programming language.

     While I do believe that the Internet is a wondrous place for
     "artists, businesses, tech support, and scientific exchange", we
     have polluted it with enough "Crap" that these gem's are
     increasingly hard to find.  All too often someone goes to the net to
     find one thing, and ends up being distracted by half a dozen others.
     Before he knows it, he's out of time, the kids are begging to be
     tucked in, and life has passed him by.

     It's not people's fault really.  Heck even trying to find a tech
     support answer on the net takes longer to find on the net (that's if
     you know the address to look at) than it would to just call up their
     phone support systems.  But we foolishly believe the promise of
     quick and easy tech support, and yet we wait for E-Mails 2-3 day's
     out with our answer. I'd like to see anyone wait 2-3 day's on the
     phone.

     So as I was saying, it's not their fault, we as people have a
     variety of things we find interesting, and the Internet can bring
     bits and pieces of almost all of them at once.  Say you're
     interested in Jupiter, you could spend a year searching all of the
     jupiter stuff and get no where. We foolishly believe that as long as
     we look a little, we understand enough of the topic to satisfy our
     interest.  But we get half hazard information in bits and pieces
     that never quite make sense, no one help's us to sort out really or
     discusses with us, and keep looking or give up the search.  We are
     being molded to put up with crap.

     BBS's though do not play that silly little game with our callers
     minds. Not a bit.  We keep to a single topic or two for our BBS's,
     we have several people helping us keep track of the latest news,
     people who meet, chat, write messages regularly, and more.

     Instead of throwing "info" at people, we put them into "interest
     communities".  And who cares if a BBS doesn't have "Everything you
     ever needed to know about subject A", someone, maybe you can get new
     stuff, discuss it and share it with the same people who are not
     being constantly distracted by the maze of "info bits" out there in
     Interpolated.

     Every Sysop who uses the Internet to run a BBS on, and does not
     provide a "Dial up Connection" is a sysop with a constantly roving
     clientele. Regardless of whether he runs a fine BBS or a sloppy
     one.  This may be interesting, but it is not why people call BBS's.

     Beware the Borg, they have nifty technology, but they have no souls.

     BBS's are wondrous things, which I predict will blossom over the
     next few years, and as technology improves, people move farther and
     farther out into the country side, and work at home becomes a larger
     standard, and the service industry takes hold, that nearly everyone

     will run a BBS of some type.  But they'll probably settle for a
     nifty "Phone Banner" menu for the most part.

     I love technology, I love what it will do for us.  But this internet
     thing isn't where BBS's need to be getting "callers" from.
     Advertise it there, use it to get software easily distributed to
     call your BBS, put newsletters there so people can check it from any
     computer quickly. But don't get users from the net, get them when
     they're at home, on their own computer, and want to be on your
     system.

     The Queen's English (Author unknown)

             Let's face it -- English is a crazy language. Thre is no egg
     in eggplant nor ham in hamburger; neither apple nor pine in pineapple.
     English muffins weren't invented in England or French fries in France.
     Sweetmeats are candies while sweetbreads, which aren't sweet, are
     meat.
             We take English for granted. But if we explore its paradoxes,
     we find that quicksand can work slowly, boxing rings are square and a
     guinea pig is neither from Guinea nor is it a pig. And why is it that
     writers write but fingers don't fing, grocers don't groce and hammers
     don't ham. If the plural of tooth is teeth, why isn't the plural of
     booth beeth? One goose, two geese. So one moose, two meese?
             Doesn't it seem crazy that you can make amends but not one
     amend, that you can comb thorugh annals of history but not a single
     annal? If you have a bunch of odds and ends and get rid of all but one
     of them, what do you call it? If teachers taught, why didn't preachers
     praught? If a vegatarian eats vegtables, what does a humanitarian eat?
     If you wrote a letter, perhaps you bote your tongue?
             Sometimes I think all the English speakers should be committed
     to an asylum for the verbally insane. In what language do people
     recite at a play and play at a recital? Ship by truck and sent cargo
     by ship? Have noses that run and feet that smell? How can a slim
     chance and a fat chance be the same, while a wise man and a wise guy
     are opposites? How can overlook and oversee be opposites while a lot
     and quite a few are alike? How can weather be hot as hell one day and
     cold as hell another? Have you noticed that we talk about certain
     things only when they are absent? Have you ever seen a horseful
     carriage or a strapful gown? Met a sung hero or experienced requited
     love? Have you ever run into someone who was combobulated, gruntled,
     ruly or peccable? And where are those people who ARE spring chickens
     or who ACTUALLY hurt a fly?
             You have to marvel at the unique lunacy of a language in which
     your house can burn up as it burns down, in which you fill in a form
     by filling it out and in which an alarm clock goes off by going on.
     English was invented by people, not computeres, and it reflects the
     creativity of the human race (which of course, isn't a race at all).
     That is why, when the stars are out, they are visible, but when the
     lights are out, they are invisible. And why, when I wind up my watch,
     I start it, but when I wind up this essay, I end it.

     Latest Greatest Software Versions
     by Peter E. Popovich, 1:228/158

     Well, it has been quite a while. Been wondering if I should come
     back. Guess I just did. <grin>

     Everything is out of date. I've got a backlog, but while I catch
     up on old mail, I also want to get new mail as well. So write me.

     There's been some speculation about web page listings and e-mail
     addresses for this list. I do plan to add them to the web version
     of this list within the next couple of weeks. Please send them in.

     Please note the new contact info:
