                              Editorial
========================================================================
  There is not much of an editorial this week; we have been busy
enjoying ourselves <S>.  My son and his other have been sleeping
on the living room floor en route from Vancouver to Moncton by
thumb [maybe 6,000 km].  We have spent lots of hours talking
about the road, and I don't think it has changed much since the
sixties.

   We have an extremely interesting article on mail privacy
reprinted by permission of the author.  It is a bit longish,
but fascinating reading.

   Thank goodness the policy articles seem to have burned
themselves out, 'though caller id lingers on with nothing much
new being said.  I would like to read an article that said "I
have caller id because I am a paranoid control freak ... "  then
another that said "I want to ban it because my users are
paranoid, and I want them to be comfortable ...".

    Anyway, on to the snooze .......................cacti!.

The Cynic's Sandbox, v2.1BetaTestDoNotDistribute
R. Cynic

Was it March showers bring April flamewars, or the other way around?

Caller*ID: For the man who has nothing to hide.

Ol' Bill "Baldy" Shatner had it right... Get a life!  Ever since
this nifty Caller*ID debate came up, people have gotten *SO*
serious.  All this talking about MY system and MY privacy and
MY right to know... Tch, tch.

We're getting Caller*ID soon where I live.  It should be kinda
funny.  I can't wait to be called a fake user 'cause I log on
from a friend's house to get something for him.  Ahhh... To be
dumped from a BBS after seeing a polite banner like...

HACKER! HACKER! HACKER! HACKER! HACKER! HACKER! HACKER! HACKER!

You though you could fool ME, didn't you?  You stupid hacker.
I hope you burn.  I have your phone number, now, and I'll be
calling the police 'cause I got the right to protect MY
computer.  Kiss off and die.

HACKER! HACKER! HACKER! HACKER! HACKER! HACKER! HACKER! HACKER!

...Or, in reverse, to get a message from a user...

From:  MAD DEATH 666
To  :  Sysop
Subj:  CALLR ID

DEAR SYSOOP, I HOP THAT U R NOT U-ZING CALLR ID.  I THINK THAT
IT A VIOLASION OF MI PRIVASY.  DO U HAVE ANY WAREZ?

ALSO, CAN I GET ACESS TO ADULT SEXSHUN?

Of course, Caller*ID does show hope.  It's obvious that
computer types are getting serious about security.  I think
that the alternate validation methods sure to come into play
will help a lot.  I hear that Hayes is introducing a DNA
scanner that plugs right into any Optima modem and allows, for
the first time, TOTAL SYSTEM SECURITY.  I'll be looking forward
to that, but I'll probably buy the announced system from US
Robotics which plugs into any dual standard except a Sportster
and operates at twice the speed.  Pity they'll be incompatible.
Rockwell is working on a DNA chipset, which will allow low-end
modem vendors to integrate modem, fax, DNA scanning, and
manicure capabilities onto one low-cost board.  Should be fun.
It's good to see some security-minded people out there nowadays.

Next week:  The policy development kit.  Makes FidoNet policy
documents and is still sharp enough to slice through an
aluminum can!

Did I mention, "Fits easily in ANY tacklebox?"

The SIP_SURVIVOR Echo

                       The SIP_SURVIVOR Echo

WaZOO ... another echo. Big deal. What interest could yet
another echo hold for me?

In this case, plenty.

SIP_SURVIVOR is an echomail forum dedicated to the discussion of
the issues of survivors of incest and other forms of sexual
abuse, and how to recover from the effects of that abuse using
the Twelve Step model originally outlined in the book
"Alcoholics Anonymous" by Bill W., Dr. Bob, and others.

Most people think of Twelve Step programs in terms of
addictions: alcohol, (Alcoholics Anonymous), other drugs
(Narcotics Anonymous, Cocaine Anonymous, Overeaters Anonymous
[food can be a drug]), and the like. But they don't realize
that the Steps can be applied to recovery from sexual abuse.
And in SIP_SURVIVOR, we discuss how.
FidoNews 10-15                 Page:  4                    12 Apr 1993


SIP_SURVIVOR is an "open meeting." Anyone who wishes to learn
how the Steps can be used to overcome the effects of incest or
sexual abuse is welcome to participate, even if they are not
themselves a survivor.

Moderator-generated disucssion generally focuses on three
programs: Survivors of Incest Anonymous (SIA), Incest Survivors
Anonymous (ISA), and Incest Victims Anonymous (IVA). If there
are any others, please send netmail and the moderator will be
happy to include 'em.

In compliance with the Sixth Tradition, SIP_SURVIVOR is not
approved by SIA, ISA, IVA, AA, or any other Twelve Step program.
No affiliation or endorsement with any Twelve Step program is
implied or should be inferred.

In compliance with the Eleventh Tradition, handles are
encouraged. You need never use your real name in SIP_SURVIVOR.

Feeds are currently private; we're seeking backbone
distribution. (Send netmail to your REC asking him to support
SIP_SURVIVOR!) If you'd like a feed, contact Barb Murphy at
1:130/911. EVERYONE is welcome to participate. Friends of Bill
will receive a special welcome.

Keep comin' back ...

 Abstract

 Being an electronic postmaster requires diligence, knowledge of
 mailing systems on many mail networks and host operating systems,
 and the ability to sit in front of a workstation, trying to
 decipher bounced mail headers, for long hours every week.

 It also requires that the postmasters be scrupulously ethical about
 the confidentiality of the mail that passes in front of them,
 despite the fact that sometimes in order to clear up a mail problem
 the text of the message comes up on the screen.

 This paper explores some strategies used by campus postmasters on
 several campuses, and discusses some relevant issues of security,
 ethics, and responsible behavior.

 TEXT

 When the best way to send information to a colleague was to type it
 up, stick it in an envelope and entrust it to a postal carrier, few
 people had worries that the contents of that envelope would be seen
 by anyone but the intended recipient. "Tampering with the mails"
 was a federal offense, and the FBI would come after an offender
 with sirens screaming.

 Now, when electronic messages containing secret research results,
 resumes, corporate business plans, and love letters are flying
 around the world, some users have valid concerns about the
 confidentiality of their messages. Are they really "confidential"?
 Can anything that passes over a phone line be considered secure?
 What happens if there is a machine problem, or an incorrect
 address, or any of a dozen known mail disasters? Who sees the mail?

 As postmasters at the University of Michigan, my colleagues and I
 see more than a hundred bounced messages a week. We have no
 technological mechanism to keep us from reading the text of these
 messages; only our personal ethical systems and a code of
 responsibility for postmasters at our site keeps us from reading
 the text of users' messages. The question of confidentiality, and
 what responsibility postmasters have to keep the contents of mail
 confidential, is one that arises in conversation between
 postmasters, and in inquiries from users, on a regular basis.

 I decided to poll a group of postmasters to see how they felt about
 the issue, what guidelines they used, and what responsibility they
 felt toward the users' text.

 Methodology

 Subjects: Sixty-nine people at academic, public, private, and
 commercial sites responded to a survey sent to 136 postmasters. I
 sent the survey to a list of postmasteres the University of
 Michigan postmasters have dealt with in the last year or two, or
 who were on a list of postmasters in Michigan. I recognize that
 this is by no means a majority of the available postmasters around
 the world, but I knew from dealing with most of them on and off
 through the past years that they were responsive to mail from other
 postmasters and from users. (This in itself may be anomalous, but I
 choose to hope not!) I hoped this meant I would get a large return
 of my surveys, and I am quite pleased with my 51% return.

 Distribution: The survey instrument was distributed and returned by
 electronic mail. In one or two instances respondents had questions
 about the survey, and these clarification conversations were also
 held electronically.

 Statistical method: We(1) analyzed the responses to the survey
FidoNews 10-15                 Page: 10                    12 Apr 1993

 statistically with the goal of identifying and describing various
 groups and perspectives among the postmasters who responded. The
 survey combined closed-ended and open-ended questions; the former
 were coded for data entry directly from the survey. I grouped the
 open-ended responses to each question into a smaller number of
 categories; these categories were then coded as a series of
 dichotomous variables. This procedure facilitated later analysis by
 accepting any number of responses to a question from each
 postmaster who responded. After the data were entered, SPSSx
 (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) was used to generate
 frequency and crosstab distributions. SPSSx also includes a
 multiple response procedure to facilitate tabulation of responses
 when each respondent could make any number of responses. From the
 (voluminous) output of these procedures, I could ascertain which
 attitudes and behaviors were congruent with a self-description of
 "confidential" and which were considered a central focus of
 confidentiality less often; these findings are presented in more
 detail below.

 Who responded to this survey?

 The average postmaster who responded is twenty-nine, has worked as
 a postmaster for two years, and supports 1500 users. He (only four
 of my respondents were female) works on a VMS or Unix machine
 that's devoted primarily to academic work, and has a bachelor's
 degree.

 Postmasters from all sorts of systems responded, including several
 from foreign countries: Canada, Ireland, Australia, and Japan. They
 ranged in age from twenty-one to fifty-three, and used eighteen
 different kinds of machines and operating systems. Only one
 respondent had been dealing with electronic mail for over ten
 years, while the majority had been in their jobs less than three
 years. Eighty percent had at least a college degree, but sixteen
 percent had only a high-school education and further on-the-job
 training.

 Some served as few as ten users, while the highest number of users
 was fifty thousand. The systems represented were overwhelmingly
 academic: fifty-three academic systems, four commercial, two public
 access systems, and four which were research or private use only.

 Defining confidentiality

 Overwhelmingly, when asked if they had a responsibility to keep
 users' mail confidential, the postmasters said "Yes". 94% of those
 who responded considered this a prime responsibility. (The other
 six percent, who were all on public or commercial systems,
 indicated that their users were not supposed to be using the mails
 for private or confidential mail, and therefore the postmasters
 felt no responsibility to keep the mails confidential.) Some
 postmasters felt this was a professional responsibility. Said one,
 "Unprofessionalism is the only reason for not respecting user
 privacy." Others cited the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of
 1986, which requires that system owners keep confidential, under
FidoNews 10-15                 Page: 11                    12 Apr 1993

 penalty of law, the mail messages of users on that system. Some
 felt that responsibility for confidentiality went beyond the
 message text, and extended to traffic analysis as well. To quote
 one postmaster:

 Often traffic analysis is as revealing as actual message contents.
 One example of this from my own experience came from an affair
 between a faculty member and a secretary (both are married, not to
 each other). I was perusing the mail logs and noticed a lot of
 traffic between these two, and I thought it was a little unusual
 since these two would not normally have any job-related reasons for
 such extensive communication. About six months later the affair
 became common knowledge, and at that point I realized I was
 probably the first person to know about their affair.

 I have a medical background, and keeping such matters confidential
 is second nature to me. Other postmasters without such a background
 would do well to examine the medical profession for some lessons on
 how to handle confidential material that strays into their path.

 To look or not to look -- that is the question

 When I began this survey, I was working on the assumption that most
 postmasters work as my colleagues and I do: that the text (2) of
 the message was not to be read under any circumstances, and that
 should we happen to see the text, we forget it immediately and do
 not use any information we might gain from the text of the message.

 I quickly discovered that we are in the minority.

 Most of the postmasters who said mail was confidential also said
 there were legitimate reasons to look at the text of messages (48
 out of 69, or 78%). By far the most common reason cited was to help
 re-direct the message. 53% of the respondents said that they would
 read the users' message for clues to help send the message back to
 the original sender or on to the intended recipient.(3) Another
 common reason was to scan the messages for improper or
 inappropriate use of the mails -- 29% look for harassing messages,
 illegal transactions, attempts to break into the system, etc.
 (Interestingly enough, most of the postmasters who said that they
 regularly scan the mails say that they use something like an editor
 scan to do this, rather than reading the contents of all the mail
 messages themselves. Ten respondents, however, stated categorically
 that scanning the mail for any reason was improper.)

 Postmasters in this study leave some of the responsibility on the
 users, too. "Accidents happen", commented ten in their responses.
 One respondent put it succinctly:

 Electronic mail is not a secure medium. It's the senders'
 responsibility to ensure the privacy of their messages. If they're
 not sure of the address they're sending to, they shouldn't put
 anything confidential in the text. Anything they don't want seen,
 and read, should be encrypted.(4)

FidoNews 10-15                 Page: 12                    12 Apr 1993

 When reading through the postmasters' comments, it was clear that
 most of them strongly believe that they act in a manner consistent
 with their ethical systems, and that they have given a lot of
 thought to confidentiality in mail systems. Confidentiality, it
 seems, consists in not looking unless you have to, and if you have
 to, treating what you see with respect. Or, as one of our foreign
 postmasters said, "... a postmaster is in the same position as a
 doctor -- peeking at personal e-mail is rather akin to viewing
 inside somebody's underpants -- there MAY be sound reasons for
 examining the contents but going out of one's way to do so is a bit
 kinky :-)"(5)

 Moral Dilemmas

 Sometimes what a postmaster sees creates ethical problems. If a
 postmaster sees a message in which personal or secret information
 is revealed, a postmaster may keep the information confidential but
 be troubled by it. Some find themselves in possession of
 information which indicates that an illegal transaction or
 inappropriate use of the system is going on. Most (65%) of the
 postmasters said that if they found information indicating a system
 abuse, they would immediately act on it. Their highest
 responsibility is to protect the system, and they take that
 responsibility very seriously.

 Personal information, like the affair that was mentioned above, is
 a different matter. Some of the postmasters indicated in their
 commentary that they tried to forget such information. Some created
 technological barriers for themselves to prevent the viewing of
 such information. Most hoped that they never had to make a decision
 about dealing with personal information that came into their
 possession.(6)

 Another dilemma for postmasters comes when they have permission to
 read the contents of users' mailboxes by virtue of their position.
 Fifty-three of our postmasters (77%) have privileged access. (It
 was in asking this question that we discovered how many hats most
 postmasters wear. Twenty-nine of them mentioned that they are also
 system administrators, and have unlimited access to any system file
 by virtue of that position. The others have unlimited access merely
 to accomplish their postmaster responsibilities.) However, in
 comparing the folks who believed there were good reasons to look in
 users' mailboxes against those who had access, only eight
 postmasters (less than half of those who believe in regularly
 scanning mail) believed this access should be regularly used.

 Technical fixes

 Technical fixes were also not common for general prevention against
 seeing text. Less than one-quarter of the respondents considered
 themselves to have a technological barrier to seeing the users'
 text. Only 25% of those who had a technical fix had a hard fix
 (that is, one which they had to exert special privileges or change
 code in order to see the message text): 19% used a filter which
 kept the text out of reach, and 6% encrypted the message text,
FidoNews 10-15                 Page: 13                    12 Apr 1993

 leaving only the headers in the clear.

 The others who considered themselves to have a technological fix
 were split half and half on a honor system where they only looked
 at bounced messages which couldn't get back to the sender or on to
 the recipient(7), or only read spool or file headers.

 "I close my eyes"

 By far the largest number of postmasters did not feel they had a
 technological barrier to seeing mail. Of those folks (80% of the
 total respondents), the three most common methods mentioned(8) as
 ways they avoided looking at text were to look away (45%), adjust
 the windowing on their screens to exclude the text (or attention
 out before the text scrolled by) (17%), or to ask the user's
 permission if it was impossible to fix the problem without reading
 the text (9%). (Interestingly enough, of those folks who said they
 wanted the user's permission before they went poking around in a
 mailbox, only two would use that permission even if they had it.)

 It was in asking about methods postmasters used to keep themselves
 from seeing users' text that the strongest statements about
 confidentiality and ethical behavior came out. As one of postmaster
 said, when asked the method he used:

 Self-restraint. The same thing that keeps me from performing most
 other unethical acts. Given my level of technical expertise, I do
 not regard "security systems" as any sort of deterrent.

 It's worth noting here that a large percentage (68%) of the
 respondents mentioned that they were simply too swamped with work
 to bother reading other people's mail, even if they were inclined
 to do so.

 Harassment, obscenity, and other inappropriate mail

 Unfortunately, as the telephone companies have discovered, some
 people want to use this marvelous new medium as a playground, or as
 a method of inflicting pain on another person. Electronic mail is a
 perfect opportunity to send harassing, obscene, or otherwise
 inappropriate messages to another person.

 While postmasters generally have given a lot of thought to their
 philosophies concerning what to do about user text, they are less
 certain about incidences of inappropriate mail. Seventeen of our
 postmasters (25% of the total) believe that there has never been
 such an incident at their site. (I confess, I'm inclined to believe
 that they simply don't know about it. In our experience, users will
 wait a long time without reporting harassment or obscene mail
 unless it's widely known that they have a resource for this
 situation. When we began advertising that there was a special
 office for handling these problems, reporting went up.)

 Some of them don't handle cases of inappropriate mail (29%). Of
 those who don't handle it themselves, four pass cases along to
FidoNews 10-15                 Page: 14                    12 Apr 1993

 campus security or the local police, and twenty-two let some other
 administrator handle it.

 A clear division of philosophy showed in deciding what to do about
 abusive or inappropriate mail when it happened. When asked whether
 they would wait for complaints or pursue a situation if they
 stumbled across one, 59% said they would wait for complaints, 23%
 said they would pursue it, and 10% said they would have to make a
 case-by-case determination.

 By and large, the largest group were those who would wait for
 complaints. "One person's harassment is another's amusement" was a
 frequently expressed sentiment (41%). However, there were some
 cases where postmasters felt obliged to step in, as in this
 comment:

 Material of a libelous nature, for example, is permissible in a
 private communication... Certain material is not permissible ....
 Child pornography is a good example of this. The Supreme Court just
 ruled that private possession of such material is illegal (as
 opposed to distributing it, which has been illegal for quite some
 time). Although I have never encountered such material, if I
 happened to find some in the course of my duties as postmaster I
 would have to contact the person responsible and ask them to remove
 it from the system. Failure to do so would make me (and the
 institution I work for) liable in any subsequent prosecution of the
 people involved.

 Other reasons for pursuing a problem that dropped into one's lap
 were system abuses (such as chain letters, attempts to break into
 the system or propagate virii or worms) or mail that came from
 another system. Off-site mail would, generally, be referred back to
 a postmaster at the originating site.

 "Mail is mail"

 Mailing lists(9) and newsgroups constitute a large part of the
 traffic on the network. Except for the case of usenet news, which
 is read with a special program, mailing lists are indistinguishable
 from most other mail messages.

 Because of mailing lists' public nature, I wondered how postmasters
 at other site regarded mailing list messages in terms of
 confidentiality.

 When asked if they considered mailing list mail in the same class
 as "regular" electronic mail, 42% said no. Of those folks who gave
 reasons for this answer, sixteen said that mailing list messages
 were intended for public distribution and thus not intended to be
 confidential or private. Twelve folks compared public mailing lists
 to junk mail or newspapers.

 The 56% who said "yes" indicated that they considered mailing lists
 like any other mail in terms of a need for confidentiality and
 respect for users' privacy. Sixteen felt this way because some
FidoNews 10-15                 Page: 15                    12 Apr 1993

 lists have restricted access and fourteen commented on the
 politically or personally sensitive contents of some mailing list
 discussions. Eleven postmasters felt that the identities of people
 who subscribed to mailing lists should be kept confidential,
 because of the personality or interest profile that could be
 inferred from a complete compilation of the sorts of lists a user
 subscribed to. Postmasters were sensitive to this:

 Although ostensibly anyone can get access to the same info by
 joining the list, membership itself on some lists may be considered
 sensitive. For instance, there is a gay-oriented list which one of
 my faculty members subscribed to, and the messages all began
 bouncing to the postmaster when he incorrectly set a forwarding
 address. This person may or may not care who knows about his
 subscription, but I can see where he might consider it sensitive
 information.

 Written ethics guidelines As networking constitutes a greater part
 of our lives, more and more personal information is loose on the
 nets. Codes of postmaster behavior, once handed down from guru to
 guru, may now need to be more formalized. Access to personal
 material is more prevalent, and mail is particularly susceptible to
 invisible monitoring.

 As one postmaster said: No byte of information in any computer
 system is immune to the knowledgeable systems programmer. The point
 here is that you can tell if your letter from Grandma has been
 opened, but you cannot tell if your electronic mail message has.
 This makes snooping easier and more prevalent by default. 83% of
 the respondents said they didn't have a written code of ethics for
 postmasters. Reasons given for why there was no policy varied
 across the board: 23% felt they didn't need such a thing, either
 because they wouldn't hire someone as a postmaster/system employee
 who wouldn't behave ethically or because postmaster ethics were
 common knowledge. 6% had orientation sessions in which postmaster
 ethics were discussed. 4% felt written policies of any sort were A
 Bad Idea. However, 15% of the total respondents wished there was a
 written policy, to help orient and train new postmasters or to
 cover gray areas. One quarter of those who had written policies
 felt that their general systems or employee policies covered
 postmasters as well as users. Two postmasters (both from religious
 private schools) indicated that Christian ethics covered the
 situation, and that they relied upon the Bible as a written policy
 for all occasions.

 Several postmasters commented that since the passage of the ECPA
 (10) in 1986, their sites have modified their systems use policies
 to include specifically use and misuse of mail.

 Major exceptions

 It's worth noting that commercial systems and public access systems
 had substantially differing views of user privacy with respect to
 mail than did academic systems. Of those who responded, nearly 10%
 were commercial or public access. The public access hosts were
FidoNews 10-15                 Page: 16                    12 Apr 1993

 extremely sensitive to their liability should illicit activities
 take place on their hosts. One public access "sysop" explained his
 approach to confidentiality this way:

 The mail on [this system] is specifically disclaimed from ECPA
 privacy in light of the fact that I operate a BBS on the machine
 and have no wish to have the authorities come seize the machine if
 some user does something illegal. Even so, I tend to preserve the
 confidence of information gleaned from mail that has to be seen. I
 have an automatic process that scans the mail daily for particular
 keywords and phrases that would indicate that phreaks or crackers
 are communicating via my system. If there is a suspicious item, a
 copy is pulled for closer inspection. So far, I have only has to
 read mail to/from one pair of users and it turned out that they had
 misrepresented themselves and were kicked off the system

 Commercial systems were equally cautious. One postmaster who works
 for a company which reputedly screens its employees tightly for
 ethical and moral fiber had this to say:

 Attached you will find your mail survey. Some of the questions are
 rather interesting. [Our company] doesn't appear to have similar
 problems with ethics as do some of the universities. It probably
 has do with the fact that employees are screened before they are
 hired to ensure that their ethics fall in line with the companies.
 Unfortunately, universities don't have such luxury.

 In the questionnaire, I mention that there aren't any formal
 policies regarding email. I believe that email would be covered
 under the terms of employment, which also specify acceptable ethics
 behavior. If somebody was foolish enough to use a corporate asset
 to harass somebody, or cause harm or interruption of service due to
 "hacking", then they probably would be terminated.

 Demographic Differences

 I asked a number of demographic questions, intended to see if we
 could distinguish behaviors of philosophies based on age, gender,
 number of years as a postmaster, systems or software used, or
 number of users served. No major discrepancies in behavior turned
 up. It's possible that our statistical "universe" was too small to
 differentiate such behavior trends. It's also possible that
 postmasters all tend to behave in an ethically consistent manner,
 despite the demographic differences.

 "Satisfaction guaranteed"

 Processing this survey has been a learning experience, and not just
 because of learning to handle statistical analysis.

 My expectations of postmasters have been largely met -- I had hoped
 to discover that the electronic information transfer medium was
 watched over by folks who would respect my privacy within the
 constraints of the technology, and I have not been disappointed.

FidoNews 10-15                 Page: 17                    12 Apr 1993

 I was surprised to see that there was no appreciable difference in
 approaches to ethical behavior among systems: some operating
 systems, such as Unix (tm), have a reputation for attracting
 mavericks; and some mail networks, such as BITNET, have extremely
 tight codes for appropriate behaviors. I was pleased to see that
 postmasters across the board regarded privacy and confidentiality
 as important, and would work to protect the system and the users'
 privacy equally.

 I would have liked to have seen more women as postmasters. Here at
 The University of Michigan, 50% of the postmasters and a large
 minority of the mail programmers are women. I hope that my sample
 is not representative of the larger whole, and that more than 12%
 of postmasters are women. (It's possible that many of the people
 who didn't respond to the question about gender were women. I have
 no way to tell.)

 On the whole, I think our users can be generally reassured that the
 electronic postmasters in their lives are concerned about the
 integrity of the mail system, both in terms of system security and
 user privacy. As electronic mail becomes a more prevalent method of
 communications (for both convenience, economic, and ecological
 reasons), it's nice to know that the tradition of confidentiality
 that we have grown to expect from our paper mail postmasters has
 been carried over into the electronic world.

 (6) One anecdote is particularly telling. To quote the respondent:
FidoNews 10-15                 Page: 18                    12 Apr 1993


 [The story starts with a description of a bug in a mailer that left
 a number of messages in the postmaster's queue. The respondent
 describes his usual practice of reading only the first 30 lines,
 since usually those 30 lines are only header material.]

 One of the dead items originated locally. Hence, it had
 comparatively few headers, and [the first 30 lines] took care of
 all the headers and showed me the body as well. It was from one of
 my co-workers, written to a friend with whom I also work
 professionally on the side from time to time. Although I didn't
 intend to read it, certain words caught my eye without really
 looking deliberately, and it became immediately obvious that my
 co-worker and this friend were having an affair.

 To say that this made me uncomfortable is to put the matter most
 mildly. My co-worker is married and the co-worker's spouse is also
 an acquaintance of mine. And I have a little (but not much)
 professional contact with the spouse as well. It was clear that the
 co-worker had not informed the spouse of the matter.

 The friend is also married and the friend's spouse was not aware,
 either. I have to work with my co-worker and frequently I am in a
 position where I can't really afford not to work with the friend.

 Now, whether two people want to carry on an affair with one another
 is mostly their own business. Whether I agree with it or not is
 almost entirely irrelevant, especially considering that my beliefs
 do not coincide with my friend's and my co-worker's anyway. But now
 I was in a position where a co-worker whom I trusted was violating
 the spouse's trust. And likewise for the friend and the friend's
 spouse. It became obvious to me in rather short order that it was
 going to be difficult to work with either of them, knowing the lack
 of trust being shown to their respective spouses.

 After some considerable internal warring against myself over what
 to do, I approached my co-worker, explained what I'd learned and
 the (innocent) circumstances by which I'd learned it, and said that
 I thought there were 3 things that could be done. The two of them
 could break off the relationship; they could tell their spouses
 about it and (I suppose) get the spouses' approval for them to
 continue; or I could resign. There wasn't really any way I could
 see myself continuing to work with people that I had to trust in
 order to get work done, while knowing this violation of trust was
 going on. And I don't think I really cared which way the matter
 went.

 As it happened, they broke off the relationship. Whether spouses
 were told about the matter, I can't say.

 I have since written a small tool which looks at this type of dead
 letter to show me JUST the headers.

Caller ID Still Isn't Reliable
Jack Decker
Fidonet 1:154/8

CALLER ID STILL ISN'T RELIABLE

After reading the debate over Caller ID that has been raging in the
last few issues, I have to wonder if anyone stopped to notice the
point that Caller ID is NOT yet reliable.  Specifically, it is quite
possible for a call to come in indicating that the calling number has
been blocked by the caller, when in fact the caller has done no such
thing.  In my previous article on the subject, I pointed out how ALL
calls from certain exchanges in California were being shown as
"blocked" on displays in other states (Caller ID isn't being made
available in California itself), in what some feel is a blatent
attempt by Pac*Bell to get customers to complain to the California
Public Utilities Commission (when their calls to other states won't
go through), in the hope that the California PUC will drop their
insistance that unlisted calling numbers be blocked by default.  The
speculation here is that the erroneous display is intentional; that
is, that Pac*Bell knows that their CUSTOMER never intended to block
display of his number, but that Pac*Bell itself chooses to present

However, there is a saying that one should never attribute to malice
what can be adequately explained by stupidity... and thus we bring
you this report from New York, courtesy of a reader of the Internet

In New York, where Caller ID is being implemented, slowly, Nynex has
provided the following peculiarity.  If you get a call from an
exchange that will *soon* have Caller ID enabled, but doesn't yet, it
shows up as Blocked, not as Out of Area.

Explanation?  The switching equipment is now capable of passing the
CLID information along, but the caller has not yet had the
opportunity to select the blocking option.  So the phone company has
decided to mark *all* calls as blocked.

(Their explanation, not mine.)

If I had the equipment you describe, I wouldn't be receiving any
local calls for a while.

[End of forwarded message from the Telecom Digest]

By way of explanation, the device originally mentioned in the quoted
section of the above message apparently does for voice calls what
some Fidonet sysops want to do on data calls, that is, it prevents
calls from "blocked" numbers from ever getting through.  The point
that needs to be emphasized repeatedly is that Caller ID technology
IS NOT YET RELIABLE.  In some cases calls WILL show up indicating
that the caller has blocked transmission of his or her number, when
in fact the caller has done no such thing (and may not even be aware
of what Caller ID is!).

It seems that those who want to argue in favor of using Caller ID
exclusively for verification want to completely ignore this point.
It reminds me of the folks who will argue that cellular telephone
conversations are now secure (in the United States) because the law
says that folks can't legally listen to them, completely ignoring the
fact that there are still thousands of scanners out there capable of
FidoNews 10-15                 Page: 21                    12 Apr 1993

receiving the cellular frequencies.  You would think that folks who
work with a technology would want to be aware of the limitations of
that technology, but I guess it's more convenient to ignore flaws in
the system (at least until they adversely affect you personally).

Again, I am not saying that you shouldn't use Caller ID as ONE method
of verification.  All I am saying is that a call comes in as
"blocked", you might want to at least assume that it could be some
hapless soul calling who has no idea that the phone company is
telling you that he has blocked the display of his phone number, and
provide some alternate method of access.  Even a one-screen display
explaining the situation and inviting the person to call the sysop on
a voice line (or to send a letter of explanation) would be nicer than
just assuming it's some twit trying to be anonymous, or trying to
crash your system.

Sometimes sysops (and even programmers) just get too smart for their
own good (or at least their callers' good).  I recall when the
original Opus BBS software rejected any city name with less than four
characters, presumably under the theory that any real city name was
at least four characters long.  Of course, this caused nothing but
trouble for callers from Ada, Michigan (suburb of Grand Rapids and
home of the Amway Corporation).  It's bad enough to be discriminated
against by humans for no fault of your own, but when computers start
doing it, it can be really maddening.  Please use the new technology
wisely, and realize that it ain't perfect yet!

New VW echo starting!!!
   Andy Heckel
   Fido 1:203/15

After hooking up to the Fido echo AUTOMOTIVE, I've started to see
others like myself interested in a specific manufacturer echo. Since
I am a VW nut, I figured I may as well jump on the bandwagon, take
the reins, and go for it, (kinda like jumping head first into an empty
pool). So, this is to announce the newest, (as of this moment), Fido
echo, VOLKS. If you would like to add this echo to your BBS, send me
netmail at 1:203/15, and I'll set you up. Hopefully, this may
eventually make it on to the backbone, if there is enough demand for
it. So help out and if you love your VW as much as I do, areafix it
today!!!

School Music Echo

by Ian Levstein  1:249/121
Areatag:  ORCHESTRA

Although there are many FidoNet echoes dealing with music, there
is a serious lack of information concerning school music.  To that
end, several of us have put together an echo specifically dealing
with all aspects of school music - concert band, orchestra, choir,
marching band, and other such groupings.  We also discuss other
aspects of music such as: film scores, community and professional
orchestras, conductors, and the like.

This echo began a number of months ago and at present has about a
dozen nodes attached covering Southern Ontario to Texas and points
in between.  We would like to see this echo grow and hopefully
get backboned at some point in the future.

If you are interested in receiving this echo, please netmail any of
these persons - we deliver at v32b!
