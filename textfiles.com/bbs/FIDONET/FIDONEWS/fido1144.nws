========================================================================
    I spoke to a Mr. Green of Plannet Connect the other day, and
am convinced that the fuss over censorship of fidonet echos is
unjustified.  It appears that the monitoring that was being done
was primarily to weed out a large number of phony messages and
duplicates that were being introduced into the datastream (in
what appeared to be a malicious and deliberately destructive
manner I might add).

    On other fronts, the ZEC election is over, and the results
are included in this issue.  As well, an update on the Italian
BBS raids of several months back.

    Here is your snooze ...

What the HELL has happened to FIDO?

What a question.  Now Net 205 has had its share of problems.
Many still remember the harrassment charges going around,
the splits between Net 205, 214 and 217.  These Nets weren't
even heard of before the blow up around here.  Since then, Net 205,
214 and 217 have joined echos, communicate regularly and even
share many common interests.

How it was!

In June of '93 our NC called it quits,  shortly there after, the
NEC quits.  Our NEC was the mail feed, and the NC was sort of a
strong NC.  She simply tried to keep the Net within a small confined
structure.  She lived by a rule that kept the Net growing for several
years, "Calm down it's a hobby!".  Well no one else wanted the job
with all of the turmoil, and here I woke up one morning and I was "IT".

How it Changed!

Well I decided that I had a choice, either take a position or let the
Net die.  I sat back and watched the Net from a different point of view,
Administratively, for about 2 weeks and decided what position to take.
The middle one. Everyone was right.  They had all bought their systems,
they all paid their own phone bills, they all had different themes on
their board.  Nobody was wrong, Soooo, what do I do, I lifted
excommunication of one of the sysops.  Once I did that, he quit
harrassing everyone.  Other sysops even named a local echo for him.
Another local echo "SOAPBOX" picked up speed.  The arguing and debating
still continue there UNMODERATED. And the general stuff went back to
general.  Want echos, chatter etc... are now just that.

The Moral!

We can't change people.  The easiest way to stop a problem is to not
FidoNews 11-44                 Page:  3                    31 Oct 1994

try to.  The problem will generally subside and in most cases cease if
it is worked with.  With in excess of 1,000,000 users and over 30,000
boards, we should know by now that dealing with problems through
policy or rules simply doesn't work.  Policies are GUIDELINES.  Rules
are fun to break.  Seeing the response is even more of a kick.

                In closing I quote a very wise women,
                "For crying out load, it's a hobby!"

FrontDoor License Interpretation

by James Smith
Online Communications, Inc.
Distributor of FrontDoor for the Americas

There has been much discussion of late, in the FrontDoor echo, and
other multi-line echoes regarding the license interpretation provided
by FrontDoor shareware version, and our commercial package. This
letter is intended to set the record straight as to the intent of
Online Communications Inc. (U.S. agent for Absolute Solutions) to
enforce the license agreement in accordance with U.S. Copyright law.

The new technology employed by many of our products (such as FrontDoor)
will indicate whether a node is running a legitimate copy. Judging from
the monitored traffic in the FrontDoor Echo and others, it is apparent
that there are far too many "invalid serial number" reports, and other
violations for us not to take this matter seriously.

Shareware Products:

Our shareware agreement grants a limited use license for both registered
and unregistered non-commercial use of the product. Non-registered use
is limited to a 30 day trail or evaluation of our shareware products.
After 30 days, the user must stop using the product, or register it by
purchasing a license to use (LTU) through Online Communications.
Continued unlicensed use of the product beyond the 30 day period
constitutes copyright infringement which we are prepared to litigate.

Registered use of our product requires that each copy run
simultaneously, be registered by purchasing a license to use (LTU) for
each copy that is in simultaneous use. This includes the use of
multiple copies that are loaded into memory, and are being run under a
multi-tasker to service multiple lines for mail, BBS and other
operations. If you run two or more nodes, then two or more licenses must
be purchased through Online Communications. Failure to do so puts an
individual in violation of our license agreement as specified under
section 3 of said agreement.

In all cases, the shareware version must be used in a non-commercial
environment as defined in our license agreement. If used in a
FidoNews 11-44                 Page:  4                    31 Oct 1994

commercial setting, the individual doing so is in violation of our
license and is subject to having their license revoked, and subject to
subsequent actions by Online Communications Inc.

Commercial Products:

Our commercial product (current version FrontDoor 2.20.c/ml), must be
purchased. There is no "shareware" version of the commercial product.
Anyone caught operating an unlicensed copy of our FrontDoor /ml or of
TosScan is regarded to be infringing on our copyright, and is subject
to litigation and prosecution to the fullest extent of the law.

Reporting Procedures:

Anyone having information and substantiating documentation of license
misuse of any of our products (e.g. FrontDoor, TosScan, FDAPX), should
forward such documentation and detail your observations to Online
Communications 1:132/300 or 1:132/301 or to the OCI Liason at
1:132/300.12. We are particularly interested in tracing sources of
illegal keys being generated for our products such as FrontDoor.

We will investigate the complaints (as we have done in the past), and
make a determination on what actions if any, we will pursue. The
actions can include policy complaints to NC and NECs, license
revocation pursuant to the terms of our licensing, and litigation.
Online Communications Inc. has retained the services of legal staff,
and has created the position of OCI Liason to pursue copyright
infringement of our products.

We regret having to write a letter such as this. We have many hundreds
of legitimate, and legal users of our products. However, software
piracy and copyright infringement costs U.S. companies an estimated
$2 billion annually according to the Software Publisher's Association.
Online Communications will pursue all avenues to limit its exposure to
the illegal use of our products.

If as a user, you are in doubt about a specific use of any of our
products as it pertains to the license you have acquired, please
contact Online Communications Inc., or James Smith directly through
netmail at 1:132/300 or 1:132/301, or "OCI Liason" at 1:132/300.12.

Information regarding the registration of FrontDoor shareware and
commercial purchase can be obtained by file requesting REGFORM.USA and
ONLINE.EXE respectively.

Sincerely,
James Smith

Please put this in Fido news
Dear Editor,

Well I have been following the events that have transpired thru your
excellent coverage in the Fido news, and I have to finally say that I
agree with the 600 nodes that have decided not to accept the bullying
theatrics of there new NC and there RC and ZC.  I personally belive
that the Policy 4 of Fido-net needs to be re-worked, so the power is
in a bottom up type configuration.  I would say let the Nodes in the
Net pick the NC and have power over him, let the NC's pick the RC'S
and have power over them, let the RC'S Pick the ZC's and have power
over them ect... ect... The one tru problem I have seen is that the
power structer in Fido-Net rest to much in the upper parts of it.  So
let us reorganize it, and make it more enjoyable for all.

Sincerly
Jon Taylor

THE S.C. ITALIAN FIDOBUST: SIX MONTHS LATER

              THE S.C. ITALIAN FIDOBUST: SIX MONTHS LATER
              ===========================================
                     Pietropaolo Bianchi, 2:331/307
                          Former NC331 (93-94)

The so called "Italian Fidobust" was not aimed at FidoNet per se after
all. Six months later, we have a better appreciation of the whole
picture. And before anything else is said, rest assured the Fido
community worldwide: Italian Fidonet has NEVER been zeroed, as I read
somewhere on Fidonews. Shocked of course and maybe made wiser, but
always adherent to the old Heinleinian motto that "the routes must
roll". Mailflow never really stopped. We are again some 400 active
nodes now, a cooperative, smoothly running region overall.

Let me recall the facts. On May 11, 1994, 122 patrols of the "Guardia
di Finanza", the financial branch of italian police, knocked at the
door of 122 people, mostly but not exclusively Fido sysops or
cosysops, in execution of a confiscation warrant issued by the until
then unheard-of Chief Prosecutor at Pesaro (nice town of central
Italy), Dr. Gaetano Savoldelli-Pedrocchi.

The police at Pesaro, within an investigation about prostitution, had
observed a heavy going-and-coming of young males from a flat in center
town. They had rushed in, only to discover a full software piracy
business run by some two Mr. Paolorosso and Mr. Cardinali.  Thousands
of labeled and properly inventorized floppies in cartons, label
FidoNews 11-44                 Page:  7                    31 Oct 1994

printers, Amigas, PCs, and the like. Among the "like", a modem, a
Telix (unregisterd copy) and alas, a Telix dialing directory.

The Telix dialing directory was the Ariadne's thread that drove
Prosecutor Savoldelli's squads in the homes of 122 hobbyists all over
Italy in search of accomplices. The warrant cited the possibility that
the two pirates acted "together with unknowns" to circulate pirated
software, and it imposed to police to "sequester anything apt to the
purpose" found at the domiciles of the indagated people.

You could have had your BBS called by those two pirates, and
automagically you became a suspect pirate too, you got visited by
Police, and you had your system sealed and taken away. The large scale
of the action forced the police to recruit for the mission any even
vaguely computer-literate agent (i.e., able enough to distinguish a
printer from a stove). As it quickly became evident, the average
knowledgeability of the recuited cop turned out to be not up to
the purpose, giving rise to funny and not-so-funny anecdotes.

Paolo Borghesi, 2:331/204, a well mannered teenager student of
Brescia, had his sleeping room sealed for a few days until the
policemen could make their way ahead of it. All too often Mummy had
told him "Paolo make order in all this mess".

Alfredo Persivale, 2:331/302, the owner of a mechanical factory in
Buccinasco, ran his BBS over a LAN connecting his firm's
administration computers. The whole information system at his plants
was put under seal and taken away. He purchased a stock of ballpens
and frantically started billing his clients by hand.

Giulio Cipriani, 2:331/344, had everything electronically-looking in
his home sequestered: computer, modems, CDROM reader and CDROMs,
mouse, mousepad, mouse cover, power outlet extension and allegedly, an
answering machine.

Max Berni, 2:332/301, a prepossessing summer beach-beau in Rimini,
whose messages used to be written all guts and nuts, had his system
totally sequestered. Following the shock, as soon as he could lay
hands on a backup system, his messages regained a totally unexpected
logical sense, grammar smoothness and overall readability.

Mario Mure', NC332, ran his host on an Amiga. The cops were reported
as watching puzzled to his system, trying to issue some infruitful
"dir" commands, and eventually taking away everything. His NEC took
over him in polling the other NCs the very same night.

Walter Mascarin, 2:331/323, was among the happy few visited by
knowledgeable policemen. They came, saw, extensively searched, found
nothing, went away leaving him with his system intact and a receipt of
search performed.

Dozens of stories like the above were reported from all corners of the
country, all pointing to policemen generally quite polite but not
quite competent, with a generalized "take away now, control later"
approach.
FidoNews 11-44                 Page:  8                    31 Oct 1994


Fidonet being the major amateur network in Italy, if only for
statistical reasons Fido nodes (about 30-35: a 10% of the italian net)
were the most often struck, thence the popular term "fidobust".
However, also co-sysops and points were reportedly visited, and to a
lesser degree, non-fido sysops.

The region shivered when rumors ran that this wasn't but the first
wave of the attack, and that from the logs of the inquired nodes a
chain reaction would ensue. A couple of me-too type inquiries soon
after the major Fidobust, hitting half a dozen nodes in Turin and one
in Taranto (the latter action possibly politically biased against the
leftist host of the "Peacelink" Net), strenghtened this impression.

On the other hand, a few truly pirate, alternet boards, were
surprisingly spared by the first hit. They were reported as having
spontaneously "crashed" soon thereafter, though.

The busting of many honest nodes and the sparing of some pirate boards
seemed to somewhat substantiate the early claims of a few radicals,
that behind the attack lay an obscure manoeuvre primarily aimed at
wiping off free amateur telematics, rather than against piracy.

The contemporary announcement by Olivetti, the major computer
manufacturer in Italy, that they would set up a nationwide telematic
service named "Italia Online", and the deepest involvement of Italian
Prime Mininster and television tycoon Mr. Berlusconi in the
information media market, made such suspicions, exaggerate they might
seem, not theoretically unfounded.

So far however no clue of any kind has been reported to substantiate
such allegations. Six months after its announcement, Italia Online is
still offline, and the roughness of the attack has been definitely
ascribed to a poor choice of objectives and methods by the inquirers,
who even partially admitted them.

A parliament official interrogation on the hit was immediately asked
by some radical MP's. Prosecutor Savoldelli kept a press conference to
explain the operation. Newspapers and magazines reported on the facts.

In this climate, a few sysops definitely pulled the plug. Among them
former R33 Founder and long time RC33, Giorgio Rutigliano, who
declared: by no means whatever pleasure i can draw from amateur
fidonetting balances the risk of being seized by the police. I always
have been fully legal and have promoted the fullest legality in the
net, and don't deserve this. Amateur telematics game has definitely
gone out of control.

But for the few who left, the other sysops held on tighter to the
RC33, Giancarlo Cairella, who had truly hard days acting as a relay of
news and counsels, together with the other *C's and with an attorney
sysop. Routes were redesigned where necessary, and mailflow promptly
resumed everywhere. Alternets, who had always blamed italian Fidonet
as being "obsessive with rules and paranoid about legal issues", got
duly frightened and somewhat looked for reapprochment. An "all
FidoNews 11-44                 Page:  9                    31 Oct 1994

networks' sysops" conference was established.

Over the time, our Region has regained "normality". After examination,
one after another, the sequestered systems are being given back to
their operators, and messages of the latter restart popping out in the
net. Current hot topics have returned to technics, such as V.34
modems, ISDN services and Internet connectivity, about which people
are truly going crazy.

But in the depth something has changed.

We no longer regard ourselves telematicians as a "lucky island" where
real life and outer people won't reach. Legal issues are no longer
perceived as moral obligations and policy agreements of ours own, but
as very material constraints instead. We are fully aware that the
fellow sysops seized by police, though having had their materials
restituted, may still undergo a process whose outcome nobody can
foresee. The law on software and telematics piracy is too recent with
little or no antecedents. The only sure thing, whichever the outcome,
will be the legal expenses every seized sysop will have to sustain, in
the USD 1000 range.

On the broader picture, we have become aware of the need for a good
legislation on BBS. If being listed on a dialing directory is enough
to get inquired, we definitely want a law to back us up. Fido merry
times when we described ourselves as a loosely organized anarchy kept
together by the nodelist were great times, but for us they are over.

We need to know where our responsibilities begin and where they end,
what to do with users and uploaders, if we are forced to surely
identify them or not, and if so, how. We want to know from law
scholars if not reading in transit mail makes us liable of omitted
vigilance, or if reading it makes us liable of privacy violation. We
ask clearcut criteria for allowing or not allowing crypted messages,
we want to know who's is the final responsibility for echomail
offending messages, and so on.

The benefit of all this clash is that our debates now go beyond the
rather futile "long signature" and "commercial message" issues, and
attain to some more basic rights, and profounder questions. Our story
made noise, and together with other social and political organizations
we are given the opportunity to influence the establishment of a good
law on telematic messaging, and we'll work on this.

The debate is running and we will be glad to share our conclusions
with the rest of fidonet community when we reach consensus or obtain
some favourable legislation.

Hello folks;

On 7 September I asked the interim ZEC to organize the selection of a
new ZEC, using whatever process the 10 RECs felt was appropriate.

The RECs published in Fidonews the procedure they planned to follow,
and held an election.  After voting, no one candidate obtained more
than 50% of the ballots cast.  The run-off election resulted in a tie
vote. Copies of all ballots have been forwarded to me by Dave James of
1:209/209 who collected the ballots.

I have carefully reviewed the procedure followed, and have consulted
with both candidates and with the interim ZEC. Since no one conceded
and the candidates agreed to abide by my decision, I set about looking
at other factors that might help decide the outcome. Amongst other
things, I looked at which candidate obtained the most votes on the
first ballot, and, asked for input from the 3 Zone Hubs.

No matter how I approached the decision all indicators pointed to one
individual. I am pleased to announce the appointment of Bruce Bodger,
1:170/400, as the new ZEC for Zone 1. Bruce and I will be discussing
his duties as they relate to Fidonet and to the ZEC position, and we
will make a joint statement in the near future to outline how the Z1EC
functions and interacts with the Z1C and Fidonet in general.

Please give Bruce your support and cooperation in his new and arduous
task.

Of course, my thanks goes out to all those who participated in the
process, the candidates, the voters, and Dave James for counting the
ballots... Special thanks to Adrian Walker for taking on the thankless
task of interim ZEC, and performing admirably.

        FIRST BALLOT

        Martin Belcke        232/16             4 votes
        Bruce Bodger         170/400            5 votes
        David Calafrancesco  2624/306           0 votes
        Steve Cross          123/19             1 vote
        Ed Propes            2215/470           0 votes

Since no one candidate received more than 50% of votes cast, the RECs
were presented with a ballot containing the names of the two nominees
having the most votes, as provided for in the election rules, and they
conducted a runoff election.

        FINAL BALLOT

        Martin Belcke        232/16             5 votes
        Bruce Bodger         170/400            5 votes

The ZC was then asked to select the next Z1EC from the above two
candidates, and he has announced the appointment of Bruce Bodger,
1:170/400, as the new ZEC for Zone 1.

FidoNet: Breakdown Of The Infrastructure

Currently, there is an ongoing debate as to  whether  or  not  Planet
Connect  and  other systems have the right and/or authority to filter
messages that contain what most people consider, "obscene  language".
Through the use of a program called, "NoBogus", mail handling systems
are afforded the ability of scanning through incoming mail packets to
determine  if  duplication  loops  exist,  as  well  as scan for user
defined "obscene strings".  When these and other criterion  are  met,
the  program (NoBogus) will toss the mail packets out of the cycle as
if they never exsited.  The  idea  of  duplicate  reduction  is  well
founded since many systems send and receive from multiple systems and
the concept of "Sole Source" send/receive mail HUBs does not exist as
a  reality.   Under  these  provisions, a system is only permitted to
send and receive from a dedicated system.  Correspondingly, a session
level  password  is utilized to prevent unauthorized connections from
those whom would attempt such.  When Planet Connect first  came  into
being,  the  original  land line based backbone declared that any and
all mail received from Planet Connect  must  be  returned  to  Planet
FidoNews 11-44                 Page: 12                    31 Oct 1994

Connect.   As  grievous  as  this  may  have first sounded, it is now
apparent that there was a method in there madness.  At nearly 80%  of
market coverage, Planet Connect and two other systems now function as
backbone providers or they really represent passthru systems?

Passthru systems are not required to carrying any material they elect
not to carry.  Subsequently, they may employ the use of such programs
as NoBogus to censor mail to their liking.  Fair enough, but where do
the  Moderators of the echos come into focus?  Are they not empowered
as totalitarian beings within the confines of their  own  echos?   If
Planet  Connect  has  the  blanket autonomy under the guidelines of a
passthru system, to censor mail, then in effect, are they  not  truly
the  people  in charge of the echo?  Since they are now supplying the
vast majority of systems in the United States alone, should not  they
be  considered  more  as  Fidonet  providers  and be forced to follow
established guidlines of mail distribution?

Fidonet establishes  backbone  echos  and  distributes  them  in  the
Fidonet.Na file.  These echos were generally designed by hobbyists to
communicate with others of similar interests.  If the Moderator of  a
given echo elects to allow "obscene language" into his/her echo, then
who among us has the implied authority to mandate otherwise  once  an
echo  has  been  sanctioned  by  the Zone Echo Coordinator?  Passthru
status gives Planet Connect and the other two service providers  this
authority under the provisions of Fidonet Policy 4 which states;

; 2.1.5  No Alteration of Routed Mail
;
; You may not modify, other than as required for routing or other
; technical purposes, any message, netmail or echomail, passing through
; the system from one FidoNet node to another.  If you are offended by
; the content of a message, the procedure described in section 2.1.7
; must be used.
;
; \
; |  Sections Deleted Fro Brevity
; /
;
; 2.1.7  Not Routing Mail
;
;
; You are not required to route traffic if you have not  agreed  to  do
; so.   You  are not obligated to route traffic for all if you route it
; for any, unless you hold a Network  Coordinator  or  Hub  Coordinator
; position.   Routing  traffic  through a node not obligated to perform
; routing without the permission of that node may be annoying behavior.
; This includes unsolicited echomail.
;
; If you do not forward a message when you previously agreed to perform
; such routing, the message must be returned to the sysop of  the  node
; at  which  it  entered  FidoNet with an explanation of why it was not
; forwarded.  (It  is  not  necessary  to  return  messages  which  are
; addressed   to  a  node  which  is  not  in  the  current  nodelist.)
; Intentionally stopping an in-transit message without  following  this
; procedure constitutes annoying behavior.  In the case of a failure to
FidoNews 11-44                 Page: 13                    31 Oct 1994

; forward traffic due to  a  technical  problem,  it  does  not  become
; annoying unless it persists after being pointed out to the sysop.

I spoke to Boyd Goodin of Planet Systems who stated that *he* was not
the  decision maker in the selection of messages to be cut, rather he
was contacted by the other two mail  stars  and  asked  if  he  would
participate  in their efforts to control the content of messages. The
reason stated for this action was that downlinks  complained  of  the
vulgarity  of  certain echos. Again I asked you; Who is in control of
an Echo on the  backbone-  the  Moderator,  Planet  Connect,  or  the
whining downlink?

In addition to the problem with defining responsibilies of action for
the global level of  mail  transfers,  the  local  area  network  are
suffering  from  a  similar  situation.  At the micro-level (HUBs and
subsequent downlinks) the program (NoBogus) is being  used  to  strip
messages  from  packets that the system operator feels will be killed
when they eventually reach their destination at Planet Connect.  When
one  system  is  chosen  to  feed  the mail to an entire network, his
position also gives him the same umbrella of protection  defined  for
passthru system, to censor mail.

I  submit  that  we are in the process of seeing our hobby taken away
from us by by commercial enterprises.  At  present,  their  immediate
structure  affords  them  the  luxury of now being in the negotiation
seat for power.  How could any of the  *C  structure  approach  these
systems  and  mandate  any  form  of  control  over their activities?
Remember when simple cable TV did not  charge  for  local  television
channels?   The  Internet  is  too  large to bridle, but Fidonet is a
prime  cut  for  any  enterprise  that  wants  to  come   along   and
commercialize  its already existing user base.  Is this possibly what
we are seeing take place? Has the convenience  of  a  single  service
made   system  operators  complacent  to  the  point  that  they  are
essentially blinded to what is going on around them?

The *C structure needs to fall back  and  regroup  lest  they  become
token  pawns in an inevitable outcome.  Echomail and Fidonet policies
should be combined under one set of standards.  Local area *Cs should
be  required  to  enforce  the  "Sole  Source"  distribution in their
respective areas. And  last  but  certainly  not  least;  systems  in
positions  of  HUBs and Distribution sites should be combined under a
set of standards which prohibit the interference of  mail.  When  the
word  "Fuck"  has  disappeared  from the Fidonet vocabulary, the word
"Damn"  will  soon  be  its  replacement.   How  long  is  it  before
ideological differences warrant mail censorship?

It's  not  only  your  hobby  that  is  threatened  - it is you basic
American rights to freedom of speech that is being threatened!

Subj: BLOWHARDS Echo Rules for Blowhards

Background:

BLOWHARDS is a non-Backbone Echo distributed via past or present
members for the purpose of microdebating non-important non-issues by
self-appointed 'sealawyer-type' Sysops of FidoNet most of whom have
recently migrated into FidoNet from military bases or walks of life
where personal power was denied to them.

This Echo serves to relieve the crap level from the real Echos [like
ZEC  or  MODERATOR]  where  nitpickers  previously plied their
dissatisfaction with FidoNet and real world ops.

It is modeled on on a previous and similarly designed local Echo
called R18COORD which was a circular flame Echo for dissatisfied Net
Coordinators in Region 18 to bitch and moan about standard FidoNet
ops they didn't agree with.

Blowhards are concentrated in New Jersey but are also found in Texas,
Maryland, Delaware, Oklahoma, and Alabama among others. You probably
have Blowhards in your own Net. Most Nets do.

Blowhards  can  be  identified  in  FidoNet  Echos  by  their
self-referential and circularly reinforcing rhetorical style as well
as the number of ad hominems per Echo message. Masters of the 'Big
Lie' school of revisionist history, Blowhards seldom recognize
themselves even upon detection and notification.

Now, this is their own Echo to pollute and in which they may be
blissfully content to continue fantacizing they have any inkling of
what FidoNet is or does. [But don't count on it.]

Rules:

1. Blowhards always pontificate and expound in circles so please try
  to be circumspect and self-referential. Get your fellow Blowhards
  to repeat your 'thoughts' as if they were facts many times.

2. Blowhards always use personal attack by preference over facts or
  logic so please try to be rude and nonsensical.

3. Blowhards always complain about the work other folks do but never
  do any work of their own so please tear down the efforts of others.

4. Blowhards always claim to be 'protecting Sysops' or 'protecting
  FidoNet' from 'power mongers and control freaks' while acting just
  like power mongers and control freaks so please make authoritative
  pronouncements in the name of 'saving' FidoNet from the people who
  do the actual work of FidoNet.

5. Blowhards always create more traffic and perpetuate more arguments
  than normal Sysops so please argue for the sake of seeing your name
  in print and please cross-post all your traffic to at least four
FidoNews 11-44                 Page: 15                    31 Oct 1994

  more Echos that have nothing to do with the current subject being
  argued.

6. Blowhards always whine about other folks whining so always pretend
  to be injured whenever called about your own whining.

7. Blowhards always claim Policy is the be-all and end-all in FidoNet
  and discount the spirit of cooperation and friendliness FidoNet is
  actually based on so please cite actual and imagined Policy sections
  regardless of applicability to the subject at hand while doing all
  you can from keeping any real Policy changes or adjustments from
  occurring.

8. Blowhards perseverate at all times over trivial items so please
  remember to ignore any corrections or substance in replies and stick
  to belaboring points that are irrelevant to any discussion.

9. Blowhards have no concept of humor, its application, or its useage
  so please take every indication of humor in the traffic of others
  as a deliberate and cynical attempt to personally wound you.

10. Blowhards don't know they are Blowhards so please use this Echo as
  soon as it is pointed out to you by a normal Sysop that you belong
  in the BLOWHARDS Echo.

Anyone who posts reasonable or logical traffic in this Echo will
receive endless warnings until their access is suddenly revoked one
day without notice. Anyone who complains about this Echo elsewhere
will be sent here because they obviously belong here.

The Moderator of this Echo will be soley responsible for every
Blowhard that posts here and will be determined by message volume and
vitriol.

Welcome, Blowhards, to your new home.

P.S. Look for the new BLOWHARD nodelist to be issued beginning on
   Julian day 301. It will contain many of your favorite Blowhards.
