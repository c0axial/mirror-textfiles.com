                      QUESTIONS CONCERNING FIDONET

     Do you believe that FidoNet should be used to promote
     international communications and good-will?

     Do you believe that FidoNet should be used to assist a wide
     variety of charitable concerns?

     Do you wish to enjoy more communications-oriented and ancillary
     services?

     Do you wish to reduce the size of your monthly phone bill?

     Do you believe that FidoNet's future directions should be decided
     not by a few but democratically by all those concerned?

     Do you think that FidoNet should be a place of fair treatment,
     justice and respect for one another?

     Do you want to see an end to the squabbling and confusion and see
     everyone turn their attention toward making FidoNet all that it
     can be?

     Do you believe that FidoNet should be protected from adverse
     outside influences?

     Do you believe that the financial burden of supporting FidoNet
     should be borne by others than sysops only?


     If you have answered "Yes" to any of the questions above, you
     have a reason for joining and supporting IFNA.  IFNA supports and
     is working for implementation of all those ideals stated above.

     There is a popular misconception that IFNA is some outside
     agency, come to wrest control of FidoNet from those that are
     currently running it.  In fact, nothing could be further from the
     truth.  The Coordinator Structure was originally created by past
     and present leaders of IFNA.  It is fully supported by IFNA which
     recognizes the benefits of maintaining the current separation of
     responsibilities wherein the operational concerns are handled by
     the coordinators while the IFNA structures deal with all the
     political considerations.  Efforts are underway now on both sides
     to jointly define the limits of responsibility of the respective
     bodies and the details of the necessary interfaces between them.

     Nearly every Regional Coordinator has, by joining IFNA, stated a
     recognition of the need for the political organization that IFNA
     can provide for representing FidoNet's interests with all outside
     agencies and for making sure that FidoNet is responsive to the
     needs and will of all, not just a few.

     Who are the leaders of FidoNet who have not become members of
     IFNA?  Not very many.  And why?  Because those diligently working
     to serve FidoNet recognize that there are many potential benefits
     to be gained for FidoNet from such an organization.  That's
     certainly not to say that everyone agrees on what those benefits
     should be or how they should be attained, but IFNA still provides
     the structure and rules that presently allow the greatest chance
     for these and similar questions to be resolved.

     Have you noticed that Tom Jennings, the "Father of FIdoNet" is
     not only an IFNA member and supporter, but has also charged IFNA
     with executing his long-standing principles of promoting FidoNet
     for the good of all that would use and serve it well?  Who do you
     think TJ supports - those that are trying to make the most out of
     the many opportunities that IFNA offers FidoNet or those that
     would cripple or destroy it?  On which side are you?

     If you are a sysop that cares about FidoNet's future and
     believes in all the benefits that so many can can derive from
     it, you owe it to them, yourself, and those that have already
     committed so much to FidoNet, to take full advantage of the
     opportunities IFNA provides:

       o  Leadership - If you have ideas of what FidoNet should be,
          IFNA provides you many positions from which you can promote
          them.

       o  Representation - If you can't participate directly, you can
          utilize the various democratic processes of IFNA to still
          have your concerns and ideas heard and acted upon.

       o  Optimization - By pooling resources and talents you can
          optimize the efforts of yourself and others towards whatever
          aspects of the common good you choose.

       o  Fellowship - By forgoing a contentious position and joining
          in with fellow sysops actively trying to solve current
          problems and meet future needs, you should share a greater
          understanding and respect.  And the fun should come back.

     If you don't accept IFNA as simply a tool that you can manipulate
     to accomplish what you want for FidoNet, then you are cheating
     yourself and all of FidoNet.

     New EchoMail Conference: OS/9?
     Robert Heller @ Locks-Hill-BBS.NA.FIDONET (1:322/410.0)

         I am looking for other people who are interested in the OS/9
     operating system, particularly the 68000 version.  I have two
     68K systems: an Atari 1040ST (running TOS and OS/9-68000 V2.2)
     and a Stride 440 (running CP/M-68K V1.2).  OS/9 is a somewhat
     UNIX-like operating system, but smaller and saner.  It was
     originally written for the Radio Shack ColorComputer (a
     6809-based BASIC-in-ROM toy), but has been ported to the 68000
     family, including the Atari ST series.  I plan to port it to my
     Stride 440 this summer.

         If you are interested in carrying an OS/9 echo, please
     contact me via NetMail.

     Fredric L. Rice
     (103/503.3 - Astro-Net)


     There is a program  which allows the  operator to  symbolically
     move objects within a two  dimensional representation of a grid
     whose dimensions are usually one hundred by one hundred points.
     Working  within  these limits, the  object is moved  from point
     to point searching  for  other  objects by  employing a limited
     field of vision. This program, if you haven't  already guessed,
     is the old Star Trek game.

     Variations  tried  years after  the initial  release, after the
     newness of hunting down defenseless Klingons and  reducing them
     to numeric rubble, included the movement  of the searching ship
     within a  three dimensional  model,  usually cubic though there
     have been spherical implementations which were experimentations
     on various search patterns within a limited volume while trying
     to maintain a distance from the limits at velocity.

     Within this article I have described the  numerical methodology
     and formula for  performing  symbolic  movement  within  a  two
     dimensional  and three dimensional  grid  of infinity  sans one
     grid points, (which means that no limit detection code has been
     included).

     We will use the "Galileian system of co-ordinates"  to describe
     grid points along lines, squares, and cubes.  Because we are to
     work in an almost-infinite model,  we will call the "Center" of
     the model our point of  reference. Though we will not encompass
     a limitation of visibility, we will restrict the number of grid
     points worked  with to usually  nine  in  the  two  dimensional
     models and usually  27 within the three dimensional models. One
     dimensional concepts will not be tolerated within this article.

     - -

     Two Dimensional movements within a grid:

     Let us suppose that you are standing at Galileian position 2, 2
     in a grid of 3 by 3 points, (referred to as  x position 2 and y
     position 2, or simply  xpos 2 and  ypos 2 from now on). You are
     standing at this position and wish to  translate your  position
     into another by applying movement towards another point. (Let's
     further assume that movement between  points is illegal in this
     universe as that is another article).

     Before applying numerical  formula  to progress  from  point to
     point, let's lay down out simple two dimensional model and then
     apply relative values to them:

                             1,1  1,2  1,3
                             2,1  2,2  2,3
                             3,1  3,2  3,3

     We consider ourself to be at xpos 2 and ypos 2.  Now let's apply
     FidoNews 5-17                Page 5                   25 Apr 1988


     the relative numerical values to use to these points:

                          -1,-1  -1,+0  -1,+1
                          +0,-1  +0,+0  +0,+1
                          +1,-1  +1,+0  +1,+1

     If we wish to apply  direction of travel, we would  assign each
     grid point reference a number; perhaps like this:

                        1          2           3
                          -1,-1  -1,+0  -1,+1
                       4  +0,-1  +0,+0  +0,+1   6
                          +1,-1  +1,+0  +1,+1
                        7          8           9

     To move towards direction 1,  we take current xpos minus 1, the
     current ypos minus 1, and there we are.  2-1 = 1 and 2-1 = 1 so
     the final translation yields 1,1, where we wish to be.

     Another example might be to travel towards direction 7 where we
     take current xpos plus 1 and current ypos minus 1.  2+1 = 3 and
     2-1 = 1 so the final translation offers 3,1.

     If no movement along a dimension is required, such as is moving
     towards direction 6,  we take  current xpos  plus 0 and current
     ypos plus 1. Yield is 2+0 = 2 and 2+1 = 3 or 2,3.

     Simple enough;  now let's apply  "distance"  to move using  the
     same model:

     Let's move outside the model towards direction 6 for a distance
     of four. To do such, simply multiply the reference grid by four
     to yield the proper offsets to center:

     At direction 6, 0 times 4 = 0 and 1  times four = 4.  Apply the
     current xpos of 2+4x0 = 2 and  current ypos of 2+4*1 = 6,  or a
     new  grid  reference  of  2,6.  We  can  make  verification  by
     expanding out the model if you wish:

                         1,1  1,2  1,3  1,4  1,5  1,6
                         2,1  2,2  2,3  2,4  2,5  2,6
                         3,1  3,2  3,3  3,4  3,5  3,6

     From 2,2 towards direction 6 for 4 points you get 2,6.

     A simple way, then, to represent such movement within a game is
     to put your reference grid into an array:

             dim reference%(9)
             for rloop% = 1 to 9
                read reference%(rloop%)
             next rloop%
             data -1,-1,-1,0,-1,1
             data  0,-1, 0,0, 0,1
             data  1,-1, 1,0, 1,1

     FidoNews 5-17                Page 6                   25 Apr 1988


     To move from current xpos, ypos to new xpos, ypos, for a number
     of grid points "distance" in direction  "direction"  would then
     be:

     xpos = xpos + (reference%(((direction - 1) * 2) + 1) * distance)

     ypos = ypos + (reference%(((direction - 1) * 2) + 2) * distance)

     Note that by performing the above formula from a near-edge grid
     point, you may leave the model by allowing new xpos and ypos to
     go negative or exceed the desired limits if any.

     For   the   non-programmers   among   FidoNet;   direction   is
     decremented  and  then   multiplied by two.   The   result   is
     incremented and  the result is used to index into the  array to
     acquire the reference information.  That value is multiplied by
     the  distance  which  is then  added  to the current xpos.  The
     calculation of the ypos is much  the same yet  two is  added to
     the index when acquiring the reference value from the array.

     A current xpos of 2 and ypos of 2,  towards  direction  6 for a
     distance of four could then be calculated as:

      direction - 1 = 5
              5 * 2 = 10
             10 + 1 = 11
     reference%(11) = 0
       0 * distance = 0
           xpos + 0 = 2 or a new xpos of 2

      direction - 1 = 5
              5 * 2 = 10
             10 + 2 = 12
     reference%(12) = 1
       1 * distance = 4
           ypos + 4 = 6 or a new ypos of 6

     - -

     Three dimensional movements within a cube:

     Visualization  of   the  reference  grid   created   for  three
     dimensional movements is  a little    more   complicated so the
     models drawn here are  done in a  three-tiered  or  three-level
     method.  There will,  however, be an additional convention used
     and that is ypos to represent the additional dimension.

     To represent movement from  enter out to  all other points will
     require 81 reference points where "Center"  is considered to be
     point 2,2,2 using Galileian system of co-ordinates:


               1,1,1  1,2,1  1,3,1
               2,1,1  2,2,1  2,3,1
               3,1,1  3,2,1  3,3,1

     FidoNews 5-17                Page 7                   25 Apr 1988


                      1,1,2  1,2,2  1,3,2
                      2,1,2  2,2,2  2,3,2
                      3,1,2  3,2,2  3,3,2

                             1,1,3  1,2,3  1,3,3
                             2,1,3  2,2,3  2,3,3
                             3,1,3  3,2,3  3,3,3

     Again, lets apply  numeric values  to each grid point so that a
     since of direction may be applied when moving from 2,2,2 to all
     other points:

             1          2          3
               1,1,1  1,2,1  1,3,1
           4   2,1,1  2,2,1  2,3,1   6
               3,1,1  3,2,1  3,3,1
             7          8          9

                   10         11           12
                      1,1,2  1,2,2  1,3,2
                 13   2,1,2  2,2,2  2,3,2   15
                      3,1,2  3,2,2  3,3,2

     To apply  reference points for  this  model,  let's  change the
     rules just a little. Rather than applying -1, +1,  and 0 to the
     model, lets  simply  apply the  symbols - + and o respectively:
     (Well it saves paper...):

                       +-- +o- ++-
                       o-- oo- o+-
                       --- -o- -+-

                           +-o +oo ++o
                           o-o ooo o+o
                           --o -oo -+o

                               +-+ +o+ +++
                               o-+ oo+ o++
                               --+ -o+ -++

     As with the two dimensional  model, practical applications in a
     program would look something like this:

             dim reference%(81)
             for rloop% = 1 to 81
                read reference%(rloop%)
             next rloop%
             data  1,-1,-1,  1,0,-1,  1,1,-1
             data  0,-1,-1,  0,0,-1,  0,1,-1

             data -1,-1,-1, -1,0,-1, -1,1,-1
             data             1,-1,0,  1,0,0,  1,1,0
             data             0,-1,0,  0,0,0,  0,1,0
             data            -1,-1,0, -1,0,0, -1,1,0
             data                      1,-1,1,   1,0,1,  1,1,1
             data                      0,-1,1,   0,0,1,  0,1,1
             data                      -1,-1,1, -1,0,1, -1,1,1

     By progressing the  above formula used to  move  from center to
     another grid point, we can assume the following:

     xpos = xpos + (reference%(((direction - 1) * 3) + 1) * distance)

     ypos = ypos + (reference%(((direction - 1) * 3) + 2) * distance)

     zpos = zpos + (reference%(((direction - 1) * 3) + 3) * distance)


     (Notice that this time,  the number  of the multiplier has been
     changed from 2 to 3 to represent the number of dimensions).

     Though a good cube can not be  drawn here with all  of the grid
     points referenced, we can still apply the formula.

     Assume a  current xpos of  2, ypos of 2, and zpos of 2. Further
     assume a direction of 22 for a simple distance  of one, (make a
     reference  to  the above  model to  see  that the result should
     equal 2,1,3). Here we will be moving in two directions within a
     three dimensional grid matrix.

      direction - 1 = 21
             21 * 3 = 63
             63 + 1 = 64
     reference%(64) = 0
       0 * distance = 0
           xpos + 0 = 2 or a new xpos of 2

      direction - 1 = 21
             21 * 3 = 63
             63 + 2 = 65
     reference%(65) = -1
      -1 * distance = -1
          ypos + -1 = 1 or a new ypos of 1

      direction - 1 = 21
             21 * 3 = 63
             63 + 3 = 66
     reference%(66) = 1
       1 * distance = 1
           zpos + 1 = 3 or a new zpos of 3


     By "stacking" dimensional reference offsets in this way, we may
     acquire simple  movements  among any  number  of  dimensions. I
     would invite a  fourth dimensional progression on this theme to
     be documented and  posted to FidoNews by the readers interested

     to see if  an  elegant solution  can be developed to create the
     array.  Anyone interested  might look  into providing  a matrix
     rather than an array.

     1:107/211
                      New Discounts for IFNA Members

     The following two items are available to registered members of
     IFNA (or the IEEE) at substantial discounts:

     1.  The Touchbase Systems WorldPort 2400 Portable Modem

         This modem comes with both an AC adapter and a 9-volt battery
         which will power it for approximately six hours.  Roughly the
         size of a package of cigarettes, this engineering marvel
         supports the extended Hayes AT command set and is compatible
         with Bell 103/212A and CCITT V.21/V.22/V.22bis.  It has a
         built in speaker, four call monitoring LEDs, special acoustic
         coupler adapter cable, 25-pin female DB-25 connector, and a
         standard RJ-11C modular connector telephone line interface.
         It has substituted for a Hayes 2400 on this BBS with no
         changes or problems.  Bundled in this offer is CARBON COPY
         PLUS version 4.0 which provides both a terminal emulator
         program and a Remote PC Operation capabilty in the same
         package.  GREAT for lap-tops!

         List price for this modem is $395 (CARBON COPY lists for $195
         alone).  Both are available to IFNA members for $216 plus any
         applicable taxes and shipping charge.


     2.  The CAT Image Scanner Model SI

         This scanner package was a hit at the recent Computer
         Graphics Show in New York City.  It attaches to your printer
         and is driven by the print mechanism to capture 50 to 300 dpi
         images in either Line Art or Half-tone modes.  Scanned images
         can be cropped, scaled, printed, or combined to make posters,
         T-shirts, or viewgraphs.  Captured images can be converted
         into PCX, TIFF or PFF print formats for use by various
         graphic packages or you can do your own desktop publishing
         with any word processor package.  Listing for $195, this item
         is available to IFNA members for $126, plus shipping/taxes.

         Printers supported:  Panasonic KX-P1080, 1091, 1092
         Epson MX 80/100, RX 80/100, JX 80, FX 80/100, FX 85/182
         FX 86/286, Fx 86e/286e, EX 800/100, LQ 800/1000

     For more information on these items see pages 52 and 317 of the
     April 26, 1988 edition of PC magazine (the one that reviews 9600
     baud modems) or send a msg with your voice phone number and
     address to 1:107/211.  Supplies are limited, so don't delay!

     THE TREASURER'S REPORT  Part II?
     --------------------------------

     A few of you may recognize my name, with its trailing initials,
     as that of the treasurer of International Fidonet Association,
     Inc. (IFNA), but today I write as Leonard Mednick, JAS (Just
     Another Sysop)!  Right now I'm reminded of an experience I had
     when I was in the third grade of elementary school.


     THUMP! THUMP! THUMP!

     Things were moving just a tad too slowly for me that day.  The
     teacher, whom I dearly adored, just wasn't reaching me at the
     moment so I did the most logical thing I could think of, and
     that was to bang my head against my desk.  THUMP!  THUMP!
     THUMP!  <pause>  THUMP!  THUMP!  THUMP!

     "Leonard," my beloved teacher announced, "Did you ever notice
     that the emptiest heads make the loudest noise?"

     Everyone in class focused on me.  There were giggles and there
     was laughter.  How I loathed my school chums. How I disliked my
     former academic paramour for heaping me with this shame and
     ridicule.  And how I hated myself, for getting trapped with all
     this contempt.

     What a lesson I learned from school that day.  "Empty heads make
     the loudest noise!"  And its corollary, "Engage brain before
     putting mouth in gear!"


     ELECTRON THUMPING

     Which brings me to the point of this missive.  There's been a lot
     of ELECTRON THUMPING, lately and it doesn't sound like the result
     of brain engagements.

     OK.  You guys wanted an accounting.  And an accounting you got in
     the form of a SUMMARY of the accounts for the year ending
     12/31/87.  Just like every other entity that reports to its
     members, stockholders, or THE IRS.  How do you expect IFNA or
     any other company, etc. to report to EACH of its constituents?
     Do you expect a copy of the check register, the general ledger,
     and all the other books and workpapers to be UPLOADED to each of
     you?  Or even published in the FIDONEWS?  Be reasonable.  The
     books are available for inspection AS THEY ALWAYS HAVE BEEN!

     Now I really love Hawaii, where I've lived and raised a family
     for the last 27 years.  Did you think that I was going to change
     my residence to St. Louis or Tennessee while I was treasurer just
     so someone could stroll over to my office one day to inspect
     those books and papers?  What about the next treasurer.  If he or
     she lives in California, is that going to be any more convenient
     to our members in St. Louis or in Tennessee (or even Holland?)  I
     think not.
     FidoNews 5-17                Page 14                  25 Apr 1988


     TWO REASONABLE SOLUTIONS

     A moment ago I asked you to be reasonable.  This is what I mean
     by "reasonable."  First, be aware that Honolulu is the eleventh
     largest city in the U. S.  We have offices here that house each
     of the "Big Eight" accounting firms.  Additionally, there are
     about 2,200 CPA's actively making a living performing accounting
     services for others.  If you can't, or won't make the trip here
     to inspect IFNA's books, why not ask YOUR ACCOUNTANT to recommend
     one of OUR LOCAL ACCOUNTANTS to inspect the books for you.  Give
     him/her specific instructions how you would like the accounting
     to look like when they are completed as there is NO ONE WAY TO
     ACCOUNT for transactions irrespective of what you may think or
     have been led to believe.

     A second solution would be to ASK to have a copy of ALL THE
     RECORDS in the treasurer's possession sent to you or a nominee of
     your choice.  Be prepared to pay for the reproduction costs of
     these records.  (You really don't expect IFNA to shoulder this
     expense for EVERY MEMBER that does not want or cannot inspect the
     books at the treasure's domicile, do you?)

     In any case, the two solutions offered are a heck of a lot
     cheaper than any court room engagement.  And more substantial
     than the threats, intimidation, harassment, inuendoes, slurs, and
     other slings and arrows our, make that your, directors and
     officers had to endure.  And your directors and officers are all
     UNPAID VOLUNTEERS, to boot!


     THUMPERS' ACCOMPLISHMENTS

     As a matter of fact, in many cases your officers and directors
     weren't ever the THUMPERS' directors.  MANY OF THE LOUDEST
     THUMPERS ARE NOT MEMBERS OF IFNA.  But incredibly they want an
     accounting just the same!  WANNA TALK ABOUT YOUR BASIC CHUTZPAH!

     So what have these THUMPERS accomplished.  Let me begin . . .
     First, they burned out many sysops who tried to put together an
     organization whose sole purpose was to BETTER THE POLITICAL,
     ECONOMIC, TECHNICAL, AND SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT OF SYSOPING!  They
     sapped the vitality out of those sysops. They continue to leech
     this energy of the remaining board and then complain that IFNA
     has no direction, no purpose, no results.  My fellow sysops, HOW
     IN HELL do you expect your board to function when ELECTRONIC
     WOLVES are sniping at your flanks, MERCILESSLY, while at every
     turn our fellow directors are being devoured!

     Is my metaphor to strong?  Too graphic?  I think not!  How else
     to explain the loss of the wonderful guidance and services of
     outstanding human beings and humanitarians like Ben Baker, Thom
     Henderson, and Bob Hartman to name but three.  There are others,
     too many for me to remember at 2:30 in the A.M. as I am writing
     this.  My apologies for not mentioning their names.  In their
     hearts and OUR MINDS we know who they are.

     FidoNews 5-17                Page 15                  25 Apr 1988


     THUMPERS OF THE WORLD -- WHERE ARE YOU?

     Did any of these THUMPERS volunteer to DONATE THEIR SERVICES to
     help IFNA go "in the right direction?"  I can assure you that all
     they had to do was ask and our board would have showered them
     with appreciation . . . and work!  I know, because even from
     someplace AS FAR OFF AS IN HAWAII, I got the thankless job of
     whipping your books into a semblance of order so that you could
     have the ACCOUNTING WE WERE ALL ENTITLED TO!

     No one of us is looking for THANKS.  But for CHRISSAKES, no one
     of us was looking to be dumped upon, either!  Have a little
     humanity in your soul.


     HOORAY FOR FIDOCON88

     By the way, if neither of the solutions I've mentioned earlier
     works for you, here's a third.  YOUR PRECIOUS BOOKS with their
     jots and tittles of IMPORTANT INFORMATION, upon which THE FUTURE
     OF ALL MANKIND DEPENDS will be at the FIDOCON88, if you can wait
     that long.  Would it kill the few BIG THUMPERS among you to wait
     until then?


     COME BACK GUYS!  PLLLEEEASE!
     (we'll all be your best friends for life)

     And while we're waiting, would it be too much for us to ask,
     beseech, and beg Ben, Thom, Bob, and the others to reconsider and
     please COME BACK!  IFNA NEEDS YOU!  So do we all, NEED YOU, NOW!
     Only when we all PULL TOGETHER, will we solve the real problems
     of our BBS community:  Integrated Alternate Nets, Government
     Incursions, Electronic Law and Order, and most important, WHERE
     HAS ALL THE FUN GONE!
