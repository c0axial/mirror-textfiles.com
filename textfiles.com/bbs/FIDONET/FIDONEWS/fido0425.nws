     Glen Jackson
     Fido/SEAdog 100/517

                              Updates and such

     First of all,  It's sure good to be back into the  net.  We  went
     down  around May 10th for our big move,  and with the move came a
     new phone number.  Please,  if you are at all interested  in  the
     Broadcast  Echos,  jot  this  number  down.  100/517  is  now  at
     1-314-928-2501.

     We're slowly growing in our  little  echo.  We  now  carry  three
     seperate message areas dedicated the broadcast industry. They are
     1)Conversations  for  the  public  and broadcasters,  2) Jobs and
     situations in the  broadcast  industry,  and  3)for  Broadcasters
     only.

     To keep you up to date, these nodes carry the echos. If you would
     like to participate,  drop us netmail at 100/517, and we will co-
     ordinate you into the topology.  PLEASE - we would prefer  to  do
     the co-ordinating so we can keep track of this echo.  Here is who
     currently participates:

     113/1            Small_Biz_Net           Honolulu, HI
     501/4697         SVT_Public_TV           Stockholm, Sweden
     135/1            Ram_Soft                Miami, FL
     104/69           Metroplex               Denver, CO
     151/301          BNC_Connector           Boone, NC
     125/406          KLOK_FM                 San Francisco, CA
     151/108          Drums_Opus              Cary, NC
     11/107           Bourbonnis_BBS          Bourbonnis, IL
     19/3             Dark_Cavern             Lawton, OK
     150/614          Charis_TBBS             Philadelphia, PA
     135/11                                   FL
     104/108          Micro_Link              Littleton,CO
     969/500                                  NY
     150/600          Philadelphia_Hub        Pydal, PA

     We  currently  set  aside  the  time  between 1:15 AM and 1:45 AM
     (Central) for polling.  Since we now have SEAdog,  polls  can  be
     accepted at any time.

                               NEXT - MSGDB

     Recently we introduced a new utility, MSGDB. This is for OPUS and
     FIDO  sysops  that  want to do full message bit editing in all of
     their message areas,  or move a message from one area to another.
     It can be file requested from either 100/510 or 100/517. The file
     to ask for is MSGDB.ARC.

                      FINALLY - another BBS interface

     FidoNews 4-25                Page 2                    6 Jul 1987


     We  are  also  working  on  a  full  implementation of a WWIV BBS
     network interface.  If any of you have had experience with  WWIV,
     or  logged  on  to  a  WWIV system,  you know that this is a good
     message base BBS. When we finish, WWIV will be able to handle all
     netmail and echomail capabilities.  If you have any  comments  on
     this, just leave me a note.

                             NOW - the soapbox

     Short, but sweet.  This week I dropped the SYSOP ECHO.  After not
     being on the network for 6 weeks,  I picked up  all  of  my  back
     logged  sysop  echomail.  Nothing  has changed much.  No sense in
     carrying the same old same old and wasting disk space with it.

                               LET'S FINISH

     We have a few TV people on the Broadcast echo that are asking for
     more participation.  It seems like the radio people  do  all  the
     talking.  Is  the  reason  the TV people are so quiet on the echo
     because they want to be seen as well as be heard? Let's hope not.

     I want to thank all of you for the support you've been  over  the
     last few weeks. I certainly enjoy the network!

     Give us a shout with any comments, etc at 100/517!

     This is the FIDONEWS version of the  ECHOLIST.  A  more  detailed
     version  showing  networks  served,  secondary  "contact"  nodes,
     approximate traffic volume,  number of  participating  nodes  and
     more can be File Requested as ECHOLIST.ARC from

                  107/316   Thomas Kenny
                  107/269   Mitch Kessler

     We  hope  that  more  SEAdog  running  BBSs  will  want  to  help
     distribute the ECHOLIST.  Ideally such a board would allow  first
     time callers to File Request or download the list at 2400 Baud.

     There's  been  a  bit  of  a change in the format of the FidoNews
     version of the list this month:  proposed conferences are at  the
     end of the list in their own section,  and ECHOS that do not name
     a moderator or coordinator are not listed.

                 FREEWARE: The End of Amateur Programming?
                 -----------------------------------------

     "Why aren't  there very  many new  programs  being  uploaded  any
     more?", she asked after looking over the file areas on the board.

     "Now that's  a good question.", I replied.  "I really don't know.
     It looks  as if  nobody is  writing any  of  their  own  programs
     anymore.  I wonder why....."

     That is a part of the conversation that prompted this article.  I
     don't know  if the  rest of  you are  noticing a  similar lack of
     original  software  being  uploaded  by  your  users  but  it  is
     certainly very  evident here  at The Power Station.  Now, that is
     not to  say that  there are  no uploads,  just that  there is  no
     uploading of local, original software.

     It doesn't  seem that  long ago (not more than 2 or 3 years) when
     almost EVERYBODY  who owned  a computer  was writing software for
     it.   Most of  the programs were written in BASIC and were kludgy
     and slow  as molasses  in the  spring, but  all that  aside,  the
     programmer was  PROUD to  have contributed something and couldn't
     wait to  share their  offering with others.  All of that seems to
     have changed,  now.   The reason....  FREEWARE / SHAREWARE / User
     Supported Software!

     There is  an abundance  of  good  (in  fact  EXCELLENT)  software
     available to  do almost  anything a  person needs or wants.  This
     software is of sufficient quality to rival a large portion of the
     commercial software  available at  a fraction  of the  cost  (for
     those who  choose to  pay for it - but that's a different story).
     Why would  anybody want to slave away for hours (or days) piecing
     together a  program to  do something  when there  is  a  FREEWARE
     package readily  available that  does the  same thing  faster and
     easier?

     The  tremendous   amount  of   software  available   is   largely
     responsible for more and more computer systems being purchased by
     people with no desire to learn to program.  These people view the
     systems as  tools to  be used to make a job easier or faster just
     like any other tool.

     We are  becoming "users"  as opposed  to the computer "hobbiests"
     and "enthusiasts"  that used  to be  the norm!   This is becoming
     increasingly evident  by the number of program requests and "wish
     lists" being passed around.

     Those of  us who  do still  take the time to "patch together" the
     occasional utility  in BASIC,  are ashamed  to show it to anybody
     else  because   we  cannot  compete  with  the  software  readily
     available and  are afraid  of being  ridiculed for  our "obvious"
     lack of programming skills.

     Don't get  me wrong, I am very pleased with the vast selection of
     quality software  available and  would probably  not be a part of
     FidoNet without  it, but  I can't help feeling a little sorry for
     FidoNews 4-25                Page 15                   6 Jul 1987


     all the  "average" programmers  out there that will never get the
     chance to   experience  the joy  associated  with  sharing  their
     efforts and, in some small way, being recognized for it.

     FREEWARE: The  End of  Amateur Programming?   Think  about it the
     next time somebody uploads something that is less than perfect!

     The location is an unnamed park, in an unnamed Midwestern city,
     sometime in the future.  A young boy approaches an old man
     sitting on a park bench.

     "Mister..."

     The young boy is insistent.

     "MISTER!"

     The old man looks around nervously then puts a finger to his
     lips to silence the child.  He then takes his thermos of coffee
     and pours it over the bracelet on his left wrist.  After a few
     moments of wincing from the pain, he speaks.

     "The only way to knock off the protein bio-chip in these dang
     monitor bracelets is heat, a LOT of heat.  The government still
     hasn't figured how to fix that glitch.  Dang things let them
     know where you are and everything you say.  You'll be required
     to wear one as soon as you turn 13.  NOW, we have only about 15
     minutes to talk before "The Monitors" pull up to find out why
     my bracelet went dead.  I'll just say I spilled the coffee by
     accident.  When you see a strange vehicle or person
     approaching, just stop talking and walk away.  Talking in
     public is not allowed ya know, especially to an old person..."
     he winks, "we remember too much of the past that they want
     forgotten."

     "Mister, why don't they let people say what they think?  Did
     people talk much in the old days?"

     Leaning back on the park bench with his face glowing from
     pleasant memories, the old man answers.

     "Surely they did, child!  Back even before my time, long ago
     when the country was still young, towns used to have meetings
     in the square for folks to talk.  They had debates and
     arguments.  No topic was taboo.  Then telephones came along and
     you could talk to anyone, anywhere in the world that also had a
     phone.  Nowadays, you have to have a license for a phone and
     anything you say is digitally recorded and checked for
     "subversive" talk by those super-smart computers.  Television,
     radio and newspapers were not owned by the government back
     then.  You could read, see and hear many facts that would help
     you make up your own mind as to what was going on.  We also had
     CB and HAM radio, and something we called the BBS..."

     His voice trails off as he again looks around nervously.

     "What was a BBS, Mister?"

     A deep sorrowful sigh comes before his words.

     "Back in the 1980's the BBS was kind of a throw-back to the old
     town meetings.  Literally hundreds of people could call a
     Bulletin Board computer with their personal computer and leave
     messages, tell jokes, chat, argue politics, make friends..."

     Tears fill the old man's eyes.

     "Then the government must have figured that so many people
     talking wasn't healthy, too many diverse opinions and ideas.
     So, they started regulating and licensing all forms of speech,
     all ways of thinking.  Was gradual at first but they finally
     closed them all down.  I was both a D-dialer and a BBSer!  We
     all had real names back then instead of government numbers, but
     we also had handles, kind of like nicknames.  Lord, I remember
     meeting some special, wonderful folks like Lady Galadriel, Lord
     Ming, Bruiser, Zap, Ingvar, Oods, K-9, Badger, Hex40, Hose,
     Hoagy, Mac The Navigator, Lawyer John, Grumpy, Haus Frau, Poet,
     By Tor and Reiny, Opti and Falcon, The Masked Twinkie, Deep
     Thought, Air Wolf, Double M, Boysie Oakes, Rocker, Multi, P.C.
     Kid, Ziggy, Prak and hundreds of others just like 'em! "

     "What ever happened to them all, Mister?"

     "Oh, the government had trouble putting them down, they were
     fighters!  They were finally captured at the battle of
     Staehle's vineyards. Some say MadZax escaped from the
     institution," he smiles slyly, "but no one really knows for
     sure."

     "Who were you, Mister?  What was your handle?"

     The old man makes a slight hand gesture to the child,
     indicating that someone is approaching.  As the child begins to
     walk away the old man whispers a parting thought.

     "Don't matter who I was then, son.  I'm nobody now..."

     Steve Bonine
     Cope BBS, 115/777

                       Proposal for New Echomail Area

     I attended a seminar a few weeks ago which was hosted by  one  of
     the mainframe software vendors.  They [the vendor] have a product
     which is a BBS for mainframe systems programmers.  For only $2600
     a year, you can call it and swap problems and solutions with your
     peers.  The  speaker at the seminar was extolling the wonders and
     advantages of bulletin board systems.  We've been  familiar  with
     those for some time, haven't we?

     I'm not prepared to charge anyone, so I guess that means that any
     service  which we might provide via echomail couldn't possibly be
     as valuable as what this vendor was  offering.  However,  it  did
     point  out  to  me that there exists a potential market for a new
     echomail area.  As far as I know there is  nothing  currently  in
     place  which  addresses  issues important to those of us who earn
     our living ministering to large mainframe-based systems.

     If you are in this category,  please indicate  your  interest  by
     sending  me  a  netmail  message  on 115/777.  If there is enough
     interest,  I'll start something.  This conference might even give
     you  a  legitimate excuse to call your BBS from work,  or even to
     run a BBS sponsored by your company.

     Maybe the subject is too broad.  After all,  I'm  not  even  sure
     what  the  definition should be for "mainframe".  Maybe we'll end
     up with several conferences.  Maybe I only THINK that many of you
     who participate in FidoNet are involved with mainframes.

     I'll handle the initial distribution,  and if we grow then  we'll
     worry  about  how  this  topology  should  be built.  It would be
     helpful in the "I am interested" message if I  knew  whether  you
     can accept crash mail, and what hours might be best.

     Any other comments are more than welcome.  If something like this
     already  exists,   my  project  is  redundant.   If  interest  is
     indicated, I would like to get started around the middle of July.

     The Entertainment Line Fido 104/36, Lakewood (Denver), CO

                   Further Observations About PK vs. ARC

     It seems that the discussion about PKARC/PKXARC versus  ARC  will
     never  cease.  Both  of  these programs make our lives easier and
     save space on our disk drives.

     Much has been said about the incompatibility of PKARC's  archives
     with ARC.  Not often, if ever, is PKARC's "/oct" switch mentioned
     in comparative testing.

     The  "/oct"  switch simply forces PKARC to make archives that use
     file compression and time stamping techniques that ARC and  other
     compatible programs will understand.  When this switch is used in
     making  the  archive,  either  PKXARC or ARC can be used for file
     extraction.

     My underlying question, then,  was whether PKARC still would make
     smaller  files  than  ARC,  despite  the  absence  of  the  newer
     compression method that PKARC  usually  employs.  The  answer  is
     yes.

     In  my  testing,  I used four files with a total of 76,799 bytes,
     with one .DOC file,  one .SYS file,  one .EXE file and  one  .COM
     file.  ARC  made  an  archive  of  46,523  bytes.  PKARC  made an
     archive of 45,930 bytes,  a savings of 593 bytes.  Time was not a
     tested  element  here;  let  it  suffice  to  say  that PKARC was
     substantially quicker.

     The results were not amazing,  but in theory (actual results  may
     and  probably  will  vary) 2 megabytes of ARC's archives,  if re-
     archived with PKARC using the "/oct" switch, would take up around
     25,500 bytes less.  Without the "/oct" switch, I would venture to
     guess that they would take up even less space.

     As a control, I used ARC to de-arc the archive made by PKARC, and
     used PKXARC to de-arc ARC's archive.  Both were successful.

     To summarize,  although PKARC performs better WITHOUT the  "/oct"
     switch, it still appears to out-perform ARC in both speed and and
     archive file size categories.  When PKARC is used with the "/oct"
     switch,   substantial   time  savings  are  realized  during  the
     archiving process, without sacrificing compatibility with ARC.

                                Mail Relays

     In regards to the article on overly large nodelists,  I wonder if
     the following routing scheme might work?

     EXAMPLE:

     Mail  originates  from  my  node  137/71  bound  for  a  node  in
     California.  Instead of direct routing,  this mail would be  sent
     to his Relay Node.


         137/71         160/33        160/20
     (A) Origin ------->Relay ------->Destination


     The thought behind this is that the originating station calls the
     Relay  station,  this  Relay station would be in the same city as
     the destination station,  where  a  long  distance  call  is  not
     required to reach the destination Node.

     If  you  have 30 nodes in one city,  then one of them will be the
     Relay Node for the other 29.  That eliminates 29 Nodes  from  the
     Nodelist  and this is just one city!  It would eliminate a lot of
     Nodes from the Nodelist and get it  back  down  to  a  reasonable
     size, which would be much easier to work with.

     What about Crash Priority Mail, or mail with attached files?

     No  problem,  the  Relay Nodes would have a batch file written to
     immediately forward Crash mail to  destination  upon  receipt  of
     same.  Attached files; same as regular mail.

     How will we know which Node serves which other Nodes?

     Publish  one  Master  Nodelist,  showing  the Relay Nodes and the
     Nodes they serve.  This would be an ascii  text  file  and  could
     then  be  updated  when Relay Nodes add or drop Nodes they serve.
     Only the updates would be published as each Node already has  the
     Master Nodelist.

     Nodes  being  served  might have to help out the Relay station in
     terms of some kind of monetary help,  as he might  need  a  large
     hard disk for temporary message storage if he is handling a large
     volume  of  mail  each  night.  I'm sure this could be worked out
     between the Relay and Destination Nodes without too much problem.
     They would have to have a  volunteer  Relay  station,  but  there
     should be no problem here either,  since some are already serving
     as inbound gates, etc.

     In large metro areas, two or more Relay stations might be needed.
     In small rural areas the Relay station might be  the  destination
     station.

     EXAMPLE: NET 137

     FidoNews 4-25                Page 21                   6 Jul 1987


     137/71  is  the  only node in Naples,  so I would be my own relay
     station.

     (1)  Nodes  other  than  Relay  Nodes  would  have   a   Nodelist
          consisting  of only Relay Nodes for the entire Network.  All
          traffic would be routed to these Relay Nodes for  forwarding
          to destination Nodes.

     (2)  Relay  Nodes  would  have a Nodelist consisting of all Relay
          Nodes in the Network and the Nodes they serve.

     Regional  Coordinator  duties  and  policies  might  have  to  be
     redifined to some extent to include the Relay stations, etc.

     Also,  I wonder if all Regions/Networks/Nodes could switch to GMT
     time?  This would eliminate the problem of different time  zones.
     Sysops could inform their users that they were now using GMT time
     for  mailing  purposes.  I don't know of any user who calls a BBS
     for a time-of-day check,  so this shouldn't be a big problem.  We
     wouldn't have to worry about daylight savings time, EST, CST, MST
     or  any  of  the time zones,  as all would be indicating the same
     time, year round.

     You asked for input, so here is mine.  Keep up the good work.

     Sincerely,

          After  using  Microsoft  C  (4.00)  for  only  the period of
          December - May 1987,  and only having that  much  experience
          with C itself,  I can't say I'm very qualified to speak of a
          C compiler.  Currently,  however,  I (we) have switched over
          to  Turbo  C  from  MSC  because  of  the  advantages of the
          Integrated Package.

          The 2 books that come with Turbo C (A "User's Guide",  and a
          "Reference Guide" -- In Softbound book form), are easier for
          a novice to digest than the MSC.  The User's Guide devotes a
          full  chapter  to  the Turbo Pascal User who is just getting
          into C (a nice chapter to include!) with  examples  side  by
          side of Turbo Pascal,  and Turbo C.  The Reference book goes
          through the Libraries, and the ANSI language extentions that
          Turbo  C  provides,   complete  with  examples  on  selected
          material.

          I  found  the  libraries to have more useable functions than
          the MSC.  Such as:

              BIOSCOM    (comm ports),
              BIOSEQUIP  (equipment),
              BIOSDISK   (Disk I/O),
              BIOSMEMORY (Memory Size),
              FILELENGTH (filesize in bytes),
              FINDFIRST  (First filename in dir),
              FINDNEXT   (next in dir)
                    [both return a structure of the DIR
                     information, EG: Attrib, time, date,
                     size, name],
              FNMERGE    (Filename Merge --  name with path),
              FNSPLIT    (Filename split -- name and path),
              POKE       (send value to mem),
              LOCALTIME  (converts date/time to struct),
              and others.....

     Needed
     Improvements:  A  CodeView  type  Debugger,   or  make  the  code
                    CodeView compatible.  Help screens could be better
                    written/designed, and be referenced more (EG:  See
                    xxx for more details).  There are others, but lets
                    not detract  on  a  good  review  for  some  minor
                    adjustments.


       Overall:  A worthy opponent to MSC 4.00.  Should be interesting
                 to   see  how  well  the  "establishment"  views  it.
                 Excellent purchase for the "novice" C programmer, and
                 for the experienced C programmer.

            PS:  Some of those who might have assumed  that  this  was
                 vaporware,  were  wrong.  There's  no  way  that they
                 could have put this product out that quickly, because
                 of it's quality.

     CCITT V21,V23,V22,V22bis

                    Does IFNA Matter Outside The USA ?

     One  of the interesting observations made about the USA from this
     side  of  the  Atlantic  is your use of  grand  titles.  I  refer
     particularly   to  things  like  'The  First  National  Bank   of
     Smallville'.  In  the online world 'The Source' sounds like  some
     great  prophet from the Ten Commandments rather than  a  computer
     information bank.

     Equally we English can also get confused with the 'World  Series'
     and   in   FidoNet  'The  International   FidoNet   Association',
     incorporated in Missouri !!??

     In  fact,  after last years' conference at Colerado Springs  IFNA
     looked  a lot like the World Series. (A strange game with a grand
     title that only Americans played.)

     People  began  writing  in FidoNews that WE  had  created  a  new
     international organisation.  Others talked of a kind of new Mafia
     wanting  to  'control' the net.  The surprising thing was in  the
     echomail  conferences that got to this side of the Atlantic  this
     bitching  was  even  worse because it was seen  out  of  context,
     without any common reference points.

     Then  the by-laws arrived.  Well,  my users thought it was a good
     laugh. I took a copy of the by-laws and put them up on my system,
     that  provoked some interest.  As a foreign language exercise  it
     was  quite  interesting to try to discover what the by-laws  were
     actual saying about an INTERNATIONAL association.

     That hurdle was followed by further waves of apathy,  if you  can
     have  apathic enthusiasm,  for the interim elections to the board
     of directors.

     Of course the major problems faced by British sysops were; how do
     I  get reliable communications with the USA,  what  happens  when
     Fido  cannot  handle  the nodelist,  how can  we  participate  in
     helping  to develop Fido Compatible software,  what is the Usenet
     gateway and are there other gateways?

     Then  later on we wanted to know:  what is Opus,  how can we  get
     news about it,  participate and help those in the USA working  on
     software  for it,  what do Help nodes actually do(!),  how can  I
     join IFNA as a foreign sysop ?

     I could add a further 1001 pratical questions that we, as Net 510
     Hosts,   have  dealt  with  over  the  year  since  the  Colorado
     Conference including the almost daily use of Norton Utilities  to
     get  Fido  to PULSE DIAL instead of TONE when a new sysop gets  a
     distribution  copy  of  Fido,  (which of course  he  has  wrongly
     guessed does not work!).

     Yet, we have grown. One year ago only one Net (503) in the UK now
     there  are four nets,  new sysops,  new ideas.  Some of  the  old
     favourites  like  Frank  Thornley of Compulink have  gone  on  to
     very different things far outside FidoNet.

     At  present IFNA matters little to the UK sysop.  The day to  day
     struggle of getting batch files to terminate for odd combinations
     of mailer programs is the main pre-occupation. If we want to just
     be  in the nodelist ,  then "prune" and "nodesiev" are the weekly
     routine  of running a Email-ing BBS so that it can  indeed  Email
     someone!

     My  most  common  requests as Host are for  cut  down  customised
     nodelists,  ie a nodelist that includes Europe and Australia (its
     a shame that Texas won't fit on, with the 1200 limit!).

     However there is hope.  The new sysops in the UK, like ourselves,
     joined FidoNet in order to talk to the world.  Little things like
     an   incomprehensible   constitution,   poor   communication   of
     International  aims in IFNA,  illegal non-standard modems  (sorry
     Ma-Bell),  and  the  whole  of the world  outside  North  America
     dropping off the nodelist won't stop us.

     IFNA does stand a chance.  If you have a good conference,  report
     accurately what you discuss,  explain your decisions and argue in
     'friendly' way we may even take what you do seriously.

     There  is a massive expansion of FidoNet in Europe and most of it
     is  new  blood.

     If  you  involve us,  however remotely,  in the  decisions  which
     affect  the  software  we  have on our systems  you  may  get  an
     international association.

     To  those of you,  both for and against the IFNA,  the  case  for
     membership,  even  for existance at all has not yet even been put
     to  Europeans  in a way we can respond to.  A  lively  conference
     where you concentrate on all Fido's, not just North America, will
     help people over here see relevance in what you do.

     I personally think IFNA could be a big worldwide organisation  of
     amateur   computer  communications  enthusiasts  associated   via
     FidoNet.  I  want  to join.  By running a  successful  conference
     please encourage us to want to get others over here to join too.

     I was thinking of fun things to do and decided to officially
     create an un official organization for the elimination of UN_FUN.

     Now this isn't an easy task, first I had to define what the major
     objectives would be.

     First to mind was just eliminate all those  things in our lives
     and hobbies that aren't fun.  After giving that some thought I
     realized that most of us don't know how to have fun so if we
     eliminated the UN_FUN aspects we would have nothing left.

     So the next idea (and the one I like the most (I don't work too
     hard on any problem)) was to replace the doldrums with something
     fun to do.  What that means is if your getting tired of doing
     something, don't just stop doing it but find some way to improve
     it.

     The second major objective would be to eliminate the UN_FUN being
     forced upon us by UN_FUN people,  when someone gets on our case
     just tell them they are vying for the UN_FUN person of the week
     award.  We will have a vote, not tally the results and tell
     everyone nominated that they won.  Hopefully they can be brought
     into the societies fold.

     Maybe we will have contests and guest speakers on how to have fun
     once again and award the winners and speakers with a resounding
     round of laughter.

     Now I know many of you are going to want to join this elite
     organization so I will tell you what you need to do to become a
     FUN person.

     First of all have a good laugh, second take the sacred OATH.
     Repeat after me "I am a FUN person and I vow to eliminate UN_FUN
     where ever I may encounter it." There, now you are a member.

     Lastly comes the matter of money, we all know how important this
     organization is, so what I think would be fair is that you
     allocate $25.00 and take someone out for a FUN time, maybe the
     kids to a miniature golf course, or the wife out to dinner.
     Remember though that you have to have FUN or it doesn't count.

     Lastly (this time for real), you can tell people that you belong
     to a non secret organization dedicated to the overthrow of UN_FUN
     in your signature.


     Bill

     President and Chairman of the Board of FUN, an elite organization
     for the elimination of UN_FUN.

                  US Naval Observatory Time Now Available

     UPDATE.EXE is a utility to load the exact time generated  by  the
     U.S  Naval  Observatory  time  clock  directly into your PC's DOS
     CLOCK.  The program accesses your  modem  and  calls  Washington,
     D.C.  When  the  USNO  answers it spits out repetitively the date
     and time.  This version does  not  extract  the  date.  A  future
     version will.

     If  you  really  want  time accuracy then this is the program for
     you.  It has been designed to work as an eXternal event from both
     opus and seadog systems.

     I heard about this service USNO had,  so I thought I would try to
     use it to my advantage and this program is the result.

     NOTE: If you have a clock calendar card,  that will  have  to  be
           reset by whatever software came with it. Only the DOS clock
           gets updated.

     Credit  has  to  be  given  to  Bill Boyer for steering me in the
     proper direction.

     This and many other  fine  utilties  are  available  on  107/201.
     Request UPDATE.ARC from 107/201 for this program.

                  NEW FIDO(tm) OPUS(tm) SEADOG(tm) UTILITY


     COMPLETE Message Editor  for  FIDO(TM)  OPUS(tm)  and  SEADOG(tm)
     systems...released by the S1S Partnership Project:

         Rits Board         (314)-426-7144  OPUS/SEAdog 100/510
         Broadcast Software (314)-427-4064  Fido        100/517

     Complete  pre-registration release of MSGDB will be available for
     downloading from these two boards on May 25th, 1987.

     What IS MSGDB ???

     MSGDB allows you to change the attributes on each message in each
     area you have set up. The following can be changed with MSGDB:

         private/public
         crash
         recv'd
         sent
         file attached
         forward
         orphan
         kill/sent
         local
         hold
         res/sent
         file request
         recpt request
         return recpt
         request audit

     You can also change FROM, TO, SUBJECT, COST, and # READ.

     PLUS (there's more!)...  how many times have you wanted to easily
     move a message from one area to another without complicated batch
     procedures, renaming and/or renumbering? MSGDB allows you to move
     a message to another area,  and gives you the option to leave the
     original message in the original area,  or delete it and keep  it
     only in the new area.

     How are we distributing it?  Well,  for those of you that keep up
     with the Sysop echo,  we kind  of  like  Bob  Hartmans'  idea  of
     FLIRTWARE.  We'll  have  a working copy available on May 25th for
     downloading on both of the boards listed.  The  Rits  Board  also
     uses SEAdog, so you can file request it from area 8. The copy you
     will  get  will do most of the basic editing functions,  and will
     come with some limited docs.

     We're going to ask for a registration of $20.00,  and this is  to
     cover  cost  of  updates  and  new releases,  plus the time we're
     taking to offer such a FANTASTIC Utility. (you know how it goes).
     Registered owners will be sent a FULL  BLOWN  working  copy  that
     will   do  everything  but  blow  your  nose,   along  with  FULL
     documentation.
     FidoNews 4-25                Page 30                   6 Jul 1987


     There are more utilities in the works,  and registered users will
     be  automatically  sent  out copies of new Utilities from the S1S
     Partnership Project.

     By the way,  if you haven't yet sent Bob Hartman $35.00  for  the
     full set of the FASTSCAN series,  it's well worth it.  Saves MUCH
     time on scanning and tossing.

     One more thing.  MSGDB obviously is  a  SysOp  only  utility.  We
     thought long and hard on whether or not to include the ability to
     change  a  private  message  to  a  public  message.  It  is  our
     conclusion that it should be there,  for  one  important  reason.
     Many   times   newer  users  will  ask  technical/help  questions
     privately to another user or to the SysOp.  These questions,  and
     later answers, would in most cases be beneficial to ALL users. If
     you  have  any  thoughts  on this,  communicate to us through the
     SysOp echo.

     Eric Ewanco, private SEAdog 130/3

                             Borland's Turbo C:
                               Review, part 1

         For a long, long, time, Borland has promised us Turbo C. Ever
     since I contracted a passion for learning C, I have been dying to
     get it.  I have finally realized that dream.  And I must say,  in
     all truthfulness, Turbo C is *THE* compiler of the century. Turbo
     C is what we've all been waiting for.

         Many people, include myself to some extent, were disappointed
     with  Turbo BASIC.  Somewhat bug-ridden,  non-standard,  and to a
     degree weak (keep in mind I'm  speaking  from  a  "C  and  Pascal
     snob"'s  point of view),  it reflected the usual disadvantages of
     all BASICs.  Don't let Turbo BASIC give you a bad  impression  of
     Turbo  C.  Turbo  C  is  all  that  you  would expect in a good C
     compiler.

         Borland has long been known for fast compiling and executing,
     inexpensive compilers, packed features,  good documentation,  and
     excellent customer acknowledgement.  However, they are also known
     for non-linking, non-libraries, non-standards, and compilers that
     just don't fit in well. Turbo C ends all that. Before I got Turbo
     C,  I feared that it would be packed with  annoying  "extensions"
     and be essentially another language only similar to C, like Turbo
     Pascal.  Do  that  was  fine  for Pascal,  but C is different;  I
     thought if Philippe tried to make a splash with a new twist to C,
     he'd drown.  But all my fears have been laid to rest.  Turbo C is
     ENTIRELY  K&R  C,  with  almost all UNIX functions implemented by
     MicroSoft C (what I considered the very best compiler and closest
     to UNIX,  a consideration I may  have  to  rethink)  and  a  full
     implementation of ANSI draft C. (ANSI C has not been approved; it
     is  only a draft,  so a conformity to "ANSI C" cannot be claimed,
     only to "ANSI C draft.") Turbo C also offers many more functions,
     surprisingly, they are along the lines of the UNIX functions that
     MS C missed and some nice hardware dependent stuff.  Borland  did
     not  forget  that  C  is a low level language and was meant to be
     hardware oriented, a concept that if neglected could be fatal for
     marketing.  Philippe in his infinite insight did not neglect that
     concept.

         I have found no glaring bugs in Turbo C that I didn't already
     know about;  and in fact,  one bug that was listed on the Borland
     forum I tried to correct and it was already corrected.  Another I
     saw  in  Echomail  had to do with some obscure convolution of the
     environment, but not something you'd run into every day,  or even
     in a year, probably. I have complete faith that any bugs that ARE
     in  there  will  be  corrected  in the usual Borland style,  with
     upgrades sent free to users with bugged versions.

     RUN TIME LIBRARY
     FidoNews 4-25                Page 32                   6 Jul 1987


         The run time library is the most  complete  I've  seen,  with
     over 300 functions.  Strangely missing,  but not very missed, are
     the Borland screen I/O,  graphics,  sound,  and other  extensions
     found in Turbo Pascal, Turbo BASIC, and Turbo Prolog.  Since C is
     a language not meant for such applications,  I will not miss  it.
     Turbo  Pascal  4.0  will  surely  have  them,  and have them in a
     library we can steal from.

         Borland does offer some striking functions. For instance, the
     much-needed findfirst() and findnext()  functions  are  included,
     used for processing wildcard specs.  searchpath() will search the
     current directory then the PATH spec for a specified file. keep()
     will terminate and stay resident  and  take  care  of  the  nasty
     memory  cleanup.   hardxxxx()  routines  are  used  for  handling
     annoying "Abort, Retry, Ignore?" errors.  fnmerge() and fnsplit()
     process a file spec and its individual components;  drive,  path,
     filename,  and extension.  getpass() is  a  conio  function  that
     prints a prompt,  disables echo, reads in up to 8 characters, and
     returns them in a string. Absolute disk i/o is supported. You can
     get and set a file's time or date. Set the DOS time or date.  Get
     country  dependent information.  Binary search,  quick sort,  and
     linear searches. Signals. printf with pointer value display. Math
     error trapping.  Sharing and locking.  Get FAT information.  Many
     time  functions.  Get  disk free space.  Full and complete string
     functions. Sleep so many seconds. Set interrupt vector. And every
     function in MS C except 4 functions (mentioned below).  Every one
     is labelled with portability considerations and cross references.
     It also supports predefined macros that expand to  compile  time,
     compile date,  Turbo C version number,  line number,  source file
     name, memory model, ANSI C compatibility, and much more.

     COMPATIBILITY

         As far as I can see,  Turbo C is virtually identical to MS  C
     with  the exception of a few functions.  Some functions are named
     differently in Turbo  C  and  Borland  was  very  thoughtful  and
     included  #defines in the header files to take care of this.  The
     only  glaring  exception  is  that  signal()  is  implemented  as
     ssignal(),  but  as  far as I can see that's the only difference.
     Turbo C has an explicit method for handling  control  break,  but
     I'm not sure if it can be done via ssignal() like it can in MS C.

         The  functions  I  found  not supported explicitly in Turbo C
     that are found in MS C are the following:

       tempname(), tmpfile(), tmpname() (mktemp and creattemp exist)
       rmtemp() onexit (implemented as atexit())

     and that's about all.  Turbo C is not wimpy;  it  implements  all
     global  variables  MS  C  does  (error  strings,  error  numbers,
     _osmajor, _osminor, __LINE__, __FILE__, sys_errno, etc.).

         In porting MS C programs to Turbo C  I  had  little  problem,
     even  programs  from a book published by MicroSoft Press for MS C
     (as soon as I changed the signal() to ssignal()).  Turbo C offers
     ANSI  only  code  generation  (disable extensions),  optimization
     FidoNews 4-25                Page 33                   6 Jul 1987


     speed/space,  optimization of redundant jumps and  reorganization
     of  loops  and  switch  statements  (don't  ask),  turn off stack
     checking,  string merging (ever wonder why two  string  constants
     with  the  exact same value take up separate places in the object
     file?  Turbo C resolves that),  suppression  of  "redundant  load
     operations  by  remembering the contents of registers and reusing
     them as often as  possible,"  nesting  of  comments,  nesting  of
     #includes,  selectable  1-32  significant  character identifiers,
     80186 instructions,  enabling/disabling of 27 different  warnings
     (including unreachable code,  code has no effect, 'x' is assigned
     a value that is never  used,  function  should  return  a  value,
     possibly incorrect assignment (like "if (a=b)", usually an error)
     and  various  portability  warnings),  assembly code output,  and
     enable/disable register variables. Clearly Turbo C is no wimp.

         Turbo C also includes startup source,  a main() that does not
     access  the  library,  and  a  statement  saying  you can get the
     complete library source licensed for  $295.  I  get  the  sincere
     impression that Turbo C will be well supported. Do I see a source
     code debugger in the works?

         Next week I'll discuss the environment, benchmarks, codesize,
     and hardware interfacing (writing interrupts,  TSRing, converting
     to .COM files, inline assembler, etc.)

                                  157/504

          This has not been a good week. I'm beginning to believe that
     I'm cursed. It started out well enough, but  come the  weekend it
     became a  disaster. As  a result,  I didn't have a chance to look
     over too many of the new products that  have arrived  here. Maybe
     by next  week I'll  have looked over some of it. In the meantime,
     I've learned a lot over the  past week  and taken  a look  at one
     very interesting program.

     -- The Curse --

          It started  off innocently  enough, with a visit to my local
     dealer Friday night. While I was  there he  showed me  one of the
     new  AT  clones  he's  just  starting  to carry in quantity. He's
     usually had two or three AT  clones in  at any  one point  in the
     past,  but  since  the  prices  started  dropping he's decided to
     change over. Instead of  stocking  XT  clones  in  quantity, he's
     going to  start stocking  a variety  of AT  clones. This wasn't a
     major revelation to me. In  the  past  year  prices  have dropped
     dramatically.  A  year  and  a  half  ago  I  bought my first IBM
     compatible system from him, and have  been very  pleased with it.
     It has  never given  me any trouble, and he's always been able to
     help me when it came time  to expand  (hard drive,  modem, etc.).
     The problem is that I can now get an AT for what I paid for my XT
     a year ago. Since he was  finally  buying  ATs  in  quantity, his
     priced had  dropped to something I could afford. I'd been able to
     afford an AT for some time but didn't  want to  go the mail-order
     route. My  dealer has  always been able to help me out when I had
     any questions, and usually lets me look over any software package
     I'm interested in buying (in the store).

          Well,  I  decided  to  take  one  home  that night. He tried
     talking me out of it because the first  shipment of  ATs had just
     come in, and none of the machines had been tested yet. My problem
     is that I'm impatient. We opened up one of them (a 10 mhz machine
     none the  less) and  hooked everything  up and tested it. Fifteen
     minutes later I was satisfied  that  everything  was  working and
     talked him  into letting me take it home that night. Saturday was
     spent transferring boards and the data on the  hard drive between
     my old  XT and the AT. This took a while as I wanted to make sure
     everything came through this  minor surgery  in one  piece. After
     everything  was  transferred  I  called  up a friend who had been
     drooling over the XT and proceeded  to sell  him my  old machine.
     MAJOR MISTAKE!!!  Later that night the keyboard on the new system
     died (or close to it). I had a meeting after work on Monday night
     and it  wasn't until  Tuesday that  I was able to get back to the
     store and swap keyboards.  In the  meantime the  system stayed up
     (for my night calls) and polled my host for mail. I was even able
     to get  the AUTOEXEC.BAT  file set  up to  automatically bring up
     SEAdog in  case of a power failure. The problem was I wasn't able
     to get any work done on  this column  until Wednesday  (the day I
     usually send  'em off  to Thom).  There are two lessons I learned
     from this experience.  1)  Never  rush  your  local  dealer, they
     FidoNews 4-25                Page 35                   6 Jul 1987


     usually  know  what's  best  and  2)  Never  get  rid of your old
     equipment until you've been using  your  new  equipment  for some
     time. Please  don't make the same mistake that I made. My dealer,
     and hopefully yours, was very understanding  when I  got back and
     promptly gave  me a  new keyboard.  I am  very glad that I didn't
     pick up the system from a mail-order company. It could have taken
     over a week with everything being sent through UPS.

     -- QubeCalc (FormalWare Co. $49.95 Registration) --

          Ever since  Visicalc was  introduced, everyone  has tried to
     improve  on  the  basic  idea.  Multiplan  added  sorting  to the
     spreadsheet, and  Lotus added  graphing capabilities. That pretty
     much sums up all the improvements made to spreadsheets in  over 5
     years. I was pretty much convinced that the area had been "panned
     out" until I came across QubeCalc. While QubeCalc  can't cover as
     much 2  dimensional space  as something like Lotus 1-2-3, it does
     do some things that Lotus (and  many other  expensive, commercial
     spreadsheets) can't  do. Since  the product is marketed under the
     shareware/user supported software/etc. plan,  you should  be able
     to download  from a  local board  and decide  if it will work for
     you. If it does,  send in  $49.95 and  you'll receive  the latest
     version, the full typeset manual (a partial manual is included in
     the publicly distributed program) and they'll make sure  you know
     about any updates or new versions as they come out.

          The basic difference in QubeCalc is that it isn't limited to
     the two  dimensions of  most commercial  spreadsheets. Instead of
     representing one  page, QubeCalc represents several pages stacked
     on top of each other. This  means you  no longer  have to arrange
     your spreadsheet with every month's data being in another section
     of the page. Instead you can have a different page for each month
     with the  sums of  a section  going "down"  instead of scattering
     them over a spreadsheet.  You  don't  have  to  remember  how you
     organized  the  years  statements,  instead  each  month or weeks
     statement is on its own "page" with one page being  a grand total
     of all  the pages.  QubeCalc also lets you rotate the data so you
     could turn  the  "pages"  into  a  column  with  the  old columns
     becoming the  pages. I've never seen a program that allows you to
     rotate and analyze data before, so I'm pretty  impressed! Some of
     the  other  features  that  I've  been impressed with include the
     capability to recalc a specific  block  of  the  "spreadcube" (my
     term, not  theirs), and  a DataFill command that can generate all
     types of curves (versus a constant step rate).

          I've been using the product for  several days  and have been
     wishing I had acquired it a year earlier. I had been working as a
     night auditor for a  hotel and  ended up  spending most  of a day
     working on a spreadsheet to generate my daily report. My problems
     all came about because  of  the  three  dimensions  of  my report
     (month-to-date totals,  daily totals,  and column of figures). It
     would have greatly simplified my life  if I  could have  gone in,
     instead I  had to go sideways like crazy. This program could have
     saved me several hours of work. This brings up the major strength
     of QubeCalc.  Since it  has several pages of data, you can EASILY
     have it generate regular  reports without  having to  worry about
     FidoNews 4-25                Page 36                   6 Jul 1987


     going sideways  or down  and possibly  running out of room before
     the end  of  the  week/month/year.  The  only  limitation  is the
     version  I  was  given  (version  1.01)  only  handles  a cube of
     64x64x64. This means you  can go  to 64  columns, 64  rows and 64
     pages. This limits you to 262,144 cells. While this may not sound
     like much, think about how many reports you do that  would exceed
     this limit.  I don't think it would be very many (if any at all).
     While I don't think it's a serious limitation, I do  hope that it
     has or will be increased in the near future.

          I had  no problem becoming used to QubeCalc's commands. Just
     about anyone who is familiar with Lotus 1-2-3  should be  able to
     use  it  without  any  problem.  My  only difficulty was that all
     formulas start out with the equals sign ("="),  and I'm  too used
     to starting  my equations with either an "@" sign or a plus sign.
     Many of the menus look similar to Lotus, and as long as  you read
     the  menus  instead  of  trying  to  operate  on  "full  auto" it
     shouldn't be that difficult  to use.  The setup  program included
     allows  you  to  set  it  up  to  run  from any directory (it has
     overlays and needs to  know where  they are)  and set  the screen
     colors  to  your  personal  preferences. The installation program
     does a nice job  of letting  you "personalize"  the program. I've
     seen quite  a few  commercial programs  that were nowhere near as
     friendly as QubeCalc. Overall  it is  a very  impressive program.
     Anyone  who  is  dealing  with a regularly prepared report should
     look into QubeCalc as  it can  often handle  these reports easier
     than many commercial spreadsheets. Consider the $49.95 price, and
     you come out far ahead on my spreadcube!

     -- Winding down --

          Unfortunately, I spent the most  of  the  weekend  without a
     machine, so  I didn't  have a  chance to look over any games this
     week. I  did have  a chance  to go  over several  books and found
     several I  enjoyed. One  of those  was "Programmer's at Work, 1st
     Series" with interviews by  Susan Lammers  (Microsoft Press, list
     price $14.95).  This is  another of  the books  like "Hackers" or
     "The Soul of  a  New  Machine."  Instead  of  concentrating  on a
     particular  program,  language,  or  technique;  it  looks at the
     people who are  actually  creating  these  strange  machines (and
     programs). Some  of the  more well known names include Bill Gates
     (one of the founders of Microsoft) and Dan Bricklin (VisiCalc and
     Dan Bricklin's Demo Program). Each "chapter" is an interview with
     a  programmer  and  starts  off  with  some  background   on  the
     individual. Each programmer was asked to donate some actual piece
     of work. While most of the code pieces are incomplete,  there are
     a few  "complete" pieces  of work that can be keyed in and run. I
     found the book fascinating,  as  I  learned  the  design concepts
     behind several of today's most popular programs or the beginnings
     of some major advances in personal computing. If  you enjoyed the
     other people  computer books I've looked at, here is one more you
     should consider adding to your library.

          That ties it up for this  week. I'd  enjoy hearing  what you
     think on  anything I've  written about (or missed writing about).
     Many thanks go out to the many of  you who  have been  reading my

      If it wasn't the middle of the summer, I would have sworn
     that issue 4-24 of Fidnews was an April fools issue. The
     editorial was a bit of a downer but the rest of the issue
     was uniformly light harted. Could it be that our editor
     actually edited that issue instead of the old FIFO system?
     Could it be that our editor just was fed up with trojan
     hackers and disk crashes and decided to celebrate April 1
     on June 29? Will we ever know? Do we want to know? Why
     am I asking all the questions? Why don't I find something
     usefull to do?
