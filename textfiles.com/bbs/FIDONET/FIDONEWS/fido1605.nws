     Greetings,

     It's nice to see, FidoNews is read and appriciated by those in far
     away places such as Northern Russia. ;-)

     Still extremely hot here in Africa with unbelievable temperatures,
     the worst or is it highest, for many a decade and not pleasant at all.

     Preparing for another business trip and will be back in time for the
     next issue.

     Enjoy.

     Free Elections - getting your money's worth in Romania.

                                Free Elections
                    Getting Your Money's Worth in Romania
                  Douglas Myers, 1:270/720, doug@mtdnbbs.com

     I've got to confess to some feeling of inadequecy in reporting
     events in Romania.  I'm not there, I don't really know the people
     involved, and my contact started out simply as part of a mass
     mailing.  Nonetheless, a lot of information has come through here,
     and it's too disturbing to simply ignore.

     Region 53 has recently undergone elections to determine a new
     Regional Coordinator to replace the fired Catalin Bradu.  Catalin
     was fired by Ward Dossche, Z2C, for refusing to implement Ward's
     order to reinstate the excommunicated Gabi Andrei.  Ward named
     Costin Manda as temporary R53C, charged with conducting an election
     for a permanent RC.

     Candidates in the recently concluded election were Mihai Banciu and,
     ironically, Catalin Bradu.  Catalin claimed victory with a final
     vote of 11-7, however Ward Dossche awarded the victory to Mihai
     Banciu based on a 25-13 return which included point nodes.

     Catalin is currently petitioning Bob Satti for a "zone independant"
     regional assignment, to operate his region outside the influence of
     Ward Dossche.  He has announced that the region will leave Fido and
     function as a network independant of Fido if all else fails.

     Those are the facts, as nearly as I can determine them, primarily
     derived from email and netmail from Catalin Bradu, Ward Dossche, and
     Codrut Popescu (R53C prior to Catalin).  There are many unanswered
     questions concerning appropriatness, however.

     The first concern is the appropriateness of excommunicating Gabi
     Andrei.  While it seems that he was sufficiently annoying to warrant
     complaints based on "Excessively Annoying Behavior," his own NC
     would not file such a complaint and even supported Gabri.  Is it
     appropriate that an RC will then implement excommunication?
     Granted, it was a popular move - but it was done without the consent
     of the Z2C.  Bob Satti informs me via echomail that a node is not
     normally removed from the nodelist until arguements have been heard
     at the zone level, so the excommunication appears to be procedurally
     incorrect.  However, there is a concern that nodes should not be
     forced to connect to those they find offensive.

     A second concern is the appropriateness of a ZC firing a
     popularly-elected RC.  Policy gives the ZC this power, but practice
     has been to honor elections.  Further, the Z2C has a policy of
     allowing elections... does this imply an obligation to back the
     results of such?  Ward Dossche, in email to Bob Satti with a copy to
     FIDONEWS 16-05               Page 3                    8 Feb 1999


     me, claims that Catalin was never popularly elected as RC, only as
     NC.  Codrut Popescu, who conducted the elections in question,
     explains the actual events in email to me:

     ----------------- extracted from email --------------------

         Almost a year ago I was the elected RC53 in Romania. The Network
     Coordinator position in 530 was open, so I organised elections. You
     have to know that in R53 there are two networks, 530 and 531. 530 for
     Bucharest and 531 for the rest of the country. If you still have the
     nodelists for that period you'll see that 530 was 80% of the total
     nodes number in R53. Now is over 95%.

         The candidates were Alex Sovu, Catalin Bradu and Gabi Andrei. They
     gained 8, 11 and 3 votes, respectively. It is to be mentioned that
     from these 22 votes, 2 were from 531. The NC position in 530 was so
     very important for 531 so I allowed the nodes (very few) from 531 to
     express their votes in these elections.

         So Catalin Bradu gained most of the votes. There was a big rivalry
     between Catalin and Alex, the last one was about to leave the network
     because of his failure in the elections. At the same time I was
     involved in a new position in a bank and when you're 27 years old
     there are some priorities in life. So I appointed Catalin as RC and
     Alex as NC after both of them agreed to stick together for the good of
     the network. Mr. Ward Dossche was informed about this elections at the
     end, and he agreed with the replacement. Though, he was not announced
     about this shifting in the *C hierarchy due to my retirement.

     ----------------- end extract -----------------------------

     It would appear that Ward Dossche is technically correct that
     Catalin was not specifically elected as RC, but, from Codrut's
     description of events, it seems to me that his appointment was in
     order and reflected the will of the voters.

     A third concern is the appearance that the outcome of the recent
     election was predetermined.  This appearance comes from two sources:

     1.  A netmail message from Ward Dossche to Costin Manda instructing
     him that Mihai Banciu was the winner of the election despite an
     early return which favored Catalin by about 2-1.

     2.  The inclusion of point nodes in the final vote count, despite
     the assertion that points were only permitted advisory input
     throughout the election.  Since the points essentially determined
     the election, this is a vital issue.  Ward Dossche claims in email
     that points were traditionally allowed to vote in R53 elections, but
     both Catalin Bradu and Codrut Popescu inform me that point nodes
     have never had a vote in any election until Ward included their
     totals in this most recent vote count.

     A fourth concern is the appropriateness of resolving political
     incompatibilities by entire regions leaving Fido.  Though this may
     be a mere threat, it's hardly conducive to the concerns of many that
     nodelist shrinkage must be halted somehow.  Of course, it may be the
     FIDONEWS 16-05               Page 4                    8 Feb 1999


     only way which Catalin Bradu can get the "zone independant number"
     he's asking for... by forming a new zone.  I'm not sure how Bob
     Satti can issue a "zone independant number."

     New FTSC website

     Hi Folks,

     The FTSC website and anonymous FTP site have new names.

     The new URL for the website is

         http://www.ftsc.org

     The anonymous FTP server is now to be found at ftp.ftsc.org

     -=-

     If you have links to the website I'd be grateful if you could update
     them.
     http://www.piglets.com/ftsc (the old URL) and http://www.ftsc.org are
     exactly the same place but the latter is clearly easier to remember.

     -=-

     More importantly....

     If you are mirroring the FTP site on ftp.piglets.com then you should
     now mirror ftp.ftsc.org.

     I will maintain the old archive for a brief time, but it's location
     (pub/FTSC) is /not/ the same as the new location which is actually in
     ftp.piglets.com/ftp.ftsc.org.

     So if you don't change over before I remove the old archive you could
     have a problem ;-).

     The CGI script on the webpages is already accessing the new document
     repositry.

     CT.

     (...)

     I post some fairly lengthy messages in that echo fairly often,  and
     have never *heard* of any 31,000 byte length limitation.  About that
     "to protect the rest of the echo mail distribution system" part,  are
     there people out there who carry that echo who are running software
     that can't handle a message of that size?  I've certainly never
     received any complaints,  excepting those who are running some really
     old offline readers that truncate stuff at 150 lines or whatever.

     As far as "currently accepted specifications" for echo mail,  where
     are these specifications noted?  It certainly doesn't appear in the
     current copy of BOFAQ901.TXT that's on my system here.  The closest
     seems to be this part here:

         5)  Due to the limitations of some current software, the Backbone
             can not guarantee delivery of messages in excess of 13,000
             bytes.
             Backbone Hubs are encouraged to use message processing
             software which allows larger messages, preferably up to 64K
             bytes, to be handled.

     There's a *BIG* difference between "cannot guarantee delivery" and
     "your message has been deleted because..."

     As far as I'm concerned,  this amounts to nothing more than simple
     censorship based on unpublished criteria.  My position as moderator of
     10TH_AMD is that you either carry the whole echo or don't carry it at
     all.
