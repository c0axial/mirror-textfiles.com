                           THINK BEFORE YOU LEAP
                                About IFNA


               There is a file being sent around attacking the
       proposed IFNA, or International Fido Net Association.  If
       you haven't seen it yet, you probably will.  Please read
       this in it's entirety.  If you don't, then don't even bother
       to talk to me about it.

               Even though parties involved have since apologized,
       serious damage has been done.  The authors did not contact
       any of the people mentioned in the IFNA proposal to ask what
       was going on.  There was no real information in the attack,
       merely unthinking slanderous paranoia.  Please, learning to
       read implies a responsibility to learn to understand: IFNA
       is not by any means the commercialization of FidoNet, it
       does not mean mandatory fees, etc.  Please read on.


               The IFNA project is now somewhat damaged.  That was
       a very preliminary proposal, and way too early for such
       exposure.  It was not meant to be public, it was way too
       early.  They were ideas of the top of our collective heads,
       as everyone involved realized.


               What is IFNA, and why?

               If you have been a FidoNet sysop long enough, you
       may remember the flap over the net/node reorganization
       during the summer of 1985.  There were complaints that
       "things are working fine, why mess with it?"  The assertion
       was true, at the time it was running quite smoothly, before
       we changed it.

               At that time the net/node changeover, a major upset
       and organizational change, was made for "the future".  You
       may have noticed that that future is here now; if you will
       think back, you will realize that the entire nodelist then
       was smaller than some of today's nets.  At that time, the
       reason for the change was the lack of hierarchy in the
       network; now we have nets that completely run themselves.
       Today's FidoNet with almost 700 systems, runs smoother and
       more efficiently, with less national bureaucracy, than it
       did two years ago.

               There has never been, is not now, and if I can help
       it never will be any sort of ideological or moralistic
       influences in the net administration.  What a sysop does on
       their board, short of illegal or outright damaging actions,


       Fidonews                   Page  2               27 Jan 1986





       is totally and completely their own business.  This idea was
       not talked about, merely implemented, and it permeates
       through the entire organization to this day.  Please realize
       through all of this that the FidoNet, as it exists, is
       totally and completely decentralized as much as is
       practical.  I don't think that many people realize just
       exactly what this means, or how it came about.


               Since FidoNet is totally and completely
       decentralized, it makes large scale operations and changes
       difficult to say the least, never mind trying to pull off
       some coup that no one would cooperate with!  Those that
       designed FidoNet in this fashion are amongst those that
       understand this fact best.


               And now, I'll cover some specific points in the
       attack.  I will not grace all of them with comment.

               The IFNA proposed "membership" does not mean that
       Fido sysops, users, networks or anyone is forced to pay for
       anything, period.  The "membership fee" is proposed to be
       for services and goods provided above and beyond what we all
       have now; seriously, how on earth can anyone in FidoNet make
       anyone else do anything?

               To illustrate this fact, pick a node from the node
       list, far away, where you don't know anybody, and demand
       that the sysop pay you $50 every year.  Good luck.


               A printed publication mailed to your home costs
       money.  A full or part time employee to maintain the
       nodelist and other related functions costs money, and yes,
       things are getting to that point.  Once again, because
       things are moving very smoothly, you normally don't see the
       effort behind the lines.  (I am not talking about myself, I
       do not have anything whatsoever to do with running the net,
       thank Ken and Sally Kaplan for most of that.)

               "Advertising" things such as the radio amateurs'
       FidoGrams, or individual sysops' services to the deaf is not
       "exploitation".  It is informing people of a service that
       they probably didn't know existed.  And how could we
       "exploit" a service that we do not perform, and have no
       control of?  FidoGrams and such are done by individual
       sysops, on their own machines, in their own living rooms.
       The assumption also was that all efforts here would be done
       or directed by the people involved in it.  Like I said, the
       proposal was brainstorming, and incomplete.


               The "magazine" (really just a newsletter, but called
       "magazine" to avoid confusion with FidoNews) is not meant to
       compete on the newsstands; it is meant for FidoNet users and
       sysops, and others only secondarily.  Similar to the
       position of Boys Life to the Boy Scouts of America, if you


       Fidonews                   Page  3               27 Jan 1986





       are familiar with that.  And yes of course it is proposed to
       have some of the better articles from the electronic
       FidoNews; ask any potential author if they would object.
       Compensation and such is yet to be determined, and will
       depend on income, of course.  Like I said before ...

               I'll be damned if I can think of how having a
       printed mag could hurt anything, except the ones putting up
       the dough for printing it.  It will explain how new sysops
       can get started, a list of Fido phone numbers for new and
       existing users, general interest articles, and infinitely
       more.


               As to objections to users "...  knowing how
       economical and easy ...", since FidoNet mail is there, and
       is the WHOLE POINT of FidoNet, and justification for writing
       it in the first place, we have an obligation to let non-
       sysop users know what it is and how to do it.  It does not
       mean you have to do it on your particular board.


               The attack on "...  assigning policy, rules,
       guidelines and procedures for FidoNet" is foolish; what do
       you think we do now?  The national network time slot,
       utility programs (LISTGEN, nodelist formats), coordinating
       FidoNet packet format between the various authors (Fido,
       SEAdog, Rover/gateway, FIDOUSER, etc etc), generating
       nodelists, and so on fall into this category.  It has to be
       done, it's done haphazardly now, just ask anyone using the
       Fido .MSG format about attribute bits.  You think this falls
       from the heavens, fully formed and ready to go?


               The idea of a FidoNet itself is unlikely as hell, an
       "International FidoNet Convention" isn't quite so unlikely,
       since I just came back from one.

               "Old FidoNews' on diskette or hardcopy, fees to be
       set." Yes fees, for IFNA to issue them in that form, of
       course!  You can still download them!  I don't see why all
       of a sudden that would just go away.  [ed: it wouldn't]

               Insurance proposals, like I said, this was brain-
       storming, it may very well turn out to be a waste of time.
       Just an idea, sorry!

               However, as far as "working with computer
       manufacturers to obtain discounts ..." that's not quite the
       same thing.  How many FidoNet sysops have US Robotics
       Courier 2400's?  I'd bet 90% of all the 2400 baud modems you
       see in the nodelist are USR's.  And why?  Because USR made
       the special offer to FidoNet sysops *FIRST*, that's why.  It
       IS a good modem.  Are there any objections to that sort of
       thing in the future?

               As to the tacky doggie: yes, the artist is quite
       aware of the proposed deal, since it is me.  Except those


       Fidonews                   Page  4               27 Jan 1986





       who purchased my old FidoNet bumper stickers (hopelessly
       amateurish) you have not seen the dog.  We do not propose to
       sell ASCII character strings.  It may be egotistical, but
       I'd like to have a Fido sweatshirt, as a matter of fact,
       I've been asked to make some, so I am anyway.  Unlike car
       insurance, no one will be required to waste their money on
       one.

               Junk mail: the proposal says "controlled (ie.
       voluntary) mailing list".

               "Political action committee": just an idea, there
       are people rumbling about this now, IFNA should support it.
       It is obviously in our interest, there are people there now
       supporting us, we might as well support them with numbers of
       organized sysops and users.

               "...  library of FidoNet utilities ..." no,
       obviously, it does not mean exclusivity.  The phrase "BBS
       DISTRIBUTED" tells it all.  Our proposal was for prepackaged
       diskettes, with docs, to benefit the authors, IFNA, and the
       customer who did not care to download large amounts of
       utilities at random to find what they want.  More on this
       later, when the proposal is complete.


               "To provide a liason between FidoNet and public
       service activities."  To get "... discourage efforts of
       others ..." from this paragraph is impossible.  It just
       isn't there.


               "IFNA would be the exclusive distributor of an
       Authorized Distributor package ...".  Right now, Fido
       Software (me) is the exclusive distributor.  If you are not
       aware of it, I sell Fido/FidoNet to paying customers.  And
       allow it for download.  I do not allow others to sell it.
       My customers are businesses and individuals who do not want
       to download, or who did for evaluation purposes, and now
       wish to have the manual and update services.  To those who
       run a Fido as a public service, both individuals and
       companies, it is free.  It has been this way for years;
       please read POLICY1.DOC.


               There are other points that I'm just not going to
       bother to touch.  I gave credence to a lot of it be merely
       mentioning it.  That was not my intent at all, but it was
       unavoidable.


               Both Ken and I have spent large sums of our own
       money to help run FidoNet and keep it all together in the
       last few years, never mind the hundreds of hours of work
       involved by many, many people in the last few years.  Please
       refer to page INTRO-4 in Fido's Operating Manual.  It's just
       the tip of the iceberg.



       Fidonews                   Page  5               27 Jan 1986





               IFNA's only task is to run the net independently of
       any personalities, and take over the many tasks of
       documenting and running the net.  It needs to generate
       income to pay for it's operation, and to provide the
       services proposed, not all of which are in the proposal that
       leaked out.  It is not a way for any of us to skim money
       from any sysops or users of FidoNet, and I am sorry for you
       if you believe that.

               Not everyone is out to screw you, this is not a TV
       show, there is no cloak and dagger business here.

            If you do not have space problems on the hard disk that
       Fido calls home - this is not for  you  (go  read  the  next
       article).  If  you have trouble keeping hard disk space then
       FAS is what you need.

            FAS,  can decide with a little help which files on your
       board  are  not  active  and  archive  those  inactive files
       releasing that valuable space for the next great utility  or
       game or whatever.

            FAS  will  read  your  sysop.log  files and extract all
       downloaded or uploaded files for as far back as you have log
       files for.  These will  become  your  active  file.  If  you
       desire  to  keep  some  files even though they have not been
       uploaded or downloaded these can be placed in the  permanent
       file and will never be archived.

            You  tell  FAS  which file areas to look at for archive
       purposes.  All files in those areas will be archived if they
       are not in the active file or the permanent file.

            The Archive process will copy  the  files  to  diskette
       then delete the FILES.BBS entry. Don't worry FAS can recover
       any  file once it is archived.  All Files archived will have
       the FILES.BBS description placed in the ARCHIVE file area so
       that the files can be restored.

            FAS is menu driven  and  is  complete  with  hard  copy
       reports.  FAS requires an IBM or compatible, 256k of memory,
       and  around  400k  of disk space for programs and files.  Oh
       yes,  FAS is fast.  FAS is distributed  under  the  Freeware
       concept.  Try it, you will love it.

            Call  the  following  Fido's for more information or to
       see the ARCHIVE file area and to download your space saver.

                          FIDO DISTRIBUTION LIST
                              15 January 1986

       This  list  was  compiled  from  responses  to  a proposal I
       submitted  to  the  FIDONEWS.   I  know   there   are   more
       distribution  nodes  than this,  but these are the ones that
       responded.  My thanks to those of you listed  here.  If  you
       are a distribution node,  and would like to be added to this
       list, send the relevant information to the SYSOP on 109/74 -
       The Bear's Den.  I will release updates to this list as  new
       distribution nodes are added.

                      Some more thoughts on Shareware

       I couldn't help thinking  about  a  problem  that  confronts
       those  of  us  who use shareware in an institutional setting
       when I read the article which mentioned the  personal  check
       sent   in  from  an  MCI  employee.   I  work  for  a  state
       university;  under  state  law  we  must  have  a  bill  for
       everything.   Some   producers   of  shareware  have  formal
       invoices already enclosed with the documentation; others ask
       for a donation.  I don't know if the  latter  group  doesn't
       want  to  appear  pushy  or  what;  the  fact  is  that many
       institutions  cannot  pay  on  this  basis.   A  suggestion:
       include  an  invoice  in your documentation,  or on your pop
       screen that appears when your program is invoked without any
       parameters.  Many of us would like to help out  but  cannot,
       at least through our institutions.

                  An update on what's happening with this
                    brainstorm about a new type of BBS

                          By John Plocher, 121/90

           I  must have touched a responsive chord somewhere!  I've
       gotten so much responsive mail pertaining to my ideas  on  a
       packet  interface  to  remote  systems  that I guess another
       Fidonews article is in order!

           Just a note of warning: I should in NO WAY be considered
       an expert on this subject,  in fact I didn't  know  a  thing
       about  packet  networks  6  months ago.  If anyone out there
       knows more about this than I do, please feel free to correct
       any misconceptions I have!

           'Nuff of this humble introduction.  On to  the  meat  of
       this note: There is a "standard" out there concerning packet
       switched   networks   called   CCITT   X.25.   This   is  an
       international standard which is/should  be  used  by  common
       carrier  packet networks (Tymnet,  etc).  There is a variant
       of this protocol called X.PC,  which is X.25 for micros.  It
       was  developed  by  McDonald  Douglas/Tymshare,  the  parent
       companies of Tymnet. The protocol specifications and related
       documentation is available for no charge from:

               X.PC Protocol Specification (Version 2.1)
               Tymnet/McDonald Douglas Network Systems 2710 Orchard
               Parkway San Jose, CA 95134

           Tymnet  also  has  a complete implementation for the IBM
       PC, including source, object, and documentation on an IBM PC
       disk for $20.00 - See  the  documentation  BEFORE  you  send
       money!  I  have  requested all of the above materials,  they
       should be here by the end of January (1986, I hope).

           X.PC specifically implements the NETWORK and DATA layers
       of the ISO-OSI model.

           At this point I need to clarify some points.  These have
       to do with what comes to mind when using the terms "BBS" and
       "interface".  I am working  on  developing  a  packet  level
       interface  which  could  be  used to implement a new type of
       BBS,  or other remote access system.  Any BBS  has  to  have
       some  sort  of interface to the remote user;  right now Fido
       uses a character level interface for user I/O and  a  packet
       level interface for file transfer.  I'd like to implement an
       interface which is 100% packet level, 100% of the time.

           Since  the  current  generation  of  BBS's  are designed
       around a single channel character level interface, a new BBS
       would have to be written to take  advantage  of  the  multi-
       channel packet interface.  Thus the notion of a new BBS.

           The  issue  of  security  has some relevance here,  too.
       Fido was designed to be a 100%  secure  system.  That  means
       that  even  if  a  user would upload FORMAT.COM,  s/he could
       NEVER execute it.  It also means that the user can never get


       Fidonews                   Page 10               27 Jan 1986





       past the Fido software  interface  and  into  the  operating
       system  (The  Sysop can,  though,  with the 0 command).  The
       result is that the users are limited  to  whatever  features
       Fido cares to let them use.  RCP/M systems on the other hand
       are typically not secure systems,  because the user has  the
       ability to execute programs in addition to the usual message
       oriented BBS commands.

           It  should  be  obvious  that  the issue of security has
       little to do with the interface used  to  do  I/O  with  the
       user.  Fido  and  RCP/M both use character level I/O;  it is
       what they do with it which determines the  security  of  the
       system.  The  ideas  I  am interested in ignore the issue of
       security completely (at least for now), and propose a packet
       level interface to the system which would be  a  replacement
       for  the  character  level interface used by Fido and RCP/M.
       (UNIX people will note that UUCP,  CU,  and TIP also have  a
       packet   type  interface,   instead  of  a  character  level
       interface.  In the case of CU,  the packet interface is used
       in such a way as to give the impression to the user of being
       a character interface.)

           If  security  is desired (and it will be for ANY type of
       BBS),  it would have to be  added  on  top  of  this  packet
       interface  in the same was as it is added to current systems
       on top of the character level interface.

           Note also that I have avoided mentioning anything  about
       the  physical  connection  to the packet interface.  In many
       cases, it would be a RS-232 async link through a modem,  but
       it could also be a synchronous bi-sync link to another local
       system,  or  a connection to a LAN,  etc.  The beauty of the
       packet interface is that it doesn't matter how  the  packets
       actually get from place to place, as long as they get there.
       They  don't  even  have  to  get  there  undamaged,  cuz the
       interface takes care of requesting a new packet if it  finds
       a damaged one.

           I  have  also gotten a few responses about my mention of
       Wendin's PCUNIX and their Operating Systems  Toolbox.  I  am
       still  (1/13/86)  waiting for my copy of PCUNIX,  but I have
       the OST and PCVMS.  For those of you who like VMS on  a  DEC
       VAX,  PCVMS  is  quite  similar.  It is truly multi-user and
       multi-tasking;  I don't like VMS,  and I liked PCVMS.  These
       products  are  only available for the IBM family (PC,XT,AT),
       but quite a few people here in southern Wisconsin have  been
       pestering Wendin to port it to the Rainbow, so if you pester
       them too...  Anyways,  back to the topic,  I am working with
       Wendin in developing X.PC as a network interface to the OST.
       This is a necessary first step in implementing all of  X.PC,
       if  the  virtual circuit ideas are to be implemented at all.
       (The multi-tasking is vital!)

           Getting  more  into  the  ideas   of   a   BBS   system,
       specifically  conferencing systems,  David Dyer-Bennet,  the
       Sysop  of  14/341  (The  Terraboard)  had  some  interesting
       comments  about  how  to present an understandable view of a
       discussion tree to the user.  At a minimum,  the user  would


       Fidonews                   Page 11               27 Jan 1986





       have  to  be able to see an overview of all the conferences,
       as well as details on individual conferences,  all  the  way
       down to the actual messages.  His conclusions are that ideas
       used  in  the outline processors now available could be used
       to present an outline of a discussion;  allowing the user to
       increase or decrease the amount of detail displayed.

           I'm getting a bit long winded here, so I'm going to call
       it  quits for now,  but if the response to these ideas keeps
       up I'll have to  write  more...  (And  I  thought  I  was  a
       programmer, not an author!)

       Version 1.06 of the Generic Adventure Game System released!
       -----------------------------------------------------------

       [Background: The Generic Adventure Game System is an
       adventure-game development system for 256K MS-DOS computers.
       It allows you to create your own computer adventure games
       using a fairly simple syntax and a standard text editor.
       GAGS 1.0 was released as Shareware in late August, and the
       previous version, 1.05, was released in October.]
                                  -- Mark J. Welch,
                                     sysop, Fido 125/459


          I have finally finished adding features to the Generic
       Adventure Game System, and have also released an interactive
       editor which allows game writers to view and alter room,
       noun, and creature definitions.  Alas, I am unable (or
       unwilling) to commit to future enhancements, because I plan
       to divert my energies to other projects.

          I will soon be delving into Modula-2 (GAGS was written in
       Turbo Pascal) and may decide to redesign GAGS in that
       language, but I can't promise anything, since I have several
       other projects in mind as well.  I will, of course, correct
       any bugs that may be noticed in GAGS, but currently do not
       plan to add new features for a long time, if ever.

          GAGS has progressed somewhat since its initial release in
       August.  For example, Everard Cheney, sysop of the Fantasy
       Factory of Pacifica, CA (415-355-6047, Fido 125/applied)
       wrote an interactive editor useful to enter new room,
       creature, and noun information. In response to his
       inspiration, I wrote another editor which is more useful in
       examining and making minor changes to existing games (and
       games in various stages of development after startup).

          Both of those editors are included, along with the GAGS
       "engine" program, a sample game, and extensive
       documentation, in GAGS_106.ARC, a 279K file. (GAGS_106.ARC
       also includes the ARC452.DOC file since I've discovered that
       no one bothers to download it when they download ARC452.EXE
       from my board).  The 279K file expands to about 450K, so it
       won't all fit on one 360K floppy disk.

          GAGS was reviewed favorably in the December 6, 1985 issue
       of *MicroTimes*, a tabloid publication distributed in
       California.  I've not heard of any other reviews, but would
       appreciate feedback if someone notices a review in a
       publication. I sent out a bunch of review copies to
       magazines I don't subscribe to.

          As before, I also offer the program on disk for $10
       (including postage), and will put a copy of the GAGS_106.ARC
       file in the mail to any sysop who sends me a disk and
       postpaid return mailer. Since it's Shareware, I encourage
       people who find the program useful to become registered
       users by sending me a $15 contribution.  Registered users
       may also elect to buy the complete source code (in Turbo


       Fidonews                   Page 13               27 Jan 1986





       Pascal) for $25 (including postage).

          A note on Shareware returns: For those who are curious,
       Shareware contributions have not been very substantial for
       GAGS. I hadn't expected much, of course, but I am most
       irritated by people who call with support questions and
       start off with a lie: "I'm sending you a check for
       registration, and I think GAGS is great, but how do you...."
       After about a dozen of those calls, I received one of the
       promised checks. I've received a number of other checks in
       the mail, but my expenses still outweigh my income by more
       than an order of magnitude. I doubt I'll elect to distribute
       my next product as Shareware.

          Another irritation: I've received at least five phone
       calls from people who complain that the program doesn't
       work. My immediate response is, "Did you read the READ.ME
       file?" and the answer has always been "no" since the READ.ME
       file explains why the program won't work unless CONFIG.SYS
       has upped the number of files.

       [Note: A bug in version 1.06 was discovered: the game's
       introductory text was not displayed. This bug has been fixed
       in version 1.06a.  That bug did not effect the game in any
       other way. mjw, 1-17-86]



       Changes from version 1.05 to 1.06               01-13-86
       of the Generic Adventure Game System            MJW
       -------------------------------------
       There are three new features in version 1.06 of GAGS.

       GAGS 1.06 is now finished. Included with it in the 279K ARC
       file is EDITGAME 1E, an interactive room/noun/creature
       editor.


       1) Verb synonyms

          I have not added User-definable verbs, but I've come
       halfway. You can now define a new verb as a synonym of an
       existing verb. For example, suppose you want the user to be
       able to type "inspect" instead of examine. In the .DAT file,
       you include a verb redefinition as follows:

       VERB
        EXAMINE INSPECT
       END_VERB

       During the game, any time the player types "inspect" as a
       verb, it will be translated to "examine." You may only map
       one synonym to each verb. You may include several
       redefinitions in a single VERB...END_VERB entry, but each
       pair of verbs must be on a separate line.


       2) Winning a game


       Fidonews                   Page 14               27 Jan 1986





          Okay, I give in. There is now a way to win the game.
       There is a now a new ROOM attribute called GAME_WIN, which
       indicates that the player wins the game when s/he enters the
       room, regardless of points held.  The ROOM_DESCR information
       is displayed, so you should use the ROOM_DESCR information
       to present the game winner with praise, etc.


       3) Creature time threshholds

          For those who think the creatures are too tame, here's a
       quick fix.  The normal "THRESHHOLD" value indicates how many
       times the player has to attack a creature with the wrong
       weapon before the creature attacks and kills the player.
       Now, there is a new attribute called TIME_THRESH, which is
       the number of turns after the player enters a room before
       the creature kills the player.  Setting this to 1 would be
       instant death. If you do not specify a TIME_THRESH value,
       the player need not be concerned about time. To set a time
       threshhold, put the line

       TIME_THRESH n

       in the creature definition, where n is the number of turns
       the player has to try to defeat the creature. I strongly
       advise that you use a number like 7 or 8, for this.

       ------

       Note 1: Version 1.05 of GAGS fixed a bug in the way
       creatures acted. In earlier versions, friendly creatures
       blocked exits; the change allows players to exit rooms
       without killing friendly creatures.

       ------

       Note 2: Yes, GAGS runs on any MS-DOS computer. I've not had
       firm feedback on 1.06, but 1.05 was confirmed to run on the
       Sanyo 555, the TI Professional, the DEC Rainbow, an S-100
       system with an 8086 card, and on the PCjr and a large number
       of IBM-compatibles. While I describe it as a 256K program,
       it runs fine in a 192K partition under DESQview.

                     A (Possibly) Better Way to POLL

                                    by
                                Bob Hartman
                            Sysop Fido 132/101
                             The UN*X Gateway
                           and Home of Rovermsg


       How many FIDO sysops out there have been having a hard  time
       using the new FIDO command POLL?  From personal experience I
       know  that it is more than just a few of us.  I have devised
       what I think is a slightly  more  robust  way  to  use  this
       feature, so let me share it with you.

       First  of  all,  this  method  is  for use when you are only
       supposed to poll on certain days (for example,  Saturday you
       are  supposed  to poll for the NODELIST).  The problems with
       POLL usually have to do with the fact that to POLL only on a
       certain day, you have to create a different FidoNet schedule
       which just gets executed on that day,  and  has  the  proper
       POLL  statement  in the ROUTE.<tag> file.  To say the least,
       this is a real hassle.

       My solution is to simply  not  use  the  POLL  statement  at
       all!!!  I know that this sounds ridiculous, but hear me out.
       I propose only using the PICKUP keyword.  Place this in your
       normal ROUTE.<tag> file,  in place of the POLL.  Then on the
       days when you are supposed to  POLL,  simply  use  ROBOT  to
       create a dummy message,  with a dummy file attached to avoid
       the normal message routing (I use the message "Just  to  let
       you know I picked-up the xxxxxxxxxx file").

       What does this do?  Well, all of a sudden you have a message
       going  to  the  node  you  wanted to POLL.  This causes your
       board to call that node,  and since you have PICKUP in  your
       route  file,  your  node will attempt to PICKUP the mail for
       you.  The two methods are equivalent in that either way  you
       get  the mail you were supposed to get.  The differences are
       subtle, but *VERY* important:

       1. Using the PICKUP method you  will  transfer  one  message
          which  will actually appear on the receiving board.  This
          is a minor drawback in my opinion.

       2. Using the PICKUP method you do not have to  run  separate
          FidoNet schedules on different nights (and hence not have
          to  pull  your  hair  out  trying  to  find out which one
          executes first!).

       3. This is the biggie ---  Using  the  PICKUP  method,  your
          board  will  continue to try to do the pickup every night
          until it succeeds!!!  Since you have a  message  destined
          for  the  other  node,  Fido  knows  whether  or  not the
          transfer succeeded.  If it was unsuccessful (phone  busy,
          other node off-line,  etc.),  then the next night it will
          try again.  This is the major advantage of  this  method.
          I  find  it very useful,  and wish that some of the nodes


       Fidonews                   Page 17               27 Jan 1986





          polling my board would  implement  it  (HINT,  HINT).  It
          means  that if you miss a poll,  the message will not get
          duplicated the following  week,  and  have  two  of  them
          waiting in the queue.  Since the files people are polling
          me  for are about 100K long,  this advantage becomes very
          important.  Who wants to pay to transfer  the  same  100K
          file twice in one session???

       Anyway,  I  have  been  using this method myself for about a
       month.  It took me that long to convince  myself  that  this
       method  had  no  drawbacks  and did work at least as well as
       POLL.  I hope this helps others  that  are  having  problems
       missing scheduled POLLs.

       I am looking for some type of accounting system that could
       be used by an outgoing host to keep record of what systems
       are sending messages.  This would enable the outgoing host
       to "bill" the other nodes for usage.  Anyone have something
       like this already written?  If so can you please send mail
       to David Dodell, Sysop at 114/15.  Thank you.

       Steve Butler, sysop FIDO 17/0 (aka 138/3)

       KILLROBT v2.0 is now out.  Included is a version compiled
       under GENERIC TURBO 3.0.  This version is more in tune with
       the need to run in batch mode.  The list of deleted messages
       can now be redirected (via DOS) to a file.  The repeated
       prompts for a valid path are no longer done.  The program
       terminates with an error message.

       Further enhancement requests should be sent to FIDO 17/0
       c/o Steve Butler.

       Thank you for your encouragement.

       PS: For those of you who use ROBOT to distribute files for
           PICKUP by others and must manually delete those who
           weren't (as in the weekly NODELIST); KILLROBT will help
           you automate that function.

                       MENSA National PC-SIG Forming


       We are interested in the possibility of forming  a  national
       MENSA  PC-SIG  (general  Personal  Computing,   rather  than
       limited to IBM PC).  If anyone  on  FidoNet  belongs  to  an
       existing  local  MENSA  computing  SIG,  or  would  wish  to
       participate in a national SIG (you must be a MENSA  member),
       please  let  us know.  Among the activities we envision is a
       MENSANet.  Other ideas are welcome.

       Please reply by FidoMail to me or Jim Kay at 109/612

       Reason  : PC-DOS 3.1 using SHARE

       Thanks to Gee Wong (Fido 107/312)  a  major  bug  has  been
       corrected in PRGUSERS.  The problem would crash the program
       under PD-DOS 3.1 while using the SHARE utility.  If you are
       using  PRGUSERS  and  plan  on  using SHARE, or already are
       using SHARE and see that PRGUSERS does not run, version 1.3
       will run under this envionment.

       Version 1.3 is available on Dec_Ware II, Fido 107/2
