                            ARC?  What's an ARC?

        I don't know if you know it or not, but we're the guys who 
        wrote ARC.  I don't mention this to brag or anything.  It's 
        just that I've made a few interesting observations that I'd 
        like to share with you.

        [The real truth is that I'm stuck for a topic this week.]

        I've been told that everybody who's anybody has ARC by now.  
        I hope so, since Ben Baker is using it to compress the node 
        list.  Mostly I get told this by people who want me to use 
        ARC to compress the newsletter.  

        For some strange reason this bothers me.  It was written 
        first and foremost as an archive utility, with compression 
        being added later.  I guess I just have a problem with the 
        idea of a one-file archive.  At least one person told me 
        that he used ARC on every single file on his board.  I don't

        think I could do that.  Among other things, I'd be afraid 
        that my users would think I was getting pushy or something.

        I don't think I'd use it on the newsletter anyway.  Partly 
        because I don't want to seem pushy, but that's not the only 
        reason.  While every Fido sysop might have ARC by now, I 
        don't know if every Fido user has it.  Supposedly this thing 
        is for users as well.  I suppose Fidonews is really mainly 
        for users, since they certainly outnumber the sysops.  I'd 
        like to think that they have a good chance of being able to 
        read it.  

        It's done us some good in a couple of ways, though.  We've 
        gotten some good advertising out of it.  I had occasion to 
        call a bureau chief for one of the computer trade magazines 
        not long ago.  He paused for a few seconds after I announced 
        myself, and said, "You guys wrote ARC, didn't you?"  One or 
        two of those can make you feel pretty good.  But most of our 
        clients (current and potential) don't seem to use bulletin 
        boards much, so it doesn't cut much ice with them.

        In truth, we've gotten much more out of it than I ever 
        expected.  We've gotten alot of free advertising, which 
        might not always help, but certainly doesn't hurt.  And much 
        to my surprise, we've even gotten some donations.

        I'm afraid I'm a bit cynical about human nature.  We 
        released it because we didn't really think it would sell 
        well enough (if it cost money) to pay back the costs of 
        marketing it.  We made it "freeware" because that doesn't 
        cost any extra.  I personally never thought we'd see a dime 
        from it.  When the first check came in, we were astounded.  
        We were torn between cashing it, and framing it.  (We 
        compromised; we cashed it and framed a Xerox copy of it.)  
        So far we're up to about $300, and even have a couple of 
        letters asking about site licensing.

        So maybe it will take off yet.  Maybe in a few months checks 
        will be pouring in, and we'll be making decent money on the 
        thing.  Maybe NASA will invite me to go on a shuttle flight.  
        Maybe my partner will be elected President in a write-in 
        campaign.  Somehow I doubt it.

        But I hope I'm wrong.  I hope it does work.  Not so much for 
        the money (well, the money would be nice too), but because 
        I'd like to think that freeware is a viable concept.  I'd 
        like to think that a guy with a good idea can succeed on a 
        shoestring.  I have very little faith in human nature, but 
        I'd really like to be wrong.

                   "Fido BBS Christmas Wish List (Early)"


             Here it is, the first of October, and the leaves have 
        just begun their yearly metamorphosis to the colors of Fall.  
        At least, that is how it is down here in the South.  Why, 
        you may ask, am I submitting my Christmas wish list now?  
        Why not wait until a more appropriate season?  Why not wait 
        until there is a chill in the air and all of the leaves are 
        on the ground, if indeed not snow?  Well, like everything 
        else in this world, a "wish list" needs time to develop and 
        grow.  As Fido Sysops, we already run perhaps the finest BBS 
        software in the land.  But could it be improved?  And 
        indeed, SHOULD it be improved?  The answer is a resounding 
        YES!  A program that is not improved is yesterday's news and 
        tomorrow's relic.  Fido has been constantly improved as we 
        have all seen.  It is up now to version 11 now, and there 
        have been quite a few improvements over the old version 10.  
        But is this the best we can do?  I think not!  The list that 
        I am submitting below contains some things that I, as well 
        as many Fido users, would like to see become a part of Fido.  
        Kind of an "early" Christmas list of sorts.  I'll bet  some 
        of the things on MY list are on YOUR list, too!  Let's take 
        a moment to compare our notes and see what we have.  Tom, if 
        you're listening, you could be our big old Santa Clause and 
        make our Christmas dreams come true!!  


                                 "THE LIST"


         1.  Give the user a choice of what kind of screens he'd 
             like to see by adding code to support ANSI graphics.  
             Just as RBBS-PC (grrrr...) gives the user a choice of 
             screens, so should Fido!  It would be easy!  If the 
             user says he wants ANSI graphics, then access a file 
             called WELCOME1.ANS, otherwise, access WELCOME1.BBS as 
             usual.  Same for all the other panels on the system.  
             By setting a binary flag at logon in reply to a 
             question, the user could be presented a consistent set 
             of graphics or non-graphics screens!  

         2.  Give the sysop the ability to have the CHAT bell also 
             ring the printer bell.  The chat bell by itself is hard 
             to hear unless you happen to be very near the computer.  
             I have myself missed many a chat because I could not 
             hear the bell.  If you sound the printer horn at the 
             same time, then it would be a little easier to hear, 







FIDONEWS     --           14 Oct 85  03:02:41           Page 4

             and I wouldn't miss near as many users requesting to 
             chat with me!  Many times a user will give up using the 
             system in frustration because he cannot get the help he 
             needs when he needs it the most!  

         3.  The ability to configure our systems to support 
             specific baud rates.  For example, Fido will now 
             support 300, 1200, and 2400 baud (and maybe others that 
             I am unaware of).  Some sysops prefer to limit their 
             systems to only 1200 baud access, or 1200 and 2400 baud 
             access.  This is particularly true within companies.  
             Perhaps Tom could assign a set of switches.  For 
             example one switch would enable 300 baud, another 1200 
             baud, and yet another 2400 baud.  Then, a Sysop could 
             decide which baud rates HE wanted to support!  

         4.  Automatic baud rate sensing is needed.  Instead of 
             having to whack the carriage return or the space bar 
             (depending on the modem you have), why not take a 
             lesson from the RBBS-PC folks and automatically 
             determine how the user is connected?  Shouldn't be that 
             difficult.  The method is already available by simply 
             studying the latest RBBS source code.  Then we would 
             not have to have the new user sit there, connected, and 
             not know what he is expected to do.  I personally have 
             seen MANY a new BBS user sit there connected to my 
             system, unsure of what he is supposed to do, only to 
             get frustrated and drop carrier without ever seeing a 
             thing of my BBS!  

         5.  This wish concerns the Fido Newsletter.  I would like 
             to see a Table of Contents, listed on the front page!!  
             It would be NICE to be able to find the issue that I 
             was interested in WITHOUT having to thumb through every 
             single back-issue looking for that ONE article of 
             interest.  By creating a TOC on the front page, all I 
             or anyone else would have to do is just browse the 
             front page!  The ARPANET newsletters are done this way, 
             so I think perhaps we should take a lesson and do the 
             Fido Newsletters in a similar manner!  

         6.  I would like to see a better security system for Fido.  
             I can already hear someone out there moaning, but think 
             about it a moment.  Users tend to use the same password 
             on every system they log onto.  If some turkey finds 
             out what your password is on one system, then he has 
             access to every other BBS that you visit as well!  
             Other than stating policy (that no one reads), there is 
             no good way to make sure that passwords are revalidated 
             from time to time.  My suggestion would be to put a 
             flag in the user file for each user, and after say, 60 
             days, warn him at his next logon that he has to change 
             his password THAT session, or be locked out of the 
             system (or be converted to TWIT access, or something 
             along those lines).  This would force users to at least 
             periodically change their passwords in an effort keep 
             "BBS crashers" at bay.  By not allowing a user to 







FIDONEWS     --           14 Oct 85  03:02:43           Page 5

             change his password to his "current" password, he would 
             be forced to use something different that a crasher 
             would have a hard time keeping up with.  Many 
             commercial systems (VM, MVS, etc) have this kind of 
             security, and it seems to WORK!  There are other checks 
             of the new password that could be made (not his first 
             or last names, city or state, etc), but this basic 
             method would do much to keep our systems secure!  I 
             realize that we are NOT talking about main-frames here 
             ... these are Personal Computers.  But just take a look 
             at most of the BBS's in this country today and compare 
             them to, say, 2 years ago.  They are now BRISTLING with 
             security (or attempted security) because of what 
             "crashers" have been up to!  

         7.  Have Fido check for mail ONCE for ALL AREAS when the 
             user first log on, rather than when he tries to go into 
             a new message area.  Many users have told me this is 
             irritating.  They had rather be asked ONCE, and TOLD 
             ONCE, rather than have to keep on answering questions.  
             Even if this creates a short delay while all the 
             message bases are checked, most folks agree that this 
             would be more desirable than constantly being quizzed 
             about whether or not to check mail.  

         8.  A better SYSOP_xxx.EXE program, that when run remotely, 
             would give a DECENT display.  The current version 
             writes all over the screen when the SysOp is in REMOTE 
             mode, and is very difficult to use!  

         9.  This one might be considered part of number 8 above.  
             Might it be desirable to have a tidier way to access 
             the user file while ONLINE (a SysOp command)?  There 
             are times when it sure would be NICE to NOT have to 
             drop down into DOS and that you COULD maintain the user 
             file while logged on normally!  



        Well, those are my wishes for now.  I will probably have a 
        few others before Christmas, and if I do I will publish them 
        here.  I would like to see what kind of wishes the rest of 
        you out there have regarding Fido.  As I said, Fido is 
        probably the finest BBS software that a Sysop could run.  
        Tom Jennings has MUCH to be proud of as Fido's creator.  He 
        is a prime example that you CAN teach an old dog new tricks!  
        He does in every release!  Maybe he'll be able to teach Fido 
        some of the "tricks" that comprise my wish list, and perhaps 
        he'll include some of YOUR favorite wishes!

                                I'M TIRED

        Yes, I'm tired.  For several years I've been blaming  it  on 
        middle-age,  iron-poor  blood,  lack    of    vitamins,  air 
        pollution,  water  pollution,  saccharin, obesity,  dieting, 
        under-arm  odor,  yellow  wax build-up, and  a  dozen  other 
        maladies  that  make  you  wonder if life  is  really  worth 
        living.  But now I find out, tain't that.  I'm tired because 
        I'm  overworked.    The  population  of this country is  200 
        million.   Eighty-four million are retired.  That leaves 116 
        million to do  the  work.    There are 75 million in school, 
        which leaves 41 million  to  do  the  work.   Of this total, 
        there  are 22 million employed  by  the  government.    That 
        leaves 19 million to do the  work.   Four million are in the 
        Armed Forces, which leaves 15 million to  do the work.  Take 
        from that total the 14,800,000 people who work for State and 
        City  Government  and  that  leaves 200,000 to do the  work.  
        There are 188,000 in hospitals, so that leaves 12,000 to  do 
        the  work.    Now  there are 11,998 people in prisons.  That

        I've always wanted to be a Sysop, and
        when I found out that Elite Software
        needed someone to run there Fido
        (117/1262) I jumped at the opportunity
        to do it! Well I just Might have jumped
        in over my head. I knew it took alot of
        time and effort but not as much as I'm
        putting in.   What really makes this
        board a hassle though is the fact that
        it is NOT AT MY HOUSE! other words all
        the work I do on it is by over the phone
        lines and the one day aweek I go in to
        work on it.  One of the most common
        questions I get from one user is "how do
        I down load to a c-64?" What I usually
        tell him is that he has to use ascii
        (depending upon what comm program he
        uses of course), then this user comes
        along and uses xmodem to down load a
        file he can't even use if he has a c-64.
        Of course I've had my share of obscene
        messages with a few adressed to me (of
        course). I have reason to believe they
        where left by the ex-sysop who didn't
        know how to run the system and was
        fired, but I have nothing to go with so
        I can't prove it.(sigh) Anyway I've had
        alot of fun running there Fido Call it
        up we've go a 10 meg with alot of util
        programs!

        I have to take exception to the comments about setting our
        Fido clocks back to Standard time at the end of the month
        and then not changing them to Daylight time again.

        An accurate date/time stamp is quite an important audit
        trail in keeping track of files. True the user cannot easily
        access the system time, but the sysop sure needs to know
        when things are created. (We are hoping to install a
        concurrent DOS product so as to be able to get double duty
        out of our system, and this would make the date/time even
        more meaningful.

        Rather than have the wrong time for SIX months out of the
        year, why not have the wrong time for one DAY. The FIDO's
        could change their clocks on FRIDAY, before the Saturday AM
        mail schedule, thus accomodating the corporate users
        mentioned in the editorial, and keeping the clocks accurate
        for the rest of the time.

        I would request that the powers that be in St. Louis
        consider such a plan. They would have to decide whether the
        confusion of changing early would be less than the confusion
        of having nodes miss mail time on SUNDAY AM, due to not
        having changed the clocks....

        Still More Adventures of Luke Vaxhacker          Episode n+3

            When  we  last left Luke,  the Milliamp Falcon was being 
        pulled down to the open collector of the Imperial Arem  Star 
        Workstation.   Dec  Vadic  surveys  the  relic  as  Imperial 
        Flunkies search for passengers...  

            "LS scan shows no one  aboard,  sir,"  was  the  report.  
        Vadic was unconvinced.  

            "Send  a fully equipped Ncheck squad on board," he said. 
        "I  want  every  inode  checked  out."  He   turned   around 
        (secondary channel) and stalked off.  

            On board the Milliamp Falcon,  .Luke was puzzled.  "They 
        just walked in, looked around and walked off," he said. "Why 
        didn't they see us?" 

            .Con smiled. "An old munchkin trick", he explained. "See 
        that period in front of your name?" 

            .Luke spun around, just in time to see the decimal point.
        "Where'd that come from?" he asked.  

            "Spare  decimal points lying around from the last time I 
        fixed the floating point accelerator," said .Con. "Handy for 
        smuggling blocks across file system boundarys,  but I  never 
        thought  I'd  have to use them on myself.  They aren't going 
        to be fooled for long, though. We'd better figure a way outa 
        here." 

        -------------------------------------------
        At this point (.) the dialogue tends  to  wedge.  Being  the 
        editor  and  in  total control of the situation,  I think it 
        would be best  if  we  just  sort  of  gronk  the  next  few 
        paragraphs.  For those who care,  our heroes find themselves 
        in a terminal  room  of  the  Workstation,  having  thrashed

        several  Flunkies  to get there.  For the rest of you,  just 
        keep banging the rocks together, Guys. --Ed.
        -------------------------------------------

            "Hold on," said Con.  "It says we have  'new  mail'.  Is 
        that an error?" 

            "%SYS-W-NORMAL,  Normal,  successful  completion,"  said 
        PDP-1.  "Doesn't look like it.  I've found the inode for the 
        Milliamp Falcon.  It's locked in  kernal  data  space.  I'll 
        have to slip in and patch the reference count,  alone..." He 
        disappeared through a nearby entry point.  

            Meanwhile, RS232 found a serial port and logged in.  His 
        bell started ringing loudly.  "He keeps  saying,  'She's  on 
        line,  She's  on  line',"  said  3CPU.  "I  believe he means 
        Princess LPA0:.  She's being held on one of the  priviledged 
        levels." 

        ----------------------------------------------------------
        Once again, things get sticky,  and the dialogue suffers the 
        most damage. After much handwaving and general flaming, they 
        agree  to  rescue her.  They headed for the detention level, 
        posing as Flunkies (which is hard for most hackers) claiming 
        that they  had  trapped  the  Bookie  executing  an  illegal 
        racket.  They  reached  the  block  where  the  Princess was 
        locked up and found only two guards in the header. --Ed.
        -------------------------------------------------------

            "Good day, eh?" said the first guard.  

            "How's  it  goin',  eh?" said the other.  "Like,  what's 
        that, eh?" 

            "Process transfer from block 1138, dev 10/9," said Con.  

            "Take off,  it is not," said the  first  guard.  "Nobody 
        told us about it, and we're not morons, eh?" 

            At this point (.), the Bookie started raving wildly, Con 
        shouted  "Look  out,  he's  loose!"  and  they  all  started 
        blasting PROMs left and right.  The guards started to  catch 
        on  and  were  about to issue a general wakeup when the PROM 
        blasters were turned on them.  

            "Quickly, now," said Con.  "What buffer is she in?  It's 
        not going to take long for these..." 

            The  intercom  receiver interrupted him,  so he took out 
        it's firmware with a short blast.  

            "...guys to  figure  out  something  is  goin'  on,"  he 
        continued...  

        TO BE INTERMINABLE...
