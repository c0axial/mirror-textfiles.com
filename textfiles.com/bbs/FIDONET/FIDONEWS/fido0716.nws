     * Fairplay or Foulplay
     Jeff Aldrich (1:161/515)
     Peter K. Johnson

                 Our Right To Access Information:
                       Fairplay or Foulplay

     Many, and I hope most, of the FidoNet boards in California
     have received a file named FAIRPLAY.ZIP over the past ten
     days or so.  This is a text file containing a proposed
     Constitutional Amendment to the California Constitution.

     OK, so what?

     Well, if you and your users print and sign this petition, the
     people of California will have the opportunity to give
     themselves a Constitutional Right to access specific information
     on the California legislature in "computer-readable" format.  It
     is the first initiative of its kind in the nation and if it
     qualifies for the ballot, citizens of other states can use this
     as a model for reforming their government.

     Why send this political stuff to my BBS?

     Because you and your users are the citizens this Amendment
     will benefit the most.  Besides, this is not about politics.
     It has very little to do with politics.  It has EVERYTHING to
     do with the way we govern ourselves.  This Amendment will
     plant the seed of Information Age Democracy in America and
     help make the "Decade of Democracy" a reality for all of us.

     Why amend the Constitution to gain this access?

     It's not likely to happen any other way.  Politicians know the
     power of electronic information.  The only electronic data the
     "public" can access by law in electronic format today is the
     voter registration rolls of each county.  Why?  Because
     politicians need to access this information to get re-elected.
     No other data access is granted, by law, to the citizens of
     California.  And efforts to curb our access, like the FCC
     surcharge battle a few years back are expected to continue.

     As a fellow sysop, what can I do?

     Your users follow your lead and suggestions.  Post a bulletin
     on your BBS pointing out the need to take action.  Let them
     know FAIRPLAY.ZIP is available on your board and what it can
     do for all of us.

     FidoNews 7-16                Page 2                   16 Apr 1990


     Where can I get more information?

     Californians for Responsible Representation (CRR), (a ballot
     measure committee, ID#892099 Richard L. Noble, Treasurer), are
     forming an echomail conference precisely for this purpose.  The
     echo will provide a forum for your users to comment and
     participate in discussions about this ballot initiative.  CRR
     is willing to distribute this echo to all California area codes,
     so any BBS in California willing to carry the echo in their
     local calling area has easy access.

     Who should I contact to get this echo?

     If you contact Jeff Aldrich at 1:161/515, you will be informed
     of any boards in your area that already carry the echo.  Or, if
     there are no boards in your area that carry the echo, you will
     be given information regarding a FidoNet board that will feed
     the echo directly to you.

     Where else may I find information?

     CRR will have an ad in the Western Edition Wall Street Journal
     on April 20, 1990, to launch this electronic citizen petition
     drive state-wide.  In addition, FAIRPLAY.ZIP has a READ.ME file
     containing a release form that will allow CRR to publish your
     name and/or BBS phone number in newspaper ads in your local
     area.  If you would like to help make the "Decade of Democracy"
     a reality for all the people of California, please print the
     release form and snail mail it to the address within the file --
     today, if possible.

     So what does all this really mean?

     FidoNet is an amazing resource that has been vital to the growth
     of personal citizen-to-citizen telecommunication.  This
     initiative provides the opportunity for California FidoNet
     sysops to continue this leadership -- by helping the people of
     California gain the Constitutional Right of public access to
     government information in data format.  This ballot initiative
     places the power of electronic citizen oversight of our
     government in our collective hands.  People all over the world
     are fighting for democracy.  Isn't it time we join them...

     Thank you for helping our future,

     Sacramento State University

              *  Time For Real Democracy in "Our" Network!


     Proposal:

      ALL coordinators be  voted on by the part of the population they
      serve at a regular interval.  I propose the minimum to be yearly
      and the maximum to be every  two years that this should be done.
      A minimum  requirement  for  canidates - be  that  they  have at
      least  one  year  active  consecutive  membership (listed in the
      nodelist)  in FidoNet.  Coordinators should not  serve more than
      a  specified amount of consecutive terms  (for example if  terms
      are  yearly  no  more  than  four years  should  one person hold
      a coordinator postion) and Special considerations should be made
      as in the  case of  smaller local Networks *if* other  canadates
      are unavaliable.  Network coordinators  should be  selected  and
      voted  on by the  local  network. Regional Coordinators be voted
      on the Net Coordinators  and so on.  This is basically how it is
      now but,  only if a  position  comes open.  I  propose  that the
      original  reason a  coordinator  held thier  postion  until they
      became otherwise  unable or unwilling to  fulfill it is null and
      void.  Originally  the  size of the  Network demanded  that  for
      operational proceedure  once a coordinator took a position, they
      enact that position until they either quit or left the  network.
      Now,  with the  present size  of the  Network the postion should
      be the  will of the people (in our case SysOps) and shared as an
      elected postion.


     BackGround:

      Every  organization  that I have  ever belonged  to or  heard of
      never  let a  supreme  dictatorship  develope.  Yet here  in our
      hobby, there is no regular vote for Coordinator postitons.  This
      basically places a  monarch in power.  Is the Job of Coordinator
      for Life?  In many places,  such as my local Net,  the Hats  are
      always  "passed".   No  one  has  the  opportunity  to  "select"
      leadership.  This is not fair for the NetWork SysOps or the Net-
      Work as a whole.  Since the Coordinator currently empowered sets
      the guidelines ..if democracy is not part of thier picture it is
      not there.

      Often when a select group of people get and remain in power they
      tend to  loose interest  and the  worst that can  happen is true
      apathy in network affairs.  Back when  I first joined FidoNet, I
      heard  about the  "good ole boy  Network". I Never really under-
      stood that until not too long ago  there was a  minor Net war in
      our local Net with oposing groups. I have no beef with Volunteer
      Positions,  Its just that more SysOps should have an opportunity
      to serve thier community.

     Effect:

      At  network  level  it is  a boon.  It  allows  others to become
      involved  with the  support  of the  local Network.  This can be
      healthy,  It allows  support for  members of the  Network by the
      Network on  All  levels.  It keeps Apathy  out of our ranks  and
      keeps inovation and  growth in the  Network from the  local  Net
      level on  up.  I  am not  writing  this  to upset current coord-
      inators.  I  communicate  regularly  with  other Network  coord-
      inators  and  feel  there are  quite a  lot of  good  SysOps and
      Coordinators here in FidoNet.

      I know,  I know,  There are possibly a few  SysOps  out there to
      argue on specific grounds. True it does take certian "equipment"
      to be a REC or  more specifically to be  involved  with  massive
      amounts of  Echo mail or compiliation  of the Nodelist and such.
      But hey, lets face it, we all started  somewhere and  with a few
      "fail-Safes  (reqiremets)" in place any special requirements can
      be taken care of.  Remember  nothing  is fool proof - especially
      our  current situation.  And, I am sure the  candle manufactures
      ralleyed against electricity at one time also <grin>.

      There is yet  another arguement  that with  elected coordinators
      become a populatiarity contest.  It seems other clubs, hobby and
      amature groups deal with this quite well. Are the current coord-
      inators so  parinoid that we can have no progress in FidoNet?  I
      would much rather have a undesirable Coordinator for a year than
      a lifetime. With a voteing mechanism and requirements it is more
      than  highly doubtful that a totally  unprepared or unrelaliable
      SysOp will get a job which requires a reliable system. There are
      special  cases  and  considerations  to be  made.  But  there is
      *always*  someone interested in the Network and helping it grow.
      It is healthy to get more folks involved. It is obvious that the
      larger the  Local Network the more advantageous this is to allow
      the  position to be  shared among interested SysOps.  This keeps
      dictatorship out of our Network.


     Outcome:

      A net  we can  ALL  be more  involved in.  It should be clear to
      each  and  every coordinator  that they have the  support of the
      SysOps they serve. It is true  it is a voluntary postition.  All
      the more  importance  to have the support of members of the Net-
      work.  This also keeps Apathy  out of our Network.  And why not,
      every year we have a  FidoCon?  We should, every year, elect our
      coordinators to serve us. If a  SysOp is suitable and the SysOps
      of a Nework  respect  them and thier  accomplishments in the Net
      they will undoubtly be voted in. This is how it should be - with
      the support of the Network.  I have heard quite a bit of talk of
      moving in this direction. Isn't it time we made it reality.

                  REGION 17 FIDO CONVENTION

     FidoNet Sysops  and  their  families  and  friends  are cordially
     invited  to  attend   a  Region17  convention  hosted  by  Net105
     (VanPort;  aka "Home  of  the  Curmudgeon") July 27-29 at Menucha
     Camp  and Conference Grounds.   This  will  be  the  only  "Fido"
     convention on the West Coast this  summer;    guests  outside the
     boundaries of Region17 are more than welcome to attend.

     Menucha  was once the summer home of  Julius  Meier,  founder  of
     Meier & Frank department stores and a former  Governor of Oregon.
     "Menucha" means "waters of refreshment" in Hebrew and is  an  apt
     description  of  the unique natural setting - 98 acres of  lawns,
     woodlands  and gardens - high on a bluff overlooking the Columbia
     River.   The  main buildings were constructed around 1914 and are
     historical  sites.    Recreation  includes  a  75x30  ft  outdoor
     swimming  pool, regulation tennis  court,  basketball,  horseshoe
     pits, a surfaced volleyball court,  table  tennis,  and biliards.
     There are also numerous trails for hiking.

     Menucha  is located in Corbett, Oregon  -  30  minutes  from  the
     Portland International airport and about 45 minutes from downtown
     Portland.  Freeways I-84, I-5, and I-205 are close by.

     Oregon  also  offers an exceptionally unspoiled seacoast and  the
     Cascade   mountain  range  (including  Mount  St.    Helens,  the
     recovering active  volcano  in  nearby  Washington)  within  easy
     driving range of  Portland.   Portland's Saturday Market features
     arts and crafts by  local artisans;  the Oregon Museum of Science
     and Industry specializes in "hands-on" exhibits.

     Convention prices are extremely affordable if you register before
     May  15th.  Menucha offers dormitories  and  family-style  meals,
     with a few semi-private and private accomodations.   For example,
     for  an  adult  FidoNet  Sysop  who elects to  arrive  on  Friday
     afternoon, sleep in his sleeping bag in a dorm,  and stay through
     Sunday  morning,  the  cost  is  a  mere $70.50 (meals included).
     Reduced prices apply to children, students, and spouses.

     For more information and registration forms, NetMail Ken Zwaschka
     @ 105/54 or Janet Murray @ 105/23.
