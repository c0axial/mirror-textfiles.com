                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================

                            A call for articles

          For the  past several  months, the  bulletin board community
     has  been  filled  with  discussions  on  the  recent  SEA/PKWare
     lawsuits.  Rumors  have  flown  through  many  of  the electronic
     conferences with people both defending and accusing SEA. With yet
     another round  starting up  with the second lawsuit, I'm going to
     try something.

          In two weeks, there is going  to  be  a  special  edition of
     FidoNews.  It  will  focus  on  the  SEA/PKWare  lawsuits.  I  am
     currently soliciting  articles from  both Phil  Katz (PKWare) and
     Thom  Henderson  (SEA).  In  addition  to these individuals, I am
     asking for the opinions  of everyone  reading this  editorial. In
     order  to  make  it  easier,  I pledge to do everything within my
     power to make every submission acceptable to MakeNews. As long as
     you get me something close to specs, it will go into this special
     edition. Send them in  as files,  as messages,  disks through the
     mail. If  I can  determine how it was made, and can convert it to
     straight ASCII, I WILL print it.

          Why am I doing this? I'm primarily doing  this because  I am
     quickly becoming disgusted with the behavior of my fellow sysops.
     I've heard many of  the facts  about the  first case  and believe
     that SEA's  actions were  the correct  and honorable thing to do.
     While some of  the  reason's  on  the  first  lawsuit  were first
     reported in FidoNews, many seem to have missed the article or are
     choosing to ignore it. The bulletin  board community  has a right
     to  feel  concern  over  this  issue,  but  before  we  all start
     condemning  individuals,  let's  make  sure  we  have  the facts.
     FidoNet is meant to help communication, and to me this means that
     we find out the  facts instead  of flying  off the  handle. If it
     turns  out  that  many  of  my  fellow sysops and their users are
     willing to turn a blind eye to the truth, then it will be my turn
     to pass  on the  flame. I  can not  stay in  a network should the
     network at large feel inclined towards injustice, it  will become
     my time  to leave the network. So write your opinion, send it in,
     make you position public knowledge.

          What is my opinion? Find out in two weeks...

     PACKET RADIO PROJECT IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS NEEDS HELP

     A  high school teacher in the L.A.  area,  working with the
     National  Science Foundation and the JPL,  is setting up  a
     program  to  network schools together using  amateur  radio
     packet nets.  Assistance is needed immediately from amateur
     radio  operators  or others with the appropriate  interests
     and  backgrounds to help install,  maintain,  and  instruct
     teachers on the usage of these nodes.  The network is even-
     tually expected to be worldwide.

     To  become  a volunteer,  or to get  information  on  using
     packet radio in your school, contact:

      Owen Robbins
      9340 Friendship Ave
      Pico Rivera CA 90660

     EMAIL SYSTEM FOR BLIND NEEDS PROGRAMMERS, DOCUMENTERS

     Talking  Dog is a personal FidoNet-compatible  emailer  for
     the blind which uses a speech synthesizer,  being developed
     in  C  using existing source code as much as  possible.  TD
     will be public domain.

     The TD project has immediate need for:

      +   Source code in C (preferably MicroSoft) for a  message
          reader/writer  that can shell out to the user's choice
          of editors.

      +   C programmers (again,  preferably with MicroSoft  com-
          pilers)  to  complete the modifications to  the  other
          utilities being used.

      +   Experienced  document  writers,  preferably with  some

     INVITATION TO JOIN ECHO FOR KIDS

     All teachers,  and sysops with children between the ages of
     "old enough to type" and 12th grade are invited to partici-
     pate in the KIDS echo.  This echo is for pen-pal activities
     between kids,  and for parents and teachers to also join in
     the fun and to communicate with each other. At 50+ messages
     per day,  this is one of the hotter echos around.  About  2
     months ago,  it went international to Australia and Canada.
     A link to the UK is also in the works.

     To participate in this echo, contact Paul Witherspoon, KIDS
     echo coordinator, at 1:383/6.

               Fredric L. Rice Warns of Nuclear Disasters
                     In FidoNews Volume 5, Number 36
                           (5 September 1988)

               Written September 10, 1988 by George Falcon
                             Sysop 1:109/648
                           "The Falcon's Rock"
                Hub of the MENSA and MWM Echo Conferences

       As someone disappointed in seeing the growth of the world
     population without maintaining growth in awareness of our planet's
     needs, I'm sorry to see that Mr. Rice has chosen the anti-nuclear
     argument to defend.  The argument against nuclear power could be
     made a great deal more potent without the numerous inaccuracies
     in his article.

       Mr. Rice omitted the source of his expertise.  I cannot claim a
     degree in nuclear, mechanical, electrical, chemical, or civil
     engineering, in physics or health physics.  In fact, I cannot yet
     lay claim to any degree at all!  I was impressed, therefore, when
     I was able to see so many obvious faults in the text of Mr. Rice's
     article on a topic for which he is so obviously unprepared.  Surely
     there must be less expensive ways to make oneself appear foolish
     than to purchase a computer and invest hundreds of hours and
     dollars to write a weak article like his.  At the very least he
     should have named as closely as possible the sources of his
     information.

       I work for a large computer services company in support of the
     Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Office of Nuclear Reactor
     Regulation.  I maintain the staff files, produce the staff input
     reports, and input the data from those reports into the IBM Model
     3090 mainframe which the NRC leases from the National Institutes
     of Health.  I have seen the time each of these engineers spends in
     resolving each tiny aspect of each plant's operation (whether
     power or nonpower).  I am, for this article, and for the sake of
     clarity and accuracy, taking sides with the nuclear industry.
     Please remember, though, that I would much rather we were using
     a source less hazardous to life on this planet.

       In reading Mr. Rice's article, aside from numerous misspellings,
     I noted the following items to which I take exception:

     1.  On page 5, he says, "There are a bewildering number of
     nuclear reactors strung along the California coast line."
     I find it difficult to understand why Mr. Rice would be bewildered
     by trying to count to four.  That's how many operational nuclear
     power plants there are in the state of California.

     2.  There are basically two types of reactors:  Boiling Water
     Reactors (BWR's) and Pressurized Water Reactors (PWR's).  Mr.
     Rice does not mention the second type, but there are power plants
     in which the nuclear fuel simply pressurizes, rather than boils, the
     water.  Most people say that water "changes phase" when it
     becomes steam, rather than saying that water "expands" into
     steam, as Mr. Rice does at the bottom of page 5 and top of page
     FidoNews 5-38                Page 5                   19 Sep 1988


     6.

     3.  On page 6, paragraph one, line 12, Mr. Rice that "the Atomic
     Energy Commission will allow leaky fuel rods to remain in
     operation until the rad count rises to well above the legal limit."
     The engineers here would be breaking to law to permit such
     operation.  If Mr. Rice knows of such a violation and fails to
     notify the Department of Justice, wouldn't he be an accomplice?
     I suspect that he doesn't know of any such violation, probably
     because there aren't any.  In addition, the Atomic Energy
     Commission was reorganized fourteen years ago.  The
     responsibilities carried by the AEC have been borne by the
     Nuclear Regulatory Commission since that time.  Has Mr. Rice
     been doing his research in a time capsule?

     4.  Page 6, para. 4:  I think what Mr. Rice was aiming for when
     using the word "pourve" in the second line was the acronym
     "PORV", which stands for Pressure-Operated Relief Valve".

     5.  In the next paragraph, second line, Mr. Rice gets the National
     Rifle Association involved in this conspiracy... either that, or he
     meant to put "NRC" in there instead of "NRA"... but if he knew
     that the NRC was the responsible agency, how does the Atomic
     Energy Commission fit into Mr. Rice's story?

       The balance of Mr. Rice's article could be based on as little
     information was displayed in the first few pages, and less, since
     he wisely points out on page 7, para. 3 that he'd "...like to detail
     an event which could occur at the San Onofre power plant which
     would by no means be typical."  I enjoy fiction, Mr. Rice, but I
     prefer it when it's based on reliable facts.

       A man who works around the corner from me as a supervisor in
     the Performance Evaluation Branch of NRR was nice enough to
     take the time to review Mr. Rice's article and comment on it for
     me.  He said that it was like someone who puts together a human
     being with the head coming off the hip... the parts may be
     working right, but they're not put together in a form that makes
     sense.  Mr. Rice demonstrates the old axiom, "You can't believe
     everything you read" quite aptly.

                        System Enhancement Associates
              Policy Statement on ARC Trademark and Copyrights


     Many of our users have expressed concern regarding use of the
     ARC trademark and copyrights.  To better meet their needs we
     have formulated this Statement of Policy, effective as of
     September 13, 1988.  This policy applies to anyone who does not
     already have an agreement with us.


     In the interest of serving the needs of the bulletin board
     community and supporting the shareware concept, we pledge to:

      o  Maintain the ARC file format as a stable industry standard.

      o  Continue to upgrade ARC for speed and efficiency.

      o  Continue to distribute ARC as a shareware product, and
         continue to allow for its free non-commercial use.

     Futhermore, we pledge to foster the ingenuity and creativity of
     our fellow shareware authors, whom we are happy to support in
     virtually every manner.



                                    ARC

     To protect the rights of our shareware licensees, ARC may be
     freely copied and distributed subject to the following
     conditions:

      1) No fee may be charged for such copying and distribution.

      2) ARC may only be distributed in its original, unmodified
         state.

      3) ARC may not be distributed, in whole or in part, as part of
         any commercial product or service without the express
         written permission of SEA.

      4) ARC may be made available for download by pay bulletin boards
         and similar commercial services provided that no additional
         fee is charged specifically for downloading ARC.



                               ARC TRADEMARK

     Use of the ARC trademark may be licensed subject to the
     following terms:

      1) Any use of the ARC trademark means that the product is
         SHAREWARE.  We need a fully functional copy of the latest
         version with documentation to make available on our BBS for
     FidoNews 5-38                Page 7                   19 Sep 1988


         general download.

      2) Your product must be compatible with the current version of
         ARC from SEA, and must be of an acceptable level of quality
         and workmanship.

      3) We must have your name and address so that we can keep you
         informed on any changes to ARC.

      4) As the legal owner of the ARC trademark, we are bound by US
         trademark laws to protect and maintain the integrity of ARC
         in any program that uses the ARC trademark .  To comply with
         this, we must ask for fully commented source code.  We will
         keep your source code completely confidential if you so
         desire, and we will not make use of any of your source code
         in any of our products.



                              ARC SOURCE CODE

     The ARC program sources have always been available for
     informational purposes.  They may be used freely in the creation
     of shareware utilities that examine the contents of an ARC format
     archive.  Any other use of the ARC source code is subject to the
     following terms and conditions:

      1) Your product must be SHAREWARE.  We need a fully functional
         copy of the latest version with documentation to make
         available on our BBS for general download.

      2) The first $100,000 worth of revenues is yours to keep.  We
         want 6.5% of any revenue above that in return for the use
         of our code.

      3) For the protection of our users, your product may not produce
         ARC format archives which are incompatiable with our current
         version of ARC.



                              ARC FILE FORMAT

      1) We hereby grant to the entire world and all sentient
         creatures in the universe who do not already have an
         agreement with us to the contrary a perpetutal, unlimited,
         galaxy wide license to read, extract, create, or otherwise
         manipulate ARC format archives.  This does not include any
         license to use our sources or trademarks.

      2) If you make any changes to the format such that your file is
         not compatible with the current version of ARC, then the
         result may not be referred to as an ARC format Archive.


     We feel that this Policy Statement is a fair and workable answer
     FidoNews 5-38                Page 8                   19 Sep 1988


     to all concerned with ARC format archives, developers and users
     alike.  If any developer is unable to comply with these terms,
     please contact us at (201) 473-5153 to discuss alternative

                      Yet Another Complicated Komment

                         Episode 10:  BBS Utilities

     Let's face it  --  there  just  isn't  any  easy  way to go about
     setting up a  customized  bulletin  board.    You've  GOT to have
     utilities.

     So, you say, what brought about THIS amazing revelation?  Well, I
     like to program, and lately  that  passion has carried into Turbo
     C.  And, as a SysOp, I finally  am  in a position where some neat
     little utilities would come in handy.  I've needed some utilities
     for my job, and, when needed,  I  write them.  But these were for
     ME.  Well; me and Opus.

     First came the need to  reset  those  darned  NON-OPTIONAL colors
     that Opus sets up  for  you,  assumedly  through ANSI.SYS, which,
     after leaving Opus, are  still  the  default  colors.  Light blue
     characters on a black background.    Way to go guys, I can hardly
     see it with my cheap CGA card and monochrome monitor.  So is born
     SC, the screen color setter (which  uses ANSI.SYS instead of some
     easier routes available).

     Now I can see the screen but can't see those nasty d'Bridge virus
     files in my Opus outbound directory;  FS, the File Search utility
     can list those system and hidden boogers, redirecting output to a
     file  to  be  applied  to  such  commands  as  MARK  (remove file
     attributes) and DEL (need I say more?).

     Oh, yes, we've gotten  rid  of  those  files, but what about that
     "painfully" verbose Opus.Log  file?   CYCLE OPUS.LOG OLYYMMDD.LOG
     and -- I now have a dated  filename  on  the log cycling -- which
     is, incidentally, archived and subsequently deleted.

     Once a day that log  cycle  gets  deleted,  but I have a hardware
     quirk in my system that forces  me  to  reboot right at midnight;
     WAITUNTL 23:59:59  during  my  before-midnight  event followed by
     REBOOT.  And to insure that other events that take almost no time
     at all won't be repeated?  DELAY 60 insures a 60 second event.

     Okay,  what  about  posting  FidoNews?    Well,  all  we  have to
     do here is CYCFNEWS  E:\FILE\FIDONEWS  -C10  -R and now there are
     only the latest 10 cycles of  FidoNews in the FidoNews file area,
     and only the latest one is unarchived, and in my case the -R will
     retain dated entries in the  FILES.BBS  for any FidoNews archives
     that have been removed from the directory.  Any FILES.BBS entries
     not pertaining to FidoNews are left alone.  Who needs utilities?

     =================================================================

     Don Daniels
     1:107/210


              Thanks to Greater Cincinnati Sysop Association

     As outgoing President of IFNA I wish to express both my personal
     thanks and the appreciation of the corporation to all those who
     participated in the Greater Cincinnati Sysop Association's
     FidoCon '88 Organizing Committee.

     It was very apparent that they put a great deal of effort into
     the many preparations for FidoCon.  During the year, I was very
     impressed with the professional and enthusiastic approach that
     they put into their work and it paid off with a conference that
     evryone I spoke to agreed was a productive success.

     Thank you:

               Tim Sullivan            Rick Ashworth
               Jesse Armentrout        Steve Sullivan
               Mark Walker             Decker Doggett
               Greg Hanfbauer          Bill Smith
               Pete Tyjewski           and anyone I may have missed!
