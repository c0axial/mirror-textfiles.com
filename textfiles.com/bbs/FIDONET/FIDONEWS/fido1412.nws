     =================================================================


     This Issue is packed with .ARTs from all over the world. I guess we've
     finally got the readership stirred up. [grin]

     But in the midst of all this input we lost something, namely: the uucp
     Gate at 1:13/10. Burt Juda no longer appears in any capacity in the
     FidoNet Nodelist. Why? And WHO was going to tell us? ZC1 was unaware
     of it last I asked. James Young and I have been discussing it in email
     for several days and his last communication from Juda appears later.

     This lack of communication in a network dedicated to communication
     mystifies this writer.

     What effect does this have on Internet gating or the fidonet.org
     domain? Is there now a NEW Guucp honcho? Who?

     Don't forget you can post info, answers, and articles et al, in the
     FIDONEWS Echo available everywhere. Otherwise, we will be waiting for
     input to next week's Issue for some answers/news.

     The Internet listings in the FidoNet by Internet Section now only
     include Region level and up listings. Net listings by Region are
     available on the FidoNews webpages listed in the Masthead. Personal
     sites may be linked to the FidoNet International WebRing also listed
     in the Masthead.

     The Region 14 page listing should read 'netins' instead of the

     Cash and Carry - Financing FidoFolks
     by: Clay Tannacore  (1:372/136)


        Just when you thought it was safe to start reading FIDONEWS again.
     I'm back!  This time with an unforgiving message to all of the Network
     FIDONEWS 14-12               Page 4                   24 Mar 1997


     EchoMail Coordinators, and the SysOps who have by way of their
     acquisitiveness damn near annihilated FidoNet.  These parsimonious
     individuals who have persuaded themselves that users, and/or EchoMail
     recipients have a reverential responsibility to pay for whatever they
     (NECs or SysOps) elect to charge for.  Some-how these weasels have
     decided that a federation such as FidoNet that was established as a
     network of hobbyists, should now (to suit their greedy souls) become
     the Federal Savings and Loan Association for Retarded (OOPs, did I
     misspell that last word?) SysOps and NECs.  This technique of self
     enrichment is a plague within the FidoNet community and requires
     immediate attention.  When I say "immediate action" I do not mean some
     co-conspirator *looking into it*, I mean every damn Regional
     Coordinator launching a extensive inquiry into this agendum.   I'm
     sure that this form of self enrichment has won the wide embrace of
     those who have profited by it, but the rest of us are witnessing the
     demise of our user base, and FidoNet as our parent organization.

        For those of you who are not familiar with what I have been doing
     in the most recent past.  I have for the last 76 days been researching
     complaints in reference to the charging of fees to users and the pay
     as you go fees charged for EchoMail (NEC's) distribution.  Be it known
     that I have only been able to accumulate statistics from 26 different
     nets.  This was accomplished by personal contact with various SysOps
     in those nets, and obtaining copies of their respective EchoMail
     policy documents.  Without elaborating on individual net policies, I
     will state that there are a number of bulletin board systems that
     charge a user fee (aka, a donation, registration fee, or voluntary
     contributions) for services that should (under POLICY4.) be free of
     any expense.  The proceeding statement includes access to FidoNet (and
     international) EchoMail, local EchoMail, files (sometimes shareware)
     including Copyrighted material.  As a matter of fact the greatest
     number of Pay-For-Access bulletin board systems, are nothing but
     illegal software distribution points, catering to those who want low
     cost (copyright infringements) programs.  However, to be fair about
     this statement, there are an abundant amount of boards that only
     charge for access to the Internet.  Something that is exclusively
     harmful and destructive in nature to FidoNet as a whole.

        There are correspondingly many Network Coordinators that are for
     reasons unbeknown to me allowing the Network EchoMail Coordinators to
     place monitory assessment in excess of the cost of providing their
     services to their nets SysOps.  The *buddy-buddy system* is
     widespread, and individual SysOps are being assessed amounts that can
     not be justified once telephone LD charges are reviewed.  A *buddy*
     may only pay a penance for the import of 30 or more Echoes while
     another SysOp who hasn't been initiated into *The Brotherhood* will
     have to supplement the NEC's coffers by paying (his FAIR share) 10 to
     20 times as much as an amigo, even though the SysOp only carries 4 or
     5 Echoes.  Don't get me wrong, there are a number of NEC operations
     that are completely within the parameters set forth in Policy 4.
     There are many NEC's that will for reasons justified to him, wavier
     the requirement of fees for certain systems.  I'm in one of those
     nets that do.  The NEC here (in the 372 Net) has allowed my system to
     operate without the burden on fees for EchoMail.  While my system
     only imports 3 national Echoes (totally for Disabled American
     Veterans) it is without a doubt a Godsend not to have to expend the
     FIDONEWS 14-12               Page 5                   24 Mar 1997


     extra bucks each month.  The trouble is, not very many other NEC's
     will do that.  They have an agenda to fill, along with their pockets,
     and wouldn't give a worthwhile cause the time of day, without an
     interest payment.  I have read over 19 of the local EchoMail policies,
     and without a doubt they all sound like a *financial statement*
     rather than a policy document.  Sometimes this is an attempt by the
     NEC to *explain* to the SysOp why he must help out financially, and
     what he will receive in return for his buck.  Nevertheless, there are
     policy documents that I have reviewed that are nothing more than the
     NEC's way of intimidating the SysOp's with refined threats.  Even in
     my own net, the policy document is little more than a business type
     financial proclamation.  There is a time and place for this sort of
     document, but rather than constructing a policy document laden with
     "what has to be paid", why not give a demonstration (factual, of
     course) of what it costs to operate for a month.  Surely this way
     will serve two purposes.  One, the SysOp gains an understanding as to
     why he is paying, and what he is getting for his money.  Two, there
     is a *full disclosure" of what is *really* spent for mail distribution
     and communications, leaving no undisclosed data to cause derogatory
     or speculative talk.

        Gentlemen what I have just expounded upon is true.  You know it,
     you live under it day by day.  You, (whether you are a user or SysOp),
     know the practices and circumstances I quoted above are factual.
     You've seen it in almost every net.  So, why not do something about
     it?  Let your Regional Coordinator know your feelings.  Have your NEC
     post in an open message base, his phone bill for the previous month.
     Maybe the last two or three months.  Get on the NC of your net
     relating to what you feel is an unjust and inequitable way you must
     support the EchoMail system.  One word of caution here.  When and if
     you do as I propose, be sure you have a valid complaint.  Talk to
     others in your net, find out their charges for their EchoMail.
     Compare the charges they are required to pay, and ask them to inquire
     of their friends as to their *contributions*.

     Solid Oak Software's extremist, fascist behavior
     Fredric L. Rice (frice@stbbs.com)
     The Skeptic Tank, 1:218/890.0.  (818) 335-9601
     http://www.linkline.com/personal/frice/index.htm

     Right-wing extremist groups operating in the United States have been
     using the rhetoric of "Save the children!" to advance their occult
     agendas for decades.  Now, with the help of technology, a new fascist
     business called "Solid Oak Software" has managed to rise above all the
     rest and get noticed.

     As described below, their Internet-access software limits the
     information that the company's leader -- Brian Milburn -- wants his
     customers to access.  Even though customers are told it "saves the
     children!" the company doesn't advertise [1] the fact that the parents
     who purchase the software have no say-so in what it will allow access
     to and what it will not; the buyer unthinkingly purchases the
     extremist bias of the company's leader.
     FIDONEWS 14-12               Page 6                   24 Mar 1997


     Indeed, it gets worse:  Mr. Milburn refuses to divulge the sites that
     the software won't access and has implemented very weak encryption to
     make sure that parents never learn about his extremist bias.  He gets
     upset when people publicly report on some of the sites that he doesn't
     want anyone to access.  (If he's embarrassed by his prejudices, he
     shouldn't expose them, I opine.)

     Buyer beware.

     As for myself, I've asked to have my web pages included in the list of
     banned sites.  The cult _does_ provide a highly valuable service to
     educational organizations like mine by limiting the access to their
     web pages to educated, intelligent people.  As more and more people
     become aware of what the software does, only people who share the
     company leader's bizarre bias will use it --and I don't want those
     types of people accessing my materials any way.  Do you?

     [1] This may change.  The company may have to start publicly admitting
     that customers can't select what they can or can not access (perhaps
     the company has already started.)  People who purchase Internet-
     censoring software have the right to at least know that in addition to
     limiting the access to pornography, the software also limits access to
     educational systems and charity organizations.

     CyberWire Dispatch // Copyright (c) 1996 // December 20
     Jacking in from the "Your Agenda is Showing" Port:

     Washington -- It's a long held maxim that technology is "agenda
     neutral." Until now.

     As an earlier Dispatch investigation proved, the so-called "blocking
     software" industry, praised for enabling parents, teachers and
     corporations to block porn from being sucked into the computers of
     those trolling the Web, often comes with a shrink-wrapped, encrypted
     agenda in the form of the database of web sites and newsgroups these
     programs actually block.

     Porn sites aren't the only ones blocked. Sites with decided political
     or activist agendas, such as the National Organization for Women (NOW)
     or animal rights groups, also are blocked.  Trouble is, these blocking
     software programs don't make this known to the user. For some
     companies, shedding a spotlight on their underlying agenda, makes them
     sweat bullets or foam at the ascii mouth. Such is the case with Brian
     Milburn, president of Solid Oak Software, developer of an insipidly
     named blocking program called "Cybersitter."

     When confronted with his agenda ridden software, Milburn isn't shy
     about it, indeed, he was outright indignant when he originally told
     Dispatch: "If NOW doesn't like it, tough... We have not and will not
     bow to any pressure from any organization that disagrees with [our]
     philosophy."

     So when Bennett Haselton decided to put a sharp edge on this subject
     by focusing on Cybersitter with laser like precision, Milburn went off
     FIDONEWS 14-12               Page 7                   24 Mar 1997


     the charts.

     Milburn wrote to Media3, the ISP that houses Haselton's website
     <www.peacefire.org>, saying he was adding the entire domain of Media3
     to the Cybersitter blocking database, in order to keep anyone using
     his company's product from gaining access to Haselton's article.

     Milburn ranted to Media3 that Haselton had made it "his mission in
     life to defame our product" exhibiting "extreme immaturity," by
     "routinely" publishing names of sites blocked by Cybersitter.  Milburn
     claimed that Haselton may have "illegally reversed engineered" the
     Cybersitter database. Milburn has threatened legal action. Haselton,
     however, found a white knight. After hearing about Milburn's actions,
     Mike Godwin, legal counsel for the Electronic Frontier Foundation,
     decided to represent him.

     In an Email to Wired News correspondent Rebecca Vesely, who wrote
     about Milburn's beef with Haselton, Milburn said he was swamped with
     "geek-mail" from Wired News' "loyal following of pinhead idiots."
     Milburn characterized Haselton, "an aspiring felon" and said that he
     had confirmation that Haselton was the "ghost writer" for the original
     Dispatch article that broke the story of the hidden agendas in
     blocking software.

     All this bluster over Haselton, an 18-year-old with too much time on
     his hands. If right about now you're thinking that Milburn should pick
     on someone his own size, well, he's already "been there, done that"
     and got his ass kicked in the process.

     You see, after the first Dispatch article, Milburn sent us a saber-
     rattling Email. His Aug. 15th Email claimed that "your willful reverse
     engineering and subsequent publishing of software code is a clear
     violation" of copyright law. And although he claimed he was sure he
     could win a case in civil court, he was instead seeking "felony
     criminal prosecution" by going to the FBI with his beef.

     I referred Milburn to my lawyers at Baker & Hostetler, who promptly
     pointed out that Dispatch hadn't been the one to hack the cybersitter
     database. Further, our article was "protected by the full force of the
     First Amendment," our lawyers said.

     And because Dispatch only published "fragments" of the Cybersitter
     database (a word used first by Milburn in his own threatening letter),
     such publication "fits squarely within the fair use provisions" of the
     copyright act, our lawyers reminded Milburn.

     Finally, Milburn was left to chew on this: "If you persist in accusing
     [Dispatch] falsely of copyright infringement and if you proceed with
     your ill-conceived threat to encourage the FBI to commence
     activities... you should understand that, unless the information you
     provide is accurate and complete, you and your firm may be incurring
     liability of your own."

     Not a peep has been heard from Milburn since he received that letter,
     until he decided to pick on the kid.

     FIDONEWS 14-12               Page 8                   24 Mar 1997


     Milburn is apparently operating in some alternative reality. His so-
     called "confirmed sources" about Haselton "ghost writing" our original
     story are utterly false.

     Haselton had nothing to do with our article. Dispatch obtained the
     cracked code of Cybersitter and the other programs we mentioned from
     an entirely different source. Haselton did nothing but build on the
     work of our original story, but never wrote a single word of the
     article nor did he provide us with the hacked databases.

     All of Milburn's heartburn has me confused. Rather than try and slay
     Haselton, he should pay him for the right to reprint his article and
     findings. Milburn makes no apologies for his agenda; indeed, he is
     proud that one of his major distributors is "Focus on the Family" a
     conservative Christian organization.

     And for people that brook with the conservative, straight-arrow family
     values ideals that Focus on the Family advocates, Cybersitter is the
     perfect fit. Indeed, this is the free market working at its best.
     Products spring up in direct response to demand. Cybersitter fits that
     model for a particular segment of the society. You may not like it; I
     certainly wouldn't use a product with this built in agenda, but nobody
     is making us buy it.

     You would think that Milburn would eat up such "negative" press and
     wear it like a badge of honor. But he is too petty; too small minded.
     And when he discovers that Haselton did nothing more than run
     Cybersitter through its paces, much the same way that a reviewer for
     computer magazine might, and then report the findings, he'll have
     nobody left to harass. I hope he doesn't have a dog he can kick...

     Have a Merry Christmas, Mr. Milburn. Peace on Earth, Good Will
     to Men.

     Meeks out...

     Cybersitter Goes after Teen
     by Rebecca Vesely

     8:00 pm PST 9 Dec 96 - A teenager who founded a Net anti-censorship
     group could face a lawsuit from the owner of the popular blocking
     program Cybersitter, Solid Oak Software, on grounds that he illegally
     obtained the list of sites blocked by the program.

     But the 18-year-old student at Vanderbilt University who founded
     Peacefire, Bennett Haselton, says that he merely ran the blocking
     software on his computer and kept track of which sites were blocked -
     such as the National Organization for Women, Mother Jones, and The
     Well.

     "According to our sources, he has engaged in illegal criminal
     copyright violations to further his juvenile teenaged political
     agenda, and reduce the effectiveness of our product," said Brian
     Milburn, president of Solid Oak Software.
     FIDONEWS 14-12               Page 9                   24 Mar 1997


     Solid Oak has added Peacefire to its list of blocked sites and has
     asked Peacefire's Internet provider, Media3, to remove Peacefire from
     its server. Milburn has also said he will block out all content Media3
     hosts if it does not remove Haselton's site.

     "It's pretty ironic that Cybersitter, which is supposed to help kids,
     is blocking a student-run organization," Haselton said.  Peacefire was
     founded in August and now has about 100 members, of whom the average
     age is 15 years old.

     Haselton wrote an article naming some of Cybersitter's blocked sites
     last month on the Peacefire Web site, but the site wasn't blocked
     until Friday, after Haselton contacted Milburn to discuss the
     company's blocking practices, Haselton said. The student was then told
     that Solid Oak had referred the matter to its legal department.

     "There was no way he could have known who was on our list without
     breaking into our system," said Solid Oak spokesman Mark Kanter.  "The
     filter had to be decoded by reverse engineering" - a process of taking
     a piece of technology and, without any knowledge of the techniques
     used to create it, making a copy.

     In an email written to Media3 on Friday, and forwarded to Wired News
     by Media3's administrator, Joe Hayes, Milburn said that Haselton "has
     made it his mission in life to defame our product," and warned that
     all content to Media3 - some 2,500 domain names -would be blocked on
     Cybersitter if Peacefire was not removed.

     "We realize this is an extreme measure and regret that our customers
     will no longer have access to any sites serviced by Media3. I am not
     sure if any of our current customers are Media3 subscribers, but as
     they will no longer be able to access their email and such, we will
     offer any affected customers complete refunds," Milburn said in the
     email.

     Hayes said Solid Oak has given him no proof that Haselton has done
     anything illegal, so he would not remove Peacefire, and noted that
     among the content on Media3's server is a Mayflower Society Bulletin
     Board and "everything to do with Pilgrims and Plymouth Rock." Hayes
     added that Media3's attorneys have been alerted to the situation, and
     if the ISP is blocked, it will take legal action. Solid Oak does not
     normally inform sites they have been blocked.

     Subject: Doomsday is only when you decide it to be.

     I have been a SysOp for 7 years.. and a member of FidoNet for 6 years.

     When I first joined the network, FidoNet's NodeList wasn't very large
     at all, in fact, it was puny compared to 1995. But the quality of
     messages was far greater and made up for the few nodes. The quality
     FIDONEWS 14-12               Page 10                  24 Mar 1997


     of FidoNet's messages even now is far higher than that of the
     InterNet, which has a gigantic amount of nodes that kills our count
     by a longshot. Quality far outweighs magnitude.

     Through my experience with the BBS world I have found that we have
     always struggled for our hobby. This struggle in many cases has faced
     the shut-down of our systems or networks in one way or another.

     During the years of 1994 through 1996, the number of BBSes grew by
     the thousands. But were ALL of these systems quality BBSes? In many
     cases no. It was until my second year as a SysOp that I learned what
     the true meaning of the word was. During that second year my Seagate
     ST251 MFM Hard Disk died, it literally burnt up the spindle motor as
     a result of a shot power regulator. I lost everything I had made of
     my BBS, which at the time had about 1000+ members and about 30 callers
     per day. All of this work was lost, and I knew there was no way I
     could retrieve it. It quite unfortunately went up in smoke, I came
     home one night and smelled burning epoxy in the air... and immediately
     feared the loss of my Bulletin Board System. After three long weeks
     and about twenty litres or more of Pepsi, I knew that I was a true
     SysOp...  I could not give up. I *WANTED* my BBS, I wanted to have
     that feeling that I was offering a free service to the public... I
     wanted to be respected for my efforts. My BBS stayed online until
     December 16th, 1995.. when I could no longer afford the bills to
     maintain my computer and the phone line. I felt like my life had
     ended, because it was and is still all that I have ever had. If it
     weren't for the BBS world, I would not have met my best friends, who
     have brought the best times of my life. I would not have known that my
     strengths lie in computers.  Forget the InterNet, anything can have
     Balloon Curtains and Fluffy Bunnies, but when there is slime packaged
     inside, it becomes unattractive very quickly. BBSes retain character,
     and quality.. and offer something the InterNet will never have,
     because of the commercialization and magnitude which the InterNet
     thrives upon; the FidoNet is a warm caring community, which is
     controlled and managed, this is quite clearly not shown on the
     InterNet. I worked for many months and finally paid all of my bills,
     and have put my system online only three weeks ago. "You're crazy!",
     "You won't get your users back!" people would say... But I know that I
     can bring them back, not the same users, but I will get back good
     users. That's all that will be left, and that's all I ever wanted.
     Back in 1995, the BBS world became more strongly oriented towards
     files and such, when it used to be communication and entertainment.
     The InterNet offers these, but they are abused and not managed. The
     BBS world is not shown on TV or flashed in newspapers only because it
     does not bring profit. That's the media for you, but I don't want that
     attention... I want to provide a means of communication which is
     precisely what FidoNet provides and always has provided to its clients
     and its clients users. Three weeks have passed since I put the BBS
     back online, and I already have over thirty users and eight calls a
     day average, which I am quite impressed with at this time.

     After all of the dust has blown off, the goodness of the FidoNet
     community will shine through and continue to be what it always has: An
     Icon to the connected world, a free service which has much higher
     standards than that of any commercial service. Those who remove
     themselves from the FidoNet Nodelist are quitters, I am not a quitter.
     FIDONEWS 14-12               Page 11                  24 Mar 1997


     Let all of those nodes drop like flies, but the nodes which remain
     will bring the great quality they have always provided to the FidoNet
     Echos.  And the users from those systems which drop, will call the
     systems which remain. And the BBS world will thrive once again... the
     way it should be.

     Fidonet's doomsday is not today, and I will not allow for it to happen
     tomorrow.

     Statistics are pointless, a curve of dropping nodes will not remain,
     as the number of users reverting to other systems will increase, the
     with-drawn node addresses will decrease. And there will certainly
     always be a BBS community, as long as there are people like me, and
     hopefully all those who read FidoNews.

     Followup to Pete Snidal's Fidonet/Internet Comparison
     by Dave Aronson, sysop of Air 'n Sun (1:109/120)


      PS>  FIDONET    Is a system of hobbyist-operated bulletin boards,

     Well, mostly.  To nitpick, there are some professional nodes.

     However, I feel that your point is basically correct and should be
     expanded upon.  The important part IMHO is that most Fidonodes are
     one-line DOS-PC dialups, operated from the sysop's home.  By contrast,
     an ISP typically has hundreds or thousands of lines, hooked to large
     computers, operated in a "machine room" in commercial space.

      PS> which connect and exchange data
      PS> regularly, usually on a nightly schedule.

     Where local calling is cheap, it's very common for high-traffic nodes
     to get an "unlimited local calling" line, and connect to local links
     whenever there is anything to send.

      PS>  INTERNET   Is a system of server computers, also spanning the
      PS> world,

     Or would that be "spamming the world"?  B-(

      PS> which are virtually connected to one another at all times.

     Not necessarily.  There are many that are only occasionally connected,
     but these do not generally host any of the "real time" services that
     most people think of when they think "Internet", like web pages and
     ftp directories.

      PS> The "Noise/signal ratio" of these echoes is quite low,
     FIDONEWS 14-12               Page 12                  24 Mar 1997


     So let's look into HOW this miracle is achieved.  It is in fact IMHO
     one of the most important differences, concerning day-to-day use.

     In Internet, almost all newsgroups are unmoderated -- any twit can
     wander in, say whatever he wants (not only off-topic chatter, but
     flames, trolls, ads, etc.), AND he can instantly spew it into every
     newsgroup in creation.  The only recourse is public pressure on his
     ISP, who may or may not be willing to do a damn thing.  (Usually not,
     so long as he pays his bills and doesn't generate too many complaints
     to ignore.)  There are SOME moderated newsgroups, but this is a very
     heavy burden on the moderator, as THEIR type of moderation means that
     the moderator must pre-screen each and every post for approval.

     Fidonet echoes, on the other claw, usually (always, in the case of the
     backbone) have a moderator, who is authorized to eject unruly posters,
     and if the sysop refuses, the moderator can have that entire node
     ejected from the echo!  However, it rarely comes to that, as the sysop
     has no vested interest in refusing, as he's almost certainly not
     getting any money from the user, nor does the sysop have support staff
     to deal with the complaints for him.  Also, it is impossible on most
     Fidonet BBSes to "crosspost", at least in the Internet sense of having
     the whole thread continue to be crossposted to all the newsgroups the
     original was in, barring manual intervention.

      PS> files of particular interest may even be "File
      PS> Requested" from other systems.

     ...though the sysop will have to pay for the call, and may require
     that the user reimburse the cost.

      PS> Sending of commercial messages in Fidonet is prohibited, and
      PS> "Spamming" - electronic junk-mail - is impossible.

     Not impossible at all... just MUCH more difficult, and of course our
     sysops are MUCH faster to DO something about it!  B-)

      PS> "Spamming" - the sending of electronic junkmail to your personal
      PS> email box - is seriously frowned upon, and sort of prohibited,

     Hunh?  There are currently no laws against it anywhere that I know of;
     the closest are some USA laws against junk faxes, but some courts have
     held that it doesn't apply to email.  Many ISPs have a clause against
     it in their Terms Of Usage (or whatever they call it), but most are
     very slow to enforce it.

      PS> but the fight with those who would capitalize on this resource
      PS> in this way is ongoing.

     Amen!  Americans, PLEASE lobby your Congresscritters to have the "no
     junk faxes" law extended to email!!!  Others, do whatever you can....

     By the way, I have thought up two slogans that I would like to get
     spread as widely as possible.  First, inspired by Woodsy Owl's
     admonition to litterbugs, "Give a damn, don't spam!".  Secondly,
     inspired by the reaction of a Vogon to Arthur Dent's struggles, NOT
     the Borg as some may think, "Resistance is UCE-less!".  (UCE is an
     FIDONEWS 14-12               Page 13                  24 Mar 1997


     Internet abbreviation for Unsolicited Commercial Email.)

      PS>  INTERNET   Allows access to the "World Wide Web."

     (Probably the biggest thing that helped the Internet explode in
     popularity with the Great Unwashed.)

      PS>  FIDONET    Costs the user nothing.  Free basic access is a
      PS> fundamental given on all Fidonet systems.  User support is
      PS> sometimes encouraged, but never demanded.

     True in, I'd guess, 99% of cases, but don't take it for granted that
     Fidonet means free.  Also, many nodes offer a basic level of service
     for free, but reserve some goodies for donors.  However, these are
     usually things that the sysop must shell out significant money for,
     like extra phone lines, Usenet newsgroups, echoes he must make
     long-distances calls to get, etc., and the fee is usually a tiny
     fraction of a typical ISP's.

      PS>  FIDONET    Encourages the use of Pre-Windows computers, or
      PS> "dosboxes."

     More like, Fidonet *allows* the use of *ANY* computer, or even a dumb
     terminal, so long as it has a modem, and is efficient enough that it
     can even be a SLOW modem.  This is a huge contrast to how, ever since
     the Web exploded, it's very difficult to do much on the Internet
     without a GUI, fast CPU and modem, and tons of disk space and RAM.

      PS> node and bbs software, [...] all of which run fine in Dosboxes
      PS> such as 286's and even XT's, with small hard drives, or no hard
      PS> drives, and with memory as low as the basic 640K.

     ...or on a wide variety of NON-DOS boxes, like Macs, Amigas, Atari
     STs, assorted flavors of Unix, etc.!  Standards and compatibility....

      PS>  INTERNET   "No tickee, no launlee" is the motto of the ISP.  The
      PS> Internet is a strictly commercial, no-bones money-making
      PS> proposition.

     As far as today's ISPs are concerned, yes.  However, do realize that
     the roots are quite different.  It was spun off from ARPANET, built by
     the Defense Advanced Projects Research Agency, as a network to supply
     government communications need in times of emergency, being able to
     withstand even a direct nuclear strike on most major nodes.  Until the
     price of computers fell fast enough to let the Great Unwashed afford
     the Internet, it was generally the province of those lucky enough to
     work at a connected company or attend a connected university, with the
     institutions usually doing a lot of defense research.

      PS> one in your town,) consult your local computer outlet or computer
      PS> paper.  For details on hooking up to the internet, consult your
      PS> yellow pages.

     That really says it all.  B-(

                           ==========================
                           NOTICE OF FTSC NOMINATIONS
                           ==========================

     by Adrian Walker, 1:153/752

     Since 1 December 1996, discussion has been underway in the FTSC_PUBLIC
     echo defining the mission and operating procedures for a revitalized
     Fidonet Technical Standards Committee (FTSC).

     These have been formalized in two new documents, FTA-1000 (FTSC
     Charter) and FTA-1001 (FTSC Operations) which have been hatched into
     the FTSC file echo and are also available from:

           File Request - 1:153/752 as FTA-1000.TXT and FTA-1001.TXT
           Internet - http://www.portal.ca/~awalker/ftsc.htm

     With the finalization of these documents, nominations are now being
     accepted for FTSC Standing Members.  The following extract from
     FTA-1001 describes the nomination and voting process:

          FTSC members are appointed for a two year renewable term.  [50 %
          of appointments on initial formation of the FTSC shall be for a 3
          year renewable term, to ensure continuity of the Committee on
          expiry of the terms.]

          To be selected as a FTSC member, an individual must be a Fidonet
          node, and should be actively involved in Fidonet. Examples
          include having put out a Fidonet-related product or having
          updated a product in the preceding two years, or having
          experience as a Coordinator, Echomail Coordinator or mail or file
          Hub.

          Standing members may be nominated Fidonet-wide by all of the
          following methods:

          1.  any RC or REC
          2.  a nominating committee established for the purpose by the
              FTSC
          3.  a nominating committee established for the purpose by the
              ZCC

          A nominating committee may not consist of any current member or
          officer of the FTSC.

          Standing members are appointed on the basis of a vote by all RCs
          and RECs who are nodelisted as holding those positions at the
          time the nominations are published.  A successful candidate must
          receive approval by a majority of votes.

          Publication of the nomination and the voting procedure, and
          posting of RC and REC votes, shall take place openly in the
     FIDONEWS 14-12               Page 15                  24 Mar 1997


          FTSC_PUBLIC echo, and voting shall close three weeks after
          publication of the vote.

          [Majority as defined in FTA-1001:
             more than fifty percent of all votes cast.

                                ===============
                                ACTION REQUIRED
                                ===============

     Since there is no nominating committee at this stage, those persons
     interested in becoming a Standing Member of the FTSC should state
     their interest to any currently-serving RC or REC and request that the
     RC or REC nominate them either by message in the FTSC_PUBLIC echo, or
     by netmail to Bruce Bodger (1:170/400) or Adrian Walker (153/752), who
     are administering the initial committee setup.

     The closing date for such applications to be an active Standing Member
     of the FTSC will be Friday 18 April 1997.  At that time a list of all
     applicants having been properly nominated will be published, and the
     voting process will then be followed as defined above.

     Beware the Ides of March..Hog Wash!!!!
     by Clay Tannacore 1:372/136

        I have just completed reading the article written by a young man
     named Ken Reaverson.  Now, I don't know if this is just one of the
     editor's (Chris Baker) spurious names, but I certainly hope so.
     Because if this isn't, we have yet another case of FidoNet Brain-
     washing, here.  Allow me to elaborate somewhat on this point.  The
     young man says he has been *around* FidoNet for some time, but has
     only recently became a Fido SysOp, sometime around the first of this
     year.  To this point everything appears about right.  However, what
     appears rather strange to me is his everlasting devotedness to an
     association he is only vaguely familiar with.  A short three months as
     a FidoNet SysOp, and he is all ready to sacrifice his first born to
     King Fido.  He has already forgiven those nasty old SysOps who wanted
     him to pay for access to their systems.  Not only that, but this young
     man is ready to join the Pay-For-Access crowd who have bestowed upon
     FidoNet the title as the FREE (for a fee) HOBBYIST (semi-commercial)
     INFORMATION (flame thrower) SERVICE.  He states that "These days, I
     like Fido", well I do to, it's just some of the deceitful folks within
     the Fido family that cause me to toss my cookies.  Another really
     *great* thing this young man finds with the FidoNet community is the
     *information and help* he has received, and is now "able to provide my
     users with access to Internet email or USENET groups".  Fine!  Just
     what FidoNet needs, another access path to the Internet.  Another way
     to draw on the user base of FidoNet.  Another brain fart, thought up
     by people who don't give a damn what happens to this association of
     ours.  Just when the hell are FidoNet SysOps going to start supporting
     FidoNet, again?  I said this before and may as well repeat it here,
     FIDONEWS 14-12               Page 16                  24 Mar 1997


     because no one pays any attention to an old fart like myself, but it
     WAS FidoNet that paved the way for the new nouveau riche we now
     lovingly (?) call The Internet.

        It is not my intention to make an example of this young man (Ken),
     but only to show what has happened in the (Fido) community in the last
     few years.  In plain English, the damn organization has fallen apart.
     We haven't got an IC, and as far as an election goes, you may as well
     be spitting in the wind.  There are just to many self serving dolts
     with their own agendas in positions within the association to hold out
     much hope for a FidoNet rebirth.  To many power insatiate people in
     the organization to ever have a FidoNet that once was an entity with
     pride and purpose.  To many egotistical SOB's who can't stand to see
     the organization get bigger than their own subliminal selves.  Just
     to many blackguards to ever revive FidoNet, at least not to the
     decorated position it once held amongst computer users.

        Let us once again take a close look at this dilapidated piece of
     paper, we so insipidly call a policy document.  This ridiculous clump
     of words with the title of POLICY 4!  Talk about a waste of writing.
     This asinine document that over the years has been the cornerstone of
     FidoNet, in that it is suppose to guide various IC's, ZC's, RC's, and
     NC's in the operation of their positions, and the function intended
     for FidoNet itself.  Needless to say, much is lacking in this useless
     assemblage of gibberish we are suppose to consider a *bible* for the
     organization.  Much is lacking, but one of the basics considerations
     that is missing is intelligence.  I hate to admit to it, but I was
     around when this diseased document was originally written and voted
     upon.  I didn't like it then, and I sure as hell can't stand the idea
     of it, today.  It is time a new (and improved) POLICY document were
     written.  A team of Fido people have to be assembled to formulate a
     coherent policy document.  Whether they are brought together in one
     area as a group, or via the EchoMail process, there has to be action
     taken on this new policy document, if FidoNet is to survive.  A set
     of guidelines, or rules, or even procedures must be written with the
     goal of standardizing and regulating the day to day operation of Fido
     Net, and the thousands of nodes down the line, while there are still
     enough nodes to even bother.

        Okay people!  A new song and dance.  I know you're sick of the
     same old doom and gloom.   Lets touch upon the Regional Coordinator
     position, and what they are doing, and what they should be doing.  On
     a whole the RC's in *most* Nets are doing a fine job considering the
     lack of any real guidelines they have to work with.  Of course I'm
     speaking of that piece of wreckage christened POLICY 4.  Again the
     document with less testosterone than a flaccid Oscar Mayer Wiener.
     The lack of procedural material within that spent instrument never
     ceases to amaze me, and keeps me forever wondering just how any
     Regional Coordinator can administer the nodes they are responsible
     for.  Consequently, we have a number of destructive individuals at
     the Network Coordinator level who whether or not they mean it, are
     contributing to the demise of FidoNet.  The RC's are (and damn sure
     should be) responsible for each NC within their region.  The RC *HAS*
     to involve himself (or herself) in the individual Nets under his
     control, and *NOT* by placing all his apples in one bushel.  The RC
     is going to have to listen to those within that Net, that find his
     FIDONEWS 14-12               Page 17                  24 Mar 1997


     choice of NC disagreeable and inappropriate.  RC's have to understand
     that the SysOp's under the command of his choice of NC, feel anxious
     about making a complaint to him, for fear of retaliation.  The RC's
     (whether or not they agree with this) are going to have to set up a
     system, to allow not only the SysOp's who fall within their
     jurisdiction, but individuals who use (called users, in case you've
     forgotten) the numerous Nets within their regions.  Like it or not,
     these RC's are going to have to become diplomats, and deal with the
     problems that are semi-rampart within FidoNet, today.  Encouragement
     of new users, new systems (SysOp's) and users who do not feel totally
     alienated because of the *I'm better than you* attitudes that many
     SysOp's and Network Coordinators demonstrate towards them.  The new
     or seasoned user who has been in some way *wronged* by a decision or
     judgment of some moderator or NC, has to be able to see a way to
     attain justice (even if no REAL wrong was performed) in what he/she
     perceives as an unjust system.  Here is an example of what could
     happened (and has) happened, when the *GOOD OL' BOY* mentality is put
     in place.  A user said something that the moderator of a certain
     local Echo didn't feel was in the proper spirit of *his* Echo.  The
     Moderator, in an open message to the user, explained his *rules* for
     access to that particular Echo.  The Moderator felt it was absolutely
     beyond the limits (in HIS Echo) for the user to denounce the way that
     messages were being written.  He used the word damn in one of his
     posts, and out of the Echo he went.  The user feeling this was not a
     valid reason to be excommunicated requested of the moderator that he
     be given another chance.  The moderator said "no, and that's final."
     The user wanted to appeal the moderators decision as per the normal
     course of such petitions.  He went to the NC, who informed him that
     if the moderator had banned him from that Echo (or any other) he (the
     NC) would support the moderator.  Now, this scenario sounds familiar
     to many of you, and it also sounds proper.  However, this user was
     extraordinarily upset about his banishment and requested help from
     another SysOp in the Net.  What this SysOp learned was that the user
     had been denied the right of appeal, due to the fact that the
     moderator was *not* a FidoNet SysOp, and thus, the user was denied
     his right to appeal, by the fact the one level of the appeal process
     was not there   You know, the *appeal* process that FidoNet members
     are supposed to have (?).

        Here is a personal exemplification of what happens when the NC of
     a Net, takes a disliking to one of his SysOp's, and allows his
     (supposedly) impartial attitude to become predominating. I have been
     with  FidoNet since 1985 (December 4, to be exact) and in all that
     time my node number has been 1:372/4.  In 1991, due to numerous
     medical (thank you Uncle Ho & Co.) problems, and 992 days in the
     hospital I had to leave the local net, thus giving up my node number.
     When I returned to the (same) local net (and FidoNet) I requested my
     old node number back, as no one had been assigned that number.  Not
     only did I not get that number, but I was enlightened to the fact
     that my request for a *private* node was disapproved.  Of Course, due
     to FidoNet's antipathy for the .Pvt node flag.  I really did
     understand that, but in view of the need for the private flag, and
     what it was requested for, I asked the NC to please reconsider.  He
     didn't, but in all fairness to him, he did pass on my request to the
     Regional Coordinator.  The RC after reading the reasons why the
     private flag was required, nullified the NC's decision, and allowed me
     FIDONEWS 14-12               Page 18                  24 Mar 1997


     a node number (1:372/136) to operate Vet_Net_South.  Anyway, I think
     this action perhaps compiled with other idiosyncrasy has caused a rift
     between the NC and myself, and this is why, when I again requested
     that I be assigned my old node number (1:372/4) if for no other
     reason than old time sakes, I was informed that it would be a
     QUOTE: "make-work" thing and "I'm not inclined to do it." UNQUOTE.
     This type of attitude is not in the best interest of an already
     unhealthy FidoNet, and it is up to the RC's to terminate these kinds
     of practices.  The antecedent is not a criticism of the NC I have
     mentioned, but is being utilized as an example of what sort of
     predilection that has crept into the ranks of FidoNet.  These sort of
     incidences can do nothing for FidoNet, but enhance its demise.
     Furthermore, occurrences similar to the above, do nothing but harm
     to the individuals involved, thus doing nothing for the Net in which
     the misdeeds took place.  I have been around long enough to not allow
     this method of *muscle flexing* to bother me.  However, what of the
     new SysOp in a net?  Will he/she be as constrained as I am?  No, I
     think in all reality not.  Once the new SysOp is faced with a
     situation similar to the above, and is informed by other SysOps in
     that Net, that the Regional Coordinator almost always sides with the
     NC in matters of this kind, he begins to feel the old FidoNet
     alienation, and either sits back and contemplates his/her revenge, or
     simply does the only other thing open to him/her.  He/She drops out
     of the Net, opens up an account on the Internet, and FidoNet pays the
     price by another divestiture of personnel.

        Enough of this, right?  You have reached that point in reading
     where you have decided that a formal complaint for being excessively
     annoying is in order.  Well, hell, go ahead, I need the rest, anyway.
     Just be aware of the fact the Chris Baker (editor of FIDONEWS) asked
     me for another article (as I promised) in public.  What was that a
     great man once said?  Oh, yea, I remember, "Forgive him Father for
     he knows not what he does."  I probably misquoted Him somewhat, but
     what else would you expect from a guy who just pooped in his own mess
     kit, by partially trashing his NC.  Oh hell, what could happen?  No
     node number?  So what!  I can always put my head up my anus blow hot
     air, count some money, and everyone will think I'm Bill Gates.  Apply
     for a new node number under the Gates acclaim, and sit back and laugh.

        Just a footnote for all of you out there who are thinking about a
     way to assassinate me, via NetMail.  My phone number is unpublished,
     my mailbox (snail mail type) has an anti explosive device built in.
     I have no E-Mail address on the Internet (gag), and all my daughters
     are grown up, gone away (with one exception) and impregnable.  My
     dog isn't gay, and the parrot is a wino, and doesn't give a poop what
     you do to him or me.  My wife is meaner than my old First Sergeant,
     and would probably kick your booty before you got to me.  Anyway, the
     Veterans Administration has top priority when it comes to wasting me.

        I have to say this before I leave you fellow SysOps, RC's, NC's.
     If I have offended anyone, in anyway.  If the language I used was
     aberrant to any person.  If what I said was a blow to your self
     esteem, and if after reading all that I wrote, you feel downhearted
     I say this from the bottom of my heart:
                   "I DON'T GIVE A DAMN!"......[smile]

     Review of TransNet - A new Fidonet/Internet gateway
     by Marc S. Ressl, ressl@interactive.com.ar

     Some months ago, while looking for a Fido/Internet gateway for our
     private network DLD from Argentina, I realized that I couldn't find
     any that suited our needs. What I was looking for should only require
     a single POP3 email account, and, by the way, be able to import and
     export echogroups as mailing lists.

     So, after some daydreaming :) I started working, and this is what came
     out: the TransNet gateway.

     The program runs under MS-DOS, and has two main functions: It links
     net and echomail to email and mailing lists, and manages mailing
     lists.

     And, indeed, it uses only ONE POP3 email account. Now you'll ask
     yourself how it resends emails to Fido users? It uses a trick with the
     subject line: email senders specify there a keyword, which can be a
     Fido address, a mailing-list, or any of these special keywords: SYSOP,
     HELP, or MAILMAN (to access the mailing list manager). Real subjects
     go after the keyword.

     This system might look somewhat weird, but after testing it for the
     whole summer it proved to work, and didn't cause big trouble to users.

     There is also template support in TransNet, so you can put some help
     at the beginning of each exported/imported messy. And to make it even
     easier, keywords may be aliased, so people can put in the subject
     "Peter" instead of the cryptic "1:234/567.89".

     The Fidonet part works like most gateways.

     The program also features a security system, so you can ban annoying
     users, or deny access to groups.

     It also resends error receipts from the Internet correctly.

     Regarding connection to the Internet, TransNet comes with two Internet
     mail add-ons, one for MS-DOS, and the other for Windows 95. There is
     also another add-on, for those who prefer things in Spanish.

     Last but not least, TransNet needs a FrontDoor-style mailer, support
     for Binkley/Xenia will be added soon.

     TransNet is shareware, and is freely distributable. For more
     information, visit my program's page at:

     Status of this document:

          This FSC suggests a proposed protocol for the FidoNet(r)
          community, and requests discussion and suggestions for

                The PATH line can be a more accurate source of  information
          than the SEEN-BY  line to determine  if a message  is a
          duplicate.  TosScan with Circular  PATH Protection  (CPP) enabled
          will consider  messages that already have your address in  them
          as duplicates. This works fine in  conferences  that  are
          distributed   within  one  zone,  but in conferences spread
          across zones it can cause problems.

                Unlike SEEN-BY lines,  PATH lines are  not stripped at the
          zone gate,  because  they have  a very  important  purpose: to
          be  able to determine the used echomail topology and
          troubleshooting, like finding the cause of duplicate messages.
          Unfortunately this also means that if a message is entered  at
          1:283/1 and my boss would  be running TosScan with CPP  enabled,
          the  message would  be considered  as a  duplicate, because
          "283/1" is already in the PATH lines.

                If  such  messages are  not deleted  but  stored in  a
          duplicate directory, you will of course notice this happen and
          disable CPP, but you can't know  if messages never reach your
          system because they were deleted for the same reason by another
          node that had CPP enabled.

                 That's why I have the following  proposal. If a message
          travels from one zone to another, the zone gateway should move
     FIDONEWS 14-12               Page 23                  24 Mar 1997


          all information in the current PATH lines to kludge lines with
          the following format:

                ^aZPTH: <origin zone>:<old path info>

                The receiving system in the destination  zone creates a new
          PATH with his address in it.

                There is no need  to support or allow 4D addresses  in the
          ZPTH, since it is only supplements the existing PATH lines.

          Simple sample
          -------------

                A message originating at 1:154/40 arrives at 1:260/340...

          ^aPATH: 154/40 970 9 157/200 265/7 13/13 260/340

                ...and is sent to Europe. This is how I would see it:

          ^aZPTH: 1:154/40 970 9 157/200 265/7 13/13 260/340
          ^aPATH: 310/11 507/1 512/0 280/0 283/1

                Now suppose that  283/1 would gate it  to zone 3, it  would
          look like this when it gets there:

          ^aZPTH: 1:154/40 970 9 157/200 265/7 13/13 260/340
          ^aZPTH: 2:310/11 507/1 512/0 280/0 283/1

                The receiving node  in zone 3 now  creates a new PATH  line
          with his address in it.

          Advantages
          ----------

            1) It enables  Circular PATH  Protection (CPP)  on conferences
               that travel  across  zones  without  the  risk  of messages
               that  are erroneous considered as duplicates and deleted.

            2) A  zone gate can  optionally parse the  ZPTH lines to  see
               if his zone or the destination  zone has already seen the
               message (CZP, Circular ZPATH Protection), which means  a
               duplicate message will never go to another zone. Of course
               this could only be used  if it sure that messages shouldn't
               re-enter a zone.

            3) You  get  a  much better  view  on  the  used echomail
               topology, sometimes it is  very hard to see  where a message
               goes  from one zone to another.

            4) It will not screw up with any  echomail processor as long as
               they ignore unknown kludges. Only nodes gating echomail from
               one zone to another would need to have a processor that
               supports the  ZPTH kludge.

            5) It will hardly increase the size of compressed mail

          Purpose

          To explain and document the existing usage of the ^aFLAGS field
          used by many software packages, including FrontDoor, TosScan, and
          D'Bridge. And to inform software authors of its proper usage.

          Prologue

          One of the problems with the FTS-1 (stored) message format is its
          limitations in regards to message attributes. Several bits are
          used (reserved) by SEAdog, another by several packers and editors
          - even though most mailer authors don't support them, they
          remain. One reason would be backward compatibility with older
          software.

          Unfortunately, this presents a problem for software authors that
          would like to pass extended message attributes for use and
          handling by other software.

          Some software packages have been using an alternate method called
          "FLAGS" which is 7-bit ASCII placed behind <SOH>FLAGS somewhere
          near the beginning of a message. The various flags will now be
          described.

          Flags

          The FLAGS string should be placed somewhere near the beginning of
          the message text, and is preceeded by a <SOH> (^a) character.
          There is no need to support all or any of the below mentioned
     FIDONEWS 14-12               Page 25                  24 Mar 1997


          flags.

          If flags are stripped when a message passes through a system, all
          relevant and correct FTS-1 status bits should be updated to
          indicate the original contents of the FLAGS field.

     Here's another one for submission, Chris.  It (almost) negates the
     previous one.  I don't think it would hurt a bit if they both were to
     run in the same issue.

     Thanks.

     Re: ZEC / RC Election
     St: Local Sent
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     From the ZEC echo:

     Last week I cross posted a message here (and in many other places)
     which I had originally written to the RECs of Zone 1.  The message
     instructed them to:

     "... conduct a survey of their respective Regions to determine if
     they, the Regions, would prefer either another (ZEC) election being
     conducted or an affirmation and acceptance of my willingness to serve
     another term (as ZEC)."

     I asked them to come back to me with one of the following 2
     statements;

     My Region would like an election to be conducted =or= My Region would
     like you to stay on for another term.

     I set the earliest date for replies to Mar. 24 and required that they
     survey their Regions.


     Shortly before I wrote the above message I had been nominated to run
     for the postion of Region Coordinator of Region 19.  I accepted the
     nomination.  Knowing my own schedule committments I felt that I could
     handle both positions without allowing them to interfere with each
     other.  However, there is something that I failed to consider and that
     is that I owe my Region more than just a part time committment as
     their Region Coordinator.

     FIDONEWS 14-12               Page 30                  24 Mar 1997


     I have been a member of Region 19 for about 9 years.  The Region has
     been good to me, supporting me in all of my campaign bids including 2
     terms as their REC, through the past ZEC election, as well as the
     current REC polling process.

     Region 19 is about to lose on of the best Region Coordinators that it
     has ever had, James Ray.  Jamey (:-)) has served 2 outstanding terms
     as R19C but has decided to allow his family to get to know him for a
     while  :-) Had it not been for James' decision to "retire", I would
     never have accepted the nomination for R19C.

     In order to afford my Region the attention it deserves, I have decided
     to cancel what's come to be known as the "vote of confidence" and will
     begin organizing an election for the postion of Zone 1 EchoMail
     Coordinator. I will not be one of the candidates.

     If the Region allows me the honor of serving as its Coordinator I will
     do my best to follow in James Ray's footsteps.  We have worked very
     well together through the years and he has set an excellent example
     for his successor.

         How things would be different if Microsoft Headquarters was in
          Alabama...

           1. Their #1 product would be "Microsoft Winders".
           2. Instead of an hourglass icon you'd get an empty beer bottle.
           3. Occasionally you'd bring up a window that was covered with a
              Hefty bag and some duct tape.
           4. Dialog boxes would give you the choice of "Ahh-right", "Naw",
              or "Git" instead of "Yes", "No", or "Cancel"
           5. Instead of "Ta-Da!", the opening sound would be Dueling
              Banjos
           6. The "Recycle Bin" in Winders '95 would be an outhouse
           7. Whenever you pulled up the Sound Player you'd hear a
              digitized drunk redneck yelling "Freebird!"
           8. Instead of "Start Me Up", the Winders '95 theme song would be
              "Achey-Breaky Heart"
           9. PowerPoint would be named "ParPawnt"
          10. Microsoft's programming tools would be "Vishul Basic" and
              "Vishul C++"
          11. Winders 95 logo would incorporate the Confederate Flag
          12. Instead of "VP", Microsoft big shots would be called "Cuz"
          13. Hardware could be repaired using parts from an old Trans Am
          14. Four words: Daisy Duke Screen Saver
          15. "Well, the first thing you know old Bill's a billionaire...."
          16. Flight Simulator replaced by Tractor-Pull Simulator
          17. Microsoft CEO:  Billy-Bob (a.k.a "Bubba") Gates

     Free Listings in the Encyclopedia of Associations

     People who start new non-profit associations (including othernets,
     lobbying groups and associations having nothing to do with BBSes)
     should get their group listed, free of charge, in the Encyclopedia of
     Associations, so that prospective members, journalists and researchers
     can get in touch with them.

     Groups based in the U.S. should write to the following address and ask
     to be listed:

      Editor
      Encyclopedia of Associations
      Gale Research Inc.
      645 Griswold Street, Suite 835
      Detroit, MI 48226-4094
      Telephone (313) 961-2242
      Fax (313) 961-6815

     Groups based outside the United States should instead get listed in
     International Organizations, a directory published by the same
     company. Its address is:

      Editor
      International Organizations
      Gale Research Inc.
      645 Griswold Street, Suite 835
      Detroit, MI 48226-4094
      U.S.A.
      Telephone +1 313 961-2242
      Fax +1 313 961-6815

     As well, groups based outside the United States may also want to get
     listed in single-country association directories published in their
     own country, such as the Directory of Associations in Canada.  Any
     librarian should be able to tell you how to get in touch with your
     country's national association directory, if one exists.

     Most large libraries have a copy of the Encyclopedia of Associations
     in hard copy or CD-ROM, but it is probably too expensive for someone
     to buy for home use.

     Latest Greatest Software Versions
     by Peter E. Popovich, 1:363/264

     Awk! I didn't realize how far behind I've gotten. Events in my

     this very second.

     Phased out this week: "Amiga" and "Atari ST/TT" Sections.
