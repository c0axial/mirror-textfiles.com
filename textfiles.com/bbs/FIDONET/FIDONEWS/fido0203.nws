                            HOT NEWS


                Yet another week, another large newsletter. More
        general interest articles; maybe we need two newsletters,
        one for sysops one for users? Just an idea ... for now I'll
        leave things alone, no sense making work for myself.

                The newsletter now has a regular naming convention,
        so that you can keep old ones around, or for archiving. The
        name is:

                FIDONEWS.VNN

                Where V is the Volume (1 is 1984, 2 is 1985, etc(
        and NN is the issue Number; 01 is the first week in Jan, 02
        is the second week, etc. HOWEVER, this presents a problem;
        when squeezed, there are name conflicts: both FIDONEWS.202
        and FIDONEWS.212 when squeezed are named FIDONEWS.2Q2;
        anyone have an idea? Im stumped. The problem is that there
        are 52 issues a year, so there are lots of conflicts.

                One really gross way is to make the name strange,
        like:

                FIDONEWS.NVN

                Where the issue Number is split in two halfs, then
        the conflict would be only by year. However, this is so
        obnoxious, it's not very practical.

                Repeated from last week ....

                Bumper stickers are complete; they look pretty good.
        The artwork is a bit crude (the same doggie, about 4 times
        larger than the one on the manual cover) but it's simple and
        to the point. 

                I have 500 stickers; they cost me about $95.00, so
        here's the deal:

                $1.00   three stickers
                $5.00   twenty stickers

                If I run out, it will take me another week or two to
        have more made; I'll inform you here if I do. My address is:

                          Anchor Signalman Mk XII DTR fix
                          -------------------------------

            The Anchor Signalman MK XII does not support the RS-232
        DTR (data terminal ready) signal.  Too bad, since at $250
        (discounted) this is probably the cheapest stand-alone 1200
        bps modem available, and seems to work just fine otherwise. 
        Unfortunately, quite a bit of software (BBSs especially)
        depend on DTR to hang up the phone.

            This file describes a hardware fix which will add DTR to
        the MK XII.  Obviously, this voids your 2-year warranty. 
        However, the same thing COULD be done with an external box.

        ----------------------
            You will need:

               1 - 2N4401 transistor
               1 - 10K ohm 1/4 watt resistor
               a short piece of thin wire (#30 wirewrap wire 
                 suggested) 
               shrink-wrap & tape (to do it right)
               an exacto knife
               solder, soldering iron, and the ability to use it 
        -----------------------

             1) Using a flat-blade screwdriver, open the Signalman 
                case Try not to mangle it too badly.

             2) Remove the circuit board and turn it so that the 
                solder side is facing up, and the serial cable is at 
                the bottom.

             3) It should say "Anchor Automation Inc 00472 Rev A" in
                the upper right-hand corner.  If it doesn't, this 
                may not work, or may not make sense.

             4) In the lower right-hand corner of the board, just to
                the left and above the right-hand phone connector, 
                you will notice two vertical groups of three pads.  
                The left group has no traces coming from it.  The 
                right group has traces coming from the bottom and 
                top pads.

             5) Cut the trace coming from the bottom right-hand pad. 
                Try to do this near to the pad.

             6) Position the 2N4401 transistor with the flat side 
                toward the board, and the wires toward the top of 
                the board.  

             7) Solder the RIGHT-hand wire of the transistor to the
                lower right-hand pad of the group of six that you
                located above.  (The one that you cut the trace to.)

             8) Solder the MIDDLE wire of the transistor to the cut
                trace, on the other side of the cut.
            
             9) Solder one end of the 10K resistor to the remaining
                wire of the transistor.  

            10) Solder a 3" piece of wire to the other end of the
                10K resistor.

            11) Slip a piece of heat-shrink over the resistor, and
                shrink.

            12) Now, find the group of pads coming from the RS-232 
                cable.  Find the 4th pad from the left, and 2'nd
                from the bottom.  There should be traces coming from
                the pads just above and below it.

            13) Solder the other end of the wire to this pad.

            14) Put a piece of tape over the whole shebang, just to
                keep it from moving.

            15) That's it!  The modem should now observe DTR.  If
                the DTR signal is 0 or negative voltage, the 
                telephone line (through the on-board relay) will be 
                disconnected from the modem.  If the DTR signal is 
                above a couple of volts then everything works 
                normally.

            16) Make sure that you connect DTR to your computer and
                that your computer asserts DTR!  The modem will NOT
                operate without DTR asserted!

            17) If DTR is dropped, the line to the modem will be 
                dropped.  The modem should notice it and drop 
                carrier detect to your computer, as well as decide 
                to hang up on it's very own.  At this point, you can 
                bring DTR back up, and the caller (or callee) should 
                be gone. I have no idea what the timing should be - 
                whatever it takes the relay to operate.  1/10 second 
                should be more than ample.  This works with FIDO - I 
                can't tell you what other BBS software will do.
        [ Ed. Note: Fido drops DTR, waits 2 seconds, then raises it
        again. ]

            18) You will soon discover why people with Hayes modems
                are constantly pulling the front off to operate the
                DIP switches.  PC-Talk (and maybe other programs)
                insists on dropping DTR when you exit or change
                communication parameters.  Oh well, you can't have
                everything!
            

            19) Oh yeah - quit gawking and put the thing back 
                together.

            20) Pray.

        In November, Gil Hendrix, a service representive for
        Business Computer Network presented a new modem to the
        Southwest PC Users' Group.  This is a review of that modem
        and the offer that was made.

              A company called Business Computer Network from
        Riverton, Wyoming has just announced that it would like to
        be the first modem manufactuer to bring the cost of modems

        down to earth. They are introducing  the "SmartLink II", an
        external Hayes(tm) compatable smart modem that shifts from
        1200 baud to 300 baud and back automatically.  It features
        auto-answer, auto-dial (rotary and tone), works on any
        computer that has a standard RS232 port and runs on any
        communications software that a Hayes will. This includes
        Xtalk, Perfect Link, PC-Talk III, Minitel, QModem, 1-Ringy
        Dingy and many others.  The modem has a 30-day money-back
        guarantee "FOR ANY REASON" and a 2-year warranty on all
        parts and labor and is available for:

                            ***  $199.95  ***

        The cable for the modem is available as follows:

                               IBM and COMPATIBLES           $9.95
                               DEC                           $9.95
                               Kaypro                        $9.95
                               Apple/MacIntosh              $13.95

                               FREIGHT is                    $5.00
                                              tax where applicable

        This is enough to make most people happy BUT, they don't
        stop! Purchases of 5 to 9 modems are at $189 each and 10 or
        more are $179 each.
                                  AH!  There's more...........

        (1)   You receive a year's subscription to BCN's Network
        Service, free.  This is normally $5 a month or $50 a year. 
        The Network Service offers access to over 15 mainframe
        databases and on-line information services.  Some of these
        services are Dialog, Compuserve, Source, BRS, Western
        Union's Easylink and Commodity Data Information System. 
        Membership is reserved so, you don't have to pay any
        additional sign-up fees or monthly minimum fees. You pay
        only for the actual hook-up time.  Access is toll-free so
        there are no packet-carrier fees to Tymnet, Telenet or
        Uninet. To pay the individual start-up and minimum monthly
        fees for a year to these services would be in excess of
        $3000!

        (2)    You receive the software to access BCN's service,
        free. This software called "SuperScout" is specifically
        designed for quick and easy menu-driven access to all
        services without you having to acquire passwords, I.D.
        numbers, telephone numbers or even sign-on protocals. In
        fact, you can even access point-to-point any other computer
        that has "SuperScout" e.g. office-to-office, home-to-home,
        home-to-office, home-to-school, etc.  Each time you connect
        the service your software is automatically updated at no
        charge.

        (3)   You receive a complete "SuperScout" operator's manual
        and a BCN Database Guide.

        (4)   Finally, you receive a 3-month subscription to Link-Up

        Magazine.

        Anyone not wanting the modem can subscribe to the service
        for $5-month or a once-a-year fee of $50 and receive the
        four items above.  If you pay the fee for a year ($50), BCN
        will give you a 300 baud modem free.

        The service currently communicates at 300 baud but, in order
        to promote the new 1200 modem, service will be upgraded
        before spring.

        You may purchase the modem or the service with your credit-
        card by calling BCN's 24 hour-a-day-every-day-of-the-year
        (includes Christmas Eve, etc.) Customer Service Toll-Free

           I am writing this article in the hopes that I may receive
        some suggestions in regard to a bulletin board system that I
        am currently writing in Turbo Pascal under CP/M-86 for the
        DEC Rainbow. I previously completed a BBS in C, but it badly
        needed a rewriting, and I found some significant advantages
        in Turbo, most notable of which is its portability (Turbo is
        available on many systems other than the DEC). In writing
        this BBS I am borrowing many of my favorite BBSs, including
        Fido. If this goes as planned, my system should include the
        following unique features of Fido

        1. The Net
        2. Linked message replys (-,+)
        3. Type-ahead (not unique, but still nice)

        In addition, I will attempt to add all or most of the

        following:

        1. Auto-file squeezing. This requires some explanation:

                Squeezed files are files specially incoded using a
        strange (Huffman - ??) algorithm. Commonly, they are named
        with a Q in the center of their file extension (e.g.
        FILENAME.EQT instead of FILENAME.EXT). This compression
        saves anywhere from 0 to 60 percent (approx.), usually
        around 40%. Unfortunately, to use these files, you must have
        a special unsqueezing program. Also, when squeezed text
        files are placed on Fido they cannot be read with the (T)ype
        command. Therefore, many Sysops place both the squeezed and
        the unsqueezed version of a file onto their BBS. Although
        this reduces download time for those people with file
        unsqueezers, it eats disk space, and those of us with
        floppy-only systems want to save disk space with file
        squeezing, not lose it. For these reasons, I plan to
        implement the squeezing techniques into all the files of my
        BBS. System files (i.e. WELCOME, NEWUSER, etc.) would be
        squeezed automatically by the system the first time the
        system is run, although for technical reasons, messages and
        USER.BBS cannot be squeezed effectively. Uploads would be
        squeezed if not squeezed already. Files posted by the Sysop
        must be squeezed manually with the squeeze utility before
        being copied onto the files disk. A file is listed in the
        directory with its unsqueezed file name. When a file is
        downloaded, the user is asked "Squeezed (y/n)? ", and the
        file is unsqueezed as it is sent if (n)o is selected. I
        anticipate signifigant savings in disk space and download
        time with this technique. Comments are welcome.

        [Ed. Note: I couldnt resist a comment here ... it is an
        excellent idea; also, I think you can do it all painlessly.
        A squeezed file has Control-V as its first byte I think;
        just check that, then you can do either with no special
        files, etc ]

        2. Rainbow specific screen handling:

                I can't remember who mentioned this in FIDONEWS
        volume 2, number 2, but I think this may be the answer to
        his complaint. After baud rate is detected, my BBS will send
        the VT100 terminal query code to the user, and if the
        appropriate code is returned it would assume full- screen
        menu and editing functions, and accept function keys. This
        will be low on my priority list, because of its complexity
        and Rainbow-specificy, maybe a later version...

        3. Original user-interface:

                Every BBS I have ever logged onto has used
        essentially the same user- interface. It prints either a
        menu or a short list of valid letters (or either, in the
        case of Fido), and then prompts for a letter entry. I have
        seen a couple of variants on this theme, one being the way
        Fido allows multiple commands on a line (e.g. 'gn' instead







fidonews     --           21 Jan 85  23:24:56           Page 9

        of [g]oodbye followed by [n]o). The other, possibly the
        best, was on a Commodore 64 system (stop laughing). It
        printed a menu, in the same format (i.e. G Goodbye, R Read
        messages) at every prompt, but at any point the menu could
        be aborted by entering a valid command. This allows expert
        users to execute commands as fast as they can type them,
        while new users can see the possible commands and execute
        the correct one as soon as they see it on the menu. If my
        other idea doesn't work out, this will be the user-interface
        for my BBS. *My* idea is based on the philosophy that if
        Infocom can do it, so can I. A simple "artificial
        intelligence" (if I dare call it that) routine would allow
        users to enter commands such as 'read message 21' and 'enter
        a message and log off', and then execute them. With a
        healthy number of abbreviations for experts, and ALOT of
        synonyms (e.g. post a message, leave a message and enter
        message must all be understood) this would make using the
        BBS easy even for a total computer novice. I would
        especially like comment on this one.

        4. External program execution:

                This would allow a user to select a program from a
        menu set up by the Sysop and run it while on line. Text
        games, short utilities (like a program that prints the
        calendar for any month of any year) and interpreted
        languages (not Basic, maybe LISP or APL) would all be
        perfect for this sort of thing, as long as there is not way
        to access system files from within the program (disable the
        BASIC LOAD and SAVE commands and make the user up and
        download their program right into BASIC as needed, or set up
        a special directory or user number only for the
        application). This would add endless expandibility to the
        BBS.

        5. Source code availability:

                I would be happy, when finished, to supply anyone
        with the source code for this BBS, allowing them to modify
        it and see how it is done. This will spare other would-be
        communications authors the trouble I had to go to in order
        to find such goodies as pascal source for the squeezing
        algorithm and C source for Kermit and Xmodem (I still don't
        have the code for the Modem7 file name transfers -- if
        anyone could extract this from the Modem7 source and mail it
        to be, I would appreciate it). This would also allow
        conversion to other machines, meaning (brace yourself)
        FIDONET on an *Apple*, FIDONET on a *C64*, FIDONET on a
        *Timex Sinclair* (well, maybe not -- message sending would
        run out of the one hour window -- stick to uding yours as a
        doorstop). Fidonet could also be made into a stand alone
        program so that non-Sysops could send and receive mail (with
        suitable modifications to Fido -- I think that if a phone
        number could be entered in place of a node # in mail sending
        by priveleged users, this would become a much more feasible
        idea). Anyway, my parathesis key is wearing out, and you get
        the idea.

        [Note from TJ: I'm more than willing to help with getting
        FIdoNet running in other non-Fido systems. There is a doc
        file around somewhere, FIDOMAIL.DOC, that explains part of
        the protocol, and I'll even help with some sources where I
        can for serious attempts such as this. Matt, let me know
        when you get to that point ... I would LOVE to see non-Fido
        FidoNet nodes!]

        I have been thinking about how it costs $30.00 per month in
        lost income to have my money tied up in a quality printer,
        and realize that everyone who wants a printer has the same
        problem.  Since FIDO reaches perhaps 10,000 people (112
        nodes, 100 users/node) and they all have modems, and
        computers, and  *awareness*, it seems natural to have a
        cooperative effort to make a better quality printer
        available to everyone, at a much lower cost.  Nobody has. 
        However, I will instigate The Great FIDO Co-op Concept now
        with the specific instance of >Printer Coop<!

        I intend to offer a printer service as follows:
         .
        Printer 1

        A Daisy Wheel letter quality printer with standard business
        fonts.

        Printer 2

        HP Laser Printer, 1/300 inch dot resolution. vertical or
        horizontal page layout (8.5 * 11) Remote user access to
        ascii control codes including bit graphics for Half-tone
        pictures. US Mail, Federal Express of printout. Velo binding
        and mass reproduction at the local Kinko's franchise.
         .
         .           .......................
         .
        The cost will be determined by a survey.  The survey, in a
        separate file, works as follows.  You fill in the maximum
        costs that you would be willing to pay.  Obviously if it
        costs me $1.50 to print and mail something and your detail
        will only remit $0.75, I will not choose to do this. 
        Although you are invited to modify the form to add
        suggestions  that I haven't thought of, it would be easier
        for me if  you keep close to the survey grammer included.  I
        will use an automatic parser to tabulate the results, and
        although free form is ok, it is really nice to keep the
        correct key words. If you have two different needs of
        printing, say volumn, cheap dot matrix, or graphics on a
        specific brand, make out a separate survey for each need. 
        If there really are 10,000 of us, and we all need this, 







fidonews     --           21 Jan 85  23:25:13           Page 11

        then there could be printer installations of several
        descriptions in several parts of the country.  

        I will share the survey results, and I would encourage
        anyone else to set up a  printer coop node in, say, remote
        and sunny California if there is lots of need there.

        The references business is a future thing,  like 0 means
        that anyone can use the system, and if they are abusive it
        gets to be a problem.  If references are required, then the
        group is self-juried, and only known people get in.  So if
        someone is just not your style on your local FIDO, you won't
        endorse his use of the printer service.  Um, if he isn't
        anybody's style, nobody has to deal with him.
         .
         .           .......................
         .
        I'd like to know if there is any interest in having this. 
        It would be significantly cheaper to have a few sites have
        printers, other sites have other  facilities rather than
        each of us go and buy a Laser Printer. Besides, I need to
        justify the cost of my new toy.
         .
           Feedback like "Geez, onl $0.06!, Sometimes it would even
        be worth $0.10 if all I have to do is download and wait. But
        could you give it for $0.04 if I will wait until next week?"
        will be appreciated.

          I've been informed (by Michael Miller, the West Coast
        editor of Popular Computing), that a file called VIRDIR has
        been uploaded to several systems lately. This file purports
        to be a disk utility, but is actually a disk reformatter
        (involuntary). Several people have evidently had their hard
        disks wiped by this program. It appears to be a try at
        "getting to" sysops. Beware of this file!
        UNIQUE: YOUR INDEPENDENT UNIX/C ADVISOR 
        Hot Stuff We've Heard
                A usually reliable source claims to have seen
        figures that indicate 63% of U.S. government RFPs (Request
        for Proposals) issued in 1983 mentioned UNIX, and that this
        has caused a dropoff in IBM's business with  the government. 
        Apparently, IBM hasn't taken a stance behind UNIX that  is
        as strong as the government would like.  This may be one of
        the reasons behind IBM's growing support of UNIX...Speaking
        of IBM, we have word from an internal source that the
        documentation for XENIX on the PC/AT  will be completely
        redone to IBM standards; a hint that they'll be really 
        pushing it heavily this time?...No matter what else happens,
        get a PC/AT if you're a software developer.  We predict it
        will be the most popular  UNIX (er, XENIX) microcomputer
        very quickly. This means that XENIX will  surely be the most
        popular multiuser operating system by units sold, not UNIX
        itself...But other systems for the PC/AT are already
        available, including VENIX and PC/IX.  VENIX runs on the
        iAPX286 processor (with  only about a 45 KB kernel!), while
        PC/IX currently runs on the 8088 in PC  compatibility
        mode...We've heard that IBM is working on a Macintosh-like
        interface for their next computer...Watch for Sperry to
        attempt to enter into the market now being carefully
        nurtured by Gould...Look for a floating point and math
        accelerator chip for the AT&T 3B2 by January, as well  as a
        new machine from AT&T, to be bigger than the 3B5, with 
        multiprocessor architecture.  It will be binary compatible
        with the  3B2/3B5, and is intended to compete in the higher
        ranges.  It is not certain what effect  this will have on
        the current 3B20 series, although the 3B20, as we've
        mentioned, has never been marketed very aggressively and is
        based on older technology. Support will no doubt continue
        for the 3B20 line.

         Typesetting Without Troff 
         SofTest, Inc. 
         555 Goffle Road 
         Ridgewood, NJ 07450 
         (201) 447-3901
               Ever wanted to be able to typeset documents but were
        too busy to  learn troff?  SofTest has recently incorporated
        its LEX word processor into a new software product called
        LEX-SET.  It was designed to take finished documents
        produced using LEX and translate the formatting commands 
        into those which troff uses to generate output for
        typesetters (LEX was  covered in UNIQUE Volume 2 Number 7). 
        LEX, and therefore LEX-SET, has a built-in dictionary and
        mass mailing features.
              In an exclusive early demonstration, we were shown a
        preliminary  release of LEX-SET running on an Altos 186
        hooked up to an HP LaserJetr  typesetter.  LEX was designed
        as a "what you see is what you get" word processor.  The
        format of the completed document is plotted out through  the
        rulers (which denote margins, tab stops and other features)
        that LEX uses.  You can preview your document to a certain
        extent on the screen,  as well as by using the daisywheel
        emulation capability of the HP  LaserJet.  A document is
        printed in one default point size (size of letters) unless
        you put changes in the file for such things as headings and
        subheadings.  Leading (the distance between lines of text)
        can also be controlled by LEX-SET.  The "official" Bell
        Laboratories math character set  has been incorporated.  A
        full screen of characters is the equivalent of 8 inches of
        printed text, which is meant to aid you in visualizing the
        placement of text on paper.  LEX-SET is compatible with eqn,
        tbl, and  pic.  As part of the preliminary version, a
        special code was needed to precede any special lines that
        would be sent to these tools.  This will  be made easier in
        a later, final release.
               This powerful software package was made possible by
        cooperation between SofTest and Textware International (see
        story in this issue).  SofTest wrote a filter that would
        process LEX output into troff  instructions, and this was
        interfaced to tplus in just about two hours,  according to
        Dave Schneider of SofTest.  Working with LEX-SET proved to
        be easy, even with no prior experience in using LEX.  We see
        products such  as LEX-SET making a big difference in office
        automation under UNIX, since  you can either decide to use
        the laser printer as a daisywheel emulator  (fast but plain)
        or as a typesetter (fast but nicer to look at) and this can
        serve a whole office full of people.  While the output
        quality of 300  dot-per-inch printers such as the LaserJet
        is not up to that of a true typesetter, we feel that it's
        more than adequate for letters,  documentation, and almost
        everything except glossy magazines.
               The HP LaserJet currently is available with a 10
        point Times Roman  font with normal, bold and italics (for
        use in regular text), a 8 point  light font (for small
        notes, captions, footnotes) and 14 point Helvetica bold (for
        headlines).  Any other fonts and styles must be drawn in

        graphics mode as "custom" typefaces. As the HP LaserJet has
        only 59K of  graphics memory, there is a limit (6 square
        inches) to how much customized typeface it can print at one
        time. In fact, you can easily run out of  memory after
        printing just a few lines of custom type.  Remember, this is 
        a limit of the printer, not LEX-SET; we've already heard
        rumors about  add-on memory for the printer that will
        overcome this problem.  Another  thing you should be aware
        of is that text printed in 7 to 12 point type  will be in
        Times Roman font, while 14 point bold text magically becomes 
        Helvetica.  Again, HP is due to come out with new font
        cartridges that should substantially widen these choices. 
        The HP LaserJet (based on the Canon personal copier
        technology) prints up to eight pages a minute, holds 100
        sheets of paper, and can even print on manually-fed
        envelopes.
              The software will run on the Radio Shack Model 16, the
        Altos 186 and  586, and the IBM PC/AT (available in
        January), and will cost approximately $2,500.  ACE, the
        originators of LEX, will be the distributor of LEX-SET
        outside the United States.  SofTest is working on a 
        French/Canadian version of the character set to be released
        next year. Pricing is $2,500 to $10,000, depending on
        whether you purchase a  complete hardware/software package
        or just add LEX-SET to your LEX word  processor and the type
        of machine you're using.  One more thing: you can also hook
        LEX-SET up directly to any typesetter supported by tplus. 

         UNIQUE: YOUR INDEPENDENT UNIX/C ADVISOR
         UX-Basic: The Product 
              UX-Basic is clearly targeted at software developers
        (they won't even  sell it to end users).  The full
        development package includes an interpreter, compiler, and
        runtime module, so you can write programs under the
        interpreter and test the compiled version that your customer
        would get.  We're very impressed by their aggressive
        pricing: the full system for  machines such as the Altos
        586, Tandy Model 16, and IBM PC/XT (and probably AT) costs
        just US$500!  The price for typical "supermicros" such as
        the Callan, CRDS, Codata, IBC Ensign, NCR Tower, and Zilog
        Model 11 is US$1000.  Even the development package for the
        largest machines supported  at this writing (AT&T 3B5,
        Masscomp, Plexus P35, Sun, and Zilog 21 & 31) costs no more
        than US$1500.  These are suggested end user LIST prices, not
        OEM discounted.  The runtime module alone, which you would
        presumably  make available with your compiled code, lists
        for between $150 and $450. OEM arrangements will be based on
        royalties of from 5% to 30% of the above prices, depending
        on volume.  There are 22 machine ports now in  progress, and
        we've been told they're doing about one per week. 
              While the very mention of the BASIC language seems to
        put most C  programmers into shock, BASIC remains a popular
        language for applications  programs.  Perhaps small business
        end users feel more comfortable with a language that comes
        with personal computers.  In any case, the description of
        UX-Basic sounds like a BASIC programmer's wildest dream come 
        true: automatic backup of source programs, 32K long strings,







fidonews     --           21 Jan 85  23:25:46           Page 15

        automatic ISAM files, full matrix operations, multi-tasking
        programs (with assignable priority!), record and file
        locking for multiple users, 32 character  statement labels,
        16-dimension arrays, full support of termcap, commands to
        generate a cross-reference or "prettyprint" the program,
        recursive and  multiline subroutines, command expansion and
        syntax checking at source entry time, WHILE/WEND,
        CASE/SELECT/OTHERWISE, and IF/THEN/ELSE  constructs, BCD
        math with 13 digit precision (no roundoff errors!), and even
        a built-in HELP command.
              Intel took it in to evaluate as an in-house product on
        their 286/310  machine (which we've heard is IBM-PC/AT
        object code compatible) and seem to love it.  A well-known
        software outfit is doing internal work with  UX-Basic to
        help define the use of internal tokens: since they use 2
        bytes per token, 65,535 functions can be built into the
        language. 
              Of course, UX-Basic is written in C, and both the
        interpreter and run-time module are fully re-entrant.  The
        ISAM has been implemented using the RDS product C-ISAM, and
        reportedly only added 2% extra code to UX-Basic.  Even so,
        this current 2.0 version is already slated to be dropped
        eventually in favor of their newer product, which they call 
        UX-Basic+.  UX-Basic+ adds the ability to make direct UNIX
        system and C-ISAM calls from BASIC.  

        COMPUTER BOOK REVIEW
         Monday    December 24, 1984
         ** Copy II PC.  Central Point Software (9700 SW 
         Capitol Hwy., Suite 100, Portland, OR 97219).  $39.95 
              Copy II PC belongs beside every IBM PC.  This disk
        copy program lets you backup most of the popular, copy-
        protected, commercial software.  If you're the  normal
        consumer who hates copy-protection schemes, Copy II PC lets
        you fight back.  Naturally, its  producer, Central Point
        Software, warns that Copy II PC is to be used only to create
        archival backups.  U.S. Copyright Law allows one duplication
        of a software program for personal use only. 
              The copying process is completed in two simple  steps: 
        bulk-erasing a blank diskette, and then  reading from the
        target diskette and writing to the  blank diskette. 
        Instructions are also given for hard  disk systems.  Copy II
        PC works cleanly and  effectively.
                Documentation is clear, succinct, and complete. Copy
        II PC is updated regularly to reflect changes in  copy-
        protection schemes.  A list of the commercial software that
        can be backed up is available from Central Point Software. 
        And a pleasant twist, Copy II PC practices what it preaches-
        -it's NOT copy protected!  A jewel that belongs in every IBM
        PC user's bag of tricks.

        ============================================================
         By Franklynn Peterson & Judi K-Turkel 

        ============================================================
              Since the computer industry is six parts show biz and
        one part  technology, our annual tradition has been to
        recognize in print the  best playacting of the year by
        computer makers. This year, as last,  after you read about
        our favorite villains and heroes we'd like to hear about
        yours. 
              Winners of this year's awards will receive our
        companion to the Oscar statue, the Lady Ada, named for the
        first computer programmer. The envelopes please! 

        ============================================================
              Winner for Flashiest Marketing Gimmick of 1984,
        Hewlett-Packard. 
         H-P sent clever toy `laser' guns to thousands of computer
        dealers (and computer publications) along with a message to
        zap the competition with H-P's LaserJet printers. We
        estimate H-P needs to sell a couple hundred printers just to
        cover the cost of the guns, their 59-cent Radio Shack
        batteries, the fancy packaging, and the $2.18 postage.
        People in our office nearly made war to possess this child's
        marvel of flashing lights and noisemakers, and suggest that
        H-P could see faster returns on its investment if it forgets
        new-tech printers and sells  the new-tech toy guns -- or
        turns its talents to keeping the jets  unclogged in its cute
        little Thinkjet inkjet printer. 

        ============================================================
              Winner for Quietest Marketing Gimmick of 1984,
        Personal Software, makers of pfs:products, for mailing out
        handsome mugs emblazoned with  the slogan, `The rebellion is
        coming.' It took five minutes of searching to find the scrap
        of identifying paper that told us who our  benefactor was
        and that the rebellion's leader was their new spreadsheet
        program, pfs:plan.  The pfs:folks, too modest to use capital
        letters in their product names, even market with too much 
        modesty -- which may explain why it's often tough to find 
        lots-for-the-money pfs:programs in stores.

        ============================================================
              Center Ring Performance of the Year, Apple Computers.
        This  company, which got its start in a leaky California
        garage, spent more  millions of dollars than they'll admit
        to us showing prime-time TV ads during 1984, buying all the
        ad space in Time magazine's post-election  special issue, 
        and then -- the biggest spectacular of them all -- hiring
        halls, rock bands, light shows, fancy hotel dining rooms,
        and tuxedos to stage the slickest introduction of any
        product -- its IIc portable -- since P.T. Barnum died.
        Despite its center-ring  spectaculars, the real action was
        out on the midway where the tickets  are sold. Apple dealers
        were slipping out, not in, under the tent  flaps, angry that
        Apple was competing with them by selling computers at near-

        zero profits through college discount centers. If Apple 
        collapses, it'll be Apple's doing, not IBM's. 

        ============================================================
              Best Actor of 1984, IBM. It settled out of court
        almost every one of the kicking-and-screaming nuisance
        lawsuits it started against IBM  compatible makers. Best
        Supporting Actor of all time, the U.S. Justice Department,
        for dropping its antitrust suit against IBM.

        ============================================================
              Best Foreign Star, Radio Shack. Its network of
        outside-the-USA  plants makes it about the largest importer
        of electronic equipment. In 1984 it brought about $200
        million in computers and another $650 million worth of other
        electronic paraphernalia into the USA. 

        ============================================================
              Best Mystery Starlet of 1984, Lisa2. Has anybody seen
        her? Has  anybody bought her? Does Apple still sell her?
        We've been unable to  confirm rumors that she was eaten by
        her own mouse (or that Apple's  renaming its black-and-white
        version `Mono Lisa').

        ============================================================
              Winner for Most Unbelievable Ghost Story, Osborne
        Computer  Company. Even though the company was bankrupt and
        counted among the  dead by computer consumers, it followed
        through with plans to print  stock certificates and sell
        them to the public. If you bought any, they should make
        dandy wallpaper. 

        ============================================================
              Best Comedy, Berke Breathed's `Bloom County' comic
        strip. Computer hackers, who don't miss an episode, believe
        that Breathed draws his funnies on a computer. Breathed says
        that he used to but the keyboard kept wrinkling his paper.
        He tossed away the computer and now has room again to draw
        on his desk. 

        ============================================================
              Best Animal Performance, Diablo, our office cat who's
        trained to  sniff at all our incoming packages.

              Most Improved Performers of 1984, programmers of
        computer games.  They've finally brought this subindustry
        out of the dark ages of clumsy graphics and dull plot lines
        into an era of sophisticated utilization of current computer
        technology. What we need is for these  talents to start
        writing our business software!

         AN INTERACTIVE VIDEO PRODUCT FAMILY 
         FROM VISAGE INC. TIES INTO THE IBM PC 
         A comprehensive family of interactive video products that 
        encompasses systems, upgrade kits, conversion boards, and

        options -- all tied into the IBM PC -- become available from
        Visage Inc., an 18-month old company, whose $1.75 million 
        venture funding came from Venture Founders, First Chicago,
        and two other investment firms. "We offer the broadest
        interactive video product line based on the PC," exclaims 
        Visage President and co-founder Philip V.W. Dodds.
              Dodds positions his product line for use in industrial 
        training, computer-aided-instruction, visual information
        archives, point-of-purchase advertising, and visual expert
        systems applied to equipment maintenance and repair. They 
        address such applications, Dodds explains, by combining 
        motion video, sound, computer-generated graphics, and
        digital  data in a multi-media communications approach.
              Visage's system-level products, the V:Station 2000,
        constituting five models, incorporates color monitors
        offering 256 x 192 resolution and 16 colors or 320 x 200 and
        4 colors;  a PC-compatible computer with video disk
        controller; and V:Exec proprietary software that integrates
        the graphics with the video disk player commands and
        provides I/O device  support. System price: Approx. $12,000. 
              Software tools encompass graphics development, high-
        level systems software, and an "authoring environment."
        V:Paint  development software enables program developers to
        produce still-frame and animated graphics to be displayed
        separately or overlayed on the video images. A V:Draw
        software subset supports menus, titles, drawings and other
        graphics, draws circles, eclipses, lines and freehand
        curves. Contact: Philip  Dodds, President, Visage Inc., 12

             MicroPro released a new version of WordStar last year
        that should prove most useful to programmers and others who
        need a heavy-duty text cruncher - if you can find someone
        who sells it!

             This new version has many features absent from earlier
        versions, including full support of DOS 2.0 pathnames - all
        file operations (edit, print, copy, rename, etc) are global
        across directory paths!  There are no more overlays; it is
        one big EXE file.  You can remove your program disk once it
        starts, and there is no wait for overlays to be shuffled. 
        The sucker runs much faster than version 3.3, has context-
        sensitive function keys, and fully supports most "smart"
        dot-matrix printers.  Plus, the documentation is quite well
        done.

             Only a few gotchas - first of all, it runs only on a
        PCjr!  The patch below should let you run it on a regular
        PC.  Also, there are no MailMerge or spelling corrector, but
        it works great if all you do is edit and print. Lastly, it
        is hard to find!  I've seen a few discount places
        advertising it, and some local dealers stock it.

        To make it run on a PC, use the following commands:

                1) Make a copy of your program disk!

                2) Put it in A:, REN A:WSU.EXE W

                3) DEBUG A:W

                4) E 3CB2 EB            (should have had a 74 there)

                5) W                    (write file back to disk)

                6) Q                    (quit DEBUG)

                7) REN A:W WSU.EXE

                8) Run the install program and enjoy!

                      Introducing:     *** The Modem ***

        A monthly magazine for the IBM PC BBSer.  This magazine
        comes with a diskette holding a massive collection of BBS
        numbers from around the country. With each monthly issue,
        you  recieve a diskette holding even more numbers. This
        comes with a  program that will merge the updates into your
        main list. 

        Some features include:
            * Articles by SYSOPS and users.  
            * A forum for asking and answering BBS related 
              questions.
            * BBS of the month - information about the system, why 
              it was chosen, the phone number and schedule.
            * A column written by a SYSOP that will give advice and 
              ideas or anyone running or wanting to run their own 
              Bulletin Board.
            * Lots of ads for computers, modems, and BBS software.
              If you've got some new software, or equipment, or 
              maybe you want to buy some, then this is the place to 
              look.
