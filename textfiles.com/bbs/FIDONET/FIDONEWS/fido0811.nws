     =================================================================


     You know what it's like. You reach such a level of annoyance at
     certain things that you don't even want to talk about them.  But
     everytime you think about them, you start to get really upset.
     Your blood pressure goes up. You yell at your wife. You get rude
     with your mother.

     For me this week, it's Microsoft C 6.00A, Worldpol and the Z1EC
     election, in no particular order.

     I expect to recover from my problem with the C compiler. Dunno if
     the other two will be as easy.

     I still think the best way to handle whatever it is that Pablo
     has on his mind is to split FidoNet into independent domains. I
     still think that the most foolish way to deal with it is this
     Worldpol thing. It ruins a lot of what made FidoNet useful in a
     failed attempt to fix a few regional problems. I'm glad my name
     isn't on it.

     As for the Z1EC elections -- maybe we are better off without a
     ZEC if this is what we have to go through to get one. In
     retrospect, it appears to me that the echomail got through just
     fine with a bitbucket as a ZEC. Why bother? Vote "NO."

     Yuch. It smells around here. I'll talk to you later.

     Dave Appel, 1:231/30

                    INDIANAPOLIS IS NOW PC-PURSUITABLE

          After years of promises, Telenet's (SprintNet's) PC-Pursuit
     service, also known as PCP, has finally installed outdials in
     Indianapolis.  The official announcement from Telenet is still
     forthcoming, but the outdials are in place.
          Indy's semi-official BBS list comes from the IUPUI BBoard,
     and is maintained by sysop Don Smith.  This file can be
     requested from most of our Fido nodes as file INDY0301.ZIP.
          The latest version contains 96 local boards.  However,
     taking all the multi-line boards into account, we have over 150
     BBS lines!
          Some of the multi-line boards of note are: PBS-BBS (Public
     Brand Software) 856-2087, noted for its shareware; Data Central
     543-2007, files and GIFs; User's Choice 894-1378, GIFs; and L.C.
     Midwest 924-2219, a dating/adult board.  Those are pay boards.
          Indy is also Telelink/Starlink node 9349.  Some people feel
     that Starlink is a better service than PC-Pursuit.
          Assuming that the outdial is in the same exchange as PCP's
     indial, the following exchanges should be accessible according
     to Indiana Bell's white pages.  I include this list for your
     convenience because PCP has not yet published an official XCH
     list. Please excuse any typos or errors.  These exchanges
     include Indianapolis proper, Carmel, Zionsville, Noblesville,
     Speedway, Beech Grove, Greenwood, Plainfield, Brownsburg,
     Fishers, Greenfield, Mooresville, and New Palestine.

                 The so called WorldPol, a Dislaimer

     I would like to make it clear to everyone that the fact that my
     name appears in the "Credits" section of the so called
     "WordlPol" should not be interpreted as support on my part for
     the document, in part or in whole.  I do not support the
     document.

     Fidonet Zones are able under Fidonet POLICY4 to request a policy
     variation by the IC to suit any local conditions which may
     effect the application of any aspect of Fidonet POLICY4.  The IC
     has never received a request from any Zone for variation of
     POLICY4 for any reason.

        Why Tony Instead of Amnon for Zone 1 Echomail Coordinator
     Bob Germer
     1:266/21
     In the current runoff election for Zone  1  Echomail Coordinator,
     we have  two very  experienced,  capable, dedicated  individuals.
     Were  these  the  only  three qualifications for  the job,  there
     would  be  no valid  way to choose between them.  Certainly those
     three traits are critical for the incumbent in the position.

     However,  I think  there  are two more traits  which also must be
     considered carefully  when making  the choice.   These two traits
     are consistancy and maturity.   When these  two traits  are added
     to the balance,  the scales  tip heavily  in  one direction in my
     opinion.

     I have watched  the actions and  positions of Tony  and Amnon for
     the  nearly  five  years  I  have  been  active  in  Fidonet.  My
     opinions  are  based  on my interpretation of their actions as an
     observer  since  I  have  never  interacted  directly with either
     gentleman.

     Consistancy is  important  since  none of us are  fortune tellers
     and we can only make a choice based upon past history. While this
     is far from a perfect guide as our experiences with United States
     Presidents past show, it's all we really have.

     Tony has often taken a  position,  sometimes one in  direct oppo-
     sition to  the thinking of  much of  Fidonet.   So has  Amnon for
     that matter.   However, Tony has never deviated from his position
     even  while  implementing  policies,  practices,  etc.  which his
     duties required despite his own opposition.   Amnon, on the other
     hand, has  changed his  position more than once for reasons known
     only to himself and he has refused to follow Policy.

     Maturity is necessary  since the Z1EC must deal with many differ-
     ent types of  problems and people.   Neither qualifies as a Ralph
     Bunche to be sure,  but Tony  has  exhibited  more  maturity than
     Amnon.   When  Tony disagrees,  he campaigns,  works, etc. to get
     Fidonet to  change  all the  while doing things the accepted way.
     Amnon, on the  other hand,  has done it his way and let the chips
     fall where they may.

     One particular "battle" shows the shortcomings of Amnon vis-a-vis
     Tony in maturity and consistancy.  Let me elaborate.

     Those of us who were members of Fidonet in  1987,  1988,  1989 or
     thereabouts can  remember the refusal of  Amnon to conform to the
     rules of moving echomail, his flat  out challenges to one and all
     to  stop him  from  doing  things his  way, his daring  of the *C
     structure to  excommunicate  him,  his promise to  circumvent any
     controls the net as a whole  imposed. He flamed one and all in at
     least two forums  if they  dared to  suggest that his was way not
     the right way or the only way.

     FidoNews 8-11                Page 5                   18 Mar 1991


     I'm not saying that he was right or wrong in his position,  but I
     am saying that he  didn't work  within Fidonet but attacked it in
     a very vocal and nasty way.  Revolution rather than constitution-
     al change appeared to be his aim.

     Then suddenly, he "saw the light".   Was it a "conversion" or was
     it the  spoiled child  who saw himself  as a clear loser and came
     crawling back?  Only Amnon can say for sure.

     The result  of this change attempt to  move back into the Fidonet
     power structure  was a near  revolt in his region,  calls for his
     recall, challenges to  elections, etc.   Many long-time sysops in
     his region of the US  left Fidonet or joined alternate newtworks.
     Amnon's actions  were in many ways the catalyst for the formation
     of Eggnet.

     So, for this old  grey head,  the choice has to be Tony Davis.  I
     hope the majority of the voters agree with me.

     WorldPol - Is it all it's cracked up to be?

     I've been hearing a lot about WorldPol. About how it's the best
     thing since canned beer. About how wonderfully gee whiz
     democratically-elected and ultimately fantastic it is. It's so
     great, don't even bother to read it, just get your NC to vote
     for it.

     Fight-O-Net politics aside, I decided to have a closer squizz at
     the thing. Well, I didn't have much choice, it got posted into
     ZONE3_SYSOP when the vote was announced. Although I had read it
     before, I figured I'd really give it the once over. I'm glad I
     did. I probably should have offered these comments while it was
     being formulated, but I guess it's better now than not at all.

     First, much of the language used in WorldPol is vague. Too
     vague. Sure, Policy4 is vague too, but if we're going to have a
     replacement why not make it a little easier to understand and
     read?

     Let me give one example: democratic elections by "western
     standards". What the hell is a western standard of democracy?
     Some "western" countries aren't very democratic at all. Of
     those which are loosely labelled "democratic" there's a HUGE
     difference between their respective methodologies for elections.
     And of course there are those of us who might dispute just how
     "democratic" the "West" really is anyway!

     Also, who's to say that this magical panacea called "western
     democracy" is the ideal method of running this network anyway?
     (Well? there's a possibility it might not be!)

     So, the proponents say that each Zone/Region/Net can set it's
     own rules. What about if they directly contradict WorlPol,
     and/or each other? Which takes precedence? Shouldn't it be
     global Policy, not local policy? It just HAS to be MORE
     SPECIFIC about election guidelines before it's useful.

     While I'm carping about elections, I'll also carp about _who_
     gets to vote. WorldPol aims to give the "grunt sysop"
     emancipation. This is a very laudable idea and shuld be
     supported BUT not in the absence of a comprehensive system of
     voter division. Co-ordinating a vote of potentially 6000 people
     plus is a _major_ vote returning effort. There's no attempt to
     enforce electoral sub-division so potentially the Zone
     Co-ordinator Council may have to count all those votes
     themselves.

     Now, onto what I think is the killing blow (for me) for WorlPol.
     The loss of geographic Net division. Up until now, FidoNet has
     divided Nets by geography and by geography alone. This is ideal
     - it keeps PERSONAL and POLITICAL matters OUT of choosing what
     net you belong to. As long as you weren't excessively annoying
     or annoyed and you complied with the few technical standards,
     you were entitled to a node number. But now the cat's out of the
     bag.
     FidoNews 8-11                Page 7                   18 Mar 1991


     You see, POLICY4 already allows you to get echomail from
     ANYWHERE you want. All you _have_ to use your net structure for
     is NETMAIL, nodediffs, Fidonews. That's that.

     Also this method (of net choosing) f**ks with election
     demographics. Say the local region's policy is that each net
     votes and the net co-ordinator is bound to vote for the majority
     view. This gives large, popular, nets an electoral disadvantage.
     There's infinite variations on this scenario. IMHO the loss of
     geographic nets will cause too much damage to the fabric of
     FidoNet.

     So there you have it. A dissenting grunt sysop! The aims of
     WorldPol are commendable but it's implementation is NOT. It's
     just too VAGUE. We could end up with a much WORSE situation
     than the current one. That's why I'm going to ask my NC to vote
     AGAINST WorldPol. What you do is up to you, but whatever you do,
     READ it and think CAREFULLY, please, for all our sakes.

     1:130/20.1102 FidoNet
     20:491/223.0  MailNet

                        A PointOp's View on WorldPol

     One of the problems with the way FidoNet works is its treatment
     of point systems.  Point systems provide a quick, efficient way
     for users to interface with FidoNet instead of fighting through a
     long line of human callers, online time limits, and the lure of
     other areas of the BBS (games, files, etc.).  Occasionally a user
     has to call twice (or more!) to read all the message s/he wants.
     Point systems eliminate this need, thereby serving a useful place
     in FidoNet.

     POLICY4, in my view, has some serious flaws, but I won't point
     most of them out here.  WorldPol fixes many of these problems but
     fails to address my major problem.

     Under POLICY4 point operators have zero rights with regard to the
     operation of FidoNet.  They can not vote, they are not privy to
     sysop-only echomail confrences, they have no say in anything.
     WorldPol is a good document, but in this area it too fails.

     What the authors of WorldPol have failed to note, in my opinion,
     the signifigant contribution to the growth of FidoNet that
     pointops have provided.  I hear of many people writing new
     utilities in response to a technical glitch, to provide some new
     feature to software previously only dreamed about, to contribute
     something new and innovative.  I use some of these products and
     have found them extremely useful.

     The authors of WorldPol have failed to recongnize the signifigant
     amounts of time that pointops spend working on their systems.  I
     have changed mailers not less than three times looking for
     something that will do what I want - I think I've found it.  I
     have spent long nights tweaking my system to get rid of each
     problem as it arises - I know others have, as well.  I'd willing
     to bet that some pointops spend more time working on their
     systems than their bossnodes do.

     The authors of WorldPol have failed to recognize the signifigant
     role that pointops play in some of the message areas of FidoNet.
     They devote large amounts of space to big message areas - I
     receive several very large echos and store them in MSG format.
     They don't have to - they could instead devote the space to
     games, utilities, or other, more profitable persuits.

     The only thing, in my opinion, that pointops don't do that sysops
     do is receive netmail during ZMH - that's it.  For myself, it's
     not so much a lack of desire to become a full member of FidoNet -
     it's a lack of funds.  I won't go into detail - just enough to
     say that I can't afford the hardware required to run a reliable
     system.

     Pointops deserve consideration in FidoNet, even if it's not to
     the point of giving them full node status.  In my view, WorldPol
     needs to be changed to reflect a new attitude and a new role for
     pointops in the changing world of FidoNet.  If I had a vote in
     the matter of WorldPol I would seriously consider voting against
     it for this reason.  I am not saying that WorldPol is not a good
     document, but I think it does have some flaws.  I think they need
     to be seriously considered by those who may vote, and by those
     who influence the voters.  POLICY4 has got to go - but is
     WorldPol its replacement?

     I have serious reservations.

     I can tell that I'm going to get a lot of netmail over this and
     will happily accept it, but I can't gurantee a reply.  If any of
     that mail is a question as to why I put this in the News, well,
     this is about my only good forum - most of the people in
     INTERUSER aren't interested, and I can't access those sysop-only
     echos 'cause pointops have no rights . . . remember?
