                       SEASTAT IS NOT OUR PROGRAM!!!!


     A  program  called SEASTAT is being passed around these days.  It
     consists of a file called SEASTAT.ARC, containing SEASTAT.COM and
     SEASTAT.DOC.  It purports to be a SEAdog log file  analyzer,  and
     bears  a  copyright  notice  in  the  name  of System Enhancement
     Associates.

     This program was NOT written by us, nor was it distributed by us.
     It is an out and out hack that will alter your system in  strange
     ways.  In particular, look for the following:

     Changes to CONFIG.DOG:

     Communet, 631/326

                   H E L L O   F R O M   C O M M U N E T


     Communet ("Communications Network for the Community")  was  setup
     six   months  ago  by  several  non-profit  community  groups  in
     Melbourne Australia,  including the Community  Interest  Computer
     Consultancy, the Working Women's Centre and the Coalition Against
     Poverty and Unemployment.

     As  we are new to FidoNet,  this article is to explain who we are
     and seek contacts with other nodes anywhere in the world that may
     have similar interests.  We are particularly anxious to join  any
     international   Echomail   conferences   discussing   social  and
     political topics likely to be of interest to our members, as well
     as  technical  topics  relevant  to  establishing   our   network
     facilities  or  assisting  community  groups  to  make  the  best
     possible use of computers.


                              TECHNICAL PLANS

     Due to very limited budgets,  we need to establish communications
     facilities  as  cheaply  as possible,  yet with greater technical
     sophistication than typical mainframe systems,  so  they  can  be
     easily  used  by our non-computer literate constituency.  We will
     therefore be generating lots of  technical  questions  about  the
     best  way to do different things.  Hopefully we will also be able
     to contribute some answers when we have gained more experience.

     Our primary aim is to establish a national  computer  network  to
     link  micro-computers currently used simply for wordprocessing by
     various non-profit community groups and other  organisations.  We
     are  working jointly with ASYNC ("Australian Students Information
     Network  Committee"),   which  is  planning  a  similar  service,
     primarily to exchange material between student newspapers.

     When  funding  is  available,  multi-user  AT  or  386 based Unix
     conferencing systems with large fixed disks will  be  established
     in  each  major  city,  linked  by  packet  network  channels for
     continuous parallel updating of all conferences in all cities.  A
     gateway  will  be maintained to FidoNet,  both for general access
     purposes and to transfer messages,  files and Echomail  to  users
     operating "Dutchie" point software.

     The  main  services Communet will offer are Computer Conferencing
     and Email and file exchange for remote  typesetting  and  Desktop
     Publishing  of  text  files uploaded from wordprocessor software.
     But we  are  also  interested  in  chatlines,  multi-player  role
     playing  games  and  just about anything else that will encourage
     non-computer oriented people to get a modem and hook up!

     Initially,  we have established a  single  line  private  FidoNet
     node,  currently  running  Opus  0.0  under  SEAdog  4.00,  as  a
     FidoNews 4-24                Page 3                   29 Jun 1987


     preliminary test system.  This is accessed regularly  by  members
     and  associates  of  Communet  to  become  familiar  with various
     aspects of communications networks and to  provide  some  initial
     services.  As  our  orientation is towards non-computer literates
     and  we  lack  technical  knowledge,  especially  with  Unix  and
     communications  networks,  we  hope  to  learn  a  lot from other
     FidoNet users.  But we also hope to  eventually  contribute  some
     ideas of our own.


                                PHONE NUMBER

     Although we are not yet open to the general public, and therefore
     do  not  want  our  phone  number listed in the nodelist where it
     could encourage calls from numerous BBS users,  we would  welcome
     direct  file  transfers  and  crashmail  from other FidoNet nodes
     around the world.  This can be achieved by simply  including  the
     following line in XLATLIST.CTL or equivalent:

     PHONE 631/326 61-3-482-1718


                              PLANNED SERVICES

     Two Communet services almost operational are:

     1) 'Community  Calendar'  -  a  continuously  updated   list   of
        activities and dates for public meetings and other events.

     2) 'Public  Radio News' - a professionally edited daily news feed
        for Public Broadcast stations around Australia. This will have
        associated with it a discussion  area  for  feedback  on  news
        stories  and  comments  on current events.  We anticipate that
        users  with  a  wide  range   of   different   political   and
        philosophical  outlooks  will find this a useful way to debate
        and exchange views, and that it will spawn separate discussion
        areas on particular topics.

     Other groups that  have  expressed  an  interest  in  setting  up
     conference  topics  and interstate hook-ups include the Community
     Arts Network and Community Youth Support Schemes.  They are  keen
     to  learn how to use Opus boards,  and will be seeking funding to
     obtain the necessary hardware.

     Aims of Communet are:

     1. Establish a network to link computers used by computer  groups
        and their members at minimal cost and maximum performance.

     2. Promote computer conferencing in Australia, by encouraging and
        assisting  the  setting up and running of such conferences and
        by  providing  access   to   international   conferences   and
        databases.

     3. Provide  computer  communications  services  to  the community
        sector comparable to those available  in  corporate  networks,
     FidoNews 4-24                Page 4                   29 Jun 1987


        and  to  promote the the use of computer communication between
        community groups.

     4. Establish an influential position for the community sector  in
        exploiting  computer  conferencing  and  build  this  up  as a
        counter to the press and TV monopolies.

     As Australia's mass media are dominated by a very small group  of
     large  owners,  we see the potential for computer conferencing to
     provide an alternative media that  is  far  more  democratic  and
     interactive  -  allowing users to participate in the media rather
     than merely consuming it.

     We also see computer conferencing as having great  potential  for
     breaking down international barriers.

     At  present these potentials are mainly being used by people with
     a technical interest in computing.  But as the cost  of  hardware
     keeps  falling and the quality of software keeps improving,  more
     and more non-computer oriented people will join in.


                                 THANK YOU

     We would like to thank everyone involved in  FidoNet  and  public
     domain  and  shareware  software development (especially Opus and
     related utilities) for the help and inspiration already received.
     We look forward to meeting lots of new friends in the matrix.

     Peter Green, for Communet 631/326

     Doug Goens Opus 108/44 The Heart of Gold

                               What's To Eat?

     As I was sitting here thinking, I asked myself What I could write
     for the Fido Newsletter.  After several very  short  moments  and
     one crash of my word processor, I will try to bring to you what I
     find rather silly and totally gross to eat!

     I  was  shooting  billards  with several friends when two of them
     began discussing turtle soup.  The first was trying  to  convince
     the  second  that  he would like turtle soup.  The second was not
     about to compromise because he was convinced that he  would  just
     not  care  for  the  taste of turtle.  So the second guy tried to
     convince him that instead of turtle soup that he should then  try
     mock turtle soup,  because it does not have turtle in it.  Having
     never tried either ,(and I am not willing to),  I sort of  stayed
     out of this.  That is until they mentioned that they both totally
     agreed  on  the  flavor  of frog legs.  They both admitted eating
     frog legs on one or more occasion and admitted  liking  them.  At
     this  point I found it necessary to butt in and voice my opinion.
     I simply stated that I did  not  care  to  eat  frog  legs,  case
     closed.  It  was  at  this  point  that I was told that frog legs
     taste just like chicken.  At this I responded that this  was  all
     fine and dandy and that i would stick to chicken upon finding out
     that  I  had  nothing  to  gain  buy tasting frogs legs.  Several
     minutes of arguing had not changed my view and had  also  brought
     out  the fact that I had no intentions of ever eating snake meat,
     as it too tastes like chicken.  I also (by  others  evesdropping)
     found that deer meat tastes just as good as steak, so I will make
     it a point to eat steak,  just for the fact that there is nothing
     gained by me trying something that I know what  it  tastes  like.
     But the entire point of this article is to show my displeasure to
     a  recent  radio  program  that  proudly  told me that the locust
     (cicada) hanging on my tree,  making  that  hideous  sound,  when
     orange  in color would be a tasty treat.  In fact,  he went on to
     say, that when the wings are gone (plucked) and deep fried,  that
     they taste just like french fries!  This was the last straw.  For
     all  of you who are reading this.  Why is it that people must eat
     things that are not commonly eaten when they taste just  like  an
     everyday food?  I will never be tempted to eat any kind of insect
     unless it is an emergency!  I suggest you do the same!

     Thanks  for listening to me whine about bugs for a while!  If you
     have any comments on this feel free to netmail me some.  Oh,  and
     you  are  asking  yourself,  "What  does  this  have  to  do with
     computers? Bulletin Boards? Fido? Opus? Seadog?" Nothing!!!

     Jeff Sheese, THUD BBS, Matrix 110/10

              The Story of the Trash Hauler's Union of Dayton

          The Trash Hauler's Union of Dayton (otherwise known as THUD)
     is a pseudo-elitist group  of  electronic  bulletin  board  users
     dedicated to the free expression of life, liberty, and pursuit of
     just  plain  bull!@#$.  It  is  NOT  a  trade union for the local
     sanitation department.  It is instead a group of people from  all
     walks of life that join together to make life with the computer a
     bit  easier.  If  we can have a bit of fun along the way then why
     not?

          The definition of 'Trash Hauler' comes from a  local  office
     joke  where it is determined that if one wants to look busy,  one
     only needs to dump the contents of the trash bins on  their  desk
     and  carry  a  lot of pencils.  It's easy to justify a messy desk
     since it is well known that an empty desk  (or  an  empty  pocket
     protector)  means  an  empty  mind.  Therefore in searching for a
     meaningless acronym,  the phrase "Trash Hauler's Union of Dayton"
     came to mind (aka - THUD).

          Current  membership  in  the  T.H.U.D.  include  but are not
     limited to:

                            Aviation/Flying, and Astronomy
                            (Skywatchers Echomail conference member)
     Chief PDtrek Killer:   Jeffery Weil, sysop Human Factor (110/88)
                            (no longer operational)

     Chief of Sanity:       Charles Rouhier, sysop EDS Fido (110/20)

          It was first founded  in  August  of  1986  as  a  means  of
     allowing  me  to  use Fido software to dial up my office computer
     and exchange data files between work and home.  This was probably
     done no more than twice a week.  But since there  were  very  few
     Fido systems in the area,  I allowed a few friends and co-workers
     to use the system as a means of exchanging electronic mail.

          But as our needs grew,  so did the system.  The system first
     went  public  around  the  last  week  of  September 1986.  After
     publicizing the telephone number on as many boards in the  Dayton
     area  as possible,  a user base was formed.  Since I *HAD* to use
     the office computer for various things during the day the  system
     was running from 7pm to 7am weekdays and 24 hours weekends.

          The  lust for interconnection to the Fido network grew among
     area sysops.  The only Fidonet node in the area at the  time  was
     the Reynolds and Reynolds system,  operated by Tom Harnish, which
     was attached to the Cincinnati area net 108.  I applied for a net
     number to the network coordinator at 108/10 (at that  time  Allen
     Miller)  and  got  a  node  number  in  the  Net  108 area.  If I
     remember, my first node number was 108/90.

          But after lots of talk and very little action the sysops  of
     the  Dayton area Fido systems pooled together to set up a network
     of their own.  These comprised of:

         Myself, sysop of the THUD BBS (108/90)
         Tom Harnish, sysop of the R&R (108/84)
         Jeffery Weil, sysop of the Human Factor (108/88)

          We had to figure out who was going to be  in  charge  of  it
     all.  With  my  usual luck (while I was napping at my desk) I was
     unanimously given the title of 'Future Network  Coordinator'.  So
     after bumping heads with Allen Miller on getting a node number of
     108/90,  I  applied  to  the  Region  11 Coordinator in Lexington
     Kentucky (Bill Allbritten) for a new network number.  Given  that
     all natives of Kentucky are slightly suspicious of native Ohioans
     (remember  the story of the flashlight?) the sysop of 11/301 went
     to great pains in verifying that we indeed did exist.  Thereafter
     Network 110 in region 11 was born.  We now had the capability  to
     send mail around the world within the Fidonet network.  We didn't
     use it that often, but it was fun.

          We  did have our growing pains.  For instance after starting
     the network our old node numbers from network 108 were carried in
     the nodelist for a few weeks concurrently with  the  new  network
     numbers.  Then  there  were  a  few  additions  to  the  nodelist
     locally.  We originally started out with 3 nodes in the network -
     The R&R  (110/84),  The  Human  Factor  (110/88),  and  the  THUD
     FidoNews 4-24                Page 8                   29 Jun 1987


     (110/10).  This increased to 7 at one time, and now we're down to
     only 5 nodes.

          Also  as  the  new Network 110 Coordinator (gee I love fancy
     titles!) I had to sit down and figure out how to use ROBOT.  This
     wasn't that bad,  except for the fact that I had yet to learn how
     to  specify  file  directory for the Fidomail message area.  This
     was a very important step that I had missed at the  beginning  of
     the entire Fidomail venture.

          Around  January  of  1987  a  local  user  (Karim Ashur) had
     downloaded almost all the  Opus  programs  and  utilities.  After
     uploading  the  whole  shot he asked me to take a look at it.  By
     then I found out how to use the office copy of Multilink  to  run
     Fido  concurrently  with  other  applications.  At  that  time  I
     decided to go online 24 hours a day.  I used the office LAN  file
     server  to  run  the  BBS while other applications served the LAN
     within the office.  It was a nice setup,  and Opus proved to be a
     good addition.

          Since  then  we've picked up and experimented with Echomail.
     We had already set up a Dayton Echomail Conference,  and was more
     than  ready  to  add  the  Vietnam Veteran's Echomail Conference.
     This last addition proved to be a great success since  Dayton  is
     the  home  of  the  Wright  Brothers  and  the site of the Wright
     Patterson  Air  Force  Base,   which  also  houses  the   central
     headquarters  of  the  Air  Force  Logistics Command (AFLC).  The
     latest echomail addition to THUD is the Software Careers Echomail
     Conference (CARDIS).  This was also a  great  addition  since  it
     carries  a  lot  of  good  advice  for  job  hunting  and  resume
     preparation (which is something anybody can use).

          We  are  also  trying  a  new  and  bold  experiment.  We're
     dedicating  each  BBS in the area to carry a certain type of file
     for downloading.  Instead of  everyone  having  the  same  games,
     communication  programs,  utilities,  etc.  - we're setting aside
     different  systems  to  carry  each  of  those.   Currently  THUD
     (110/10) carries only IBM utilities and applications, besides the
     general and Twilite Zone text files.  THUD 2 (110/50) carries all
     the games.  THUD 3 (110/51) carries all of the IBM communications
     and  CPM  programs.  This  helps to cut down on the redundancy of
     files and saves quite a bit of disk  space.  For  instance  if  a
     user  wants to go for the games,  he/she calls THUD 2.  If a user
     wants  to  see  a  list  of  the  latest  available  versions  of
     communications  programs,  the user only need to call THUD 3.  By
     releasing disk space for games and communications I've  saved  at
     least  9  megabytes  on  my  30  meg Seagate.  Others have seen a
     significant savings by releasing  like  files  that  I  generally
     carry for download.  This has allowed me to archive the issues of
     Fidonews published so far this year.

          I  plan on getting back issues in the future for archival as
     well.  I archive monthly sets of four or five issues  per  month,
     and  place  them  in files named like FNMAY87.ARC in Pkarc format
     only.  This saves at least 8 to 10 kilobytes of  disk  space  per
     monthly  set  of  issues.  Fidonews  for  the  current  month  is
     FidoNews 4-24                Page 9                   29 Jun 1987


     available for download as separate files  in  the  Fidomail  File
     Area  until the end of the month.  The current week's Fidonews is
     also available from the Bulletin Menu for  online  reading.  This
     is  acheived  by replacing my WELCOME1.BBS file with an Opus type
     menu driven file display utility that I wrote up  for  displaying
     current   bulletins,   general   information,   weekly   Fidonews
     newsletter, as well as a list of local bulletin board systems.

                            The creation of FUN

     I was thinking of fun things to  do  and  decided  to  officially
     create an un official organization for the elimination of UN_FUN.

     Now this isn't an easy task, first I had to define what the major
     objectives would be.

     First  to  mind  was just eliminate all those things in our lives
     and hobbies that aren't fun.  After giving that  some  thought  I
     realized  that  most  of  us  don't know how to have fun so if we
     eliminated the UN_FUN aspects we would have nothing left.

     So the next idea (and the one I like the most (I don't  work  too
     hard  on any problem)) was to replace the doldrums with something
     fun to do.  What that means is if your  getting  tired  of  doing
     something,  don't just stop doing it but find some way to improve
     it.

     The second major objective would be to eliminate the UN_FUN being
     forced upon us by UN_FUN people,  when someone gets on  our  case
     just  tell  them they are vying for the UN_FUN person of the week
     award.  We will have a vote,  not  tally  the  results  and  tell
     everyone  nominated that they won.  Hopefully they can be brought
     into the societies fold.

     Maybe we will have contests and guest speakers on how to have fun
     once again and award the winners and speakers with  a  resounding
     round of laughter.

     Now  I  know  many  of  you  are going to want to join this elite
     organization so I will tell you what you need to do to  become  a
     FUN person.

     First  of  all  have  a good laugh,  second take the sacred OATH.
     Repeat after me "I am a FUN person and I vow to eliminate  UN_FUN
     where ever I may encounter it." There, now you are a member.

     Lastly comes the matter of money,  we all know how important this
     organization is,  so what I think  would  be  fair  is  that  you
     allocate  $25.00  and take someone out for a FUN time,  maybe the
     kids to a miniature golf course,  or  the  wife  out  to  dinner.
     Remember though that you have to have FUN or it doesn't count.

     Lastly (this time for real),  you can tell people that you belong
     to a non secret organization dedicated to the overthrow of UN_FUN
     in your signature.


     Bill

     President and Chairman of the Board of FUN, an elite organization
     for the elimination of UN_FUN.

     or bring it with you when you come to the conference in August.


     These  ballots  will  be counted by myself since with 200 members
     the charges for a CPA would be very high.  Hard  copies  will  be
     made  available  to  anyone wishing to insure that their vote was
     included.

                               Thank You
