                        Fido National User Directory

        This is an idea that was batted around the last time the 
        local sysops got together.  How about a national directory 
        of Fido users?

        You see, while Fidonet is a great idea, it does have one 
        small problem.  Say I have a few friends in California who 
        might be using a Fido out there somewhere.  How do I find 
        out which Fido they're on?  (In fact, one of the New Jersey 
        sysops once sent mail to a board, asking about people he 
        used to know there. He got a reply from the sysop, who 
        turned out to be a friend of his!)

        Now, I could call them on the phone and ask, or I could 
        write them a letter, or something like that, but surely we 
        can do better.

        The idea we came up with is a national user directory.  Sort 
        of a phone book for Fidonet mail.  The basic idea is that 
        someone write a program that abstracts data from a USER.BBS 
        file (leaving out passwords and such), creating a small 
        ASCII file which could be integrated into a master directory

        at some central point and then distributed.  This would all 
        be voluntary, of course.  

        The update cycle for something like this could be very long.  
        The phone company updates their books once a year.  I don't 
        think we should go quite that far, but once a week is 
        definetly more often than we need.  Say, once a month, 
        perhaps.

        Of course, there are some details that need to be worked 
        out.  For example, there's no point in listing users who 
        cannot send mail.  Also, a great many people use more than 
        one board.  Should we list all the boards they call?  Or 
        should we just list the board that they call the most?  We 
        also have to tie in the list of sysops, somehow.  But all of 
        this is just a matter of programming detail.  

        The important point is whether or not most (or at least 
        many) sysops would be willing to contribute to such a 
        project.  If you're interested and willing to participate, 
        or just want to make comments and/or ask questions, please 
        contact Dave Horowitz at Fido 317.

                                  Fido 10i

        As you probably know by now, Fido 10i is now here.  If you 
        haven't got it, by all means go and get it.  I've heard a 
        few complaints about 10i, but nothing serious.  Fidonet 
        needs and must have multiple network capability if it is to 
        survive much longer, which means we need and must have Fido 
        10i, warts and all.

        Network growth looks to be explosive.  Node number 500 has 
        already been assigned, and I know of several Fidos in this 
        area alone that are champing at the bit waiting for node 
        numbers.  If Fidonet is to remain humanly possible, then it 
        MUST be decentralized.  

        June 12th is the deadline for the switchover.  Everyone is 
        to maintain there present node number in net one until that 
        date.  At national mail hour on the 12th, everyone is 
        supposed to switch over to their new net number, and node 
        number assignment switches over to the hosts and the 
        regional administrators.  With luck, all will go smoothly.  

        Frankly, that much luck doesn't exist in the universe.  I 
        think we're going to have total chaos for a couple of weeks.  
        But then a stronger, more coherent Fidonet should emerge.  
        Personally, I can hardly wait.  The new scheme should be 
        MUCH easier to use, since nodes will be grouped into 
        something approaching a rational organization.

        ============================================================
        Chris Rowley
        Sysop, Fido 359 
         
        The latest PC Magazine talked of our beloved communication 
        medium, the bulletin board.  I personally took great offense 
        to this article, and the words IBM user were the first to 
        spring to mind after the opening paragraph.  I'm afraid that 
        more and more users are beginning to sway to this viewpoint 
        because of reading articles like this.  I hope it will stop.  

        The article nearly said outright (if it didn't) that the 
        best bbs's are the ones with lots of files and places where 
        you could talk seriously about technical problems.  This is 
        major b.s. in my book.  The bulletin board should be another 
        medium of communication like the letter and the phone to 
        meet people and express viewpoints.  If questions come into 
        play, answer them.  But that shouldn't be your primary 
        concern.  Neither should be files.  

        A bbs is a great way to meet people, even if you don't know 
        who they really are.  It is also a place to show that 
        computers don't have to be dehumanizing, that they can 
        promote human relations.  Plus this human factor can warm 
        anti-computer people up sometimes.  

        IBM bbs's are always the least interesting.  Everyone is so 
        preoccupied with files that the use of the public forum a 
        board offers is lost.  The lowly Trash-80 generally runs the 
        best boards with the most bright, interesting people 

        I sit here and watch user after user log on and soon as they 
        see 'Main:' type the lowly 'F'.  You want files?  Try a 
        HOSTCOMM.  They are built for files, not messages.  

        I find boards interesting where there are conflicts, 
        agreements, discussions, debates, the bright, the not-so-
        bright, the random, the straight.  Variety.  The next time 
        you log onto a board, check the messages.  You may be 
        surprised at what you're missing, or the Sysop is missing.  
         
                                   Chris Rowley

                          MORE ON 2400 BAUD MODEMS

                This is a followup to the other article on 2400 baud 
        modems. Since then, I've had more experience with the Hayes 
        2400, and got one of the U.S. Robotics Courier 2400's.  

                Simply put, the Hayes 2400 is a piece of junk, sorry 
        to say. It is nowhere near the quality and functionality of 
        the old 1200 baud model. It is riddled with bugs, many of 
        which are "features" which probably won't change. It will be 
        OK for BBS use, since it insists on entering AutoAnswer mode 
        at strange times, but is unreliable connecting at 1200, and 
        600 is useless.  

                If you insist on buying the Hayes because of their 
        reputation, you are making a serious mistake. Don't do it.  

                The Courier, however, is everything the Hayes should 
        have been. It is just about "perfect", that is, it seems to 
        do everything it says it does, and simply and reliably. Some 
        things you won't see are dynamic line equalization that will 
        improve the quality of connects. It is thoroughly Hayes 1200 
        compatible, and is also compatible with the 2400 Hayes 
        command set. (It does not have all the & commands, thank 
        goodness, but they aren't needed at all.) 

                I spent a week playing with the Hayes, and never got 
        it to do exactly what I wanted. I read the manual cover to 
        cover, experimented, all the usual things.  

                I took the Courier out of the box, set the switches 
        (clearly marked on the bottom of the modem) plugged it in, 
        and it ran first time. Elapsed time: 5 minutes.  

                To get the Hayes 2400 to autoanswer at 2400 requires 
        some work. You have to issue a complex series of commands AT 
        2400 BAUD, then save the settings in the non volatile RAM.  
        Only then will it answer at 2400. I won't go into all the 
        details about the nasty side affects of raising and lowering 
        DTR. Fido, starting in version 10I, has a special modem type 
        (11/J) for the Hayes 2400; you must use it if you want to 
        operate at 2400 baud.  

                The Courier will autoanswer at 300, 1200, or 2400 
        baud with no difficulty. Just plug it in. No special setup 
        for Fido is neccessary to operate it at 2400.  

                U. S. Robotics is offering 1/2 off on the Courier 
        2400 to Fido sysops; this is $350.00 for a very good modem.  
        They will even ship COD. You have to be in the node list to 
        get this deal. Don't pass it up if you are in the market for 
        a modem.

        From: Tim Meyers Sysop Fido #365 & #411.

        Recently I just purchased an IBM AT,  after  a  few  days  I 
        realized  I  was running out of space in my so called "Quick 
        System".  Later I talked with another owner and he said that 
        he  had the same problem.  If only he could find out the way 
        that IBM was putting 1 meg on the mother board  of  the  AT.  
        Impossible feat,  right?  WRONG!  I called IBM,  they failed 
        to comment on it,  so the next day I sent a nice letter thru 
        the  customer support systems at work,  within a few hours I 
        had a reply, It said, and I quote: 

            To: Tim Meyers. 
            From: Ibm Corp.
            Subject: At Exp.

            Sir:

            Yes, the exspansion is known to us here at Boca.  We are 
            unable  to  comment  or provide any information on where 
            and how to install the memory.  We  haven't  tested  the 
            full  use of the product,  but it will be further tested 
            in the future.  We suggest that you install extra boards 
            as needed. " 

        Well so there it is,  they know about it,  but they wish not 
        to say anything about it,  well that's IBM for you,  So, the 
        question boils down to.  DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW TO PUT 1MEG ON 
        THE SYSTEM BOARD OF THE IBM AT??  

        Anyone that has information to  this,  Please!  Send  it  to 
        Fido #442. I Know it can be done, the problem is HOW?

                            ROGUE Piracy Warning

        The game program ROGUE.EXE has been making the rounds 
        lately.  A great many people have been down- and up-loading 
        it for the simple reason that it is a dynamite adventure 
        game.  

                         THIS IS STOLEN SOFTWARE!!!

        The program is property of AI Design of Mountain View, 
        California, and is well worth the $40 which they are asking 
        for it.  These folks deserve their money for such an 
        excellent piece of work, so please make sure it isn't on 
        your board.

        There is also a shareware product called HACK, which is a 
        sort of upgraded ROGUE that runs on any MS-DOS system.  It 
        is quite a lot larger than ROGUE, and a little rougher 
        around the edges (no color, for example), but it is LEGAL to 
        have available on your board, which ROGUE is NOT!
