Editorial: Can I borrow your feet?

by Tom Jennings (1:1/1)

... mine are busy filling my mouth. Hey, what else is new?

Actually I'm surprised I got so little criticism for last week's
editorial. As I wrote it, I kinda realized it was probably not a great
thing. One of out FidoNews' regulars tried to play Simon-says regarding
the approriateness of it in light of the recent ARTSPEC changes; I
suggested he re-read them. But I also teed of a friend, which is a drag
(and will get a personal response).

Maybe I should have used the TV network broadcasters instead; besides
being communications (hah!) oriented, they're slightly less far down a
similar path, only their problem is resisting new technologies cuz they
don't make sense for short-term profitability (and it's a field I do
actually some specific non-mainstream-media info on).

But bashing is too easy, and that's the main problem with last week's
editorial, correct or not. So as I criticized our collective tendency
to complain, I did the same. Consistency? Nahhh....

I'll shut up now.

by Donald Tees
Ex-Libris BBS, Windrush Farm, 1:221/192 (Ontario, Canada)

Whimsy from the Farm

    Outside, there are 90 kilometer per hour winds. We have had
15 centimeters of snow in the last few hours, and another 15 are
expected. Roads are closed, schools are closed. We are isolated
except for the phone and the BBS. A good day to catch up on
reading Fidonews, re-indexing and purging files, and writing to
Fidonews.

    I have been meaning to do this for some time.  I read
Fidonews quite regularly, and it has always struck me that it is
a just a tad serious. I BBS for fun, as do most. But poor Tom
is the only one I seem to read anything personal about. Perhaps
this can start a trend, and we can learn a bit about just how
far flung and different this network of ours is. Who, where
why, what. Some background.

    Who? I am a programmer by trade, age 45, and have been
programming for all my adult life.  The last 17 years as a
freelancer, before that as a company man. I have programmed in
several dozen languages, and like assembler of various sorts
best. But I am not proud, and will work in whatever the job
requires.

    Where?  Out of a farm about 120 kilometers west of Toronto,
Canada. My customers range over a semi-circle about 600 miles
in diameter. Most work comes in over the BBS, and goes out the
same way. The Fido access is for fun, but the BBS pays its'
way. Public access is free; customers pay for my time.

    What?  Weird stuff.  My last job was a computer 7000 feet
underground that weighed trains as they rolled by,  then
transmitted the data to the surface via a fibre link. Maybe I
can lay claim to the lowest BBS call in history; I called my BBS
from down there to pick up some code I forgot.

    What is life like around here? Well, today is not typical.
Today at seven in the morning I put on a snowmobile suit,
flightboots, a balaclava, heavy mitts, and headed for the barn.
I could not see it; it is two hundred and fifty feet from the
house. Ninety kilometer winds plus snow plus temperatures in the
teens are probably something the California readers are not used
to. (Hell, neithor are we.) The barn door had blown open; I had
to thaw the water pipe with a heat gun.

FidoNews 9-03                  Page 3                      20 Jan 1992


    I fed the horses (five of them), the cats (three in the
barn), and the dog (a 120 pound newfoundland puppy). I managed
to shovel enough snow out of the way to get the barn door
closed, and braced it against the wind. Then went out the back
way, and got back to the house. I had put the coffee on before
going out; I poured myself a cup, stripped off two layers of
clothing (leaving one), and sat down to answer my E-mail.  I
have a small network of six PC's and four phone lines, so we are
not really isolated. But it sure feels like it.

    Outside I can hear the wind whistle trough the pine trees,
and my front lawn looks like a surrealistic sculpture. Portions
are bare, and other are close to five feet deep. The wind has
carved drifts into wonderfull shapes. By counting the fence
poles of the nearest paddock, I estimate the visability at about
two hundred feet.  The road is buried. It is going to take a
couple hours with the front end loader to dig out the lane
to-morrow.

    Although Net 221 covers an area of about 75 miles by 40
miles, it is largely urban. I have one of the two or three
rural BBS's in the net, and often engage in friendly banter and
snickering with the urban types. They seem to find it odd that
we knew our Christmass goose by name. We find it odd that they
put curtains over their windows.  The local echos are good
conversation, and quite active.

    So, that is a bit about life here. Whether Tom sees fit to
include random ramblings in the newsletter, time will tell.  If
you are ever up in the Toronto area, drop in. The coffee is
always on.  Don.

The Abuse of Nodelist flags

Before I begin, let me run a quick intro on myself. As can be seen
above, my name is Peter Tan. I have been in FidoNet since 1988 or so (I
can't really remember). Not exactly a veteran, but I've seen a lot of
action.

Why am I writing this? Because I am irritated. Ever seen the current
nodelist? It weighs in at slightly over 1MB, full-sized. There are some
of us who *NEEDS* to keep the full-sized nodelists on our system, and
there are some who need just the local-area extract of the nodelist.

I am writing from the viewpoint as one of the "us" that needs to keep
the full-sized nodelist on the system.

FidoNews 9-03                  Page 4                      20 Jan 1992


Now, as one of the "us" that needs to keep the nodelist, full-sized, on
the system, it gets a bit irritating to see the nodelist flags being
abused. Sad to say, the bulk of this comes from within Zone 6.

If you go hunting in the nodelist, you will see such examples:

,1,My_BBS_Name,MYLOCATION,Sysop_Name,1-234-567890,9600,CM,XX,XA,MO, -
MNP,HST,V32,V32b,V42,V42b,V22,V23

(The above is not based on any single node. It is an example, and it is
to be taken as such. You can see a lot of this type of "overkill" of
nodelist flags, especially within the Zone 6 segment of the nodelist.)

What I feel is that a lot of the flags listed in this fictitious node
are UNNECESSARY. For example, once you're listed as "V32b", V32 is
implied, since if you can't handshake at V32, how can you then do so at
V32bis? Besides, the fallback from a V32bis connect is a V32 connect
(correct me if I'm wrong please).

The table above lists the File-Request flags as found in NODELIST.017.
In the fictitious node given above, it has "XX,XA" marked. According to
the table, the "XX" is redundant. "XA" will more than suffice in this
respect.

The whole point of writing this becomes a bit clearer now. It becomes
apparent that if all these redundant info were to be removed from the
nodelist, it could conceivably allow the nodelist to shrink in size, and
yet hold practically the same amount of information as it did before!

If all the relevant parts of the *C structure would just take the time
out to remove such excess info from the nodelist, merging of NODEDIFFs
and NODELISTs could be done faster, compiling the nodelist will take
less time, *AND* the nodelist would take a smaller amount of space on
our disks. I am thus appealing to all who are part of the *C structure,
to help wipe out redundancy.

A Look At The BIOMED Echo
By Ray Brown, CBET, Moderator
SysOp, USS Triumph BBS, 1:135/70


      Greetings and salutations. My name is Ray Brown. In mundane
life, I am employed at a hospital in Miami, Florida, where I am a
Biomedical Equipment Technician. Usually, a BMET has at least an
Associate's Degree from an accredited college; some even have 4-year
degrees as Clinical Engineers. A BMET in a hospital situation may work
on almost any medical device that has direct contact with patients.
This includes, but is not limited to, things such as patient beds, EKG
monitors and telemetry, defibrillators, respiratory equipment, IV
pumps, electronic blood-pressure measuring devices, and even testing
the electrical receptacles in a patient's room, so as to certify that
everything is electrically safe and will not harm the patient. Also,
BMET's work in various other areas, such as on dialysis machines,
physical therapy machines, EEG machines, and Operating Room tables,
lights, and electro-surgical generators ("Bovies"). And, some BMET's
work solely on X-Ray, CAT-Scan, and MRI equipment, and others
yet work only on laboratory equipment, such as blood and urine
analyzers.

      A BMET may elect to be Certified in one of three fields:
General CBET, Laboratory CBET, and X-Ray CBET. This requires a
minimum of two years' experience, along with taking and passing a
rather hard test, administered by the International Certification
Commission (a branch of the Association for the Advancement of Medical
Instrumentation). Once passed, a BMET becomes a Certified Biomedical
Equipment Technician, or CBET, which is a legal title, such as M.D. or
R.N. A CBET or BMET is a recognized and valuable member of a
hospital's medical support staff.

      I also SysOp a FidoNet BBS, the USS Triumph BBS, which is an
enjoyable hobby. I obtain a variety of echos for both myself and my
readers. About 1 1/2 years ago, I learned of a small, privately-
distributed echo called BIOMED, which was for people like me
to chat and discuss problems and situations unique to our field. I
joined the echo, and had some discussions with a few BMET's. I then
learned that the Moderator of BIOMED was not interested in supporting
the echo any longer, so I asked if I could take it over. No objection
was raised, and I pursued it. I made sure that the echo was properly
placed in Mike Fuch's EchoList (ELIST), noting that it was still
privately distributed, and to contact me for feeds. Within 3 months,
the echo had grown to over 10 systems in 3 FidoNet Regions. I then
asked each SysOp of the systems to make a formal request to their REC
to get the BIOMED echo "BackBoned". This was successfully done, and
around September of 1991, BIOMED became a BackBone echo.
FidoNews 9-03                  Page 6                      20 Jan 1992


      However, since that time, participating systems have slackened
off, and callers have slowed their posted. I realized that advertising
solely in the ELIST was not enough. I then "re-discovered" the
FidoNews, and so I wish to ask all that see this humble article, if
they know of someone that is a BMET /CBET, to please request through
your NEC or REC for the BIOMED echo. Otherwise, it may die a long and
lingering death...

      Also, if there is any interest in BIOMED from non-Zone 1 folks,
specifically OZ (Australia) or the U.K., please let me know, and I'll
work on getting the echo to you.

      In closing, if anyone has any questions about the echo, please
either consult the ELIST, or netmail Ray Brown @ 1:135/70. The USS
Triumph BBS has a USR HST 14,400 modem, and is running FidoBBS v.12U
"barefoot". Thank you!

                                                      _Ray_

                      A_THEIST Echo Available


A_theism means free of religion in the way a_political means
free of politics or a_sexual means free of sex
characteristics or drives.

With that in mind and ever cognizant of the continued
pressure of religion to intrude itself into our government
and its operations, the A_THEIST Echo is provided to inform
and alarm and hopefully wake up the sleeping and too long
silent majority to the peril on our doorstep.

It is now a Zone 1 Backbone Echo Hosted and Moderated
by Rights On! [1:374/14] and Christopher Baker [card
carrying member of American Atheists, Inc.]. Initial links
may be obtained from your local Backbone source connection.
Zone 3 is being fed through 3:681/857 and Zone 2 through
2:243/11 via a Gate at 1:374/14 until direct links can be
made to those Zones via the international Backbone links.

The Echo is open to anyone who can discuss, without
proselytizing, the extreme desirability of maintaining the
absolute separation of State and church in this country as
provided for in our Constitution.

FidoNews 9-03                  Page 7                      20 Jan 1992


A sample of the first few messages and the statement of
purpose of the Echo is available as A_THEIST.ZIP from this
system anytime except 0100-0130 ET and Zone 1 ZMH [USR HST
ds online] if you wish to get an idea of whether to commit
disk space to the Echo. An archive of the past traffic from
the Echo is also available as A_ECHO1.ZIP, A_ECHO2.ZIP, and
A_ECHO3.ZIP, A_ECHO4.ZIP, etc.

Backbone status has been approved. Ask your Backbone
connection to get it for you! The complete info is available
in the current ELISTnnn.XXX file available from your NEC or
REC or here. [Request ELIST.]

I hope you will join us or ask your Sysop to request a link
via their regular Backbone connections!

TTFN.

                     FLA_COOKS Echo

We are starting a Florida-wide Echo [FLA_COOKS] that deals
with cooking and eating throughout the state. Use of native
ingredients and regional specialties will be included as
well as restaurant reviews and anything else that pertains
to food in Florida.

FLA_COOKS is Hubbed and Moderated by Christopher Baker at
1:374/14 in Titusville_FL and by Ronnie Toth at 1:135/71 in
Hialeah_FL [which is a PC Pursuitable town {part of Greater
Miami}]. Contact either for a link into this new conference.

This Echo is restricted to Florida systems. When we get
enough participation, we'll get it on the Region 18
backbone for more cost-effective routing.

There is still an opening for a North Florida Hub and
Moderator. Contact Christopher Baker via Netmail at
1:374/14.

FidoNews 9-03                  Page 8                      20 Jan 1992


That's the general idea. [grin]

The Echo tag is FLA_COOKS. In addition, Florida systems
should have their Florida city in their origin line so
everyone knows what part of Florida you are talking about
and if you mention a specific place or area, you should
define it as if people outside your immediate area are
reading it [as they will be]. This ain't a 'local' Echo
anymore! [grin]

                    MENSANS_ONLY Echo

MENSANS_ONLY is open to any verified member, past or
present, of any Mensa organization.

MENSANS_ONLY is not connected with American Mensa, Ltd.
[The High IQ Society], or any other Mensa organization
anywhere. MENSANS_ONLY has no opinions. Any opinions
expressed are those of the writer and any replier.
MENSANS_ONLY exists solely to provide a convenient forum
for electronic conversation between accepted members of any
Mensa organization. Any other inference you may glean from
perusing this Echo is all in your head, which is where it
should stay.

It is Hosted and Moderated from Rights On! in
Titusville_FL_USA at 1:374/14. It is intentionally withheld
from the FidoNet Backbone distribution system and is
offered for point-to-point links only. Any Backbone system
discovering this Echo traversing their system should
immediately remove it and notify anyone sending or
receiving it through them to desist unless said Backbone
system is an active and verified participant of
MENSANS_ONLY.

Anyone may read the traffic in this Echo but only verified
members may post in this Echo. Non-members interested in
more information about Mensa are directed to the general
Mensa Echo of the same name [MENSA] available from the
FidoNet Backbone and Moderated by Dave Aronson of
1:109/120.

FidoNews 9-03                  Page 9                      20 Jan 1992


Sysops who link into MENSANS_ONLY agree to abide by the
access restrictions above. The content of that Echo is not
restricted to any single topic or idea.

The number of systems linked to this Echo and the volume of
traffic in this Echo varies. Traffic is generally light
which is typical of non-Backbone, special interest Echos.

Anyone interested in linking into MENSANS_ONLY, should send
Netmail to: Christopher Baker at 1:374/14 {Rights On!,
Titusville_FL_USA}.

The following is a list of primary links for M_O:

[Zone 1:] 109/120 114/15 114/74 135/71 250/416 374/14 374/98
380/7.

The Sysops of the above systems may link others into
MENSANS_ONLY based on the acceptance of the restrictions,
imposed above, by the link requesting Sysop.

Anyone requiring a direct feed or further information
should send Netmail to me at 1:374/14. Rights On! is a 24
hour system currently at 9600+ bps. It is now at 9600+ on a
USR Courier HST dual standard courtesy of their Sysop
Purchase Plan.

                    SKEPTIC Echo rising from the ashes?

Since Fredric Rice's system disappeared from the Nodelist,
some of the previous participants of his SKEPTIC Echo have
been trying to reconstruct the links that were in place
from his system at 1:102/901 when it folded.

Anyone who was previously linked in Zone 1, should contact
Christopher Baker at 1:374/14 for a new link. Those
previously connected in Zone 3 should contact Jackson Harding
at 3:681/857. Jackson was a coModerator when the links went
down and has assumed the Moderatorship for the resurrection.

FidoNews 9-03                  Page 10                     20 Jan 1992


The SKEPTIC Echo is still listed in ELIST but the links
noted are no longer valid except as noted here. This will
be updated in the next version.

If any part of the country is still running this Echo,
please let us know. Searching for remnants of the Echo via
Netmail and other Echos has produced very little information
on the status elsewhere.

The SKEPTIC Echo is for the examination of all claims of
supernatural occurence or activity with a critical eye
toward verification and proof.

It is not on the Backbone in Zone 1 at this time but may be
on the Zone 3 Backbone by the time you read this. The link
to Zone 3 is gated through 1:374/14 three times a week.

Come and join us if you are new to the Echo or come and find
us if you are wondering where your links disappeared to.

TTFN.
