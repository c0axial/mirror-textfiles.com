     A bit of international news, and then nothing...?  Hmmm...I would
     have suspected much more going on worlwide in FidoNet than just one
     issue's worth of news.

     As it is, enough mail has trickled through in the FidoNet Technical
     Standards Committee to generate the need for a decision, and under
     the rules of the FTSC, public input is requested, as presented below,
     and taken from the FTSC_PUBLIC echo.  No formal notice was sent to
     the FidoNews...which seems odd for an intent of soliciting public
     input.

     Doc Logger appears yet again, along with an interesting observation
     of his writing and prose.

     In general news and information, it appears that more and more people
     seem to feel that trying matters in the 'court of public opinion' has
     more weight and value than trying to resolve matters through the very
     simple process established within FidoNet Policy.

     Moreso when claims of legal action are bandied about by those with
     little or no legal experience to assess the validity of these claims.
     If nothing else, this should be amusing to watch.

     On another note, the message I received from a node in the former
     Soviet Union has not been followed up by the writer.  It would be
     most interesting to hear from the "Quiet Giant" in Zone 2 and get a
     perspective that many in the West do not have available to them.

     If nothing else, it would be an interesting forum for the discussion
     of the formation of "Zone 7", and offering both a true and earnest
     representation of those who had no voice before.

     Also, it would seem that more people are discovering Adrian Walker's
     "so long and thanks for all the fish" message, posted on his website.

     It's interesting to see so many cast blame and accusations over this,
     but so far only see two people actually propose to do anything about
     the loss of the EchoList management of tags.

     For those of you who don't know, Adrian has apparently decided to
     shut it down without offering the code to run it.  Certainly, that is
     his perogative...after all, it _is_ his code.

     But my feeble attempt to recall the past remembers that his
     predecessor, Mike Fuchs, offered to make _his_ code available at the
     least to his successor, but the offer was refused...am I incorrect in
     my recollection of this?

     And, on a last note...

     I receive a number of commercial E-Mails from various companies and
     FIDONEWS 15-22               Page 2                    1 Jun 1998


     corporations around the world, offering 'free trial' software or
     equipment, or offering 'discounts' on the same...

     Should I post these in the FidoNews each week, or not?

     Your input is welcome on the idea...these are not paid advertising,
     nor is there usually any graphics attached.  These are generally
     press releases from these companies.

     However, I'm not at all certain if these would be appropriate to
     include.  On the one hand, they are commercial; on the other hand,
     these often include materials of general interest to sysops.

     Feel free to contact me at 1:1/23, or at editor@fidonews.org.

     Loggerhead is borirrrrrring
       by Bob "Bobo I" Moravsik

     Each week the nodes that read Fidonews must mechanically
     skip over the drival written by Doc (doctor of buffoonery)
     Loggerhead.   Its the same old stuff:

     Dear Rev Whatever....

     Then some bellowing about Satti...Zorch and Kohl.

     This is followed by a paragraph on "peefour"
     a document that has words larger then 5 letters.
     Loggerhead shows he hasn't yet gotten to section
     8.  Doc...to modify Fidonet's policy one
     must restate it then get 50%+1 of the RC's
     to present it to the IC for a *C vote.  Sorry
     but any other way ya got a document that shares
     one property with you...being a phony,

     Hey...Satti ain't perfect but he's the IC and ZC1.
     Kohl ain't perfect but he's the RC10.  Loggerhead
     ain't perfect and he's a buffoon.  What these
     guys do is a lot more constructive then the
     repititious ravings that Loggerhead stuffs into
     Fidonews.  Maybe we should have two additions:

      Fidonews I for the regular nodes and Fidonews II

     with Doc Buffoon's column that will someday
     line the cages of electronic birds.

     Give it up Loggerhead....you are like a fire
     dectector...all noise...no substance.  You waste
     bandwith in the echo and seem to have attracted
     no allies.  I guess when one is a doctor of buffoonery
     and stuff white powder your his nose all day...your
     keyboard is your only outlet.

     Go away...leave Fidonet to normal people.

     Dear Editorbeing,

     This article is submitted by Doc Logger(163/110) who was
     awash in mashed bananas which he was gumming in teary-eyed
     nostalgia about the good old days. Of course, for Logger,
     the "good old days" are anything that happened before
     yesterday but that is a minor semantic quibble.

     Roll da flic, Zorch....

     Dear Reverend Visage,

     This may be longer than my usual bird cage liner because it
     represents a sort of milestone in my less than sterling
     pursuit as a Fidonet columnist. There have been
     miscellaneous articles and letters before I started
     sequentially numbering them, but this represents the 50th
     column that I have submitted in the format of letters to
     you. The fact that you are stuck in a Thai bordello with
     opium vacuity in your eyes, large lizards trying to eat your
     spleen, and vicious nightmares involving Henry Kissinger
     tormenting your every waking hour, are all of small
     consequence to me. I've already become independently wealthy
     by selling the future rights to your brain. Surprisingly,
     the Smithsonian Institute was outbid by a small tribe in
     Borneo who claimed that it must represent the largest
     earthly repository of pure Ibogaine.

     I meant to start off with something sentimentally touching
     like "Roll da flic, Zorch, Tom, Thom, Dale, Vince, Tim,
     Sylvia, Donald & Christopher.." In honour of all the
     Fidonews editors who have seen fit to include my weaselings
     in the esteemed Snooz organ. It is a great credit to all the
     people on the list that the Snooz at least withstood the
     slings and arrows of outrageous elflords and remained true
     to its purpose. It is not as if there weren't moments when
     Fidonews was in peril, particularly from elflords like
     Bonine and the occasional whining from Dallas Hinton. I have
     just completed reading all the Fidonews that have ever been
     issued and what a strange and interesting history it
     represents.

     I'd would like to roll back a few pages and talk about the
     Glory Days of Fidonet. (If it isn't too much trouble, you
     may want to cue up some sentimental music...something that
     stirs the heart... y'know, music with tubas and all-nude
     majorette dancing girls.) I have in my study, a faded and
     yellow print-out of a chat I had with Bert Binary in
     December, 1985. He had just set up his BBS and we were
     discussing the concept of creating an echomail conference
     FIDONEWS 15-22               Page 5                    1 Jun 1998


     that could be passed between our systems. During the
     conversation, a spider strolled across Bert's monitor. The
     spider became a topic of discussion and somehow got named
     "Spike." The echomail conference became "Spike's Bar" - a
     sort of semi-fiction, roman au clef, circus, roadshow and
     irreverent conversation echo. I subsequently discovered that
     the echomail conference was among the first of what were
     ultimately called "rogue" echos. It propagated outside the
     backbone structure reaching Vienna, Montana and occasionally
     we would get strange and incomprehensible netmail from
     Australians who had somehow linked into the echo.

     What made the echo remarkable was the the messages were
     creative, witty and there were *hundreds* of them every day.
     I do mean messages, and not the quote-'N- grunt vulture shit
     that permeates echomail conferences today. One of the Great
     Themes that emerged in that echo was the delicious pastime
     of satirizing the various presumptive rulers of Fidonet. In
     general, we chose local targets but since that represented
     the era where Tom Kashuba's many personalities reigned, it
     was a rich environment for poking fun at the morons.

     Spike's Bar was where you made your echomail debut with the
     immortal line: "Your lips are like two roses in dung." You
     brought us Lucie LaFlamme whose short-short skirts and whose
     Franglais language was a great amusement. Out of Spike's
     Bar, five full length cheesy electronic novels were spun
     off.

     So, at this moment, I'd like to hoist another glass of
     Ibogaine to Spike, and all his characters and friends who
     gave me years of enjoyment from Fidonet. It is an acute
     embarrassment that I have been reduced to an old troll whose
     message output is almost entirely devoted to poking sticks
     at dumb, confused Fido elflords. If I were honest about it,
     which I'm rarely inclined to be, I'd say that a great deal
     of my disgust with the Fido elflords has to do with the fact
     that their intrusions led all of us to get lost in the
     process and to forget that the medium is capable of magic
     moments.

     The second nostalgic event is of a savage and ugly nature.
     I'd read Fido admin echos with detached amusement as the
     elflords battled with serfs, and as tyrants like Bonine
     stamped their jackboots across the noble dream that Tom
     Jennings had created. The only "political" inclinations I
     had concerned my absolute joy and wonder that a whole
     network could be created with anarchy as its guiding
     premise. The militantly public domain status of some of the
     early software, the lack of commercial domination, and the
     fact that it joined a world - were all things that caused me
     to marvel in wide-eyed amazement.

     The event, which was 10 or 11 years ago, that toppled me
     from  complacency was a netmail message from a friendly
     local sysop who advised me that I really ought to attend the
     FIDONEWS 15-22               Page 6                    1 Jun 1998


     upcoming Net163 sysop meeting because on the agenda was a
     resolution to remove my nodenumber for "bringing Fidonet
     into disrepute." I did attend the meeting and was stunned
     that the issues involved the International propagation of
     the Spike's Bar echo. This may sound incredible now, but the
     theses of the sysop who proposed the resolution was that
     Fidonet was a medium whereby sysops should be "serious"
     exchanging technical information or talking about computers
     or software. In the proponent's mind, there was no place or
     room for fun in Fidonet and certainly no allowance should be
     given to an echo which featured a spider who worked as a
     bartender.

     Our NC at the time, a fellow named Al Hacker who had all the
     literate skills of a Bob Kohl and half the brains, took the
     resolution seriously. I glanced around the room and it
     occurred to me that the NC, the NEC, and all of the HUBS ran
     Mail Only systems. Not only did they not have human callers,
     but the only messages they ever wrote were self-referential
     commentary of how many kilobytes (it *was* kilobytes in
     those days) of mail they moved through their systems.
     Fidonet to them was all form and no substance. It was a
     mechanism and not a medium.

     When I asked why the other sysops would care about an echo
     which went out on my dime when it left the net, or went by
     non-Hub routed means within the net, their answer was
     equally amazing. They said that only *they* had the right to
     move mail and only *they* had the right to determine whether
     content was appropriate. In fifteen minutes of insane
     discussion I heard enough proprietary declamations to choke
     a whale. It was "their net" or "my nodes", or "my mail Hub"
     etc. etc. on and on. Another social observation became
     obvious as I looked around the room at the various people
     who were laying claim to dominion over various aspects of
     Fidonet. In every case, whatever titles they'd acquired in
     Fidonet were their highest achievements in life. They were
     variously unemployed, low level government clerks, janitors,
     hotel bell hops - but not one of them in real life had
     either the skills or the education to rise to management.
     But there they were, infesting Fidonet, and like any long
     disfranchised class, they were hell-bent on flexing the only
     power they'd ever acquired in life.

     Mercifully, the resolution to hoof me from Fidonet was
     narrowly defeated. The incident caused me to look at the
     Fidonet elflord structure and I realized that there was a
     stunning overpopulation of similar real-life failures
     occupying elflord positions. It is no small wonder that this
     collection of mutants tried to foist Peefour on what they
     hoped would be a somnolent populace. These cretins needed
     rules because they had no shreds of judgment of their own.
     They needed the lash of policy to inflict their totalist
     revenge on everyone and everything that they should have
     recognized was the only prayer for freedom they ever could
     achieve. A generation of swine, to steal Thompson's phase,
     FIDONEWS 15-22               Page 7                    1 Jun 1998


     burrowed like maggots into Fidonet's structure and gave
     viability to every sniveling, whining, social misfit who had
     an ax to grind and a keyboard with which to file a policy
     complaint.

     If you have the right music on, and you squint your eyes
     just a tiny bit to catch the contrail, you can see the
     trajectory from Dodell through Bonine and Peace all the way
     to Satti. A lineage of wild peccaries who took as their
     anthem the sanctity of a policy document and who fiddled
     while Rome was burning. We have Kohl whose pathology is
     devouring Region10 and we have Bob "noted" Satti with all
     the management skills of Euglena; telling us that "they are
     bound by policy." It used to be that humanity was bound by
     common sense and the civilizing influence of justice. That,
     I think, was when there were people with the strength of
     character to make decisions.

     The third rumination concerns my first letter to Fidonews. I
     remember sitting at the computer, filled with trepidation
     about whether I should send it. I feared that Tom Jennings
     would never publish something from a fido serf, particularly
     because the tenor of the letter was to swing large broadaxes
     at a collection of Fido elflords. To my joy and amazement,
     Tom not only published the letter but sent me a kind netmail
     suggesting that the whole network could use my kind of
     irreverence. Tom didn't know it then, but his words were
     like giving milk to a stray kitten.

     Whenever I had doubts about whether Fidonet had fallen under
     a cloak of despair and sycophancy towards the elflords, I
     merely had to look at the netmail responses to my various
     articles. To all of those people who wrote, even the ones
     who wanted to carve out my liver, I thank you. To those
     whose writings in Fidonet I admired most - it is sad that
     most of you are gone, even though there was a consensus
     among you that writing for Fidonews was "proselytizing to
     gas station attendants." I dearly miss the energy and
     literacy that a fair number of people devoted to their
     messages.

     Anyway, those are my flashbacks from an earlier Fidonet era.
     I realize that the last worthy windmill to tilt at is in the
     lack of content of echomail messages. I also know that my
     opinion represents a very tiny minority. It is infinitely
     ironic that in one of Fidonet's echo conferences devoted to
     writing, there are only a couple of people who actually take
     the care to write as opposed to barf back previous messages
     while adding their own minor trail of phlegm to the end.
     I've recently had occasion to read nine doctoral theses of
     people who were recently blessed with the title "PhD" and I
     was appalled that not one of them possessed basic
     communication skills or even knew how to write a coherent
     sentence. It caused me to muse that knowledge without the
     means to use it or convey it is a trivial pursuit. When I
     give business seminars at one of the local high school, I
     FIDONEWS 15-22               Page 8                    1 Jun 1998


     give the students a choice of submitting either a ten
     thousand word essay or four paragraphs of cogent and
     original thought. I rarely get students choosing to write
     four paragraphs.

     In a couple of weeks I shall toss the cameras into my
     mid-life crisis car and go on a driving adventure.
     Eventually I'll meet up with a collection of friends who
     convene once a year to embarrass each other about past proud
     assertions that we were going to change the world. For some
     of us, merely surviving in the world is triumph enough.
     We'll talk about the novels we never got around to writing,
     or the fact that our art isn't gracing galleries across the
     country, or the fact that we aren't in politics making some
     sort of difference, or the fact that we gave up acting
     careers for something as pedestrian as wanting to be able to
     pay the rent. As a group, we need to torture ourselves with
     these failures of nerve and spirit. We also want to wish on
     our children the old resolve to go out and make a difference
     in some fashion while suppressing the fear that their
     generation will be riding the downward side of the asymptote
     where dreams and reality are implausible partners.

     I've already written too much. Poor Dallas' lips must be
     horribly bruised and the batteries must be dead on Kohl's
     Speak 'N Spell. I must go Visage, and this has nothing at
     all to do with the fact the car is rumbling ominously with
     tanks full of nitro-methanol, *serious* driving music racked
     up in the dash CD player, and a need to get back out there
     to reset the edge.

                             GETTING TECHNICAL
     =================================================================


     Hello All.

     We currently have a case of a FTSC Standing Member who has decided to
     become a point instead of staying a node. He is willing to continue
     as member if allowed.

     The problem is that FTA-1001 requires members to be nodes. I don't
     know the background for this requirement, since I was not around when
     the document was originally drafted.

     FTA-1001 is only amendable after public input, so I am asking this on
     behalf of the FTSC: May Standing Members be points as well as nodes?

     Please give your input during the next three weeks, after which I
     will summarize and make a decision based on your input.

     Thank you.

     Odinn
