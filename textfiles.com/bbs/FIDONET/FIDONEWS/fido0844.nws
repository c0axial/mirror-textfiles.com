Editorial: Editorial... or message from the stars?

by Tom Jennings (1:1/1)

Warning: this is rather long. The whole middle part is about history,
and power. It is editorializing at its worst. Skip to the next group of
*'s if this displeases you. (You were warned.)

                                * * * * *

Another dull week here in FidoNewsville. I have good news, and I have
bad news. The good news is, I found a replacement for the aging hard
disk I've been using here for some time, given to me by Vince Periello
as a bribe to get me to go to FIDOCON91. It worked, so did the drive,
and now that the event's over, the drive seems to be headed for history
too. Admittedly, it was old to start with, and I spun it 24 hrs/day for
a year, so I can hardly complain. It never failed me, but started
getting senile in the high sectors. Its replacement is a 3.5" 80 meg
SCSI drive. It's soooo q-u-i-e-t...

But anyways I'm avoiding the point, which is I lost an article. I wish I
could blame it on the disk, but I did it myself, by "MOVE *.ART
\FIDONEWS", only I moved the directory and it mashed all the files into
one little pile. Only the last one was saved.

And another article, of some importance, was never delivered, for some
unknown technical reason.

                        * * * * *

Personally, I've heard a few references to "anarchy" in FidoNet this
week alone, and Thom Henderson has something to say about it too (and I
agree with the gist of his article).

I do wish people were more into anarchism than anarchy. Look it up.

Along these lines --

I bet you didn't know that REGIONS ASSIGNED THEIR OWN IMPORTANCE. Never,
ever, were nets "part of" or contained within regions. Here's the
original story, much condensed.

In 1985 there were only "nodes". Just a flat, point to point scheme. (As
most #)$(&* mailers treat the net today, but I'm jumping ahead). After
only a few times of having Fido make a bunch of calls to the same city
accross the country to deliver one message each, this thing now known as
"host routing" became quite obvious. At first it was done with a simple
text substitution in Fido's packet. It later became the full-featured
router that Fido still contains, and most system simplement in some way.

FidoNews 8-44                  Page 2                       4 Nov 1991


It next became obvious that FidoNet nodes "clumped" together where human
population was densest; cities, mainly. The NET/NODE addressing scheme
became a formal definition of the incoming host (the /0) we'd been
manually entering, and the nodes surrounding it kept their same node
numbers, but became part of the local net.

As a short example, nodes 4 10, 22, 16, 17, all in St. Louis Missouri,
used 16 as "incoming host" which redistributed mail delivered to it for
nodes 4, 10, 17, 22, etc. The incoming host remained as node 16 (in this
case) but also the magic value "0". The net was named "100", so they
became 100/4, 100/16... and the host, 100/0. (There was a cute trick to
allow transparent backwards compatibility to non-net-aware software that
worked reasonably well.)

It was important that the addressing scheme of NET/NODE be consistent
throughout the net, but many nodes simply weren't near any other nodes,
certainly none within the telco parameters that made for a "local call"
(US telco includes calls to a limited area as part of the monthly fee;
very advantageous for FidoNet!)

Since the outlying nodes could be hundreds of miles/KMs from the nearest
net (nearly 1000 miles here in the West!), we formed the idea of the
REGION.

Read this next part carefully; you'll need to un-learn the current
REGION scheme to understand it.

We picked large, arbitrary chunks of the country (US-only then,
remember) and named them "regions". Each had a host (/0), who did
exactly what a net host did; keep a list of nodes in their region. The
difference was, the region/0 merely kept the list of nodes NOT OTHERWISE
IN A NET. Period.

As the net grew, and nodes appeared, they'd be distributed again amongst
population density boundaries. The number of nodes in a region would
grow, making more work for the region host, but at some point a "clump"
of nodes would appear (in a new city, for instance) and that clump would
split off -- into a new net, thereby lowering the workload of the region
host. The region hosts actual, constant workload then grew at a rate
much lower than the network overall.

There was much more planning and understanding of the social scheme and
organization than is appreciated. I hadn't realized just how lost the
original process had gotten until recently when talking to people who've
been around since 86 or so. It's kinda depressing, actually.

I created FidoNews in 1984 or 85 to act as a "metanetwork", to give us a
method to talk about the network itself, and to provide a forum for our
other, non-technical and non-FidoNet communications needs. (And within a
few months, I had an article by an ex-military guy complaining about
retirement issues, for which I got questioned on for appropriateness. (I
wasn't flamed; that didn't happen then. No it wasn't the "good ole
days"; it was simply a much, much smaller crowd.)

But anyways -- REGIONS were never, ever meant to be anything more than a
net host. The current power mongering started when the nodelist-fragment
collection scheme was given to the region hosts, and they grew it from
there.

Nets are *not* contained in regions. The model was mathematical, not
geographical. Sets, not political groupings. I find it all very
depressing.

Last and far from least, and no one will believe this I'm sure, it
sounds so far-fetched in today's locked-down bully/boss-ridden thug net,
but -- Overthrow was designed in from the start, and discussed
explicitly by everyone involved, as an integral part of the checks and
balances. The /0 was NOT supposed to be a position of power, but a
position of *responsibility*, on a paper throne.

If the net host was a complete jerk, the net members could create a new
nodelist fragment themselves, and pass it on. Votes? "Permission" from
"above"? Screw that shit. Toss 'em out on their ear!

Every sysop in FidoNet, including and especially myself, is responsible
for letting this happen. We gave the bullies their power. It is not, and
never, too late.

Keep this in mind. You might need it some day. Maybe this is how we got
here though. It wasn't meant to be a machanism for bullies to get their
way, but for otherwise-tolerant ordinary sysop folx, who get fed up, to
work around the 0 and replace them with someone less obnoxious. Anything
can be abused.

Most people aren't used to having control of their lives. When given to
them, they freak out and get stupid, and think they ahve to emulate the
jerks, since they're the only thing around as a model. Oh well.


PS: did you know that HOST ROUTING IN FIDONET IS MANDATORY?! Fer #$*#$%
sakes!!! What in hell do you think the damn #$#$@# net/0 node is for?!
Prestige? To push people around? Banish people you don't like? The 0th
node is supposed to accept mail for all nodes within their net, and
forward that mail onward, without fail, barring hardware failure,
without comment, editorial or censorship, and it better be a damn good
excuse. Period. If you don't like it, don't be a /0.

                                * * * * *

Which brings me to my original (for today) thought -- I'm now collecting
historical fragments from our colorful past. I especially want things
from pre '86, or even '87. You'd be surprised how little I have.

I don't even have a copy of the original MAILER document that I
generated before I coded FidoNet in winter/spring 85. I would dearly
love to have a copy. Probably only the first dozen nodes ever saw a
copy.

Don't be afraid to send me stuff you think I might already have, as I
probably don't, and even if I get one later, I will appreciate the
thought, truly! I'm not sure what I'm going to do with this stuff, but I
want to get it together before it's all lost. If you have non-electronic
things, my mailing address is: Tom Jennings, Box 77731, San Francisco CA
94107. I swear I'll reimburse you for any postage it takes to mail me
stuff.

                            Fear of Flying

What is it that some people find so scary about democracy?  For a very
long time I was a lot more involved than I should have been in giving
sysops some say in how the net is managed.  That particular effort
failed for a number of reasons that I'd prefer not to go into (at
least partly because some of them were my fault), but still it irks me
to hear people disparage the very idea of ever giving the "grunt
sysop" a say -- everything from offhand references to "smarmy
meetings" to one notable who characterized the whole effort as "nasty
nasty nasty awful awful awful".

I know that politicians have given organized meetings a bad name, but
the fact of the matter is that Robert's Rules of Order are designed to
ensure that all viewpoints are aired -- ALL viewpoints!

When I accepted Chairmanship of the late IFNA, it was with the
understanding that we would do either one of two things:  either we
would turn it into the elected leadership of fidonet, or we would get
rid of it.  I wanted the former, but I accepted the latter by
consoling myself with the thought that at least now it would be easier
for the sysops to erect a new structure without repeating the mistakes
of the original.  That hasn't happened, and shows no sign of
happening.

Some people will tell you that it isn't needed, that fidonet as it
stands is the perfect anarchy with total freedom for its members.  A
few of them may even believe it.

But most sysops know better, from personal experience.  There ARE
people running things.  People are told what software to run and what
software not to run.  People are told which conferences they may or
may not have and how they must obtain them.  Fidonet is a hierarchical
dictatorship, with the dictators responsible only to those above them;
never to those they are supposed to serve.

Yes, I know that traces of democracy exist within fidonet.  Nets have
been known to elect their own NC, and even a region or two has been
known to elect its RC.  But take a close look at how and why.  It's
always been by suffrance of the dictators.  Maybe your last NC let you
elect your current NC, but NOTHING requires your current NC to let you
elect another.  There are network wide policies in place that are
intended to affect you on a daily basis where less that one percent of
the people were even consulted about whether or not they were a good
idea, and nothing gives YOU any say on the matter at all.

In an anarchy you can do anything you like, but you haven't got that.

In a democracy you have a say in how things are run, but you haven't
got that either.

What DO you have?

Abstract: Electronic net publication INTERTEXT

INTERTEXT is an ASCII version of an all-fiction publication edited by
Jason Snell at Univ. Cal. at San Diego (address below). I've seen only
Vol. 1 No. 1, dated Mar/Apr 91. I presume there are others.

CONTACT INFO:

Editor: Jason Snell (jsnell@ucsd.edu)
Assistant Editor: Geoff Duncan (sgd4589@ocvaxa.cc.oberlin.edu)
Assistant Editor: Phil Nolte (NU020061@vm1.NoDak.edu)

(I know this is FidoNet and not the internet, but there's interesting
stuff out there. Maybe some interested parties with access to both nets
can cross-post it. If so, please drop a note to FidoSnooze care of Tomj
1:1/1 and I'll announce what FidoNet node it's available on. (No I'm not
volunteering :-)

Since I'm lazy, I'll let the editor speak for his own publication:

        FirstText / JASON SNELL

        [...]

        What do I expect from this magazine? All I really
        want to do is bring good stories to the people
        who subscribe. I'll be hunting down stories on any
        subject from all over the network, and hopefully we
        can put out an issue every two months. I'm hoping
        to alternate with the publication schedule of QUANTA,
        so the two magazines will dovetail into a semi-monthly
        production schedule.

          QUANTA, if you didn't know, is a bi-monthly net
        magazine -- and its specialty is Science Fiction.
        InterText, on the other hand, is for all kinds of
        fiction. I don't mind publishing SF here, but since
        Quanta is an established magazine with a specific
        format, I'd expect most of the SF to go there.

          Dan Appelquist's "Anticipation of the Night" is a
        fascinating piece of work... quite strange, yes, but
        very interesting. His other story, "A War in the Sand,"
        was sort of written because of the cover of the PostScript
        version of this issue. (The cover is a drawing of a dove of
        peace sitting atop a tank in the middle of the desert.) I
        sent Dan a template of InterText that jokingly listed a
        story called "War in the Sand." I guess Dan took me up on
        it. Anyway, those stories and the closing pieces by Greg
        Knauss ("The Talisman," a loopy Stephen King parody, and
        "Schrodinger's Monkey," a deep contemplation of quantum
        mechanics and bananas) form what I'd like to think of as
        a pair of strange bookends: two to welcome you to this
        first issue and two to wrap it up.

        In between are Nolte's "Direct Connections," (which we're
        printing under sad circumstances -- Phil gave it to me
        only after AMAZING STORIES rejected it), a story by me,
        and stories by Andrea Payne and Mary Anne Walters. I
        thank everyone for submitting and helping me out with this
        issue.

If you have access to the internet, back issues (presumably this
includes current ones) are available from network.ucsd.edu, in directory
'intertext'. Both ASCII and PostScript versions are available.

           A way to make the nodelists more or less unnecessary.
           =====================================================

By: Nils Hammar
2:204/90@fidonet.org
4341@msg.abc.se
nils@f109f.mil.se

                             INTRODUCTION
                             ============

The nodelist of today is usually used by the mailer to know when to
send crash mail and direct mail to other nodes than the usual host.
Another use is to determine if the recipient node really exists, and
warn the user about the possible nonexistence of the addressed node.

When you send netmail to another node, you would almost always have
got some information from that node before. This information is
usually a netmail, an echomail message, but can also be some kind of
a document (like this one).

This gave me the idea of implementing a method about how to transmit
the most necessary nodelist information without using the nodediffs
used today.

FidoNews 8-44                  Page 9                       4 Nov 1991


As far as I know, the sysop names and the node names isn't used very
often, and can usually be omitted. Especially the node names changes
now and then, and is never reliable. The nodename is also very often
occuring in the origin line. The sysop names are more constant, and
may as well be distributed the same way as the tecnical information.

                              GOAL
                              ====

The goal is to find another way to distribute the necessary tecnical
nodelist information to the nodes that really needs this information.
The distribution must use the known paths and methods of distribution
that is used today.

                        SHORT DESCRIPTION
                        =================

The method is to use a pair of kludges to distribute the necessary
information. The existence of those kludges will be limited, and they
will only be distributed at a maximum once per week for each echomail
area for each node. This will limit the expansion of the echomail
volume. The kludges may however always exist in netmails, because
netmails are going other ways, and they are a minor part of the
distributed information in FidoNet.
The kludges I am thinking of are one pure tecnical, and one
that identifies the sysop of the originating node.

                           LIMITATIONS
                           ===========

The only problem is when sending a direct netmail to an unknown
node, and it is that neither the phone number nor the technical
possibilities or limitations are known.
This problem is possible to get around by either adding this
information manually to the local nodelist, or send the netmail
to a known *C closer to that node or send the netmail with the
usual routing.

                        THE TECNICAL KLUDGE
                        ===================

This kludge is used to distribute the tecnical information about the
originating node, such as modem protocols, packing methods, preferred
packing method and phone number. If the node is a private node, this
information will be valid for the host of that node instead.
This kludge will also allow points to distribute their phone numbers
if they like.

The kludge will have the following format:

^AMF: BACD4%23#46-19-120103

FidoNews 8-44                  Page 10                      4 Nov 1991


Where "MF" stands for "My Flags", and the following information is:

Characters "A" to "Z" is compression method supported by the node:

A       Compression with ARC (PKPAK 3.61)
B       Compression with ZIP 1.10
C       Compression with LHARC 2.11
D       Compression with ARJ 2.20
E       Compression with Compress (Usually UNIX nodes supporting this)
F       Compression with ZOO 2.10
G-Z     To be defined and used in the future for compression programs.

The number of compression flags should be limited to maximum four, and
with the preferred compresson method as the first flag.
No compression flag means that the node doesn't support any of the
specified compression methods.

Characters "0" to "9" is commonly used CCITT modem protocols.

0       V21               300 bps
1       V22              1200 bps
2       V22bis           2400 bps
3       V32              9600 bps
4       V32bis          14400 bps
5-9     Reserved for future use.

It should only be necessary to specify one of the transmission
methods above. This because a modem with a faster method very
often also supports all of the slower methods.
To indicate a nonsupported protocol, the number may be preceeded
by an exclamation mark ("!"), which only will apply to that specified
protocol. The kludge "^AMF: BACD4!0d#46-19-120103" will tell the
other nodes that the CCITT V21 protocol isn't supported, but the
Bell 103 protocol is. This situation isn't too rare, and should be
considered when setting the flags. It can also be used if calls
for a speed below a specific limit will be denied.

Characters "a" to "z" are used for non CCITT modem protocols, and
uncommon CCITT protocols.

a       HST             9600 & 14400 bps

A node can have none, some or all of the flags above. However,
I don't think that there is any node that supports both the PEP
and the HST protocol at the same line at the same time.

The "%" character indicates the time zone difference, and is useful
when determining ZMH. Valid values are 00 to 23, which is number of
hours relative to UTC (GMT).
This time information is always two characters to make it easy
to parse. If the field is omitted UTC (GMT) is assumed.
For nodes in western europe, this field will usually have
the value 23.

The "#" character indicates that a phone number is following.
There will not be any more flags after the phone number.
There is no maximum length of the phone number field.

The flags that indicates error-correction and/or compression in the
modem is left out because they are not really useful information.
This handshake is done when establishing a session, and doesn't
need to be stored or distributed.

                          THE SYSOP KLUDGE
                          ================

This kludge isn't at all as necessary and useful as the tecnical
kludge, but will sometimes be useful.

The kludge is called "SY" for "SYsop name", and has the
following format:

^ASY: Nils Hammar

This kludge only contains a plain text string, and is only
distributed at maximum once a week. This kludge will always apply
to the true originating node, and not the boss node, or host node,
because this information is connected with the true address, while
the tecnical information is connected with the closest dialable node
to the real node.
(The closest callable node is often the node itself.)

* PROPOSED ECHO:  A Generation of New Men

by David Fisher (1:170/110)
Proposed FidoNet Echo:  A Generation of New Men

Men's lives are changing.  There is a rising current of healthy
questioning and re-evaluation of our definition as men and the
positions we hold in society.  It is my interest to provide a
place of dialogue where people may participate in supportive and
thoughtful discussion concerning our lives as men.

FidoNews 8-44                  Page 12                      4 Nov 1991


Do you adhere to traditional roles of men as "Provider/Protector?"
Do you see the woman as the primary "nurturer" of the family?  If
so, what are your reasons?  Is there more to maleness than
providing a strong demeanor and an income?  Can a man step beyond
these definitions and still "be a man?"  If so, what are your
reasons?  What does beating drums and sweating in hot tents have
to do with all this?

This Echo is in the formative stages.  In order to make it
available nationally, there must be strong enough interest.  If
you are a Sysop and interested in carrying the Echo, please send
NetMail to Dave Fisher at 1:170/110 stating that interest.  If you
are a user and would like to participate in the Echo, please send
NetMail both to me and your local Sysop indicating your desire.
Or, you may also call my BBS at (918) 481-5715 and leave me a
message there.  I will coordinate and moderate the echo.

The following is an excerpt from the "Rules Document" for the
Echo:

                     A Generation of New Men
                     -----------------------

Synopsis
--------

The forum, A Generation of New Men, is born out of the desire to
dialogue current issues and dilemmas facing men today.  It is
becoming widely common to find men dissatisfied with their current
position in life -- men who have traditionally adhered to values
without discerning thought and healthy questioning of these
values.

Topics will include discussions revolving around the following
areas:

"Daddy Track"

The "Daddy Track" concerns men who have decided to put their
family and kids before their jobs and careers.  Discussions on the
societal pressures and ramifications of their decisions will be
shared in an atmosphere of understanding and respect.

"Men's Movement"

The "Men's Movement" concerns men who have gone beyond the "soft
male" as described by Robert Bly.  Discussions will revolve around
new experiences and expressions of self-identity from the male
perspective.  Whether it's banging on a drum or discovering self-
confidence, all are welcome here.

FidoNews 8-44                  Page 13                      4 Nov 1991


Literature

There is a burgeoning amount of literature emerging as a result of
men coming forward to re-evaluate their position in family and
society.  Discussions will be welcome responding to this
literature (such as Robert Bly's Iron John, Sam Keen's Fire in the
Belly, magazine articles, and others).


                         Governing Rules
                         ---------------

Integrity and Honor
-------------------

The integrity of each participant will be upheld.  When you are
responding to a comment left by another participant, you are
responding to a person.  Given the topic material, there will be
many disagreements.  (For example, is it respectable for a man to
stay at home caring for the children while the woman "brings home
the bacon?")  On this forum, we will learn to disagree with honor
and respect the personal integrity of EVERY person on the forum.

Thus, this form will not tolerate inflammatory remarks.  As well
as destroying the dignity of the person at which they are
directed, they are simply unproductive.

Honesty
-------

Each participant is encouraged to share his views and feelings
openly.  Honest self-evaluation of these views will help create a
healthy atmosphere of dialogue.

Participants
------------

While the forum is generally meant for men (and to provide a
supportive atmosphere for men making some very difficult
decisions), the forum is not limited to men.  Women are encouraged
to participant also.  In truth, their supportive comments will add
a creative addition to the forum.

Language
--------

Language will be kept courteous.  Even though a good curse here or
there is good for the soul, this forum is not the appropriate
place for cursing.  Find a good friend that will listen.  This
includes such euphemisms as a**h***, f*** y**, etc.  Such
inflammatory language is not necessary to express your views on
this forum, and could possibly lead to the violation of the
recipient's integrity.

FidoNews 8-44                  Page 14                      4 Nov 1991


In short, personal attacks, "flames", or "shaming" is NOT allowed.

Quoting
-------

Any message left on this forum may NOT be quoted outside the forum
without the expressed written permission of the sender of the
message AND the recipient of the message.  If you keep an
electronic and/or hard "paper" copy of any of the discussions,
they must not be altered in any way if they are shown to another
party.  If they are shown to another party, please include the
source of their origin as "FidoNet Forum:  A New Generation of
Men".

Since much of the discussions may include sensitive material, the
writers must be protected from potential misuse of their words.

Aliases
-------

The use of aliases or handles are permitted.  The moderator,
however, maintains the right to refuse any alias that he considers
to be in "bad taste".

Availability
------------

This forum is available to any BBS that would like to carry it.

Illegal Activities and Advertising

Illegal activities are not tolerated on this forum.  This would
include not only breaches of National and State laws, but also
breaches of FidoNet policies (such as changing the content of
routed mail, etc.).

Commercial advertising, sales or otherwise, is also prohibited.

   Topic:  New Echo Starting Up !!
Echo Tag:  PET_FORUM


                  -= Pet_Forum Echo =-

A local Echo has started stirring its wilds in the Mobile,
Alabama area.  We requested remote caller's to this system to
help give it a name.  Out of 4 or 5 given selections "Pet Forum"
was obtained.

A local echo that has been the area of fascination for many users
has been the PET_FORUM.  As you may notice, the name is that of a
Pets Echo.

Discussions are open to all area's of pet keeping, and animal
information as well.  The local participants have enjoyed timely
conversation on various topics, such as:  Controlling Flea's and
Ticks, First Aid, Care of Reptiles, Birds, Dog's, Cat's, Horses,
and even Small mammals such as ferrets and hamsters.

We have had joyful discussions over the past year, and would like
to invite others to join in as well.

The PET_FORUM Echo is being originated from
1:3625/454@fidonet.org and will be distributed to REC 18 VIA
1:371/1302 (this nets uplink).  The moderator is a point off of
this system 1;3625/454.14 or if your software doesn't like 4D
point addressing, use out fakepoint address of 1:30815/14 to
contact the moderator, Rodney Harper of Bayou La Batre, Alabama.

The moderator is a full time college student at the University of
South Alabama, and works as a Zoological collector between
quarters.  He has been involved with collecting and breeding
Tropical Fish and Herpetiles for over 15 years, and is quite
experienced in other area's of the pet hobby as well.

*Echo Tag is:  PET_FORUM
No Aliases allowed, No flaming.....
Please try to keep discussion down to pets or pet related topics.
Ask your REC to carry it, so we can get it out on the backbone
soon.

Odyssey: The Fringe Science Network of the Future
by Jerry Woody
1:3607/20

ODYSSEY is an association of Electronic Bulletin Board Systems dedicated
to the research of "Fringe Science" events in our world.  By Fringe
Science we are referring to the U.F.O. phenoneman, Legendary monsters
such as Bigfoot, Yeti and the Loch Ness Monster, and other paranormal
type events such as ghosts, esp, psychic abilities, etc.  As Charles
Forte put it, the scientific community has chosen to ignore information
FidoNews 8-44                  Page 16                      4 Nov 1991


and data concerning fringe science happenings.  ODYSSEY will attempt to
gather, discuss and make public infomation in the most timely and ac-
curate way possible on unusual and fringe science events.

ODYSSEY is different from other Paranormal or Fringe Science nets in
the way that we use echomail and the all important door programs that
add another dimension for the user accessing an ODYSSEY Research Board.
We have the chat echos that discuss UFO's, Monsters and Unknown
Happenings but we also try to use echomail to its fullest potential.
For example, an online door program called UFOBASE not only allows the
user to enter a UFO sighting, but that sighting is formatted in such a
way that it can be 'tossed' into our Skywatch echo for all our users
to study.  Also, a user may upload a sighting in our Skywatch echo via
a pre-formatted form questionaire.  Users and Sysops are assured of
the most up to date fringe science files through networking. Special
programs announces not only the new files available but also gives the
user a brief description and how long it will take to download.  The
new file arrivals are also announced on a special echo.  There is also
a special echo that deals entirely with up to date news clippings
concerning fringe science events and happenings.

Thank you for taking the time to read this article.  If you are a user
and interested in Fringe Science happenings I invite you to access an
Odyssey node nearest you.  If you are a sysop who enjoys running door
programs, wants to add a new dimension to your echomail or have an
interest in Fringe Science happenings, I invite you to join Odyssey.
Accessing and membership in Odyssey is Free. I will be more than
happy to answer any of your questions if netmailed to fidonet address
1:3607/20 or you may log on to the Frontier BBS at 1-205-739-1469
(300 - 19200 *hst* speeds).  For more detailed information you may
FREQ the file  ODYSSEY.ZIP or download it from the BBS.


----------------------------------------------------------------------


   Proposal for 3 new Echomail Conferences:
   or
   The NEED for WOBO!

   WOBO was founded to fill a void and satisify a number of
   needs.

   The need for the development of some form of multi-national
   grouping, began to be felt as long ago as the early 1980's,
   this lead to the World Organisation of Building Officials
   being founded in 1987.

   This perception of need followed on from several practical
   issues being found to be common to many Building officials
   daily workload:-

FidoNews 8-44                  Page 17                      4 Nov 1991


   1- The continuing expansion of international trade and
      commerce.

   2- More and more Building Officials found that they were being
      asked to deal with products that are manufactured in very
      distant countries to different standards.

   3- Architects and Engineers from one country designing
      structures to be located in other countries.

   4- Participation of nations in the Global marketplace.

   5- Rapid development on new (Fast-track) building
      technologies.

   WOBO's purpose as a world organisation is to advance the
   professional status of those engagged in the adminstration
   and enforcement of building codes and standards, and it will
   strive toward the following goals:-

   A) to promote safeguards from potential hazards and to
      recommend solutions for preventing fire risks in existing
      buildings or buildings under construction;

   B) to promote the concept of standardising construction
      materials, equipment and appliances.

   C) to promote unification of legislation pertaining to the
      administration of codes and standards;

   D) to collaborate with international organisations,
      governments and educational institutes to promote the
      development of training programs for Building Officials.

   E) to encourage and promote in all countries the establishment
      of a national Building Officials Organisation.

   F) to promote conferences, seminars and congresses of a
      national and international character in furthering the
      objectives of the organisation.

   So as to effectively carry out its primary objectives of
   advancing education through dissemination of knowledge in
   building science, technology and construction, WOBO wishes
   to encourage the following:

   1) The creation of an information clearinghouse through which
      each participating member can share;

   a) recent technological developments in building products,
      designs and construction which are being introduced in the
FidoNews 8-44                  Page 18                      4 Nov 1991


      marketplaces;

   b) their immediate public safety concerns which relate to the
      building environment; and

   c) information on their nation's building regulatory system
      and means of handling such issues as code adoption and
      changes, standards development, usage, education and
      training of code officials and enforcement personnel,
      liability of code regulatory officials and their approval
      and use of new building technology.

   2) The convening of round-table forums in which all members
      nations and organisations could candidly and freely discuss
      their building regulatory problems and seek common and safe
      solutions to their mutually shared problems.

   3) The sponsoring of symposia through which attendees can hear
      experts in code administration and construction fields and
      hold discussions to seek solutions to commonly shared
      problems in providing for the public's safety in buildings.

   WHO are these BUILDING OFFICIALS????

   Building Officials act as industry regulators and defacto law
   enforcers, in addition to their promotion of high levels of
   safety in and about builidngs and the built environment.

   Nations have, of course, confered these functions on different
   organisations, levels of government and personel.

   So our term "Building Officials" therefore includes such as a
   'Fire Marshal'in the Fire Brigade, as well as ones City/Town
   or County (Council) Authority staff, Regional and State civil
   servants, who may inturn be architects, engineers, surveyors,
   etc.

   Many Building standards are indeed wrote by such Building
   Officials, using their collected experience of building
   materials in real life buildings, and in combination with
   research from the leading Testing Institutes around the World.

   CODES???

   Building standards which are legally enforcable, are often
   termed "codes" and several member organisations of WOBO, have
   codes available on the following:-

   * Model Building Code       * Model Sign Code
   * Model Fire Code           * Model Machnical Code
   * Model Plumbing Code       * Model Security Code
FidoNews 8-44                  Page 19                      4 Nov 1991


   * Model Dwelling Code       * Model Electrical Code
   * Model Administrative Code * Model Swiming Pool Code

   The Model Fire code, in California, for example advises on how
   many Fire Dectectors should be installed in family dwelling
   houses, as well as what is acceptable in a large shoping mall!

   Model code are "drafts" suitable for adoption in a locality by
   the proper legal authority(s).

   In Europe most Nations have a national standards body, and a
   Building Materials testing Body, (UL) (Agremont) and their
   national building laws/codes use these to good advantage.

   Within the European Community, of the twelve nations, after
   1991, no national law or code may prevent construction materials
   or products by virtue of the "its not gotten our (national)
   test certificate" rule, if it can be shown to have a "CE"
   mark, from another EC nation.

   This "CE" mark is a sign that it complies with the European
   Building 'Norm' or EUROCODE or EURONORM. As this is a major
   local problem for myself, I hope my Euronorm echo takes off
   fast. For the first of the "construction Products Directive"
   (European Law) took effect on the 26th of June 1991! So it
   is law now in Europe and England!

   I feel that there is, as yet, a real shortage of suitable
   information on its practical effect, and implementation, and I
   hope the "EURONORM" echo may be one of the more effective ways
   that  Building Official may speak unto Building official,
   canidly and freely.

   Whilst is a International Standards Organisation, this is very
   generic, and WOBO is aimed at the Building Sectors needs.  The
   ISO exists for ANSI,  BSI, CSA, DIN, etc.

   WOBO wishes to act as a link between the regulators and the
   regulated, and to provide a means of ensuring information
   flows and is thus able to be used in buildings to the public's
   safe advantage.

   As a means of enabling of information flow, between both
   Building Code (Law) Authorities and Building officials at the
   human level, I being dwon at the grassroots, as an associate
   member, am proposing the following three (initial) "echomail"
   conferences, as "round-tables" for all interested in the
   Building Industry and its public or private regulation and
   material specification.

   Thus including Builders , Designers and Building Officials, in
FidoNews 8-44                  Page 20                      4 Nov 1991


   a rapid electronic link with global capacity.


   Proposed echos;

   WOBOVIEW  - news and views of the membership of WOBO.

   BUILDCODE - news about building standards, codes and laws
               worldwide.

   EURONORM  - News about the EC (European Community)
               Construction Products Directive(s), and the
               surporting standards and documentation.

               Note. 1992 will see a major outpouring of EC laws
                     on Building Materials and their minimum
                     safety standards, set by the CPD.


   I must stress that these echos are not 'official' media, only
   a means of implementing a practical mode whereby my desire for
   the free flow of technical information on building matters,
   between interested parties, may actually happen regularly,
   and at a cost that small local municipalities can budget for,
   and keep their level of knowldge right up to date.

   AVAILABLITY:

   If you want to carry these echos, they will be available from:-

   LOG-On-In-TYNEDALE  -44-434-60-66-39
   [300 to 9600 HST baud]  2:256/97

   I will (initially) act as moderator at:-

   LOG-on-the-TYNE -44-91-478-6272
   [300 to 2400 baud]  2:256/17

   The Echo names are WOBOVIEW , BUILDCODE and EURONORM


   WOBO's MEMBERSHIP - NEW USERS FOR YOUR BBS!

   I have circulated a postal letter to all of the WOBO@s
   national organisations and I hope that this will in turn
   promote our bulletin boards, and the FidoNet in general.

   I hope that you will find time to demonstrate our FidoNets
   echomail to those who will find out about it for the first
   time, from my letter to the WOBO membership, with which I
   have circulated a cut-down nodelist (Hosts only) to give a
FidoNews 8-44                  Page 21                      4 Nov 1991


   hint at the global fidonetwork.

   Note. Its based on the Nodelist.001 circulated with Opus v1.7x
   in July 1991.

   I hope thus to introduce a large number of new users to all
   our nets around the world.

   It may be that a WOBO-Net may form, but that is far off day in
   the future.

   If your local sysop is interested, the local WOBO chapters may
   in some areas be a source of sponsorship or equipment.


   WOBO STATUS:

   WOBO is a independent body, with consultative status,
   (caterogy II) from the United Nations "Economic and Social
   Council" and UNIDO (United Nations Industrial Development
   Organisation).

   WOBO membership is available to all people who administer or
   control or take part in the building of our build environment.

       Officials,is only $25.00 (US funds)


   I hope that you might display this notice on your own BBS.

   The Writer:

   I work as a Building Control Surveyor, for my home town, and
   as part of a team of 25 staff, administer the UK's national
   (model) Building Regulations, to a population of 213,000 folk,
   in six towns and the surrounding countryside. We inspect over
   1,000 building projects and more than 500 dwelling houses each
   year.

   We also work with the County Fire and Civil Defence Authority
   to help enforce the Fire precautions code, in factories,
   hotels, offices, shops and shoping malls. The largest shoping
   Mall in Europe (The Metro Centre) with 10,000 car spaces is
   within our Borough.

FidoNews 8-44                  Page 22                      4 Nov 1991


   We also deal with the Public Safety Licencing at Showgrounds
   and open-air POP_Music concerts, as well as the several sports
   arenas, within the borough.

   We also act in cases of potentially dangerious buildings and
   similar structures, eg. high winds and storms etc.

   We are a part of the Engineering Services of the locally
   elected Metropolitan Borough Council.

   I beleive that the above tasks would be familar to most
   Building officials around the world.
