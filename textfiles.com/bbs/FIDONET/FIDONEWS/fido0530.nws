          This  article is in reply to Mr. Mednicks article concerning
     his  running  for  a political office. While I do agree with some
     of  the points he raised during our brief telephone conversation,
     I must also express this opinion.


          Mr. Mednick;

           While  I  have  never  met  you, (but am looking forward to
     doing  so at FIDOCON) I must say that your article in FidoNews528
     was  (to  my  way  of  thinking  anyway)  against the precepts of
     FidoNet  as  an  amateur communications network. We should not be
     foisting  the costs (by we I mean the people placing the calls to
     pick  up  Fnews  files) of your political campaign unless we wish
     to  do  so.  Since  we  were not given the choice in the matter I
     feel  that you have done a disservice to us as a hobby network by
     placing this article in Fnews.

          I  just  got  thru  talking to you voice (as you know) and I
     hope  what  I present here is a true and accurate account of that
     call.  I  wish to present your side here also so that there is no
     bias in the matter.

          You  stated  that  you had cleared the article with the IFNA
     BoD  and  (I  think)  the  President of that body. I applaud this
     action  and  can't totally blame you for the results. I must also
     blame  them  (the  BoD)  for  allowing  the  article  to  run.  I
     understand  that  FidoNews  publishes anything that comes in that
     meets  the  technical  requirements and your article does in fact
     meet  them.  I  also  understand  your  view that since there are
     commercial  advertisements in FidoNews that you should be allowed
     to  also  "advertise".  I agree with that premise but I also feel
     that  advertisements  of a commercial nature should be limited to
     1  page in length and only allowed if there is sufficient room to
     do  so  without  making  the file excessively large (say over 40k
     arced  format).  Your article however ran from the top of page 11
     to the bottom of page 14, thus it was 4 pages in length.

          You   stated  that  you  want  to  "champion"  the  computer
     community,  yet  you  only  referred to this in 1 small place and
     the  rest  of  the  article  dealt  with  matters concerning your
     qualifications  as  a  CPA  and  other  matters  not  relating to
     computers.  While  I  agree  that  the  computer  community needs

     (desperately)  someone in Washington who understands the needs of
     the  computer  users, we also need people who are literate in the
     field  of  public  relations and dealing with people. I feel that
     you   did  not  present  enough  information  geared  toward  the
     computer  community  to warrant the space as an "unpaid political
     announcement" in a hobby newsletter.

          Also  I  saw  no  need  of  even  considering  publishing an
     article  worldwide  that  would be of no benefit to those outside
     your   congressional   district  (directly  anyway,  maybe  there
     "could"  be  a  construed benefit to those in the USA given a lot
     of luck).

           This  is not meant to be a flame, nor even a little candle,
     but  is  intended  to inform you that not all who read Fnews will
     view  the  article in the light that I do. I view it as a mistake
     on  the  part  of  the  Administration  of  both IFNA (who really
     should  not  have  a  part  in  what  Fnews  does)  and the Fnews
     publisher.  They  failed  to  properly supervise the operation of
     Fnews  in  that  they  have  now  opened  up our newspaper to the
     infamous    "EQUAL    TIME"    amendment   concerning   political
     announcements  and  editorials,  a  move  that  will cost us (the
     sysops  placing  the  calls,  countless  dollars.  I feel that in
     order  to  be  totally  fair  about  it  you  should contact your
     opponent  in  the  race  and  offer  him  the opportunity to also
     publish a 4 pager in Fnews.

          Well,  I  guess  I have now made enemies of a few more folks
     within  the administration of both IFNA and FidoNet since I blame
     THEM  for even allowing the article in the first place. I realize
     you  are  only  using  the  "avenues open to you" to conduct your
     campaign,  but  please,  (emphasis  mode  ON) NOT HERE. (emphasis
     mode OFF)

     Editor's Note: As far as equal time,  I print anything I receive.
                    This has  been and  will continue  to be my policy
                    until the Publications Committee decides otherwise
                    and presents me with a VERY detailed  list of what
                    is and is not printable (this will  most likely be
                    the same day I resign as editor).  FidoNews always
                    has  been  a  place  where  you could  have almost
                    anything printed.

             SYSOP LIABILITY FOR DISCLOSING PRIVATE MESSAGES

     In what appears to be the first case of its kind, an Indiana law
     student and BBS user has sued a local sysop, Bob Predaina, in
     federal court, claiming that he intentionally disclosed her
     private electronic mail to others without her permission.

     The lawsuit, which is in the early stages and has not reached
     trial, relies upon the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of
     1986 (the "ECPA"), which makes disclosure of private electronic
     mail without consent either of the sender or the recipient a
     federal crime.

     The ECPA does not obligate sysops to offer private mail on their
     systems.  However, if a sysop promises private mail, that promise
     must be kept and the contents of private messages may not be
     disclosed without consent.

     The ECPA provides limited exceptions to the general rule of no
     disclosure.  A sysop may voluntarily disclose to law enforcement
     authorities the contents of a message pertaining to the
     commission of a crime, if read inadvertently by him or if it is
     read pursuant to the exercise of his duties as a sysop.

     Until the courts clarify these rules, sysops who read private
     mail on their systems and disclose it may be playing with fire.
     Prior court cases involving telephone operators have established
     some useful guidelines: an operator may disclose information she
     overheard while checking the line at the user's request, but may
     not disclose information overheard while eavesdropping out of
     curiosity.  Sysops, like phone operators, will not be considered
     to have a blanket authorization to intercept and disclose private
     messages.

               Systems  such  as  Fido 11w which  routinely  make  all
     private mail visible to the sysop are therefore problematic.  BBS
     programmers  should consider making private mail truly  private--
     while allowing sysops to turn the private mail option off if they
     do not want it.

               In the meantime, sysops should reconsider whether it is
     worth  having private mail on their systems and should make clear
     to users in no uncertain terms,  through bulletins and  messages,
     the degree of privacy which can be expected, if any.

               Note:  a copy of the complaint filed in the Thompson v.
     Predaina  case  is  available  on  the  LLM  BBS,   Fido  107/801
     (212)766-3788) in file area 5 under the name "Indiana".
