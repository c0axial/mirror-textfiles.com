Editorial: Still not here

by Tom Jennings (1:1/1)

Your intrepid reporter is still at his secret remote location
somewhere in the Specific NorthWest.

Things are relatively quiet, and I like it. No fires, assasination
attempts, protests outside my door, etc. I'll have to try harder; it
seems I haven't made anyone mad for a few months now.

(Not quite: my one-sentence mention of falling in love invoked the
usual in-passing "good luck!" responses (thanks!), and two amusing
responses: a request that I keep my sexual activities out of FidoNews
(huh?!); the other was CC:'ed to me, a network manager at NCR
informing his clients that he will no longer distribute FidoNews
because of, quote, "the fag and his boyfriend". Sheesh. Can't seem to
please *anybody*.)

This issue is very late, same as last week. I'm having hardware
troubles, same as last week. My BBS/node is a cruddy 286 motherboard
sitting on a phonebook, with the power supply on the shelf next to it,
hard drive and floppy sitting on the modem. The CGA monitor and
keyboard are on the shelf above. Kinda minimal. It looks like hell,
but runs great -- normally. It has gone down four times since I left
town. Murphy's Law or what?! Tim Pozar paid a visit to the ugly box
this morning (Monday) to kick start it. It didn't last; by noon it was
dead again (I'm typing this on my Tandy 200). Had a roommate turn it
on and off. Still dead. Pozar will visit again tonight. I'm sure when
I get home it will be fine again.


FidoCon '92 is coming up; see enclosed article this issue.

The Computers, Freedom and Privacy Conference is coming up in Spring
of '93. I'll keep you posted.

Well that's all for now. I'll be (physically) back in San Fran late
July. Hopefully Pozar won't have to run out here this week again...

Response to:  Netmail and Echomail are Different?
by John Souvestre, 1:396/1, one of the Zone 1 Backbone Hubs

This is a response to an article by Aaron Goldblatt in FidoNews 926.

 AG> Big deal.  Mail is mail.  If it gets there nobody cares, and
 AG> when it gets dropped in the bit bucket it may take months to
 AG> get noticed.

Not net mail.  For example, the main program that I run which "checks"
net mail is Message Track, by Andrew Farmer.  It returns "bad" net
mail to the originator, as much as is possible.

 AG> Tom said a while back that netmail and echomail routing schemes
 AG> are different - they serve different purposes and one should not
 AG> be fed into the routing stream of the other. Sysops who do, he
 AG> implied, take their chances. One should simply pass the netmail
 AG> through the *C system.
 AG>
 AG> Fine as far as it goes.

There really is no *C system to route net mail, except at the net
level as per Policy 4.  There was for a while, but the Backbone has
pretty much replaced it.  Why?  Because it is easier, cheaper, faster
and more reliable.

 AG> If there truly are two different systems to route mail (and
 AG> nothing I've seen indicates that there really is such), ...

Bingo!

 AG> Most of the software commonly used is up to the job, so why does
 AG> the mail disappear?

From what I have seen, there are two main problems:  1) It never
leaves the net where it originated because one of the local Hubs
doesn't understand how to route outgoing net mail.  2) It has a
non-FidoNet destination address.

 AG> The answer may lie in the fallacy that software such as message
 AG> bouncers and Grunged Message Detectors are always bug-free.

The GMD (Grunged Message Detector) program doesn't touch net mail at
all.  It only checks echo mail.  Also, if it decides to not pass a
message it returns it.  It does *not* delete it without returning it.

 AG> Let's assume that most local routing systems are fairly reliable
FidoNews 9-27                  Page 4                      13 Jul 1992


 AG> and mail doesn't get lost, at least at the net level.

Bad assumption.  See above.

 AG> Perhaps the sysops of systems that do (inter)national mail
 AG> transfers, such as Z1C George Peace at 1:13/13, should take a
 AG> look at their systems to make sure their automation doesn't
 AG> occasionally slip up.  Software such as message bouncers,
 AG> Grunged Message Detectors, netmail routers, etc., can have bugs,
 AG> and mail can get fried because of these bugs.

Bad assumption.  We *do* check.

 AG> Perhaps instead of software that simply bounces, returns, or
 AG> deletes  bad mail, what we need on the (inter)national level is
 AG> software that redirects bad or grunged mail to wait for human
 AG> intervention.

Message Track does just that.  So does GMD (for echo mail).

 AG> A perfect example is some echomail I sent recently with a bad
 AG> datestamp.  It was formatted properly and everything, but my
 AG> system clock was set wrong.  At the Zone 1 backbone level, the
 AG> GMD bounces any mail that has a datestamp of more than 30 days
 AG> in the past or more than 24 hours in the future.  The sysop gets
 AG> a nice netmail message back about it.

Bingo!   By the way, your message was bounced by your Region Hub.  It
didn't
get to the Zone level.

 AG> First, why did it go five or six systems up the chain before
 AG> getting bounced?

Because not every Hub runs such software.

 AG> The netmail I got back was from the GMD at an echomail hub about
 AG> five systems up from my boss.

The Region Hub that bounced it was one level above the Net Hub.  Your
net has an unusual arrangement in that it is fed by another semi-local
net, hence your long path, mostly local calls, from the Net Hub who
actually calls long-distance.

 AG> Presumably, PASCAL, INTERUSER, and POLITICS are fed to other
 AG> systems by the intervening four nodes, so why did I have to
 AG> resend the mail after it got that far up to make sure it went
okay,
 AG> because, after all, by resending it, I duped the mail to every
 AG> system below the node with the GMD.  Waste of my time, waste of
 AG> everybody's money.

FidoNews 9-27                  Page 5                      13 Jul 1992


No, not "everybody's", only those 2% or so of the nodes "close" fed by
that Region Hub.  In general, messages older than 30 days are dupes.
Stopping them this same way saves money for 98% of the nodes.  It's a
clear win.

 AG> Maybe what should have happened was my mail should have been put
 AG> in a special place for the sysop to look at, ...

Perhaps you don't realize the volume of such messages in a single day.
That's why the process was automated.

 AG> I'm not saying that I'm sure the GMD, mail routers, or mail
 AG> bouncers, do have bugs that cause them to kill mail, but it's a
 AG> possibility.  We've all had problems with computers where the
 AG> only possible explanation was that you weren't sticking your left
 AG> thumb in your right ear while typing with your big toes.  But the
 AG> software deserves a closer look; SOMETHING is killing the mail,
 AG> and I doubt it's an Act of God.

You have presented no evidence that any software is at fault.

I suggest that you send a test message and then trace it.  Most Hubs
have programs that put "via" lines at the bottom of routed net mail
messages.  Most Hubs have logs that show what routed net mail went
through their system.  It's generally not that hard to find the source
of the problem if you are willing to spend a little time looking for
it.

Regarding the Commercialization of FidoNet via Support Echoes
By: Paul Harney @ 1:107/579
Dated: June 29th 1992

Greetings to you fellow FidoNet members,

The last time I addressed you in this newsletter it was to express
concern regarding an echo which purportedly was to require
a fee paid prior to allowing FidoNet SysOps the ability to be
active in it.  I write this follow up to report to you that this
seems to no longer be the case.

Due in large part to those of you who read my first article and
spoke your mind regarding your personal preference to keep echoes
that required fees from the FidoNet backbone, I have received word
from the echoes FidoNet side Moderator <the conference originates
in the RIME network> Michele Stewert that she has received assurances
from David Terry and CDC that there well not be any restrictions,
as originally reported in the conference rules, by anyone at CDC.
All FidoNet SysOps in good standing will be able to access the echo.
Anyone may post or reply to a post.  The only restriction still invoked
is CDC's request to reserve the right to not reply to anyone their
records show does not have a current account with them.  As no has
the right to tell someone they must respond to a post addressed to
FidoNews 9-27                  Page 6                      13 Jul 1992


them, this presents no problem that I can see.  Others will, as I
said, be free to reply or post as they see fit and an account with
CDC or SaltAir BBS is no longer necessary to access the forum.

I wish to thank Michele Stewert and Butch Walker for handling the
situation in such a complete and comprehensive manner.

I wish to thank those of you who became involved, made your feelings
known, and helped bring this to a swift conclusion.

I trust this proves that the system can work with a little communication
between the users and those who administrate the system for them.

Be well and pax.
Paul Harney

                               VIN_MAISON
                 An Echo devoted to the home wine maker

by Chris Grainger
Exception #13 BBS - 1:163/518

After several months in private distribution, I am quite happy to
announce the availability of VIN_MAISON to all North American systems
via the Zone 1 Backbone.  VIN_MAISON started as a local message base
on my BBS.  Another local sysop noticed the area and asked if we could
turn it to an echo and share the wealth so to speak.

The echo quickly spread throughout systems in the Ottawa area.  Soon,
systems in British Columbia, Washington, and Montreal were
participating. After several queries from nets in Dallas and Raleigh,
I decided it might be time to apply for a more widespread distribution
of the echo.

FidoNews 9-27                  Page 9                      13 Jul 1992


Why make your own wine?  I once thought that.  Why should I invest
money and time into a hobby that's gonna turn out schlock?  Believe
me, I've tasted home made wine before and it was terrible.  However,
the kits you can buy now are practically foolproof.  You can make just
about any style of wine you want.  If you like Bordeaux's, you can
make them.  If you prefer Beaujolais styles, by all means, buy the kit
and make it. Italian, German, Yugoslavian.... the possibilities are
endless.  If you get really hooked, you can even search out your own
fruits and make wine from scratch.

I must say, I get particular pleasure in serving wine I have made to
friends.  I tend to go overboard at bottling time and design my own
labels to fix on the bottles.  Most don't realize they are drinking
home made wine til they take a real close look at the bottle.  Another
thing that I've noticed is that I'm never short a bottle to bring to
dinner. You know the feeling, dinner party, in a rush, get home from
work, wash, change, rush out to the local grog shop only to discover
it closed. [grin]

I moderate VIN_MAISON but am by no means an expert in the art of
making wine at home.  However, several knowledgable people take part
in the discussions and one can learn much from participation in the
echo.  So, if you are a rank beginner or a seasoned veteran with
countless fine vintages to your credit, please consider picking up the
echo from your local hub and having a peek.

How many people out in Fido land are members of the second largest
Protestant denomination?  If you are a United Methodist, keep reading!
(if not, you are welcome to continue reading, too!)

I have formed an echo called UNI_METH.  This is an echo for members &
non-members of the United Methodist Church to talk about what is going
on in the Church, and to ask questions about things such as: beliefs,
the Ritual, the Discipline etc etc.

All people are more than welcome to use this conference.  In keeping
with the ecumenical spirit of the United Methodist Church, all people of
any religion or non-religion are allowed to pick up this conference.

So, if you are interested, send mail to Chris Spray at 1:373/14.  We are
operating on a USRobotics Dual Standard, so speed should not be a
problem.  Just tell me that you are interested in picking up the echo,
and I'll go into TosScan and add you in to the fellowship!

God bless!
