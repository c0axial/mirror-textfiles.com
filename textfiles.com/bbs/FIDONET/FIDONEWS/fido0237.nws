          ============================================================
          
                             A New Look for Fidonews
          
          We've made some  changes  here.  I  finally  got  around  to 
          working on the newsletter generator, as I've been meaning to 
          for  awhile  now.  It  makes life a great deal easier at our 
          end.  The  changes  aren't  that  apparent  to  the  reader, 
          though.  
          
          What  readers  WILL  notice  is  that we now have a table of 
          contents.  It was suggested just recently,  and judging from 
          the flood of messages we've gotten, we gather it's something 
          you really want.  
          
          We'll need your help to do make it work.  When you submit an 
          article,  you  should put a content line at the beginning of 
          the file.  This is just an  asterisk  ("*")  followed  by  a 
          short  description  of  your  article.  Everything after the 
          asterisk will appear in the table of contents,  and  not  in 
          the article.  
          
          Your  article won't get bounced just because it doesn't have 
          a content line -- it just won't show  up  on  the  table  of 
          contents.   Unless,   of  course,  we  go  in  and  add  one 
          ourselves, about which we make no promises.  
          
          
          The other big change is that we are using ARC  to  pack  the 
          newsletter  for  mailing,  by popular demand.  We'll also be 
          making our first test mailing to the regional  coordinators.  
          If  all  goes  well,  we'll  scrap  the present distribution 
          system entirely.  
          
          Each regional  coordinator  will  be  getting  FNEWSvnn.ARC, 
          which  will  contain FIDOvnn.NWS,  where "vnn" is the volume 
          and issue number (227,  in this case).  I still  feel  funny 
          putting  just  one file in an archive,  but the fan mail has 
          convinced me.

                              Utility for Sysops
          
          I have written a small utility that has proven to be very
          useful to me as well as a few other sysops.  It's a simple
          program that renames a file to the current system date.
          
          For example, if the date were Oct. 21, 1985..., and I ran
          this program as such "CHG2DATE SYSOP.LOG" then the file
          SYSOP.LOG would be renamed to 21OCT85.LOG.  Note that the
          extension does NOT change.
          
          Now you may be saying "So what" or "Big deal", but this
          small program has come in very handy many times.  What I
          do is, every night.., one minute before midnight, I run an
          external event which changes the names of the SYSOP.LOG and
          the MAILER.LOG files.
          
          I usually let these accumulate until the end of the month
          when I combine them into an ARChive file according to the
          month, such as OCT85HIS.ARC for Octobers history.
          
          Recently, I wanted to find a person who had changed their
          name the month before and see what their name was before
          they changed it.  It was really simple using a small batch
          file that I wrote.  I just entered the paramters and used
          the DOS FIND command to search thru the files to find it,
          such as:
          
          LOOK ??OCT85.LOG "Name changed to: Bernie Lawrence"
          
          The program searched all the matching files and displayed
          the line with the name change in it.  Then all I had to do
          was to type the file that it was found in.  The LOOK.BAT
          file is very simple and only contains:
          
          ECHO OFF
          FOR %%f IN (%1) DO FIND %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9 %%f
          ECHO ON
          
          The reason for the long list of parameters is so you can
          enter up to eight words to search for.  You MUST enclose
          the string to search for within quotes!  You can also
          use the FIND programs switches such as:
          
          LOOK ??OCT85.LOG /N "Name changed to: Bernie Lawrence"
          
          This can be used for many things..., say you want to find
          out how many times Bernie Lawrence logged onto your baord
          on Oct 5, 1985.  All you would have to do is enter:
          
          LOOK 05OCT85.LOG /C "Bernie Lawrence on"
          
          and you get a count of the number of times he logged on,
          on Oct 5, 1985.  This batch will only work effectively if

          used in conjunction with the CHG2DATE.COM program, since
          this provides a way of keeping the days seperate.
          
          CHG2DATE.COM is a small program written in assembler.  It
          only takes up 698 bytes of space.  It's command format is
          simple..., you just place the name of the file to rename
          on the command line such as:
          
          CHG2DATE SYSOP.LOG
          
          The file SYSOP.LOG would be renamed, and the extension
          would remain the same.
          Note: Since the extension remains the same, rename the
          MAILER.LOG to MAILER.MAL before renaming it to avoid
          duplicate names.  Otherwise, CHG2DATE will abort with
          an error.
          
          This program, combined with the LOOK.BAT file is handy for
          looking at all the mail that was sent out during a month or
          just on a particular day.  For instance, if you wanted to
          see all the Nodes that had mail successfully sent to them
          and the days it was sent, then you could enter:
          
          LOOK 20OCT85.MAL "Yes"
          
          and a list like this would be displayed:
          
          ---------- 20OCT85.MAL
           124/11   |     1 |     1 |     0 |     0 | 00:22   Yes
           124/7    |     5 |     1 |     5 |     0 | 00:44   Yes
           124/11   |     1 |     1 |     0 |     0 | 00:19   Yes
           124/2    |     1 |     1 |     1 |     0 | 00:30   Yes
           124/7    |     1 |     1 |     1 |     0 | 00:44   Yes
           124/8    |     2 |     1 |     1 |     0 | 01:06   Yes
           124/11   |     1 |     1 |     1 |     0 | 00:27   Yes
           124/12   |     2 |     1 |     1 |     0 | 00:29   Yes
          
          Again.., you could have used ??OCT85.MAL to get a list for
          the whole month.
          
          Well.., now that I've explained a few of the benifits, let
          me explain how to set it up to run.  It's not very hard to
          implement at all.  All you have to do is set up an external
          event with a tag of X and give it the errorlevel to exit to
          DOS with. The event should be set up to last only one minute
          since that is more than enough time.  I have chosen an
          errorlevel of 20 and so I'll show you how I have my runbbs
          batch file set up.

              if errorlevel 10 goto remote
              if errorlevel 1 goto end
          :renlog
            chg2date sysop.log

            ren mailer.log mailer.mal
            chg2date mailer.mal

            runbbs
          :remote
            watchdog on
            ctty com1
            goto end
          :end
          
          
          Note: The program waitn.com is used to make the system
          wait till the entire one minute is up so that the event
          is not executed again.
          
          I hope that you will find this program of use and if you
          would like to get a copy of it, you can download it from
          my board, or from one of the other nodes in my Net.  The
          program waitn.com can also be downloaded from my board.
          
          Note: This program was written in MS-DOS on an IBM PC
          and it will work on MS-DOS machines.

          Luck Hurder
          101/105
          
                    ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
                    +The Fidogram Free Telegram Service+
                    ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
          
          The Amateur Radio operators here at 101/105 have been en-
          joying the responses to our Fidogram service that began
          last month - (see Fidonews 9/09/85). For those of you who
          didn't read it (gasp!) we'll recap briefly:
          
          1.  Personal (non-business) telegrams to anyone with a 
              telephone can now be accepted by Fido.  Free, no charge
              - gratis.
          
          2.  There's no limit to the number of Fidograms you can
              send for free, but each Fidogram must be kept rather
              short.  20-25 words seems about right.  Remember - vol-
              unteer radio operators will be delivering these for you.
          
          3.  You may not attempt delivery of any Fidogram that con-
              tains:
          
              A.  Material compensation, direct or indirect to any
                  party.
              B.  Codes or ciphers meant to disguise the true meaning
                  of the message.
              C.  Suggestive or foul language.
          
          Here's some of the typical questions we've been asked:
          
          1.  Can I send a Fidogram to my Aunt matilda in Mexico?  
              Yes, Mexico is one of the countrys whose government 
              shares an agreement with our government, allowing Fido-
              grams via Amateur Radio.  many countries in Central and
              south America have this agreement with us; most of the
              European countries do not.  Remember, however, that 
              final delivery of your message will depend entirely
              upon our locating an Amateur Radio operator within free
              calling distance of the addressee.  We recommend that
              you begin initially by sending Fidograms to more pop-
              ulated areas here in the USA...
          
          2.  Can I send "happy Thanksgiving" messages with the same
              text to 30 people in 20 different cities?  You betcha -
              we call these "book" messages - but be sure to always
              include your own complete name, address, and voice tel-
              ephone number as well as the same complete info for

          3.  How long does it take to deliver my Fidograms?  Sorry,
              that's a toughie to answer; if it's going to a place in
              New England, we'd estimate a day or two.  Other desti-
              nations in the USA should take less than 3 days.
          
          4.  Why so long?  Well now, you wouldn't be guilty of for-

              getting that this free public service requires the
              efforts of many volunteers, now would you?  Considering
              the price (you can probably squeeze one heckuva lotta
              fidograms into one piece of Fidomail!)  it's still a 
              bargain, regardless of the time element involved...
          
          The Amateur Radio operators actually appreciate the opp-
          ortunity to offer this service to Fido users.  These mess-
          ages are grist in our radio mills - ways to exercise uour
          skills and equipment.  We realize that we're likely to be 
          hit up fairly hard around the holidays and - particularly
          from college-area Fidos - during the weeks prior to Val-
          entine's day.  That's fine - overloads of message traffic
          help us to spot our weaknesses.  Feel free to try and in-
          undate us.
          
          Fidograms, as well as questions & criticisms regarding them
          can be sent to Luck Hurder at Fido 101/105.

                        ==============================
                          WE'VE CHANGED OUR NET/NODE
                            BUT NOT OUR STRUGGLE!
                         By Christopher Baker, Sysop,
                           Metro-Fire Fido, 135/14
                        ==============================
          
          
          This is just to let everyone know that Metro-Fire Fido has 
          moved to a new net/node location in your trusty nodelist.
          
          We are now part the Miami Area Network, Net 135. This too 
          is temporary, since we intend to form a Special Interest 
          Region for Fire Departments. Several departments are now 
          studying the possibilities of linking up with Fido and 
          FidoNet. As soon as one or two more come together, I will 
          be applying for a Region number assignment.
          
          You in FidoLand can continue to assist me in my endeavor 
          by passing these articles to anyone you know in any Fire 
          Department anywhere. (See also FidoNews 227 & 229.)
          
          As an update, Metro-Fire Fido now has two doctors on-line 
          for questions and answers related to EMS, Trauma Networks, 
          Hyperbaric Medicine, Diving Trauma, and General surgery 
          and other medical questions. We are looking for an Expert-
          in-Residence to take up the gauntlet of Hazardous 
          Materials, Water Rescue, Apparatus, Training, Safety, and 
          any other areas of interest to the Fire/Rescue Services.
          
          Please feel free to lend your support/assistance/expertise 
          or to contribute information to our system. Verification 
          for access to our system can be made by FidoMail or call 
          305-596-8611 and leave information to the Sysop. The board 
          runs in the private mode from 2230 Sunday til 1800 Friday 
          and in the semi-private mode from 1800 Friday til 2230 
          Sunday.
          
          If you want to communicate in writing, address your 
          questions/requests to:
                                    Sysop

                               Miami, FL  33173
          
          We'll be looking forward to your interest. Thank you.

                        BROTHER, CAN YA SPARE THE TIME?
          
                             by Ben Baker, 100/76
          
               Hey  look  people,  I'm  the guy who started this whole
          daylight saving time controversy  in  a  phone  conversation
          with  Thom  H.  and I can't believe EVERYBODY has missed the
          point completely!!!
          
               We have a time period we  call  "The  National  FidoNet
          Mail  Window."  Now,  I don't care if your clock reads 15:23
          when it begins, so long as your schedule says "begin mail at
          15:23!"  Do  with  your  clocks  what  you will, but I think
          you'll agree that we all have to start the "National Window"
          together more or less.
          
               We  call  it  the  "National  Window"  and its time was
          selected because the whole nation can make  calls  when  the
          rates are lowest.  Right?  -- WRONG!
          
               One  whole  state is so far west that in the winter its
          "National Window" starts at 11pm.  Well, it's early OK,  but
          they still get the cheap rates.  Right?  -- WRONG AGAIN!
          
               They  are  also so far south that they get more or less
          twelve hours of daylight all the time, so they don't  bother
          with  daylight  savings  time.   So  when we push our clocks
          forward in the Spring, we push their "National Window"  back
          to 10pm and there went the cheap rates.
          
               I  speak, of course, of Hawaii.  (Alaska probably would
          have a similar problem, but we don't have any Fido nodes  up
          there. . .yet.)
          
               So,  what  I suggested, for this reason alone, was that
          when  we  get  the  "National  Window"  back  to  0900   hrs
          Coordinated  Universal  Time  next  week,  we keep it there.
          Then the entire nation would have access to the cheap  rates
          most of us enjoy year 'round.
          
               And you can set your clock any way you like!

          Cincinnati, Ohio
          
          Help!?  Are there any Fido software collectors out there?  
          due to modem incompatibilities with the later versions of 
          Fido, I am forced to use an older version (10e, gadzooks!).  
          That's no big problem, but I would like to have all the 
          software I need to set this up. I do have almost all of the 
          necessary files but one: ROUTE.EXE. Soooo, that's what I 
          need!  Is there anyone out there with an old ROUTE.EXE 
          program floating around on a floppy somewhere? Ifso, a reply 
          would be great! I'm kinda in need, so any information would 
          help! Just send me a reply to Matt Carpenter (me) at Fido 
          108/10, Allen's Board.  
          
          Also, is Charles H. Downs out there? Leave me a FidoNet msg 
          I need to contact you! (if any of you know him, relay this 
          please, if possible) 
          
          Help, anyone?
