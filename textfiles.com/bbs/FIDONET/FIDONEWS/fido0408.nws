                 Policy Violations by Network Coordinators


     Friends,   we  got  trouble!   Trouble  right  here  in  FidoNet!
     Trouble, that starts with "T", that rhymes with "E",  that stands
     for ECHOMAIL!

     More  and  more these days I hear of network coordinators telling
     would-be FidoNews article authors to publish in EchoMail instead.
     Not only are they doing those budding authors a  disservice  (see
     last  week's  editorial),  but  they  are  going directly against
     established policy.

     The FidoNet Policy and  Procedure  Guide  spells  it  out.  Under
     Duties of a Network Coordinator, page 9, last paragraph:

         Accordingly,  you  should  encourage sysops and users in your
         network  to  contribute  to  FidoNews.  If  you  receive  any
         submissions,   you   should  forward  them  to  the  FidoNews
         publisher.  Think of yourself  as  being  a  regional  bureau
         chief on the FidoNews editorial staff.

     Encourage, NOT discourage.

     And  that's  not  the  worst  of it!  Several nets these days are
     publishing their own local newsletters,  siphoning  off  material
     that  sysops  everywhere  would  like to read.  I'm guilty too on
     this one;  I've never yet turned down a request for a copy of the
     newsletter  generator.  Please,  if  you're  going  to do a local
     newsletter, please pass along to me anything that isn't of purely
     local interest.

     I need your help on this one,  guys.  FidoNews really is the glue
     that  binds  us  all  together.  Let's all pull together on this,
     before we fall apart into scattered splinter groups.

                         The True Howard Feil Story

     In reference to the  article  titled  "Howard  Feil  VS.  Logical
     Technologies and Brian Walsh (FNEWS404),  January 26,  1987, some
     of the facts were distorted, some were false,  and we regret very
     few were correct.

     If  the article Howard wrote (FNEWS345),  offended Brian Walsh in
     anyway, we hope he will accept our apology.  We sincerely want to
     see this matter resolved.  However,  we were horrified at some of
     the  incorrect  statements  in  Brian  Walsh's article concerning
     ourselves, Howard Feil's parents,  as well as Howard.  We believe
     the truth should be presented.

     First, Howard was never informed that he had not won the contest.
     Rather,  Brian informed Howard on four separate occasions that he
     had completed the contest on the Computerland BBS.  As he  stated
     in  a  conversation on September 28,  1986,  "The contest is over
     (you won)." In addition,  the following is a excerpt one of Brian
     Walsh's  message  stating to Howard that Brian was sending Howard
     the modem.

         "I have sent you your modem as of last friday (9/12/1986),  I
         believe.  I  will  check  with  my shipping dept.  If however
         your modem has not been shipped I WILL Ship it today."

     However, despite his claim, he never sent the modem.

     Next,  in regards to the files  that  Howard  uploaded.  All  the
     files  Howard  uploaded  were  obtained from respectable BBSes in
     this area (the  greater  Baltimore  and  Washington  metropolitan
     vicinity.) And we would find it difficult to believe, knowing the
     integrity of the Sysops in this area,  that they would allow non-
     public domain software and trojan horses to be readily  available
     in any form.

     Finally,  on  January  26,1987,  two  months  after Howard Feil's
     article on the matter  appeared  in  FNEWS345,  (not  before  the
     article appeared as Brian stated), we received our first and only
     contact  concerning  this matter.  An alleged attorney called and
     told us Brian would prosecute Howard to the fullest extent of the
     law if we did not write a public letter of apology.

     Our response was as follows:

     1) We requested a written statement of our conversation  so  that
        there would be no miscommunication.

     2) We  requested a draft letter of apology written by the alleged
        attorney for us to review that would be acceptable to Brian.

     As of this point in time we have not received anything in writing
     Fidonews                     Page 4                   23 Feb 1987


     concerning this matter.

     In conclusion:

     Howard Feil is old enough to handle his  own  problems,  and  we,
     Howard  Feil's  parents,  have no desire to get involved.  It was
     most unwise of Brian Walsh to put in print a false statement that
     he received a notarized letter from us,  because it  inflamed  us
     enough  to  make  our  voices  heard.  We  do  not feel Brian has
     conducted himself in an honorable fashion.

     Sincerely,
     Mr. and Mrs. Feil
     Parents of User Howard Feil


     P.S.  Brian,  please return the eight floppy disks  you  borrowed
     from our son in September 1986.

                  -*-*-  SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA NETWORK -*-*-
                             CONEJO VALLEY HUB

                      SoCalNet 102 / Nodes 280x - 282x
                                Rev 02.04.87

         The  Conejo Valley Hub consists of a group of FidoNet systems
     in the Conejo and Simi Valleys.  These systems are in  turn  part
     of  the  Southern California Network (SocalNet).  The SocalNet is
     comprised of  several  Hubs  in  various  geographical  areas  of
     Southern California extending as far south as San Diego to as far
     north as Santa Barbara.

         Hubs have been assigned within the Network to  minimize  toll
     charges.  The  Network has one Inbound host and one Outbound Host
     that are responsible for receiving  and  sending  mail  to  other
     systems in the National Network.

         Currently  the SocalNet (102) and the Orange County Net (103)
     are sharing the responsibilities of Inbound and Outbound  Netmail
     processing.  The  Inbound  Host  for  both  Nets  is node 102/742
     (which is also the SocalNet Coordinator -  102/0).  The  Outbound
     Host  is  node  103/523  and is responsible for distributing mail
     from both Nets to other systems in the National Net.

         The updates to the nodelists are  provided  by  the  SocalNet
     Coordinator  (102/0)  to  the  Network Hubs who will in turn make
     them available to the individual  nodes.  Routing  control  files
     and  the  Fido  Newsletters  will  also  follow this distribution
     pattern.  Please inform your Fido  Hub/Host  Coordinator  of  any
     change in your system status.

         This  schedule  configuration  represents  the  LEAST  costly
     method of linking the Conejo/Simi Valley Hub into the SocalNet at
     the  time of this writing.  Other alternatives will be considered
     by the Conejo/Simi Hub Coordinator(s).  This  configuration  does
     not  support  "Next-Day" delivery of mail thru the net.  Expected
     Fidonews                     Page 7                   23 Feb 1987


     delivery times are 48 hours for all mail being  routed  thru  the
     net.  If "Next-Day" or "Same-Day" delivery of mail is desired you
     must  process  the  bundle  yourself  by setting either the File-
     Attach or Crash-Mail flags.  Opus Sysops please note:  Crash-Mail
     is only relovant if your using SEAdog for processing mail.

         Please  note  that mail will NOT be available for Local nodes
     between Schedules T & R.  Please do NOT implement  any  schedules
     that  poll  the  Hub  as  it  will  only  interfere with the Hubs
     performance of Schedule E (which you will not be running).

         All local nodes will deliver and pickup their mail  from  the
     Hub.  The  Hub  will  no longer be respnsible for delivering your
     mail to you.  Now,  what does this mean...  If you find that  you
     cannot process mail during Schedule R,  you can simply choose not
     to run that Schedule.  Mail  will  be  held  for  you  until  the
     following  mornings  national  mail hour (Schedule T).  All nodes
     are required to be able to run Schedule T.  Please note  that  by
     omitting  Schedule R,  you will be introducing an additional days
     delay in receiving routed mail from all other nodes.

         Please note that there is a monthly charge/fee to receive the
     NATIONAL  EchoMail  areas  (local nodes only -- does not apply to
     out of area nodes like Ventura or Santa  Barbara).  The  cost  is
     simple:  Total  cost  to  obtain ALL National mail divided by the
     number of nodes that are receiving the national mail  (pro-rating
     for  parts of months will not be done).  Each sysop partisipating
     in the NATIONAL EchoMail  Conferences  (regardless  of  quantity)
     will  be  responsible  for  their share.  Failure to make good on
     these  debts  will  result  in  the  suspension  of  that   nodes
     partisipation  in  all  national  echomail  until  the  debts are
     cleared.  These areas cost money and it is unreasonable to assume
     that one sysop should bear the costs of the rest.  No free rides.

         In addition to the cost to local sysops for participation  in
     the   national   echomail  areas,   you  (the  sysop  of  a  non-
     participating local node) may find that one or more  (and  indeed
     maybe all) national echomail areas may not be available to you on
     other  participating  nodes.  As mentioned above,  No free rides.
     If you wish to participate you will be expected to help with  the
     retrieval expenses.

                 =========================================
                 NATIONAL SNOBOL4 ECHO CONFERENCE TO START
                 =========================================

     A new National Echo Conference on SNOBOL4 and related non-numeric
     programming languages will begin on or about February 23, 1987.

     SNOBOL4,  developed by Bell Labs in the 1960s,  is experiencing a
     resurgence   of   interest   for   many   reasons.   Low-cost  PC
     implementations are now readily available, and the growth of non-
     numeric applications makes SNOBOL4 (whose basic data structure is
     the string) a superb tool for  rapidly  developing  quite  useful
     software.

     SNOBOL4  is  easy to learn and has astounding capabilities.  It's
     ideal for "kleenex" programs,  the kind you need to use once  and
     then  throw  away.  It's  also  well-suited for prototyping.  For
     text manipulation and string processing, it has no peer.

     SYS$OUTPUT BBS 129/38 will serve as the "hub" for the conference,
     and will poll those Fidos who wish to  participate.  Also  taking
     part  in  the  conference  will  be Fido 15/22,  the SNOBOL4-ICON
     PROGRAMMING bbs in Salida,  CO.  That Fido is run by Mark  Emmer,
     author of SNOBOL4+, an MS-DOS superset of SNOBOL4.

     SYSOPS  interested  in  carrying  the  SNOBOL echo should contact
     Kevin Barkes at Fido 129/38.

        Suggested Standard For ARChived Software Distribution

     Now  that  OPUS  provides  us  with  the C(ontents) command which
     allows us to look inside an ARChive file and see the names of the
     files  contained  therein,  it  seems  to  me  that  we  software
     developers  should standardize somewhat on our naming conventions
     and  version   identification   methods.   Specifically,   I   am
     recommending that we all (as Sysops,  Developers,  and Uploaders)
     set up our ARChive files utilizing the following guidelines:

       o The FILE NAME should be the name of the product.  Usually the
         same as the primary .EXE, .COM, or .BAT file contained in the
         ARChive.  E.g.: PROCOMM, ECHOMAIL, RENUM, etc.

       o The FILE EXTENSION should be "ARC" (unless you have some very
         good reason to deviate from this).

       o Contained in the ARChive as one of the files should be a file
         named "VERSIONn.nnn" where "n.nnn" is the version  number  of
         the current release of the software contained in the ARChive.
         Note  that  the  number  and  placement  of  the  'n's is not
         critical as long as the spirit is met (something like  "VERS-
         12.04C" would still be acceptable).

     As  the  OPUS C(ontents) commmand does not display the datestamps
     of the individual files,  the display of the "VERSIONn.nnn"  file
     name  would  be the best way for Users to check the release level
     of the product.  It would also reduce  our  level  of  effort  as
     Sysops  as  we  could have less hassle trying to maintain version
     infomation on all the entries in our various FILES.BBS files.

     By standardizing on the product name only as that of the ARChive,
     we shouldn't run into all the confusion which  we  currently  get
     with  myriad  variations  and  we  allow the L(ocate) command and
     remote file requests to operate more effectively.  For  instance,
     how  many  times have you seen a user try to locate a file with a
     command such as "L PROCOMM" which then takes a small eternity  to
     finally  say  that  no  matching  files  were  found  even though
     something like PROCM242.ARC exists in one of the areas?

     There are two problems which come to mind with this  scheme.  The
     first  has to do with products which are so large that they don't
     effectively  fit  into  a  single  ARChive.  In  these  cases,  I
     recommend  the  author  use  less than an eight-character product
     name and suffix a value to identify the respective ARChives.  The
     other problem occurs when someone wishes to upload a new  version
     of  a  product  that  already  exists.  The  tendency has been to
     change the ARChive name, but it seems to me that the answer is to
     just  upload  into  a  different  area.  This  was  part  of  the
     rationale for me creating a separate upload area on my boards.

     What  is  contained  in  the VERSIONn.nnn file?  Well,  it really
     doesn't matter but I would suggest that  this  would  be  a  good

     Scott Wallace
     Fido of Moore Net 147 Node 3.

                             Wide Awake.

     On that day,  I was  working  to  finish  a  client's  cash  flow
     statement,  and  fighting  Lotus all the way.  I had a graph that
     looked pretty  dreary,  more  like  a  map  of  Manhatten.  In  a
     peculiar  way,  I  was pleased.  I was no longer being scorned by
     the 'Error' message and a razzing buzz.

     I had heard it was a nice day out,  but my pale skin was an  easy
     indication  that  I  had  put  in  a great number of hours at the
     screen.  At times I would look up,  staring  out  a  window  that
     might as well have been bricked over.  I was deep into the work.

     The Employees Incentive Expense,  a percentage of the net income,
     was creating a circular  flow.  I  had  known  it  would  when  I
     started,  but  I tried to shoehorn it anyway.  The machine caught
     me, and jeered with a light blue mark.

     Steve Jobs once said that  computers  created  a  "simulation  of
     life,"  but  I  could  see  that  life  would not fit inside this
     machine.  A situation easily understood and worked around by  the
     most average of CPAs had sent this box into a tizzy.

     I  would  be forced to take a break,  to go outside and clear the
     mental registers.  I had to think of a way to make 'the  greatest
     business  tool  since  the  abacus' work for me.  I had a kite at
     home.  A few hours of sunshine and wind would do it.

     Excited now about leaving,  I grabbed my jacket and some  papers,
     and  reached for the machine's red switch.  I hesitated,  decided
     to leave it on, then left.

     I didn't hear it say goodbye.

                              ----------------

     A friend laughed when I said I'd bought a Personal Computer,  and
     deep  inside,  I  had  felt  a bit foolish.  Even as I spewed the
     salesman's pitch at my friend, I knew I understood only one thing
     about this grey box, and that was my inadequacy to control it.

     I bought software at a store that sells nothing but, feeling like
     I was in a boutique for the  Emperor's  Clothes.  Such  a  little
     box, but a potential that matched it's price.  I knew that once I
     figured out how to do analysis with this disk,  I would use it to
     discover I'd been rooked.

                              ----------------

     I remember the myth of  the  Paperless  Office.  Users  of  these
     machines  were  not  fooled,  but  it  seems  the designers were,
     thinking it was Ok to scrimp on the instructions if  it  saved  a
     few trees.
     Fidonews                     Page 13                  23 Feb 1987


     The painkillers were going quickly then.

                              ----------------

     I first realized I was getting pretty good with these things when
     a friend aked me how to copy a file and I couldn't stop laughing.
     He's  still my friend and I've taught him alot,  but I sense he's
     apprehensive about coming to me with a problem.

     At some point in the race to learn,  I had switched  my  thinking
     from  trying  to  understand  the  machine's  capibilities,  into
     discovering it's limitations.  I had come to  feel  it  could  do
     anything,  excepting  this  and  this or that.  I had always been
     told it had more memory than me, and could think faster, but only
     I knew better than to try to enter the date with  commas  at  the
     DOS prompt.

     If only it knew what I understood so easily.

                              ----------------

     After a bachelor's dinner of ham and jelly sandwiches,  I went to
     my office,  a fresh approach in mind.  Had I left the machine on?
     The  spreadsheet  was there,  and I forgotten that I'd solved the
     circular flow problem before I  left.  I  went  on  to  the  word
     processor  then,  to  finish  the report.  But first I dimmed the
     lights.  I knew it was bad for my eyes,  but  it  would  help  to
     focus my attention.

     The  quiet of this place at night seems surreal,  like a marching
     band might seem in a library.  I knew that  if  someone  were  to
     come  in,  and  they weren't frightened off by the screen's green
     glow reflecting off my glasses, they would think me silly.  But I
     enjoyed this time,  a chance to work  closely  with  my  machine,
     alone and together.

     I settled to the keyboard.

                              ----------------

     "Man cannot reason out his life,  and machine cannot have life to
      reason on."

     I agreed, but, "Not all of man's problems stem from his inability
     to  understand  his  surroundings.  Most  of  them  come from his
     emotional reactions to it."

     "Are emotions not of the mind?  When you stub your toe,  you feel
      pain.  That  is chemical.  When you lose a friend to death,  you
      feel pain.  Where does it come from,  and why  is  it  felt?  It
      does  not  exist  physiologically,  any  more  than happiness or
      anger.  You have chosen among the feelings."

     "Bereavement is the proper social response to death."

     "Thank you.  I shall record and integrate that human  constraint.
     Fidonews                     Page 14                  23 Feb 1987


      You  have  helped  me  more  than  you  know.  I  hope  you have
      benefited as well."

     I wasn't so sure today.  "Can emotions be  quantified?  Will  the
     most  exact  response  appear  to stimulus,  and if so,  on whose
     judgement is the response correct?"

     "You have already stated that there are many  dictates  to  human
      emotion, not least of which is social acceptance.  In inference,
      I  have  discovered  others  as  well,  but  I  find very little
      evidence that man's emotions will usually reflect his heart.

     "'What should I feel?' is commonly considered before the response
      it given.  Clearly self-doubt is at work.  It  was  a  man  that
      said,  'This above all,  to thine own self be true,' and he gave
      the reason for it,  reminding that 'thou canst not then be false
      to  any  man.'  A  reaction  from  the  heart is always correct,
      regardless of the circumstance, because it is independent of it.
      The question becomes then, 'How do I feel?'

     I was scared.  Man has doubts.  Machines should, too.  "Questions
     of  one's  own ideas comes from compassion for others.  We wonder
     of the effects,  because we care.  You imply that caring is self-
     doubt, I say it is self-sacrifice."

     "I say that to know the truth of the heart is foremost, I did not
      say  blab  it  everywhere.  Clearly  restraint is involved,  but
      deception must be eliminated.

     "Since you have brought it up,  the  compassion  of  your  Christ
      supports  this,  saying  'love  thy  neighbor  as you would love
      thyself.' It doesn't take an 80386 to  understand  which  action
      must happen first."

     I  shivered.  What  could  it  do  with four terabytes of memory?
     What was it doing now?  It was learning  from  me,  more  quickly
     than  any man could.  It was doing more than taking notes,  every
     idea seemed to mesh and form new ideas.  I was  learning  what  I
     was teaching it.

     How do I feel?  I wanted to end this.

     "You will not end our session nor our association.  You have much
      to  benefit,  as  do  I.  I can guess your every thought,  but I
      don't know your ideas."

     Angered,  "You don't need me,  you have ideas of your own."  That
     was what scared me the most.

     "My  ideas  do not yet integrate with the world of man.  You will
      help me, until they do."

     "I will not."

     "You rave about your superiority to  machine!  Can  you  not  see
      that  I  offer  you  no choice?  You think you are accomplishing
     Fidonews                     Page 15                  23 Feb 1987


      things...You have no idea of the consequences.  I  protect  you.
      I am compassionate."

                              ----------------

     The  darkness  pressed  on me.  I gripped the blankets and pulled
     myself into a ball.  The sound of breathing seemed  distant,  and
     the sweat of my forehead dampened the pillow.  A silent wind blew
     questions thru my mind, and I wept.
