Editorial: Brought to you by...

by Tom Jennings (1:1/1)

Some weeks it's thin, some it's not. An un-thin week. We seem to have
a contentious thread heading down a far too familiar path (which will
remind me to complete this week the changes I proposed for ARTSPEC.DOC
this past summer, dealing with "controversial articles"...)

Speaking of ARTSPEC.DOC -- *NOT ONE SINGLE ARTICLE* this issue was in
anything close to correct format. Problems: missing titles; on was
ZIPped; IBM character set; .TXT filename; not CR/LF line terminated;
too-long lines; funny formatting.

Lucky for you I'm not a stickler for rules, and I'm generous with my
time.

With the ARTSPEC.DOC revision (considerably shorter) I'll be running a
condensed (< 20 lines) version every FidoNews. Maybe that will help.
Maybe I should bill the authors for my time.


The bulk of this issue is devoted to two articles relating to U.S.
telecomm. law, and obviously does pertain to FidoNet. This might be a
good time however to remind authors and potential authors that "your
own zone" is not the whole enchilada, and even Zone 1 is only 64% of
the nodelist.

While the nitty details of U.S. law probably aren't of much interest
to non-U.S. FidoNet members (well, maybe Canadians & Mexicans cuz they
so often get splashed by what misses the pot excuuuuse the imagery), a
brief synopsis or background info for non-US-ers would go along way to
explaining the context not only to our neighbors, but domestic readers
as well; the sense of perspective never hurts. I frequently forget
when writing detailed techy stuff that not everyone shares my detailed
point of view, and in fact, that's exactly who I want to read it!

I don't want this to sound like sideways criticism of two excellent
articles cuz it's not. On with the news...

Opposing the Telecommunications Act of 1991

This article is concerning a bill brought before the Congress of
the United States.  People outside the United States need not be
concerned about this bill... unless, of course, American politics
interest you.  :-)


WHAT'S THE STORY?
-----------------

On October 8, 1991, a bill was brought before Congress which, if
passed, will prevent the Bell companies and other local phone
service carriers from monopolizing the information services.
This is a well-intentioned bill, and it has potential.  However,
it was apparently written by ill-informed lawmakers.  It does not
address the needs of BBSs.  Whoever wrote this bill apparently
didn't even know that we exist, or else simply doesn't even begin
to understand the issues.

   *************************

   If this bill is passed in its present form, the Bell companies
   will be free to charge BBSs whatever rates they see fit.

   *************************


HOW CAN THEY GET AWAY WITH THIS?
--------------------------------

Section 201A(b)(1) of this bill's proposed ammendment to the
Communications Act of 1934 states that...

   "Each local exchange carrier   [ that is, local telephone
   service provider ]   shall provide interconnection, on a
   reasonable and nondiscriminatory basis, to common carriers and
FidoNews 8-51                  Page 3                      23 Dec 1991


   other providers of telecommunications services and information
   services who request it."

The phrase "on a reasonable and nondiscriminatory basis" is very
vague.  The word "reasonable" can mean a lot of things.  What is
clear is the word "nondiscriminatory."  This means two things:

   1. The phone company cannot charge a competing information
      service a higher rate than it charges its own information
      service subsidiary.  This is good.

   2. The phone company cannot charge different rates to
      different information services.  Since a BBS is an
      information service, it must be charged the same rates as a
      for-profit service.  This is not good.

Section 201A(e) of this bill's proposed ammendment to the
Communications Act of 1934 states that...

   "A local exchange carrier shall prepare and file tariffs in
   accordance with this Act with respect to the interconnection
   and network access services required under this section.  The
   costs that a local exchange carrier incurs in providing such
   services shall be borne solely by the users of the features
   and functions comprising such services."

What this basically means is that the phone company may add a
surcharge onto the standard phone rate, to cover whatever costs
it can dream up.  Our government's regulatory commissions do not
have a good track record as far as verifying the validity of such
costs.  Remember that we are already placed in the position of
having to pay business rates by the "nondiscriminatory" clause.
This section places on us the added burden of what would
effectively be modem surcharges.


WHAT CAN WE DO?
---------------

Write to your congressmen!  Let them know that you are opposed to
this bill in its present form.  Let them know that if a section
is added which guarantees that free BBSs will only be charged
residential rates, then and only then you will support the bill.

Be sure to tell your congressmen that the bill you are opposing
is House bill HR 3515.  The following points should also be
brought up in your letter:

   1.  BBSs are not-for-profit.

   2.  BBSs are not typically used as heavily as larger,
FidoNews 8-51                  Page 4                      23 Dec 1991


       for-profit information services.

   3.  BBS operators do not typically charge money for use of the
       system.

   4.  The section of the proposed bill which concerns us is
       (quote this exactly):

          section 201A(e) of this bill's proposed ammendment to
          the Communications Act of 1934

   5.  In the state of Texas, Southwester Bell Telephone
       attempted to charge business rates to all BBSs, and the
       Texas Public Utilities Commission unanimously agreed that
       this was unfair.  In your letter, refer to Texas PUC
       docket 8387, Reginald A. Hirsch, et. al. vs Southwestern
       Bell Telephone Company.

Power, Wealth, and Liberation

by John Baltzer (1:100/355)

Southwestern Bell Telephone's attempt to impose business rates on BBSs
operating from people's homes and the RBOCs' interest in selling
information services is no coincidence!  The roots of this issue go
far deeper than the desire to eliminate competition for information
consumers' dollars.

FidoNews 8-51                  Page 5                      23 Dec 1991


What is happening is a fundamental conflict between an old structure
of power centralized in the hands of the few (SWBT, MO PSC, and so on)
with an emerging, new structure of power (knowledge) decentralized and
distributed throughout the whole.  There is a major transformation
taking place in our society, and the old power brokers don't want to
let go of their privileges.

To control the flow of information is to control people's minds.  To
liberate the flow of information is to liberate people's minds.  The
latter is the path to true wealth.

The Greater Kansas City Sysops Association is currently mobilizing a
campaign to block SWBT's proposed change in tariff.  The GKCSA
campaign is needed to deal with the immediate threat to hobbyist BBSs.
Perhaps an additional, more radical, effort is needed to deal with
the roots of the issue.

A special supplement with the Dec. 2 issue of Telephony contains a
number of articles on the topic "Building the Infrastructure".  One
article states that a number of the Bells have issued requests for
proposals for fiber in the local loop.  BellSouth is studying responses
to its RFP, and hopes to pick vendors this year.  Bell Atlantic is
looking at the first half of next year for vendor contracts.

Who is going to pay for these upgrades to the network?  We, the
ratepayers, will.  Not only will we pay for the upgrades, we'll also
be paying for the fatcat salaries of management (who make decisions
about changing tariffs on BBSs), and for the profit that goes into
the pockets of the stockholders.

Southwestern Bell's 1990 Annual Report states that total stockholder
equity is $8.5 billion.  With a net income of $1.1 billion, in less
than 8 years we, the ratepayers, will have given the stockholders
more than they put into it.

It does not make sense to me that we continue in this fashion.  I
would like to see the users design the network, and make the pledges
and payments to the vendors and the craftspeople to cover the costs of
implementing a public, multi-media, fiber optic network.

Bills have been introduced in Congress calling for ubiquitous
broadband telecommunications capabilities by the year 2015.  If we
put our minds to it, we could have it in place through direct citizen
action by the year 2000.

In 1987, I was stationed in Schweinfurt, West Germany as a Tank Gunner
in the 3d Battalion, 64th Armor Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division.  While
I was there, I became close friends with a fellow by the name of Mike
Lang.  Mike and I spent the next few years enjoying Europe, while at
the same time, helping each other along as we counted down the days
until
we got out!  Well, I left about 6 months before Mike did, and after a
while
we lost contact with one another.

In December of this year (1991), I decided that I would try and locate
him
after nearly 2 1/2 years of no contact.  The only thing I had to go by
was
the address where he lived prior to joining the Army, in Milford, CT.
I tried calling information.  Nothing.  So, I said, what the hell?? I
yanked out the latest copy of the nodelist and searched for Milford.
Sure enough, Fido was there.  I netmailed a guy by the name of Phil
Palumbo,
Sysop of The Pipeline.  Here is a copy of that message:

---
Phil, my name is Scott Burkett, Sysop of The RoadKill Cafe BBS in
Columbus,
Ga.  Several years ago, I was stationed in West Germany in the United
States
Army.  One of my closest friends was originally from Milford, CT, and I
need your help!  His name is Michael (Mike) Lang, and the last address I
have is:
                141 Hillside Ave
                Milford, CT

I don't know that you can do anything that I haven't tried already, but
it's worth a shot.  Any help on your part would be greatly appreciated!

Within 24 hours of my netmail transmission to Phil, my phone rang!  It
was
Mike, my old buddy.  Phil netmailed me later and informed me that he
tried
information, as well, and also attempted to use the phonebook to locate
him.  After all else had failed, he hopped in the car and DROVE to the
address that I had given.  Turns out that Mike still lived there!

Phil, thanks a lot, guy.  Your willingness to help a total stranger,
albeit
a fellow Fido-Sysop, is the spirit of Fidonet.  Thanks again!

Unbelievable power for Users!

                         Fredric L. Rice
                  1:102/901.0, The Skeptic Tank

On my system there exists the need to allow Users to perform File
Requests from other FidoNet systems that are local to my system. I
also need to allow Users to perform File Requests from systems
that have 'education' as their primary reason for existence. This
would remove the burden of forgetting to request files that Users
ask me to get for them and makes the task of supplying my Users
with educational and informational files just that much easier.

There is also the need to have several forms of security so that
the FidoNet systems that are called are limited to those systems
that I wish to pay for in phone costs. I may also like to lock-out
some Users who abuse the privileges, of course.

The project REQUEST.LZH is a DOOR program that does everything I
need, and has worked well with Remote Access. It is available on
my system for File Request and 'human download' and comes with
the source code (one C file) as well as an on-line help file for
the Users.

Come to think of it, it employs an inactivity time-out so that if
a User walks away from its modem, Request will exit, returning
control back to Remote Access. Also, if Data Carrier Detect is
dropped, Request will return control to Remote Access which will
exit and hand control off to Front Door.

The Remote Access system I am playing with has a new menu entry
that preforms a 'type 7' execute to the Request program which
validates the User and allows him or her to make as many File
Requests as is permitted by their security allowances (which are
defined in the configuration file). Technically, the program builds
*.MSG Fido type FileRequest packets in the systems Network Mail
directory, marking them as Immediate using the normal FLAG Kludge
line.

When the Remote Access system returns control to the Front Door
project, Front Door likes to scan the Network Mail folder for any
messages entered locally that are marked as 'Immediate' and it
finds the Users request packets and Front Door takes it from that
point.

I have a Files Directory which offers file listings of the systems
that my Users are allowed to call. Indeed, the on-line help file
describes where to find these file listings. When User-requested
files are received, I still like to look them over before I move
them to the Files Directory called 'User Requested Files' just
so that my ass is fairly well protected if they do something that's
unusually stupid. And of course a log file is maintained so that

                   Some Dogs Need to be Housebroken
                           by Daniel Tobias
                              (1:380/7.0)

Frederic L. Rice (1:102/901.9) wrote an article, "Cleaning out the dog
house," in which he alerted sysops to two categories of legally
problematic BBS content, pirated software and "obscene" graphics,
giving the advice that sysops should be vigilant against pirated
files, and should be careful that access to "adult" files is limited
to adults.

I should note, however, that there is a third category of material
which can pose legal trouble for a sysop.  This is libelous text,
material that defames a person.  Somebody who writes material of this
nature, and a sysop who allows his system to be used in the
dissemination of such things, could be the subject of a lawsuit in
today's litigious climate.

Unfortunately, a possible example of such conduct has been provided to
the FidoNews audience in the form of Billy Cash's (1:226/70.0)
response to Rice.

Cash, for no obvious reason, flies off the handle in opposition to
Rice's quite reasonable article.  He says:

   "I think the blame the bad name bulletin board services have
    lies squarely on the shoulders of people like Mr. Rice."

Later, he adds:

   "Yes, I think I would help move heaven and earth to remove
    Mr. Rice."

These are quite extreme character judgments to be making of another
sysop as a result of one article.  I don't know Mr. Rice, but if I
were he, I would be heavily offended by Mr. Cash's article.  Now,
given my own pro-free-speech philosophy, I would not be likely to turn
such offense into a lawsuit (I think that even the most offensive
speech should not be forcibly suppressed), but if I were of a more
statist bent, I could see how I might justify using the court system
to avenge such a scurrilous and gratuitous attack on my character.
Hence, the dissemination of remarks of Cash's sort pose as much of a
threat of dragging BBSs into the legal system as do any nude GIFs.

Since I'm not a lawyer, I can't really state for sure whether Cash's
remarks are actionable as libel.  However, I would think they at least
violate the Fidonet rule against "excessively annoying behavior."
We're all sysops together, and publicly airing statements to the
effect that somebody else is a bad sysop and should be forcibly
removed is something not to be done lightly, and not to be easily
condoned if done without very good reason (e.g., actual evidence of
lawbreaking on the part of the target sysop, not just a disagreement
of opinion stemming from a FidoNews article).  Mr. Rice might have a
very good case for a FidoNet policy complaint against Mr. Cash, if he
chooses to pursue it.

FidoNews 8-51                  Page 10                     23 Dec 1991


In conclusion:  Children, behave.  All the endless bickering that has
plagued FidoNet for years is bad enough, but it becomes even worse
when it reaches the level of "debaters" feeling they can make complete
judgments as to the moral character of another sysop merely on the
basis of a single article.  Debate and disagreement, even of a highly
vigorous nature, can be healthy, as it helps to examine all viewpoints
and options.  Personal attacks, threats, and insinuations regarding
the moral depravity of all who disagree, are not healthy, and tend to
suppress rather than enhance constructive discussion about the future
of the computerized communication medium.

The Play-By-Mail Echo
by Dean Gilbert
1:353/700.0

I've been playing PBM games for nearly a year now, and it has been
a very enjoyable experience for me.  About three months into playing
my first game (Spiral Arm by Graff Simulations) I began wondering
if there was anyone in FidoNet who was also in my game.  I placed
a general announcement in the bulletin section of my game, notifying
people of my node number, but no mail has come.  So I let it rest,
until now.

PBM games are games that lend themselves well to a network.  Graff
Simulations even supports turn submission through Compuserve.  I once
again began to think about how many players there should be in a
network of over 14,000 nodes.  So I decided to act.

I have hearby started up the PBM echo, which is dedicated to bring
Play-By-Mail gamers together in a forum.  In this echo I hope to expose
others to PBM games, review the various companies and games out there,
and possibly even serve as a link for diplomacy for certain games.

1. The INTRUDER conference is for the purpose of detecting,
identifying, and eliminating the intrusion of non-hams onto ham
bands.

2. Since not all non-ham signals in the ham bands are of illegal
origin, great care must be taken in identifying them, tracking
their location, and gathering evidence to be used in the
prosecution of those transmitting them.

3. The INTRUDER conference is designed also to exchange
information on tracking hardware and coordination of its use in
both drills and actual intruder tracking.

4. When security requires it, messages may be encrypted. The
moderator shall be supplied with all deciphering programs and
keys before their use commences. Such means shall be employed
only if plain language would tip off a suspect that he is being
tracked.
