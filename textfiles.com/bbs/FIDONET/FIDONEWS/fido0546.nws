     =================================================================

                          IMPORTANT NEWS ITEM!!!!

     I am  going to  be upgrading 1:157/504 to multiline over the next
     few weeks. Since 1:157/504 is also 1:1/1, this  will be  of major
     significance to everyone who file requests FidoNews from me. I am
     currently running TBBS 2.0S (Single  line)  and  am  going  to be
     upgrading to  TBBS 2.1M  (Multi line) in order to help satisfy my
     user base. File requests will  only  be  accepted  from  one hour
     before National  Mail Hour  to one  hour after National Mail Hour
     (08:00-10:00 GMT).

     The standard  distribution chain  on FidoNews  is that  I send it
     directly  to  the  Regional  Coordinators.  The  RCs then forward
     FidoNews to the  NCs,  who  distribute  it  to  their  own nodes.
     FidoNews should  reach the RC's no later than the end of National
     Mail Hour. FidoNews is  also  sent  to  1:1/0,  the international
     coordinator.

     If you are interested in obtaining the absolute latest edition of
     FidoNews direct, your best bet is to file  request it  just after
     National Mail  Hour on  Monday morning. It will also be available
     for downloading on 1:157/504  as soon  as it  comes back  up from
     mail processing (around 10:15 GMT).

     While I  regret the  inconvenience this will cause some of you, I
     have to put my users first in this matter.

     Thank you for your consideration in this matter.

                       A Study of NetMail Traffic
                              David Schuetz
                              1:109/716.101

          Hello.

          I am a Junior Computer Science major at the University
     of Maryland.  I am currently working on a proposal/study to
     develop the most effective routing for national and, if the
     method developed is transferrable, international net mail
     traffic.  "Most effective" means "least cost and minimal
     hassle to the end user." My ultimate goal is to propose a
     simple method of routing that will be incorporated into
     general FidoNet policy, or, at the least, generally accepted
     by all for the good of all, much as our efficient EchoMail
     distribution system had developed.  This system, ideally, will
     allow anyone in the nation to enter a message to anywhere
     else, without needing to establish credit with the Sysop of
     the originating board, and to be able to have it on good faith
     that the message will arrive within a reasonable period of
     time.

          In order to proceed with my study, I need to know as much
     as possible about net traffic in FidoNet.  For this reason,
     I would like you to answer these questions and send me a
     response at 1:109/716, as soon as possible.  The survey is
     intended to give me an idea of how much NetMail traffic is
     actually *out there*, how much there *could be* (if the method
     for sending mail were a bit easier), and what most people seem
     to think the best method for moving this mail is.

          Thank you very much for your cooperation.

          Sincerely,

          David Schuetz

          (301) 454-3787 (dorm hall phone, leave message)
     P.S. I have no connection with IFNA.  I am not even currently
          running a board.  This really is being done for a class.
          If the results to my study are promising, then not only
          will I have completed a class requirement, but FidoNet
          as a whole may benefit.

     ----------------------------------------
     What is your....
     1)  ...Node address?
     2)  ...Modem speed?

     FidoNews 5-46                Page 3                   14 Nov 1988


     3)  Do you have Continuous Mail capability?

     4)  Do you use PC-Pursuit, Reach Out America, or a similar
         long distance plan?

     5)  Do you or your company "eat the cost" of long distance
         calls?

     6)  What is your typical number of net-mail messages over a
         given period of time? (see also #10)
     7)  How many of these are within your local net?
     8)  Within your zone, but outside your net?
     9)  Outside your zone?
     10) What period of time is this data based on (day, week, month)?

     11) How do you route Net-mail?

     12) How does your net handle net-mail?
     13) Echomail?

     14) Do you have an outbound host?
     15) An inbound host?
     16) Do they have backups?

     17) Do you have any objections to a routing standard being
         dictated to the net if it would mean minimum cost to a
         maximum number of users?

     18) Do you have any suggestions as to how, if at all,
         Net-Mail routing could be improved?

     19) What would you be willing to do to improve routing? (Cost
         eating, high-speed links, dedicated mail node, etc...)

     20) How, in your opinion, *should* (ideally) Net-Mail traffic
         work?

     Any other comments:

     ----------------------------------------

          Results of this study will be posted in FidoNews, and
     should appear in late December/early January.

          Again, thank you very much for all your help, it is much
     appreciated.

     Don Dawson
     OPUS 141/730

                         I finally get 'em right!

             Subtitle: I love those utilities, but.........!

     Have you ever noticed that most of those neat utilities that
     you use to keep OPUS humming along seem to require a
     control file of some kind?  And often the control file requires
     some information that's spread across your hard disk in some
     other control file that's used with some other program, maybe
     even a file that OPUS uses.  Maybe one day, all of the utility
     program authors will be able to agree on ONE PLACE to put all
     the information that these programs need.  But until they do,
     enter........

                   Area Manager by Tom Kashuba (167/1)

     Kash, as he's called by many, has created a dandy little program
     that actually creates all those little pesky control files.
     Yup, his program requires a control file too, but the
     information you put in it is used to build the control files
     used by those neat utilities.  Sound like a ho-hummer?  Read
     on.

     When you last added a new echomail area did you remember all
     the control files into which it had to be added?..starting with
     the ECHO.CTL file, maybe an AREAS.BBS, then the control file
     that your message reader uses and RASMAM and RENUM, and, and...
     the list goes on.  Of course, I could never get every file
     correct and EXACTLY as they needed to be for each.  Some of
     them use the Area number, some use the Area Name, some need the
     complete path.

     Well, with AM (Area Manager) you build a control file that has
     all of this information in it, then, using powerful commands
     that Kash has built into AM, it will generate all of those
     pesky control files. AM will even put them on the correct
     disk drive into the correct directory.

     If you haven't tried it, you should....it's a another fine
     piece of programming by the author of OOPS and others.  It's
     File Requestable from 141/730, 24hrs as: AM_102.ARC...just in
     case a newer version shows up here before you do...you might
     want to file request AM_*.ARC

     One last comment....Kash asks that after you try it, if you
     continue to use it, that you register it.  The price is small
     but the value is BIG!

                           Take an Echo Breather
                               Glen Jackson
                             REC for Region 14.

     or...slow down the eyestrain when reading echomail!

     I finally installed a larger drive, so I felt I was deserving
     of a few more echos to read. I've changed my mind.

     I'd like everyone to know that this article is not written in
     ANY kind of "official" capacity, but merely my own observations.

     Things that aggravate me in echomail:

     1. Questions like "where can I get that whatever.arc" ?

        These questions get answered by multitudes. If it is a
        piece of network software, I have a solution to keep the
        message flow down:

        a. read the origin line, and do a file request.
        b. look in your nodelist for your closest Software
           Distribution node.
        c. check in your net to see if someone else has it.
        d. as a last resort, netmail the author, and ask him about it.

     2. Answering Twits in echomail. Someone posts a message that says
        something like "I think so and so's mother wears army boots".

        We are then subjected to many messages that look like this:

       TWIT> I think so and so's mother wears army boots.
       TWIT>
       TWIT> * origin The Twit calls here (nnn/nnn)

        Hey TWIT! who let THIS guy on??????

       Again, I have some helpful hints:

       a. ignore him.
       b. net-mail the sysop of the originating system and complain.
          (if the guy is out of line)

     3. Help! What init string do I use for the goofyblatz modem with
        Binkley? Again, the question may have been answered many times
        before. We all want to be helpful, but...

        Would it be out of line for the moderator to step in and say,
        "This has been discussed before". Here is what we came up
        with. (Don't flog me, please. I see a moderator as one that
        keeps track of what goes on with his conference.)

        If the moderator can't help, open it up for everyone.

     4. Finally, 7 screens (on one message), from one person, repeated
        by however many people he has decided to answer. Clear cut
     FidoNews 5-46                Page 6                   14 Nov 1988


        answers can usually be taken care of in a few sentences. And
        to all of you others out there that can't stand this, why not
        send the guy a netmail message with your complaint?

        I don't like to have to keep hitting the [N]ext key whenever I
        see a message by a certain author. Those messages cost SOMEONE
        (or maybe lots of someones) money to send. If you feel the
        need to write a book, either:

        a. send it via netmail on your nickle, or
        b. write an article for Fido_news.

     I did. :-)

                             Why me, Goddess?

                               David Rice
                             (1:103/503.0)


          I'm guilty.   I  freely  admit  the fact.  I deserve to
     hang, and to be left swinging from the highest  spreader  on
     the ship.  Yep!    Guilty:  That's me.  Let me begin at the,
     er, beginning, and you'll agree, too.

          I run an Astrology BBS,  with  it's  related  astrology
     files,  message base STARGAZE Echo, and I provide answers to
     astrology students free of any and all charges, if they have
     the courage to ask (as if the question is not  well  thought
     out  I  can  be somewhat acerbic with the replies), and if I
     know the answers.

          I therefore get more than my share of,  shall  we  say,
     interesting callers.    I  get  (and  don't  really welcome)
     threats, demands, offers, and law suits  thrown  at  me  for
     being "that  Godless  pagan SysOp."  As astrologers are used
     to being considered somewhat, well, odd, this  is  not  very
     annoying.

          Until one  day.  My brother in Christ who was assigned,
     presumably, to "monitor" my BBS, often calls once a week  to
     screen  capture  the user list, check out the new subversive
     material (files) available, and hang up. (I  say  "hang  up"
     and  not "log off," as that's exactly what he does.) One may
     only guess at what he plans on  doing  with  my  BBS's  user
     list, but visions of Jihad come to mind. . . .

          But I  digress.    Until one day, I continue, I got the
     Holy Bible from a very kind SysOp in San Jose, and posted it
     available for downloading.  The Holy righteousness  hit  the
     fan.

          Answering  an  incessant  YELL from a user, I was asked
     (well, demanded seems to fit better): "Isn't this a New  Age
     Board!"

          I answered  truthfully. "No, it is not.  If it was 'New
     Age' I would have charged you $5.00 a minute for  the  first
     ten  minutes,  and  $2.50  for each additional minute, and a
     dime for each character I'm typing at you now."  As  we  all
     know, the only thing that "New Age" is good for is to make a
     great deal of money from ignorant fools.

          "Yes  it  is!" the reply came back. "What's the Word of
     God doing on a Satanist's BBS!"

          Hummm.  Why me, Goddess?  I thought.  I don't eat  Your
     animals.  I don't drink, smoke, or screw.  I'm a good witch.
     Why, then,  pick  on  me?   The best answer I could think of
     came to me, then, like a revelation, like  a  prophecy.
     FidoNews 5-46                Page 8                   14 Nov 1988


          "Because  my  Witch's  Coven  in  San  Diego has subtly
     altered it  in  misleading,  deceiving  ways,  to  trap  the
     innocent, and to further our own, evil, unguessed of ends."

          I don't much like being called a "Satanist."

          Click! the  modem  went. "Caller Vanished!"  OPUS went.
     "Sigh," I went.

          So you see, I am guilty.   I  didn't  expect  any  more
     trouble after that, but I suppose I should have.

          Two   weeks   later,   someone   was   yelling   at  me
     unremittingly again.  It was a new caller, and being a  nice
     guy I answered the yell.

          "GO VOICE!" it  demanded.  Sure, I thought, why not?  I
     picked up my phone, and typed: "Pick up your phone  and  log
     off."

          "Hi," I said cheerfully, in my best SysOply voice. "How
     may I  serve  you?"   Six words, but he only waiting for the
     first three before ranting:

          "Take the Bible off your BBS!" He raved.  I  envisioned
     some   short,   scrawny   twit  spitting  in  his  receiver,
     acne-scared  of  face,  wearing   a   ratty  sweater  over a
     Perma-Press  dackron  shirt,  and three sets of underwear in
     case of an "accident."

          "Ahumm, what?"  I am slow at times.   He  repeated  the
     demand, and added for my enlightenment:

          "You  can't  have  astrology and The Word of God on the
     same BBS!" He said "astrology"  like  you  or  I  might  say
     "Richard Nixon" or "Jane Fonda."

          Many  years  ago  I  learned  the art of Not Listening.
     Most American kids learn this by age  14,  taught  by  their
     parents when they rail against them.  One learns to just say
     "Uhm,  yes"  and  "Uhm,  no" now and then (it doesn't matter
     which), to appear that one is listening.

          He started on a long, drawn-out,  dry,  rambling  spill
     that  seemed to begin nowhere, and seemed just as endless as
     his capacity for ignorance.

          "Uhm, yes," I said over to the phone.  I paused.  "Uhm,
     no,"  I  added  next.   After the witnessing was over, I was
     shocked to find he  was  waiting  for  my  reply.    Gee,  I
     wondered, what did he said?  I only heard the first demand.

          "Sure, I'll delete  those  files.  Anything else?"  And
     off he went again.  He mentioned something about killing the
     STARGAZE echo and all my astrology programs before  I  tuned
     him out again.

          "Uhm, yes. . .  Uhm, no. . .  Uhm, yes. . . ."

          He finally hung up after assuring me that he would pray
     for my soul.

          The  next  day  I added three more Bible related files,
     and an area of "Christian" related text files.  Gee, I  hope
     he doesn't mind.

          The whole  point of this sad story?  Well, I mistreated
     a user, slapping  him  silly  with  my  prankish  wit,  just
     because he was ignorant enough to call me a "Satanist."  And
     he really  didn't  deserve  it.    So It's my fault, and I'm
     guilty as, er, Hell, and I'm real sorry.

          I have since disabled the YELL option of OPUS for those
     under PRIVILEGE level.  This  isn't  fair  to  other  NORMAL
     level users, but some had to die.

     Editor
     FidoNews

     "Letters to the Editor"

     Sir:

     I am attaching selected items from both the Articles of
     Association and the By-Laws of The International FidoNet
     Association which were filed with the State of Missouri
     for the expressed purpose of Incorporating the entity known
     as IFNA.

     I am providing a edited version of these documents along with
     comments on each so that I can support the claims that I have
     or will be making in this letter:

     Excepts from:
                       ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION
                               for the
                  INTERNATIONAL FIDONET ASSOCIATION

     Be it known that we, the suscribers, do hereby associate
     ourselves as a body politic and corporate pursuant to the
     statute laws of the State of Missouri regulating the
     formation and organization of corporations without capital
     stock and the following are our Articles of Association:

        I. The name of our corporation shall be the International
             [Text deleted for Space Reasons]

       II. The period of duration of the corporation is perpetual.

      III. The address of its initial Registered Office in the State
      of Missouri is: 120 S. Central, Suite 1400, St. Louis, Missouri
           [Text deleted for Space Reasons]

       IV. The purposes for which our corporation is formed are the
           following:

           A) the promotion of interest in telecommunications and
              experimentation;
              Comment:   Ok, if this is true, then why are Networks
                         other than FidoNet excluded from the
                         promotion of Telecommunications and
                         experimentation?  Why are there limits
                         placed upon other International Networks
                         who wish to communicate with FidoNet?

           B) the establishment of telecommunication networks to
            provide publicly accessable and publicly available
            electronic communications;

              Comment:   Is this true in today's environment?  Can it
                         be that a person holding a position of
                         authority within IFNA's structure is denying
                         access and electronic communications?  I
                         think someone should look at this one real
                         close!

           C) the furtherance of the public welfare;

              Comment:   Keeping people from diverse backgrounds from
                         free and easy access to the IFNA regulated
                         Nodelist (via Zone Gates) is not in the
                         interest of "public welfare" in my eyes.

           D) the advancement of telecommunications art the fostering
           of education in the field of electronic communication;
           E) the promotion and conduct of research and development
            to further the development of electronic communication;

              Comment:   This is the one which really gets me, you
                         expect a lot when IFNA does not even live up
                         to the "promotion" of Inter-Network
                         development.  Promotion and development
                         occur when two parties (ne Networks) try
                         to develop a new technology when the old
                         one doesn't fit any more.  To establish a
                         link and then take it away, because of a
                         non-delivered piece of paper is really
                         pushing it to the maximum.

           F) the dissemination of technical, educational, and
      scientific information relating to electronic communication;
           G) the printing and publishing of documents, books,
     magazines, newspapers and pamphlets necessary or incidental to
     any of the above purposes.
           H) No part of the assets or income of our corporation
     shall inure to the benefit of or be distributable to the
     members, the officers, or any of them, or to other private
     persons except that our corporation shall be authorized and
              empowered to pay reasonable compensation for services
              rendered and to make payments and distributions in
              furtherance of the purposes set forth herein.

        V. The affairs of the Corporation shall be governed by a
     Board consisting of Directors as defined in the By-Laws.
     Each Director shall be elected for terms of two years by the
           members eligible to vote.  Half of the Directors shall be
           elected for terms beginning on even numbered years and
     half shall be elected for terms beginning on odd-numbered years.
            [Text Deleted for space concerns]

       VI. During the intervals between meetings of the Board of
           Directors, the affairs of the Corporation shall be
           administered by an Executive Committee consisting of the
           [Text deleted for Space]

      VII. A vacancy in the Board of Directors shall be deemed to
     occur upon the death, resignation, recall, move of permanent
           [Text Deleted for Space]

     VIII. The officers of the Corporation shall be a President, a
     Vice President, Vice President - Technical Coordinator, a
           Secretary, and a Treasurer, who shall be elected by a
           majority of the Directors at the Annual Meeting.

           Comment:    What No International Coordination positon
                       defined within the limits of the Articles?

       IX. These articles may be amended by the three-fourths vote of
           all directors, or, provided due notice of the proposed
           amendment shall have been sent to each director at least
           thirty days in advance, by a two-thirds vote of all
           directors.

        X. The membership of IFNA shall consist members as defined in
           [Text deleted for Space]

       XI. No person shall be eligible to serve in any of the
           positions or offices of Director, Alternate, President,
     Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, or Vice President -
     Technical Coordinator, whose service in any such capacity would:
              A. Violate any applicable law, statute, ruling or
                regulation of the State of Missouri or the United
                States  of America, or of the country of domicile of
                such person; or
              B. Jeopardize the non-profit or tax-exempt status of
               IFNA, as defined by the laws, statutes, rulings or
               regulations of the  State of Missouri or the United
               States of America; or

              Comment:    Are  not, given the above items, the actions
                           of Mr. David Dodell, about to jeapardize
                           the Non-Profit/Tax-Exempt status of IFNA?
                           This providing that the above points are
                           intrepreted to mean that David's actions
                           are not in the best interest of IFNA and
                           the IRS's view on furthuring public
                           interest/telecommunications on an
                           international basis.  (AlterNet is an
                           international fraternal organization)
                           incorporated in the State of Delaware.

              C. Amount to, create or continue a conflict of interest
      between the activities, aims or purposes of IFNA and such
     person's private financial interests or such interests of any
     of such person's employer, family or relations.
     Each person nominated or elected
                [Text deleted for space]

       Comment:    Has Mr. Dodell obtained the BOD's permission
                   to react the way that he has?  Since the BOD has
                   not attempted to either restrain Mr. Dodell in the
     FidoNews 5-46                Page 13                  14 Nov 1988


                   performance of his duties (which are not defined in
                   the By-Laws) does this mean that the BOD approves
                   of his actions?  Does his attitude and apparent
                   disregard for agreements constitute a conflict of
                   interest when considering the purpose of IFNA and
                   IFNA's stated aims and Activities?


      XII. Upon the dissolution of our corporation, the Board of
           Directors shall, after paying or making provision for the
           payment of all of the liabilities of our corporation,

     The following from:

                               BY-LAWS
                               for the
                  INTERNATIONAL FIDONET ASSOCIATION

     DEFINITIONS:

     The following terms have meanings as follows for all
     purposes of these By-Laws and Articles of Association:

     IFNA: International FidoNet Association.

     IFNA NETWORK: The current set of systems which have been
     certified as FidoNet compatible and conform to policies
     established by the Board of Directors.

     Comment:  Alternate Networks have met and continued to
               remain within the operating invironment of
               FidoNet compatible, and for the most part
               have taken the Network Accepted Policy3.doc
               as the basis for their own networks.  This
               being a given, then Alternate networks should
               not be withheld from Zone Gating.  There are
               after all only 7 Major Continents and I believe
               that the software currently provides for up to
               13 Zones.

     IFNA NODELIST: The list of nodes active in the IFNA NETWORK,
     prepared by the IFNA Vice President - Technical Coordinator.

     Comment:  The IFNA Vice President - Technical Coordinator does
               not produce the IFNA Nodelist, David Dodell does not
               hold this position although at one time he did hold
               the position within IFNA.  At FidoCon '88, Ray Gwinn
               gave the position of International Coordinator to
               Mr. Dodell.


     PUBLIC ACCESS: A system that has a telephone number
     FidoNews 5-46                Page 14                  14 Nov 1988


     published in the IFNA Nodelist, and in addition provides
     services to the public.

     ANNUAL MEETING: A yearly meeting of all members of IFNA with
     [Text deleted]

            also satisfying the requirements to be a Regular Member
            shall be entitled to vote.

         d) Honorary Member.  The Board of Directors may award
            Honorary Member status to any entity.  Honorary Members
            have all of the rights of a Regular Member except the
            right to vote.

         e) Life Member.  Any member may become a Life Member by
            paying the required dues.


      7. No person shall be an officer or director unless they

     29. The Vice President - Technical Coordinator shall:
         a) be responsible for maintenance and distribution of the
            master NODELIST;

            Comment:
            Ok, please inform me as to why the IC's position is
            still being held by Mr. Dodell and why it is not a
            part of Mr. Gwinn's job.  Additionally, Mr. Gwinn is
            not provided with the power to delegate his authority
            on this one to anyone.

         b) creation and distribution of the weekly update file for
            the master NODELIST;

            See comment above.

     FidoNews 5-46                Page 15                  14 Nov 1988


            prescribed by the Board of Directors;
         d) serve as a member of the Technical Standards Committee.

     30. Standing committees:
         a) The following standing committees are established:
            -  Administration and Finance
            -  Executive Committee
            -  Nominations and Elections
            -  By-Laws and Rules
            -  Technical Standards
            -  Publications
            -  International Affairs
            -  Membership Services
         b) Each standing committee shall include among its members at
            least one director. Additionally, the Treasurer shall
            serve as a member of the Administration and Finance
            Committee. Appointments of all standing committee members
            shall be made by the President at the Annual Meeting and
            shall be for a term of one year.  The Chair of the Board
            shall designate the chair of each committee.  Standing
            committees shall make written reports at least 30 days
            prior to each regular meeting of the Board of Directors.
            Standing committees may originate studies in their fields
            and may generate recommendations to the Board on their
            own initiative.

     36. The Technical Standards Committee shall be responsible for:
         a) Providing a rigorous definition of FidoNet and all FidoNet
            protocols sufficient to implement a compatible electronic
            mail system.
         b) Providing IFNA the means to determine whether a system is
            compatible with FidoNet.  This will allow IFNA to list
            compatible systems so Sysops may decide which system to
            install.
         c) Producing and enhancing standards for:
            -  Data Transmitted
            -  Connection
            -  Protocols
            -  Nodelist
            -  Routing

         Comment:   From this one, since the SysOps in the Alternate
                    networks are using much the same software as is
                    being used by the SysOps of FidoNet/IFNA Network
                    there should be no "Technical" reasons for not
                    allowing Zone Gates into the IFNA/FidoNet
                    Nodelist.  In fact, the Alternate networks have
                    kept the same schedules for a "Common" Mail Hour
                    a "Common" Nodelist Format, a "Common" policy
                    complaint handling procedure, a "Common"
                    technical Standard for protocols and have gone
                    to the trouble of "Dual Identies" in order to
                    maintain a close relationship with the people
                    they know and wish to communicate with within
                    the FidoNet Network.

     37. The International Affairs Committee shall monitor the
         conduct of international liaison by IFNA staff.  They shall
         initiate recommendations for IFNA representation at
         international meetings.  They shall encourage the growth and
         strengthening of IFNA, its member societies and
         telecommunications worldwide. They shall coordinate and
         monitor planning and strategy for improving international
         telecommunications.

         Comment:   IFNA's International Affairs Committee is charged
                    with the "of telecommunications worldwide", the
                    last time I looked at a map, the United States,
                    Canada, Europe, Australia, Asia and Africa were
                    still part of the world.  Therefore, are not
                    networks which are located anywhere in the world
                    something which IFNA should be working in a
                    positive manner to promote connectivity with?

     I appologize for the length of this article, but hope that it
     will be printed (which I will be surprized if it is), as the
     reader will note, IFNA appears free to augment the positions
     which it is chartered to have at the drop of the hat.  It also
     appears as though they are willing to forsake some of their
     own By-Laws and Articles of Association to get things done the
     way that they want them done.  They also have people who
     delegate job functions as they see fit without regard for the
     fact that they are still responsible for the actions of someone
     who is in the delegated job function.

     If you intrepret what I have written to be a slam at IFNA, it
     is just that.  IFNA is supposed to promote communications on an
     International basis, they are not doing that, they are busy
     playing games with the United Nations, which is not all bad, but
     they are unwilling to deal with Alternative Networks within
     Zone 1, so why would a "Reasonable Person" believe that they
     would treat a network from Siberia any differently?

     Many of you know me, I was a FidoNet Sysop for over four years,
     having joined FidoNet just after the mighty Multi-Net
     implementation.  I have served IFNA and FidoNet in many job
     functions, I wanted (initially) to see IFNA succeed.  I spent
     my own money to go to New Hamster to help the committee
     understand exactly what a "Grunt Sysop" wanted from them.  I
     have seen the By-Laws read the way that people wanted them
     read, namely to the benifit of those currently in power.  I
     have also seen many changes in attitude especially from those
     who were elected by the people in IFNA to rule over FidoNet.
     I have seen you the people who make up FidoNet, let it be
     taken over by a few of the "Elected Representatives" of the
     people who paid $25.00 to join IFNA.  I have been known to
     look for Cemetary Plots all over the place,  I am not saying
     FidoNews 5-46                Page 17                  14 Nov 1988


     that this is a Plot, I am saying that the IC is the VP-TC and
     that the person "Elected" to that position was not elected by
     the people who elected their representatives.

     Many who will read this, will say that I am simply speaking
     "Sour Grapes", but take a look at what has happened since
     FidoCon'87, the Network has grown by over 150%, IFNA
     membership is still less than 10% of the total Network, the
     attempts of the people who grew tired of the garbage which
     IFNA was attempting to push down their throats and left
     to form their own Networks are not sour grapes.  At this time
     the Alternate networks have a total membership which is equal
     to or slightly greater than the network when I joined it.
     The Alternate Networks have taken the things that worked from
     FidoNet, the RC structure, the Policy Documents, the Dictator
     style of management and created something which works.  They
     have applied for Zone Gate Numbers following prescribed
     procedures, namely asking for one, and were told "NO".  How
     do you think that the United States was formed, just by the
     same type of actions by England!

     There is a revolution, now that the die has been cast, as to
     which network(s) will be the one to win is unclear, but in
     one corner you have FidoNet, represented by IFNA, which is
     supposed to be a democracy telling the Alternate Networks
     you have to be so large and in place for so long etc..  In
     the other corners are the people within the Alternative
     networks who don't need an organization to speak for them,
     and who for the most part use to want to see IFNA succeed.
     If they have lost faith in IFNA/FidoNet then what do you think
     is going to happen after all the "Zone Wars"?  In general, the
     whole idea that Tom Jennings started with Fido/FidoNet is going
     to disappear.

     Edward Hawes
     Fast-BBS

     I wanted to let all sysops know about our new CHESSLINE
     system available for bbs operations.  The ChessLine will give
     your BBS that extra feature which will attract the kind of users
     you want.  Do you ever get tired of seeing users call in, skim
     the message base, then go to the files section?  The ChessLine
     makes your board more interesting by giving them something else
     to do.  Chess has been around for centuries, and unlike other
     past times, has not been harmed by the computer age.  In fact,
     have you ever noticed that of the people you know who are
     interested in computers, probably more of them play chess than do
     not?  While the game does not require a genius to play, it does
     attract people who are at least interested in exercising their
     intellectual dexterity.  This is a prerequisite to personal
     computing and goes hand in hand with the users of a bulletin
     board system.

     The ChessLine operates in a fashion similar to 'postal chess'. A
     user will call your BBS, enter The ChessLine, make his move, and
     exit.  His opponent will call later, enter The ChessLine, make
     his move, and then exit.  What makes The ChessLine more
     interesting than postal chess is that you don't have to wait on
     the US mail.  The ChessLine will store all moves and when your
     user calls, will set up an on-screen chessboard with the last
     played position shown.  All moves entered are checked for their
     legality, as The ChessLine will permit no illegal moves.  All
     legal moves including castling, enpassents, and pawn promotions
     are allowed.  The ChessLine will terminate the game as soon as
     one player check-mates the other or if the game becomes
     stalemated or a player resigns.

     We have also added some other options to Chesline for you and
     your users enjoyment :
     1.. The ability to leave short comments to the other player
     2.. Sysop chat mode (with auto word-wrap)
     3.. Sysop online play with user
     4.. Netmail play (see Netmail doc's)
     5.. List of all moves
     6.. The ability to take back moves
     7.. View other games in progress
     8.. Online Help

     FUTURE ADDITIONS (Already under developement)
     1.. U.S. CHESS Federation ranking system..
     2.. Node to Node interactive play..

     CLMAIL.EXE
     This utility is the most exciting aspect of Chesline.. Clmail is
     the Net-mail utility that will send moves to any board
     in the E-Mail Network that has ChessLine installed.
     Let me explain. You see Clmail creates a outbound
     message with the record enclosed.. So if you wanted to play a
     game with a user in Washington D.C.,you make your move and clmail
     will send it across the wire to the Node in Washington then the
     FidoNews 5-46                Page 19                  14 Nov 1988


     move applied to chesline on that board.. The next day the user in
     Washington would send his move to your board through Clmail
     and so on and so on... Now that i have you confuzed
     lets make it worse... Say you have 20 games going on and
     3 of them are network games to 3 different nodes,
     Clmail will automatically create the outbound messages with the
     node numbers there going to. (Have I got your attention?)
     This is a great concept because you can now play National Chess
     without having to call another board with procomm or whatever
     and sign on and go through lond distance networks just to
     make a move.. Now with CLmail you make all your moves
     locally and your mail system handles the rest..(NEAT HUH?)
     We are presently working on a player list utility that will list
     all Chessline players nationally and rank them according to
     U.S. Chess Federation rules and regulations then create a
     listing that will be distributed to all Chesline nodes so the
     users can select by player and ranking!! (Exciting HUH?)
     Well Im sure you can see how this could grow into a Chess Net!
     We are very excited about the possibilities this could bring...
     The program Clmail was written by James Brown at Brown BBS in
     Houston. Many Thanks to his hard work and dedication to the
     expansion of Chesline and the idea for the Net-Mail application.
     This concept has broken new ground in the E-mail Network and
     blazed a new path for bbs games..
                 THANKS James Brown.. WE APPRECIATE THE WORK!!

     ATTN: This program is still being tested and has not been
           distributed yet.. The netmail system will be sent to
           you free of charge if you purchase chesline...

     Notes:

     Chesline is a very high quality program designed with the sysop
     in mind.  It is written in assembler and uses ansi graphics for
     the display.  It also uses RAM for file processing so the speed
     is kept to a maximum.  It monitors the carrier and has it's own
     ansi interpreter so you don't have to load ansi.sys and you can
     still see everything on your screen that the user sees. It will
     allow a max of 200 games and is set up to run under multiple
     nodes. It will automatically get the user's name and will run at
     2400/1200/300 even 9600 baud. Thise version will have the
     ability  for the sysop to play online with user and has a
     chat mode as well.

     This program was specifically designed for opus but will run
     on PCBoard,Quik-BBS,GTPowercomm,RBBS.

                IMPROVE YOUR PROGRAMS WITH NAMED NOTATION


     In the article  "THE VERY BEST PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE " in FidoNews
     533 (15 August 1988), I said that Ada has new features, not found
     in earlier languages, that make programs easier to understand.  I
     also said that I'd try to give examples in future articles.

     When the first high-level programming language (Fortran)  was in-
     vented in the 1950's, computer time was expensive and programming
     time was relatively cheap.   Therefore,  early languages were de-
     signed to generate code that's as efficient as possible,  even at
     the expense of program readability.   Today  the situation is re-
     versed.   Computer time is cheap,  but program maintenance is ex-
     pensive.   (Program  maintenance refers to debugging,  as well as
     making changes to the software and adding enhancements.)   There-
     fore,  the most important consideration today is to make programs
     as easy to understand as possible.  Thanks to modern software en-
     gineering,  we've learned to improve program readability  without
     sacrificing efficiency.

     One of the  language  features  new to Ada makes calls to subpro-
     grams (procedures and functions) much easier to understand, with-
     out affecting efficiency.  It's called  NAMED  NOTATION  or NAMED
     PARAMETER  ASSOCIATION.   Suppose,  for example,  that we write a
     procedure (or "subroutine")  that computes the volume and surface
     area of a cylinder,  given its radius and height.   In  Ada,  the
     procedure specification might look like this:

       procedure COMPUTE_VOL_AND_AREA(RADIUS, HEIGHT : in FLOAT;
                                      VOLUME, AREA   : out FLOAT);

     Note that the procedure  specification  tells us the names of the
     parameters (or "dummy arguments"),  their types, and their modes.
     The mode can be "in," "out," or "in out."   In this example,  all
     four parameters are of type FLOAT.  RADIUS and HEIGHT are of mode
     "in," while VOLUME and AREA are of mode "out."

     Except for specifying the modes explicitly, Ada subprogram speci-
     fications aren't much different from other languages.   For exam-
     ple,  in Fortran the first line of a  subroutine,  similar to our
     Ada procedure specification, might be:

              SUBROUTINE VAREA(RADIUS, HEIGHT, VOLUME, AREA)

     Here the subroutine name,  VAREA,  is a bit cryptic, but standard
     Fortran limits us to names of at most six characters.  (Many ver-
     sions of Fortran allow names longer than the standard.)   In Ada,
     the names are limited only by the  maximum length of a line,  and
     all characters of a name are significant.

     The real advantage of Ada can be seen in the  CALL to the subpro-
     FidoNews 5-46                Page 22                  14 Nov 1988


     gram, rather than in the subprogram specification.   In all other
     languages, the names of the subprogram parameters  (or "dummy ar-
     guments") aren't known in the calling program.   For example,  in
     Fortran, a call might be

                       CALL VAREA(1.5, 3.7, VOL, A)

     This is called POSITIONAL NOTATION,  because the arguments in the
     call must appear in the same order as they do in the  subprogram,
     and there's no  reference  to the names of the dummy arguments in
     the call.  When the call occurs in this example, 1.5 in the call-
     ing program is associated with RADIUS in the subprogram, 3.7 with
     HEIGHT,  VOL with VOLUME,  and A with AREA.   This association is
     done by position.

     We can use positional notation in Ada, too.   In Ada  (as in Pas-
     cal) the word  CALL is omitted and we simply name the subprogram,
     but the call otherwise looks about the same as in Fortran:

                 COMPUTE_VOL_AND_AREA(1.5, 3.7, VOL, A);

     However, in Ada the call can be made much easier to read by using
     NAMED NOTATION:

            COMPUTE_VOL_AND_AREA(RADIUS => 1.5, HEIGHT => 3.7,
                                 VOLUME => VOL, AREA => A);

     The symbol => is read "arrow," and the name of the dummy argument
     precedes it.   With  Named  Notation,  the reader doesn't have to
     keep flipping  between the page containing the call  and the page
     containing the subprogram specification  to understand what's go-
     ing  on.   Also,  the  programmer  need not remember the order in
     which the arguments appear,  because with Named Notation, the ar-
     guments in the call may appear in any order:

            COMPUTE_VOL_AND_AREA(HEIGHT => 3.7, RADIUS => 1.5,
                                 AREA => A, VOLUME => VOL);

     As you can see,  Named Notation is one feature of Ada that really
     improves program  readability.   In future articles,  we'll cover
     other Ada features that will improve your programs.  For example,
     closely related to Named Notation are  Default Parameters,  which
     we'll discuss next time.

     If you're not programming in Ada, learn the language and go first
     class!  There are now several inexpensive Ada compilers available
     for the PC.  And I've written a  Shareware  Interactive Ada Tutor
     program ADA-TUTR.ARC, available on 363/6.   FidoNews 533 contains
     a list of many other boards that  also  have  ADA-TUTR.ARC.   The
     Tutor  stresses  good  program  design,  not just syntax, so that
     you'll learn to take advantage of the special  language  features
     new to Ada.  As always, I welcome your comments and suggestions.

     Joe Taibi
     FidoNet 280/302



                    Reach out and FLAME someone?



      You know the symptoms as well as the multitude of causes behind
     the obvious loss of focus evident in our echo areas.  Sadly
     enough it does not seem there's much likelyhood of things
     becoming any better in the near future unless something positive
     is undertaken to achieve such a goal.  There are a wealth of
     moderations and coordinations and watchdog efforts being made
     and I feel it time to at least state my own simple case
     regarding the effectivity of this approach.

     The eventual outcome that can be expected from a moderators
     efforts to control the behavior of so many individuals in the
     situation as it stands today,  is burn out,  or worse,  the same
     irresponsible insensitive behavior that they are in the position
     of policing. This is in no way to be interpreted as an attack on
     any of these individuals, it is just an observation and an
     opinion as is the remainder of this note.

     What is needed is a movement lead by those who are already
     practicing a common sense method of control and have all along.
     We must effect a shift towards a more reasonable approach to the
     problem.  I am quite certain that there are a great many users
     and sysops alike who are already practicing this very method of
     control and I take heart in the unsung and unrewarded efforts of
     these individuals for they are the reason that FidoNet does not
     collapse in a fit of childishness.

     The method of which I babble, is the only one that ever actually
     works! It is called " SELF " control. It is patently obvious to
     any casual observer that we in Fidonet hold our individuality and
     freedom to do our own thing in high regard. It is not however, a
     reciprocal arrangement by any stretch of the imagination. What do
     I mean by this? Glad you asked! I only mean that while we are so
     quick to jump up and down at every hint of an attempt to curb the
     childish inappropriate and just plain ignorant misuse of echomail
     through moderation and such, we are slow to do anything in the
     way of suggesting alternative actions!

     The part that I am truly amazed at is the majority of those who
     abuse echomail are the system operators themselves and not the
     users! So we have people who try to do something about it and
     they are met with screams and howls from every corner of the
     globe.  I know that I am merely mirroring the disgust felt by
     the majority of those in the Network who wake up daily and sit
     bleary eyed at the monitor with mouth agape at the wonderously
     idiotic verbeage that spews forth from nearly every echo and I'm
     hoping we can try to educate the responsible <?> parties.
     The abuses are far too common and all too often perpetrated by
     FidoNews 5-46                Page 24                  14 Nov 1988


     the very people who are most aware of the infractions. The vast
     majority are directly attributable to hasty responses. This is
     a demonstration of a lack of self control. I fear it is also
     indicative of the state of affairs in society as a whole.
     It is not necessary to irritate others in order to be an
     individual, and adhering to 'mandates of consideration' is not
     a loss of freedom. In point of fact it is one of the only ways
     to preserve it. Use it or lose it also relates to CONTROL!

     So from those of us who practice self control at least most of
     the time ( we all have our moments ) here are a few helpful ways
     to detect an attack of inappropri-echo-itis or in-flame-o-gramia
     idiosys...

     You should log off and get some fresh air if at any time you find
     yourself typing these words in a message:

        " This type of message does not belong in this area "

     Or words to that affect, yes there are a myriad of variations...
     Please note, this includes all moderators and coordinators etc.
     Your control, as necessary as it has become, should be visible
     within your given area only to the extent that there are regular
     postings of policy or normal related Q&A. There is no excuse
     whatsoever for anyone to use an echo to respond to an improperly
     posted message no matter what the intent. Anyone who does so is
     as guilty of the infraction as the person to whom they are
     responding.

      I know I am not alone in being absolutely sick of reading the
     unending debates over the applicability of a thread to a message
     base but let's be calm and think about it a little before
     reacting.  Then react in a manner such that your need to
     communicate does not cost anyone else!  Granted there are many
     times the message content could not be any less related but the
     place to deal with it is the MATRIX.  There is also something to
     be said for tolerance since after all,  we can't create and
     support an echo for each and every facet of the human mind.


     o Therapeutic excercise

      I too, have felt the urge to reach out and flame someone!
     On such occasions I find the following method of response to be
     quite therapeutic and I only wish I could recall the name of the
     sysop from whom I got the idea. I call it the ZEN FLAME.
     The process is simple to implement and takes only fractionally
     more time than its present day counterpart. You go right ahead
     and blast away, do it, jump up and down and scream! After you are
     finished and save your message, read it... Out loud if you so
     desire, now comes the ingenious part of the procedure, you DELETE
     it before you log off! Very simple, very easy. You get the
     benefit of releasing the pent up frustration and telling the no
     good so and so what you think and then seeing it in print without
     burdening all other sysops and users with even more irritation
     than their lives already afford them!
     FidoNews 5-46                Page 25                  14 Nov 1988


     All this babbling boils down to a simple plea from myself and the
     others who may share my point of view.

     Stop and think of the BIG PICTURE each time you begin to post
     mail in any echomail area and above all, excercise self control
     so that others will not feel the need to impose it upon you! It
     has been said that " Freedom is the right to do your best. "
     The only true protection of your rights and freedoms lies in your
     willingness to govern yourself now before it's too late.

     Common sense dictates a network is not a place for selfish
     behavior. To become involved in it one must become aware of
     the rights of others who are affected.

                    The Alamo and the Mexican War

     "Remember the Alamo", is still a famous saying  in  Texas
     which  dates back to the middle 1800's during the time of the
     Mexican War. The war was between  Texas  and  Mexico.  Texas,
     fighting  for it's Independance. Mexico, fighting to keep and
     rule Texas as part of it's country.

     Once, Texas was part of Mexico, and during the time  when
     the  South  was  depressed  and people had depts to pay, they
     would move to Texas in order to form a new life. At the time,
     Mexico was offering 640 acres of untaxed land to  any  family
     who  would  turn  thier back on America, pledge alliegence to
     Mexico and change thier religion to Roman Catholic. But, soon
     Mexico began to get worried because too many  Americans  were
     moving  to  Texas.  Within  ten years after Stephen F. Austin
     established his colony, thirty thousand settlers had moved.

     In 1830 the Mexican government passed strict laws saying,
     immigrants were no longer allowed to come  to  Texas.  Mexico
     patrolled  the  border  very  carefully  but,  were unable to
     patroll the long border between Louisiana and Texas.

     Stephen Austin, for whom Texas's capitol is  named  after
     arrived  in  July  1833  to discuss with Mexico the fact that
     Texas wanted to secede and form thier own country with  thier
     own  government. Austin sent a letter to the Texans, advising
     them to form themselves as a separate  state  if  his  appeal
     failed.  However,  he was found out, and arrested in Saltillo
     on a charge of treason on January 3, 1834.

     Austin was jailed for 18 months before his release.  But,
     by this time almost all power over the Mexican Government had
     been  siezed  by  President Antonia Lo'pez de Santa Anna, who
     was elected in late 1833.

     In the fall of 1835, Santa Anna sent his  brother-in-law,
     General Martin Cos in charge of a band of mexican troops into
     Texas  to  patrol  the  border.  On  September  21st,  Austin
     announced that Cos had landed at Copano and  Texas  prepared.
     The  Mexican  Government was positive that the Texans were on
     the verge of rebellion from it's country.

     Cos's orders were to sieze the  cannon  kept  there.  The
     Texans  refused  to  give  up the cannon which they had put a
     flag on reading, "come and take it".  Suddenly,  hundreds  of
     Texans  came  from  the  countryside and startled the mexican
     army into retreating to San Antonio.

     On  March  2, 1836, 59 Texas leaders gathered in the tiny
     village  of  Washington, Texas.  Together,  they  wrote  the
     Texas Declaration of Independance and the Texas Constitution.
     The republic of Texas now existed, but the war to keep it was
     FidoNews 5-46                Page 27                  14 Nov 1988


     yet to come.

     On  February 23, 1836 Santa Anna's army of 6,000 tried to
     take on 200 Texans at the Alamo in San Antonio. Over a period
     of ten days the brave Texans killed over 1,500 mexicans.  The
     Texans drove them back  twice, before  the  mexicans  finally
     killed all the defenders of the Alamo on the  third  try.

     By then, the Texans had put together an army. Led by  Sam
     Houston  they  attacked  Santa  Anna's army during the night,
     during there time of slumber,  on  April  21,  1836,  in  San
     Jacinto.

     The left flank of the Texan line was comanded by a thirty
     year   old  Kentucky  businessman  who  came  to  Texas  with
     fifty-two volunteers he had found by himself. Colonel  Sidney
     Sherman was more direct than Houston and rather irritated and
     impatient  with  his commander's Zen-like strategy. When they
     were a few hundred yards from the  mexican  lines  he  loudly
     shouted,  "Remember  the Alamo!!". Which set imeasurable fury
     in the minds of the Texans. Remembering the Alamo, the Texans
     were filled with slaughter. Attacking the  enemy  with  bowie
     knives,  tomahawks,  rifle  butts,  and what little amunition
     they had left they  brutally  killed  those  who  begged  for
     mercy.  Santa  Anna  then  signed  a treaty declaring Texas's
     independance from Mexico. And as  the  carnage  of  that  day
     receded  into  history  and  Texas  became a tamer place, The
     phrase  "Remember  the  Alamo",  began  to  stand  more   for
     rememberance than vengence.

     From the desk of the KidsNews Editor:

     Veterans Day is a special time. As Americans gather at
     cemeteries and memorials throughout this great land, we
     are reminded that fundamentally we are a family. We pause
     this day to reflect on the love and commitment of nearly
     40 million living veterans who have served that family.
     We acknowledge that none have given fuller expression to
     that love than those who have died or been disabled in
     defense of our nation.

     We demonstrate today through our ceremonies and in our
     private thoughts and prayers America's lasting gratitude
     and admiration for those who have allowed us to prosper
     in peace and freedom. We reflect that such blessings are
     not universally enjoyed; that tyranny, aggression, and
     cruel terrorism challenge what so many Americans have
     fought and died to protect.

     We honor our veterans in a manner that befits the American
     family. Our nation might have chosen the anniversary of a
     FidoNews 5-46                Page 28                  14 Nov 1988


     great battle. Instead, we chose the anniversary od a great
     silence; the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the
     eleventh month when the guns of World War I at last were
     still. We celebrate not war, but the end of war. We are a
     people of peace.

     As we look with hope toward the day when the guns are
     forever silent, let us once again express appreciation to
     those whose splended heritage lives on in a new generation
     of servicemen and women who have taken their places on the
     battlements of American freedom.

                   An Introduction of Bob Swift (140/24)


     Most of you probably know Bob Swift from his postings of IFNA
     news in the IFNA national echo.  Bob is an IFNA Director at large
     who has been saddled with the job of keeping the membership
     informed of what is happening, as well as trying to keep the
     Board in line in the Board of Directors' echos.  He generates the
     formal motions (based on netmail from members of the Board),
     collects the votes, posts the results, and generally brings
     organization to the whole process.

     Bob's "real job" is as a registered Professional Mechanical
     Engineer in a coal-fired electrical generating station.  He's my
     first international personality in this column, living in the
     small Saskatchewan city of Estevan.  I got out my atlas, and it's
     just north of the North Dakota line.

     Bob's relative isolation was one of the contributing factors to
     getting him going as a BBS sysop.  There were no systems
     operating in his city of 10,000 people, so he had to cut his
     teeth on the BBS scene as a user by calling long distance.  To
     save others from having to go through this expensive experience,
     "Bob's Border BBS" was born.  (No, I had never heard of the
     original name of Bob's system when I named this column.)

     That system lasted for about three years, through two Commodore
     64's and three power supplies.  When Bob found that he had to
     compete with his users to use the computer, he bought an XT clone
     with a 10-meg hard disk and a 1200-baud modem.  How could anyone
     ever need more than that?

     Bob joined FidoNet in the Fido 11w days, at about the same time
     that echomail was coming on the scene.  "Bob's Border BBS" became
     "The Power Station", and has grown to 60 megs of disk and 9600
     baud, with more expansion planned.  Bob became the coordinator of
     net 140, and was one of the first elected members of IFNA's
     Board.

     When he's not watching sysops butt heads, Bob enjoys watching
     football, especially the Canadian game.  He's a long-time ticket
     holder for the Saskatchewan Roughriders.  He also enjoys reading,
     music, and photography.

     I hope you've enjoyed this short glimpse of Bob Swift.  Next
     week, Bill Albritton is "on tap".  If there is anyone you want to
     get to know, let me know.  If you're a "FidoNet personality",
     send me some dirt on yourself!

                      Yet Another Complicated Komment

                            by Steven K. Hoskin
                        ( STEVE HOSKIN at 1:128/31 )

                         Episode 16:  Network Mail


     FidoNet Network  Mail  is  such  a  neat  thing.   The ability to
     cheaply  use  this   electronic   mail   media  to  hold  private
     conversations, or send  letters  that  are readable and get there
     right away is just fascinating.

     Oh, sure, it doesn't hold  a  candle  to the glamour of EchoMail.
     In EchoMail you get to start, or  more likely join, in electronic
     mail conversations with  people  you  don't know.  Eventually, if
     you stick with it, you get  to  sorta'  know some of the regulars
     out there, start to feel  at  home  in  the conference, and maybe
     eventually meet them on vacation or at FidoCon.

     But once you know somebody,  that  NetMail  is SO neat for direct
     communications.  Cheap as SnailMail, fast as FedExpress.

     But getting people to recognize this is like pulling teeth.  I am
     the editor of a NewsLetter that keeps people I worked with in the
     Air Force on a  special  project  in  touch  with  each other.  I
     offered multiple  avenues;  I'll  make  the  current  NewsLetters
     available for viewing online,  downloading  (normal or archived),
     NetMail attachments,  messages,  local  messages...whatever.  And
     I'd continue to mail  it  to  those  not  taking advantage of the
     barrage of electronic alternatives.

     I explained  for  several  issues  how  to  use  FidoNet to their
     advantage.  Step by step.    Volunteered  to send the part of the
     NodeList that applied to  their  area  so they could pick a node.
     Volunteered to log  onto  their  chosen  board  and find specific
     keystrokes to get at the proper  areas.  To contact the SysOp and
     set up the NetMail account.  In short, do everything but send the
     money, that massive $5 most SysOps will start an account with.

     These  are  computer  folk,  too,  by  the  way.    Not  computer
     illiterate.

     One called my board and we CHATted  about it for 45 minutes about
     it before he said, "Now that we've  talked about it I can't wait.
     Get me that list!".  Geesh!  What  do I have to do, network their
     voice lines into their local Net Hosts' boards?

              Election Notice for Zone 1 Echomail Coordinator
                            David Dodell, 1:1/0


     As most of you know, Butch Walker has resigned as Zone 1 Echomail
     Coordinator.

     It is Butch's desire to have an election for the new Z1EC,  and I
     will be assisting by conducting those elections.

                          The plan is as follows:

     (1)  Applications  for  the  position  need to reach my system by
     Monday,  November 14th.  Any applications for the position should
     include  a  statement  from  the  candidate.  This  statement can
     contain anything the candidate wishes,  but I recommend that  the
     candidate express why he/she would be good for the position,  why
     he/she should be voted to the position,  and/or his/her policy on
     echomail.
         This  statement  should  be no longer then 80 x 24 (i.e.  one
         screen).

     (2) On the 14th of November, I will mail to the REC a copy of all
     of the candidate statements.  These should be disseminated to the
     NEC's in your region.

     (3) Voting will be done by the REC/NEC structure  only.  It  will
     be  the responsibility of all NEC to get their votes into the REC
     by November 30th.  The REC's will then  get  the  sub-totals  for
     their Regions into me by December 4th.

        Announcment  and  notification of the new Z1EC will be done on
        December 5th.

          regarding ram chips or his FidoNews survey

     Please be advised that Gene's system, which is 1:107/131, is
     apparently down.  My understanding is that it is in the
     process of being removed from the Nodelist due to Policy
     violations.  Therefore, you should expect no replies to your
     messages as they are undeliverable and are being deleted here.

     Sorry.

                           Steve Bonine   115/777

     This will be a short report.  As the saying goes, I have some
     good news and some bad news.

     The good news is that the new IFNA checking account in Chicago is
     now open and usable.  The bad news is that the funds are not yet
     transferred into it from the Hawaii account.

     Thus, I am not in a position to provide real numbers, and that
     isn't a great problem because (by definition) they haven't
     changed from last month.  As soon as I recieve the records and
     the funds from the previous treasurer, I will provide a status
     report here in FidoNews.
