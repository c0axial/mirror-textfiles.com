     To Whom It May Concern

     Thank you for your recent chain letter.  As a matter of practice, I
     don't forward these things, so you may rest assured that I've been
     doomed to the pits of hellfire and damnation... or whatever your
     chain letter specifies; I didn't really read through all the
     forwarding addresses and quote headers to catch the exact
     consequences.

     It's not that I want to be cavalier about this.  I suppose that
     there are supernatural forces in this world which could actually
     visit damnation on me.  I can even imagine that some would choose to
     spread their gospel through the electronic media rather than use the
     primitive technology of Gutenberg to disseminate bound volumes.
     But the buck stops here.  I may have bought a one-way ticket across
     the River Styx, but I'm not trying to sponsor a tour.

     You, on the other hand, are in deep doo-doo!  Did you forward this
     letter to ten people?  Then the best that you can hope for is that
     the other nine ignored you too, and will be waiting in Hell with me
     to get the SOB who sent us here.  It could be worse... maybe half
     the people you sent this to took your letter seriously and sent it
     to ten others.  Maybe half of these folks ignored the letter.  Now,
     instead of five folks waiting for you with mayhem on their mind, you
     have 25.  But it doesn't end here... there are still 25 people
     cranking out the tickets to the underworld which you are responsible
     for, and that might result in 125 damned souls and 125 folks who
     will help propagate your instrument of soul condemnation.  Pretty
     soon the place is gonna get crowded with a lot of folks ticked at
     YOU.

     Of course, you can avoid this fate by leading a holy life and
     faithfully passing on all the chain letters that you get.  Or can
     you?  Will you ever see the last of these missives?  If there aren't
     enough of these chain letters already floating around, you've set up
     the mechanism which ensures that you'll see them indefinitely into
     the future.  At some point in time, you'll weaken... maybe with age
     you'll no longer be able to click on the option which forwards these
     instruments of damnation... or maybe you'll run out of addresses.
     Not only have you doomed yourself to a Hell on Earth as you scurry
     to keep these chain letters flowing, but you're actively increasing
     the reception committee just waiting for you to slip up.

     I, on the other hand, may outlive you.  You see, I'll be leading an
     unfrenzied life doing exactly what I want... for my fate has been
     already sealed by you.  You probably won't need to worry about me
     when when I'm cast into the pit, though.  I'll be maintaining a
     discrete distance.  After all, _I_ am not the one who pissed off the
     millions of other damned!

     Dear FidoNet News Editor:

     I represent a large manufacturer of pet food and wonder if you could
     tell me a little more about your newsletter. My client is
     relaunching the Web site in a couple of months and we're looking for
     organizations and BBS in which we can place paid announcements --
     not too commercial sounding, just a few lines to introduce the new
     site. It's a nice site and has a lot of pet care information located
     throughout it.

     Do you accept advertising in your newsletter? I there another means
     in which we could place paid announcements throughout your system?
     Thanks in advance for the information. I look forward to hearing
     from you.

     Regards,

     Kim LaSalle

     [Editor's Reply]

     Dear Kim,

     Traditionally, Fidonews does not accept advertising.  It's not that
     we have anything against pet food or commercial enterprise, but
     Fidonet is a hobbiest network.  Fidonews is distributed by
     individual hobbiests in that network, who volunteer their time and
     effort.  I'd feel kinda guilty about soliciting paid advertising and
     yet watching these hobbiests move the newsletter with no
     compensation.

     Besides, I couldn't begin to give you demographics on our readers...

     Nonetheless, I'll be publishing your letter in the next edition of
     Fidonews... it lets the readers know of the advertising policy here.
     If there are BBS systems aboard who are interested in working with
     you, they're free to contact you.

     By the way, there's no charge for publishing a letter - even if it
     does contain information you probably would have put in an ad anyway
     :)

     You might be a Yankee if...

     The sound of Fran Drescher's voice doesn't bother you.

     You've watched the movie "Deliverance" and you're afraid to go on a
     camping trip.  Ever.

     For breakfast, you'd rather have potatoes than grits.

     You can name at least 4 hockey teams.

     You've never eaten Okra.

     You've never had bangs.(ed. note - OR if you do have them, they
     aren't several inches ABOVE the top of your head)

     You'd rather vacation at Martha's Vineyard than Six Flags.

     You don't have at least one can of WD-40 somewhere around the house.

     You would rather have your son become a lawyer than grow up to get
     his own TV fishing show.

     You refer to two or more people as "you guys" instead of "y'all".

     You think more money should go to important scientific research at
     your university than to pay the salary of the head football coach.

     You prefer a bagel over a donut.

     You don't know anyone with two first names (i.e. Joe Bob, Billy
     Bob,Kay Bob, Bob Bob, Sara Jane)

     Your idea of a perfect meal is "Lahbsta and Clam Chawdah."

     You use the horn in your car more than once or twice a year.

     Everything you know about the Civil War you learned watching TV.

     You don't "reckon".

     You're not "fixin" to do anything.

                             Water Closet Origin
                              Thanks to Roy Reed

     BEIJING - Britain's claim to have invented the water closet went
     down the drain with the discovery of a 2,000-year-old toilet
     complete with running water, a stone seat and a comfortable armrest.
     Officials say the antique latrine was found in the tomb of a king of
     the Western Han Dynasty, located in the central province of Henan.
     The king ruled from 206 BC to 24 AD and was said to believe that his
     soul would need to enjoy human life after death. London plumber
     Thomas Crapper has frequently been credited with the invention of
     the flush toilet and patented a U-bend siphoning system for flushing
     the pan in the late 19th century.

     [It was not mentioned whether a stack of ancient magazines were
     found next to the latrine.]

     a @ preceding an individual's name implies a virtual email
     address. The email is translated as follows
     firstlast@osirusoft.com will automatically route to the
     appropriate individual's email.  Anyone in this list will
     also receive routed notice of this feature.  In my case, it
     would still be joejared@osirusoft.com, but you get the idea.

     Also, as information is provided to me, I will be adding a
     latency field to each node, which is defined as the maximum
     time between when the message is received, and when it is
     sent on to other nodes, or available to be sent onward,
     defined in minutes. A latency of ! implies that there is an
     immediate response, and an attempt to deliver immediately
     after processing, or a "MinuteMail System", as it were.
