             Open Letter To Thom Henderson From An IFNA Member
                   (a copy of which has been netmailed)
                          Charlie Smith 1:141/880

     Thom, first of all let me congratulate you on the attainment of
     your position. I hope that you achieve everything that you want
     to achieve.

     As to this matter of IFNA and FidoNet, I would like to ask one
     simple question. Why does IFNA have to govern FidoNet?  Why can't
     FidoNet govern FidoNet?

     I appologize if this seems rather simplistic as I have been a
     member of IFNA for almost a year and I don't know anything of
     what is supposed to happen except for what I read.

     According to the Articles of Association that I have, IFNA was
     created for seven purposes:

     1. The promotion of interest in telecommunications and
     experimentation;

     2. The establishment of telecommunications networks to provide
     publicly accessable and available electronic communications;

     3. The furtherance of public welfare;

     4. The advancement of telecommunications and the fostering of
     education in the field of electronic communications;

     5. The promotion and conduct of research and development to
     further the developments in electronic communication;

     6. The dissemination of technical, educational and scientific
     information relating to electronic communications; and

     7. The printing and publishing of documents, books, magazines,
     newspapers and pamphlets necessary or incidental to any of the
     above purposes.

     None of these purposes require the governing of any network.
     Item 2 was accomplished by the formal formation of FidoNet and
     since IFNA was the "guardian" as such, maybe it is time to allow
     the emancipation of FidoNet. It appears that FidoNet has come of
     age.

     Maybe IFNA should go beyond the scope of FidoNet and find ways of
     bringing together all of the FidoNet Technical Compatible
     Networks as well as the non-compatible networks.

     FidoNews 6-42                Page 2                   16 Oct 1989


     Think about it, Thom. If IFNA was to the telecomputer
     communications world what the United Nations is to this Earth,
     IFNA would not have the time  to  worry  about any  one network.
     Just  look at the telecommunications world we live in and look at
     the diverse networks that exist. How can we tie them (or for that
     matter even get them) together so that we all can communicate
     with each other.

     I am sure that many other members feel like I feel in that IFNA
     has more purpose than responding to the needs and wishes of one
     particular network.

     I propose this to you. Call off the FidoNet "plebiscite". Do what
     you can to take IFNA to a higher plane of being. Forge a new
     direction for IFNA and let FidoNet come of age. I think you will
     find that FidoNet is more than capable of handling itself. And
     you will also find that people will be more receptive to IFNA, if
     they try to accomplish something instead of trying to rule over
     somebody.

     I paid my membership dues because I thought that IFNA was doing
     something to further the art of communications, not because I
     wanted to be part of FidoNet. I was already part of FidoNet. You
     don't need to pay anything to join FidoNet.  I do recognise that
     research costs money. That operation of an organization costs
     money. If you do what you propose, how do you plan to raise that
     money? How do you plan to further research? How do you plan to
     get the computer-communications world together? As a member, I
     want to know.

     "SEARCHLIGHT  (n).   An  electric  arc-light  or  other  powerful
     illuminant  concentrated  into a beam that can be turned  in  any
     direction for lighting channels."

     So says the Concise English Dictionary.  In everyday language, we
     perceive it to be, more simply, a powerful beam of light piercing
     through the darkness.

     Frank LaRosa's SEARCHLIGHT BBS can be likened to this beam.   Its
     powerful  features - harnessed to easy implementation and  use  -
     can  truly  be  said to illuminate the darkness and  gloom  which
     surrounds so many areas of Electronic Communications.

     Maintaining the balance between offering a sophisticated  vehicle
     for communicating coupled with a friendly interface has long been
     the   programmer's  nightmare.    Many  Bulletin  Board  programs
     sacrifice ease of use to the deities of power;  others cosset the
     end-user  and,  sadly,  lack much of the robustness demanded of a
     modern communications package.

     SEARCHLIGHT  has,   almost  effortlessly,   bridged  these   twin
     incompatibilities.   The software is optimised for both speed and
     power but,  importantly,  the SysOp retains full control over the
     performance  and appearance of the system.   It may be configured
     exactly  as he wishes with the aid of a simple  set-up  procedure
     and customised so as to make it totally 'user-friendly'.  Without
     compromise!

     A  testament  to  the careful planning and coding  undertaken  by
     Frank  LaRosa.   Having expended no little time in  bringing  his
     program to such a level of sophistication;  he is,  however, most
     responsive  to users' input and constructive criticism.   Much of
     the 'fine tuning' and some useful features have been incorporated
     directly as a result of his approachability and receptiveness.

     Surely  a  program such as this - however good - must  have  some
     demerits?

     Up  until  now,  just  one!   Whilst the  program  is  constantly
     undergoing revision and upgrading, its major deficit has been its
     lack of true FidoNet compatibility.

     It  has,  for some while,  been possible to interface  with  IFNA
     systems  by using additional software - by no means a 'kludge'  -
     but  essentially outside the SEARCHLIGHT environment.   A  little
     more maintenace for the busy SysOp to perform...

     No  longer!   With  SEARCHLIGHT  release  1.74D  and  the  SLMAIL
     utility,  full  FidoNet compatibility is assured.   SLMAIL  comes
     with  the  registered  SEARCHLIGHT package  and  handles  Netmail
     effortlessly.

     Combined with D'Bridge (which is highly recommended); SEARCHLIGHT
     will  certainly  illuminate the communications arena for  a  very
     long time to come!

     A FEELING OF ELECTRICITY IN THE AIR
     A short story
     By Kevin L. McNeil
     1:128/45.0
     (4 chapters)

          Lightning  cracked  the sky, painting the night with ragged
     lines  of white. Thunder rattled the window panes, and rain beat
     a  steady  drumming  on  the  roof.   Trash  and leaves from the
     streets  flew  in  the  air, propelled by the wind which sluiced
     down the streets.

         The phone rang, once.

         The  line  connected,  answering with a high-pitched squeal.
     Another   squeal  replied  and  after  a  second,  both  squeals
     stopped.

         The  video  monitor  glowed to life, green letters appearing
     rapidly  as the monitor received input from the computer for the
     first time that night.

          Susan  bent  close  to  the  lock,  blinking  as  rainwater
     dribbled  into  her eyes. John stood close behind her, shielding
     her with an almost collapsed umbrella.
          You want to come in?  she asked over her shoulder.
          Well, I had been thinking...
          She opened the door.  Sure, I'll make some coffee.
          John  followed  close behind her, shutting the door quickly
     as  a  gust  of  wind  blew  cold air and rain inside.  The door
     slammed and Susan turned around.
          Sorry,  John  said.  He took off his coat. Where can I hang
     this?
          Here,  she  said,  holding out her hand.  She hung up their
     wet coats while John looked around the living room.
          You have a nice place, he said, mostly to himself.
          Susan made an uh hmn sound from the kitchen.  While she was
     bent  down  behind the counter, he took a quick look into a room
     adjoining the living room.
          You've got a computer, he said.
          Yes,  she  said,  carrying  back  two  cups of coffee.  She
     handed  him  the  coffee.   It's  instant.   I  didn't feel like
     waiting.
          I guess most electricians own computers.
          I  don't  know,  Susan  said.   She  sat  on the couch.  My
     company   buys   them   for  the  employees.   And  I'm  not  an
     electrician.   I design circuitry, IC's, integrated circuits for
     computers.  You know, the chips the size of a pencil point.
          Oh,  sorry.   John  took a swallow from his coffee, smiling
     weakly,  his  cheeks strained from his smile.  Look, really, I'm
     sorry.   Blind dates are always mismatched.  I've never gone out
     with  a...  a  person who knows anything about electronics.  And
     you've probably never gone out with a CPA.
          Susan  smiled.  Oh  yes  I  have.  If  you're  friends with
     Madeline, you've gone out with CPA's.
          John took another swallow.  You know it's on?
          Susan  looked  confused.  She  said with a sideways glance,
     What's on?
          Your computer.
          Oh.
          Should it be on like that, all alone?
          She  laughed.   It's  probably getting a call from someone.
     It's programmed to answer calls for me.
          Could I see?
          Susan looked slightly irritated, then smiled.  Oh, why not?
     Sure. She stood up and John followed.
          The  monitor  screen  was  full  of glowing green type, new
     lines slowly being added to the bottom.

          What's that? John asked.
          Hell  if  I  know, Susan saud. She pulled out the chair and
     sat  down  before  the computer.  She pressed a key labeled ESC.
     The menu flashed before her eyes.

          She  pressed  T  and  the  screen  cleared. Then a flashing
     cursor appeared as her prompt.

     %WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

         The screen continued with the same garbage

         What did you do? John asked.
         I hung up on the creep.  Damn kid, probably.
         Do you get many of them, owning a computer, I mean?
         No, usually ...
         The phone rang, once.
         Susan  and  John  watched  as the computer went through it's
     greeting program.

     %FILE TO UPLOAD (Y,N)? yyyou are whoooooo ?? ??

         Shit! Susan said. Doesn't he know enough is enough?
         She went to the menu again and hung up.
         The phone rang again almost instantly.

         You better just unplug it, John suggested.
         Susan unplugged the phone from the wall.
