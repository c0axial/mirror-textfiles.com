     =================================================================

     Greetings,

     On my question in the 16-07 issue about Z2 and in particular R29,
     I received a very interesting e-mail from a SysOp there.

     It seems, that the Z2C just wants to show how big or is it small,
     he can be.  What a great pity.  As the saying goes: it takes all
     kinds to make the world go round. ;-)

     Since I do have the full message and the authors name here on file,
     he has given permission to use it.

     Some interesting articles this week.  From a message I saw, Bob
     Satti has decided not stand for another term as Z1C.  Thats the
     spirit Bob, one should not have two *C positions as far as I'm
     concerned.  ;-)

     Happy reading,

     =================================================================


     I'm not sure why I'm doing this... you'd think I'd learn.  Last year
     I announced a candidacy for the Z1EC election, only to find that the
     election I'd expected never happened.  Things are different this
     year, though.  In announcing for the Z1C sysop-level election, I'm
     not expecting it to be held.  In fact, there's been no hint from the
     Zone 1 RC's, who are empowered by policy to elect a Zone
     Coordinator, that there are any plans afoot, let alone a sysop-level
     election.  I'm interpreting the silence from the RC's as an
     indication that Bob Satti will receive a vote of confidence, as
     happened last year, and this will serve as an election for an
     additional two-year term.

     So why run for an office when I don't expect an open election?
     Mostly because I believe that there should be one.  There are at
     least two good reasons for this:

     1.  Fidonet sysops have expressed a consistent desire that
     representative positions be determined by sysop-level election
     rather than by the appointments specified in Policy 4.  It's become
     fairly common practice at the NC level and a growing number of RC's
     are elected... but not the ZC.

     2.  Bob Satti currently holds the simultaneous positions of Zone
     Coordinator for Zone 1 and International Coordinator for all of
     Fidonet.  One of these positions is more than enough for one man -
     it's time to let go.

     Whether there is an open election or not, I intend to start acting
     like a candidate.  Currently I plan to discuss two issues which I
     consider core to the ZC position - the shrinking nodelist and the
     subject of elections.  Following those discussions, I'll try to
     follow up on whatever feedback comes from echomail and netmail.

     One outcome I'd like to see from this announcement is the
     encouragement of other candidates to announce so we can get a real
     forum going.  Perhaps Bob Satti will even join us.  I'd especially
     like to see the sysops of Fidonet actually conduct an open election
     themselves rather than waiting for the RC's to make a decision.
     Such an election would not be binding on the RC's of course, but
     would effectively communicate to them the expectations of the
     sysops.  Hopefully the RC's would realize that this is a healthy
     process, and seriously consider it.

     Perennial sport in the Fido echoes is the roasting of non-elected
     coordinators.  Currently, Martin Belcke (Regional Coordinator of
     Region 11) is the recipient of the honors, but he shares the
     limelight on a rotating basis with Dallas Hinton (RC17) and Bob
     Satti (Zone 1 Coordinator and International Coordinator), with
     occasional guest appearances by other notables.

     In all fairness, the criticism doesn't center on Martin's
     performance as RC.  Indications are that he does a good job in that
     capacity, and probably enjoys widespread support in his own region.
     The criticism centers on a deep-seated conviction on the part of
     many that representative positions in Fido should be determined by
     regularly-scheduled, public elections.  Unfortunately, Fido policy
     doesn't actually require elections - all coordinator positions are
     appointments by policy.  However, it's become customary for a
     substantial number of these positions to hold public, sysop-level
     elections with the elected candidate then appointed per policy, and
     proponents of elections want that practice uniformly applied.

     Election advocates make several claims to support their wishes:

     1.  Elections, if uniformly applied, would revitalize Fidonet.

             This seems highly doubtful to me, as the main reason for
             Fido's shrinking nodelist seems to be the simple fact that
             computer enthusiasts have found the Internet more attractive
             than local BBSes.


     2.  Elections yield better leaders.

             This is unsupported, and I doubt that it can be
             demonstrated.  However, I believe regularly-scheduled
             elections encourage some minimum of responsiveness from
             representatives, or - at least - provide a means for their
             removal at the next election if unsatisfactory.


     3.  Elections "validate" a coordinator.

             This seems to be the strongest argument for elections to
             me.  No matter how controversial the election, most folks
             recognize a voting process as valid.


     Martin and his supporters offer several reasons to decline holding
     an election:

     1.  Sysops in the region have indicated that they don't want an
     election - to hold one would act against the wishes of the majority.

     FIDONEWS 16-09               Page 4                    1 Mar 1999


             There does seem to be some validity to the claim that sysops
             in the region are generally satisfied with their present
             representation, or - at least - aren't in open revolt.
             Unfortunately, the basis for that claim isn't solid.
             Surveys have been conducted by both proponents and opponents
             of elections with, supposedly, conflicting results.

             I suspect that sysops in the region have no desire to elect
             another candidate, but are not necessarily opposed to
             holding elections.  It's hard for me to see how an actual
             election would be any more of an imposition than all the
             surveys.


     2.  Elections are a messy procedure, leading to vocal conflict and
     general disharmony.

             If they're done right, this is true.  However, what's the
             alternative?  Morphine injections?


     3.  Elections don't necessarily lead to agreement; those who
     supported a candidate before still support him, those who didn't
     still don't, and those who didn't care still don't.

             It's certain that the arguments still go on after an
             election, often with charges of election irregularities.
             Still, most folks eventually concede that the fellow who got
             the most votes should represent.


     My prediction is that sysop-level elections for Regions 11 and 17
     and for the Z1C position won't happen in the near future... but they
     should.  Not because Fido will somehow be revitalized with
     elections, not because the unelected coordinators have done a poor
     job, but simply because Fido should be in the hands of the sysops
     who are members.

     SPAM-lite in FidoNews?

     Dear Editor:

     It was with growing dismay that I read the two-page press release
     from Fast Engines, Inc. embedded in FIDO1606.NWS, touting their
     new web server utility.  What made it worse was that it was the
     longest "article" in the Snooze -- although that is not the point.
     I'm really very disappointed.

     I didn't like the idea when you announced in FIDO1547.NWS that you
     would allow ads that related to "BBSs and/or Fidonet", but I assumed
     that you meant it would be limited to commerical products applicable
     to the majority of FidoNet.

     I assumed wrongly, it seems.  Since the simple majority of us still
     run POTS dial-up BBSi and don't run web servers, Fast Engine's
     product has no utility for us.  In fact, it amounts to SPAM-lite, if
     you will --a little less salty but it still gets piped directly to
     an audience that didn't solicit the ad, can't use the product, don't
     want it and still must pay to haul and store it.

     I note that several to the Snooze Editor on this subject were
     published in 1998 (Gary Petersen, Dave Garland in FIDO1523, Doc
     Logger in FIDO1547) and that all of them were objections.  When
     Zorch raised the question FIDO1522, he appeared to have qualms about
     the appropriateness of commerical ads.  Since the readership has
     commented that it doesn't want commerical ads, I ask that you revise
     your stand and cease publishing them.

     If I'm hungry for highly processed stuff in a brightly colored
     package, I'll seek it out on my own.

         communication(s).
         No one editor, regardless for which or what publication it might

     Grunged Echomail Deleted (a Response)
     by Jerry Schwartz 1:142/928

     A couple of weeks ago, Roy Tellason asked about the
     appropriateness of suppressing long (30kb) messages from the
     echomail distribution system.  While I'm no expert in this
     matter, I can address his question about whether or not people
     are running software which needs to be protected from messages of
     this size.  Not long ago, I posted a series of messages which
     were in the 16k range (approximately).  I checked to make sure
     they weren't much bigger than that, but I didn't check their size
     exactly.

     I should have been more careful, I guess: one or another of those
     messages prevented my uplink from tossing the entire bundle!
     Again, I can't say what the limit is but I was certainly
     surprised that an OS/2 system running Squish would have problems
     with anything I, running the DOS version of Squish, could
     generate.

     So the answer is "Yes."  Anyone posting messages in the 16kb+
     range is creating a technical problem.  As a technical solution,
     I'd certainly prefer to see messages split, rather than bounced
     or deleted, but I'm not in charge around here.

     -----------------------------------------------------------------


     Letter from a concerned reader?

     (Henk, you may use this in FidoNews or not, as you wish.  I am
     posting it here only because this is the closest thing to an
     administrative echo that is available to non-members.)

     I have been a Fidonet user since 1995, and have seen a bit of the
     discussion (and I use that word loosely) concerning administrative
     and policy matters of all sorts.  I have observed (and
     occasionally taken part in) arguments over everything from the
     validity of Policy 4.07 and the need for an Echo Policy to the
     multiplicity of backbones and the effectiveness or
     ineffectiveness of certain hat-wearers.

     Although I wasn't around at the time, I understand all these
     counterproductive arguments are due to Fidonet's departure from
     the ideals and goals set by its founder, Tom Jennings.  in fact,
     if what I have read is true, it was this very sort of
     in-fighting that led Mr. Jennings to leave Fidonet.

     Here is my revolutionary suggestion:  Let us beseech Tom Jennings
     to return to Fidonet as a sort of one-man "supreme court" with
     the authority to arbitrarily overturn any existing policy and any
     FIDONEWS 16-09               Page 7                    1 Mar 1999


     actions (or inactions) taken by officials at any level of Fidonet,
     with such authority limited to a period of, say, two years.  While
     the power of such a position may not appeal to Mr. Jennings,
     perhaps the opportunity to put fidonet back on track would be
     sufficient to bring him out of his self-imposed retirement.

     Just imagine the possibilities.  At last we would know if Policy
     4.07 actually serves the best interests of Fidonet as seen by its
     "founding father".  We'd know for certain if ZCs must come from
     within the ranks of RCs, or if any sysop is eligible to run for
     the post.  We'd even have someone with the authority to find out,
     once and for all, if Zorch Frezburg and Mark Hernandez are the
     same person!

     Please consider my suggestion carefully and seriously.  Discuss
     it among yourselves.  Fidonet membes, feel free to kick the idea
     around in your admin echoes.  No one knows how Fidonet should be
     better than Tom Jennings, and it would be nice to have a
     "benevolent dictator" whose only interest was the good of Fidonet
     itself.  Of course, actually getting Mr. Jennings to take such a
     job might be difficult, and getting him to stay with it for two
     full years without getting disgusted and leaving again may be
     well-night impossible; but we'll never know unless we try.

     Walter, wluffman@usit.net

     ED: Walter, I do not know the reason why Tom has left FidoNet,
         but what you are 'saying' has merit. ;-)

     The Shrinking Nodelist - What can be done?

     Douglas Myers, 1:270/720, doug@mdtnbbs.com

     In this article, I'm discussing one of the issues I feel is
     pertinent to the Z1C election.  In a separate article, I've
     announced my candidacy for this position; please note, however, that
     there's been no indication from the RC's that there will be an open
     election, so I may simply be talking through a non-existent "hat."

     Fidonet is losing nodes, particularly in Zone 1.  The evidence is
     clear, in that each week I compile a smaller nodelist.  This
     shrinking nodelist has been blamed on all sorts of things:
     excessive fighting in the echoes, lack of democratic elections
     throughout Fido, inaction by the Zone Coordinator and Regional
     Coordinators...

     While I would certainly like to see a friendlier atmosphere in the
     echoes... while I support the concept of sysop-level elections...
     and while there are some areas I'd like to see the ZC and RC's
     address... I don't think any of the above actions would reverse the
     trend of the shrinking nodelist.  Sysops are simply taking down
     their BBSes because computer owners have chosen to connect to the
     world through the Internet instead.
     FIDONEWS 16-09               Page 8                    1 Mar 1999


     This is not necessarily bad news - the same internet technology
     which has attracted the general public away from Fido has also given
     us the means to maintain low-cost connections despite a smaller
     number of nodes.  We can live with a smaller nodelist, and still
     have a viable and quality network.

     This doesn't mean we have to be passive and let Fido be swallowed by
     the Internet, but it does mean that we need to stop using the size
     of the nodelist as the sole indicator of the health of Fido.  The
     health of Fido is best indicated by how we, the hobbyists, enjoy the
     hobby.  If we maintain Fido in a state that we, the sysops, enjoy...
     then the job of inviting guests to join us will be all that much
     easier.

     The work has already begun - many individuals and teams have chosen
     to do something positive about the changing nature of Fidonet.  Mail
     has long been transferred over the Internet, reducing costs and
     improving availability.  The nodelist format has been positively
     altered to facilitate the integration of nodes operating strictly
     from the Internet.  Enterprising sysops have offered QWK packets and
     Blue Wave packets to individuals through internet email attachments,
     effectively allowing individuals to function as users of their BBS
     without the necessity of logging on... and providing a low-cost
     alternative to the telenetable BBS.  At least one net has
     established an information package for internet users, offering
     instructions for using the commonly-available windows terminal
     program to log onto a local BBS.  All these efforts should be
     encouraged and expanded where possible.

     The shrinking nodelist isn't the death of Fidonet.  If we make Fido
     the kind of place where we want to be, folks will join us.

      1.0  Introduction
     ===================


      1.1  Purpose of this Document
     -------------------------------

     This Service Level Agreement has been assembled as a means to provide
     information about the Zone 1 Backbone, how it operates, what it
     offers, what it expects in return, and to provide insight as to its
     internal administration.

     This document is updated as circumstances and practices change.
     Please ensure that you are referencing a current edition.


      1.2  Definitions
     ------------------

     Zone 1 Backbone - A group of volunteer FidoNet hubs who help
             distribute echomail and routed netmail in FidoNet Zone 1
             (North America). The structure is customarily recognized as a
             set of tiers with the intention of distributing echomail in an
             accurate and expeditious manner.  Hereafter in this document
             the Zone 1 Backbone is referred to simply as the Z1B.

     Echo or Conference - An echomail conference is a message base or
             forum, distributed under a specified echomail conference name
             or tag, dealing with a defined area of interest.  Hereafter in
     FIDONEWS 16-09               Page 10                   1 Mar 1999


             this document echomail conferences are referred to simply as
             echoes.

     Zone 1 Backbone Hub - A hub who helps to distribute mail within the
             Zone 1 Backbone.  Tier 1 Z1B Hubs, also known as ZHubs or
             Stars, distribute mail at the zone level.  They are fully
             meshed with each other for speed and reliability.  Tier 2 Z1B
             Hubs, also known as RHubs, distribute mail at the region
             level.  Tier 3 Z1B Hubs distribute mail at the net level.

     Zone 1 Backbone Coordinator (Z1BC) - Person responsible for the
             day-to-day operation of the Zone 1 Backbone.  He coordinates
             routing to ensure reliable and efficient transport of echomail
             and Z1B-routed netmail while avoiding creation of duplicate
             messages.  He also serves as liaison to the ZEC and to other
             distribution systems.

     Echomail Coordinators (ECs) - Echomail Coordinators have been
             recognized by Fidonet since 1987.  The Zone Echomail
             Coordinator (ZEC) functions at the zone level.  Region
             Echomail Coordinators (RECs) function at the region level.
             Net Echomail Coordinators (NECs) function at the net level.

     BACKBONE.Z1B - A text file listing all echoes, and their descriptions,
             which are presently distributed by the Zone 1 Backbone.  This
             text file is formatted in a manner which makes it easily
             readable by echomail distribution software to use as a
             "forward list".  It is published weekly by the Z1BC and
             distributed in the BACKBONE file area.

     BACKSTAT.Z1B - A text file containing the Zone 1 Backbone status
             report which, among other things, itemizes echoes which are in
             the process of being added to or dropped from the Zone 1
             Backbone, as well as listing the Tier 1 and 2 Z1B Hubs, and
             the Z1BC.  It is published weekly by the Z1BC and distributed
             in the BACKBONE file area.  It is advisable that those who
             rely on the Zone 1 Backbone get in the habit of reading this
             file.

     SLA_xxxx.Z1B (xxxx = yymm version) - This document.  It is published
             monthly by the Z1BC and distributed in the BACKBONE file area.

     Moderator - Person(s) responsible for an echo and its liaison with the
             Zone 1 Backbone.

     EchoList - A database containing a list of echoes, published monthly
             by the EchoList Coordinator (1:1/21).  It customarily contains
             echo names, moderator names and addresses, and descriptions of
             the echoes.

     Gateways - Echomail Gateways are nodes whose systems are used to
             exchange mail with other groups.  The term Gateway, as used
             here, includes all forms of gating including, but not limited
             to, FidoNet zone gating, inter-distribution system gating,
             inter-network gating, and domain gating.

      1.3  Service Level Agreement
     ------------------------------

     The members of the Z1B agree to distribute mail in the most accurate
     and expeditious manner possible within their means.  Although they
     agree to provide the best service possible, they do not have control
     over all of the factors thus some problems might occur occasionally.
     Netmail messages which are time critical or require sensitive handling
     should be sent direct.

     The Tier 1 and 2 Z1B Hubs agree to make available all echoes which
     are listed in BACKBONE.Z1B.  Tier 3 Z1B Hubs are not obligated to
     distribute all listed echoes.  In no case does any Z1B Hub agree to
     distribute any echo which, in their own opinion, could subject them to
     consequences which might have a negative effect on their well being.

     The Z1B encourages the use of "echo-path routed netmail" (ERN) as a
     means of keeping echo volume and off-topic posts at a reasonable
     level.  Z1B Hubs agree to accept routed netmail from any node who
     connects with them. Any netmail message with a deliverable destination
     within FidoNet, regardless of its origin, is accepted.

     The Z1B Hubs agree to route ERN according to the wishes of the
     individual nets.  The Z1B Hubs depend on regional routing maps
     provided by the RECs to represent these wishes.  The Z1B encourages
     all nets to list every ERN connection path to the nearest Tier 1 (zone
     level) Hub, regardless of distribution system, in their region's
     chart.  This will allow ERN to follow the best path available.  When
     these paths are not known or are not available, Z1B Hubs agree to
     route ERN along echomail paths or to a ZC, RC, or NC who has agreed to
     handle such mail.

     The Z1B Hubs agree that ERN is for personal messages.  It is not for
     commercial messages, echoes, tunneling, mailing lists, news groups,
     file-attaches, "encoded" files, pyramid letters, or chain letters.
     Thus, the Z1B Hubs do not agree to route such messages.

     The Z1B Hubs agree to treat all in-transit netmail as private mail.
     The Z1B Hubs agree to not read or disclose routed netmail which passes
     through their systems, except as required for technical or legal
     reasons.

     The Z1B consists of volunteers.  It does not agree to handle any echo
     which could take the fun out of the hobby.  Use of Z1B services should
     be viewed as a privilege, not a right.  Any or all of these services
     may be terminated at any time, without any prior notice.

     All Z1B Hubs agree to the terms of this document.


      1.4  Z1B Relationship to FidoNet
     ----------------------------------

     The Z1B is indeed part of FidoNet.  It's made up of a voluntary group
     of FidoNet members.  It exists within FidoNet and must abide by
     FidoNet Policy, just as any other FidoNet node or group of FidoNet
     FIDONEWS 16-09               Page 12                   1 Mar 1999


     nodes.

     However, the Z1B is not an entity or sub-division of FidoNet in the
     sense that it is not mandated or defined by FidoNet Policy and is not
     operated by FidoNet officials.

     There is no requirement for the Z1B to offer services and there is no
     requirement for anyone to use the Z1B's services.

     This document is not a part of FidoNet Policy.  Should any part of
     this document conflict with FidoNet Policy, then FidoNet Policy shall
     prevail.


      1.5  Changes to this Document
     -------------------------------

     This document is changed only as the result of a two-thirds vote.
     Anyone may propose a change by finding a Tier 1 or 2 Z1B Hub who is
     willing to sponsor it for them.



      2.0  Z1B Administration
     =========================


      2.1  Voting
     -------------

     Tier 1 and 2 Z1B Hubs, as listed in BACKSTAT.Z1B, get 1 vote each.
     Nobody else may vote.  All voting is by public ballot in the Z1B_Coord
     echo.  The standard voting period is 1 week.

     Unless specified otherwise, a majority vote (more than half of those
     voting) is the norm.  Certain decisions, as noted, require a
     two-thirds vote (at least two-thirds of those voting).

     A recall vote can not be held until at least 4 months has elapsed
     since the prior selection or recall vote for the person holding that
     position.


      2.2  Selection of Z1B Hubs
     ----------------------------

     Tier 1 Z1B Hubs are selected by a majority vote.  They are normally
     chosen from amongst the Tier 2 Z1B Hubs.  They serve an indefinite
     term but are subject to recall by a two-thirds vote.

     Tier 2 Z1B Hubs are selected by a majority vote.  Anyone may apply by
     finding a Tier 1 or 2 Z1B Hub who is willing to nominate them.  The
     applicant should connect to either a Tier 1 or 2 Z1B Hub and route
     netmail and/or echomail for at least a few nets other than their own.
     They serve an indefinite term but are subject to recall by a
     two-thirds vote.
     FIDONEWS 16-09               Page 13                   1 Mar 1999


     Tier 3 Z1B Hub selection is left up to the individual nets.


      2.3  Selection of the Z1BC
     ----------------------------

     The Z1BC is selected by a majority vote.  Anyone may apply by finding
     a Tier 1 or 2 Z1B Hub who is willing to nominate them.  He serves a 1
     year term but is subject to recall by a two-thirds vote.

     Note:  The term of the current Z1BC expires on April 1, 1999.


      2.4  Administrative Areas
     ---------------------------

     The Z1B uses two echoes of its own and two shared file areas to
     conduct its business.

     The Z1BACKBONE echo is open to any node having business with the Z1B.
     The moderator for this area is selected by a majority vote.  He serves
     an indefinite term but is subject to recall by a two-thirds vote.

     The Z1B_COORD echo is restricted to Tier 1 and 2 Z1B Hubs, the Z1BC,
     and invited guests.  Guests are invited by a majority vote.  The
     moderator for this area is the Z1BC.

     The Z1B also makes use of the shared BACKBONE and Z1_REC file areas.



      3.0  Moderators
     =================


      3.1  Moderator Identification
     -------------------------------

     The Z1B refers to the current EchoList in order to identify an echo's
     moderator.  As far as the Z1B is concerned, all individuals listed as
     moderators or co-moderators of a particular echo are equal.  In case
     of disagreement, however, the moderator listed first has priority.

     Moderators are encouraged to appoint co-moderators to assist them in
     their duties and to stand in for them in their absence.  This will
     ensure that the echo is properly maintained, especially in the case of
     a moderator who is frequently absent for long periods of time.


      3.2  Moderator Responsibilities
     ---------------------------------

     The responsibilities of a moderator of an echo which the Z1B
     distributes are:

         1)  Seeing that messages in their echo correspond to the echo's
     FIDONEWS 16-09               Page 14                   1 Mar 1999


             theme.

         2)  Updating their echo's listing in the Echolist at least every
             six months.

         3)  Preventing the distribution of their echo from interfering
             with the operation of the Z1B.

         4)  Must be accessible via netmail through known channels.

         5)  Seeing that messages in their echo do not violate the
             standards set in Section 4.

     When moderators place their echoes on the Z1B they must realize that
     Z1B Hubs distribute publicly available echoes and that the job of
     enforcing any kind of access restrictions remains with the moderator.
     These restrictions, as well as the echo's rules, are usually available
     in the EchoList so that any Sysop interested in the echo may review
     them prior to actually carrying the echo on his or her system.


      3.3  Moderator Tools
     ----------------------

     The Z1B provides some "tools" to a moderator in order to help him/her
     carry out their responsibilities.

     If a moderator believes that a node is violating an echo rule, he/she
     may request the feed to that node be severed.  This request is made in
     written form (netmail), to the Z1B Hub feeding the offending node,
     with a copy to the offending node.  It is recommended that a copy also
     be sent to the node's NEC so that he or she is aware of such problems
     in the net and can provide information and assistance.

     Some important points to remember regarding feed cut requests:

         1) Feed cuts should be initiated with an effort to cause the least
            amount of disruption to the echo.

         2) In most cases, the main goal of a feed cut is to remove a
            REPEAT offender who is likely to cause future echo disruption.

         3) Echo rule offenders are, in most cases, PEOPLE - not systems.

         4) SYSTEMS should not be cut until efforts to remove the PERSON
            have failed.  Moderators should attempt to resolve problems as
            close to the root of the problem as possible, i.e., user first,
            SysOp second, hub third, etc.

         5) Feed cuts at the zone level are taken very seriously.  Only use
            them as a last resort after all other means have failed.  Have
            proper documentation ready to support a link cut request at the
            zone level showing that all other efforts have failed.

         6) Feed cut requests are just that - requests.  Communications
            should be polite and not demanding as you are REQUESTING help
     FIDONEWS 16-09               Page 15                   1 Mar 1999


            from another system.


      3.4  Echo Addition
     --------------------

     The Z1BC adds an echo to Z1B distribution when all of these
     requirements are met:

         1)  The moderator lists the echo in the EchoList.  See the
             EchoList FAQ for information about how to do this.

         2)  The moderator requests that the echo be distributed by the
             Z1B.  The request should be sent from one of the moderator
             addresses listed in the EchoList, via one of the following
             methods, preferably "A".

                 A)  Echomail:  To "Z1B", in the Z1BACKBONE echo
                 B)  Netmail:  To "Z1B", at the Z1BC's FidoNet address
                 C)  Email:  To the Z1BC's Internet address, subject "Z1B"

             The body of the request should consist of a current copy of
             the EchoList listing for the echo.  This could be taken from a
             recent message from the EchoList (netmail, email or echomail)
             or be an excerpt from the current EchoList itself.

             The echo is then listed in BACKSTAT.Z1B as requesting
             addition.

         3)  Within one month of being initially being listed in
             BACKSTAT.Z1B, two Tier 1 or 2 Z1B Hubs and/or RECs request
             that the Z1B distribute the echo.  The requests should be sent
             via one of the following methods, preferably "A".

                 A)  Echomail:  To "Z1B", in the Z1BACKBONE echo
                 B)  Netmail:  To "Z1B", at the Z1BC's FidoNet address
                 C)  Email:  To the Z1BC's Internet address, subject "Z1B"

             The requests are noted in BACKSTAT.Z1B.

             If two requests are not forthcoming, prior to the one month
             expiring the moderator may request a one month extension from
             the Z1BC.

     The echo is then added to BACKBONE.Z1B and this is noted in
     BACKSTAT.Z1B. A welcome message is sent in the echo to help establish
     links.  At this time any private links to the echo should be switched
     to the Z1B.


      3.5  Echo Removal
     -------------------

     The Z1BC removes an echo from Z1B distribution when any of these
     situations occur:

     FIDONEWS 16-09               Page 16                   1 Mar 1999


         1)  The echo is not listed in the EchoList.  The echo is first
             listed as "not in EchoList" in BACKSTAT.Z1B for up to 3
             months, then it is dropped entirely.  During these 3 months,
             weekly warning messages are posted in the echo alerting the
             moderator and the users as to the echo's status.  If at any
             time during these 3 months it is re-listed in the EchoList
             then it's status is restored.

         2)  Unconditionally when the moderator sends a direct request to
             the Z1BC that the echo be removed.  The request should be sent
             from one of the moderator addresses listed in the EchoList, to
             one of the following:

                 A)  Echomail:  To "Z1B", in the Z1BACKBONE echo
                 B)  Netmail:  To "Z1B", at the Z1BC's FidoNet address
                 C)  Email:  To the Z1BC's Internet address, subject "Z1B"

         3)  The moderator fails to properly carry out his
             responsibilities (see Section 3.2).

         4)  The traffic level in the echo falls below 2 messages for any
             month.  The echo is first listed as "low traffic" in
             BACKSTAT.Z1B for up to 6 months, then it is dropped entirely.
             If at any time during these 6 months the traffic level rises
             to or above 5 messages for any month then it's status is
             restored.

             The Z1B drops echoes when the traffic level falls below a
             minimum:

                 A) To encourage the formation of new echoes, like pruning
                    dead branches off a tree.

                 B) To save the SysOps and users from the frustration of
                    setting up areas only to find that they are dead.

         5)  When it is decided by a two-thirds vote that the distribution
             of an echo is not in the best interest of the Z1B.

     All changes in status of echoes are noted in BACKSTAT.Z1B.


      3.6  Echo Name Change
     -----------------------

     In order to change the name of an echo which is currently distributed
     by the Z1B, without the necessity of reapproval, you should:

         1)  EchoList the new echo name.

         2)  Set a date for the change to occur.  This date should give
             all concerned plenty of time to prepare.  Generally, a 3-4
             week notice should suffice.  The proposed date for the change
             should fall on a Sunday.

         3)  Spread the word of the impending name change.  Do so in the
     FIDONEWS 16-09               Page 17                   1 Mar 1999


             affected echo, the Z1BACKBONE echo, and via netmail or email
             to the Z1BC.

         4)  Item 3 should be repeated at least once per week before the
             name change is to occur.

         5)  On the day before the change is to occur, send a netmail
             reminder to the Z1BC.

         6)  The change occurs.  The new echo name is added to BACKBONE.Z1B
             and the old echo name is removed.



      4.0  Standard Operating Procedures
     ====================================


      4.1  Technical Standards
     --------------------------

     The Z1B observes FTSC specifications FTS-0001 and FSC-0074.  Notes:

         1)  All Z1B Hubs use the pathline.

         2)  The Z1B considers the "toUserName", "fromUserName" and
             "Origin Line" to be control information lines, thus character
             set restrictions apply.

         3)  The requirement that control information lines shall contain
             only ASCII characters, from 32 to 126, is extended to include
             hi-bit alphabetic characters, including 128 to 168, 173, and
             224 to 240.

         4)  Echomail messages older than 30 days may considered to be
             dupes. This technique has undergone much testing and has
             proven its value in preventing dupes due to massive rescans
             without interfering with the flow of normal echomail.

         5)  Due to the limitations of some current software, the Z1B can
             not guarantee delivery of messages in excess of 30K bytes.
             Z1B Hubs are encouraged to use message processing software
             which allows larger messages, preferably up to 64K bytes, to
             be handled.  Z1B Hubs may split large messages to ensure their
             safe passage.

     Z1B Hubs may delete messages which do not conform to these technical
     standards when such messages might be harmful to the technical
     operation of the Z1B.  This includes duplicate messages and "grunged"
     messages. Such messages are generally not returned.

     Z1B Hubs operate in a secure fashion.  They automatically process
     inbound messages only from those nodes with which prior agreements
     have been made. Normally this means that Z1B Hubs use session
     passwords and secure ("protected") inbound areas.  However, any
     reasonable method of ensuring that non-secure messages do not enter
     FIDONEWS 16-09               Page 18                   1 Mar 1999


     the Z1B is acceptable.

     A Z1B Hub may choose not to provide services to a node which does not
     operate in a secure fashion.


      4.2  Gateways
     ---------------

     Gateways must remove foreign distribution identifiers (including
     seen-bys) which might adversely affect the distribution of the echo on
     the Z1B. Pathlines, however, should be left intact.  The origin line
     should be that of the Gateway.

     Gateways also pass netmail into the other network, unless it is
     technically impossible to do so.


      4.3  Encrypted Messages
     -------------------------

     Some Z1B Hubs do not allow encrypted messages to flow through their
     systems.  Therefore, the Z1B does not agree to handle encrypted
     messages in routed netmail or in echoes, excepting digital signatures
     and occasional demonstration and/or test messages.


      4.4  Encoded Files in Echoes
     ------------------------------

     Echomail is not an efficient method of transporting files.  There are
     many File Distribution Networks which can be used instead.  Thus the
     Z1B does not distribute any echo which routinely contains large
     (multi-message) encoded files.  The use of an echo for small or
     occasional encoded files is left up to the discretion of its
     moderator.


      4.5  Illegal Activities
     -------------------------

     The Z1B does not distribute any echo which routinely contains
     messages which contain illegal information, or promote illegal
     activities.  As used in this paragraph, "illegal activities" includes
     activities which are a violation of civil law as well as activities
     which could result in criminal prosecution.


      4.6  Censorship of Messages
     -----------------------------

     Z1B Hubs do not delete or alter messages as they are distributed,
     except for technical reasons.

     If a Z1B Hub feels that netmail messages may lead to legal action
     against him then he may decline to handle such messages, as per
     FIDONEWS 16-09               Page 19                   1 Mar 1999


     FidoNet Policy.

     If a Z1B Hub feels that echomail messages may lead to legal action
     against him then he may decline to handle that echo in its entirety,
     notifying the echo's moderator.

     The Z1B does not distribute any echo which routinely contains
     counterfeit messages.  A counterfeit message is any message entered
     using another person's name, handle, or node address with the intent
     of deceiving others about the true author of the message.


      4.7  Anonymous Remailers
     --------------------------

     An "Anonymous Remailer" (AR) is software which conceals the identity
     of a message's author.  Use within an echo is up to the moderator of
     that echo.

     However, an AR should not be used in an echo until the echo's
     moderator has informed the operator of the AR that such messages would
     be welcome. The burden of proof that such a request has been granted
     is carried by the operator of the AR.


      4.8  Emergency Plans
     ----------------------

     The Tier 1 Z1B Hubs maintain emergency backup plans should one of
     them experience problems.  These plans include:

         1)  Quick availability of replacement equipment.

         2)  Adequate backups of necessary control information.

         3)  Standby nodes capable of assuming the load.

         4)  Alternate routing to bypass a down Tier 1 Z1B Hub.
