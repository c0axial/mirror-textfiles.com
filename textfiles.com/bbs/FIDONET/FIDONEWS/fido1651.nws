     It's strange what can border on contraversy.  We've argued on Fido
     about our Coordinators, about our mail movers, about those who have
     turned internet technology to Fido's advangage, about those who
     haven't...

     But in the last week we've come dangerously close to tramping on
     icons - at least one particular icon held dear in the United States.
     Ol'WDB passed on a call from some writer to honer the American
     Soldier for his part in helping defend the country so we may all
     enjoy Christmas.  The image this invokes in most of us here in the
     US - that of young men in the prime of their life being asked to
     interrupt their lives, leave their wives and children and family, to
     fight on foreign soil - has got to be confusing to those of another
     culture.  The article prompted at least one confused response
     wondering if Jesus was American and what did the American
     Servicement - the GI - have to do with Christmas.

     Okay... it's tough to explain these days.  During the two World
     Wars, the US entery into battle was delayed and reluctant... and
     wiedly approved by our allies.  But our entry into the Korean War
     was not so widely regarded - and in Viet Nam we had our rear ends
     beat by what was supposed to be an inferior force.  Though we didn't
     treat our returning veterans well as they returned from these
     unpopular war, and barely acknowledged those who didn't return, it
     was tough to ignore the sacrifice they'd made forever.

     I've heard all the stories about the atrocities committed by some
     who wore the GI's uniform, and even share the reservations of some
     who question our involvment in recent skirmishes... but if you don't
     mind, I'll still honer the icons.  There's no greater pastime than a
     major league baseball game, no more perfect meal than a hot dog
     topped off by a piece of Mom's apple pie, no vehicle that can
     outperform the ol' 57 Chevy (once it's properly tuned, of course),
     and no greater hero than the American fighting man who has risked
     his life that the rest of us can take our freedom for granted.

       This year will be the first full moon to occur on the winter
       solstice, Dec. 22, commonly called the first day of winter in, 133
       years.  Since a full moon on the winter solstice occurs in
       conjunction with a lunar perigee (point in the moon's orbit that
       is closest to Earth).  The moon will appear about 14% larger than
       it does at apogee (the point in its elliptical orbit that is
       farthest from the Earth).  Since the Earth is also several million
       miles closer to the sun at this time of the year than in the
       summer, sunlight striking the moon is about 7% stronger making it
       brighter.  Also, this will be the closest perigee of the Moon for
       the year since the moon's orbit is constantly deforming.  If the
       weather is clear and there is a snow cover where you live, it is
       believed that even car headlights will be superfluous.

       On December 21, 1866, the Lakota Sioux took advantage of this
       combination of occurrences and staged a devastating retaliatory
       ambush on soldiers in the Wyoming Territory.

       In laymen's terms it will be a super bright full moon, much more
       than the usual AND it hasn't happened this way for 133 years!

       Our ancestors 133 years ago (1866) saw this.  Our descendants 100
       or 200 or so years from now will see this again.

       I hope someone else might find this interesting!  Remember this
       will happen December 22, 1999.

     A Proposed new Structure for Fidonet
     by John H. Guillory (1:3807/1 john.guillory@mainline.nu)

     There has been a lot of talk recently over various changes to
     fidonet.  Many sugest we should not be bound to zone mail hours,
     some have commented that with the majority of fidonet getting their
     netmail and echo mail via internet, the need to be grouped via
     region is not needed as badly.  Granted, we can't just throw all
     nodes in 1 zone/region/network, because then the NC would have a
     nightmare keeping up with everything, and the RC and ZC wouldn't
     have anything to do.  An option I have been thinking about lately
     would be to group BBS's via Common Intrest.  Rather than break
     fidonet by a sudden change, I say create a few extra zones, eg.
     Zones 7-9, which would then be known as the Common Intrest Zones.

     Zone 7 could be defined as the Amature BBS's (I know, Fidonet is an
     amature Network, and as such all BBS's should be amature, but by
     amature here, I mean any BBS that does not fit into zones 8 or 9).
     FIDONEWS 16-51               Page 3                   20 Dec 1999


     Zone 8 would be defined as the Business/Support Zone.  Groups in
     this zone would include the Binkley Term Support Board, IREX
     Support, FMail Support, Portal Support, etc.  The Region would
     define the type of support, Network would define the product.  Any
     additional support boards/distribution boards, etc. would be listed
     under the network for the product.  Such that if I was looking for
     the latest version of Portal of Power, I could be guaranteed to find
     it by looking in Zone 8, in the Mailer Region, under the Portal
     Network on any of the BBS's within that network.  (It should become
     clear here what the intentions of this are).  Any product who's
     programmers offers support via Fidonet would be listed in Zone 8.

     Zone 9 could be for Non-Profiet Organizations, if there's any left
     in fidonet.

     Within Zone 7, we'd have Regions broken down by main Intrest with
     networks being a sub-intrest.  Eg. Suppose I'm looking for some MIDI
     files, I could then go to Zone 7, Multi-Media Region, MIDI Network,
     and find a list of BBS's that specialize in MIDI files.

     The way I see it, we are loosing many Fidonet BBS's on a regular
     basis, and many have stated they will pull the plug on or before
     Dec. 31, 1999 due to lack of callers.  We need to help the users
     find the BBS's they want in order to save whats left of fidonet, and
     change the direction back to a Growing Network.  Imagine sysop's
     providing BBS listings to the users based on primary features of the
     BBS's.  We could also have online doors that let the users browse
     the nodelist for other BBS's.  Another benefit to this is that the
     BBS's who share a common intrest tend to communicate with each other
     more frequently.  By sharing the same Net number, many BBS's would
     require the users to only enter the Node number of the BBS.  It'd be
     that much quicker and easier for the users to communicate with other
     users via netmail in common intrest networks.  It's just something
     I've been thinking about, and wanted to post in fidonews for others
     to ponder and post their opinions.

     Rumor has it that in less than two weeks, the Internet will fall
     from the sky and it will be the end of civilization as we know it.
     And it's all because computers can't count past 2000, I'm told.
     Like many sysops, I've known all along that I should be preparing
     for these momentous events by buying a new computer, upgrading all
     my software, and adjusting my attitude.

     Somewhere along the way, the system fell apart for me... I never
     knew quite what to do.  I learned a few simple tests I could run on
     my system to tell if it would work in the year 2000... and then
     heard that it may not work even if the tests work.  I've learned
     FIDONEWS 16-51               Page 4                   20 Dec 1999


     that much of the software designed for Fidonet won't work in the
     year 2000, but then I learned that the software I was going to
     replace it with wouldn't work either.

     The information has been so bad that I've simply taken a fatalistic
     attitude... I'll wait until after Y2K and see what's busted.  It's
     not a bad approace:  rumor has it that I won't be able to use my
     hardware or software, so anything I can actually use is a bonus.
     I'm not due for any disappointment using this approach.

     But in his regional echoes and in the Z1C echo, Darrell Salter has
     taken a more ambitious approach and is actually discussing operating
     systems and software.  I don't know how accurate all of it is, but
     if you're not content to stick your head in the sand and wait for
     what Y2K brings, here's some information.

     Y2K INFORMATION FOR FIDONET SYSOPS
     ==================================

     Note: As this database fills out we should come up with a pretty
     good idea of what is, and isn't Y2K compliant. Please notify me of
     any errors or additions to the following list. If you are unsure
     about a piece of software you are running, notify me and it will be
     added to the list, and perhaps someone can notify us of it's Y2K
     compliancy. By all means, please contact the software's author to
     verify.

     Sysops may download Fidonet related Y2K programs, updates, and
     patches from my BBS or by surfing to my web site at
     http://sparkys.dyndns.org and going to the Y2K section of the File
     Archives. ftp://sparkys.dyndns.org also works.

      Thank you, for scuff marks, crayon marks and smelly tennis shoes,
      for they mean we are active.
      Thank you, God, for loud stereos and busy telephones. For they

      And I would like to thank you, Lord, for those unmade beds.
      They are so warm and comfortable. I know that many have no bed.
      My thanks to you, Lord, for this bathroom, complete with all the
      splattered  mirrors, soggy, grimy towels and dirty lavatory, they
      are so convenient.
      Thank you for this finger smudged refrigerator that needs
      defrosting so badly. It has serve us faithfully for many years. It
      is full of cold drinks and enough leftovers for two or three meals.
      Thank you, Lord for this oven that absolutely must be cleaned
      today. It has baked so many things over the years.
      The whole family is grateful for that tall grass that needs mowing,
      the lawn that needs raking; we all enjoy the yard.
      Thank you, Lord, even for that slamming screen door. That means

      Lord, the presence of all these chores awaiting me,
      say You have richly blessed my family.
      I shall do them cheerfully and I shall do them gratefully.
      Thank you, God, for just plain ordinary days-

                               Santa Statistics
                              Thanks to Roy Reed
                               rcreedv@juno.com
     FIDONEWS 16-51               Page 13                  20 Dec 1999


        1.  There are approximately two billion children
        (persons under 18) in the world.  However, since Santa
        doesn't visit children of Muslim, Hindu, Jewish, or
        Buddhist religions, this reduces the workload for
        Christmas night to 15% of the total, or 378 million
        (according to the Population Reference Bureau).  At an
        average (census) rate of 3.5 children per house, that
        comes to 108 million homes, presuming that there is at
        least one good child in each.

        2.  Santa has about 31 hours of Christmas to work
        with, thanks to the different time zones and the
        rotation of the earth, assuming he travels from east
        to west (which seems logical).  This works out to
        967.7 visits per second.

        This is to say that for each Christian household with
        a good child, Santa has around 1/1000 of a second to
        park the sleigh, hop out, jump down the chimney, fill
        the stockings, distribute the remaining presents under
        the tree, eat whatever snacks have been left for him,
        get back up the chimney, jump into the sleigh, and get
        on to the next home.  Assuming that each of these 108
        million stops is evenly distributed around the globe
        (which, of course, we know to be false, but will
        accept for the purposes of our calculations), we are
        now talking about 0.78 miles per household; a total
        trip of 75.5 million miles, not counting bathroom
        stops or breaks.  This means that Santa's sleigh is
        moving at 650 miles per second -- 3,000 times the
        speed of sound.
        For purposes of comparison, the fastest man-made
        vehicle, the Ulysses space probe, moves at a pokey
        27.4 miles per second.  A conventional reindeer can
        run (at best) 15 miles per hour.

        3.  The payload of the sleigh adds another interesting
        element.  Assuming that each child gets nothing more
        than a medium sized lego set (2 pounds), the sleigh is
        carrying over 500,000 tons, not counting Santa
        himself. on land, the conventional reindeer can pull
        no more than 300 pounds.  Even if we grant that the
        "flying" reindeer could pull 10 times the normal
        amount, the job couldn't be done with 8 or even 9 of
        them - Santa would need 360,000 of these
        mega-reindeer.  This increases the payload, not
        counting the weight of the sleigh, by another 54,000
        tons, or roughly 7 times the weight of the Queen
        Elizabeth (the ship, not the monarch).

        4.  600,000 tons traveling at 650 miles per second
        creates enormous air resistance - this would heat up
        the reindeer in the same fashion as a spacecraft
        re-entering the earth's atmosphere.  The lead pair of
        reindeer would absorb 14.3 quintllion joules of energy
        per second each.  In short, they would burst into

        flames almost instantaneously, exposing the reindeer
        behind them and creating deafening sonic booms in
        their wake.  The entire reindeer team would be
        vaporized within 4.26 thousandths of a second, or
        right about the time Santa reached the 5th house on
        the trip.  Not that it matters, however, since Santa,
        as a result from accelerating from a dead stop to 650
        miles per second in .001 seconds would be subjected to
        centrifugal forces of 17,500 g's.  A 250 pound Santa
        (which seems ludicrously slim) would be pinned to the
        back of the sleigh by 4,315,015 pounds of force,
        instantly crushing his bones and organs and reducing
        him to a quivering blob of pink goo.

        5.  Therefore, if Santa did exist, he's dead now.

        Merry Christmas!
