Editorial: None

by Tom Jennings (1:1/1)

None? Well, smaller than usual. Fewer than usual fires this issue too.
(Unless you consider the rather huge fire in the Berkeley/Oakland hills
today... apparently visible from a geosync weather sattelite...)

Alas, another issue chock-unfull of interesting articles of interest to
FidoNet users...

The WorldPol Project
4:4/50@FidoNet

INTRODUCING WORLDPOL VERSION 2B

As it was announced previously, the new version of WorldPol has
now been released. WorldPol 2b contains changes to version 2
proposed by individual sysops around the world through net-mail.

Beginning now, the WORLDPOL echo is available to propose and
debate future changes to WorldPol. The WORLDPOL echo is currently
being distributed in Zones 1 and 4, and we hope to add new zones
in the near future.

The WORLDPOL echo is being distributed via the Independent
Distribution System (IDS) and is currently available at:

Zone 1: nodes 128/77, 133/411, 142/928, 157/603, 250/99 and
273/909.

Zone 4: node 900/202 and the Zone-4 official distribution
backbone.

Please contact any of the aforementioned nodes to get a feed of
WORLDPOL. If you are in another zone and are willing to
distribute WORLDPOL in your zone, please contact 1:102/631 for
more details.

Here is the current release of WorldPol:


                        W o r l d P o l
             The FidoNet Worldwide Policy Document

                    Version 2b, 14 Oct 1991


This Worldwide Policy document has been released for vote by the
members of FidoNet and is not yet in force.


1 FidoNet

This document establishes an international (inter-zonal) policy
for sysops who are members of the FidoNet organization of
bulletin board systems worldwide.  FidoNet is defined by a list
of nodes (NodeList) issued on a weekly basis by each of the Zone
Coordinators, on behalf of the International Coordinator.

FidoNews 8-42                  Page 4                      21 Oct 1991


A node is understood to be a "member system" of FidoNet. The
collection of nodes is classified into Zones, Regions and
Networks.

Each FidoNet Zone is entitled to issue its own policy document,
according to its own needs and customs. This International Policy
determines general rules which must be specified, and may
not be contradicted by, the Zone Policies.

Regions and Networks may also issue their own policies according
to the provisions stated on the corresponding Zone Policy.


1.1 Overview

FidoNet is an amateur electronic mail system. As such, all of its
participants and operators are unpaid volunteers. From its early
beginning in 1984, as a few friends swapping messages back and
forth mainly in North America, it consists now of an
International community of more than ten thousand systems all
over the world.

FidoNet is not a common carrier or a value-added service network
and is a public network only in as much as the independent,
constituent nodes may individually provide public access to the
network via their system.

FidoNet exists to provide electronic mail services to its
member sysops. To efficiently provide such services, various
structure and control mechanisms are essential. The structure is
organized into multiple nets, with decentralized administration.

This document delineates all of the procedures at the
international level of FidoNet, as well as some general rules for
the lower levels (intra-zonal), developed to manage the network.

Authorities in the international level not defined by this
document, shall be defined by the Zone Coordinators Council and
the International Coordinator.


2 Language

Each zone has the right to determine its own official language.

At the international (inter-zonal) level, for practical purposes,
FidoNet adopts English as its official language. All the FidoNet
documents issued at the international level must exist in
English. Translation into other languages is encouraged.


FidoNews 8-42                  Page 5                      21 Oct 1991


3 Admittance to FidoNet

FidoNet membership is open to everyone fulfilling the technical
standards described on a document released by the network's
Technical Standards Committee (FTS-0001 at this writing).
Lower-level policies may issue additional restrictions only if
specifically authorized by the Zone Coordinator Council.


3.1 Anti-discrimination Policy

Discrimination is strictly forbidden within FidoNet.
This means that any type of restriction imposed to a member of
the network that has no technical justification is illegal and
unacceptable.

No technical requisites will be demanded to any member of the
network than those specifically authorized by this or lower-level
policy documents.


4 Organization

The organizational structure of FidoNet has been developed to
distribute the administration and control of FidoNet to the
lowest possible level, while still allowing for coordinated
action over the entire system.

Effective administration is made viable by operating in a
top-down manner. This means that a person at any given level is
responsible to the level above, and responsible for
administrating the level below.

If a person at any level above sysop is unable to properly
perform their duties, the person at the next level may replace
them temporarily, until new elections are held.  For example, if
a Region Coordinator fails to perform, the Zone Coordinator may
cause the Coordinator to be replaced.

Coordinators may also be removed by a majority vote of the level
below. For example, if network Coordinators in a region lose
faith in the ability of a Region Coordinator to effectively
perform, they may vote to have a new Coordinator elected.


4.1 Zone Coordinator Council

The Zone Coordinator Council (ZCC) consists of the Zone
Coordinators and the International Coordinator.

Each Zone Coordinator has one vote at the ZCC. The International
Coordinator may only vote in the event of a ZCC vote tie, but
does not regularly have voting power.

FidoNews 8-42                  Page 6                      21 Oct 1991


The Zone Coordinator Council is the legislative body of FidoNet,
it represents each of the zones in FidoNet. It is the highest
authority of the network's Top-Down organization.


4.2 International Coordinator

The International Coordinator (IC) is the Executive Officer of
FidoNet and coordinates the joint production of the master
nodelist by the Zone Coordinators. The International Coordinator
is responsible for creating new zones in FidoNet, but can only do
so with the approval of a simple majority of the members of the
Zone Coordinator Council.

The International Coordinator is selected by unanimous vote of
the Zone Coordinators, and removed by a majority vote of the Zone
Coordinators. In the case of absence of the International
Coordinator, the Zone Coordinator Council replaces her/him by
voting on all IC resolutions to be approved by a simple majority.


4.3 Zones and Zone Coordinators

A zone is a defined geographic area containing one or many
regions, covering one or more countries.

The Zone Coordinator is the Executive Officer of the Zone, and
the zone's representative to the other zones.

The Zone Coordinator compiles the nodelists from all of the
regions in the zone, creates a master nodelist and a difference
file, which is then distributed over FidoNet within the zone. A
Zone Coordinator does not perform message-forwarding services for
any nodes in the zone, whereas the Zone Coordinator is
responsible for the formation and/or administration of one or
more zone-gates to provide inter-zone mail facilities.

The method used for selection of Zone coordinators is left to
the  discretion of the relevant Zone Policy.  In the absence of a
Zone Policy selection method, Zone Coordinators are elected and
removed by a simple majority vote of the Region Coordinators in
the Zone.


4.4 Regions and Region Coordinators

A Region is a defined geographic area containing nodes which
may or may not be combined into networks. A typical Region will
contain many nodes in networks, and a few independent nodes which
are not part of the network.

FidoNews 8-42                  Page 7                      21 Oct 1991


The Region Coordinator maintains the list of independent nodes in
the region, and accepts nodelists from the Network Coordinators
in the Region. These are compiled to create a regional nodelist,
which is sent to the Zone Coordinator. A Region Coordinator is
encouraged to perform message-forwarding services for nodes
within the region, but is not forced to, unless the appropriate
Zone or Region policy imposes such a requirement.

The method used for selection of Regional coordinators is left to
the discretion of the relevant Zone or Region Policy.  In the
absence of such a policy selection method, Region Coordinators
are elected and removed by a simple majority vote of the Ncs in
the Region.


4.5 Networks and Network Coordinators

A network is a group of nodes, normally but not exclusively in a
local geographic area. Networks coordinate their mail activity to
decrease cost.

The Network Coordinator is responsible for maintaining the list
of nodes for the network, and for forwarding netmail sent to
members of the network from other FidoNet nodes. The Network
Coordinator may make arrangements to handle outgoing netmail, but
is not required to do so, unless the appropriate Zone, Region or
Net policy imposes such a requirement.

The Network Coordinator is responsible for assigning each and
every petitioner within her/his own geographic area a valid node
number within 10 days. A node application can solely be rejected
on technical grounds and if that is the case the petitioner and
the rest of the local network must be informed by the NC of the
requirements that will allow the node number to be assigned.

The method used for selection of Network coordinators is left to
the discretion of the relevant Zone/Region/Net Policy.  In the
absence of such a policy selection method, Network Coordinators
are elected and removed by a simple majority vote of the Nodes in
the Network.

4.5.1  Network Routing Hubs


Network Routing Hubs exist only in some networks. They may be
appointed by the Network Coordinator, in order to assist the
management (especially routing tasks) of the network.


4.6 Individual systems (Nodes)

FidoNews 8-42                  Page 8                      21 Oct 1991


The smallest subdivision of FidoNet is the individual system,
corresponding to a single entry in the nodelist. The system
operator (SysOp) formulates a policy for running the board and
dealing with the users. The sysop must mesh with the rest of the
FidoNet system to receive and send mail, and the local policy
must be consistent with other levels of FidoNet.


4.6.1 Points

A point is a system that is not in the nodelist, but communicates
with FidoNet through a node defined to as bossnode.

A point operator is generally regarded in the same manner as a
node operator, but does not have right to vote and shares
responsibility of her/his actions with her/his bossnode.

The bossnode operator is responsible for all mail originating at
the point. All mail sent to a point is addressed to the
bossnode's address.

A point operator is granted full rights under this policy
document as an associate of the bossnode operator listed on the
nodelist, being the bossnode operator also liable for all actions
performed by the point operator.


4.6.2 Users of an individual system

The sysop is responsible for the actions of any user when they
affect the rest of FidoNet (i.e. if the user is annoying, the
sysop is annoying). The users have no rights under this policy
document.


4.7 The FidoNet Technical Standards Committee

The FidoNet Technical Standards Committee, abbreviated as the
FTSC, exists for the purpose of establishing minimum requirements
in software and hardware to be able to interface with FidoNet.

These minimum requirements must be obeyed at every level.  Nodes
not meeting these requirements are ineligible for a node number
(see section 5.9).  These requirements are subject to change at
any time by the FTSC.


5 General Procedures for All Coordinators


5.1 Making Available Difference Files and Nodelist

FidoNews 8-42                  Page 9                      21 Oct 1991


Each Coordinator is responsible for obtaining and making
available for file request, on a weekly basis, nodelist
difference files and complete nodelists.


5.2 Making Available FidoNews Documents

FidoNews is the Official Newsletter of FidoNet.  Each
Coordinator is responsible for obtaining and making available
for file request on a weekly basis, FidoNews Documents.

This requirement may be waived in the event that a majority of
the Sysops served by the Coordinator have no desire to read or
receive FidoNews.

If a Zone Coordinator is not able to get FidoNews into her/his
Zone, he should immediately request help from the FidoNews
Editor. If the Editor can arrange a way to have it delivered to
the Zone Coordinator, FidoNews must be necessarily available to
the rest of the Zone. Otherwise, the Zone Coordinator may
unilaterally waive this requirement.


5.3 Processing Nodelist Changes and Passing Them Upstream

Each Coordinator is responsible for obtaining nodelist
information from the level below, processing it, and passing the
results to the level above.  The timing of this process is
determined by the requirements imposed by the level above.


5.4 Ensure the Latest Policy is Available

A Coordinator is responsible for making the current version of
the International Policy available to the level below, and to
encourage familiarity with it.


5.5 Minimize the Number of Hats Worn

Coordinators are persuaded to limit the number of FidoNet-related
Coordinator functions they perform. A Coordinator who holds two
different positions, compromises the appeal process. For example,
is the Network Coordinator is also the Region Coordinator, sysops
in that network are denied one level of appeal.

Multiple hats are also discouraged due to the difficulty of
replacing services when a coordinator leaves the net.


5.6 Be a Member of the Area Administered

FidoNews 8-42                  Page 10                     21 Oct 1991


A Coordinator must be a member of the area administered. This is,
a Network Coordinator must be a member of the network s/he is to
coordinate. A Region Coordinator must be either a member of a
network in the region, or an independent in a region.


5.7 Encourage New Sysops to Enter FidoNet

A Coordinator is encouraged to operate a public bulletin board
system which is freely available for the purpose of distributing
Policy and Nodelists to potential new sysops. Dissemination of
this information to persons who are potential FidoNet sysops is
important to the growth of FidoNet, and Coordinators should
encourage development of new systems.


5.8 Tradition, Precedent and Technical Management

A Coordinator is not bound by the practices of predecessor.
However, it must be clear that Coordinators are bound by all
requirements of this document, both as FidoNet sysops and as
Coordinators. The holding of a Coordinator title does not grant
license to annoy others or to flaunt policy.

The primary responsibility of any Coordinator is technical
management of network operations. Decisions should normally be
made only on technical grounds. A Coordinator has the
responsibility to act as objectively as possible; objectivity
must be considered an essential factor when making a decision.


5.9 Exclusivity of Zone Mail Hour

Zone Mail Hour is the heart of FidoNet, as this is when network
mail is passed between systems.  Any system which wishes to be a
part of FidoNet must be able to receive mail during this time
using the protocol defined in the current FidoNet Technical
Standards Committee publication (FTS-0001 at this writing).  It
is permissible to have greater capability (for example, to
support additional protocols or extended mail hours), but the
minimum requirement is FTS-0001 capability during this one hour
of the day.

This time is exclusively reserved for netmail.  Many phone
systems charge on a per-call basis, regardless of whether a
connect, no connect, or busy signal is encountered.  For this
reason, any activity other than normal network mail processing
that ties up a system during ZMH is considered annoying behavior.
User (BBS) access to a system is prohibited during ZMH.

Zone Mail Hour will be defined by each Zone Policy. In the
absence of a Zone Policy, it will be defined by the Zone
Coordinator.

FidoNews 8-42                  Page 11                     21 Oct 1991


Zone Mail Hours for all zones should be published every week in
FidoNews, as well as in the nodelist.


6 Election and Referendum Procedures

Any election or referendum at any level of FidoNet must comply
with the standards described in this chapter.


6.1 Democratic Qualities of the Election

All sysops in FidoNet have a vote and must be allowed to
participate in an election or referendum.

All sysops in FidoNet are entitled to be candidates to any
elective position, provided that the requirements for each
position described on this and lower-level policy documents are
satisfied.


6.2 Particular election mechanisms

Each zone will issue its own election procedures, which may
involve direct participation or indirect participation (electoral
college approach).

In any case, all the sysops in the zone must be allowed to vote.
In the case of an indirect elections, the electors must be chosen
by direct vote of the sysops.


6.2.1 Coordinators acting as Electors

Coordinators will automatically be qualified as electors
representing their network or region in an indirect election only
if they have been chosen by direct vote of the sysops in the
administered area.


6.4 Worldwide elections and referendums

In worldwide elections and referendums with the participation of
all zones, the Zone Coordinator Council will determine the
election procedures and whether vote will be direct or indirect.
This will be done in each particular case by form of a ZCC
resolution.


7 Policy Referenda

FidoNews 8-42                  Page 12                     21 Oct 1991


7.1 International Policy

A referendum on International Policy modification is invoked by
the International Coordinator at the direction of a majority of
the Zone Coordinators, or a majority of the Region Coordinators
of all zones, a majority of the Network Coordinators of all
zones, or by one third of all the sysops in all zones.

All the members of FidoNet are entitled to vote on an
International Policy referendum, which is to be held according to
the procedures described by the Zone Coordinator Council before
the election is called.


7.2 Zone Policy

A referendum on Zone Policy modification is invoked by the Zone
Coordinator, by a majority vote of the Region Coordinators in the
zone, by a majority vote of the Network Coordinators in the
zone, or by one third of all the sysops in the zone.

All the members of the zone are entitled to vote on a Zone
Policy referendum, which is to be held according to the
procedures described on the Zone Policy. If such document does
not exist, the procedures will be determined by the Zone
Coordinator with the approval of the Zone Coordinator Council.

The formulation of Region and Network Policy documents is
encouraged, and must be regulated by the Zone Policy documents in
each zone.


7.3 Transition to a 'Worldwide Policy environment'

After the approval of this Worldwide Policy, the previously
existing policy will still be in effect for the Zone level until
the approval of a new Zone policy, according to the methods
provided in this document.

All the procedures introduced by this Worldwide Policy document
adjourn the procedures existing in the previous policy document.


8 Resolution of Disputes

The FidoNet judicial philosophy can be summed up in two rules:

       1) Thou shalt not excessively annoy others.

       2) Thou shalt not become excessively annoyed.

FidoNews 8-42                  Page 13                     21 Oct 1991


The parties involved in a dispute are encouraged to solve their
problems directly, without the intervention of a Coordinator.


8.1 Mediation Requests

Any of the parties involved may request the intervention of the
respective Coordinator: Network Coordinator if a dispute between
members of the same network, Region Coordinator if a dispute
between members of different networks on the same region; Zone
Coordinator if a dispute between members of different regions on
the same zone; International Coordinator if a dispute between
members of different zones.

The Coordinator requested to act as "mediator" will ask each
party to provide all information relevant to the request within
two weeks from the request being made and will make a decision
within forty-five days after s/he received all the information
from the involved parties.

A Coordinator, unable to resolve a dispute, may name a third
party to act as "mediator," provided the parties involved in the
dispute agree.


8.2 Appeals to a Mediator's Decision

A mediator's decision may be appealed to the immediately superior
level if considered unfair: Region Coordinators handle appeals
from decisions made by Network Coordinators;  Zone Coordinators
handle appeals from decision made by Region Coordinators; the
International Coordinator handles appeals from decisions made by
the Zone Coordinators; and the Zone Coordinator Council will
handle appeals from decisions made by the International
Coordinator, decisions of the Zone Coordinator Council are not
subject to appeal.

For appeals to a decision made by a third person named by a
Coordinator to act as mediator, it will be as if the Coordinator
made the resolution and the previously enumerated sequence of
appealing will be appropriate.

For appealing to a decision made by a mediator, the same terms
and procedures as for any Mediation Request apply.


8.3 Statute of Limitations

A mediation request may not be filed more than 60 days after the
date of discovery of the source of the infraction, either by
admission or technical discovery of the source of an infraction,
either by admission or technical evidence. Mediation requests may
not be filed more than 120 days after the incident, unless they
involve suspected unlawful behavior, in which the legal statute
of limitations of the country involved shall apply.

8.4 Echomail and File Distribution Networks

Each FidoNet Zone is encouraged to establish in it's Zone
Policy, the manner of handling Echomail and File Distribution,
and the resolution of disputes arising from both distributions.

No sysop may be required to carry an echomail conference or a
File Distribution as a condition of joining or remaining in
FidoNet, with the exception of a single restricted traffic
announcement echo used to pass important information to nodes
within a network.

Disclaimer:  I do not run, nor do I intend to run PowerBBS.  I am
simply doing this based upon demand.  - End disclaimer.

There seems to be a growing number of FidoNet systems running PowerBBS.
Since the author of PBBS is a local call to me, and is not a FidoNet
node, I have offered my system as a base point to move a FidoNet
support conference called POWERBBS.

If you want to link into this conference, please contact me at the
above address for a feed.


=============================
Here is the scoop on PowerBBS:
=============================

PowerBBS is a highly advanced BBS System, for DOS and WINDOWS. (The
Only BBS currently available that is a TRUE WINDOWS Application).

Along with the MANY features of PowerBBS, its highly advanced
capabilities, ranks it with that of the top breed.

Such new capabilities, such as true MENU INTERACTION, using arrows have
already been implemented in a new version.

                Basic Features of PowerBBS for Windows

FidoNet technology Support.  FrontDoor (tm) Support.

PowerBBS, CONFIG, & INSTALL Are TRUE Windows Applications Windows
Protocols- Xmodem-1k-G/Ymodem Batch-1k-g/Zmodem

FidoNews 8-42                  Page 16                     21 Oct 1991


Live Programs And Doors Support.  DOS Protocols Support. You can run
DOS doors, OR Windows Doors!

Source code included in package, for producing windows doors using
Turbo Pascal for Windows.  You receive the .TPUs, and instructions on
how to write your own code, making it EASY to write DOORS! OR use
PowerLANG, PowerBBS's script language.

Compatible with PCRelay Software, and the RIME Network (and any other
network using this software).  Also, an exchange program is available
to convert PowerBBS --> Fido --> PowerBBS

CONFIG program is a WINDOWS applications with extensive mouse control,
making it easier than ever to configure PowerBBS for Windows.

Forum support containing its own Message And File Areas. Setup 201
forums.

Professional version is compatible with sharing capabilities, to run
PowerBBS in a network.

Chatting features, between nodes, if you run more than one line.

Full screen visual editor for entering messages.

Forum scanning for only the forums selected by the user.

Download/Upload up to 40 files at once, using PBBSPROT

Search files or messages, by entering a key word.  Search types include
and/or logic.

FULLY CONFIGURABLE MENUS.  Menus can contain built in commands, or
commands you build with PowerLang, a basic type bbs language. You give
each command it's OWN timing sequence.  For example, you can give back
time for using the upload command, or you can take away 2 minutes per 1
minute for a popular feature.

Internal ANSI.SYS Interpreter.  Since it is a WINDOWS program, you do
not need to load this device driver.  This gives PowerBBS more power,
and control.  PowerBBS's WINDOW is now 29 lines long. 25 lines are for
displaying screens, the other is used for USER INFO.

Extensive MACRO language, for text screens and messages.  Such as
|NAME|, which will display the current callers full Name.

WINDOWS MENU and SCROLLING capabilities.  CheckMarking is done for the
TOGGLE Menu.  Other WINDOWS only features, make PowerBBS a WINNER.

Features everything in Windows, with the exception of the Windows only
capabilities.

Includes a COMMERCIAL Fossil INT 14 driver.  Running PowerBBS for DOS
under Multitasking (such as DesqView (tm)), will permit you to run up
to 32 lines on ONE COMPUTER.  Such cards as DigiBoard/Ast, and other
such cards, are ALL SUPPORTED.

There is only ONE charge, no matter how many nodes you set up for the
Dos Version!

Use PBBSPROT for multicard (digiboard/etc) transfers.  Or use DSZ if
you are not sharing IRQs.  Both support up to 40 file transfers at
once.

                ECHONET - QUALITY VS. QUANTITY
                ==============================

Among Fidonet's many offspring, one of the youngest, and
certainly one of the fastest growing, is EchoNet.  Different
from its parent in many ways, it has expanded from tentative
beginnings a little over a year ago at a pace beyond its
founders' wildest dreams.

In the several months that I've been part of EchoNet, I've
noticed the same reaction, time after time, among new sysops
in this rapidly growing family: "Hey! - This Net is really
FRIENDLY!"  At least 19 out of every 20 sysops say this, or
something very much like it, in their first couple or three
posts in ECHO50, the netwide sysop-only conference.

What creates an ambience so friendly that people feel compelled
to remark upon it?  Assuming that at least some of these sysops
know what they're talking about, why is EchoNet so blessed,
when, apparently, other networks aren't? -- It's a question of
focus and direction.

Rather than trying to be "all things to all people," EchoNet is
a private network whose clearly stated purpose is to bring high
quality echoes to BBS Sysops and their users.  All the actions
and policies of the net are geared to it.  This makes for a
stark contrast with the sprawling, sometimes brawling Fidonet,
where the signal to noise ratio in several echoes has passed the
pain threshold.

FidoNews 8-42                  Page 18                     21 Oct 1991


Echonet has no political agendas, no bias, no axes to grind.
There is no "flame" echo, no sex, no foul language, no
"bashing".  In ECHO50, Sysops mostly just relax and chat freely,
or discuss the pros and cons of cost recovery (echoes are free,
though sysops may poll LD for their mail), policy proposals, or
administrative issues regarding the net.

Both sysops and their users talk up a storm in the famous "Free
Spirit" echo, where everything is on topic.  The conversations
are funny or sad, witty, wise, or thought-provoking by turns,
but the common thread of interested, intelligent dialog runs
throughout.  It's all very informal, and the unusually warm
atmosphere has built a camaraderie that is, I guess, not what
folks are used to.

"Software Wars" -- those jolly slanging matches where programs
are demolished rather than discussed -- just don't happen in
EchoNet.  Just when you think something might flare up, a gentle
word or a helpful remark will redirect the heat and flames into
more productive dialog.  This is remarkable to anyone who's
suffered through a few of these "conversations" elsewhere.

Not that EchoNet's conferences are dry, or bland; they aren't.
Discussions in Pros&Cons or Free Spirit are often intense and
fascinating.  Nevertheless, there is no cheap character
assassination or sub-tabloid language to leave permanent scars
on your fine new VGA multi-scanning monitor.  If things appear
to be drifting in that direction, they are gently but firmly put
back on course.

Good order and discipline, in fact, are characteristic of
EchoNet; a game is no game at all without rules, and rules are
of little use when they aren't followed.  EchoNet has achieved a
clear statement of where the boundaries are, what constitutes
good taste and acceptable commentary.  The result is a well-
defined framework, within which everyone can relax, participate,
and feel comfortable.

EchoNet moderators, *Cs and sysops are in close touch with each
other and their users.  The ZEC, Ed Lawyer, is in close touch,
magically, with just about everything going on, and is always
ready to help out where there's a problem.  EchoNet has no
hapless, unsupported moderators, screaming to be heard over the
noise of battle.  Instead, there are well run conferences where
the signal overshadows the noise in ratios to make even the most
fanatic hi-fi buff content.

EchoNet is cheerfully non-democratic (not the same thing as
"undemocratic") and thrives that way.  There is no question as
to who runs the network, and the positions of ZC and ZEC are not
up for grabs.  Within a net, it's who can do best for the
network that determines the choice of NC and NEC.

FidoNews 8-42                  Page 19                     21 Oct 1991


*Cs are not left to sink or swim on their own, either.  ZNTC
John Radford is always available (and, yes, he *does* answer
netmail -- promptly) to smooth out any technical problems with
mailers, mail processors, net topology or routing.  It's all in
the interest of the smooth flow of echomail throughout the net,
and the mail flows very smoothly indeed.  In the sometimes
baffling and frustrating arena of multi-zone nets and echomail,
it is comforting (not to say economical!) to have that kind of
expertise on tap.

From the ZC on down, questions of policy are thoroughly thrashed
out, debated, considered, and voted on.  The folks who have to
carry the burden of decisions have their input to the folks who
have to make those decisions.  The final say-so comes with
the overall purpose of the network firmly in mind, but there is
no question about who writes it into policy.

The effect of all this is a highly participatory atmosphere,
unpolluted by political manoeuvering, hidden agendas, power
plays, and all the other claptrap that seems to come with the
territory in less focused and closely knit communities.

No-one in a coordinator position in EchoNet forgets that the
position has more responsibilities than it has (mostly
imaginary) privileges.  Besides, a *C trying to ride roughshod
over the "grunt" sysops in his/her net would be brought back in
line pretty quickly.  On the other hand, a sysop or user
spreading dissension and upset in the name of "free speech"
doesn't last long, so the atmosphere stays tranquil, and
everyone can get on with enjoying the hobby.

Sensation mongers (those seething malcontents who seem to enjoy
sucking half of an echo's participants into an off topic
people-roast while the other half goes away in despair) don't
get started, or quickly drift off in search of easier game.

EchoNet proves that sex, drugs, and malediction can be left out
of debates, and communication will flow in more and more
interesting, enticing, and (hey, whaddaya know!) thoroughly
enjoyable directions.  It's growing at a remarkable rate, and,
perhaps most surprising of all, the "family atmosphere" that
characterised it in the early days has not been diluted.  That
in itself is a remarkable tribute to the people who make the net
what it is.

Information on EchoNet and how to apply for membership can be
obtained by file-request, using the magic name "ENETSYS" or
"KIT" from 1:3603/230, 1:261/3000, 1:261/1056, or 1:261/1083.

Auto Racing Echo

I have been a member of FidoNet now for almost 5 years. I have
imported or have seen many echo areas that deal with many
different issues, and interests. All except one, Auto Racing.

I have been an enthusiast of auto racing my whole life and when some
of my users started asking me to start an area for them to talk about
auto racing I decided to attempt to get it on to the backbone. I'm
sure there are more enthusiasts that would appreciate an echo like
this.

If you or any of your users have any interest in this echo, Please ask
your coordinator for information on it. It is called AUTORACE and is
on the ELIST.

Wind up your Computer!  The DR_DEMENTO echo is here!

- - -
In the year of nineteen seventy,
Underneath the old Smogberry Tree,
First was heard a man that we all know,
The one and only Doctor Demento...

--Barnes and Barnes, with "Weird Al" Yankovic in the Dr. Demento
  15th Aniverssary Song
- - -
YeS!  It'S FiNaLlY hErE!  The Dr. Demento Discussion echo!  For you
peoples who wanted to talk about the most demented person on the radio
waves today, now you have an echo for it!!  Talk about the one who
brought the craziness back into the Radio world, when it was drab!
Now you can talk all you want about history of the show, The Doctor
himself, the demented songs that are played, or should be played on
his Radio Show, the lyrics to those songs, or you can tell the peoples
in your neighborhood which station carries The Dr. Demento Show!

SysOps, if you or your users want to try it out for a test run, do so
by Netting me between the hours of 10pm - 7am, Pacific Standard time
at Address of 1:203/19, or Jeff Grimmet, at 1:202/1005, at 24 Hours a
day.  Just try it.  If you don't like it, you can stop the feed. (Just
check with your users to see if they want it still, or they might
revolt into a state of `demented'ness and play havoc with your board!
:) )

"...and Don't Forget to Staaaaaay Deeeeeemented!"

By Matthew Landry, Moderator, NYBBS - 1:267/109
Of Interest to Hobbyist Sysops

Of note to those of you who follow BBS and Telecommunications
legislation is a new echo started in New York by the New York State
Bulletin Board Society.
NYBBS attempts to follow stories of interest to sysops and non-sysops
alike as well as encouraging lobbying activities to promote the welfare
of hobbyist telecommunications.
Our topics are not limited by geography as one states actions are sure
to be looked at in other states.
The main topic of this echo is the discussion of hobbyist
telecommunications. The NYBBS is very effective in
monitoring pending legislation, litigation and other topics that
affect our hobby.

As a new echo it is not listed on the backbone yet, but is requestable
from 1:13/13 and will be listed in the next Elist.
I encourage anyone who may be interested, or may be
able to further the goals of the echo to become involved.

Thanks, and I hope to see ya' there!    Matthew Landry
