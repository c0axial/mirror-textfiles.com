        We seem to be getting alot of press these days, mostly bad.

        The latest story I've heard is about a bunch of kids in New 
        Jersey who hacked away at a Pentagon computer.  They don't 
        seem to have caused any harm, just made general nuisances of 
        themselves, but the media had a field day.

        I saw a news broadcast on one of the New York stations where 
        they interviewed a Pentagon official about it.  He firmly 
        stated that there is no way any hacker can do any real harm 
        (the reporter was concerned about kids getting control of 
        satellites).  Having studied Naval Intelligence, I know he's 
        right.  Government systems holding confidential data DO NOT 
        have phone lines!  This is nothing new; confidential 
        information is never transmitted by phone.

        Once the reporter established that these kids were basically 
        harmless, she went on to cover some "background" about home 
        computers, modems, phone lines, and so forth.  This mainly 
        consisted of a short piece on remote bulletin board systems.

        In fact, they actually demonstrated a person logging onto a 
        bulletin board.  And, here's the cute part, the Fido doggie 
        was plain as day.  Now, maybe I'm biased, but it strikes me 
        that Fidonet is the cleanest collection of boards in the 
        country.  

        She wrapped up her whole piece by stating that while she 
        didn't see anything illegal or immoral on the system she was 
        looking at, that didn't mean it wasn't there, since there 
        are different levels of access and not everyone sees 
        everything.

        Nice, eh?  She didn't say anything that wasn't true, but the 
        way she said it implies secret cabals of subversive 
        criminals, conspiring to overthrow The American Way Of Life.

        Face it, kiddos.  The powers that be don't like us.  Here we 
        are, with unprecidented powers of communication, and nobody 
        really knows what we can or will do with it.  We have 
        nothing less than our own private electronic mail system.  I 
        can sit here in my own little room and contact thousands of 
        (more or less) like-minded people all over the country.  You 
        may not beleive it, but this translates into tremendous 
        political power.

        It reminds me of something I was once told about military 
        tactics.  It matters not what they are doing, nor what we 
        think they will do, but only what they CAN do if they want 
        to.  We are seem as being able to do a great deal, possibly 
        much more than we are actually able to do.  And we don't fit 
        any of the established categories.  Just look at where we 
        are:

        o   A guy sits in his room and types a message.  It isn't 
            printed in a newspaper or published in a magazine, but 
            the next day hundreds of people read it.  Within a few 
            weeks thousands of people all over the country have read 
            it.  All of the normal channels of news distribution 
            have been totally bypassed, for a cost counted in 
            pennies.  

        o   A guy writes a program, and gives it away.  Friends pass 
            it on to their friends, and soon it's in use all over 
            the country.  People mail in voluntary donations.  The 
            guy isn't a non-profit organization, or a major 
            corporation, or even a reasonably normal small company, 
            yet he's making money without contracts, without 
            dealers, without even charging anyone for anything.  

        o   A guy goes into business as a consultant.  His startup 
            costs are minimal; less than the cost of a used car.  He 
            has no office, no employees, no inventory, and no 
            overhead, but he makes good money.  

        Now I ask you, how possible was any of this ten years ago?  
        We simply don't fit any of the established categories.  This 
        is a new industry, and it's working in totally different 







FIDONEWS     --           29 Jul 85  00:00:42           Page 3

        ways from anything that's ever come before.

        Which is not to say that nothing new has ever happened; it 
        has many times.  But the normal reaction to new things is to 
        try and shove them into old boxes, or to get rid of them if 
        they won't fit.

        The independant consultant is being shoved into the old 
        boxes.  A bill has been introduced in California that would 
        make an independant consultant legally an employee of his 
        client.  Federal legislation has been proposed to make a 
        consultant's office in the home illegal, and to force 
        consultants to hire only union employees.  Tax rulings that 
        are unfavorable to the independant abound, as many of you 
        well know.

        Bulletin boards won't fit into any established category, 
        though some people are trying.  Classing a bulletin board as 
        a "common carrier" is an attempt to define us in previously 
        understood terms.  Other attempts are a good deal more 
        harmfull, as they sound like an attempt to classify a sysop 
        as an accessory before the fact, and bulletin boards as 
        conspiracies to commit felonies.

        We need to act NOW, before it's too late!  We need to write 
        our senators and representatives and tell them how we feel.  
        We need to set up our own political action group to 
        represent our interests.  We need to make our voices heard.

        You should also write to your local newspapers, television 
        stations, and radio stations telling them that you are 
        willing to provide background on any computer related 
        stories they get.  

        To ban bulletin boards because a few of them are used for 
        hacking is on par with shutting down the phone company 
        because criminals use phones.

        BBSLAW01.MSG   From Chip Berlet, Public Eye Magazine.

                        HELP FIGHT BAD BBS LAWS - 01

           FEDERAL LEGISLATION RESTRICTING BBS OPERATION DUE SOON!

                 POST THIS MESSAGE ON EVERY BBS IN AMERICA!



             A new federal law that would outlaw some BBS systems 
        and severely restrict all others could be passed by Congress 
        in 1985.  A mobilization of SYSOPS and BBS users is urgently 
        needed to ensure we have a chance to speak out on the new 
        law.  

             Watch BBS's for messages with "BBSLAWXX.MSG" headers or 
        "HELP FIGHT BAD BBS LAWS - XX" titles. An ad-hoc group will 
        be posting these messages on BBS's and the commercial 
        systems.  

             LAWMUG SYSOP Paul Bernstein and I have learned the law 
        could be introduced as soon as MID JULY!  Although aspects 
        of the new law have been discussed for months by "experts" 
        in Washington, NOT ONE SYSOP WAS CONSULTED until a June 20 
        conference in Chicago which Paul and I attended.  

             Vague language in another telecommunications law 
        already introduced in Congress might also restrict BBS 
        activities.  

        We urged the Congressional aide involved in that legislation 
        to exempt BBS systems until we could let SYSOPS and lawyers 
        study the language more carefully.  We must also monitor 
        this law.  

             The law restricting BBS operations was prompted by 
        panic over the possibility that children (minors) might read 
        pornographic material, and by the wave of publicity 
        regarding the malicious hackers and illegal credit card and 
        phone information posted on BBS's by electronic graffiti 
        vandals.  

             Among the ideas SERIOUSLY DISCUSSED for the new federal 
        law restricting BBS's are provisions which would require: 

             * Registration of all BBS's as a public utility.  

             * BBS users to log in with, and post their legal names.  

             * SYSOPS to keep a log of all names of users.  

             * SYSOPS to keep a log of all messages & access times.  








FIDONEWS     --           29 Jul 85  00:00:46           Page 5

             * Criminal penalties for SYSOPS whose BBS's have 
               illegal messages posted on them - even if the SYSOP 
               was not aware of the message and had not been 
               informed the message was there nor given a chance to 
               remove it!  

             While the law is currently only being discussed, there 
        is much pressure to restrict and regulate BBS's.  A good BBS 
        law could protect BBS's and SYSOPS.  A bad law could destroy 
        BBS's in their infancy as a telecommunications phenomena.  

             BBS's put the individual back into mass society in the 
        age of telecommunications.  BBS's encourage information 
        sharing and remove barriers to discussion posed by social 
        status, wealth, class, race, sex, physical size, and many 
        physical handicaps.  BBS's encourage the democratic process 
        and are a powerful new communications system which deserves 
        Constitutional protection and First Amendment Rights.  

             NO LEGISLATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION!  There will be 
        differing views of wording, law, and tactics; all should be 
        given a chance to be heard.  Congress should delay passage 
        of any BBS legislation until BBS users and SYSOPS have a 
        chance to discuss the legal issues and make their opinions 
        known in a series of Congressional hearings. Our discussion 
        must start immediately and we must organize to block bad BBS 
        legislation until our voices are heard.  

             We share the responsibility.  Time is short.  Spread 
        the word.  It is the electronic age.  We are all Paul 
        Revere....

        ADDRESSED TO YOUR TWO SENATORS AND CONGRESSMAN.  IF YOU HAVE 
        ANY INTEREST IN PRESERVING YOUR FREEDOM OF SPEECH, I STRONGLY 
        RECOMMEND YOU SIGN AND MAIL OUT COPIES OF THIS LETTER.  

             SPREAD IT AROUND TO ALL THE BBSES YOU CALL - ONLY A FLOOD 
        OF LETTERS TO CAPITOL HILL WILL PROTECT US FROM REACTIONARY 
        LAWS!

        United States _________________

        Washington, DC 

             As a user of a personal computer for telecommunications, 
        and as a member of the new "electronic community," I wish to 
        strongly protest the current proposals for laws regulating 
        electronic Bulletin Board Systems.  

             Recent negative publicity about a few such systems being 
        used to spread illegal long-distance access codes and stolen 
        credit card numbers has cast public doubt on our hobby.  It is 
        time that the record is set straight.  

             Electronic BBSes are the freest form of interpersonal 
        communications ever created.  The people who use them do so as 
        a way of sharing their thoughts, ideas, and information on the 
        rapidly changing computer technology.  Also shared are 
        thoughts and ideas about the world in general; many systems 
        have ongoing debates about National and world issues.  Not 
        since the days of the American Revolution, when thoughts and 
        ideas were first spread around through pamphlets and flyers, 
        has such a system of rapid communication been developed.  

             The vast majority of BBSes and their users are honest 
        people, who use this new technology in their work and as a 
        hobby.  We should not be punished for the illegal actions the 
        few misguided people about whom there has been so much 
        publicity.  

             I therefore recommend that before any laws restricting 
        the use of BBSes are passed, input is received from the 
        operators and users of these systems.  Representation of our 
        interests in promoting the freedom of speech we exercise on 
        the BBSes is the answer to reactionary laws.   I urge you to 
        support our position in this matter.  

        Sincerely,

        ___________________________

                                FIDO Re-Write

                This is a response to Jim Lynn and Paul Kelly who
        wrote an article for the last issue of FIDONEWS about the
        re-write of FIDO.  I guess that I have a basic problem with
        the article in that as far as I know, there is no FIDO
        "re-write committee".  From all of the information that I
        have been able to gather, there are simply a number of
        individuals who have taken it upon themselves to try and
        re-write FIDO.  I don't know of any group that has as yet
        successfully emulated the entire range of FIDO operations.
        I myself have started a re-write project of my own, and so
        far I have about 90% of the message section written and
        working from the console keyboard.  Any sysops interested
        in beta testing this software should call my board at
        (603) 888-8179 and dowload the file 'ROVER.ARC' which is
        the executable program, and some short documentation.

                As far as the ideas presented in the article go, I
        liked them a lot.  The idea of overlays for FIDO is 
        something that I simply never thought of, but now that I
        have thought about it, the question of how to implement it
        arises.  This area would have to be more thoroughly
        explored to see if it is feasible.  I could see FIDO being
        distributed as 2 .OBJ modules, one that would be the inner
        guts of FIDO, and 1 that would be a standard do-nothing
        overlay which could be tailored by each individual sysop
        that had the programming tools necessary to do such a job.

                I would welcome any input from groups that are
        also working on a FIDO re-write.  Perhaps a lot of work
        could be saved by pooling our resources.

        OK....first of all, all you male sysops DON'T FREAK
        OUT!!  I am not a radical feminist....just another Fido
        Sysop who happened to notice there aren't many female
        sysops (in fact, glancing at the latest nodelist...I may
        be it!!)  I haven't seen any bias in Fido regarding
        gender, so Congratulations!!  But, with so many women in
        the computer field, it does seem odd to me that there
        aren't more female sysops.  If I'm overlooking anyone...
        please contact me at 15/1001.  Thanks!!

        Now, my REAL beef--  It seems that lately Fido News has
        been over run with articles about pirating.  A topic
        that is more upsetting to me is "Crackers" and board
        crashers.  In both Albuquerque, NM & Denver, CO, there
        seems to be a recent serious rash of this activity. So
        bad that we have possibly lost a few good sysops.  Node
        104/341 (DASUG) and a great sysop is down due to Trojan
        Horse type programs on his board, and he may not come
        back.  Other non-fido boards in Albuquerque have been
        victimized and may not try putting their boards back up.
        Can't we as Legimate Sysops band together and do
        something about this plague?  We can certainly "turn in"
        pirate boards.  I don't like playing the role of
        "squealer"....BUT, laws are forthcoming on bulletin
        boards and electronic communications, and we need to
        stand up for the legitimate uses and make sure lawmakers
        recognize the difference between "Crackers" & pirates,
        and lawful uses of telecommunication.  

        I would like to know if there is an organization that
        can lobby on behalf of this issue?  This is serious,
        because if we don't stand up for ourselves, no one else
        will!!  Any information on this issue would be greatly

                There is a wonderful, new world out there for 
        communication by PC.  It revolves around references to man's 
        best friend -- Fido!  Like its namesake, Fido can be a 
        worker, a thing of wonder, a fun pastime and a pain in the 
        neck.  Those of you who aren't involved have no idea and to 
        you this article is addressed.  The rest of you are saying 
        "amen!" 

                I never had a pup of my own before Fido.  I couldn't 
        really compare electronic Fido with the flesh and blood kind 
        until I got both about the same time.  PC Fido is much 
        neater in many senses of the word.  Nice people were 
        responsible for both my dogs moving in.  My mother-in-law 
        decided my son needed a pup and Bob Klahn decided my office 
        needed one.  Both folk are tenacious.  I have one dog at 
        home that barks when I call sometimes and a dog at the 
        office that usually will bark at those of you who own 
        modems.  

                Fido was created to help a couple programers keep 
        abreast of their progress on a mutual project.   Strange 
        thing, though -- they were on opposite coasts.  Tom 
        Jennings, our doggy daddy, was in San Francisco and his 
        counterpart was in Baltimore.  Tom fathered Fido so they 
        could compare source code, hence the FidoNet standard time 
        of 1:00 A.M. Pacific time.  From the two original NetMembers 
        we have grown to more than 400 visible nodes.  There are 
        numerous Fido boards, or nodes, that aren't public and can't 
        be enumerated.  Safe to say, there are lots of Fidos out 
        there on which you may use your typing talents.  

                For a public domain program, Fido is well supported.  
        The current version in distribution is 10K, --and there was 
        a version 1.  You will find fleas on Fido from time to time, 
        but the flea powder troops are very active.  Tom Jennings 
        deserves a medal.  This is a long way of saying R* is the 
        most unreliable command in the lexicon.  But, as it says on 
        the Woodstock I album, "treat the imperfections as marks in 
        fine leather -- proof of its authenticity.  

        Anyone can be a Fido Sysop.  You don't have to own a 3088 
        with VMS.  I started my board with a 300 baud Hayes and two 
        floppies for storage.  Bob Klahn came to my office one 
        Saturday afternoon and installed it.  You may wish to 
        download the files to make it run from many of the Fido 
        boards.  If you plan to put it to business use, your 
        software consultant probably can offer some advice or 
        assistance making it fit your hardware configuration.  Fido 
        is a public domain program and nobody should collect money 
        for it, save Tom Jennings.  There are some applications out 
        there that dogfight with Fido and good business practice 
        says you should check with a consultant who knows those 
        conficts.  See me for their names.  It will cost you hourly 
        rates but it's good insurance.  If you want to use it for 
        personal stuff there are countless people who will help you 
        join the throng.  I love it.  I have been known to spend 
        voluntary hours playing with it.  I have also saved DAYS of

        work due to the information that I could receive and send 
        through it.  I have saved weeks of travel time.  One sysop 
        has it trigger a beeper.  He gets out of more lengthy 
        meetings that way.  Another Fido wakes his master and 
        mistress with Bach a la PC.  When Jim Goldschneider set up 
        his Fido, two guys I know made his board exit to DOS at 
        midnight, play him and his wife some classical music, and 
        return to Fido.  I forget their names.  Moral:  be 
        thoughtful of your choice of folk to whom you extend sysop 
        privileges.  And that brings up a thought.  I have seen many 
        try to crash my system.  I have seen no one succeed.  Nor 
        has anybody else.  You can get in.  Only those you allow to 
        do so can get in.  Some sysops do not let anyone in until 
        they are asked first.  And they frequently say no.  Some 
        sysops keep their boards a secret.  It's fun.  It's safe and 
        profitable.  Only conversation, good books and sex rank 
        higher.

        I am trying to find some back issues of FidoNews from  1984.  
        I  have  Vol.  1  #'s  1 and 2,  but am missing the rest for 
        December.  I've been looking around the local boards, but no 
        luck.  If anyone has them (after all this time), or knows of 
        someone who does,  please let me know.  My intent is to keep 
        an on-line archive of all Fido Newsletters.  

        Thanks very much!  Dan Taylor...

                        Correction to National USER LIST

        Bob Hartman
        SYSOP Fido 101/101
        the UN*X Gateway

        For those of you that have received the National FIDO user
        list, there is one small change that you should make.  My
        old node number (it should have been changed the Friday
        before this is published) was 101/10101.  Unfortunately,
        the SHIPUSER program created a file NNNNnnnn.USR where NNNN
        was my net number (0101), and nnnn was my node number, which
        came out as 1010 instead of 10101.  Unlike the FIDO software
        itself, they did not use a hexadecimal representation for
        the net and node numbers, and any node number that was 5
        digits got truncated.  Anyway, to get to the point, my new
        node number is 101/101 (to avoid such problems in the near
        future), and if you have the user list please change all
        occurences of 1010 to 101.
