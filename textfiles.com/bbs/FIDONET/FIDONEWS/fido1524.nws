                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================


     It's interesting to see how things scurry about when light is cast on
     them.

     The vocal minority in one instance, demanding an election, gets
     exactly what it asks for.  What made it all the more interesting is
     that no plan, candidate or proposal was in place by this same vocal
     minority should they achieve their goal...which effectively indicates
     the level of 'deep thinking' that was behind their efforts, which
     have been going on for nearly a year.

     The 'court of public opinion' is only as astute as the lynch mob that
     is behind it...it probably feels great to 'hang the bastard', but...
     then what?  Wait another year, or accept the first hastily-assembled
     plan that they can come up with?

     With regard to last week's editorial, I can only state that readers
     might want to re-read it carefully, and compare the meanings as
     _written_ in opposition to the 'selective quoting' done in at least
     one response to it.  Perhaps you will see that there is a wide
     difference between what you _do_ read, and what you are _told_ as to
     the meaning of what you read.

     In essence, the concern floating about is that the editorials in the
     FidoNews are "too political".  Fortunately, the vast majority seems
     to understand that in a free society, a free press is critical to its
     survival.

     There needs to be someone or something to bring out the 'dark side'
     of the society and without being concerned about censorship, or there
     would be no room for dissent or even difference of opinion...even for
     that group that wants dissent or difference of opinion suppressed.

     Consider what would happen if editorials were 'trimmed' to be
     "politically correct" or "inoffensive".

     And, by the same token, the free press, as we have in FidoNet, must
     also publish what is submitted to it.  The only restriction made is
     that the submissions meet the format criteria...justify left, margin
     of 70 characters, so that the publication software can handle the
     materials.

     To that end, there has been a claim by John Souvestre that the
     FidoNews has refused to publish articles; further, that 'certain
     submissions' are refused acceptance by either NetMail or E-Mail, as
     part of some plan to 'censor' articles that I personally do not agree
     with.

     Such a claim has either one of two purposes...the first, to point out
     that there actually has been censorship.

     To my knowledge, since becoming Editor, there has been none.
     FIDONEWS 15-24               Page 2                   15 Jun 1998


     If there has been, I ask that those who have submitted such articles
     to come forward and present both logs and articles since I have been
     Editor.

     The second purpose, however, is probably the most likely one...to do
     little more than cast doubt on the sanctity of the FidoNews to
     FidoNet, and create controversy where none exists...

     In other words, to play politics as usual, though I will stop short
     of claiming it is to protect his own commercial interests in FidoNet.

     One of the key points in FidoNet is that the process itself should
     never be politicized or commercialized.

     Individuals may be political in their efforts, but the actual
     functions and processes themselves should be above that...such as the
     granting or removal of FidoNet nodes, or the handling of the EchoList
     or EchoMail areas, among others.

     When we allow the control of the EchoList to come under the sway of
     politics, or even be influenced by commercial entities, the idea of
     FidoNet will indeed die off.

     The commercial entities exist because of FidoNet...we do not exist
     because of the commercial entities.

     In other news, several EchoList replacement projects are currently
     in the works, the most public being that of Thom LaCosta
     (1:261/1352).  At present, all projects are in 'testing mode'; I have
     been made aware of two specifically, and I've been reminded as well
     of the effort to hand over all EchoList functions to Zone 2 as part
     of an earlier proposal to merge the Zone 1 and Zone 2 ELIST
     functions, along with Zone 3.

     But perhaps it is time for the various moderators to gather their
     collective thoughts on just *how* an EchoList should be established.

     I would caution the moderators not to demand any specific proposal;
     rather, to suggest reasonable developments within the confines of
     technology and necessity within Fido, as well as rational
     administrative concerns on both sides, lest we see yet another
     imposed administrative plan from persons with 'vested interests'.

     Let's see if cooperation and communication still exist in FidoNet
     before we start pushing weight around.

                           LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
     =================================================================


     Dear Editor, aka Zorch, aka Mark Hernandez, aka Snoopy:

     Your editorials contain as much fiction as fact.  Last week:

     Fact:  Adrian Walker has stepped down as the Z1 EchoList Coordinator.

     Fiction:  Adrian handed over the EchoList or it's source code to me.

     Needless to say, your conclusions are equally flawed.  Get some
     facts!

     Regards,

     John

     RESPONSE TO EDITORIAL IN FIDONEWS DATED 9 JUNE 1998
     By Ben Hamilton, FidoNet 1:124/7008

     This letter is in response to the editorial that was included in the
     FidoNews issue on June 9, 1998.

     The editorial contained several inaccuracies that I would like to
     talk about.  Hopefully, the personal knowledge I have of some of
     the issues will be of more value than the best guesses of the editor.

      > Adrian Walker has stepped down as the Zone 1 EchoList Coordinator,
      > with the June 1998 ECHOLIST being his final publication.  While
      > Adrian is admired for his work, it is odd that he would hand over
      > his source code, long stated as both his own and not to be
      > disclosed, to John Souvestre...

     Not odd at all.  In fact, Adrian, in his message which notified us
     that he was leaving, he praised his working relationship with John.

     To clarify, Adrian handed over only the source code to the Backbone
     Robot, not the Echolist Robot.  The editorial simply says "source
     code," which is misleading.

      > In another odd development, the RECC, in the guise of Ben Hamilton,
      > has cast a 'no confidence' vote against Bob Kohl, the Zone 1
      > EchoMail Coordinator.

     To me, and I'm sure to many folks, the word "guise" implies some sort
     of cover or cloak, and I am wearing none.  I am simply a FidoNet
     sysop, an elected Region Echomail Coordinator, and a member of the
     RECC who has specific personal knowledge of the recent vote of
     confidence that was taken.

     FIDONEWS 15-24               Page 4                   15 Jun 1998


     I speak only for myself.  I am not the spokesperson for the RECC.  I
     do not speak on their behalf.  They were aware that I was posting the
     results of the vote in FidoNews, but they neither assisted in nor
     approved any specific wording in last week's submission.

      > the RECC holding secret meetings and refusing to discuss matters
      > with the ZEC, and other similarly puerile activities, make it odd
      > that Ben and the RECC would not include their 'list of grievances'
      > that they claim would prove their position...in a public setting.

     Much discussion takes place in the RECC Mailing List.  This is a
     mailing list set up with only the current sitting REC's.

     As for a "list of grievances," the ZEC duties that Bob Kohl wrote sum
     it up quite nicely, so there was no reason to include one.

     Again, to quote the relevant section of Kohl's duties:

         >>  If the RECC concludes that the ZEC is not active,  <<
         >>  ineffective in his/her job or is just not taking   <<
         >>  care his/her responsibilities; they may take a     <<
         >>  vote of no-confidence.                             <<

     Careful consideration has been going on for about two months.

     Also, we never refused to discuss this with the ZC.  I think we each
     welcome discussing this with Bob Satti at any time.

      > After all, the RECC posted the vote in public; why _not_ the
      > reasons?

     Again, I speak only for myself.  My submission last week was not done
     on behalf of the RECC.  If I had been speaking on behalf of them, I
     would have said so and signed the message accordingly.

      > Butch effectively disappeared as the OBO after his unilateral
      > declaration that all nodes which distribute EchoMail are under
      > the direct authority of the OBO and the NAB.
      >
      > Strange that the RECC was so deathly silent on that issue, acting
      > as individuals instead of a group...

     There was nothing to say.  What Butch said was his own personal
     opinion.  He is certainly entitled to that.  And that declaration
     did not produce even a fraction of the controversy that continually
     surrounds Bob Kohl.

      > It is hoped that the Z1C sees past the rhetoric and lack of
      > reasoning involved, and directs the RECC to accept mediation...

     We tried mediation for the first month.  You may recall Bob Kohl's
     first act as ZEC:  Advice from the RECC on how to remove an NEC from
     their position.  It went downhill like a snowball headed for Hell from
     there...  Bob Kohl did remove that NEC.  Then he removed an NC.  His
     REC quit, naming Bob Kohl as the reason.  Kohl allows non-approved
     nodelist flags to fly.  He discloses in-transit netmail.  He routes
     FIDONEWS 15-24               Page 5                   15 Jun 1998


     netmails only when the mail includes text that he personally approves
     of, it appears, revoking the routing agreements at will, without
     proper notification of such.  Sysop-level election?  He doesn't even
     believe in holding elections in his own region!

     Region 10 business, frankly, is none of our business.  However, things
     that happen in Region 10 do make it easy to see what can happen when
     the "multiple hats" suggestion in Policy 4 is ignored.

     I considered not responding.  The editor certainly has a way with
     words.  When he turns these around, as I am sure he will, I will be
     back to offer what I'm sure will be a quite different personal
     perspective known as "the truth."

     Again, I speak only for myself.  The views expressed in this letter to
     the editors do not necessarily reflect the views of any other RECC
     members.

     Region 10 Coordinator Election is a Joke!
     by Richard Ratledge 1:119/88 (Region 10) ratledge@jps.net
     Former N119C/N119EC

     6/12/1998 00:50
     I just received an echomail message posted by Brenda Donovan
     which was apparently Bob Satti's (ZEC/IC) instructions on how to
     conduct an election for Region 10 Coordinator. He has given until
     midnight tomorrow (6/13) to submit nominations. After the
     nominees are announced (no date given for that) he is allowing
     only until 6/20 for votes.

     This has to be the quickest election I have ever seen conducted
     in Fidonet. Even our little net elections often took a month to
     complete.

     It appears to me that Bob Satti and Bob Kohl are in cahoots to
     see that a fair election is not held. My only possible guess as
     to why is to ensure that Bob Kohl retains the R10C position.

     I hope I am wrong in my assessment. I will state for the record
     though that if Bob Kohl continues as R10C, I will leave Fidonet.
     This decision is based not only on the fact that Bob Kohl has
     been a major hindrance to the smooth operation of Region 10 but
     now it appears that Bob Satti is condoning BK's actions.

     Region 10 (and Fidonet) has already lost its Regional Echo
     Coordinator because of Bob Kohl's antics. With the way Fidonet is
     being run, it is rapidly losing members. Perhaps I am forseeing
     the worst. I hope a fair, honest, responsible and intelligent
     person is elected R10C even given the unreasonable constraints of
     this election.

     Finally, I have to say that I do appreciate the gesture of
     holding an election. However, I strenuously object to the manner
     in which it is being held.

     Drivin' That Train,
     High on Cheesecake?
     by Gerry Calhoun, 1:2004/200  gerry@petpride.org

     In efforts to resolve ongoing problems in Region 10, by all
     appearances Bob Satti has adorned himself with a new hat. This new
     hat does not look like a traditional Fido one, however. The new hat
     is navy blue with white stripes. He must have received it from
     someone who works for Union Pacific because he is pulling a railroad
     job the likes of which is unheard of in the history of Fido.
     FIDONEWS 15-24               Page 7                   15 Jun 1998


     There has been an election announced for the R10C position. What is
     really astounding though is the election schedule. Less than two
     days for a nomination period and voting by NC's concludes a week
     later. This quick pace sounds like the vote of confidence that Kohl
     spearheaded for Satti in the Z1C position last year. For many I am
     sure it will be much less than two days for a nomination period
     though since I have learned of this "election", not through normal
     FidoNet channels, but through a listserv setup by some of the sysops
     in R10. A quick netmail to my NC to ask if he had heard anything of
     this came back with a "What the hell do you mean? I have never heard
     of an election being conducted this quick! " I sent him a copy of a
     message by Brenda Donovan, N202C and 10/3 RHUB in which she copied a
     message from Bob Satti. I was contacted back by my NC soon
     thereafter, and he said he had just gotten netmail on this from
     Brenda. He then asked how he was to gather a consensus of who to
     vote for in such a short time when the candidates are not even
     announced nor any discussion forum decided upon to hear the
     candidates platforms. I then reminded him that in the recently
     concluded ZEC election, that Kohl did not publish any platform
     until after the discussion period. My NC wrote back and told me he
     would not expect Kohl to publish his platform until the year 2000
     then. Another sysop stated we should vote for a candidate who at
     least sets term limits and does not mess with anyones' netmail.

     How anyone, especially someone who has the reputation of being fair
     as Satti does, can expect a regional election to be conducted with
     this kind of time frame is unbelievable. I can not even begin to
     think that Satti can expect a true representative outcome from an
     election conducted like this. Most of the NC's in R10 are not
     elected. To expect open discussions within each net, and to have the
     NC's vote according to the wishes of the nodes under them with this
     kind of time frame is unthinkable. Let's face it, there is not
     enough time allowed for the sysops to know what each candidate may
     stand for, let alone who they are. One can only conclude that Sharon
     locked Bob out of the house all winter and his brain has not yet
     fully defrosted or perhaps he is only suffering a bout of
     hypoglycemia from all that cheesecake.

     In Satti's message to those in R10, he mentions that "last week Bob
     Kohl and I came to an agreement to call for an election for RC in
     region 10." This quote almost makes it look as though the election
     was forced on Kohl. It could be that Kohl in turn had the task to
     devise the terms of the election, but I doubt it. There is no doubt,
     however, that both Bobs wish the election to be haste and swift,
     witness the following statement on the matter by Bob Kohl, "please
     respond in a timely fashion so that we can wrap this up and move on
     to other pending matters."

     One also has to wonder how Satti can allow Kohl to be a candidate,
     while Satti has an active Policy Complaint against Kohl on his desk,
     the outcome of which could conflict with Kohl's ability to function
     as R10C. A ruling on this PC is due two days after the conclusion of
     the election. It would have been prudent to postpone the ballot
     period until after the Policy Compliant has received at least
     Satti's ruling. This would have allowed a one week nomination/debate
     period, and then the ballot. Lest we not forget, there appears to be
     FIDONEWS 15-24               Page 8                   15 Jun 1998


     another Policy Complaint against Bob Kohl waiting in the wings on
     the same transgression.

     Another thing clearly missing in Satti's notice of election is any
     time frame regarding a term of office. What we in Region 10 are
     being asked to do is vote for an RC for life. While this is better
     than an appointed RC for life, it is not realistic. Bob Kohl has
     been the R10C for over 2 1/2 years. With no term defined, there is
     no indication that the person who wins will ever be replaced, after
     all at that time they will be the elected coordinator for the region.

     Satti has said he does not want those outside of Region 10 to be
     involved with this election since it does not concern them. I ask
     that those of you who would otherwise write Satti on this travesty
     to the election process to withhold doing so. He has stated it is an
     internal matter to R10. However, since Satti himself is involved, it
     is, therefore, an action that the RCC is involved with. If you feel
     you must send a message to someone on this Region 10 action, drop a
     message to your RC and urge them to bring the matter up with the RCC.

     Looking at this, one has to wonder who is driving the train, who is
     the conductor and where the hell is the brakeman who can put a stop
     to this madness?

     Dear Editorbeing,

     This article is submitted by Doc Logger (163/110) who was
     busy dodging speed traps on the south shore of the St.
     Lawrence River. Fortunately, the drogue chutes on the
     mid-life Crisis car opened long enough to haul him to a stop
     near a telephone booth. With only minor adjustments with C4
     plastique, an acetylene torch, and Lee-Anne Rimes music, he
     was able to extract a working pair of phone wires to connect
     to the modem.

     Roll da flic, Zorch.....


     Dear Reverend Visage,

     I have heard disturbing reports that you have traveled to
     the headwaters of the Orinoco where you have been engaged in
     a yage bender which has lasted for weeks. I am sure that I
     don't need to remind you that when you reach one of your
     tryptamine moments of delirium, you tend to scream about
     hordes of attacking ducks. I can only hope that your
     secretary is still an excellent shot with the curare dart
     gun.

     Speaking of paralyzed beasts, Visage, you'd be impressed
     that Bob "noted" Satti has remained in stasis...waiting
     patiently for a thought to wander through the lonely desert
     of his cerebrum. He has informed the Fidoserfs in Z1C that
     dealing with Kohl's excesses requires devoting all night,
     every night, trying to muster a coherent thought. Our
     prayers and our edible underwear (cheesecake flavoured)
     should go out to him in his hour of need.

     The messages from the tribal drums were garbled, but it
     appears that an election for RC has been called in Region10.
     The indications are that the nominating period will have
     closed 48 hours after the announcement which is pretty
     amusing since it takes at least that long for echomail to
     escape the event horizon of the screwed up mail distribution
     system in the region. There are already vague rumblings that
     the fix is in, and that this is another shotgun mandate of
     the type particularly favoured by Satti & his Merry
     Fartcatchers. What is amazing is that the other RCs (with a
     few notable exceptions) appear to have no shame or decency
     and have sat idly on their thumbs while Satti & Kohl proceed
     in the trashing of a whole region.

     If there is an election in Region10 which is sanctioned by
     Satti, then this bodes well for applying the same principle
     to have the ZC finally stand for election. Satti doesn't

     have a prayer of obtaining a sysop level mandate which
     probably explains his desire to keep scampering beneath the
     skirts of policy whenever he is reminded that his
     presumptive powers are all in the infertile reaches of his
     imagination.

     I see that His Zorchness is getting excitable about the Evil
     Empire aspirations of John Souvestre and has made his usual
     incorrect statements about the ELIST in his latest
     editorial. This discussion has reinvigorated the usual
     cretinous jackals who question whether His Zorchness should
     be the Snoozlord. One of the combatants went so far as to
     suggest that the previous editor appointed His Zorchness to
     the position which I'd bet half my stuffed armadillo
     collection that the claim has little basis in fact. Hell,
     the only one who has a prayer of being more fun as the
     Snoozlord would be Bob Moravsik who would have to learn to
     write in English before taking the job.

     I don't think I'll include a pithy quote for this week's
     Chautauqua but rather draw from several passing references
     to books that have mulched their way to the top of my
     reading pile. When I was a teenmonster I used to read
     science fiction that often referred to terraforming whole
     planets. This generally involved a presumed betterment of
     the habitation factor for the humanoid race, and often
     neglected to deal with the consequences to other lessor
     lifeforms. Rarer still was a philosophical discussion about
     whether the humanoids had the moral right to terraform
     anything.

     The first tidbit that caught my eye was that some of the
     hydro megaprojects have subtly altered the orbital period of
     the earth. In other words, the masses of water backed up
     behind some of the larger dams have been sufficient to
     change the centre of gravity of the whole planet. The second
     tidbit was the vast scale of underwater grading of the
     seabed caused by trawler ships. In some places, such as the
     Grand Banks area off the east coast of North America, what
     had once been an underwater topography of rolling hills,
     valleys and cliffs, have been flattened to uniformity. The
     scale is equivalent to bulldozering an area the size of
     Montana into a level plain. The third scrap of information
     that I've chosen for inclusion in my puzzle is the fact that
     some of the lushest rainforests also occupy land which is
     almost infertile by botanical standards. The Amazon basin,
     for example, which covers an enormous area, has a very thin
     soil covering. A typical slash & burn agricultural intrusion
     generally lasts only a few years before the soil is
     exhausted. The fragile soil chemistry means that recovery
     from clearing, or reforestation are unlikely or implausible.

     There is compelling evidence to suggest that the desiccation
     of the Sudan in Africa, and the expansion of the Kalahari to
     the southeast, are directly caused by the agricultural
     pressures of humanoids. If this process becomes the pattern
     FIDONEWS 15-24               Page 11                  15 Jun 1998


     in the Amazon the effects on global weather will be
     enormous. Similarly, the destruction of the Grand Banks
     ecology will have effects on global sea currents.

     I think I would have preferred to remain blissfully ignorant
     of the consequences of human alterations of the planet. My
     focus has been obtained from the strange weather we've been
     having in this part of the world. Our winter brought us an
     ice storm which ripped down trees and hydro lines. The
     broken tangles of trees in the local forests will almost
     surely make for forest fire conflagrations in the fall. We
     are also currently suffering from an extended drought. I
     find it intellectually unsatisfying to blame El Nino for
     these atmospheric events. With that in mind, and taking a
     whole chapter from His Zorchness' book, I'd like to call
     about John Souvestre right now to stop screwing around with
     the earth. If His Zorchness is to be believed, Souvestre's
     reach is so enormous that he *must* be responsible.


     I must go Visage, I'm scheduled to go fly fishing for Blue
     Whales off the coast of Newfoundland with Bridgit Bardot.
     She's a bit squeamish about baiting the hooks with chunks of
     tofu and needs my assistance.

     Doc Logger,

     International Fart Catchers' Association FAQ Sheet
     By Lesley-Dee Dylan
     1:250/525
     hippy@to.org

        From: Secretary, IFCA
          To: Propeller Head Junior
     Subject: FAQ sheet for the
              International Fart Catchers' Association

     Thank you so much for your recent application to the
     International Fart Catchers' Association.  Below is a FAQ sheet
     to provide you with our rules for membership.

     PHJ> How is one nominated for membership?

     Membership is usually achieved by nomination by an enemy, but
     self-nominations are accepted.

     PHJ> Is membership restricted to only international-quality fart
     PHJ> catchers?

     It is unusual to have someone nominated for membership in
     recogition of duties performed at a regional level rather than an
     international level, but it can happen.

     PHJ> Are there any membership dues?

     The membership fee of 24 tins of baked beans should be delivered,
     as soon as possible, to Vancouver.  This is usually done by the
     nominator, but if you are self-nominated, you will have to
     perform this duty yourself.  And if you are applying for a
     membership based on duties performed at a regional level, you
     will also be required to deliver a similar membership fee to your
     RC.

     PHJ> How often are the members required to renew their
     PHJ> membership?

     In most cases, annually, but in cases where there is outstanding
     performance of fart-catching duties, a life-membership is
     awarded.

     PHJ> Do you have to be a resident of the zone/region in which you
     PHJ> are doing your best fart-catching?

     We have accepted the nomination of Clay Tannacore for recognition
     of fart-catching in a region other than his own and are in the
     process of creating a new category of membership.  Alec Grynspan
     will be required to submit membership dues to Rockledge, Los
     Angeles and Vancouver.
     FIDONEWS 15-24               Page 14                  15 Jun 1998


     PHJ> I've seen magenta beanie caps and puce beanie caps.  Is there
     PHJ> a significance to the color differentiation?  Are there any
     PHJ> other colors available?

     The beanie caps are reversable, and can be worn magenta side to
     the brain or puce to the brain.  The propellers are always green
     and orange striped with purple pokadots.  But remember, you must
     unscrew the wing-bolt on the underside of the cap to remove the
     propeller, and then screw it on upside down when you turn the cap
     inside out.  Bob Kohl recently found this out the hard way, and
     caused some minor injuries. Fortunately, he had a small brain,
     and it wasn't too badly hurt by the scrambling it got.

     PHJ> How did you get to be recording secetary of such an esteemed
     PHJ> body as the Fart Catchers?

     Unfortunately, none of the member Fart Catchers are capable of
     handling the duties. None of them seem to be able to handle
     important details like transferring in-transit mail without
     forwarding it to the Chief Farter, or maintaining up-to-date
     nodelist segments, or membership lists.  One is even unable to
     appoint an REC.  So the Fart Catchers had to appoint an outsider
     as their recording secretary.

     The administration of the IFCA is perfectly aware that fart
     catching has a harmful effect on the intelligence of the catcher,
     since the brain capacity is reduced by the hot gasses caught, so
     if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask.  We
     have learned patience and understanding in the administrative
     capacities we choose to serve.
