     =================================================================


     I have heard that this past weekend's IFNA meeting came to an end
     with IFNA remaining alive.    As  I hear it, the reason has to do
     with  corporate laws which make  it  necessary  for  the  paid-up
     members of IFNA to vote in  favor of dissolution before the board
     can act.

     This  of  course  doesn't  necessarily have any  bearing  on  the
     operations  of  the  net.   IFNA has been  a  largely  irrelevant
     presence for the past two years or so, and the fact that today it
     continues  to  exist changes nothing.  In fact, if you  carefully
     read  this week's nodelist, or for that matter the first page  of
     FidoNews, you will see that life is indeed going on without IFNA.

     Since IFNA  continues to exist, and since its bylaws require that
     it regard FidoNews  as  its  official  publication, there will no
     doubt be many articles  here,  probably until some time after the
     formal ending of the Association.    Most, I suspect, will relate
     to official business that simply must be transacted.

     Be patient with them.  And  please  don't  get  the  idea  that I
     consider it appropriate to start dancing on  IFNA's  grave.  IFNA
     was a damned fine idea which died of a particularly toxic mixture
     of cynicism and apathy.  When the time finally comes, I'll  mourn
     the passing of  this  idea, if you don't mind.  Please just allow
     me my moment of silence. Thank you.

     Come to FidoCon '90!

     by Bill VanGlahn, 1/90, FidoCon Committee Chairman

     As you may or may not know, this year's FidoCon is being hosted
     August 1-5 at the Conclave '90 sysops convention by the Secret
     Sysop Society in Net 107 in New Jersey.  As you can probably
     guess by the name, we're out to have some fun!  Well, now that
     we've gotten our act together, here's some of the details, but
     remember, don't tell anyone!  It's a SECRET!  ;-)

     We wanted this year's FidoCon to be more than just a convention.
     Past FidoCon's have been lots of fun for the sysops, but
     probably pretty boring for the rest of the family, so we've gone
     out of our way to make sure that this year you can plan on
     spending a real vacation here in the New York/New Jersey
     metropolitan area.

     Additionally, we've also simplified the registration procedures
     with our all-inclusive "chinese menu" registration form (to be
     published next week or the following).  No longer will you have
     to worry about what meals you're going to attend, make your own
     room reservations, etc.  Just pick the plan you want to have,
     and we'll take care of the rest!

     Well, on with the show:

     Plans A & B include the hotel room, all meals (including
     Friday's banquet), and the conference fee, all in one cost.

     Please note the discounts for early registration:

                                       Before 6/1/90:  Before 4/1/90:
                                       --------------  --------------
     A. Single Occupancy.......$595.00     $545.00        $495.00
     B. Double Occupancy.......$450.00     $400.00        $350.00
     C. Conference w/ meals....$300.00     $250.00        $200.00
     D. Conference w/ Banquet..$205.00     $155.00        $105.00
     E. Conference only........$175.00     $125.00         $75.00
     F. Banquet only...........$130.00      $80.00         $30.00

     (Those registering before 4/1/90 get a $100.00 discount, those
     registering before 6/1/90 get a $50.00 discount on all plans.)

     The conference opens with a pool-side welcoming cocktail party,
     at which beer & wine will be covered by your meal ticket.
     Friday night will be the sysop's banquet, which is also included
     in plans A-D (and F, of course), and there'll be a special
     barbecue lunch on saturday afternoon.

     Seminars will be held from 10am till noon, and from 1PM until 4,
     to give all participants plenty of time to recover from those
     all-night 'bull sessions' where the REAL activity takes place!

     We promised you outdoor activies, too, so here they are:

     (Since we're dealing with sysops, we've formatted the 'external
     events' into an event table)

     Sat     19:30   22:00   ;Grand Costume Ball         $50.00*

     * Costume mandatory, and included in entrance fee

     The TWILIGHT TOUR of New York includes a ride through Times
     Square (you know, that place you see every New Year's Eve), the
     marquees of Broadway, a trip to Macy's, the world's largest
     department store, a walking tour through Greenwich Village, then
     a ride through Soho and Little Italy and then to Chinatown for
     dinner.  The tour then continues on to the financial district of
     Wall Street, and Battery Park, where you'll board a ferry that
     will take you across New York harbor to Ellis Island and a
     breath-taking view of the Manhattan skyline.  The tour then
     finishes off with a trip past the United Nations building,
     Rockefeller Center, the Channell Gardens, and terminates at the
     Empire State building.  All in all, the tour takes about 5 hours
     and is well worth the fee of $37.50.

     The Grand Costume Ball will be held at Medieval Times, a new
     type of dinner theater, where the times of King Arthur are
     brought to life again.  The theater is an actual medieval area,
     where feats of heroics, jousting tournaments, and demonstrations
     of Renaissance life are recreated, all while you enjoy a true
     Medieval feast!  Costumes are mandatory, and included in the
     $50.00 fee.

     The day trips to the beach are held at the famous New Jersey
     Shore, at beautiful SEAside Park.  Lay on the beach all day, or
     enjoy the amusement park on the boardwalk!  Anyone for miniature
     golf?  $24.50 includes bus fare.

     Trips to Atlantic City include bus fare to the famous casinos on
     the board walk, as well as casino 'comps' (coupons, rebates,
     free tickets, etc.).  The activities on the beach and boardwalk
     are also available for those not into the fast action and bright
     lights of the casinos.  $22.00

     For those so inclined, registration also includes use of the on
     premises Meadowlands Health Club and all equipment, and free
     admission to Cricket's nightclub and disco.

     For further information, please contact me at 1:1/90.

     Of course, we'll have the usual airline discounts (details
     soon), so we hope to see you all there!

     Internetwork Gateway Policy
     ------------ ------- ------

     Tim Pearson
     1:286/703


     I submitted this article not in an attempt to  elicit  additional
     caustic  reactions  to  the  "Gateway  Document" but rather in an
     attempt to clarify  and  correct  a  few  misconceptions  and  to
     publicly  answer  some questions I've been asked frequently since
     the document was published.

     I'd like to begin  with  some  answers  to  some  commonly  asked
     questions:

     -  "Is  the  Gateway Document in effect now?  The article said it
     would go into effect in 30 days."

     No,  the document is not in effect.  No,  that is  not  what  the
     article  said  would happen.  The article said the document would
     be submitted to the International  Coordinator  for  approval  in
     thirty days. Everyone will be given ample notice before the
     document goes into effect.  Stay tuned to FidoNews.


     -  "I'm the IC of XYZ-Net.  Am I going to loose my echomail feeds
     when the document is implemented?"

     No evil FidoNet axe will fall upon your echomail feed at midnight
     on the day  the  document  goes  into  effect.  The  Internetwork
     Coordinator  will  help you find the software necessary to comply
     with the requirements.  No reasonable request for  assistance  or
     additional  time  has  or  will  be  refused.  Please contact the
     Internetwork  Coordinator  for   further   information   on   the
     registration  and  certification  process.   Over  a  half  dozen
     networks have already registered.  None of them were turned down.


     - "If my nodes have FidoNet addresses then I can't get a gateway,
     right?  The  document says that if you have a FidoNet address you
     must get your echomail directly from FidoNet."

     Wrong.  The document says that this is the  expected  method.  It
     assumes  that  most  folks  with  other  than  a purely political
     motivation would prefer to take the shortest distance between two
     points.   The  overriding  consideration  is   that   non-FidoNet
     addresses  not  appear in FidoNet echomail while said echomail is
     inside  FidoNet  and  that  all   echomail   gateways   also   be
     bidirectional  netmail gateways.  If you have a case to make with
     respect to this issue,  please make it  (even  if  it  is  purely
     political).  The  key  issue in my mind is that you demonstrate a
     willingness to cooperate with FidoNet in good faith on  technical
     and  administrative  issues.  We certainly pledge to cooperate in
     good faith  with  you.  Don't  believe  everything  you  hear.  I
     suggest you contact the Internetwork Coordinator directly and see
     FidoNews 7-05                Page 6                   29 Jan 1990


     for yourself if all the dire predictions are true.



     - "Where do you get the authority to implement such a document?"

     I direct your attention to Section 7.1 of Policy4 as adopted by
     FidoNet.


     I was going to address some other points next.  However,  I think
     the following echomail reply to what,  in my opinion,  was a very
     sincere  message  from  Jack  Decker  makes  these  points   more
     concisely  than any rewording I could come up with.  I would like
     to thank Mr. Decker for his reasoned approach to this issue.

     Yes I do feel that there is a sincere need for the document. I'll
     try to explain why as we go along here...

     > I hope you saw my article in Fidonews in which I expressed
     > some reservations about this document.

     I do remember reading one you wrote, Jack.  To be totally honest,
     as I sit here now,  I can't remember what points you made  versus
     points  made  by  others who wrote similar articles.  As you say,
     there have been  several.  I'm  sorry  I  can't  recall  it  more
     clearly.

     I'm afraid I can't subscribe to your conclusion,  Jack,  although
     from looking only at the public record I can  certainly  see  how
     you  arrived  at it.  I would think the same thing had I only had
     FidoNews articles to rely on.  The fact is that I (and others  on
     the  GPDC)  have  received numerous positive comments via netmail
     from folks inside as well  as  folks  outside  FidoNet.  We  have
     received  applications  from  over  a half dozen "Other Networks"
     (none of which have been rejected,  by the way) who seem  willing
     to  accept even the original draft of the document.  Human nature
     makes things work kind of like  the  evening  news.  One  usually
     doesn't  hear  loud  and  long  public  outcry from those who are
     FidoNews 7-05                Page 7                   29 Jan 1990


     satisfied with the way things are going.  They have no  incentive
     to "go public." Similarly,  you don't see evening news broadcasts
     filled with reports on how things are going right  in  the  world
     very often. To be quite honest, I feel that (as we so clearly saw
     in  the  IFNA  referendum) the "I don't give a damn's" are in the
     majority again in this case.

     I've already spoken to the "general consensus" issue above  so  I
     won't waste your time with a restatement of that position. I will
     try  to  address  the  "who asked for it?" part of your question.
     This was an ongoing process when I became an  RC  almost  exactly
     one year ago.  David Dodell was IC then as I'm sure you remember.
     David,  Randy Bush and virtually all of the RC's at the time (and
     now as far as I know) seemed to feel that we had a  problem  that
     would  only  get  worse.  We  couldn't  possibly make these other
     networks go away even if we wanted to (and we  didn't  want  to).
     Therefore,  we  felt  and feel that we should try to put a set of
     guidelines in place to try to bring some  order  to  the  chaotic
     "grab  a  zone" practice that was ongoing at the time.  David was
     getting netmails every week asking him as IC to "assign"  so  and
     so  zone  such  and  such.  He was getting messages whose content
     consisted of irate complaints about network "A" having  zone  123
     before  network  "B"  and how he should make network "B" use some
     other zone number.  It was a mess.  I think  I  do  remember  you
     saying  that  we  are all agreed that Zonegates don't make proper
     network gateways.  Well, then and now, many folks feel they do. I
     don't think it is malicious.  I just think they  don't  know  any
     better.

     I tried to bring forward another problem in the lead-in article I
     wrote  when the draft document was published.  That problem being
     that these illicit zone numbers  were  breaking  FidoNet/Internet
     gateways. (Someone took issue with the use of the word "illicit".
     From  FidoNet's  point  of  view,  that is what these non-FidoNet
     addresses are.)

     Someone somewhere made the suggestion  that  this  could  all  be
     fixed  if  only  FidoNet  would compile all the FTN Other Network
     nodelists along with its own.  We have enough trouble keeping our
     own  nodelist current.  The technical and logistic nightmare this
     would create should  be  obvious.  Not  to  mention  the  "minor"
     problem  that  several  FTN  other  nets  are using the same zone
     number.

     FidoNews 7-05                Page 8                   29 Jan 1990


     The only workable solution we could come up with  was  simply  to
     require that only FidoNet addresses appear in FidoNet mail.  That
     means  that  some  other networks are going to have to change the
     way their gateways  work.  We  are  in  the  process  of  helping
     several  other  networks  to  obtain  and  implement the software
     necessary to run a proper gateway right now.

     I'm not going to get into a counterproductive discussion  of  why
     these  "walls"  exist and who raised them.  The fact is that they
     exist because other networks exist.  These  other  networks  have
     their  own  way of doing things,  their own nodelists,  their own
     addressing schemes,  and their own reasons for existance.  All of
     that  is  fine.  We  are  attempting  to  cut  some  standardized
     bidirectional "doors" in these walls.

     We are not trying to make communication more difficult.  The fact
     is,  Jack,   that  communication  is  virtually  impossible  (via
     netmail)  to  many  of  the current other networks that are using
     FidoNet echos.  How can we  possibly  enforce  moderator's  rules
     about  topical  limitations  when the option to "take it netmail"
     doesn't exist in many cases?  I would like to  see  one  standard
     method  agreed upon for internetwork routing.  I don't care if it
     is the RBBS-Net method or the ^ADOMAIN method or  something  else
     entirely as long as it works -- both directions.

     One  last point and then I'll let you rest your eyes.  I've heard
     many people say how biased and unfair the document  is.  Consider
     the  analogy  to  a  trade agreement between the U.S.  and,  say,
     Japan.  The folks in  the  U.S.  think  the  Japanese  are  being
     unfair.  The  Japanese  think  the  folks  in the U.S.  are being
     unfair.  It is all a matter  of  perspective.  Folks  in  FidoNet
     look  at  it  from  the  FidoNet  perspective.  Others look at it
     differently.  My job as a FidoNetter is to look out for the  best
     interest  of  my  network.  I'm  trying to do that.  If I did any
     less,  I would be derelict in my obligation to my network.  Folks
     have  every  right  to  establish  as many other networks as they
     like.  If we're honest,  Jack,  we'll admit that without  FidoNet
     echomail,  most of them would wither on the vine.  Is it too much
     to ask that they partake of  their  lifeblood  in  a  manner  not
     harmful to their host?  I hope you would agree that the answer to
     that question is no.

     Take care (sorry for my verbosity),

     _NO_NEED_  for  FidoNet to compile an OtherNet's nodelist. The ZC
     of AnyOtherNet could compile his own nodelist using the  keywords
     SINDEX and either FIDOTXT or FIDOPRN in his XLATLIST.CTL file (or
     equivalent  if  using  a  different  nodelist compiler). Take the
     sorted index at the end of  his  NODELIST.TXT/NODELIST.PRN  file.
     Example   for   AlterNet   -   Dos-command   `COPY   NODELIST.PRN
     ANETLIST.PRN'. AnyOtherNet ZC then fires up a text editor. `EDLIN
     ANETLIST.PRN'. Delete the tedious node-by-node list at the top, &
     keep the net by net sorted index.  Now  netmail  file-attach  the
     `sorted-index-only'  to a volunteer at a `central-clearing-house'
     serving _ALL_ networks (FidoNet included).

     At  the  `central-clearing-house',  the  volunteer  compares  the
     `SINDEX-only'   NODELIST.PRN   from  FidoNet,  ANETLIST.PRN  from
     AlterNet, NETLIST.PRN from NETWORK/FamilyNet,  RBBSLIST.PRN  from
     RBBS-Net, EGGLIST.PRN from EggNet, etc.

     Said   volunteer   looks   for  `net'  number  (of  <Net>/<Node>)
     collisions where 2 or more political networks use the same  `net'
     number.  _IMPERATIVE_  that  only  one network use a `net' number
     within any FidoNet Geo-Zone - (Easier on mailer software if `net'
     numbers were only used once world-wide, but not essential.)

      TP> The only workable solution we could come up with
      TP> was simply to require that only FidoNet addresses

     See Above.

     Primary  reason  for  leaving  `foreign  net'  (ie   non-FidoNet)
     addresses  in  echomail  "seen-by"  lines  is "dupe" control. ANY
     `circular   feed'   causes   dupes.   If   a    seen-by-stripping
     internet-echogate  is  included in an accidental `circular feed',
     the dupes are spread much farther than a  `circular  feed'  which
     does not include an echogate in the path.

     Adding to original SYSOP echo message:

     In  addition  to  the 2-step method of first FReq'ing the desired
     AnyOtherNet nodelist then sending direct netmail, _REAL_  working
     zonegates could be set up between the various networks.

     Back in the days when NETWORK and RBBS-Net were formed,  everyone
     _THOUGHT_  "Zones"  _HAD_  to  be  single-digit numbers causing a
     false appearance of a shortage of usable zones. Actually only the
     TABBY package (versions 2.1 and  earlier)  has  the  single-digit
     zone  problem.   QuickBBS  will  handle  zone  numbers 1-255, and
     BinkleyTerm will handle zones 1-4095 (.001 - .FFF  extensions  on
     the separate holding-area for each zone setup).

     RBBS-Net  could  switch  to  a  multi-digit  zone  number thereby
     eliminating the  "2  zone  8s"  conflict.  Same  basic  principle
     applies to any/all other "shared zone" conflicts.

                A MODERATED ECHOMAIL CONFERENCE PROCESSOR

     [continued from last week]

     AN OPTIONAL ADD-ON TO THE BASIC PROPOSAL

     Last week I presented the basic proposal for a moderated
     echomail conference processor.  I'd also like to throw out a
     proposal for an option that would partially emulate one other
     advantage of GroupMail, namely, that every system that receives
     a conference gets the same message bundle.  Please note that
     the following discussion applies to message packets that are
     being sent downbound from the conference moderator's system,
     NOT to messages that are upbound to the moderator, and that the
     following is really a separate proposal from the above.  The
     following discussion will be meaningless if moderated
     conference mail is not implemented, but what follows should be
     considered an optional add-on to the basic moderated conference
     mail proposal described above.  This add-on will greatly
     facilitate the handling of pass-thru conferences when
     implemented as part of any moderated conference mail processor.

     First, an explanation of the GroupMail feature we're trying to
     improve upon:  Under GroupMail, when a system receives a
     message bundle for a particular conference, it does NOT unpack
     and re-toss the bundle before passing it along to any downlinks
     that receive the conference from that system.  Instead, the
     bundle is passed along unchanged, just as received.  So, if the
     unpacking software "grunges" a message (as often happens when a
     disk full or similar unexpected condition occurs), it only
     affects the display of the message on that particular system,
     and does not affect the condition of the message bundle
     received at any downstream system.

     GroupMail does this by building a separate message bundle (and,
     ultimately, a separate .ARC file) for each and every available
     conference.  The advantage of doing this can be explained if
     you consider the case where (for example) you feed a large echo
     to several different systems.  With echomail you have to toss
     the messages separately for each system.  Thus, if you receive
     a 200K packet of FOR-SALE and feed it to five systems, you'll
     need one meg of free space (5 systems * 200K) just to toss
     those messages to the five individual systems, plus some
     additional room to allow the archiver to try and compress those
     packets.  With GroupMail, you'd receive the one 200K packet (in
     ARCed format) and store it in a holding area, and that one
     packet would be sent to all five systems.

     FidoNews 7-05                Page 14                  29 Jan 1990


     The disadvantage of this scheme is that if all conferences are
     stored in individual archives, then a system receiving seventy
     different GroupMail conferences could conceivably receive
     seventy different archives (one for each conference) every
     night.  As fast as most mailers are, there is still a certain
     amount of turnaround time required each time a different file
     is sent, so transmitting a number of small archives instead of
     one large one increases the connection time required to receive
     one's nightly echo feeds. Also, each conference archive must be
     individually named in such a manner as to prevent name
     collisions, while not using a filename that may have some
     meaning to a mailer program (e.g. a filename that might appear
     to be an attach file or a request file or a mail packet).

     There's also the question of how long to retain each individual
     message archive.  As mentioned above, with echomail you will
     temporarily create one copy of the messages in any given
     conference for EACH system receiving the conference (so, if you
     are feeding an echo to five different systems, you will
     temporarily have five different copies of the messages in that
     echo on your system).  BUT, as these message packets are sent
     to the recipient systems, they are automatically deleted from
     your system.  With GroupMail, you only keep one copy of any
     given set of echo messages, but you have to keep it around
     until all the systems you've fed the echo to have had a chance
     to retrieve it from you system.  Given that systems sometimes
     have technical problems that may keep them from connecting on a
     given night, and sysops sometime go away for weekends (at which
     point Murphy invariably takes over and crashes their systems),
     the normal retention time for GroupMail echoes has to be set at
     3 to 5 days in order to make sure that no messages are "missed"
     by any downstream system.  So the advantage of only having to
     store one copy of the messages in a given conference for all
     the nodes you feed it to is largely negated by the requirement
     to keep 3-5 days's worth of messages around in order to make
     sure that none of the systems you feed miss any messages.

     Finally, when the same message archive is sent to all systems
     you feed, it must be stored in an archive format that can be
     uncompressed at all systems being fed.  Unfortunately, none of
     the best archivers are portable across all computing
     environments found in Fidonet.  So the "least common
     denominator" approach is used (.ARC format archives in the case
     of GroupMail) which insures that virtually all systems
     receiving GroupMail packets can unARC them without difficulty,
     but at a cost of longer transmission times and greater disk
     space storage requirements than would be necessary if a newer
     archiver could be used.

     For these and other reasons, I do not feel that storing each
     day's worth of messages from a conference in an individual
     ARCHIVE file is a good idea.  However, storing each conference
     in a separate BUNDLE (that is, a separate .PKT file) which is
     then packed to each recipient might be an effective way to
     transmit moderated conference mail.

     FidoNews 7-05                Page 15                  29 Jan 1990


     Let's consider how an advanced conference mail processor might
     handle moderated conferences:

     1) An incoming mail ARCHIVE (a .mo?, .tu?, ... .su?) file
     arrives from another system.

     2) The conference mail processor finds this packet, determines
     which archive format was used to create it (ARC, ZIP, LHARC,
     ZOO, etc.) and calls the proper de-archiver to decompress the
     file and recover the individual .PKT files.

     3) The header of the .PKT files are examined and if they are a
     standard .PKT file (as currently used) they are processed in
     the normal manner (messages are tossed/scanned to/from the
     appropriate netmail or echomail areas).  However, if the header
     indicates that the incoming .PKT file is a moderated echo
     conference, it is temporarily moved to a separate directory
     (actually, placing these files in a separate directory may not
     be necessary, but it's easier to mentally visualize the process
     if we separate these files).  Please note that each of these
     new type .PKT files will contain messages from only one
     moderated conference per .PKT file (for example, if we received
     feeds of FOR-SALE, TECH, and COMM, we'd get three moderated
     conference style .PKT files, one for each of the three
     conferences).  Also please note that both types of .PKT files
     may be intermixed in the same mail archive (this solves the
     problem of having to transmit multiple files).

     4) As the new style .PKT files are moved to the holding area, a
     temporary index is constructed showing which conference area
     tag relates to each of the .PKT files (for example, showing
     that packet 12345678.PKT contains messages for the FOR-SALE
     echo).  Each area tag in the index is then examined and the
     associated .PKT file may be handled in any of the following
     ways:

     If the .PKT file is NOT associated with a passthru area, then
     the messages in that .PKT file are tossed to the appropriate
     message areas on your system.

     If the .PKT file is associated with an area that is fed to
     other (downstream) systems, then the .PKT file is archived into
     an outgoing mail ARCHIVE (a .mo?, .tu?, ... .su?) file destined
     for each of those systems, WITHOUT change.  The .PKT file that
     is received is the .PKT file that goes out.  Note that in this
     case the PATH line in the messages cannot be changed.  However,
     the integrity of the .PKT file is maintained (assuming that no
     errors were encountered in the process of unarchiving the .PKT
     file in the first place... obviously, such errors should be
     trapped).

     FidoNews 7-05                Page 16                  29 Jan 1990


     It should be noted here that if a moderated conference is
     converted to regular echomail, then it MUST be unpacked and a
     SEEN-BY line must be added to each message, and the system's
     net/node number must be added to the PATH line of each message.
     The messages in that conference may then be re-packed as
     echomail to the conference in question.  To do otherwise would
     defeat the duplicate message security built into this scheme
     (this would in most cases make the use of the -p and -e
     switches together on the same AREAS.BBS line invalid, however,
     I suppose a truly ambitious programmer could figure out a way
     to adjust the PATH lines in the .PKT files of passthru
     conferences without first unpacking and tossing the individual
     messages).

     5) Once the individual .PKT files have been tossed to your
     system and/or archived to other downstream systems that receive
     them from you, they are deleted immediately (generally in the
     same scan/toss cycle), and don't hang around taking up space on
     your system (some software might allow you to optionally
     override this if for some reason you wanted to keep the .PKT
     files around for a day or two).

     One might reasonably ask how a conference mail processor is
     supposed to know that a .PKT file contains a moderated echo
     conference, and how to determine the area tag.  Please consider
     the header of a typical .PKT file:

          PktHType = Record
           OrigNode      : integer;
           DestNode      : integer;
           Year          : integer;
           Month         : integer;
           Day           : integer;
           Hour          : integer;
           Minute        : integer;
           Second        : integer;
           DestBaud      : integer;
           PktVers       : integer;
           OrigNet       : integer;
           Destnet       : integer;
           Product       : char;
           filler        : char;
           PwdKludge     : Array[1..8] of char;
           filler        : Array[1..24] of char;
          end;

     Since the baud rate of the destination system is a totally
     useless piece of information in an echomail header packet (and
     since virtually all systems get this information from someplace
     other than the packet header anyway), I propose that we utilize
     one byte of this integer as a "signature byte" which will
     indicate to a conference mail processor that this is a
     moderated echomail packet.  No true modem baud rate currently
     in use is an odd value (I think we can safely ignore the
     oddities such as 1200/75 splits used by commercial videotex
     services in some countries), therefore, bit 0 of the least
     FidoNews 7-05                Page 17                  29 Jan 1990


     significant bit of the least significant byte will never be set
     if this field really contains a modem value.  I therefore
     propose the field be redefined as follows for moderated
     conference mail:

     Instead of:         DestBaud      : integer;

     We'd use:           EchoPktFlag   : Char;
                         SerialNo      : Char;

     Where the echo packet type would be defined as follows:

          Bit  0        1 if moderated conference mail, 0 otherwise
          Bits 7-6      Reserved for future use

     Again, the implication is that if bit 0 is not set, the packet
     is a normal mail packet containing regular netmail or regular
     echomail (or both).  If bit 1 IS set, the packet contains ONLY
     moderated conference mail which meets the following criteria:

     1)  The packet is exactly as it was when it left the
     moderator's system (the .PKT file is totally unmodified except
     for being unpacked and repacked) and,

     2)  The packet contains moderated echomail that is downbound
     from the moderator ONLY and,

     3)  ALL messages in the area are for the SAME conference and
     have the exact same AREA tag (the conference mail processor
     will normally only read the first AREA tag of the first
     message).

     If the moderated conference .PKT file is changed in ANY way,
     then the system making the change must reset bit 0 of the
     EchoPktFlag (in effect changing the packet to a normal echomail
     PACKET, although the messages contained therein would still be
     flagged as part of a moderated conference) AND the system must
     add its address to the PATH line of each message in the packet.

     You will note that I have suggested a redefinition of the
     second byte of the Destination Baud integer as a Serial Number
     byte.  This would simply be a byte value that is incremented at
     the moderators' system each time a new message packet is issued
     (with rollover from 255 to 0).  In this manner the recipient of
     a conference area could, if he so desired, keep track of this
     value and thereby be alerted to any interruptions or missing
     packets in the echo feed.

     Actually, if I could be sure that the 24 bytes of filler in the
     .PKT file header were not being used by anyone, I would suggest
     that this information could go in there, rather than usurping
     the DestBaud integer.  Were that to happen, I'd prefer to see a
     two-byte value for the serial number, and also a 32-bit CRC
     value calculated on the portion of the .PKT file following the
     header (e.g., starting with the first byte of the first message
     header) to insure the integrity of the .PKT file.

     It should be obvious, as you read the above, that a new style
     moderated conference .PKT file would be completely compatible
     with virtually all currently existing mail processors.  These
     processors would simply treat such packets as they would any
     other bundle of incoming echomail.  In fact, the ONLY reason
     that such packets would need to be unpacked before sending to a
     system that is only capable of handling regular echomail is so
     that the required SEEN-BY line can be added, and the PATH line
     updated, in order to protect against duplicate message
     generation.

     It should be noted that when the -m switch is used in the
     AREAS.BBS file, a conference mail processor that supports this
     optional add-on to the basic moderated conference mail scheme
     should toss mail to the appropriate conference area as it is
     received, but NOT scan (export) it unless a specific switch is
     used on the command line when the mail processor is invoked.
     Normally you'd have a once-daily event that would invoke the
     processor with that switch, in order to scan and export
     messages from any areas that you moderate, followed IMMEDIATELY
     by a call to whatever you use to renumber and clean up that
     message area.  It would not normally be a good idea to
     automatically delete messages from the conferences you moderate
     at any time other than immediately after the daily message
     export from that area (this would prevent messages arriving
     after the export event but before the cleanup event from being
     deleted before they can go out).  And, of course, the moderated
     conference mail processor would have to build the .PKT files
     for each conference according to the specifications mentioned
     above.

     One potential problem exists at this point, and that is the
     possibility of creating duplicate .PKT file names.  Consider
     that many conference moderators might decide to run their
     once-daily export events at about the same time (just after
     midnight, for example) and therefore a .PKT file naming scheme
     based solely on time just might produce packets for different
     conference areas with the same filenames.  It would therefore
     seem wise to at least try and avoid the potential for duplicate
     filenames by using a .PKT file naming scheme that is not based
     solely on the time of day.

     The root portion of a .PKT filename may contain any valid
     hexadecimal character (0-9 or A-F).  Therefore, one possible
     scheme might be to use a four character checksum of the
     conference name plus some time dependent information.  For
     example, the following scheme might create adequately unique
     filenames:

          Mail packet filename format: cccctttt.PKT

     FidoNews 7-05                Page 19                  29 Jan 1990


     .....where cccc is a 32 bit checksum of the conference area
     tag, and tttt is the number of seconds past the start of the
     month (at the time the .PKT file is created) expressed in
     hexadecimal format.

     No .PKT file naming scheme can GUARANTEE unique filenames for
     conferences created on different systems, so it would be best
     if the moderated conference mail packer could check existing
     mail archives for duplicate filenames before adding a new .PKT
     file (I realize this may be difficult to do, however, given the
     number of different archiving programs in common use today).
     If such a check were made, renaming of .PKT files to avoid name
     collisions WOULD be permissible.  Yet another possibility would
     be to use a base 36 character set (0-9 or A-Z), or perhaps
     better yet, a base 20 character set (the letters G-Z ONLY, to
     positively avoid conflicts with .PKT filenames created by
     existing mail packers) for the root part of moderated
     conference mail .PKT filenames, and base these on some sort of
     random numbering scheme.  To some extent, the preferred method
     of avoiding .PKT file name collisions should be left to the
     software authors, but the (admittedly small) potential for
     difficulty should not be ignored.

     POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS

     The above about covers the technical end of this proposal.
     Alas, there are the political considerations to contend with.
     I propose the following as sort of a Policy Statement in regard
     to moderated echomail:

     1) Anyone who converts moderated echomail to regular echomail
     may do so without prior permission to feed leaf nodes (nodes
     that do not further distribute the conference further) ONLY.
     If a node receiving a converted echomail feed wishes to pass
     that feed along to other nodes, the conference moderator's
     permission is required.  In any event, the node that converts
     moderated echomail to regular echomail is responsible for
     knowing which systems are receiving the conference via his
     system (either directly or indirectly) and for making sure that
     "dupe loops" are not created.

     2) It should be considered a serious violation of policy to
     feed moderated echomail conferences to a node capable of
     processing only regular echomail without inserting the required
     SEEN-BY and PATH lines (put another way, within an AREAS.BBS
     file the -d switch must NOT be used to feed a node that is not
     running a "moderated conference mail aware" echomail processor.
     The -e switch MUST be used instead).

     3) As long as moderated echomail is distributed as moderated
     echomail, (not converted to regular echomail), the propagation
     of duplicate messages is nearly impossible.  Therefore, there
     is no reason that the distribution of moderated echomail
     conferences needs to be restricted by anything other than
     least-cost routing considerations (that is, geographic
     restrictions are not really appropriate for conferences in
     FidoNews 7-05                Page 20                  29 Jan 1990


     which duplicate messages cannot easily be propagated).

     4) IF the new packet type as described above (with the header
     bit indicating that the packet is moderated echomail) is used,
     then it shall NOT be a requirement that the uplink and downlink
     paths between any particular system and the moderator's system
     be the same; however, if a conference is made available on a
     BBS, then an uplink path for replies MUST be provided.  The
     intent of this provision is to allow specific conferences, or
     groups of conferences, to be distributed via one-way channels
     (e.g. radio or satellite feeds) to reduce the costs for those
     wishing to receive the conference.  However, if an uplink path
     back to the moderator's system were not provided, users of a
     BBS might wrongly assume that they could leave messages that
     would be seen by all participants of the conference.  Thus, the
     requirement that an uplink path for replies must be made
     available.  The moderator of a conference may waive this
     requirement (although doing so is not recommended except in the
     case of "read-only" conferences).

     5) Complaints that moderated echomail equals censorship are
     really not valid.  Consider that Fidonet echomail is one of the
     few mediums in which folks seem to think they should be able to
     say anything they doggone well please.  Most sysops would not
     allow users to post just anything that they might want to say
     in any conference they feel like saying it in, yet some of
     these same sysops will be the first to complain about anyone
     who tries to implement some effective moderation in echomail.

     This proposal addresses that concern by insuring that echomail
     processors will be able to handle BOTH types of echomail (both
     moderated and unmoderated) as easily as regular echomail is now
     run.  So it would not be an either/or choice for sysops and
     echomail hub operators whether to run moderated or unmoderated
     echomail.  Right now we have echomail hubs that offer only
     echomail conferences and GroupMail hubs that offer only
     GroupMail conferences, but with software designed to be
     compliant with this proposal, all hubs would be able to handle
     both types of conferences.  Thus, it would be strictly up to
     the moderator of a conference as to whether that conference
     should be moderated or unmoderated.  In the case of conferences
     that have been on the backbone for a long time, many would
     undoubtedly remain as regular (unmoderated) echomail
     conferences.  But for new conferences, shouldn't it be the
     moderator's option as to how closely he wishes to moderate a
     conference?  After all, no one will force anybody to join a
     conference that they feel is too tightly moderated.

     CLOSING COMMENTS

     I think that about covers everything.  If you feel this
     proposal is missing something, please drop me a note at 154/8
     or if that won't work for you, you can send it to 1:154/9.  You
     can also leave comments in the NET_DEV echo but keep in mind
     that echomail currently isn't always as reliable as netmail,
     and occasionally my feed of NET_DEV does seem to be interrupted
     FidoNews 7-05                Page 21                  29 Jan 1990


     for various reasons (technical, not political!).  One question
     that I have left open (mostly because I don't really want this
     proposal to get mired in political concerns) is whether some
     mechanism should be included for routing private netmail
     replies to echomail back up to the sender of the original
     message via the same path that the original message came down?
     I wouldn't mind seeing such a mechanism included, but it would
     require some changes to the above proposal and worse, it might
     make the whole proposal politically unacceptable in Fidonet
     (besides that, I think there are better ways to devise a
     netmail routing scheme for Fidonet, should we ever have the
     collective will to do so.  See my article in Fidonews 7-01 if
     you'd like my thoughts on a netmail routing scheme).

     I will probably send this proposal up to the Fidonet Technical
     Standards Committee in a week or two, but I reserve the right
     to make revisions first, based on any comments I may receive
     from readers of these articles.  Your constructive comments are
     welcome.

     A Reply to Mr. Riddle
     Phil Root
     NC 285
     285/0, 285/17


             Having  been forwarded a copy of Mr.  Riddle's article on
     the Proposed Gateway Policy Document, I'd like to mention a short
     rebuttal.   I  feel that  some of the 'facts' that he puts  forth
     could use some clarification,  and perhaps,  I can point out some
     errors in his logic.

     Point 1:   Mr. Riddle says that the major issue facing Fidonet is
     that of direction.   I feel that he is wrong.  He states the real
     issues  are  how  the  current  coordinators  acceded  to   their
     positions,  how  they remain there,  the management and  personal
     attitudes  they represent....   I think that this indicates  that
     the proposed Gateway Policy Document has absolutely nothing to do
     with his dissatisfaction.  It wouldn't matter at all if it was an
     absolutely  PERFECT  document,  (which  it isn't,  but  that's  a
     different matter),  the point that he makes is that since it  was
     proposed  by  the *c structure,  and individual sysops  were  not
     "consulted",  etc.  that it is somehow flawed.  I find this logic
     to be somewhat contorted.

     Point 2:   Mr. Riddle is mistaken in his assumption that POLICY 4
     mandated  membership  in the local net.   It doesn't.   It  does,
     however,  grant to the International,  Zone, Regional and Network
     coordinators the ability to manage the nodelist for the  greatest
     effeciency.   In  this  case,  the Regional coordinator saw  that
     there was an existing net in the Omaha calling area.  There  were
     also  6  independent nodes in that area.   Attempts  to  convince
     those  nodes  to come into the net voluntarily  had  failed,  and
     under  mandate from the Zone coordinator,  the RC instructed that
     those  members were to be included in the Network  nodelist.   In
     the same paragraph, there was another indication and reference to
     an  internal network dispute that needs no further  clarification
     here.

     Point 3:   In paragrph 3 of Mr. Riddle's comments, he states that
     the *C's proposed internet gateway policy document was created in
     an atmosphere of "narrow-minded and short-sighted,  arguably ego-
     tripping conduct".   Such comments are really  counterproductive.
     A  lot  of  work  and  thought went into  the  creation  of  this
     document.

     Point  4:   There as never been any real proof that the vote  was
     flawed,  and  no one complained as long as the vote was going  to
     their liking.   Further, Mr. Riddle offers no proof that the vote
     was flawed.  If the Board of Directors of a SEPARATE organization
     decides to put a resolution to the sysops, and a majority of them
     decide  to ignore it,  then I find nothing flawed in  it,  except
     that it did not turn out to Mr. Riddle's advantage.

     FidoNews 7-05                Page 23                  29 Jan 1990


     Point 5:  I'm not going to comment on the debate excerpts the Mr.
     Riddle chooses to publish.   I think that they show even  further
     that  his  comments  actually  have very little to  do  with  the
     viability  or  non-viability of the  Internet  Gateway  Document.
     What  we have here is another 'Fidonet sysop' complaining   about
     the age old complaint,  "that we have no say".   This is hogwash.
     There  is  a  complaint and appeal process clearly  written  into
     POLICY 4.   If a *C at almost any level refuses to listen,  there
     is  ALWAYS the opportunity to go to the next higher  level.   Mr.
     Riddle  has  the  opportunity of seeking  membership  in  another
     network if he chooses.  I should note that he is not even a  full
     Fidonet  node,  but  a  point  off of  285/666.   Not  that  this
     diminishes  his  right to comment,  and yes,  I DID  invite  this
     comment.    However,  I  must  confess,  I  had  hoped  for  some
     constructive criticism of the Gateway document, not a diatrabe on
     the *c structure, and its supposed evils.

     People  were  clamoring for democracy.  They 'DEMANDED' that  the
     sysops be given a choice on matter.   Yet,  when the sysops  were
     given  a choice,  we saw the result.   Most of the sysops did not
     even bother to cast their ballots.  We've seen that democracy CAN
     work.  However, it won't work in Fidonet without participation by
     the  sysops,  any better than it works anywhere else without  the
     participation of the electorate.

     Regional Netmail Routing
     -------- ------- -------

     (Published For the Zone 1 Coordinator and RCs by 1:286/703.)

     The Zone 1 Coordinator and the Zone 1 Regional Coordinators would
     like to announce the creation of what we hope will be  a  helpful
     service  to the sysops in FidoNet Zone 1.  The service is not new
     to FidoNet but is new to Zone 1.

     In a significant number of cases, it really shouldn't matter if a
     netmail message is delivered in 5 minutes  or  5  days.  The  Z1C
     connects  with  each Zone 1 RC and with the Zone 2/3/4/5 zonegate
     nightly.  The Zone 1 RC's connect with  each  of  their  NC's  at
     least  twice  each  week  on FidoNews and Nodediff nights.  These
     already established connections could easily be utilized to offer
     routing services  for  low  priority  netmail  addressed  to  any
     FidoNet destination. That is precisely what we've done.  Although
     this  is  currently  labeled a "pilot project",  we can currently
     forsee no reason why it could not be implemented permanently.

     FidoNet sysops in Zone 1 may feel free to route any low  priority
     netmail to any FidoNet Z1RC or to the Z1C.  You should understand
     that "low priority" means that you don't care if it takes up to 5
     or  6 days for the message to arrive at its ultimate destination.
     The transfer from RC to ZC to RC  (or  to  zonegate)  would  take
     place fairly rapidly.  However,  the speed with which the message
     is delivered to the NC will vary from region to region based upon
     how often RC connects with the  NC  (i.e.  Friday  &  Monday  for
     Nodediff's  and  FidoNews or until the NC and RC connect for some
     other purpose).  NC's are invited to participate in this plan and
     provide outbound low priority netmail routing (via the RC).  NC's
     please understand we said "invite" not  "insist".  That  decision
     us up to you and your network sysops.

     Zone 1,  feel free to use or ignore this offer as you please.  We
     hope that this plan will,  as but one example,  provide  echomail
     users  with  an  incentive to take message threads that stray off
     topic "to netmail". Yes, we could be deluged with so much traffic
     that our  collective  pocketbooks  could  not  bear  the  strain.
     However, we prefer to trust the sysops of FidoNet and their users
     to use this service judiciously and responsibly.

     The regional routing plan is, to be sure, not mandated by Policy.
     It  was  simply  something that seemed to make sense and has been
     voluntarily implemented.  We hope  that  this  proposal  will  be
     received  in  the  spirit  in  which it is offered.  That being a
     sincere effort to provide a service we  feel  we  can  afford  to
     those  we  serve.  If  it doesn't work out we are surely no worse
     off than we are today.  If it does, perhaps we can say we brought
     netmail "out of the closet" and made it widely available  to  the
     sysops and (more significantly to the) users in Zone 1.

                    SCSI SYSTEM ONE: A SYSOP'S SCSI SYSTEM


     SCSI System One: The History
     ----------------------------

             One  of the most frustrating problems I have found  since
     switching  my BBS system over to a PC based computer is the  PC's
     inherent  inability to deal with large HD storage spaces.  (While
     this problem has been remedied to some degree with the advent  of
     DOS 4.x, the hardware problem of multiple hard drive storage on a
     single PC still exists.) This article is the story of some  folks
     who decided that "enough was enough" and did something about it.

             About a year back, I became an SDS node and found  myself
     facing  the  situation of needing more hard drive storage  on  my
     system.  Not being the kind of person who could afford to go  out
     an plunk down $6000 for a brand new  super-duper-800-megabyte-12-
     millisecond-Super-Seeker  hard drive, I decided that it was  time
     to  start  looking for some other reasonable way to break  the  2
     hard drive barrier on the PC. I quickly found that I wasn't alone
     in my quest. A handful of other local sysops had been faced  with
     this same problem too. Enter Jeff Lengel.

             Jeff  is a local computer consultant, hardware  engineer,
     software hacker, and long time friend. We started discussing  the
     problem  last  January and decided that there was  just  no  good
     system available to fill the need for multiple hard drive storage
     at  the time. We had pretty much decided that SCSI was the  route
     to go, but at that time commercial SCSI systems for PCs were few,
     and  those  that were affordable for sysops on  our  budget  were
     basically  non-existant.  Jeff said that he had  seen  some  good
     prices on SCSI hardware available through some mail order vendors
     and that it should be possible to put together a software package
     to  make  it all fly. None of us knew it at the  time,  but  SCSI
     System One was born right there.

             Needless to say, Jeff found that writing the SCSI  driver
     code  was  a  bit more than a trivial task.  He  started  out  in
     assembler, but the code eventually out grew his ability to manage
     it.   So he converted all utilities over to C, leaving the driver
     in assembler  for speed.   As time  went by,  Jeff got  the basic
     driver  code  finished.   This  allowed  him to start testing the
     SCSI controller hardware.

            By June, he had  a working SCSI  driver which  would allow
     the PC to talk to  the SCSI devices  through a host adaptor card.
     Once the driver was working correctly, he started to refine it to
     work with various multi-tasking  and BBS packages.  He also added
     the ability to use bridge controllers  to the system. This opened
     up the door  for getting all those old retired  ST506 type drives
     out of the closet and back online again.

             This  is the point where my job started... Jeff needed  a
     few  beta testers (guinea pigs?) to iron out the remaining  flaws
     in the driver. And of course there was that burning question that
     still  needed to be answered: "Would the SCSI driver  really  run
     reliably with all that mailer/BBS software loaded on top of  it?"
     I   volunteered  to  test  it under DOS  3.3  while  Mike  Stroud
     (1:151/102.0) volunteered to test it  under DOS 4.x. Between  the
     two of us, we managed to thrash it pretty well.  This helped Jeff
     work out the few remaining kinks in the driver.

             "So  where are we today?", you ask. Well, today  we  have
     five  systems  in  net 151 now running a Scsi  System  One  on  a
     day-to-day  basis. Jeff has continued to improve the SCSI drivers
     transfer  rate and support for as many bridge adapters as he  can
     possibly find. At the same time, he has managed to develop a  150
     megabyte  automatic  streaming  SCSI  tape  backup  system.  This
     addition to the his base system is a real sysops dream! It can be
     left  to run unattended in the wee hours of the  morning  through
     use  of  an  errorlevel  exit  and  will  automatically   preform
     incremental backups of your system while you sleep. It can backup
     a 100 megabyte drive in file-by-file mode in about 16 minutes and
     can be tailored, through use of a CFG file, to backup  individual
     files, subdirectories, or complete drives. Jeff's also working on
     adding  disk  mirroring  and  a LAN link  package  for  a  future
     release.

             It's  really hard to believe that just about a  year  ago
     this  was all a pipe dream floating around in the heads of a  few
     local  folks. Today, thanks to a little hard work  and  extremely
     patient  wives,  it's a reality. That just goes to  show  that  a
     little collaboration between sysops can go a long way!

     The system consists of one host adaptor card (half  sized  card),
     partitioning/low-level   formatting  software  and  SCSI   device
     driver.  A  three  foot  SCSI  interface cable  is  included.  It
     requires at least DOS 3.2 or higher.

          Jeff  has agreed that in an effort to aid the growth of  the
     'BBS  Network'  he will offer the SCSI System  One  host  adapted
     system  to net sysops at a special rate. For more details on  the
     sysop offer, contact Jeff Lengel at the address below.

                     Announcing the DRUM_CORPS echo
                     ------------------------------

     DRUM_CORPS is an echo for chewing the  rag  about  competitive
     drum & bugle corps, marching bands, and Winter  color  guards.
     It's on the backbone via the Eastern Star and is moderated  by
     yours truly. If you've ever played in a  drum  corps,  college
     band, high school marching band, or marched in a Winter  color
     guard, this is the place for you!

     I've had a great deal of experience in  drum  corps  over  the
     years, having taught them, played with  them,  run  them,  and
     been a spectator too. And we're looking for other with similar
     experience and interests.

     During the competition season, we'll have scores  &  schedules
     and general  BS  from  other  drum  corps  freaks  around  the
     country. So ask your NEC to pick up DRUM_CORPS and join us!
