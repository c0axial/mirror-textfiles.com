     FidoNews passes another milestone as this, the six hundreth Issue, is
     published.

     There were years where 52 were not published and there was the
     composite Issue of 5 Jul 96 wherein I caught up the missing numbers
     of the past Editor in one lump. I don't count any Issues that didn't
     achieve actual, physical status as an existing file. I counted every
     FidoNews file in the archives and this is number 600, right here.

     It has been nearly twelve years since FidoNews started under the
     fingers of FidoNet's progenitor, Tom Jennings. For the 600th Issue,
     the History section will contain Editorials past from the previous
     Editors as a reflection of where we've been, where we are, and where
     we should be headed.

     Congratulations, FidoNews!

     **=*=**

     Complete topic change - FidoNews is going to ZIP format for weekly
     distribution beginning in FOUR weeks with the 30 Sep 96 Issue 1340!

     PLEASE PAY ATTENTION TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT if you never read another
     word here. You have FOUR weeks to adjust your batch files and Tick
     throughputs before they begin choking on the new extension of .ZIP
     instead of .LZH!!

     When 1340 comes out it will come out as: FNEWSD40.ZIP. Don't get
     caught unaware and complain about not knowing why your batch files
     don't work on FidoNews anymore.

     After the survey, it was obvious that ZIP was the preferred format and
     the format with the most platforms. It is also the defacto archiver on
     the Internet as well as producing smaller and faster archives.

     ALL Coordinators are requested to repeat this bulletin to those Nodes
     under their auspices so everyone is on the same page come Issue 1340
     on 30 Sep 96. Thanks, in advance, for your assistance and cooperation.

     **=*=**

     Your FidoNews Editor will be moving at the end of this month. This
     be a physical move on all levels changing Node numbers [1:1/23 will
     still be valid but have a new phone number] and counties and cities.
     We will be going upstate a few miles to Edgewater_FL and be leaving
     Net 374 for independent Node status as 1:18/14 [my first Node number
     from the dim time]. The P.O. Box will also be changing in the contact
     info in the Masthead. The specifics will be forthcoming in a future
     Issue. Please get ready for that, too.

     ZEC2 has a lengthy article in this Issue about a new Zone 2 Echopol.
     All those affected please take note. Other Zones might want to pay
     attention as well for future reference.

     That's enough news for one Issue. [grin]

     A European point of view
     by Fredrik Bennison  --  2:205/300, lomaxx@dalnet.se

     Last night I had a great article in my head but decided to sleep on it
     to get it all sorted out.  Today the idea has evaporated into the
     great unknown we call sleep.  But as I think I know what I wanted to
     say, I thought I'd try writing an article anyway.

     It's sad to see the discussion regarding echomail in FIDONEWS the past
     week.  More and more absurd objections are brought up, like whether
     being tried for murder in a criminal court can justify
     excommunication or not.  What has happened to common sense in Fidonet,
     Fidonet is not governed by law like other parts of our society, it
     depends on the good will, common sense and cooperation of individual
     sysops across the globe.  Disrupting the net in an 'excessively
     annoying' way constitutes reason enough for excommunication.  What is
     excessively annoying is left to the discretion of the *C structure.
     That is one of the reasons that they are there.

     The next subject I'd like to mention is echomail and the *C
     jurisdiction over it.  P4 clearly states that in policy disputes,
     echomail is considered another flavour of netmail, and therefore
     covered by Policy.  Which to me clearly states that actions that would
     be deemed annoying in netmail does not automatically become null and
     void just because they appear in echomail.  In my opinion, there are
     several scenarios in echomail that would constitute excessively
     annoying behaviour and warrant action from the *C structure.  But as
     with so many other things in our beloved Policy, that can be disputed
     and ignored.

     Which brings me to the third (and final) topic for the day.  Policy 4.
     It is now more than 7 years old and outdated and obsolete in several
     ways, of which echomail is one.  At the time (1989) echomail was
     considered secondary to netmail and echomail was not to impair the
     performance of the network as a whole.  Today, the bulk of mail
     passing through Fidonet is in the form of echomail and I feel that
     that needs to be addressed in a new version of Policy.

     Another thing that really should be made more clear is netmail routing
     policies.  Routing netmail is (and has been for as long as I can
     remember) a given right for members of Fidonet Region20, and I guess
     for most of Zone2.  Netmail routing in Zone1 however seems to be
     haphazard at best.  One can never know if a netmail will reach it
     destination, or which networks disallow routing altogether.  A new
     Policy should impose that requirement on the *C structure, that they
     must allow both inbound and outbound routing to their network.
     Preferably by some acknowledged paths like NC -> RC -> ZC and back
     down again.

     Oh well, this article ended up a bit longer than I expected, but I
     hope that I have managed to stir up some emotions and responses to my

     opinions, I welcome ideas and constructive criticism.

     Borlan Turbo C Large/Huge model difftime() bug

     Fredric L. Rice (frice@stbbs.com)
     The Skeptic Tank (1:102/890.0) (818) 335-9601

     I ran into a problem a couple of years ago when I was working on
     a software project in Holland and rediscovered it again tonight.
     Since I didn't make a note of it, I didn't avoid another length
     session of table pounding.

     The problem was that after executing my program in a DOS window,
     Windows 3.1 would exit to DOS every time I hit Control-ESC or
     Alt-ENTER to return to the Desktop.

     Naturally I suspected something funny with my code so I dropped
     exit() calls in the main() to isolate the problem yet the problem
     couldn't be isolated that way.  Eventually I commented-out
     sections of the code until the problem went away which allowed me
     to isolate the faulty code.

     What was damn strange was the fact that the faulty code wasn't
     even being executed -- it would cause this strange behavior in
     Windows 3.1 simply by existing in the executable file.

     A call to Borlan's difftime() function compiled for either the
     Huge or Large memory model caused the problem.  The difftime()
     library code for Huge and Large, I would guess, generates code
     that links strangely -- perhaps code gets byte aligned or some
     other silly nonsense.

     Has anyone else run into this and know what's wrong with the
     library function?  As it is I remembered replacing the call with
     a call to labs().

     What is a PUBLIC KEY?
     An Inquiry Concerning Fidonet Nomenclature

     Author:  Allen McBroom, 1:361/206

     Having recently had the good fortune (or misfortune) of being
     appointed the position of NC for 1:361, I was suddenly introduced to
     the marvels of FidoNews.  While I've enjoyed every edition that's
     found it's way over the phone line to our system, I've been curious
     about some of the terms used by LTFS (Long Term Fido Savvy) authors.

     FIDONEWS 13-36               Page 5                    2 Sep 1996


     Every edition has contained a reference to a "Public Key", which
     seems to be a matter of some import to many readers of FidoNews.
     I've no clue as to what a Public Key is, and even less of a notion as
     to whether I should be worried about my inadequate FNRE (FidoNet
     Relevent Education).  Would someone be so kind as to enlighten me?

     This Is What a Public-key Is

     Christopher Baker, ISMH [temp]
     Rights On! 1:374/14

     Allen McBroom asks: "What is a public key?"

     Well, Allen, without a complete introduction to the mechanics and
     types of encryption systems, a brief answer to your question is as
     follows:

     Public-key cryptography differs from standard password encryption by
     being a two-part system. When most folks think of encryption, they
     think of spies coding documents with cipher keys like passwords or
     passages from books or machines that take in streams of apparent
     nonsense and put out cogent text at the other end. Standard encryption
     is a one-part system where both ends must have the matching decoders.

     Public-key cryptography is a two-part system where the originator has
     two keys. One is a secret-key that is never revealed and is used
     locally to decrypt incoming traffic created using his/her public-key.
     The public-key is the visible and released part of the key pair that
     anyone can use to send encrypted traffic to the key holder. The sender
     has no need to have the secret-key because the necessary parts for the
     sender are contained in the released public-key.

     The public-key system allows the holder to post his/her public-key
     anywhere so it may be used to either encrypt traffic to the holder or
     to verify the signature of the holder on a publicly signed [called
     clear-signed in the vernacular] document including messages and files.

     In the case of the FidoNews public-key, it was produced by the program
     known as Pretty Good Privacy by Phil Zimmerman. PGP is available for
     most platforms and is the most powerful authenticity tool available to
     ordinary folks today. You do not need PGP to read a clear-signed
     document since the text is in 'the clear', i.e. openly readable. You
     only need PGP to verify the authenticity of the signature. The
     signature encloses the document to which it is affixed and will
     indicate immediately any tampering with any part of the document or
     signature. If, for some reason, you wish to send something to the
     FidoNews Editor that can only be read by the FidoNews Editor, you can
     use the FidoNews public-key and PGP to encrypt your traffic to that
     public-key. The operation of PGP is well outside this brief answer.

     If you want more information on public-keys or PGP or related privacy
     issues, please join us in the PUBLIC_KEYS Echo available on the Zone 1

     Backbone and elsewhere.

     I hope this hasn't confused the issue. [grin]

                          THE FIRST FIDONET NEWSLETTER

                     Well, it finally got done ... FidoNews, the FidoNet
             Users Group newsletter is real. It will be published once a
             week, possibly once every two weeks if it gets busy.

                     There will be at least three regular "features": the
             node list, Fido list, and the route list. Hopefully there
             will be more interesting things later. Now you have a reason
             to get FidoNews.

                     I, Tom Jennings, am apparently the editor. I do NOT
             wish to be editor; the last thing I need is something else
             to do. See the HELP WANTED section. (Not kidding)

                     We (ahem) are also looking for a publisher; I will
             do that for a while at least. A freebie outgoing host would
             be nice. Not a short term problem, though, like finding an
             Editor in Chief is.

                     *All* articles, etc are user submitted; anything and
             everything, as per usual Fidonet protocols (Which isn't
             saying much ..) Ideas, problems, questions, tips, programs,
             hardware, etc etc are all welcome. See the ARTICLE article.
             (sic)

                     Distribution is still up in the air; it will be
             mailed to at least six hosts across the country. For now, it
             is available on #1 and #51. Possibly elsewhere in this thing
             you'll find an article on distribution.

                              THE FIDONET USERS GROUP

                     Oh yeah, I did mention that ... I hereby declare all
             Fido users and sysops members of the FidoNet Users Group.
             Sounds pretty stupid, huh? Well ... If there are 100 Fido
             systems around the country, and each has at least 100 users,
             that's 10,000 people. Any group that large has advantages, if
             nothing other than letters to the editor of your favorite
             magazine. This is just a brainstorm at this point, but is

             something to keep in mind.

                     To make this fake club at least appear real, I am
             trying to decide whether or not to have bumper stickers
             made. This will be 3 3/4" X 8 1/2" white vinyl, with black
             artwork, will have the requisite doggie, the words "FidoNet
             Bulletin Board Network" and "Fido Node #" on it, and a place
             for a phone number, and blank space. These will cost $165.00
             for 500 stickers, or about $230.00 for 1000. I'll pay part
             of it ($40.00?) but no more; if I get promises to buy say
             $125.00's worth, I'll have them made, and sell them at cost.
             (They cost about 34 cents each; plus 20 cents postage, plus
             envelopes, etc, call it a buck a piece.)

                     The real reason for this is so I can have one, but I
             don't want to spend $165 for it!

             This is my last editorial, yeah! Thom Henderson at
     FidoNode #375 is taking over as Head Procrastinator. Thom
     has an article here.

             Please note that this means you submit articles to
     him, not me. You can FidoNet them, or upload them manually.
     The latter will probably be a lot easier than spending hours
     and hours trying to autodial into Fido #1.

             Good luck to Thom, and thanks. Thanks also to the
     others who volunteered for Procrastinator duty, it is
     appreciated greatly.

             No editorializing here today; I wrote a whole
     article instead. There are a lot of changes coming soon.

             This also means that I'll be able to WRITE ARTICLES
     instead of having to MUNGE ARTICLES. Currently, I cringe
     when I think about the newsletter; usually it's 10 PM on
     Monday night when I think about it, and have to work on it
     then. Ecch! I'll probably write more now that I don't have
     to. (?)

             That's me.  This is my first issue as editor of Fidonews.
             Since you are reading this, then obviously I've at least
             figured out how to put the paper together.  So far, so good.

             I've already made a few changes, but almost all of them are
             internal things, dealing with how Fidonews is assembled, and
             shouldn't really affect anyone but me.  No big deal, really.
             Everyone develops their own methods for doing things.  Tom
             Jennings and I have developed different methods, is all.

             My short range goal is to totally automate the production of
             Fidonews, so that it will get out on time even if I'm out of
             touch for awhile.  This should be no big problem, as long as
             contributors abide by the submission standards (above).
             This is really more your newsletter than mine, anyway.  I
             just put together the pieces and send it out, maybe with a
             little note from me to you tucked away somewhere.

             So don't think of this as "my" paper, or even as Fido's
             paper (pun NOT intentional).  Think of it as YOUR paper.

                          Time Flies When You're Having Fun

          I've been editing this newsletter for over two years now.  Why do
          I keep doing it?  At least partly  because  it  isn't  that  much
          bother.   As   long  as  everyone  goes  along  with  the  simple
          guidelines given in ARTSPEC.DOC,  which almost everyone does,  it
          pretty much takes care of itself.  Meanwhile,  every now and then
          I get to sound off in one of these editorials.  By and large it's
          been fun,  and when it hasn't been fun at least it hasn't been  a
          bother.

          I  have  a long history of running newsletters.  I was the editor
          of my high school newspaper (a real fishwrapper if there ever was
          one), and I was a shoo-in for the job.  Way back in sixth grade I
          started the first newsletter in the whole school. [The school was
          in its first year when I was in sixth  grade.  It  covered  first
          through  twelfth,  and  had about 300 people when I graduated.  I
          graduated in a class of eighteen.  Growing up  in  a  small  town
          does have its advantages.]

          Writing  these  editorials  seems to give me a different slant on
          things that I normally have.  I feel as if I'm  taking  something
          of  a  longer  view.  I  have  this conception of FidoNet as some
          great and glorious mechanism to allow ordinary people  (well,  as
          ordinary as BBS users ever get) to reach out to each other.  When
          I sit down to write an editorial I remember that view,  and I try
          to talk about it.  And who knows?  Maybe I even make a difference
          in some small way.  If so, then it's certainly worth it.

     FIDONEWS 13-36               Page 10                   2 Sep 1996


          Do you share my vision?  I hope  so.  Yes,  we  have  our  little
          squabbles.  But take any three people and sit them down, and they
          will  have  their  differences of opinion.  We have much the same
          situation,   only  on  a  larger  scale  and  vastly   amplified.
          Sometimes  it  can  seem  almost  too much to bear.  But remember
          this: Nobody ever guaranteed you that everyone would always agree
          with you.  There will always be those (not always the same  ones)
          who  disagree  with your viewpoint.  That is the price we pay for
          such unparalleled freedom of expression.  In return for having so
          many people hear your  viewpoint,  you  must  pay  the  price  of
          hearing  viewpoints  from  those  who disagree with you.  You can
          refuse to pay that  price,  but  then  your  own  voice  will  be
          silenced.

          We  really do want to hear from you.  So some people may disagree
          with you.  Maybe some of  them  will  even  descend  to  personal
          invective.  Just  remember,  the  same  is  true  of any personal
          contact.  That is a price you must pay to make your voice heard.

          =================================================================


               Much to my surprise I received a message from Thom Henderson
          a few weeks ago. It wasn't that he had sent the message that took
          me so  much by surprise as the message's contents. He was looking
          for a new editor for FidoNews and was "offering" me the position.

               Let me say up front that it took me several  days to finally
          come to  a decision.  It wasn't  an easy  decision to  make! As a
          semi-regular columnist I had  it  easy.  If  I  didn't  feel like
          writing or  didn't have  the time  it was no big deal, although I
          did have to live with the guilt it  caused (and  yes, I  did feel
          guilty when  I didn't get a column out). As editor it would be my
          responsibility to the net to make sure that an issue  of FidoNews
          did go  out every  week, regardless  of what my work schedule was
          like or my personal feelings. Only after I was sure  I could take
          on the  responsibility did  I check  to make  sure I could do the
          work required. This may sound backward but I  was reasonably sure
          that if  I decided to shoulder the responsibility, I could manage
          the work. In the end, I decided that it was "the right thing."

               For the  time  being  there  shouldn't  be  any  real change
          apparent  to  most  of  you.  I  am  continuing  Thom's policy of
          printing  anything  I  receive  (outside  of  obvious plagiarism,
          libel, or  criminal intent).  I am  going to  try and take a more
          active role in getting material. Many of you will be hearing from
          me in  the near future in this regard! What kind of articles am I
          interested in? Well first off, I'd like to see someone take up my
     FIDONEWS 13-36               Page 11                   2 Sep 1996


          old "Regular Irregular Column." Actually, I'd like to see a large
          group of "contributing editors" spring up in the near future. All
          the title  means as far as I'm concerned is that the person makes
          regular contributions to FidoNews. Not weekly.  Not monthly. Just
          regularly.

               Also, right  now there  are many  new bulletin board systems
          being introduced to the net. I'd like to  see some  articles from
          these "converted"  sysops and their users on what they expect and
          see  in  FidoNet.  What  made   them   decide   to   add  FidoNet
          compatibility to their systems, and how easy (or hard) was it for
          them to learn some of our unique terminology and practices.

               Some other topics I'd like to see articles on in  the future
          are Gateways. What are they? How do they work? At FidoCon I heard
          some of the possible uses of  EchoMail, is  anyone doing anything
          new and  exciting? Tell us about it if you are. There are several
          public   service   EchoMail   conferences,   are   they  actually
          accomplishing anything?  Also, what is the EchoMail backbone? How
          do you "link up" with it. Some of these are  questions that every
          sysop asks at one time or another, and it would be a big asset if
          everyone could point to and read  a good  article on  topics like
          these.

               If you  think you'd  like to  write something but are unsure
          how it would be received, drop me a line and we'll discuss it. In
          addition to  my electronic  address (which is now a public board,
          no more routing worries) I'm listing  my home  and work addresses
          and phone  numbers. I'm  also interested  in hearing  from you on
          topics for articles you'd  like to  see. Who  knows, maybe  I can
          find someone to write them!

               In summary,  I'd like  to say  that I  am very excited about
          this  new  position  and  hope  that  I  can  live  up   to  your
          expectations. I  plan on  taking a more active role than Thom did
          in that I'm going to be  a little  aggressive in  getting some of
          you  to  write  an  article  instead of just posting a message in
          EchoMail. EchoMail is fickle, many people  may not  see a message
          that directly  pertains to them. Why not enter a message AND send
          in an article, after all this is YOUR newsletter!

          Your Editor,
          Dale Lovell

          Hello there. I've been meaning to write a little something here
          for several weeks now and just haven't gotten around to it.
     FIDONEWS 13-36               Page 12                   2 Sep 1996


          Maybe next week I'll find the time.

          The major reason that I decided to key in anything at all this
          week was to let you know that next week we will publish responses
          to the Policy4 issue of FidoNews.  As  it appears that these
          responses are on  the  LONG  side,  the odds are that we won't
          publish any other articles next week,  though  whether we publish
          columns or not will be a function of how much space the articles
          take up.

          Thanks for reading this rag.  I think it's a  pretty good one. By
          the way, feel free to help keep it that way by sending along some
          material for publication.

          Cheers,

          =================================================================

                    It's time to speak out on Freedom of the Press

          As many of  you  have no doubt noticed, FidoNews isn't a rigidly
          controlled publication.  Its content often has little or nothing
          to do with the day-in,  day-out  nonsense  involved  in  being a
          member of FidoNet.  There are  articles  and discussions of some
          amazingly varied topics, reflecting the similarly  varied tastes
          of the five thousand member nodes of FidoNet.

          I  personally  believe  that it is  a  major  strength  of  this
          publication that any member of FidoNet is  allowed to contribute
          to a publication that is made available to every other member of
          FidoNet.  It is, quite literally, a free and  open  public forum
          in which any of us can share anything we consider important with
          anyone else.

          Of  course, there is a "down" side to this openness.   The  down
          side  is this:  not every issue of FidoNews will be of  interest
          to  everyone  in  FidoNet.  In some cases, there might be one or
          two issues  in  succession  that  in some individuals' opinions,
          would have been  better  off unpublished.  I'm sorry to disagree
          with those people, but this is the price that you pay for having
          your  own  turn  with FidoNews when YOU  want  it.    There  are
          sometimes  excesses,  but we'll gradually learn how to  minimize
          them without hurting the open policy.

          There  now appear to be  some  rumblings  in  the  coordinators'
          structure to the effect that FidoNews has  too  low of a "signal
          to  noise ratio" and that perhaps the  *C's  might  want  to  do
          something about  it.  This is apparently largely due to the fact
          that readership isn't  what  it  used  to be, and many NC's have
          been resisting the idea of carrying FidoNews, which is currently
     FIDONEWS 13-36               Page 13                   2 Sep 1996


          mandated by Fidonet Policy.

          I can't resist the temptation to suggest that indeed we have had
          the  same problem with the *C structure.  How  about  some  more
          signal  and  less  noise  from  them?    Whatever  happened, for
          example, to the promised WEEKLY update from the coordinators via
          the "RegComm -  Communications from RegCon" column?  Well, to be
          fair, it only claimed  to  be a "weekly" update in the January 2
          and January 9 columns.  The January 16 column billed itself as a
          "regular" column.  Of course, it  was  the  last  one submitted.
          When humans get that "regular" they usually need an enema.

          Look, maybe as  an individual you don't always like what appears
          in FidoNews.  But  this  is  YOUR  publication.  YOU decide what
          appears in it through YOUR  submissions.   If you don't like the
          signal to noise ratio, submit something with a high signal level
          and its presence in the  newsletter  will  help  keep that ratio
          closer to where you'd like it.

          At  this  point,  then,  FidoNews  seems  to have reached a very
          important cusp.  We need this open and widely distributed forum.
          The *C's want something that stays a bit closer to the center of
          things.  As yet  there has been no real consensus among the *C's
          on any course of action,  and  this means that the time is right
          for you to be heard on  this  issue.  If you agree that FidoNews
          should belong to ALL of us, then  you had damned well better get
          off your gluteus maximus and write a note  to  your  coordinator
          saying just that.

          Then, while you're in  a  writing  mood, how about submitting an
          article?

          =================================================================
                                      EDITORIAL
          =================================================================

          This is my last Editorial.

          I have resigned as FidoNews Editor. We are currently working our
          way through a "short list" of replacement candidates, and the new
          Editor will be on the job next week.

          Be kind to the poor soul.

          I've just been looking though the indexes for the past two years.
          It's really amazing what we have been through. It's even more
          amazing that we are still here to talk about it.

          For example, when I took over Dale's job as Editor, the current
          version of FidoNet Policy was Version 3. David Dodell was the
          current International Coordinator. IFNA was still trying to
          figure out what, if anything, could be made of its existence.

          I was running my system on a DEC Rainbow. It worked great, too.
          A few other hardy souls were doing similar things on Sanyo and
          Tandy PC's (the ones from before Tandy became the PC-Clone hawker
     FIDONEWS 13-36               Page 14                   2 Sep 1996


          that they are today). Hardly anyone is doing THAT any more!

          POLICY4 was declared to be in force in FidoNews Volume 6, Number
          24, on June 12, 1989. This created a stir because in the absence
          of a formal procedure in POLICY3 for replacement, David used the
          method described in the POLICY4 draft to determine whether he
          should declare it to be in force. Boy, what a stir! There was
          that article in Volume 6, Number 26, entitled "Policy 4: FidoNet
          now a Nazi Dictatorship?". To the best of my knowledge nobody has
          been gassed or blitzed (except metaphorically) in the almost two
          years since.

          David quit at the end of July. I quit two weeks later, then
          changed my mind (with some coercion from friends). It was an
          exciting time to be the Editor. Because the Great IFNA Mandate
          Plebiscite was taking place.

          This was IFNA's final answer to the people who had claimed that
          the simple majority who chose IFNA were not representative. The
          voting rules were simple: if you were in the nodelist running a
          public access system, you were eligible. And a majority of all
          eligible nodes was required to endorse IFNA. If IFNA won the
          election, the critics would be silenced forever. And in a high
          stakes gamble, IFNA agreed to disband if not ratified.

          Did IFNA ever have a chance? Was it the right idea? Who really
          can say anymore? In any event, apathy won the election and IFNA
          was out, as reported in FidoNews Volume 7, Number 1.

          As I look back to 1989, what's really fascinating is that Pablo
          Kleinman was already at work on Worldpol in the immediate
          aftermath of the Policy4 adoption. And he's still at it. He is
          showing signs of getting it right, too. It's just going to take
          some more time.

          Remember Hurricane Hugo? Remember what it did to Mike Ratledge
          and many others in his area? FidoNet reached out and touched
          him in a very special way, and FidoNews was there, starting with
          an article in Volume 6, Number 39 entitled "Let's give Mike
          Ratledge a hand". One of our finest hours. I am proud to have
          been here to see it.

          FidoNews has had its critics too. There was an article in Volume
          6, Number 40 entitled "FidoNews: What IS Its Purpose ?". I have
          my own ideas about that. Fortunately for my peace of mind, it
          will soon be someone else's problem to define that role.

          When the Internetwork Gating Policy was published, there was a
          lot of comment. Mostly negative. I think (speaking as one of
          the people who had some input in the process) that if the
          criticism was directed at alternative solutions to the problems
          addressed in the Policy rather than direct attacks on the entire
          idea of HAVING such a document, we might have accomplished
          something. As things stand, the original document is still in
          force but not strongly enforced. In other words "If you want to
          connect to FidoNet, you could refer to this document and get it
     FIDONEWS 13-36               Page 15                   2 Sep 1996


          right -- or just do it any old way". Sigh. What happened to
          the idea of you don't go wee-wee in my garden and I won't go
          poo-poo in yours?

          We at FidoNews had a great moment in everyone's spotlight too.
          The way things were progressing, it was getting really hard to
          attract your attention anymore. But we found a way. On July 30,
          1990 lots of you woke up to find FidoNews sitting on your system
          in a file compressed with LHARC. Yup, you sure DID notice. I
          think it was probably the most popular topic in FidoNews that
          year. Even with the late start.

          It really pissed off Saddam Hussein too. In less than a week he
          had taken over Kuwait in an attempt to capture the responsible
          parties. After being told that the dirty deed had been done by
          an American, he is reported to have said "An American? OK. I'll
          wait here for him."

          I never made it over there. A lot of very brave folks did. And
          they did a great job. FidoNet was involved too, in its own unique
          way. An article in FidoNews Volume 7, Number 45 announced "The
          Saudi Connection". Numerous articles about the war were
          published. A healthy exchange of opinions ensued. People were
          engaged. It was great.

          We had ZC, RC and EC elections in Zone 1 and elsewhere, as the
          idea of democracy flowered in the Net. Then of course we had the
          great turnout in the Worldpol ratification vote. Electing NC's
          is an idea whose time has come. It should be easier to throw out
          the old slugs than it presently is.

          I sure wish I knew where FidoNet is going these days. The only
          consolation I have is that nobody knows. If anybody tells you
          that he or she DOES know, you can safely call that person a liar.

          Boy, there are some great memories here. And some not so great
          memories. It's been a lot of fun. But I won't miss it. I'll be
          too busy with other things.

          Well, maybe I will miss it. But I promise not to make a scene.

          Best regards,
          Vince

     Times they are achangin'
     by Tom Jennings, Editor (1:1/1)
     FIDONEWS 13-36               Page 16                   2 Sep 1996


     As you may have noticed, Vince Perriello has stepped down from
     editorship of FidoNews. Tim Pozar & I have taken over as editors on
     pretty short notice. We are about to make some substantial changes we
     feel have been necessary for a long time. Some have already been
     implemented.

     The editorial policy was and still is "we publish anything". But what
     that meant was, on any subject. This is an unusual editorial policy,
     but one that I felt was important to the net back in 84 when this all
     started, and I think it is still important.

     In the intervening years, there were two major directions it could
     have gone; the "well we can't have *THAT* in there ..." "and *THAT*
     wasn't what was meant by..." which is the usual route. Then there's
     the way it *did* go -- the harder route of an open policy. It is to
     the great credit of all of the editors that they decided what they
     did.

     The phrase for the problem (which I just discovered a while back) is
     the "slippery slope". Once you start down it, there is no way to turn
     back and no way to tell when to stop.

     To make it crystal clear -- the "rule" that would keep out
     "controversial" christian articles would be the same "rule" that
     would prevent homo-anarchist articles (for instance :-) -- and
     eventually anything else not lowest-common-denominator.

     FidoNews is *not* an L.C.D. trade rag. It has no pretense towards an
     Industry newsletter. It is by and for FidoNet sysops, users and other
     people we consider "members", and I can tell you plain that FidoNet
     is not a monolith, the diversity is incredible and only our institu-
     tional policies prevents this from being clearer.

     FidoNews, like FidoNet, was an experiment, and I believe we can all be
     proud of it's success -- for all the flaming, ill will and trouble we
     go through, we have one of the most reliable, resilient and *fiercely
     independent* organizations on the planet. I wouldn't have it any other
     way! It is not supposed to be easy -- convenience is not a good goal.

     So the policy remains in effect with one change -- there is a minimal
     writing standard, for clarity, not content -- that articles must meet,
     to ensure that they are intelligible to someone other than its author.

     The article-submission guidelines file, ARTSPEC.DOC, has been
     revamped, and is included in this issue of FidoNews as an article. The
     various "departments" of FidoNews will also be changed. "Column" type
     articles are no more; you must submit each one separately. Notices,
     sale items and want-ads will be converted into a more general
     "classifieds" section in the near future.

     The format for FidoNews will change further. The current format is one
     of those things I did in 1984 that is today very puzzling -- an
     electronic newsletter designed to be copied to a printing device! It
     is nearly impossible to read online. It is wasteful of space, on both
     disk and printer. The left margin alone (now gone) accounted for 10%
     of its size. The tentative goal is to keep FidoNews under 100K bytes
     FIDONEWS 13-36               Page 17                   2 Sep 1996


     in size.

     We will be actively soliciting articles from people with interesting
     perspectives in FidoNet and the world beyond on issues and problems
     that face us as a network in the real world. Though we are
     accommodating access to/from other networks such as the Internet and
     uucp, FidoNews will remain 100% a FidoNet newsletter.

     Some time later this year, the format of FidoNews will be plain text
     without pagebreaks, long dash lines and formfeed characters. End-of-
     section markers will be ASCII characters. It will then be readable
     online. All computer systems today have a way to "pretty print" ASCII
     text files, so that is no longer a valid reason.

     Sorry for the terse editorial, we're under a severe time limit to
     learn the software, file conventions and to get an issue out on time.
     By next week things will be under more control, and we can get down to
     the business at hand -- communicating, instead of talking about the
     communications device!

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

     I guess you noticed that there are new names for the "Editors" on the
     Masthead. One you may recognize as the "papa" of this mess, Tom
     Jennings. Well, I'm the other name. My name may be associated with
     another mess, the linking of FidoNet to a network called UUCP and a
     conferencing system called USENET. (*)

     Which brings up the point of this essay. FidoNet users and sysops, for
     the most part, are not aware that there are other networks out there.
     We tend to be a bit ethnocentric in our views of the networking world.
     With the advent of gateways into other networks from RBBS-NET to non-
     fidonet based technologies like UUCP, USENET, and the Internet, we
     need to be more aware of other customs and technologies. (For example,
     not everyone can display the IBM-PC character set, or perhaps we
     should look at the method of our network addressing so it is easier to
     send and receive mail from these other networks. We'll look at these
     things in later issues.)

     To this end, we hope to include more articles that are not only
     related to FidoNet, but to networking and communications as a whole.
     This is not to say that FidoNews will loose it's FidoNet flavor, we
     just want to give the readership an idea on what else is out there,
     and include what Sysops and Users may have some interest in.

     For instance, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Inc. (EFF) is
     working to educate folks (lawyers, law enforcement, policy makers,
     sysops, hackers, and crackers) about the hysteria and misinformation
     that our government and law enforcement agencies seem to be going
     through and trying to spread about electronic communications. Our
     basic civil rights are being affected due to the ignorance of these
     agencies. The EFF is also supporting many of those affected by paying
     or helping with legal costs.

     On other subjects, how many know of the resources that are available
     via the Internet? There are a number of "News" services that can add
     FIDONEWS 13-36               Page 18                   2 Sep 1996


     value to your BBS. There are archives that will easily shadow the
     biggest FidoNet archive sites.

     We just can't hide our head in the sand with all of the potential that
     FidoNet can be, and the threats to FidoNet from the ill informed.

     Editorial: Bye bye!! (boo hoo!)


     Well this is it, my final editorial. Next week's will be edited by
     Silvia Maxwell and Don Tees. Say hi to them. (Hi!)

     Today is a momentous day for me. I'm moving into a new apartment this
     very day, tomorrow my phone lines get swapped over. As soon as I
     finish this, I have to pack more boxes and drag 'em over. We're moving
     from out in the boonies to the heart of the Mission; 16th St between
     Mission and Valencia. The three little holes in my windows turned out
     to be bullet holes! (22 or 25 cal.) The glass is
     double-paned, and I was able to locate the trajectory. Later, I pull
     down the shade, and there's matching holes! Yipes! Oh well, instead of
     a 45 minute walk to the cafe, it's about 120 seconds, a vast
     improvement. No more do I have to pay $1 for a bus, down on the corner
     I can buy a "late nite" (daily bus transfer) for 25 cents! ("I love,
     livin' in the city!" -- FEAR)

     I digress.

     Oh, probably there'll be small mistakes made, but be helpful and nice.
     Our new editors have to decipher my 4DOS batch files, and generate a
     newsletter that's at least recognizable and somehow get it to 1:13/13.
     In a week.

     I look forward to seeing what changes they make. I failed to keep one
     promise, that of revamping the newsletter format from "line printer"
     format to online readable. I really blew the "Ask EFF!" project,
     though Shari Steele is hanging in there raring to go.

     Think back on all the little wars we've had... Zone 2 hassles... Z1C
     "process" or lack of... POLICYx... encryption... I'm begging off just
     in time to miss the "Caller ID" wars -- YAY!!! (You know it's time to
     FIDONEWS 13-36               Page 19                   2 Sep 1996


     leave when...)

     It's been fun, really!! Even the hard parts I learned a lot, about
     taking my lumps when necessary, and staying the hell out of local
     squabbles.

     So ta-ta, I'll see you out in the cloud...

     My BBS is going to go offline for a while, probably a month or two,
     starting this week. I will have an email address however, but it's on
     the Internet. It's

                             tomj@fido.wps.com

     My old DOS machine is now running 386BSD and directly connected to the
     internet. In itself an interesting story, and one you'll probably see
     in these pages and BOARDWATCH magazine.

     Anyways -- you can email me from FidoNet, via certain FidoNet nodes
     flagged "GUUCP". Those are UFGATE sites, that have one foot each in
     FidoNet and Internet. There's a bunch of then. The way it works is
     you send a message to one of those FidoNet addresses, with certain
     magicwords placed within the message itself, that the UFGATE software
     detects. These are: the "to:" field being the single word UUCP. The
     VERY FIRST line of the message formatted exactly as:

     to: tomj@fido.wps.com

     With at least one completely blank line following it. After that, put
     your real message. Make sure you have the address (ie. the to: line
     embedded in the message body) correct, otherwise your message won't
     make it.

     ======================================================================
     Hello World.

     Brand new green editors here.  No  editorial  policy  at  all...
     just  anarchy.   I used  to  have  a  dream  about  how network
     communications would free people from  visually,  geographically
     and  aurally enforced stereotypes like age, gender, nationality,
     class...  but upon reflection of mail this dream seems tame and
     lame.  The image of "everyone in the room, more or less armed to
     the teeth, and no casualties" (thank  you  Tom  Jennings)  seems
     more generative and fun.  Electronic word travel enables a grand
     experiment in reductio ad absurdum of normal human contact  that
     might fly anywhere willed by any one of us.

     It has been a hectic week. Getting software to generate the news
     set up, arranging passwords  and  paths  for  distribution,  and
     setting  up  an  internet gateway so that we can get flames from
     FIDONEWS 13-36               Page 20                   2 Sep 1996


     all directions. I think that everything is ready to go, but will
     apologize  in  advance for the inevitable teething pains. Please
     note the new addresses.

     Last but not least, we would like to thank Tom Jennings for  his
     immense  contribution  to  this  medium, and say "well done". We
     hope, Tom, that we will be seeing contributions  in  the  future
     (after a well deserved rest, of course <S>).

         Once again, there are no articles in the inbound.  I think,
     perhaps, that the writer of a few weeks back was correct.  I

     letters suggesting a new editor.

         The last issue of FidoNews published by Donald Tees appeared on
     27 May 96 [Issue 1322].  Since then nothing has been heard from the
     former Editor.  This issue is a manual composite comprising Issues 23
     through 27 for the sake of numbering continuity and historical
     reference. [see Header]

         FidoNews is now edited by yours truly from 1:374/14, Rights
     On!, in Titusville, FLorida, USA.  The Nodelist adjustment to the
     FidoNews listing will appear in NODELIST.194 next Friday [12 Jul 96].
     In the meantime, you may wish to set a temporary override for 1:1/23
     to reflect the following telephone number: 407-383-1372.  Flag
     override should be: CM,H14,V32B,XA as well.

         FidoNews submissions may be made to 1:1/23 as before or to my
     Internet address: cbaker84@digital.net.  Submission standards are
     available in the file ARTSPEC.DOC from this system anytime except
     Zone 1 ZMH [0900-1000 UTC/GMT].  ARTSPEC.DOC has also been sent to
     every Zone Coordinator for distribution down the chain.  Submissions
     made as Netmail or email require manual processing so allow more lead
     time for the issue in which you wish to have it appear.

         FidoNews Issue 28 will put the standard numbering and submission
     processing back on track for 1996 [Vol. 13].

     FidoNet has come a long way since it began over twelve years ago.
     But how far has it come lately?

     There hasn't been any discernable movement toward selecting an
     International Coordinator [IC] from the current field of 6 Zone
     Coordinators [ZC].  Are we ever going to get one and move along in
     the areas of Policy and Standards?

     As our guest editorial indicates, we don't even have regular updates
     from the other Zones for the master Nodelist.  Where are the diffs
     [Nodelist difference files] from Zones 2-6?  Are they getting ours
     from Zone 1?  This still is an INTERNATIONAL hobby, isn't it?
     Are there any reports from the FTSC [FidoNet Technical Standards
     Committee] on the state of our Standards?  Updates to our practices?
     Presumably, software authors are still at it and things have changed
     in the last couple years, yes?

     Hello, out there!  Here's your vehicle for spreading your news.  How
     about some chiming in from the ZCs and FTSC Chair?  What gives?  Talk

     Six Mail Processors Reviewed [III]
     Damian Walker, 2:2502/666

     This is the third article in my six-part series looking at the
     capabilities of various mail processors.  The first and second
     articles were about FastEcho and GEcho, and in this article I progress
     to FMail.  A full feature table for all six mail processors will be
     included in the sixth and final article of the series.

     FMAIL

         Fmail is a mail processor written by Folkert J Wijnstra of
     2:283/619.  The version reviewed in this article is FMail/X 1.02.
     Unlike the versions of FastEcho and GEcho under review, this version
     of FMail is optimised for 386 processors and above, and so will be
     faster (the 386 test machine) than an 8086 version.  Please take this
     into account when looking at the speed ratings.  Versions for OS/2 and
     8086 DOS machines are also available.

     First Impressions

         Upon first unpacking FMail, its compactness is noticeable.  One
     could be forgiven for thinking that FMail might be underfeatured when
     looking at the size of its archive (if one judges a package by such
     things, that is).  While FMail doesn't have the exhaustive range of
     features possessed by FastEcho and IMail, it certainly couldn't be
     described as under-featured.
         The manual seems rather small at 54 pages.  Although you would
     expect the manual to be smaller than that for larger packages such as
     FastEcho, comparing it to GEcho's manual of around 100 pages shows
     that this might be a cause for adverse comment.  But this is without
     taking the content of the manual into consideration-- size isn't
     everything.
         Looking at the directory of newly unpacked files we see that FMail
     contains a full-screen setup utility (FSETUP.EXE or FSETUPX.EXE), so
     configuration by those who do not like editing text files will not be
     a problem.

     On Further Examination...

         The first interesting thing to point out about FMail is that it
     doesn't support *.MSG areas for echomail.  This will probably not be
     counted against FMail by most sysops, as echomail is rarely held as
     *.MSG areas on a DOS machine. Squish is not supported either, but the
     common Hudson and JAM areas are both supported, so while FMail's
     coverage of area types isn't fully comprehensive, it is enough for
     most needs.
         FMail's setup program offers a nice interface in the usual Fidonet
     program style.  The only thing lacking is an on-line help system, so
     if you're not using a multitasking machine and you want to look
     something up, you will have to exit FSETUP, and re-load it again
     FIDONEWS 13-36               Page 23                   2 Sep 1996


     afterwards (hoping you can remember whatever it was you looked up).
     Needless to say, some form of on-line help would be an improvement,
     even if it was only a manual viewer like that used by GEcho.
         Like most of the other programs reviewed here, FMail includes its
     own areafix manager, allowing downlinks to fix into echoes and
     automatically forwarding requests to an uplink if necessary.
     Unfortunately it lacks the 'import description' facilities of GEcho
     and FastEcho, so if you wish to set up a large number of areas
     manually, you will need to find and type their descriptions
     individually.
         FMail has a feature which automatically adds areas to the
     configuration files for itself and other software.  Rather than being
     added on the fly as FastEcho does it (ie. adding areas as mail is
     being processed), FMail waits until the next time you enter its setup
     program, and then asks you if you want to add the areas.
         This has the disadvantage that the process is not fully automatic,
     but it has the advantage that the process is not fully automatic :-)
     In more serious terms, the FastEcho method is better for sysops who
     would like to set up defaults and allow their system to automatically
     add new echoes to the area database without the need for human
     intervention, whereas FMail's method encourages more control over the
     adding of new areas so you can be sure that areas are not being added
     unless you want them to be.
         The carbon copy feature, while not as flexible as that used by
     FastEcho, is a cut above normal personal mail options in that you can
     also direct mail to your 'personal' directory which contains up to two
     keywords in the subject line.  It also has an option to include the
     netmail area in the scan.
         Sysops can thus take a special interest in messages about their
     BBS or node, moderators can do the same for their echo and software
     authors can monitor opinion of their programs, all aided by FMail's
     automatic scanning of subject lines.
         The only downside of this feature is that it appears only to allow
     *.MSG areas for personal mail (the option specifies a _directory_ but
     there is no mention of a Hudson Message Board or JAM path).
         One surprising and possibly limiting aspect of FMail is in the
     fact that the 8086 version can hold only 512 echoes.  If you want to
     have all available echoes in your area database (as I do) then 512
     might not be enough; I believe the zone 1 backbone has more echoes
     than this, as does the Region 25 backbone which is more local to me.
     If you are also active in other networks, this limit can make you feel
     a bit claustrophobic.  The 386 version has more comfortable space for
     4096 echoes, which should be enough unless you take newsgroups and
     want to list all 18,000 or so.
         FastEcho shares with GEcho the option of moving the netmail marked
     as Rcvd and Sent to special message areas (albeit only to *.MSG areas
     in FMail's case).  Unlike GEcho's similar option, sent/received file
     attaches will not be moved.  However, FMail has the extra option of
     copying sent echomail messages as well as netmails; this is a handy
     way of keeping track of what you've said to whom (useful in flame
     wars, perhaps?)
         One useful feature that FMail has is the option to reroute netmail
     to points.  Traditionally a task performed by netmail trackers, its
     inclusion in FMail allows sysops to forego the pleasure of setting up
     a separate netmail tracker if this is the only netmail tracker style
     feature they need.  Of the packages reviewed here, only Squish shares
     FIDONEWS 13-36               Page 24                   2 Sep 1996


     this feature.
         Speed is one feature which FMail has above all the other packages
     tested, although one has to bear in mind that of all the packages
     tested, only with FMail, Squish and IMail have the 386 versions been
     used, so it is only to be expected that these will perform better than
     the 8086 versions of other packages.  Still, comparing the performance
     of FMailX to that of IMail 386, we can see that it is a very
     impressive package.
         In the Hudson message toss test, where 91 messages were imported
     into a newly-created Hudson message base, FMailX completed the task in
     a sprightly 7 seconds.  The same feat performed upon an empty set of
     JAM areas yielded a performance of 12 seconds.
         The documentation is not inadequate, but it does not seem as good
     or comprehensive as that for the two packages already reviewed.  This
     is not too much of a problem as the software is easy to set up (even
     without a help system), but I have experienced difficulty in looking
     up certain features in the manual.
         For instance, I could not find anything about FMail's behaviour in
     creating new areas when mail in unknown areas arrives.  Doubtless it
     is in there somewhere, but neither the contents nor the index (yes,
     there is an index) were any use in finding out what I wanted to know.
     I had to resort to an actual testbed setup in order to find out
     exactly how FMail treats these messages.
         However, the documentation wasn't written with nosy reviewers like
     myself in mind, so perhaps I am judging it from the wrong perspective.

     Summary

         FMail is a compact yet powerful mail processor which should
     satisfy the needs of most sysops with mainstream mail processing
     needs.  Larger echomail hubs may find its limit on the number of
     message areas a little too limiting, yet they, along with other users,
     will find its impressive speed useful for processing large amounts of
     echomail.
         With its auto-add capability for new message areas, points will
     find it an acceptable yet still compact alternative to GEcho (the
     popular choice for power points), allowing them to add areas to their
     whole setup with a single areafix message.
         While a few features, such as a help system for FSETUP and an easy
     way to import descriptions, would not go amiss, it couldn't be said
     that FMail is in desperate need of any major improvements.  As a
     compact, fast, mail processor it is hard to beat.
         Next week comes the fourth article in this series, where I will
     turn my attention to IMail, which is the creation of Andreas Klein.

     PROLOGUE

     This document  sets forth  policy governing  Echomail conferences
     and their distribution.

     For the purposes of this document a simple majority exists when
     one candidate has more votes than any other at the closing date,
     or when a proposal has more votes in favour of it than against
     it. Only the votes of those who actually vote will be counted for
     establishing the total number of votes cast, or for establishing
     whether a simple majority exists.

     This Policy applies to Zone Two Backbone Echomail conferences and
     to any other conferences for which the Moderator desires it to be
     applicable. Future changes to Echo Policy may be proposed only by
     a  simple majority vote of the Regional Echomail Coordinators.

     Those eligible to vote on any proposals made by the REC structure
     will be  the ZEC, RECs, NECs, NCs, RCs and IC.  Only one vote per
     person is  allowed.   Adoption of changes will  require a simple
     majority of those voting to pass.

     A good faith  attempt  must be  made to make all potential voters
     aware that a vote is occurring  and  make available all necessary
     information.


     I.  HISTORY

     Echomail consists  of the sharing of message bases or conferences
     between various  independent network  addresses.    The  Echomail
     concept started  with a  series of  programs by Jeff Rush.  Since
     the original  implementation, many  authors have written programs
     improving on  the original  idea.   In spite  of worries that the
     flow of Echomail would increase Netmail traffic to the point that
     the Network  would collapse  under its  own weight,  Echomail has
     been a  success.   To simplify  the distribution  of Echomail,  a
     Regional Echomail  Backbone formed  whose primary  purpose is the
     distribution  of  Echomail  at  a  Regional  level.    Of  recent
     introduction  to  the  Backbone  system  has  been  the  generous
     contribution of the Echomail Stars.  As a result of the growth of
     Fidonet and the increase in the volume of Echomail, it has become
     necessary to set forth a formal policy governing Echomail.

     II.  DEFINITIONS

     1.   ECHOMAIL:   The process  of sharing  message  bases  between
     independent systems with unique net/node addresses.

     2.   ECHOMAIL CONFERENCES:   An  Echomail conference is a message
     base of  forum design  distributed under  a specified  conference
     name dealing  with a  defined area of interest.  Notable examples
     include TECH,  the National  Technical Conference  and COMM,  the
     National Telecommunications Conference.

     3.   MODERATED CONFERENCE:  A moderated conference is an Echomail
     conference for  which a moderator has been appointed to supervise
     the flow  and content of the conference.  All conferences carried
     on the Backbone must be moderated.

     4.   SYSOP-ONLY CONFERENCE:   A  Sysop-Only Conference  is one in
     which the  Moderator has decided that the conference will be made
     available only to Sysops and not to users.

     5.     RESTRICTED  DISTRIBUTION   CONFERENCES:     A   restricted
     distribution conference  is  one  which  is  restricted  only  to
     eligible  recipients.    Notable  examples  include  REGCON,  the
     Regional Coordinators  Conference, COORD,  the National  Echomail
     Coordinators Conference,  and  MAGICK,  a  pre-register  Echomail
     Conference.

     6.    ZONE  ECHOMAIL  COORDINATOR  (ZEC):    This  individual  is
     responsible for coordination of Echomail on a FidoNet Zone level.

     7.   REGIONAL ECHOMAIL  COORDINATOR (REC):   This  individual  is
     responsible for coordination of Echomail within his region.

     8.     NET  ECHOMAIL  COORDINATOR  (NEC):    This  individual  is
     responsible for coordination of Echomail at the Local Net level.

     9.   ECHOMAIL  Backbone:    The  Echomail  Backbone  consists  of
     voluntary members  who provide  services to  enhance the Regional
     distribution of  Echomail.   The Backbone consists of nodes which
     handle a  high volume of Echomail traffic and are responsible for
     distribution of Echomail down to the regional level.

     10.    REGIONAL ECHOMAIL  LIST:    The  Regional  Echomail  List
     identifies the  available Regional  conferences,  the  conference
     moderator and  requirements of the specified conference.  The REC
     will appoint the keeper of the Regional Echomail List.

     11.   AUTOMATED CENSORSHIP:  The term Automated Censorship refers
     to programs  which cause messages to be removed from the intended
     conference or have their content altered.

     12.   FIDONET POLICY:   The  document which  governs  Fidonet  as
     adopted by  Fidonet.   The document as of this writing is Policy4
     and is  subject to  change.   This policy is intended to become a
     part of  general Fidonet  policy.   Until it is incorporated into
     General Fidonet  policy, this  document  shall  serve  to  define
     FIDONEWS 13-36               Page 28                   2 Sep 1996


     policy violations occurring in Echomail.

     13.  OPEN ACCESS CONFERENCE:  This is a non-restricted conference
     open to all users who are willing to follow the posted conference
     rules.

     14.  TERMINAL NODE:  A system which does not process echomail for
     pickup by another system.


     III.  DUTIES OF ECHOMAIL COORDINATORS

     1.  GENERAL:   It is  the duty  of the  *ECs to make available to
     any  Fidonet  Sysop,  any  conference  which  the  Sysop  is  not
     prohibited from receiving by not meeting requirements as mandated
     by the  conference moderator.  If for any reason the *EC does not
     have access  via recognized  distribution channels  to a specific
     conference, they  can not  be expected  to pass  it on.  If a *EC
     fails  to  make  information available as to where to obtain feeds
     for any  conference  to  qualified  lower distribution levels,  this
     shall  be deemed  to have violated the outlined duties  of the
     position held.   Such violation is cause for a policy complaint of
     Extremely annoying behaviour as defined by Policy4.  An exception is
     when  a *EC  cuts a  link  to  end  unauthorized distribution of  a
     conference.   In  this  case,  some  otherwise authorized nodes may
     temporarily lose their link.


     A *EC shall do everything in their power to ensure that:

          1.   All downstream links are educated as to this policy.

          2.   Downstream  links   know  how  to  properly  link  into
               conferences.

          3.   Acceptable  and   unacceptable  behavior   in  echomail
               conferences is explained.

          4.   Downstream links  are not  engaging in  topologies that
               increase the risk of duplicate messages.


     2.   DUTIES OF  ZONE ECHOMAIL COORDINATOR:  It is the duty of the
     ZEC to  coordinate the  connections between the Echomail Backbone
     on  both   an  inter-Zone   and  intra-Zone   level  as  well  as
     coordination  of   inter-regional  connections.    The  ZEC  will
     coordinate transmission  of Echomail   and to provide for routing
     in a  manner  that  will  avoid  the  transmission  of  duplicate
     messages within  the same conference.  It is also the duty of the
     ZEC to monitor compliance with this policy on both a Regional and
     international basis.


     3.   DUTIES OF  REGIONAL ECHOMAIL COORDINATOR:  It is the duty of
     the REC  to provide  for  regional  Echomail  distribution.    In
     addition, the  REC  will  coordinate  any  inter-regional  cross-
     FIDONEWS 13-36               Page 29                   2 Sep 1996


     linking of  conference feeds  with the  REC of  the participating
     region with  the direct  knowledge of  the ZEC.    The  REC  will
     provide for  transmission and  routing of Echomail within his/her
     region in  a manner  to avoid  creation   of  duplicate  messages
     within the same conference.  It is the duty of the REC to monitor
     compliance with this policy at a regional level.


     4.   DUTIES OF  NET ECHOMAIL  COORDINATOR:  It is the duty of the
     NEC to  coordinate the  intra-net Echomail  and to cooperate with
     the REC  and NECs  of other  nets to  arrange for  the  inter-net
     transmittal of  echomail.  The REC may require the NEC to provide
     links for independent (regional) nodes.  The NEC shall maintain a
     list of  available Echomail Conferences within the net as well as
     the requirements  of each  Conference area  as  supplied  by  the
     conference moderator  (Echolist).   The NEC  shall  also  monitor
     compliance with this policy at a net level.


     5.   DUTIES OF  ECHOLIST COORDINATOR:   It  is the  duty  of  the
     Echolist Coordinator  to compile  and make available a listing of
     regional conferences and optionally, conferences at  various local
     levels.  The content and format of the Echomail  listing shall  be at
     the sole  discretion  of  the Echolist Coordinator,  but shall
     include the conference name and moderator for  each conference.   The
     Echolist Coordinator shall also maintain  a list  of requirements
     applicable to each listed conference.


     6.   DUTIES OF  ECHOMAIL CONFERENCE  MODERATOR:   It shall be the
     duty of  the Echomail  Conference Moderator to make in good faith
     every reasonable  effort to  ensure that the moderated conference
     does not  distribute or promote illegal activities or information
     as defined  below in  Section V Paragraph 2.  The Moderator shall
     be responsible  for  ensuring  that  messages  contained  in  the
     conference corresponds  to the  conference theme.   The Moderator
     shall report any violations of this policy to the proper Echomail
     coordinators and  lodge  any  appropriate  policy  complaints  as
     provided for  in  policy  documents  adopted  by  Fidonet.    The
     Moderator shall  post the  conference rules  in the conference at
     least once  a month.      The   Moderator  is  to  authorize  the
     disconnection of  the conference  feed.   Any Sysop the moderator
     believes is  violating policy  shall be reported to the offending
     node's nearest  local echomail  coordinator (may be a NEC, REC or
     in extreme  situations a  ZEC); and  the moderator shall formally
     authorize the  feed to  the offending  node to  be  severed.  The
     conference moderator  is the  sole judge - subject to review only
     by the next system within the *EC chain, {see note1}
     if a  complaint is  filed by the banished party.  The Moderator may
     request in direct written form (netmail) that  the *ECs  disconnect a
     node from  the conference when that  node refuses  to follow the
     published conference rules after at least 3 warnings.  Knowingly
     feeding  a conference  to a node that  has been  severed by  the
     Moderator  is  considered  a violation of  this echomail  policy and
     is subject to suspension.  The length  of this   suspension  will be
     determined by a joint decision of  the conference  moderator and the
     FIDONEWS 13-36               Page 30                   2 Sep 1996


     NEC of  the node  illegally feeding the conference to the
     original offending node or point.

     Echo conference  complaints from  a Sysop  should be filed at the
     Moderator level first If the sysop is unhappy with the moderators
     decision, then they have the right to continue "up" the *EC chain as
     defined in note1.

     The "Moderator" is in essence the person "owning" the conference,
     and generally the *EC chain will side with that moderator in the event
     of a complaint.  The appeal structure is in place to prevent so-called
     "Vindictive" moderators from denying access for trivial reasons.
     Fidonet is deemed to be a Free and open network, and designed to
     encourage people to take part in echomail, and at that same time
     discourage people from acting in a socially unacceptable manner.
     For severe or chronic infractions  the NEC, REC or ZEC  may  file
     a complaint under general Fidonet policy for excessively annoying
     behaviour.


     IV.   APPOINTMENT  AND  ELECTION  OF  ECHOMAIL  COORDINATORS  AND
     MODERATORS.

     1.   GRANDFATHER CLAUSE:   Those Zone, Regional, and Net Echomail
     Coordinators and  Echomail Coordinators  currently holding  these
     positions as  of the  date of  acceptance of this Echomail Policy
     shall continue  to service  in said capacity until resignation or
     two years has elapsed.

     2.   ELECTION OF  ZONE ECHOMAIL  COORDINATOR:   The ZEC  shall be
     elected as follows:

          a) upon  resignation or replacement of the existing ZEC, the
          FidoNet Zone  Coordinator (ZC)  shall nominate at least five
          individuals to be voted upon.

          b) 10  days after  the nominees  are selected,  an  election
          shall be  held. The ZEC will be elected by a simple majority
          of IC,  ZC, RCs,  NCs, RECs, and NECs in their Fidonet zone.
          An individual  holding more  than one position can only cast
          one vote.  That is, if an individual is both a NC and a NEC,
          they may cast only one vote.

     3.   ELECTION OF REGIONAL ECHOMAIL COORDINATOR:  The REC shall be
     elected as follows:

          a) upon  resignation or  replacement of an existing REC, the
          ZEC shall call an election within that region.

          b) 10  days after the candidates have come forward  an  election
          shall be  held. The REC will be elected by a simple majority
          of the  RC, NCs  and NECs  in  their  FidoNet  Region.    An
          individual holding  more than one position may only cast one
          vote.

     4.   NET ECHOMAIL COORDINATOR:  The NEC shall be appointed by the
     FIDONEWS 13-36               Page 31                   2 Sep 1996


     FidoNet Net  Coordinator (NC)  or in  such alternative  manner as
     determined by  the NC.  If a NEC is not appointed within 30 days,
     the REC will appoint the NEC.

     5.   REMOVAL OF  A *EC:  A *EC may be removed from their position
     by  a  simple  majority  of  those  allowed  to  vote  for  their
     successor.   For a NEC, the members of the Net may vote by simple
     majority to  remove the NEC.  The position directly above (in the
     *EC structure)  will oversee  the recall  election  in  the  same
     manner as prescribed for electing successors.

     A *EC may only be subject to recall for failure to properly carry
     out their  duties described  above, or  if they  are no  longer a
     member of  Fidonet.   A promise  of 'free' echomail delivery from
     another source  is *not*  considered  an  acceptable  reason  for
     recall.

     6.   RECOGNITION OF  CONFERENCES:  The *EC corresponding  to  the
     appropriate level recognizes a conference at his level.  Examples:
     The NEC recognizes a conference as local.  The REC  recognizes  a
     conference to be regional.   A ZEC recognizes a conference to  be
     zonal.  The IC recognizes a conference to be inter-zonal.

     7.   REMOVAL OF  AN ECHOMAIL  CONFERENCE MODERATOR:   An Echomail
     Conference Moderator  may be  removed from  their position  by  a
     three fourths  (3/4) vote of the *EC structure voting.  This vote
     must be  carried out  in a fair and decent manner while giving at
     least ten  (10) days  notice to  the entire  *EC structure of the
     forthcoming vote.   Notice  mediums acceptable are: Netmail from the
     ZEC, usage  of international  postings  in  such  conferences  as
     COORD.     Or  in  extreme  instances,  by  REC  to  NEC  written
     notification.

     An Echomail  Conference Moderator  may only  be subject to recall
     for failure to properly carry out their duties described above or
     continued pre-meditated  violation of  this documents  section V.
     Statement of  Policies as  seen below.   Failing  to perform  the
     above duties of a conference moderator for a period of 3 or more
     months and/or  failing to  designate a proxy in his absence shall
     be in  violation of this policy and be subject to recall.  A vote
     may only be callable by the REC (or his delegate).  This delegate
     should not  be from  the net of the affected conference moderator.

     Membership in  Fidonet need  not be  a paramount  issue,  but  is
     highly recommended.



     V.  STATEMENT OF POLICIES

     1.   BASIC ECHOMAIL  POLICY:   The basic policy of Echomail is to
     promote  communication  in  Echomail  Conferences  in  a  lawful,
     friendly  manner   consistent  with  the  general  principles  of
     FidoNet.

     2.   PROHIBITION ON ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES:  Any Node which knowingly
     FIDONEWS 13-36               Page 32                   2 Sep 1996


     distributes or allows to be entered into echomail conferences any
     messages  containing   or   promoting   illegal   activities   or
     information shall  be deemed  to have  violated  general  FidoNet
     policy as being excessively annoying.  As used in this paragraph,
     "illegal activities" includes activities which are a violation of
     civil law  as well  as activities  which would result in criminal
     prosecution.

     3.  AUTOMATED CENSORSHIP:  The use of Automated Censorship in the
     passing  or   distribution  of  echomail  will  be  considered  a
     violation of  this policy and will not be tolerated. Disciplinary
     action will  be as referred to in General Fidonet policy as being
     excessively annoying.

     An exception  to this  provision shall  be the  deletion and  not
     censorship of  messages by  any Sysop  which may  lead  to  legal
     action against that Sysop.

     No  echomail   shall  be  modified  in  any  manner  which  could
     potentially cause duplicates.

     4.   INTER-NETWORK  CONFERENCES:    Inter-Net  conferences  shall
     conform to  general Fidonet  policy as  well as the provisions of
     this  policy  document  in  addition  to  any  foreign  network's
     provisions.

     5.   CHARGING FOR  DISTRIBUTION:  Any entity which makes a profit
     from the distribution (passing from system to system) of echomail
     shall be  deemed to  be excessively  annoying and in violation of
     Fidonet policy  subject to  enforcement  under  existing  Fidonet
     policy.   Profit as defined in this paragraph is the charging for
     echomail distribution  that exceeds  actual cost  to  obtain  and
     distribute the Echomail over a sustained period.  The cost of the
     equipment used  to obtain  and distribute  echomail  may  not  be
     recovered.   A Sysop  that charges  users for access to their BBS
     shall NOT be in violation of this paragraph.

     6.   RESTRICTED DISTRIBUTION  CONFERENCES:   Participating  Nodes
     shall honor  and support  the restrictions placed upon restricted
     distribution conferences.    Violation  of  this  restriction  by
     individual nodes and points shall be a violation of this echomail
     policy  and   result  in  suspension  of  the  violated  echo  in
     accordance with  the above paragraph in Section III Duties of the
     Echomail Conference Moderators.

     A SYSOP  only conference  shall be  made available  only  to  the
     Sysops or Co-Sysops of Fidonet or other nets with which inter-net
     conferences exist.

     A  violation   of  the   restrictions  placed   on  a  RESTRICTED
     DISTRIBUTION CONFERENCE will be a violation of this policy if and
     only if  the moderator  has posted and specified the restrictions
     governing the conference.

     7.   PATH REQUIRED:   The PATHline, originally implemented by SEA
     in the  MGM package,  is required except for terminal nodes.   If
     FIDONEWS 13-36               Page 33                   2 Sep 1996


     your current Echomail  scanner supports  the  pathline  you  must
     enable it NOW.  If your current Echomail scanner does not support
     the pathline, and  if  there  is  no  alternative  scanner,  then
     enforcement  of  this paragraph  will  be deferred  for 60  days.
     After that date, the *ECs may refuse to accept/supply echomail to
     any node that is not supporting the pathline.

     8.  SEEN-BY LINE:  Under the current technology and topology (the
     routing structure  of echomail),  SEEN-BY lines play an important
     part in  reducing duplicate  messages.  Tiny SEEN-BYs will not be
     allowed until  the respective ZECs feel topology will allow their
     use.   Nor will  the stripping of SEEN-BYs (except Zone-Gates and
     Inter-Network EchoGates) be allowed unless approved by the ZEC.

     Violation of  the above  shall be  excessively annoying  behavior
     enforceable under  general Fidonet policy.  Zone-Gates and Inter-
     Network EchoGates SHOULD strip the SEEN-BYs of the exporting Zone
     or Network to reduce addressing conflicts.

     9.   COUNTERFEIT MESSAGES:   Entering  or knowingly  distributing
     counterfeit messages shall be considered excessively annoying and
     a violation  of Fidonet  policy enforceable  under the  terms  of
     Fidonet policy.  As used in this paragraph, a counterfeit message
     is defined  as any  message entered  using another person's name,
     handle or  node address with the intent of deceiving others about
     the true  author of  the message.   No  handles shall  be used to
     enter  messages   to  knowingly   provoke,  inflame,   or   upset
     participants in a conference with the purpose of deceiving others
     about the true identity of the author.

     10.   SYSOP'S RESPONSIBILITY:   It  is the responsibility of each
     Sysop to make every reasonable effort to assure that the users on
     his board  conform to  the provisions of this policy document.  A
     Sysop may  be held  responsible for  the acts of his users unless
     the Sysop  can show that a reasonable attempt was made to conform
     to this policy document.

     11.   ECHOMAIL SOFTWARE:   EchoMail  exchanges may consist of any
     type of  archival storage  format agreed  upon by  both  parties.
     SEA's ARC 5.1 (non-Squashing) archival storage format will be the
     "fallback" if  either party  is unable or unwilling to support an
     alternate method.  The continued use of Echomail software without
     prior agreement  of both  the sending  and receiving  nodes which
     interferes with  the  distribution  of  echomail  shall  lead  to
     disciplinary action  as described  previously in  this  document.
     See Section  III.   Examples of prohibited software would include
     the use  of  non-standard  echomail  packets  which  can  not  be
     processed by  the receiving  system. Another example would be the
     use  of   poorly  implemented  scanners  or  tossers  that  cause
     duplicates or  fail to  forward messages  to downstream links.  A
     further example  is the use of Tiny seenby options and the use of
     ^A hidden SEEN-BY lines.  Use of Echomail software which does not
     conform to  the minimum  acceptable standards  as defined  by the
     Fidonet  Technical  Standards  Committee  (FTSC)  shall  lead  to
     disciplinary action  as described  previously in  this  document.
     The Software Certification Committee is authorized  to  determine
     FIDONEWS 13-36               Page 34                   2 Sep 1996


     whether software meets minimum standards for use on the net.

     12.   HOST ROUTING OF ECHOMAIL:  Host routing of Echomail without
     the prior  consent of  both the Sending and Receiving Hosts shall
     lead to  disciplinary action  as  described  previously  in  this
     document.  See Section III.

     13.   SENDING OF ECHOMAIL DURING ZONE MAIL HOUR:  Transmission of
     echomail during  Zone Mail  Hour as  defined  in  Fidonet  policy
     without the  consent  of  the  receiving  system  shall  lead  to
     disciplinary action  as described  previously in  this  document.
     See Section III.

     14.   INTER-NETWORK CONFERENCES:   It  is the  general policy  of
     Fidonet   to   encourage   the   development   of   INTER-NETWORK
     CONFERENCES.   It shall be the duty of those providing the INTER-
     NETWORK CONFERENCE  links  to  remove  foreign  net  distribution
     identifiers which  will adversely  effect the distribution of the
     Echomail  Conference   while  in   Fidonet.    The  INTER-NETWORK
     CONFERENCE links  maintained in  Fidonet shall  be operated  in a
     manner not  to interfere  with the foreign network's distribution
     of Echomail.

     15.   DEFAMATORY POSTING:   The posting of any DEFAMATORY MESSAGE
     other than in conferences dedicated to this purpose (i.e. FLAME)
     shall lead to disciplinary action as described previously in this
     document.   See Section III.   The posting of substantiated facts
     shall not be considered a violation under this section.

     16.   ADDING OR  REMOVING  CONFERENCES  FROM  THE  Backbone:    A
     conference may  be added  to the  Backbone only by request of the
     RECOGNIZED Conference  Moderator.   A conference  may be  removed
     from the Backbone by lack of traffic. the REC shall review the status
     of backbone echoes every 3 months.    At  which time those echoes
     which have not maintained a minimum 10  messages a  week over the
     preceding 3 months will be noted and  their Conference  moderators
     will be contacted.  These conferences will  be given  3 months  to
     improve their traffic or withdraw from  Fidonet backbone
     distribution.    The  recognized conference moderator may request
     removal of their conference from the Fidonet backbone distribution at
     their discretion.

     17.   TOPOLOGY and  DUPLICATE MESSAGES:    Cross  Regional  links
     should be  avoided as  they increase the risk of improper linking
     and generation  of duplicate  messages.  Cross Regional links may
     be established  only with  the permission  of  the  REC  in  each
     region.  Each REC will do their best to make available high speed
     hubs, out  of country hubs, PC Pursuit hubs, etc, to facilitate the
     low cost,  efficient movement  of mail  within  their  respective
     Region.  If either REC has reason to believe duplicates are being
     introduced into  the system, an existing Cross Regional link must
     be immediately cut pending resolution.

     Any Sysop  who willfully  and knowingly  establishes  links  that
     either create  duplicate loops  (topology that  creates  circular
     feeds), increase  the risk  of such loops or who refuses to break
     FIDONEWS 13-36               Page 35                   2 Sep 1996


     those links  upon request  by their  NEC, REC  or  ZEC  shall  be
     subject to  disciplinary action  as described  previously in this
     document.  See Section III.

     18.   MESSAGE STANDARDS:   Until  the adoption  of a  superseding
     standard  by  the  Fidonet  Technical  Standards  Committee,  the
     following Echomail message standards will apply:

          a)   Eight-bit characters  (ASCII 128-255)  and non-printing
          low-order codes (ASCII 2-31) are discouraged, and are at
          the sole discretion of the relevant conference moderator.
          except the use of 8Dh(soft  <CR> character)  per FTS-0004.
          This  is  not intended to  discourage participation  of foreign
          zones  or networks, which  may permit  said characters.   Any
          echomail processor  should   pass  information   exactly  as  it
          was received, without stripping any non-standard characters.

          b)   Origin lines are limited to 79 characters including the
          required  ending   of  a   proper  network   address   (i.e.
          Zone:Net/Node.Point with zone and point being optional).

          c)   Tear lines  are limited  to 35 characters including the
          required "---  " lead-in.   These may ONLY contain packer or
          editor program  identification.    Tear  lines  for  message
          editors are  discouraged.  If an editor adds a tear line, it
          should also add an origin line to avoid multiple tear lines.

          d)  "Extra"   origin  lines   (ZoneGating)  are  limited  to
          essential information  only.   This consists of the required
          lead-in plus  the network  name "Gateway" and optionally the
          software ID  followed by  a Zone:Net/Node address.
          Example:  " * Origin: FidoNet Gateway (TComm 88:372/666)"

          e)   SEEN-BY addresses  must be  in sorted  order.  Multiple
          AKAs are  not allowed in SEEN-BY lines unless you have more
          than one  address which  processes mail.  Or for  one  month
          during change of an existing address (to avoid duplicates to
          the previous  address).  Node 0 addresses should not be used
          for echomail distribution.

          f)  All current FTSC specifications should be followed.


     VI.  ENFORCEMENT

     Enforcement of this policy document shall be under the provisions
     of  General  FidoNet  policy.    Complaints  concerning  Echomail
     violations  defined  under  this  policy  may  be  filed  by  the
     aggrieved individual, the conference moderator or by any level of
     Echomail Coordinator.   All  complaints  made  pursuant  to  this
     policy must  be made  within 60 days of the date of occurrence or
     discovery.   Complaints shall  be filed  under the  provisions of
     Fidonet Policy, with a copy to the respective *EC.

     Enforcement is  immediate, with  any currently  existing software
     allowed 60  days to  conform (from  the date  EchoPol2 goes  into
     FIDONEWS 13-36               Page 36                   2 Sep 1996


     effect).   A 30-day  extension  may  be  granted  solely  at  the
     discretion of  the ZEC  if efforts  to bring about compliance are
     clear.   Continued use  of aberrant  software after  this  period
     shall be deemed excessively annoying.


     VII.  ADOPTION OF POLICY

     1.     ADOPTION:     This  policy  shall  become  effective  upon
     ratification by  a  simple  majority  of  those  voting.    Those
     eligible to  vote shall be the RECs.  The RECs must solicit the
     opinions of their regions before voting.

     2.   GRANDFATHER CLAUSE:   Within  60 days  of adoption  of  this
     policy, moderators  shall be  appointed for all existing Echomail
     Conferences which  do not now have a moderator.  Moderators shall
     be appointed  by the  REC of the relevant region from those
     volunteering as moderator or if no  volunteer is  available then  the
     REC  shall  request  and appoint a  moderator for  the conference.  In
     the case where more than one  individual claims to be the conference
     moderator and no agreement can  be reached,  the  REC  may  order  the
     conference retired and  ban the further use of the specific conference
     name.  Failure of the individuals to retire the conference name shall
     be deemed excessively annoying behavior.


     VI.  BACKBONE STRUCTURE

     This section  is for information purposes only.  It gives a plain
     English description of the current structure and operation of the
     Backbone.   The REC  may change  this structure  without amending
     this document.

     At the  top of  the  Echomail  distribution  network,  there  are
     systems  commonly  called  Stars.    These  systems  are  usually
     dedicated  to  passing  Echomail.    The  stars  operate  at  the
     discretion and direction of the REC.  In  general, the  Stars link to
     one another and feed the RECs.

     The RECs  are then  responsible for  distribution of the echomail
     within their  Region.   Normally, the  REC will  feed the NECs in
     that region.

     The NEC  is responsible  for  information about distribution  of
     Echomail  to  the individual Sysops within a net.

     Note that  the RECs  and NECs  can appoint  Hubs to  help in  the
     distribution of  Echomail.  That is, they do not have to directly
     feed the lower level.


     This Document is designed as a stop-gap between the old EP1, and a
     new Echopol document for this Zone, changes have been made at this
     time only to reflect the differences between what was intended solely
     for use within Zone One, and what is needed for Zone Two
     This document is a temporary one, and may be modified either wholly or
     FIDONEWS 13-36               Page 37                   2 Sep 1996


     in full by a vote among this regions RECs, after they have consulted
     with their Regions.  The voting on replacement either in part or in
     full will be called by the ZEC/2.  if more than 75% of the Zones RECs
     decide that it needs replacing in full or in part, then the ZEC/2 must
     attend to this matter as a priority.

     Note1:

     The appeal chain is always from the "bottom" upwards, IE if a
     Node feels that his access to a conference has been unfairly
     denied, he may appeal to his NEC, if this appeal is unsuccessful,
     and the node still thinks the decision is unfair, then they may
     step up to the REC for an appeal.  If the node is still unhappy with
     this decision, then they may appeal to the ZEC/2 whose decision will
     be FINAL.  During this appeal period, the Nodes conference access will
     remain cut.  The same applies if a sysop has any other complaints
     regarding the Moderation of an echo

     Hi Chris...

     you find some old nodelists here (2:240/5815):

     Subj: Something about FidoNews (probably)

     Hi Chris,

     I just spotted a little error in the Fidonews masthead:

      >        FNEWSD34.ZIP  FidoNews, Vol. 13, Nr. 31 (August 19, 1996)
      >        FNEWSD35.ZIP  FidoNews, Vol. 13, Nr. 32 (August 26, 1996)
      >         (etc)                               ^^

     FNEWSD35.ZIP is issue 35, isn't it?

     >> Damian <<

     [it sure is! i forgot to update that part when i changed the front
      part [grin]. it's fixed now. thanks!] Ed.

                           QUESTION OF THE WEEK
     =================================================================


     The Zone 1 Backbone produces a complete list of the Echos it carries
     every week. Zone 2 appears to do likewise although receipt of them is
     sporadic at best in Zone 1.

     The Question of the Week is:

     Do the other Zones produce Echolists in their Zones? What are they
     called? Where are they available? How often are they produced? Who
     distributes them and to whom?

     Send answers as .ART, Netmail, email, or in the FIDONEWS Echo.

     Thanks.

     Latest Greatest Software Versions
     by Peter E. Popovich, 1:363/264

     This week was unique: an inbound chock full of completed forms but
     not enough time to process them all. Several required clarification,
     I hope to have them all included for next week. At this point, I'm
     tempted to do my Jewish impression: "Oy vay, if you had the week that
     I had, you'd be impressed there was a column at all!"

     One note: Several authors have sent in internet style addresses for
     inclusion in the list. I'm not about to flame anyone; but I should
     probably explain my mindset:

     It is my hope to find a Fidonet contact address and a FREQ name for
     each package. While I'll always try to respect the author's wishes,
     I'd far rather run info on a secondary Fidonet site than run a URL
     for a primary web site. This isn't so much a political view as it is
     an attempt to ensure that nodes who read Fidonews need look no
     further than this list for addresses they're sure to have access to.

     Also, I encourage listing every current version of a package for
     every platform that it has a native binary for. I'm happy to run FD
     2.12 and 2.20c. I'm happy to run Maximus for DOS, OS/2, and Win32.
     But I don't think I can, in good conscience, run an extra entry just
     to list a support contact.

     On the other hand, there are no hard and fast rules. I originally
     planned to reject any entry I couldn't stuff into one line; "Silver
     XPress Reader" and "Joaquim Homrighausen" disabused me of that notion
     quickly... ;-)

     Phased out this week: ADTBBS 1.50.

     Phase-out highlights:
       This week: DMG 2.93 Deadline for info: 12 Sep 1996.
       Last week: Aurora 1.32b. Deadline for info: 6 Sep 1996.
