     The EchoMail areas have become "Special Interest Group"
     mail areas carrying help and information about various
     interests to users around the "world."  The IBM-PCjr is
     just one of those Special Interest Groups.  Here are some
     "bits" taken from that echomail area: Jr-Msg.

     There are about 400,000 PCjrs floating around the United
     States and Canada.  Many said "It'll never make it"..
     "You can't do anything with it",  "It's too expensive to
     Expand".....etc.....  Well, IBM continues to supply parts
     and support for the PCjr.  There are software packages that
     make use of PCjr's superior graphics abilities (comparable
     to EGA).  Those with EGA can now see 16 colors in Hi-Res...
     the PCjr owners have seen them since day one.

     It was noted that the PCjr has a better monitor than the
     regular PC and there have been discussions of how to
     attach the PCjr monitors to PC and XT's.  Possibly even to
     an EGA card.  No facts on the EGA card (yet).

     During 1986-87, several developments occurred that
     keep the Junior in the mainstream of the MS/PC DOS
     world.  These same developments have been discussed
     in the echomail area called Jr-Msg.

     The supposed maximum rate of data transmission for the
     Junior was 4800 bps .. but, a data transmission rate of
     over 10,000 bps using a NULL modem cable was discovered
     by one of the users and posted in Jr-Msg.  Nothing new for
     a PC or XT owner, but supposed to be impossible for a PCjr.

     One company released a 9600 baud Serial Card.  Think we knew
     about that last year.  Telebit and USR, here we come!

     The Jr's single disk drive caused many people to
     ignore it when looking for an inexpensive 8088 based machine.
     But, during the last year a way to attach Bernouli Boxes
     to the Jr made it into an attractive starting point for
     someone wanting to develop a system "a little at a time."
     We already knew that we could put anything up to a 70Mb drive
     on Jr.  Now, how about the optical disk?

     The 4.27 mhz clock speed made the Junior seem like the
     slowest thing around, especially since the memory on the
     motherboard has wait states bringing the Norton speed
     rating to .7 of a normal PC.  However in the last year
     several people have discovered ways of increasing the
     CPU speed.  There are upgrade kits for less than $100
     FidoNews 4-42                Page 2                   16 Nov 1987


     that will take the PCjr to 8 mhz and there are rumors
     around that there are some jrs "out there" running at
     20mhz!  (Some of these were at IBM).

     Software incompatibilities have been a bane to PCjr
     users, especially those who wanted to bring their work
     home.  There have been notes in Jr-Msg (the PCjr echo area)
     on fixes to run DBase III+, MS QuickBasic 3 and Auto-CAD
     on the PCjr.

     I think what we are getting at is The PCjr is alive and well
     in the world of PC's, XT's and AT's (as well as all the clones).
     If you have a PCjr and really WANT to know more about it, what
     you CAN do with it or just what OTHERS have done with it....
     we would like you or your PCjr users to "join" us on Jr-Msg.
     Ask your Regional Echomail Co-Ordinator to "pick-up" Jr-Msg from
     the National Backbone. - OR - Contact Matt Mayer at 115/212
     or Phil Kaiser at 104/904.....and join us "Direct".

     Kilgore Trout, 1:107/6


                          What's Happening at SEA?

     How often have you gone searching for a link to  some  conference
     you've heard of?  Even worse, have you ever painstakingly located
     a  conference  link,  just to find that someone you swap echomail
     with daily had it all along?  Don't you wish there was some  easy
     way to automate all that?  Well, there is!


     MGMlink  was written to locate new conference links over existing
     channels.  It works on the assumption that you'd rather add  some
     more traffic to an existing phone call than to make another call.

     MGMlink  is  essentially  a  query system for a remote data base.
     The data base it queries is that massive, thinly-spread data base
     on  conference  topology  that  is  stored  collectively  in   in
     everyone's AREAS.BBS files.  Here's how it works:

         Let's  say there's some conference called STAMPS dedicated to
         stamp collectors.  You, being an avid philatelist, would like
         to get it.  So you type the command:

              mgmlink stamps

         MGMlink will create a netmail message to everyone you now  do
         echomail with, asking for a path to the STAMPS conference.

         Suppose  one  of  those  people is Gee Wong,  who carries the
         STAMPS  conference.  Every  day  he  invokes  MGMlink  in  an
         external  event.  His  MGMlink  will  automatically  create a
         netmail message to you telling you that he has STAMPS and can
         pass it to you.

         Let's  make  that  example  a  little  tougher.  Suppose  Gee
         doesn't have STAMPS; now what happens?  Well, if Gee has told
         his  MGMlink  that  he's  willing  to  add new conferences if
         people want them, then his MGMlink will create a new query to
         everyone he does echomail with.

         Suppose one  of  those  people  is  Dave  O'Shea,  an  ardent
         philatelist  who  would not be caught dead without his STAMPS
         conference.  His MGMlink will respond to the query by sending
         you a netmail message telling you that he has STAMPS,  and he
         can send it to Gee, who can pass it to you.

     The  harder  case shows the real power of MGMlink.  It can locate
     an indirect link like that through any number of middlemen.  What
     MGMlink  is  actually  doing  is  tracing  backwards through your
     echomail links until it finds a source.


     This starts to sound like an awful lot of MGMlink query  messages
     floating around, but it's not that bad.  Several things limit how
     FidoNews 4-42                Page 4                   16 Nov 1987


     far an MGMlink query can propagate.

     One, of course, is that not everyone is running MGMlink, but this
     could change.

     Another  is that few people will be willing to act as a "backbone
     node" and add new  conferences  just  to  pass  them  through  to
     others.  If  you  tell  MGMlink  that  you  don't want to add new
     conferences,  then any query that reaches  you  will  be  stopped
     cold.

     Another  is  that  MGMlink keeps track of "side chains",  so that
     nobody should ever get more than one copy of  any  given  MGMlink
     query message.

     And  finally you can tell MGMlink to send a query only to certain
     nodes.  Suppose,  for example,  that you get tons  and  tones  of
     echomail  from  three  people,  and  then  pass  it on to a dozen
     others,  with very little going  the  other  way.  You  can  tell
     MGMlink to limit queries to the three "upstream" nodes.


     Who  should  run  MGMlink?  Anyone  who  wants to be a "backbone"
     node,  passing along conferences to help out those  around  them,
     and anyone who is trying to promote a conference should look into
     MGMlink.


     Do  you  need  to  use  MGM  to  use MGMlink?  Of course not.  We
     believe in modular programming.  Every program in the MGM  system
     is  written to do a specific task,  and to be useable as a stand-
     alone utility to accomplish  that  task.  MGMlink  in  particular
     will  work  with  any  popular  PC conferencing system (including
     EchoMail, Confmail, Opus, and even TBBS), because MGMlink queries
     and answers move as normal network mail.

                            Voyager 1's Problems

     And you thought your computer was flakey.  Here is a story  about
     mans  greatest  probe  ever  launched  into space and its flakes.
     This is an actual account  of  Voyager  1  and  the  problems  it
     encountered  December 13'th,  1979.  Written by Fredric L.  Rice,
     August  1985.   Original  reference  material  may  be  found  at

     There is a concept making the rounds describing the  attitude  of
     electronic equipment when it decides to do something out  of  the
     ordinary,  by  itself,  without  being  asked to.  The concept is
     titled "Digi-nerds".  It may include just about anything you care
     to name. It strikes once, leaving much damage.

     The cause of digi-nerds is not known.  Perhaps cosmic rays, which
     bombard us constantly, strike our equipment, mutating a zero into
     a one, or a one into a zero.  The result may never be noticed, or
     it may spell disaster for your bank account.

     When  Voyager  1  completed  its mid-course correction,  December
     13'th, 1979,  it met up with a digi-nerd at 48,000 miles an hour,
     and 619 million miles from home.

     The  course  correction  required  a  37  minute burn to effect a
     change in speed of eleven miles an hour.  During that  time,  the
     radio  dish had to be turned away from its Earth-Line so that the
     engine would be aligned according to its flight plan. The Voyager
     vehicles were designed to carry out  complicated  maneuvers  like
     this without requiring any instructions from Earth.

     All went according to plan; Saturn had been treated to a rare and
     beautiful  sight of a new star tracking through its distant skys.
     After the main burn,  an inhabitant of Saturn,  (if he had had  a
     good  telescope),  might  have  seen  some  additional flashes as
     Voyager attempted to realign itself to its Earth-Line  using  its
     attitude control thrusters.

     Voyager  1  regains its Earth orientation by locating the Sun and
     the star Canopus.  When the Sun tracker is locked onto  the  Sun,
     and  the  star tracker is locked onto Canopus,  the radio disk is
     aligned exactly at Earth.  When contact was not restored at  3:13
     p.m.  P.S.T. on December 13, it was known that something had gone
     wrong.

     To find the Sun,  the vehicle rotates itself a few degrees  at  a
     FidoNews 4-42                Page 6                   16 Nov 1987


     time  until  the  Sun tracker lockes onto the Sun.  There is only
     one stellar object that can be as bright at the Sun, (even at 711
     million miles the Sun is an impressive sight).  When the  Sun  is
     positivly  identified,  the  vehicle rotates itself along another
     axis until the star tracker locates Canopus.

     The Deep Space Network Antenna located in Madrid  heard  a  faint
     signal  from  Voyager.  This gave the scientist the idea that the
     probe was basicly healthy but somehow simply misaligned.  Even if
     this  be  the  case,  if the device was too badly misaligned,  it
     might not be able to read a command from Earth telling it how  to
     find Earth again.

     Voyager  1 was on the verge of being lost forever.  Adrift in the
     heavens with no possibility of being recovered.  Unable to report
     its posistion and the cause of its ailments.

     Dr.  Jones  and  his Spacecraft Team knew that Alpha Centauri and
     Rigel could deceive the star tracker.  Based on  the  possibility
     that  one  of  these  stars  was  locked  onto,  the  team beamed
     instructions through the Deep Space Network at Madrid to the lost
     spacecraft in the hopes that a  strong  enough  signal  could  be
     read.  Dr. Jones directed the spacecraft to align itself with the
     assumption that it was locked onto Alpha Centauri.

     Voyager 1 did receive the instructions,  and it  did  attempt  to
     realign itself according to its new instructions.  Alpha Centauri
     was the wrong star.  Radio contact was  not  improved  after  the
     spacecraft completed its instructions.

     Next,  Voyager  was  instructed  to  realign  itself  base on the
     assumption it was locked onto Rigel.  This did not improve  radio
     reception, causing much disappointment to the Spacecraft Team.

     Though  they  did not know what star Voyager was locked on,  they
     did know that from its point of view the Sun and  Earth  appeared
     eight  degrees  apart.  If the spacecraft could be made to wobble
     out an eight degree cone, the signal from the spacecraft could be
     made to sweep accross the Earth every  now  and  then,  and  they
     would   be  able  to  learn  more  information  about  where  the
     spacecraft was pointing.

     The maneuver worked.  On December 16'th,  almost complete contact
     was regained through the Canberra,  Australia,  tracking station.
     Total loss of signal time exceeded 71 hours.  In order  to  learn
     why  the  spacecraft  has  gone  astray,  Dr.  Jones and his team
     ordered it to replay all information it had on what had  happened
     for   the   last   three   days.   Records  showed  an  error  in
     communications between two on  board  computers,  and  there  was
     nothing  showing  to  restrict  another  attempt to regain normal
     contact.  The spacecraft was instructed to go through its  Earth-
     Find maneuver December 19'th,  and on December 20'th, Voyager was
     again in full contact with the Earth.

     Reconstruction of the detailed data Voyager offered  showed  that
     the  spacecrafts master computer had ordered a secondary computer
     FidoNews 4-42                Page 7                   16 Nov 1987


     to shut down the engines at the end  of  the  course  correction.
     Commands such as this are requested twice,  and it was the second
     instruction that got  garbled  between  the  two  computers.  The
     first instruction had indeed shut down the engines yet the second
     corrupted   instruction  was  not  understood  by  the  secondary
     computer.  This computer reported the strange instruction to  the
     master computer who declaired an abort.

     When  a  spacecraft abort is executed,  all operations are thrown
     away and the Earth-Find maneuver is executed.  Voyager did  this,
     and in fact did find the Sun.  It was while the spacecraft was on
     its search for Canopus that another emergency was detected.

     The attitude control  system  reported  a  leak  in  the  primary
     thrusters.  Actually, the master computer had requested from 1026
     to 1094 "shots" from the attitude control  thrusters,  while  the
     attitude  control  computer interprets more than 1000 as evidence
     of a leak. It reported a problem and the star search was aborted.

     So there it stood,  with only a minimal contact with  Earth;  its
     star  tracker  not  pointing at any known object.  The spacecraft
     was  compleatly  healthy  but  for  no  known  reason  a  garbled
     transmission  from the master computer to the slave had triggered
     an emergency.

     There had been more than five hundred  thousand  instructions  to
     cross  its  data  bus,  and  it had already executed six previous
     Earth Find maneuvers.

     Sometimes our failures turn out to be our  biggest  triumphs.  To
     defeat  a  problem  which  might end our achievements is a better
     boost to  our  moral  than  the  defeating  of  a  known  hazard,
     (Remember  Apolo  13  and  the  problems  circumvented  by  those
     aboard).

     The space shuttle will no doubt encounter digi-nerds  on  one  of
     its many scheduled flights.  We can only hope it wont be over 600
     million miles away when it does.

        The Griffith Observer is a publication that  everyone  who  is
        interested  in  astronomy should subscribe to.  At the time of
        this articles release into the Public Domain, 12 issues of the
        Griffith Observer were going  for  $5.00.  This  money,  after
        paying for the publication costs, goes towards the "Friends of
        the  Observatory"  fund.  Edwin  C.  Krupp,  who  manages  the
        building,  (who also hosted the series "Project Universe" that
        you  have probibly seen on public television),  uses the money
        to  maintain  the  observatory.   If   you   want   additional
        information, contact Mr.  Krupp by U.  S. Snail, or send Fido-
        Mail to Fredric Rice (200/3),  and I can deliver informational
        requests for you.

                    -- The Regular Irregular Column --

          Well,  this  column  has  finally become a little irregular.
     Unfortunately this hasn't been by design. Between trying out Fido
     version 12  and some  programming projects for local companies, I
     just haven't had the time  to  write  this  long  overdue column.
     Hopefully things  will become somewhat more regular over the next
     few weeks.

          Several weeks ago someone wanted an unbiased opinion on Fido
     12, and in Thom Henderson's reply was a thinly veiled hint to me.
     Thom was aware that I had  picked it  up from  TJ at  FidoCon and
     here is the long overdue review.

     -- Fido version 12 (Fido Software, $150.00) --

          First off,  Fido is  no longer  shareware. Up until FidoCon,
     there were still some questions  on  how  it  was  going  to work
     (software free  but not  the manuals  for example). Everything is
     now purchased from Fido Software. Registered owners of  Fido will
     be given  a discount  on version 12, but it will cost anyone else
     $150.00. That includes the  software and  documentation, you will
     not be  able to download the software from any bulletin boards. I
     am happy to report that the money is well worth it! Fido  12 is a
     definite step  forward for Fido, and at the same time retains the
     flavor of Fido. Some of the most noticeable  improvements are the
     implementation  of  locks  and  keys,  and  ASCII files replacing
     several BBS files and command line switches. In  order to support
     non-IBM  users,  Fido  12  does  not  directly support any of the
     graphics like Opus. The graphics are  still much  the same  as it
     was in 11w, so some of you will be disappointed. I myself support
     TJ in  this, if  for no  other reason  than graphics  slow down a
     system.  I'm  also  more  impressed  with  the content of a board
     rather than how cute it can be made to look.

          One of the first things I noticed is the ease  in setting up
     the message  areas (file  areas are  just as easy). You no longer
     have to keep bringing Fido up in the test mode or use  SYSEDIT to
     add, delete or change a message area. Everything is controlled in
     an ASCII  file called  AREAS.INI. Since  Fido 12  doesn't use the
     SYSTEM??.BBS files  it allows  up to  200 message and file areas.
     EchoMail junkies  should  love  this  feature  as  more  and more
     conferences become  available. Fido  12 will be the only software
     that will allow this many  message  areas.  Also  introduced into
     Fido 12  is the concept of locks and keys. In addition to needing
     a high enough privilege level, you also need  to have  the proper
     key. You  can assign each user his keys through the sysop utility
     and they do not  have  to  relate  to  specific  privilege levels
     (which would  have been  redundant). Their  are 32 keys available
     FidoNews 4-42                Page 10                  16 Nov 1987


     and this should help out immensely with maintaining a board. Keys
     can be  used on  both file  and message areas as well as the menu
     commands. File areas are also set up in  the AREAS.INI  file with
     just as much control.

          All of  the commands are contained in an ASCII file. Because
     of this, you can  change the  command names  (just make  sure you
     keep everything in order). The manual warns against changing them
     for the obvious reason that it makes it  hard on  the users. With
     all the Fido boards out there it would be inconsiderate to change
     any of the commands  without good  reason. Once  again I  have to
     agree with  Fido Software, a standardized command set is an asset
     to the bulletin board community. I've even made  my TBBS commands
     almost identical  to Fido's  (of course there were a few things I
     changed to make things  easier  on  me).  If  you  do  change the
     command names, make sure you change the help files as well (there
     are about half a dozen help files included).  Right now  the only
     good reason I could think of for changing the commands is support
     of foreign languages (I'm  nearly positive  that G)oodbye doesn't
     mean a thing to many FidoNet users scattered throughout Europe!).

          I'm very  supportive of  the locks and keys concept. I first
     "discovered" this idea in the authorization  flags in  TBBS and I
     feel they  can be a great asset to a BBS program. Since locks and
     keys don't affect things  like download  and time  limits, it can
     allow  a  sysop  to  create  different  levels  of access without
     granting them all out. A good  example  of  this  would  be other
     sysops calling  your system.  You might not want to give them any
     more time than a normal caller, but you might want  to allow them
     access to additional message or file areas. Using a lock on these
     new areas, you can  give them  the same  privilege level  as your
     normal users  but only  give the  other sysops the key needed for
     these areas. This makes it easy for one system to  become a local
     center for  sysops in  some of  the large  sysop only conferences
     without  inviting  additional  trouble  from  them  "hogging" the
     bulletin board.

          Bulletins can  often be  a great  asset in  a bulletin board
     program. They can be used for an easy way to give users a list of
     other local bulletin boards (without having to give them download
     privileges), a community bulletin, a list  board policies, giving
     public notice  of those  who have  contributed to a board,or even
     help defray the  boards  operating  expenses  through advertising
     (I've seen  bulletins used  for all  of these  purposes). Fido 12
     makes a big  improvement  over  Fido  11  by  allowing  up  to 99
     bulletins  (as  opposed  to  1  in  Fido  11w).  Instead  of just
     displaying the EDTORIAL.BBS file,  Fido 12  will lists  the first
     non-blank  line  of  each  BULLETIN.n  file  and gives the user a
     chance to choose which  bulletin  he  would  like  to  read. I've
     always viewed  Fido's one  bulletin limit as a serious limitation
     and am very happy to see this go by the wayside.

          Overall, I'm very pleased with how Fido 12 has turned out. I
     was somewhat  afraid that  it would barely resemble the Fido many
     of us have come to know. Fido Software has managed to enhance and
     improve  Fido,  while  keeping  it familiar. Replacing the system
     FidoNews 4-42                Page 11                  16 Nov 1987


     files and command line switches with the ASCII files will  be one
     of the  biggest advantages of Fido 12 (there's a new command that
     will let you override the file path if you want to do some remote
     upkeep). The locks and keys are another nice addition to Fido. TJ
     has made a product that is  easily  worth  the  asking  price. If
     you've been  looking for  an improved  Fido and  Opus just didn't
     seem like the right thing, rest easy and get version 12 from Fido
     Software. I don't think you'll regret the decision.

     -- more on TBBS 2.0(S/M) --

          In  playing  around  with  TBBS, I discovered a command that
     many of you may find appealing. eSoft calls it a combined message
     board  read,  I  call  it  gang  reading.  In all their are three
     commands; a select, a scan, and a read.  Every time  a user calls
     up, TBBS "selects" all the message areas for combined reading and
     scanning. Using the select command, they  can turn  off (and back
     on)  any  of  the  "ganged  areas".  If  they  choose to scan the
     combined areas, they can  mark messages  they want  to read later
     (by telling  the combined  read to  only show  messages that have
     been marked). Some of the different ways to read messages include
     forward,  reverse,  new  messages,  and marked messages. Echomail
     junkies should love this feature as they can  see everything with
     only a  few key  strokes (assuming  they don't  pause, but have a
     capture buffer filling somewhere). I've been using it  myself for
     the past week and it does make it convenient.

          The only  drawback I  can see is that it could allow someone
     access to a message base they normally wouldn't see. The combined
     message base  commands work  off of  the minimum privilege levels
     and   necessary   authorization   flags   you   created   in  the
     configuration editor.  I can  see how  someone might accidentally
     block off a menu with the authorization flags and not worry about
     the message  bases that  could branch  off. If  the flags weren't
     duplicated in the message  area  definition,  it  could  create a
     loophole for  the users.  Of course  this could also be a kind of
     semi-hidden or undocumented part of a board, but  I'd consider it
     bad form.

          The  other  new  feature  I  discovered  is  in  the  pseudo
     directory files. Pseudo-directories are  lists of  files that can
     be downloaded.  One of  the first advantages I discovered is that
     you can define where a file is, and how it should be listed. This
     has allowed  me to put ARC at the top of every file area with the
     message "You will need this  program  to  use  any  of  the files
     listed below" without having to have duplicate copies of ARC. You
     can easily  have the  same file  listed several  times (and under
     different  "names"  to  your  users) in different areas. It could
     also be used to create a master download command on  any menu. If
     you copied  all of your pseudo-directories into one large pseudo-
     directory, someone could download  any program  without having to
     remember which  file area  they should  be in. This way you'd get
     the benefits of having organized file  areas, but  still allowing
     someone to  download any  file without having to worry if they're
     in the correct file  area. For  awhile this  seemed to  mean some
     extra work,  until I  discovered a  real gem  in how TBBS manages
     FidoNews 4-42                Page 12                  16 Nov 1987


     pseudo-directories. It seems that they are  self-cleaning. If you
     delete a file on the hard drive, when TBBS next lists the pseudo-
     directory it will remove  any filenames  and descriptions  if the
     file does  not exist.  No more checking to see what lines have to
     be deleted, it's all done for  you. I'm  still discovering things
     about TBBS,  and so  far it  has only enhanced my appreciation of
     it. I'm  even more  convinced that  it's the  only way  to go for
     multi-line operation.

     -- Winding down... --

          Sierra On-Line  recently released  an new  arcade style game
     they imported from Japan. When I made one of my regular visits to
     a local  computer store,  I was  able to  see a demo of the game.
     Needless to say, I  left the  store with  a brand  new game. It's
     called  Thexder   (Sierra  On-Line,   $34.95)  and  can  be  very
     addicting. It works with any  color  graphics  card,  but doesn't
     really shine unless you have an EGA adapter. Under EGA the colors
     are phenomenal, yet it runs well on any speed machine. The object
     is  to  get  through  16  different  levels.  Each  level  has no
     resemblance to any of the other levels (at  least up  through the
     first  four  levels)  and  you  have  to use unique strategies to
     successfully complete each  level.  You  refuel  by  completing a
     level  without  using  your  shields  and  by  destroying certain
     denizens of the place. Knowing when to run  and when  to shoot is
     almost  half  the  battle  (the  other  half  is  knowing what to
     ignore). If you have a joystick Thexder will let you  use it, but
     I'd advise sticking to the keyboard. My only complaint is that it
     doesn't support Hercules monochrome (thankfully I've  got the EGA
     Wonder  to  take  care  of  things  for me). Arcade game fanatics
     should get many days  of enjoyment  out of  it. Next  time around
     I've got  another of  Sierra's new  programs that's a little more
     text/adventure based.

          As always I would like to  hear your  reactions and comments
     on my  column. If  there's something  you think  I've missed in a
     review or something you believe I should look into just drop me a
     line. I  try to  answer all  of the mail that I receive, although
     sometime it may take awhile. Below  you'll find  my home, Usenet,
     and  FidoNet  addresses.  If  you're sending me a message through
     FidoNet, please mention to  your sysop  that mail  to me  must be
     routed through 157/1 since I'm a private node.
