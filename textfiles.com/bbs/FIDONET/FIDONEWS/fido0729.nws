                      HOW BIG IS THE NETWORK?

     From time to time, some of us (far be it from me to suggest that
     there may have been a brewski or two in the room, or that the
     room was full of net 285 sysops) have wondered how big the
     network really is.  After all, my knowledge is the space the
     NODELIST takes up on my disk, and we all /know/ that it's full
     of duplicates because of coordinators and hubs and zones and
     such.  Right?

     As part of a class I'm taking in Mass Media Law, I had occasion
     to wonder a little more critically.  The only published figures
     were several years old, and mentioned the 3,000 - 4,000 range.
     So I decided to do a little checking.

     My method was to import the nodelist into a database and check
     for duplicate telephone numbers.  There were 1525 duplicates,
     base on NODELIST.194.  Of these, 345 were annotated "duplicate"
     because the telephone number is "-Unpublished-".

     So, not being wanton or frivolous enough to hand check 345
     telephone numbers, I'm assuming that coordinators, regions and
     such aren't likely to have the number -Unpublished-.  So, I
     added back in the -Unpublished count.  The final figure, of
     presumably physically independent nodes, is

                        8739 entries
                   less 1525 duplicates
                   plus  345 -Unpublished-
                   =======================
                        7559 nodes

     and that's the way it is, as of NODELIST.194.  Trivial Pursuit
     fans please take note, everyone else (including yours truly)
     just try to figure out why I bothered!

     Erik VanRiper
     Fido 1:260/230

              The Programmers Distribution Network (PDN) is here!
     After being forced to log on to BBS's all over the world to find
     the latest CXL library, (mostly because I cannot afford C$erve
     or the phone bill!) or a Library for Fossil Routines, I would
     think to myself: "Why is there no means for transferring these
     kinds of files like there is for the SDS?".  Well, I finally
     decided to do something about it.

             On Monday, July 9th, I did a mass mailing to all the
     nodes in Zone 1 with a USDS flag in the nodelist.  Some I could
     not get through to, for unknown reasons, but for the 100 or so I
     did get through to, I received an overwhelming response within 12
     hours.  I also found a few Nets doing this same idea more locally
     and they have agreed to join forces.  A lot of people came up
     with many ideas on how things should be distributed, and I have
     taken them all into consideration.  I figured that the best way
     to handle the distribution would be to set up one node in each
     Region, then have that coordinator pass the files to their own
     Region, and off to one other Region.  We would (of course) use
     TICK, because it works!

           Things will be set up in the following fashion:

           Area Name        Area Description
           =========        ================

           CEE              Any MSDOS related C or C++ files
           PASCAL           Any MSDOS related Pascal files
           BASIC            Any MSDOS related Basic files
           ASSEMBLY         Any 80xxx related Assembly files
           BATCH            Any .BAT related files
           PDNOS2           Any OS/2 related files
           PDNOTHER         Any Amiga, Macintosh, etc. related files
           LANGUAGE         Any Other files that do not fit under the
                            other areas (Unix, Modula-2, Cobol, etc).


            In the above chart, I refer to "files" as Libraries,
     Object code, or Source code in each area.  I would also ask that
     the author (or authorized agent) please make sure that the file
     being entered into the PDN be documented, and functional.  I
     would like to not see "CrippleWare" or "VaporWare" included.
     Only Public Domain and ShareWare should be submitted.

            The following Nodes have volunteered to be Regional
     Distribution points for the PDN:

            * Note 1:  A Gateway between Zone 1 to Zones 2 and 3 has
                       been arranged via Mark Howard (260/0).

            * Note 2:  116/36 has provided gateways to the following
                       Zones: 6, 8, 29, 99, and GTNet.

            If you are in a different Zone, or if you would like more
     information on the PDN, please contact one of the above PDN_RC's,
     and File Request PDNINFO.ZIP.


            If you are interested in distributing the PDN for your
     Net, please contact one of the above PDNRC's to pick up the
     area(s) your Net wants.

            There will also be two message Echo areas created, and
     they will be passed during the distribution of the files.  One
     will be for the PDNRC's to coordinate the transfers, and the
     second will be used by the users of individual BBS's to enable a
     conference for support.

            Happy Programming! :-}

                           Remote Control and You

     "What? That database isn't working? Can you tell me what error
     message you're seeing?....happens too fast eh?...hmmm...Sounds
     like I'll need to hop the next red-eye to Los Angeles. That's ok,
     this Connecticut weather is bumming me out anyway. Hope the boss
     signs that travel voucher. This could get expensive..."

     Remote control. It's a pretty simple concept actually. One device
     being controlled by another device without any true physical
     contact between the devices. We use it everyday with our cable,
     TV, and stereo systems. I personally am the proud owner of 8
     "clickers"! When applied to the PC's on our desks at both home
     and work, it is the same concept.

     Using the example above, remote control can save the techie some
     considerable time and money. The administrator in LA needs only
     to run a "host" program and then sit back while the techie modems
     in from Danbury with the "guest" program, diagnoses the problem
     with the database and even fix it while connected. Everything
     that the techie is doing is being done on the PC in LA yet it is
     being controlled remotely from Danbury. Pretty neat eh?

     The possibilities are almost endless! A good true life example
     exists in Utah. At the bottom of a lake, a PC is sealed in a box
     with phone and power cables routed from the shore. This PC has
     equipment and software that monitors water temprature and flow
     and controls flood gates for a dam nearby. Attached to the PC is
     a modem. The person in charge of this system (whose office is
     about 50 miles away), can see exactly what is happening and can
     make emergency adjustments at any time simply by calling this PC
     and remotely controlling it. No trip to the lake has to be made.

     At the software level, all that is being done is redirection. The
     video output from LA is being sent and maybe translated to the
     video display of the Danbury machine. The keyboard input from
     Danbury is being sent to and processed by the machine in LA. Some
     remote control programs even re-direct printer output. Most
     remote control programs provide file transfer as well.

     Now, you are probably asking me why I'm writing this. I have
     recently created an echo conference that deals with this topic -
     remote control. I know that MANY people do use it. I know that
     MANY people don't. I know that MANY people don't understand it.
     The goal of this conference, called REMOTE, is to educate those
     that don't understand and assist those that use remote control
     software. REMOTE's sideline goals are to induce new ideas for the
     market, discuss problems with current or previous attempts at
     remote control, and keep the user aware of this little niche of
     the software industry.

     As moderator/creator of REMOTE, I can only hope that people
     realize that a forum of this type could really benefit both the
     user and sysop of any bbs system in Fidonet. Remote control
     software is BIG. Each commercially available package is selling
     in the millions while there is a growing presence of remote
     control shareware and public domain software. A node that carries
     this conference could use it as a selling point to attract users!

     REMOTE is currently available from my system, theWeb! 1:141/735,
     along with a majority of the HUBS of Net 1:141 in Connecticut.
     With a bit of luck and lot's of usage, REMOTE could even become a
     backbone echo!
