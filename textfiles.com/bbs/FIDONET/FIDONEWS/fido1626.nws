                                He's Baaaack!

     Henk's back in town.  I got email Saturday... his heart's still in
     Europe but his rear end is in South Africa.  This will be my last
     issue as Editor Pro Tem; next week Fidonews will be in the capable
     hands of Henk Wolsink once again.

     It's been fun.  I'd like to thank the folks who took advantage of
     the Editor Pro Tem Special to send me articles for Fidonews... where
     the heck were you all this week? :)  And thanks for the suggestions
     and criticisms - it's nice to know folks out there actually read the
     Snooze!

     Thanks to Jim Barchuk for turning fidonews.org upside down so that I
     could do the Snooze from the heart of Pennsylvania.  Thanks to Gary
     Rux and George Peace for modifying their TIC configuration so I
     could send instead of receive the FIDONEWS file area.  And a special
     thanks to Henk for letting me roll my sleeves up and work with the
     newsletter of the Fidonet Community in his absence.  Keep me in
     mind, Henk, if you need a stand in again.

                  Z1C Election moves to Regional Discussions
                           Douglas Myers, 1:270/720

     As of Sunday, June 27th (yesterday), the Z1C election moved from
     it's zonewide public input phase to a regional discussion phase.  At
     this point, at least in theory, sysops have had sufficient time to
     evaluate the candidates based on their discussions in Z1_ELECTION
     and now have one week to inform their Regional Coordinator of their
     choice.  All Regional Coordinators, to the best of my knowledge,
     have pledged to vote for the candidate the sysops in their region
     selects rather than a personal choice.  Most regions plan to gather
     input from Net Coordinators.

     As a concerned sysop, this is the most critical phase of the
     election for you - this next week is your only chance to make your
     choice count.  You should monitor your local net's sysop echo to see
     if your NC is gathering input - if not, netmail him or her with your
     choice.  Monitor your region's sysop echo to see if your Regional
     Coordinator is gathering input there.  If so, speak up... even if
     you've already spoken with your net.

     It's imperative that you speak up this week, as next week, July 3rd,
     the election will move to the Regional Coordinator's private echo
     for voting.  Though Ross Cassell will be reporting on this vote, it
     will be too late to influence it.

     There's much more than the identity of the next Zone 1 Coordinator
     at stake here.  This will be a test of sysop involvement in Zone 1
     politics.  Many feel that sysops throughout the zone just don't care
     about the coordinators who represent them.  There is, in my opinion,
     the prospect that a poor turnout in this election will influence
     coordinators to conduct future sessions entirely behind closed
     doors, as has been done in the past.

     This election has busted one myth already:  the feeling that any
     sysop level input into the election process would drag the election
     into senseless and unproductive bickering.  However, the public
     discussion period was mostly orderly, with sysops asking reasonable
     and poignant questions, and candidates very responsive.  Follow
     through by sysops in the next week should lay to rest the myth of
     sysop apathy in Fidonet.

     =================================================================


          The Top 15 Unforeseen Consequences of the "Millennium Bug"

     15. IRS demands a hundred years of interest from stunned taxpayers.

     14. "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall" song gets stuck in infinite
         loop.

     13. At the stroke of midnight, Windows 99 turns back into DOS 1.0,
         the Pentium V turns back into an 8088, and the Handsome User is
         left holding a beautiful glass mouse.

     12. Internet Movie Database now lists "1901: A Space Odyssey"

     11. Residents of Indiana have to figure out if they're off by 999
         years, 364  days and 23 hours, or 1000 years and one hour.

     10. Bob Dole's age erroneously listed with only 2 digits.

     9.  Mel Brooks's "2000 year old man" skit stops being funny....
         oops, too late!

     8.  Sales of Coca Cola jumps drastically after original
         cocaine-laden formula becomes legal again.

     7.  Software engineers point out that since computers think it's
         almost 1900, we technically have to "party like it's 1899,"
         which, frankly, doesn't seem like much fun.

     6.  Microsoft declares the year 1900 to be the new standard of the
         "Gatesian" calendar.

     5.  Jesus shows up late for His second coming, blames it on COBOL
         programmers.

     4.  Computers temporarily fooled into thinking Strom Thurmond is
         only 103.

     3,  First Top 5 List of the year? "Reasons No One Would Ever
         Assassinate President McKinley"

     2.  Using a computerized adoption service, Michael Jackson
         mistakenly takes home some octogenarians.

     and the Number 1 Unforeseen Consequence of the "Millennium Bug"...

     1.  Unexpected demand for COBOL programmers results in severe
         understaffing of fast-food restaurants.
