     Your editor has been following the P4 discussions and learning what
     many think on the subject. Some want to dump it, some want to ignore
     it, some want to `work around it', and believe it or not some want to
     work to modify it only in a couple of places to make it democratic in
     nature.  I've taken the liberty to take excerpts of some messages in
     open echoes, to develop an understanding for the global reader that
     may not have access to these echoes.

     With that foundation for this editoral in mind, and the knowledge that
     the Policy known as P4, being a bone of contention in many Regions
     since it was presented to replace Policy 1.0; plus (I am informed) was
     never ratified by the sysops as was Policy 1.0. That coupled with
     the necessity of all Zones to approve any ammendments has made it a
     catch 22 that is the quagmire, bone of contention, etc. that plagues
     Fidonet and perpetuates it's nick name,"Fight-O-net".

     It's called being honourable, Stewart. It's the same issue as obeying
     speed limits at 2 AM when you know there are no cops around. Either
     you live an ethical and honourable life or you don't.

     Policy 4 is the policy that FidoNet uses. There is much of it I don't
     like, but until it's changed I will follow it. To do otherwise is to
     have anarchy, and while that was very enjoyable in the early days of
     FidoNet it rapidly became obvious that we couldn't continue in that
     pattern once we got beyond a few dozen members.

     Hello everybody.

     NOTICE OF REVOCATION OF INDEPENDENCE
     To the citizens of the United States of America,
     In the light of your failure to elect a President of
     the USA and thus to govern yourselves, we
     hereby give notice of the revocation of your
     independence, effective today. Her Sovereign
     FIDONEWS 17-48               Page 2                   20 Nov 2000


     Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchial
     duties over all states, commonwealths and other
     territories. Except Utah, which she does not fancy.
     Your new prime minister (The rt. hon. Tony Blair,
     MP for the 97.85% of you who have until now been
     unaware that there is a world outside your borders)
     will appoint a minister for America without the need
     for further elections. Congress and the Senate will
     be disbanded. A questionnaire will be circulated
     next year to determine whether any of you noticed.
     To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency,
     the following rules are introduced with immediate effect:

     1. You should look up "revocation" in the Oxford
     English Dictionary. Then look up "aluminium".
     Check the pronunciation guide. You will be amazed
     at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it.
     Generally, you should raise your vocabulary to
     acceptable levels. Look up "vocabulary". Using
     the same twenty seven words interspersed with
     filler noises such as "like" and "you know" is an
     unacceptable and inefficient form of communication.
     Look up "interspersed".

     2. There is no such thing as "US English". We will
     let Microsoft know on your behalf.

     3. You should learn to distinguish the English and
     Australian accents. It really isn't that hard.

     4. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast
     English actors as the good guys. Although it comes
     as a bit of a shock, the USA did not pilot the "Battle of
     Britain" spitfires during the war against Germany.
     Likewise, Rommel was defeated by the British &
     Australian Armies in Africa,.... not Sylvester Stallone
     & Bruce Willis. Probably your biggest shock will be
     the fact that the US didn't enter World War 2 until
     halfway through the war when the Germans mistakenly
     sank a few US ships. By then the war was decided by
     the Commonwealth countries troops ..... and your
     guys just helped to speed the end up.

     5. You should relearn your original national anthem,
     "God Save The Queen", but only after fully carrying
     out task 1. We would not want you to get confused
     and give up half way through.

     6. You should stop playing American "football".
     There is only one kind of football. What you refer
     to as American "football" is not a very good game.
     The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a
     world outside your border may have noticed that
     no one else plays "American" football. You will no
     longer be allowed to play it, and should instead
     play proper football. Initially, it would be best if you
     FIDONEWS 17-48               Page 3                   20 Nov 2000


     played with the girls. It is a difficult game. Those of
     you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to play
     rugby (which is similar to American "football", but
     does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty
     seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like
     nancies). We are hoping to get together at least
     a US rugby sevens side by 2005.

     7. You should declare war on Quebec and France,
     using nuclear weapons if they give you any merde.
     The 98.85% of you who were not aware that there is
     a world outside your borders should count yourselves
     lucky. The Russians have never been the bad guys.
     "Merde" is French for "sh*t".

     8. July 4th is no longer a public holiday. November 8th
     will be a new national holiday, but only in England.
     It will be called "Indecisive Day".

     9. All American cars are hereby banned. They are crap
     and it is for your own good. When we show you German
     cars, you will understand what we mean.

     10. Please tell us who killed JFK. It's been driving
     us crazy. Thank you for your cooperation.

        o     Steven Leeman
     Thanks for the funny Steven.

     =================================================================

                            By David Morferrage
                            dated 11-14-00 19:46

     The ZC Election Coordinator has submitted the following election
     outline for publication:


     Draft 4, 13NOV Version C- RC's vote based on region input. (notes,
     timetable to be adjusted later- mostly out of nomination time)

                      ZONE 1 COORDINATOR ELECTION - 2000

     The Z1C has announced an election, for a new Z1C. Per Policy4, the ZC
     is elected by the RC's under them.  It is the choice of the RC's to do
     this by the following method per P4 section 6.2.

     A Z1 Sysop is defined as any Sysop who is nodelisted in Z1 and
     physically located within the normal geographical boundries of zone 1.

     The nodelist used will be the nodelist.### version.  Reasonable
     exceptions will be made during the nomination phase by the election
     coordinator if a node, net or region is accidently dropped from this
     version and this is validated by the RC or NC of the affected node.
     The term 'nodelisted' means listed in this version of the nodelist.

                                 Nominations

                Nominating time table: NOV 17-25, 2000 All dates start at
     00:00 and end at 11:59 EST

     Any nodelisted Z1 Sysop of Fidonet may nominate themselves or another
     nodelisted Sysop of of Z1 Fidonet for the position of Z1C.  The
     nomination must be made in the Z1_Election echo and should be
     addressed to the Election Coordinator.

     The nomination must include the name of the nominee and their Fidonet
     node number.

     Once a nomination has been received by the election coordinator, the
     name will be added to the list of nominees.  The nomination must then
     be accepted by the nominee and seconded by a Z1 Sysop in the echo to
     become a fully eligible candidate.

                Discussion Period NOV 26- DEC 02, 2000 All dates start at
     00:00 and end at 11:59 EST

     Following the nomination period, a period shall be allowed for each
     candidate to campaign for the position.  During this period,
     questioning of the candidates is encouraged.

                Regional Feedback Period  DEC 03-16, 2000 All dates start
     at 00:00 and end at 11:59 EST
     FIDONEWS 17-48               Page 5                   20 Nov 2000


     Following the campaign period, the above period shall be allowed for
     each region to conduct selection proceedings in accordance with
     regional policy and such methods as are determined as appropriate
     based on regional policy or the desires of the Sysops within that
     region.  All voting or other feedback including what is desired if
     there is a run-off election and the primary candidate your region
     selected is eliminated, must be concluded no later than 16 DEC.  No
     time is alloted to conduct secondary polls of regional input once RC
     voting commences.

                Regional Coordinator Voting - DEC 17-22, 2000 All dates
     start at 00:00 and end at 11:59 EST

     Following collection of regional input, the RC's shall cast their
     vote. (Location TBD at this time).

     Initial voting will be from 17-18 DEC.  The candidate with the most
     votes, wins.  This will be calculated by a simple majority where if
     any one candidate receives 6 RC votes, they will be announced as the
     winner.  If no candidate achieves 6 RC votes, a run-off election will
     take place from 19-20 DEC between the top 2 candidates.

     Contesting of the vote will take place from 21-22 DEC.  Once finalized
     and with no RC's contesting the vote, the results will be posted in
     the Z1_ELECTION echo.

     Note, this section may be ammended after the initial Z1C election
     process has begun, in order to finalize the location of the RC votes.

                Term begin/end: Turnover date to May 2003

     Upon completion of the election, the newly elected Z1C's term begins
     as soon as turnover can be accomplished but no later than 5 January
     2001. Due to early turnover, the normal 2 year period will be extended
     5 months and end May 2003.  This is in order to avoid mandating a vote
     over the holiday season in 2 years.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     I wish to correct a few of the "not applicable" n/a designations of
     the "LINUX OS" (moving from *DOS to *NIX) FidoNews article by Janis
     Kracht.

     n/a              chsh            Change shell

          While there is no --DIRECTLY-- applicable 'chsh' command via
     *DOS, as all that 'chsh' is is a batch shell script that modifies the
     user record in the '/etc' directory folder, one can easily write a
     batch script under *DOS called 'CHSH.BAT' to modify the "start up"
     shell selection for *DOS, which in this case is stored in the
     CONFIG.SYS file of the *DOS "backslash" or root folder of the
     directory tree rather than in the 'etc' directory folder.  The "user
     record" for the *DOS shell is given below. Just as in Linux,you have
     to restart / reboot / relogin for any changes to take effect.

     File --> CONFIG.SYS SHELL=C:\DOS\COMMAND.COM C:\DOS\ /E:4096 /F /P


     n/a                pwd           Dispay the current working directory
     path

          There --IS-- a Print Working Directory for MS-DOS, but it is
     undocumented. (See the famous MicroSoft Undocumented Features, a.k.a.
     'MUF', file.)

          C:> TRUENAME

     n/a             swapon           Turn on a swap partition

     While MS-DOS doesn't have a multi-tasking Virtual Machine image to
     swap in and out of RAM, it can set up a "single task" swap area for
     the command just executed be swapped in again.  Okay, you got me!  It
     is only a disk cache, but it kind of / sort of / maybe performs a
     similar function in a single tasking operating system that a swap
     image performs in a multi-tasking operating system.

          C:> SMARTDRV.EXE /X /V

     n/a             swapoff          Turn off a swap partition

          I don't know how to turn SmartDrive off.  I think you have to
     reboot with Control-Alt-Delete?

     n/a             mount            Attach a filesystem to the root
     FIDONEWS 17-48               Page 7                   20 Nov 2000


     filesystem

          While you can not mount a filesystem onto your directory tree,
     you can do something quite similar by "mounting" phantom / virtual
     drive letters into your drive device table via the 'subst' command
     (provided that your MS-DOS 'LASTDRIVE' designation is high enough).

          C:>SUBST.EXE U: C:\USERS

     n/a             umount           Detach a filesystem from the root
     filesystem

          C:>SUBST.EXE U: /D

     n/a            apropos        Get help on a general topic n/a whatis
     Search the whatis database

          A 'whatis' / 'apropos' command --DOES-- exists for MS-DOS. (See
     below.)

          C:>FASTHELP



       That is all that I have for now.  Feel free to make any additions
     or corrections!

     Hi there Winston,

     I wish to correct a few of the "not applicable" n/a designations of

     Kracht.

     remember,I specifically mentioned in the article that I was excluding
     from consideration outside utilities like GNU tools, etc.

     Secondly, you do not have to re-boot for changes to take affect in
     Linux - you do have to re-login, but that's a far cry from rebooting.
     Like many others have done many times, I've even re-compiled the
     kernal without rebooting <smile>.

     undocumented.(See the famous MicroSoft Undocumented Features, a.k.a.
     'MUF', file.) C:> TRUENAME

     If it is undocumented, that means that MS has reservered the right to
     leave it out of future versions, or to have that command do something
     different...

     but ...

     I did miss this though:

     In DOS CD without an argument will show you the full path to the
     current working directory :)

     However, you know I didn't think i would be able to list every single
     command that DOS does not have that Linux does :)  For example.. cd -
     (cd with a space and then a dash) will take you back to the very last
     directory you were in. Not like cd .., I mean like if you type
     /home/bbbs/inbound, and then you type cd /home/ftp/pub/gamesnet, cd -
     will return you to /home/bbbs/inbound.

     n/a             swapon           Turn on a swap partition

     While MS-DOS doesn't have a multi-tasking Virtual Machine image to
     swap in and out of RAM, it can set up a "single task" swap area for
     the command just executed be swapped in again.  Okay, you got me!  It
     is only a disk cache, but it kind of / sort of / maybe performs a
     similar function in a single tasking operating system that a swap
     image performs in a multi-tasking operating system.

     C:> SMARTDRV.EXE /X /V

     n/a             swapoff          Turn off a swap partition

     I don't know how to turn SmartDrive off.  I think you have to reboot
     with Control-Alt-Delete?

     n/a             mount            Attach a filesystem to the root
     filesystem

     While you can not mount a filesystem onto your directory tree you can
     do something quite similar by "mounting" phantom / virtual drive
     letters into your drive device table via the 'subst' command
     (provided that your MS-DOS 'LASTDRIVE' designation is high enough).

     C:>SUBST.EXE U: C:\USERS

     No, you're misunderstanding mount <smile>. The mount command is not
     used for 'virtual' or logical drives but to connect physical devices
     to the file system.

     From the man page: All files accessible in a Unix system are arranged
     in one big tree, the file hierarchy, rooted at  /.   These  files can
     be spread out over several devices. The mount command serves to
     attach the file system found on some device  to the  big file tree.
     Conversely, the umount(8) command will detach it again.


     n/a            apropos         Get help on a general topic n/a whatis
     Search the whatis database

     A 'whatis' / 'apropos' command --DOES-- exists for MS-DOS. (See
     below.)

     C:>FASTHELP

     Well apropos and whatis search a database for text strings in
     different ways. Fasthelp may show you the help for a command (I don't
     know that command), but whatis shows you a short description of only
     complete word matches, apropos searches a set of database files
     containing short descriptions of system commands for keywords and
     displays them all.

     Templates that match version C, to be adapted for regional use as
     desired:

     Draft 1 template A, 12NOV - weighted voting, sysops in region vote.
     Freely available for RC's to edit as they desire to meet needs of
     region collection.

                        Z1C ELECTION - 2000

     The Z1C has announced an election, for a new Z1C. Per Policy4, the ZC
     is elected by the RC's under them.  It is the choice of the RC## to do
     this by election from the sysops in R##.

     To be eligible to vote, a SysOp must be nodelisted in R##. The
     nodelist used will be the current nodelist at the time of each stage
     in the vote. (alternative, current nodelist at time of vote)

     Those who are eligible to vote will be those SysOps who are nodelisted
     in R##.  Each sysop will be allowed 1 vote, regardless of how many
     nodenumbers they may hold.  Systems with 2 people entered as 'sysop'
     will recieve only 1 vote.

     All times refer to recipt at the election coordinators site, not time
     sent by the sysop.

               Voting Period  DEC 03-10, 2000 All dates start at 00:00 and
     end at 11:59 #ST

     Following the campaign period, a period shall be allowed for each
     eligible voter to cast his/her vote.  Votes must be sent via netmail
     (direct or routed) to the regional election coordinator who is (insert
     what's needed for your region) during the voting period and must
     include a keyword or password to the regional election coordinator.

     Votes will be cast in the following manner: Weighted voting where each
     vote cast attains a number of assigned 'points' based on the order in
     which you list them.  If you list only 1 candidate, they will receive
     as many 'points' as there are candidates.  In the sample below, that
     would be 4 'points'. You may not list a candidate more than once (IE:
     You cant get Betty Beta 10 points by listing her 4 times, sorry!).


         Example:  4 candidates: Abe Alpha            4 pts Betty Beta 3
     pts Charlie Chuckles     2 pts Donald Delta         1 pt

     Winner of the election will be the one with the most total 'points'.
     If there is a tie, recalculation will be done counting only the top 2
     votes of each member (hence your votes 3 and 4 would be cast out) to
     determine if a tie still exists. If a tie still exists, recalculation
     will commence with your first listed entry only. If that also results

     in a tie, the RC shall cast a deciding vote.

     These results will also be used by the RC, should there be a run-off
     election at the RC level voting for our region, by removing those
     candidates who were eliminated, and calculating the 'points' of the
     remaining candidates. Should this result in a tie, the RC will cast
     the deciding vote.

                 ----- ARPA History begins -----

     Part I: The history of ARPA leading up to the ARPANET

     A climate of pure research surrounded the entire history of the
     ARPANET. The Advanced Research Projects Agency was formed with an
     emphasis towards research, and thus was not oriented only to a
     military product. The formation of this agency was part of the U.S.
     reaction to the then Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik in 1957. (ARPA
     draft, III-6). ARPA was assigned to research how to utilize their
     investment in computers via Command and Control Research (CCR). Dr.
     J.C.R. Licklider was chosen to head this effort. Licklider came to
     ARPA from Bolt, Beranek and Newman, (BBN) in Cambridge, MA in October
     1962. (ARPA draft, III-6)

     From Licklider's arrival, the department's contracts were shifted from
     independent corporations towards "the best academic computer centers"
     (ARPA draft, III-7). The then current computing mode was via batch
     processing (you know, input via stacks of punched cards, output:
     results, or lack of them, made known one or more days later.).
     Licklider saw improvements could be made in CCR only via work on
     advancing the current state of computing technology. He particularly
     wanted to move forward into the age of interactive computing, and the
     current contractors were not moving in that direction. In an
     Interview, Licklider told the interviewee that SDC "was based on batch
     processing, and while I was interested in a new way of doing things,
     they [SDC] were studying how to make improvements in the ways things
     were done already." (An Interview with J.C.R. Licklider conducted by
     William Aspray and Arthur Norberg on October 28, 1988 Cambridge, Mass.
     CBI Univ of Minn., Madison) The office "developed into a far-reaching
     basic research program in advanced technology." (ARPA draft III-7)
     Licklider's Office was renamed Information Processing Techniques (IPT
     or IPTO) to reflect that change.

     The Completion report states that "Prophetically, Licklider nicknamed
     the group of computer specialists he gathered the 'Intergalactic
     Network'." ARPA draft, III-7) Before work on the ARPANET began, the
     very idea of the network was planted by the creation of the
     Information Processing Techniques Office of ARPA. Robert Taylor,
     Licklider's successor at the IPTO, remembers Lick's interest in
     interconnecting communities:

     "Lick was among the first to perceive the spirit of community created
     among the users of the first time-sharing systems... In pointing out
     the community phenomena created, in part, by the sharing of resources
     in one timesharing system, Lick made it easy to think about
     interconnecting the communities, the interconnection of interactive,
     on-line communities of people, ..." (ARPA draft, III-21)

     The "spirit of community" was related to Lick's interest in having
     computers help people communicate with other people (Licklider,
     FIDONEWS 17-48               Page 15                  20 Nov 2000


     Licklider, and Robert Taylor, "The Computer as a Communication
     Device") Licklider's vision of an "intergalactic network" connecting
     people represented an important conceptional shift in computer
     science. This vision was also an important beginning to the ARPANET.
     After the ARPANET was up and running, the computer scientists using it
     realized that assisting human communication was the most fundamental
     advance that the ARPANET made possible. (Cite Larry Roberts)

     As early as 1963, a common question asked of the IPTO directors by the
     ARPA directors about IPTO projects was "Why don't we rely on the
     computer industry to do that?", or ocassionally more strongly, "We
     should not support that effort because ABC (read, "computer industry")
     will do it - if it's worth doing!" (ARPA draft, III-23) This question
     leads to an important point - this ARPA research was different from
     what the computer industry had in mind to do - or was likely to
     undertake. Since Licklider's creation of the IPTO, the work supported
     by ARPA/IPTO continued his explicit emphasis on communications. The
     Completion Report explains,

     "The ARPA theme is that the promise offered by the computer as a
     communication medium between people, dwarfs into relative
     insignificance the historical beginnings of the computer as an
     arithmetic engine." (ARPA draft, III-24)

     The Completion Report goes on to differentiate ARPA from the computer
     industry:

     "The computer industry, in the main, still thinks of the computer as
     an arithmetic engine. Their heritage is reflected even in current
     designs of their communication systems.' They have an economic and
     psychological commitment to the arithmetic engine model, and it can
     die only slowly..." (ARPA draft, III-24)

     The Completion Report further analyzes this problem by tracing it back
     to the nation's institutions:

     "...furthermore, it is a view that is still reinforced by most of the
     nation's computer science programs. Even universities, or at least
     parts of them, are held in the grasp of the arithmetic engine
     concept...." (ARPA draft, III-24)

     Since Licklider's creation of the IPTO, the work supported by
     ARPA/IPTO continued the explicit communications emphasis. Thus history
     has witnessed the research and development which had led to the
     concrete existence of first the ARPANET, and later the Internet.
     Without the commitment that existed via this support, such a
     development might never have happened. One of ARPA's criterion for
     supporting research was such that it had to be of such a level to
     offer an order of magnitude of development. As most research and
     development is not immediately profitable, there has to be some kind
     of organization which helps to set higher goals than just in
     developing what will be immediately profitable. What is really strange
     is that computer networking is an immensely profitable field right now
     - only it is 25 years later.

     Others have understood the communications promise of computers. For
     FIDONEWS 17-48               Page 16                  20 Nov 2000


     example, in RFC 1336, David Clark is quoted,

     "It is not proper to think of networks as connecting computers.
     Rather, they connect people using computers to mediate. The great
     success of the internet is not technical, but in human impact.
     Electronic mail may not be a wonderful advance in Computer Science,
     but it is a whole new way for people to communicate. The continued
     growth of the Internet is a technical challenge to all of us, but we
     must never loose sight of where we came from, the great change we have
     worked on the larger computer community, and the great potential we
     have for future change."

     Various research outside of ARPA had been done by Paul Baron, Thomas
     Marill and others. [This history is covered well in the article "From
     ARPANET to USENET" by Ronda Hauben..ref] This led Lawrence Roberts and
     other IPTO staff to formally introduce the topic of networking
     computers of differing types (incompatible hardware and software)
     together in order to share resources to the early 1967 meeting of
     ARPA's Primary Investigators (PI).

     In the spring of 1967 at the University of Michigan, ARPA held its
     yearly meeting of the "principle investigators" from each of its
     university and other contractors. (ARPA draft, III-25) Results from
     the previous year's research was summarized and future research was
     discussed, either introduced by ARPA or the various researchers
     present at the meetings. Networking was one of the topics brought up
     at this meeting. (ARPA draft, III-25)

     The Completion Report continues the story:

     "At the meeting it was agreed that work could begin on the conventions
     to be used for exchanging messages between any pair of computers in
     the proposed network, and also on consideration of the kinds of
     communications lines and data sets to be used. In particular, it was
     decided that the inter-host communication 'protocol' would include
     conventions for character and block transmission, error checking and
     retransmission, and computer and user identification. Frank
     Westervelt, then of the University of Michigan, was picked to write a
     position paper on these areas of communication, an ad hoc
     'Communication Group' was selected from among the institutions
     represented, and a meeting of the group scheduled." (ARPA draft,
     III-26)

     In order to develop this network of varied computers, two main
     problems had to be solved:

     " 1. To construct a 'subnetwork' consisting of telephone circuits and
     switching nodes whose reliability, delay characteristics, capacity,
     and cost would facilitate resource sharing among computers on the
     network.

     2. To understand , design, and implement the protocols and procedures
     within the operating systems of each connected computer, in order to
     allow the use of the new subnetwork by the computers in sharing
     resources." (ARPA not draft, II-8)

     FIDONEWS 17-48               Page 17                  20 Nov 2000


     After one draft and additional work on this communications position
     paper report, a two-day meeting was scheduled in early October 1967 by
     ARPA to "discuss the protocol paper and specifications for the
     Interface Message Processor (IMP)." The IMP was the decided upon
     method of connecting the participants computers (hosts) to each other
     via phone lines. This standardized the network which the hosts
     connected to. Now, only the connection of the hosts to the network
     would depend on vendor type, etc. ARPA had picked 19 possible
     participants in what was now known as the "ARPA Network", rather than
     the previously vague descriptions.

     After the time of the 1967 PI Meeting, various computer scientists who
     were ARPA contractors were busy thinking about various aspects which
     would be relevant to the planning and development of the ARPANET. Part
     of that work was a document outlining a beginning design for the IMP
     network. This specification would lead to the ability to a put out a
     competitive procurement for the design of the IMP subnetwork.

     "At the end of 1967 ARPA initiated a small contract with the Stanford
     Research Institute for the development of specifications for the
     necessary communications system. Elmer Shapiro was to be the key
     person on this study. Published in the final version in December of
     1968 was a 71-page SRI report entitled "A Study of COmputer Network
     Design Parameters", an early version in early 1968 served as the first
     draft of the IMP specification...In February or March a memo written
     by Shapiro and revised by Kleinrock entitled "Functional Description
     of the IMP" was circulated. After the first draft by Shapiro, it is
     believed that Glenn Culler wrote a second draft, and Robert and
     Wessler of ARPA wrote the final version of the IMP specification. In
     any case, by the first of March, 1968, IPT was able to report to the
     Director of ARPA that specifications for the IMP were essentially
     complete, and that they would be discussed at the upcoming PI meeting
     with the goal of issuing a Request for Quotation shortly thereafter.
     The network was discussed at the PI meeting and by June 1968, the
     ARPANET procurement officially started." (ARPA draft, III-32)

     ARPA's Program Plan for the ARPANET was titled "Resource Sharing
     Computer Networks". It was submitted June 3, 1968, and approved by the
     Director June 21, 1968.

     The Completion Report explains that the Program Plan was, "an
     interesting document. The stated objectives of the program were to
     develop experience in interconnection computers and to improve and
     increase computer research productivity through resource sharing.
     Technical needs in scientific and military environments were cited as
     justification for the program objectives. Relevant prior work was
     described. It was noted that the computer research centers supported
     or partially supported by IPT provided a unique testbed for computer
     networking experiments, as well as providing immediate benefits to the
     centers and valuable research results to the military. The network
     planning that had gone on was described, the need for a network
     information center was noted, and the network design was sketched. A
     five year schedule for network procurement, construction, operation,
     and transfer out of ARPA was presented. (It was noteworthy that IPT
     had initially had in mind eventual transfer of the operational network
     to a common carrier.) Finally a several-million-dollar, several-year
     FIDONEWS 17-48               Page 18                  20 Nov 2000


     budget was stated." (ARPA draft, III-35)

     "The Defense Supply Service - Washington (DSS-W) agreed to be a
     procurement agent for ARPA. At the end of July the Request for
     Quotation for network IMPs was mailed to 140 potential bidders who had
     expressed interest in receiving it. Approximately 100 people from 51
     companies attended a subsequent bidders' conference. Twelve proposals
     were actually received by DSS_W comprising 6.6 edge-feet of paper and
     presenting an awesome evaluation task for IPT, which more normally
     awards contracts on a sole source basis. Attempting to evaluate the
     proposals "strictly by the book", an ARPA-appointed evaluation
     committee retired to Monterey, California, to carry out their task.
     ARPA was pleasantly surprised that several of the respondents believed
     that they could construct a network which performed as much as a
     factor of five better than the delay constraint given in the RFQ..."
     (ARPA draft, III-35)

     ARPA developed a program plan, which developed into a set of
     specifications. These specifications were connected to a competitive
     Request for Quotation to find an organization which would design and
     build the subnetwork between the IMPs.

     BBN won the contract to develop the IMP-to-IMP subnetwork. However the
     second technical problem still remained to be solved. The protocol to
     allow the hosts to communicate with each other over the subnetwork had
     to be developed. This work was left "for host sites to work out among
     themselves." (ARPA draft, III-67) This meant that both the hardware
     and software necessary to connect the hosts to the IMP subnetwork had
     to be developed. ARPA assigned this duty to the initial designated
     ARPANET sites. As each site had a different type of computer to
     connect, they individually were the best informed designers for their
     personal setups. In addition the sites needed to develop the hardware
     and software necessary to utilize the other hosts on the network.
     (ARPA draft, III-39) ARPA's assigning of responsibilities makes the
     academic computer science community become an active part of the
     ARPANET development team. (Interview with Alex McKenize, Nov, 1 1993)

     Steve Crocker associates the placement of the initial ARPANET sites at
     research institutions to the fact that the ARPANET was ground-breaking
     research. He wrote in a message responding to my questions on the
     COM-PRIV mailing list:

     "During the initial development of the Arpanet, there was simply a
     limit as to how far ahead anyone could see and manage. The IMPs were
     placed in cooperative ARPA R&D sites with the hope that these research
     sites would figure out how to exploit this new communication medium."
     (Crocker, 1993A)

     The first sites of the ARPANET were picked to provide either network
     support services or unique resources. They were also picked as deemed
     technically able of developing the protocols necessary to make
     communications between the varied computers connected possible. The
     key services the first four sites provided were

     "UCLA - Network Measurement Center SRI - Network Information Center
     UCSB - Culler-Fried interactive mathematics UTAH - graphics (hidden
     FIDONEWS 17-48               Page 19                  20 Nov 2000


     line removal)" (Cerf, Vinton 1993)

     Steve Crocker also recounts that the reason for selecting these
     particular four sites was because they were "existing ARPA computer
     science research contractors." This was important because "the
     research community could be counted on to take some initiative." (RFC
     1000, pg 1)

     The very first site to receive an IMP was UCLA. Professor Leonard
     Kleinrock of UCLA was involved with much of the early development of
     the ARPANET. His work consisted of understanding queueing theory and
     as such was one of the first computer scientists working on the
     ARPANET who was dealing with how to measure what was happening as the
     network would function. This made it natural to make sure that UCLA
     received the first node as it would be important to initiate the
     network from the site which would measure the networks activity. In
     order for the statistics to be correct and for analysis purposes - the
     first site had to be the measurement site. Sure enough UCLA was
     assigned to be the Network Measurement Center (NMC).[1]

                   Jim Smoot Report by Bob Seaborn
                            ~~~~~~~~~
     This goes back to the late-early days of Fidonet (about 10 years ago).
     The major distribution was set up and functioning, and a couple of
     talented programmers came along from Holland. One, Harald Harms, wrote
     and developed ALLFIX, a quality file-tosser, that is still extensively
     used today.  A second, Gerard van der Land, wrote Gecho, an extremely
     powerful echomail tosser, which while not being continued today,
     influenced the development of similar programs.

     With these developments came a Fidonet sysop, one Jim Smoot, at the
     time living in Texas, having retired from the US military, who worked
     with these programmers, and others, to market the fruits of their
     labour under what became known as the RegSite Team, at one time having
     members world-wide.  Jim also actively developed a series of beta
     teams to work with the programmers and debug the developing programs,
     as well as test new features.  During this time, Jim also represented
     other programs, including InterMail/InterEcho, Telemate, and many
     others. The RegSite Team and beta teams are still functioning today.


     About 3 years ago, Jim's health dramatically failed, he was diagnosed
     with severe emphysema, resulting in very low lung function.  This was
     primarily caused by his military activities, coupled with years of
     smoking.  He also moved from Texas to Tennessee, to be closer to his
     immediate family (and the NASCAR tracks).  After various up's and
     down's, he was placed on the waiting list for a lung transplant.  Well
     the time finally arrived, last evening (November 13, 2000) I received
     the following email from him:


     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     Date: Tue, 13 Nov 2000 08:08:14 From: Jim & Nancy Smoot Subject: The
     time is upon us .....


     Only have a few minutes, but the Transplant Coordinator at H.H.
     McQuire Hospital in Richmond, VA called and they have a left lung for
     me. Ergo, they are sending a Jet Air Ambulance to Springfield for to
     pick me and Miz Nancy up and fly us to Richmond where they are going
     to replace my left lung tonight.  They haven't even taken the lung out
     of the other person yet.....keeping him/her on a life support system
     until they can get me there.  Beyond that, I have NO clue if its a guy
     or a girl's lung, not any of the circumstances involved with the
     person, nor how old or young (s)he is.

     I have a GREAT team of Pulmo Doctors up there, and their after surgery
     care is out of this world ..... really good.  But, there is ALWAYS
     that element of chance in a procedure such as this ..... I just hope
     they are all sober tonight and feeling good.  :)

     Gotta run; will keep everyone posted on whats what and how everything
     FIDONEWS 17-48               Page 21                  20 Nov 2000


     is going on with me.  Miz Nancy is already in a dither, running around
     here like a chicken with her head cut off ..... but she DOES have a
     method to her madness, I guarantee. I can already see some of her
     "doings" starting to fall into place.  :)

             Thats it ..... gotta scoot.  C U later, gang.

      All The Best,

       --- J. Smoot
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

     I did have a chance to briefly talk with Jim prior to his leaving
     Springfield, and while he sounded somewhat worried, he was in
     excellent spirits, joking about his flight north.  I wished him the
     best.  At the time, he asked me to let his many Fido friends know what
     was happening with him.


     It was obviously a long sleepless night for Jim's family and close
     friends, and early this morning I received a phobe call from Lisa, his
     youngest daughter, who reported that as of 7:45 EST, Jim was still in
     the operating room, and the doctors were optimistic as to the
     prognosis. She sounded very worried and upset, albeit somewhat calm.
     Reported that she was in better shape than Nancy, her mother.


     Then about 12:15 EST Lisa called again to report that Jim was out of
     the operating room, and in recovery, and all is good.  He will be kept
     there for a couple of hours, then woken up and moved to the Intensive
     Care Unit for a couple of days, during which time he will be asked to
     walk around to get the lung functional.  After that, they will be
     monitoring him for signs of rejection.  Lisa sounded very relieved,
     and reported that Nancy (her mother) was in high spirits.  I gathered
     that the plans were to keep him there for a few weeks.

     Warren:

     I realize that I'm in the running for FidoNet's Resident Curmudgeon
     position, and I'm not trying to pick on you, but you've really, really
     got to get an improved Paul Harvey/Ann Landers[1] filter.  The
     *documented* history of the bugle call we now know as "taps" is much
     more interesting and considerably less maudlin.
                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Editor's note: Not a contest to see who's version is correct or all
     that accurate, rather everyone's point of view considered. Might I add
     that Westpoint's *documentation* came long after Captain Ellicomb was
     a dim memory.  Legends often are the root of true history.

                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     From www.west-point.org/taps/Taps.htm

     The Story of Taps:
     Ed-note: {Remodeled to please the Army brass at Westpoint}

     The 24-note melancholy bugle call known as "taps" is thought to be a
     revision of a French bugle signal, called "tattoo" that notified
     soldiers to cease an evening's drinking and return to their garrisons.
     It was sounded an hour before the final bugle call to end the day by
     extinguishing fires and lights. The last five measures of the tattoo
     resemble taps.

     The word "taps" is an alteration of the obsolete word "taptoo" derived
     from the Dutch "taptoe."  Taptoe was the command - "Tap toe!" - to
     shut "toe to") the "tap" of a keg.

     The revision that gave us present-day taps was made during America's
     Civil War by Union Gen. Daniel Adams Butterfield, heading a brigade
     camped at Harrison Landing, Va., near Richmond. Up to that time, the
     U.S. Army's infantry call to end the day was the French final call,
     "L'Extinction des feux."; Gen. Butterfield decided the "lights out"
     music was too formal to signal the day's end. One day in July 1862 he
     recalled the tattoo music and hummed a version of it to an aide, who
     wrote it down in music. Butterfield then asked the brigade bugler,
     Oliver W. Norton, to play the notes and, after listening, lengthened
     and shortened them while keeping his original melody.

     He ordered Norton to play this new call at the end of each day
     thereafter, instead of the regulation call. The music was heard
     and appreciated by other brigades, who asked for copies and adopted
     this bugle call. It was even adopted by Confederate buglers.

     This music was made the official Army bugle call after the war, but
     not given the name "taps" until 1874.

     The first time taps was played at a military funeral may also have
     been in Virginia soon after Butterfield composed it.  Union Capt. John
     Tidball, head of an artillery battery, ordered it played for the
     burial of a cannoneer killed in action. Not wanting to reveal the
     battery's position in the woods to the enemy nearby, Tidball
     substituted taps for the traditional three rifle volleys fired over
     the grave. Taps was played at the funeral of Confederate Gen.
     Stonewall Jackson 10 months after it was composed. Army infantry
     regulations by 1891 required taps to be played at military funeral
     ceremonies.

     Taps now is played by the military at burial and memorial services, to
     accompany the lowering of the flag and to signal the "lights out"
     command at day's end.

                    ----- taps.txt ends -----

     A few of the sites note that there are several different versions
     of the lyrics, which were not appended to the bugle call until
     several years after its adoption by the US Army.

     Also, there's no evidence that Captain Ellicombe, USA (or, in some
     versions, Ellison) ever existed during the USAian "war between the
     states", much less that he stumbled across his own dead son in
     CSA uniform.  That bit right there should have set off Urban Legend
     alarms.

     and, of course, the first place to look:
     www.snopes.com/spoons/fracture/taps.htm

     IIRC, the snopes site includes links to a site with transcriptions
     of correspondence with Captain Butterfield and his recollections
     of the events.
     Ed-Note: Proof that the Army Brass designed this version, and in my
     mind was an after thought to the original, no disrespect to the Gen.

     long known for masterful retellings of compelling but false stories
     and Ann Landers, advice to the lovelorn columnist, long known for her
     lack of research and willingness to publish the most silly things.

     Ed-note: Bringing Paul and Ann into this as some kind of
     substantiation of your findings is totally irrelevant as they wrote
     neither version of "TAPS".

     Hi,
     I was a member of FidoNet 1989-1994, being 3:690/611, 3:690/633,
     3:691/133, 3:691/196, among others.  I recall at the time there was
     always a lot of infighting in the heirarchies, and there was always
     the onerous ZMH "technical" requirement, and there was always the
     secretive admin echoes, to which everyone gets calendestine access
     anyway......

     But I recall most vividly, I was just thinking of it the other day
     actually, one particular issue of FidoNews which contained an email
     from a certain Kwityer Bitchin ......

     In the email, Kwityer set about most eloquently describing the woes of
     the time.  Which were, of course, all political in nature.

     Now, ten years have passed, and I by accident find www.fido.net ... I

     feel like I have come home -- for a moment, until I realize why it was
     I left.  You folks are just the same!  You could dig up that copy of
     FidoNews from ten years ago, read Kwityer's article, and it would hold
     true, to the letter.

     I write you this email via the heirarchy-free internet, where
     protecting free speech means being able to say what you want, not
     hiding what you say in sysop conferences, because I am, to be honest,
     disappointed that after all this time, there has been no change in the
     FidoNet approach.

     You even have the same old policy 4.

     I am a FidoNet veteran -- yet still I was taken aback by the roasting
     I found at the very top of the editorial of the latest edition of
     fidonews on the web.  Let's consider this.  Imagine how many dog-
     lovers are having nightmares after inadvertently visiting the fidonet
     websites.  Is there no sense of customer relations over there?  Is the
     fidonews website for sharing information, or just another political
     tool?

     Don't worry, Kwityer answered that question a decade ago.

     Noot: een oude bekende Low Speed Split Bitrate verbinding was
     1200rx/75tx ;-). Vandaar de min of meer verplichte InterSpeedBuffer !
     Zeker bij PC's die geen splitrate op hun seriele poort aankonden.

     Ook nieuw is V44 een opvolger van V42bis OnLine DataCompressie. V44
     maakt gebruik van het LZJH algoritme en heeft daardoor een maximale
     OnLine Compressie verhouding van 1:6 tegen 1:4 bij V42bis, 25% beter
     dus.

     Vermoedelijk zijn V92 en V44 de laatste wijzigingen voor het analoge
     modem ? Immers na die tijd komen ISDN-, ADSL- en CAI-Coaxkabel-modems
     op de voorgrond.

     Wie weet er meer over V92 en V44? Tot nu toe heb ik er nog zeer weinig
     tot niets van gehoord. Ik wilde mijn ZyXEL Elite 2864 modem (V34) met
     een flashrom upgraden naar V90, maar ik denk dat ik beter even kan
     wachten, totdat ook de V92 flashromimage beschikbaar is ?

     Ben heel benieuwd naar jullie reacties en tot wedermails.

     Subject: Dead or alive?
     A kindergarten teacher had a pupil tell her he had found a frog.
     She inquired as to whether it was alive or dead.  "Dead," she was
     informed.

     "How do you know?" she asked.

     "Because I pissed in it's ear," said the child innocently.

     "You did WHAT?" squealed the teacher in surprise.

     "You know," explained the boy, "I leaned over and went 'PSSST'.
     It didn't move."

                   Guess who may run for President 2008
                   ------------------------------------

     Bill and Hillary are out driving in the country near Hillary's
     hometown. They are low on fuel, so Bill pulls into a  gas station for
     a fill-up.  The attendant comes out and begins to pump gas into the
     first couple's tank. As he is doing this, he looks into the  passenger
     window. "Hey, Hillary. We used to date in high school, do you remember
     me?" he asks. They chat for a few minutes, Bill pays and  the first
     couple leaves. As they drive Bill is feeling very proud of  himself
     and looks over at Hillary. "You used to date that guy?  Just think
     what it would be like if you had married him, "he says smugly. Hillary
     looks at Bill and shrugs. Then she replies, "Well I guess you'd be
     pumping gas and he would be the President

        Little Johnny watched, fascinated, as his mother
              smoothed cold cream on her face.
           "Why do you do that mommy?"  he asked.

      "To make myself beautiful," said his mother, who then
           began removing the cream with a tissue.

      "What's the matter?" asked Little Johnny.  "Giving up?"

     ---------------------------------------------------------
     Celebrating Holidays

     An atheist complained to a friend, "Christians have
     their special holidays, such as Christmas and Easter;
     and Jews celebrate their holidays, such as Passover
     and Yom Kippur; Muslims have their holidays.  EVERY
     religion has its holidays.  But we atheists," he said,
     "have no recognized national holidays.  It's an unfair
     discrimination." His friend replied, "Well...  Why
     don't you celebrate April first?"

     Popemobile
                         POPE'S LIMOUSINE

     The Pope had just finished a tour of the East Coast and was
     taking a limousine to the airport. Having never driven a
     limo, he asked the chauffeur if he could drive for a while.
     Without much of a choice, the chauffeur climbed in the back
     of the limo and the Pope took the wheel.
     After gleefully accelerating to about 90 mph, the Pope was
     pulled over by the State Patrol. The trooper came to his
     window, took a look inside, and said, "Just a moment,
     please. I need to call in."
     The trooper called in and asked for the chief. He told the
     chief, "I've got a REALLY important person pulled over and
     I need to know what to do."
     The chief replied, "Who is it? A senator?"
     The trooper said, "No, even more important."
     The chief asked, "It's the Governor, isn't it?"
     "No. More important."
     "The President?"
     "No. More important."
     "Well, Who the heck is it?!," screams the chief.
     "I don't know," said the trooper. "But he's got the Pope as
     a chauffeur."
     ---------------------------------------------------------

     Every Sunday, a little old lady placed $1,000 in the collection plate.
     After several weeks the priest was overcome with curiosity and
     approached her. "I couldn't help but notice that you put $1,000 a week
     in the collection plate,"

     "Why yes," she replied, "every week my son sends me money, and what I
     don't need I give to the church."

     "That's wonderful, how much does he send you?"

     "Oh, about $2,000 a week."

     "Your son must be very successful, what does he do for a living?"

     "He's a veterinarian," she answered.

     "That is an honorable profession. Where does he practice?"

     "Well, he has one cat house in Kansas City and another in Dallas".

                          Coin Flip
     I'm sure that the idea of tossing a coin for the presidency is not
     original but I suggest a coin toss with a little extra twist. The
     Secretary of the Treasury should go to the mint and procure a brand
     new silver dollar. (Are we still making silver dollars?) The dollar
     should then be tossed into the air and the winner of the toss will
     then have his choice of either the presidency or the silver dollar.
     If he's smart he'll take the dollar.

     A keen Texas lad applied for a salesman's job at a city
     department store. The store was the biggest in the world
     and sold everything under the sun.

     "Have you ever been a salesman before?" the boss asked
     during his interview.

     "Yes, I was a salesman in Texas," the lad answered. The
     boss took an immediate liking to him and told him he
     could start the next day.

     "I'll come and see how you made out after we close up,"
     the boss said.

     The day was long and hard for the young man, but finally
     it was 5 o'clock. The boss closed up the store and found
     the lad sitting, slumped and exhausted, in a chair. "How
     many sales did you make today?" the boss asked.

     "One," said the lad.

     "One?" said the boss, obviously displeased. "Most of the
     sales people on my staff make 20 or 30 sales a day. How
     much was the sale worth?"

     "Exactly $101,334.53," said the young man.

     "How did you manage that?!?" asked the boss,
     flabbergasted.

     "Well," said the lad, "this man came in and I sold him a
     small fish hook, then a medium fish hook, and finally a
     really large hook. Then I sold him a small fishing line, a
     medium one, and huge one. I asked him where he was
     going fishing, and he said he was going down the coast. I
     said he'd probably need a boat, so I took him down to
     the boat department and sold him that fancy 22-foot
     Chris Craft with twin engines. Then he said his Honda
     Civic probably wouldn't be able to handle the load, so I
     took him to the vehicle department and sold him a new
     GMC 1-ton pickup truck."

     "You sold all that to guy who came in for a fish hook?"
     the boss asked in astonishment.

     "He didn't come in to buy a fish hook," the Texas boy
     explained. "He came in to buy a box of tampons for his
     wife, and I said to him, 'Your weekend's shot. You might
     as well go fishing.' "

     Jeff Smith just said he wanted sysop-level, Carol said she wanted
     sysop-level. Darrell wanted sysop-level. Adding you makes four.

     How on earth did the vote come to be 8-2?

     If you said you supported sysop level elections, but voted in favour
     of an election policy that removed them, just say so. No one here will
     notice, I guarantee it.

     Hello All!

     In light of all those clammorring for open access to the Z1REGCON
     echo, all three of them, I am backboning an echo which has a purpose
     similiar to that put in place by Ward Dossche regarding the ZCC echo.
     ZCC-PUBLIC is an echo that allows some posts from the super secret
     Zone Coordinator Council echo to be made public, I believe most of
     which are authored by Ward or posted by Ward with permission in those
     cases when he isnt the author.

     I realize that this is not gonna alleviate all the fears expressed,
     but you can either take it or leave it, lets see if it works?

     I hope to have it backboned within a week or so, the elist message
     has been sent, the tagname is RCC-PUBLIC.

     Here are the rules:

                                    [Purpose Of Echo]

     A place in which each Zone One RC can at their option, crosspost into
     here anything that they posted in the Z1REGCON echo for the
     consumption of the rest of the ZONE.

     Know this:

     * If a message is posted in here from Z1REGCON, it must have been done
     so via its author.

     * Assuming the above, message replies may not be false ones to reveal
     the contents of another RC's message, in order to satisfy the above
     unless steps are taken to protect the identity of the person being
     replied to.

     * Messages may not be forwarded into here from Z1REGCON unless the
     person doing the forwarding is the author of the message being
     forwarded.

     * Participation in this echo by ANY Zone One RC is optional, do not
     draw any inference via any lack of participation by any Zone One RC.

     * Scully and Mulder can be found on your nearest FOX TV station, look
     for conspiracies with them but not in here.

     * You are encouraged to engage in any dialogues that may result from
     what got posted here, however also use this echo as tool to engage
     your OWN RC in the regional forums appropriate for you.

                [Access and Other Things]

     * This echo may not be distributed beyond Fidonet Zone One.

     * This echo may not be gated into othernets(tm).

     * Only Listed Fidonet sysops may access. This means not for general
     consumption by your BBS users, we dont need a matzdobre. <g>

     Beyond this, the usual and typical etiquette should apply including
     but not limited to:

     * Real names only.

     * No excessive quoting.

     * Keep the profanity in check.

     a @ preceding an individual's name implies a virtual email
     address. The email is translated as follows
     firstlast@osirusoft.com will automatically route to the
     appropriate individual's email.  Anyone in this list will
     also receive routed notice of this feature.  In my case, it
     would still be joejared@osirusoft.com, but you get the idea.

     Also, as information is provided to me, I will be adding a
     latency field to each node, which is defined as the maximum
     time between when the message is received, and when it is
     sent on to other nodes, or available to be sent onward,
     defined in minutes. A latency of ! implies that there is an
     immediate response, and an attempt to deliver immediately
