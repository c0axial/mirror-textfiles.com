     Zone 2 Excommunicated!
     ----------------------

     Zone 3 excommunicated Zone 2 last week, and I have to tell you it
     was a lot of fun. Those who met me at FidoCon know I've been
     really itching to excommunicate someone, but even they will be
     amazed at the grand scope of this effort . . .

     It was _almost_ as good as the one I had planned at San Jose --
     top of my list there was Tom Jennings. That's one way to make
     people sit up and take notice of a new IC, huh?

     Truth is, the Zone 2 'excommunication' was but a small teething
     problem in an otherwise worthwhile plan. We instituted a new
     method of nodelist update distribution between the Zone
     Coordinators last week, and it seems likely that from this week
     on all Zone nodelists will be 'in synch' for the first time in
     several years.

     Because of time differences from Zone to Zone, and with some
     Zones afflicted by poor phone lines and high costs, it has been
     particularly difficult to get all the Zone nodelist segments
     shipped around the world quickly enough.

     The new method relies on some fairly smart footwork by the ZCs
     and the Zonegates, but it looks like it will work well. Next week
     Zone 3 has even promised to reinstate Zone 2.

     My thanks go to the ZCs and especially to the volunteer gate
     operators, Randy Bush and Dick Gladden in Zone 1, Joop
     Mellaart and Peter Janssens in Zone 2, and Luis Tombo (and now Pablo
     Kleinman) in Zone 4. If they keep this up I think I'll double
     their salaries . . .


     I'm Excessively Annoying
     ------------------------

     Boy, did we make a big mistake deciding to give the IC a listing
     in each Zone. Hindsight is a wonderful thing -- it's now quite
     clear to me what a disaster we inflicted on people.

     What happened when someone in Zone 1 entered a message to
     Matt Whelan? Their message editor dutifully plucked the 1:1/1000
     address from FidoUser.Lst, and their packer dutifully sent the
     message direct to my system in Sydney, Australia. Oh dear.

     It may make some of you feel a little better to know the first
     person who placed an IDD call was Steve Bonine, but it didn't
     make Steve and I feel good.

     Worse was to come, however. Bob Hartman sent me a simple message,
     and his system made several calls without ever getting through the
     transfer. So I decided to call him and 'collect' the message to
     stop his system feeding the Telco.

     Did I know which of my node numbers he was calling? Nah! So it
     took about 10 calls including the failed connects before I
     finally woke up to what was happening and dialed in as 1:1/1000.

     Harry Lee was our next victim. Fortunately he had a cleaner line,
     and got his message through first time. Others may have tried and
     failed for all I know; if so, I must offer to them as sincere an
     apology as I offer to Steve, Bob and Harry.

     The out-of-zone entries for the IC have been pulled from the
     nodelist this week. If you want to talk to me, send a message to
     3:712/627 or 3:3/1000 and let the Zonegates do the talking . . .

     [Tricking people into making international calls is pretty
     annoying -- with any luck someone will complain and I'll get to
     excommunicate the IC. Yeah!]

     A letter from a FidoNet Sysop

     Dear colleague,
             To start,  I  give  you my apologies for choosing such an
     "ordinary" topic for this letter.

             We have all  seen  and  sometimes participated (and still
     see and sometimes still participate) on  a  big  discussion  that
     involved  (and  still involves) a big (if  not  all)  of  FidoNet
     during the last months.

             POLICY4  was  (is)  the  controversial  matter,  the very
     center of that discussion.

             I,  myself,  had  some  problems  with  the International
     Coordinator regarding the new POLICY:   I  don't agree with a lot
     of things, especially with the distribution of power along the *C
     structure,  to  which  I  belong  both  as  Regional    and  Zone
     coordinator, and with the methods adopted for elections.

             If I would be power-hungry, I could just sit down and say
     nothing:  I'm probably the  most  power-secure  individual in the
     net,  as it is impossible to  anyone  (following  the  procedures
     specified in POLICY4) to remove me.

             But I'm obviously not (I'm writing this, right now).  And
     I expressed that from the beginning to David Dodell and others.

             Before  voting  for  POLICY4,  we  [Z4  sysops] protested
     because we were not invited to  participate  on  its writing, and
     informed the IC that we wanted a  chance  to propose some changes
     before it was finally approved.  But David  Dodell didn't give us
     any answer at all, he simply ignored the text.

             POLICY4    was  unanimously  rejected  by  the  whole  *C
     structure of Zone 4, especially  by  myself.   The reason:  while
     I'm not sure if "democracy" would  be  the best way to handle the
     net, I'm positively against any kind of "aristocracy".

             POLICY4  is definitely aristocratic, and that aristocracy
     is made up by the RCs and ZCs.

             That does not mean that the RCs and  ZCs are the bad guys
     on this  story, or that they have bad intentions.  I have treated
     the ZCs for  a while already, and sincerely trust on the ZCs good
     intentions.  I'm a  Regional  and  Zone  coordinator  myself, and
     trust on my good intentions :-).

             But the legitimacy of the  power  structure at FidoNet is
     questionable for many.

             But with more discussions and x-large  FidoNews  we won't
     change anything, or at least, we won't get any positive results.

             In Zone 4, POLICY4 was approved only last  week  (by Z4's
     *C structure), and  if  it  was,  it  was  done on a "preliminary
     basis", which means that  the  decision  could be reverted if the
     same people vote against it anytime.

             We [the representatives of Zone 4] voted for POLICY4 just
     to avoid more trouble with the IC.

             But I won't wait a second this time:  something has to be
     done, as soon as possible.

             I  personally  don't trust in revolutions:   they  always
     bring more problems than the ones they eradicate.

             My  proposal  is  to  "go  slowly but steadily":    let's
     propose some essential changes in POLICY4.

             For  example,  I'd  like  the  NCs to participate in  the
     elections;  and think this could be a good start for  bringing  a
     democratic form of administration for FidoNet.

             I took  the  initiative  and  added  a node named "Change
     Policy4!" in the nodelist,  with  the  number  4:4/5 (the Policy5
     Project).

             The Policy5 Project will write  a  Policy5 proposal, that
     when finished, will be presented to the  whole *C structure to be
     voted.

             But  if we want a Policy representing the  views  of  the
     majority of FidoNet, we  definitely need participation.  Consider
     yourself from now, invited to participate in the Policy5 Project.
     We do need YOU!  FidoNet needs YOU!

             We will soon start an echomail  conference  to talk about
     each matter,  and  to let everyone express his/her views and make
     proposals for each  topic.  And we need desperately YOUR help, to
     distribute the P5PROJECT echo in zones 1, 2 and 3.

             Please, contact us right  now:   this is your best chance
     to get involved.

             I hope you got the  basic  idea.    If  you  have further
     questions, please don't hesitate to ask.

             Thank  you in advance for all  your  help  in  writing  a
     better policy for a better FidoNet, and for  taking  the  time to
     read this text.

     What needs to be done, and NOW!

     by Phil Buonomo, 1:107/583, 7:520/583, 9:807/1

     For several months, you've been seeing articles written by yours
     truly here which have been critical of the *C administration.
     These articles began with my outrage over several RC's attempts
     to wrest control of editorial privilege from the Editor of Fido-
     News based on the idea that "they pay to have it distributed".

     This incident was only one of a series of incidents involving the
     *C structure which date back to the original creation and "pass-
     ing" of Policy 4.  Even before it was adopted, we had people like
     Steve Bonine threatening an NC with removal because he hadn't
     "jumped" fast enough, installing certain nodelist flags.

     Then Policy 4 was 'voted in' in a secret ballot (ask Dave Dodell
     to publish the FULL results, not just the vote count) in a two
     week period (for a six thousand node network!?!).  Zone 2 rejec-
     ted it, Zone 4 rejected it, but it was shoved in place by the US
     RC's anyway.

     Then Jim Grubs was thrown out of the nodelist (by Steve Bonine,
     no less) for defying the legitimacy of Policy 4.

     Net 154 was thrown out in its entirety for having 3 nodes which
     were "outside the traditional geographic boundaries" of its
     network.  It didn't matter that these nodes were nowhere near
     being close to any other network.  It was the failure of the NC
     to cowtow to the RC that caused the networks removal "for the
     good of FidoNet".

     Net 170 had an NC appointed by the RC, and when a vote went
     against the new NC, it was disallowed by the RC because it was
     "against policy".

     An NC/NEC admits to automatically 'echo chopping' someone's mail,
     and gets away with it without so much as a "Boo!" from the *C's.

     Now, certain NEC's talk about running the backbone as if the
     systems belonged to them!  At last year's FidoCon, Butch Walker
     and Ray Gwinn both supported the idea that conferences belonged
     to the moderators, not the *C's or FidoNet, or the backbone.  Yet
     people are now taking up 'network sides' about who can or can't
     participate in a conference!

     Is it just me, or does anyone else see a pattern here?

     Listen, gang.  I've gotta tell ya something...

     All the *C's in the world may be a great bunch of guys, but when
     a network policy in place makes it IMPOSSIBLE for the little guy,
     the nodes, to have a say in things that affect him, its just
     plain WRONG.

     FidoNews 6-37                Page 7                   11 Sep 1989


     Now, a few weeks ago, Vince wrote an editorial telling people
     that wanted democracy that they had missed their chance by not
     supporting IFNA. I've come to the realization that he was right.

     I suggest that you join IFNA.  Make it strong, and make it a
     voice that can be heard.  Then, maybe you can make the following
     proposals I have come true:

     1) A self-perpetuating coordinator structure is wrong.

     2) Network nodes should select their OWN NC, not have him ap-
     pointed by some guy 3 states away who's never been in touch
     anyway.

     3) The IC should be appointed by the IFNA BoD.  That's the way it
     was done in the first place, and it was a good idea because...

     4) Everyone in the nodelist should be an "At-Large" member of
     IFNA, and get to vote for the "At-Large" BoD seats.

     With that in mind, I have no problem with the IC appointing the
     ZC's, and RC's being appointed by the ZC.

     5) With all the hysterical jumping up and down and outright
     propaganda about belonging to multiple networks, Policy should
     contain a clause on discrimination.  FidoNet should not discri-
     minate on basis of race, creed, color, sexual orientation, OR
     Network affiliation.  This should be STRICTLY enforced.

     This plan gives democracy a chance, while maintaining technical
     integrity at the top of the organization.  It also gives the
     individual node TWO voices in the management of his network, one
     in the direct election of his NC, and one in the election of the
     IFNA BoD, which would appoint the IC.

     People talk about the benefits of Top-down and Bottom-up manage-
     ment.  Well, this plan gives us all the advantages of both. It
     puts the responsibility right back where it belongs, and doesn't
     compromise the technical operation of the network.  It also pro-
     motes a strong IFNA, an idea for which I have to thank Vince
     Perriello, and his editorials in FidoNews.

     With all that's happened lately, don't you think its time the
     *C's stopped stepping on the individual nodes, and started being
     responsible TO them (read: YOU)?

     Put up or Shut Up Time     by Phil Buonomo, 1:107/583, 7:520/583

     Rhetoric time's over, folks.

     I'm on a plane flying back to Newark airport from FidoCon '89 as
     I type this.  There were a lot of things accomplished there, but
     nothing compares to the actions of the IFNA Board of Directors.

     In case you didn't know it, YOU now have a vote on deciding
     whether or not to "re-boot" FidoNet.

     Here's a little background.  Several months ago, when Policy 4
     was adopted, I became concerned with some of its pieces, pri-
     marily the sections dictating that nodes would not be able to
     select their NC's.  It seems to me that TJ had set up FidoNet
     with the intention that each net would set its own local
     policies, and POL4 overruled this.  I felt this was wrong.

     Then, I began to investigate and learn of several perceived
     abuses of policy mainly by several RC's.  I reported on these in
     FidoNews, but only the ones for which I had documentation, as I
     feel strongly that spreading rumors is poor journalism.  In doing
     so, however, I was forced to report on some actions that I don't
     think I would normally have done.  In doing so, I stepped on some
     people that frankly didn't deserve it.  I'll get to that later,
     but the point is that for each story I wrote, I received reports
     of worse abuses for which there was no documentation available.

     But writing articles in FidoNews wasn't enough.  I knew that if
     we were to have any representation of the individual nodes in
     FidoNet, that action was going have to come from outside the
     current administration.  That's when Vince Perriello published an
     editorial in FidoNews stating that the supporters of democracy
     had "missed the boat" when they failed to support IFNA.  THAT
     SAME DAY, someone close to the Board of Directors claimed that
     the reason IFNA never did anything was because they had never
     elected enough directors who had the "intestinal fortitude" to
     stand up for what they thought was right and should be done.

     It was at that point that I thought to myself, "we have an elec-
     tion coming up, why not GET some people on the board who don't
     care about the flames, are willing to get things done, and are
     willing to work together selflessly to accomplish the goal of
     bringing democratic representation back to FidoNet.  After all,
     if IFNA wasn't the representative of the "grunt sysop", what
     good WAS it?  It was at this point that I talked to several of
     my acquaintences who were members of IFNA, and convinced them to
     "bet it all" by being elected to the Board.  I campaigned in net
     mail, and was able to garner enough votes to capture 7 seats in
     the latest election.  Hardly enough for a majority, and nowhere
     near a 2/3rds majority to get By-Laws amendments passed, but
     enough to put together a block of votes that might lend us the
     ability to cut through the apathy that has been prevalent in the
     majority of the Directors in the recent past.

     Let me just say for the moment, however, that I can hardly blame
     past boards for being afraid to do anything.  They were flamed
     horribly just for setting up IFNA, and unfortunately it seems
     these days that anyone who wants to do ANYTHING to improve the
     quality of life in FidoNet gets perceived as the "son of satan".

     I explained to our slate that all they could expect of our move-
     ment were flames, insults, and general misery, but each one was
     willing to put up with all the crap because frankly, they all
     cared enough about the network to see it through.

     Once I'd lined up a slate of members, I approached the problem of
     democracy in FidoNet (AND the problems inherent with IFNA lately)
     in two phases.  Firstly, what HAD to (and could) be done NOW, and
     secondly, what couldn't be done at FidoCon, but could be done
     within about six months.

     For the short range, I envisioned IFNA opening up its membership
     to ALL nodes in FidoNet cost-free (an idea that Vince Perriello
     had actually pushed thru in the special election of earlier this
     year, but due to wording problems with the amendment, it was not
     effective).  I also saw a need for using electronic mail in the
     election process, as much of the costs that were being incurred
     by IFNA were costs of running the election, i.e., land-mailing
     ballots to all the members, paper and reproduction costs, etc.
     Thirdly, I felt that IFNA should return to its original intent of
     appointing the Vice-president/Technical Coordinator to serve as
     the International Coordinator.  This would reinstate IFNA's con-
     trol over the publication of the nodelist and the legitimization
     of its control over the administrative branch of FidoNet, the *C
     structure, on behalf of the sysops it was supposed to represent.

     I also felt that since Policies 1 through 3 had been ratified by
     the BoD, and that a previous version of Policy 4 had been rejec-
     ted by that same governing body, that they had the right and the
     duty to reject the current Policy 4 and send it back to the RC's.

     That took care of the short-term, but was obviously not enough.
     We needed a stable organization that could withstand the tests of
     time to represent our present and future sysops.  The screw-up
     regarding the new At-Large membership was just an example of a
     set of By-Laws that were self-contradicting, confusing, and to a
     great extent, completely ineffective.  For the long term, I de-
     cided to push for a re-writing of both the By-Laws of IFNA and
     the FidoNet policy, to be voted on by ALL the members of FidoNet,
     by making all the sysops at-large members. In this way, I felt
     we could give democratic representation back to the sysops.

     Well, things didn't work out completely according to plan, but
     the board DID accomplish the goal I set out to.  With people
     like Vince Perriello, Matt Whelan, Randy Bush, Bob Hartman, Tom
     Jennings, Thom Henderson, Fabian Gordon, Tony Davis, John Knox,
     Jim Cannell, Steve Jordan, Jim Dunmyer, Don Daniels, and many
     others too numerous to mention individually, working together,
     we have given the choice back to the sysops of FidoNet.  I talk-
     ed Thom Henderson into chairing the board because he knows Par-
     FidoNews 6-37                Page 10                  11 Sep 1989


     liamentary procedure and I knew we'd need to run the Board meet-
     ings civilly to keep them from degenerating into shouting matches.
     Besides which, outside of the running the meeting, the Chairman
     really has no power at all, that's held by the President who is
     the public representative of IFNA.  The Board elected Les Kooyman
     as IFNA President, one of the leaders of the DEMOCRACY movement.

     Anyway, back to business.  We have made everyone an at-large
     member of IFNA.  We have removed the postal restrictions from
     the By-Laws.  We did NOT reject Policy 4, but we did not accept
     it, either.  Either way, its probably a moot point now.  Either
     a majority of the sysops of FidoNet are going to approve of IFNA
     standing up for them, or IFNA is going to cease to exist and the
     nodes will be left with what they have now.  If that's good
     enough for the sysops of FidoNet, so be it.  I've accomplished
     my goal.  Now its up to YOU to let us know how you feel.  This
     may well be your last chance to vote yourselves a democratic
     administration.  By the way, that proposal needs a 50% majority
     of the sysops in the nodelist, NOT just a majority of the votes.
     A NON-VOTE IS A NO VOTE, FOLKS!

     The bottom line is that if you want democracy in FidoNet, you
     HAVE to speak up and let your vote be heard.  Apathy will keep
     Policy the way it is now, and your last chance for a voice in
     your own network will be gone.

     Right now, I feel exhausted.  I was asked in the airport if I'd
     "had fun" at FidoCon.  Upon reflection, the answer was "No." It
     was a LOT of hard work, mostly writing and talking to others,
     trying to convince people that this was a worth while effort.
     Many people had given up on IFNA long ago.  Thom Henderson had
     had enough aggravation, so I had to resort to dirty tactics.  I
     reminded him that he'd helped to start IFNA, and that deep down
     he probably cared enough to give FidoNet one more try.  I had to
     convince 6 good people that it was worth the flames and aggrava-
     vation they'd get just to provoke a reaction from others in the
     net (in order to seat a full and active Board).  Make no mistake
     about it, at the friday night Board meeting (after the election
     results were announced), we had enough votes due to absenteeism
     to pretty much do anything we wanted.  But we adjourned until
     Saturday night, primarily so that other alternates for the Board
     could be found.  People's claims of our "taking over" are there-
     fore just plain unfounded.  There was a LOT of convincing to do
     in order to prove to the rest of the Board of our true intent-
     ions. I think we were able to do so, after all, my proposal was
     passed unanimously.  This year's Board Meetings were a prime
     example of what people with opposing viewpoints can accomplish
     when they decide to put their differences aside & work together.

     Speaking of working together, Tom Jennings pointed out that every
     thing we wanted to do was going to take a lot of trust.  The
     Board was going to have to trust the *C's to help carry out the
     vote in a fair manner.  The administrative nodes were going to
     have to trust IFNA to come up with a fair way to produce a work-
     ing policy document.  Matt Whelan, the new IC, promised that the
     *C structure would do everything in its power to get out the
     FidoNews 6-37                Page 11                  11 Sep 1989


     vote.  Based on that trust, IFNA put its corporate structure on
     the line.  If this referendum is not carried, IFNA will be dis-
     solved.  Even if it IS carried out the current Board will be out
     of jobs.  Obviously, I included this point in order to prove our
     intent was founded with the right reasons.

     We accomplished what I'd set out to do, give the sysops of Fido-
     Net one more chance to have a say. In this light, I will be happy
     to tender my resignation as a member of the Board, if the sysops
     of FidoNet feel I should. This whole thing was my idea, and I
     don't want to give even the slightest appearance of impropriety.
     I have appointed Tony Davis from Division 19 as my alternate,
     and he would be taking my seat on the Board.  I've helped to
     give the sysops of FidoNet a chance at a voice in the adminis-
     tration of their own network.

     Well, that's about it.  This is all I have to say on the matter,
     and will not be responding to flames.  Polite requests for infor-
     mation MAY be answered if they come via netmail.  I can't prom-
     ise anything, because I have a feeling I'm going to get swamped.

     The fate of FidoNet is now literally in YOUR hands.  Either make
     your voice heard, or things wil go on the way they are now.

     It's up to YOU now.  The choice is yours.

                 WHAT DO YOU MEAN "FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION?"

     I  sit  here  with  seven months before retirement from the Armed
     Forces of this great nation. Tweenty years for  THIS!,  something
     the U.S. Supreme Court calls "A form of their artistic expression
     or   freedom   of  speech".  I'm  outraged  at  this  freedom  of
     exspression. An expression a Texan would  use  is  "CRAP!"  cause
     that's  what it is. I'm talking about FLAG BURNING. The same flag
     that I used to pledge allegance too. Does  anyone  even  remember
     those days. "One nation for which it stands"...etc.

     I  recall  that  around  1971  there  was  another  law passed to
     prohibit prayer in schools. What replaced  prayer in the halls of
     our school, drugs and drug users. Hey, "you've come  a  long  way
     baby".  As  Merl  would  put  it, "Are we rollin down hill like a
     snowball headed for Hell?" It sure looks that  way  to  me.  They
     took my rights of personal expression away (prayer in school) and
     gave flag burning back to us as a form  of  personal  expression.
     Where  is the logic?...I think they all just sit up there and get
     high.

     I really get concerned when I think these people may be the  same
     people  who  think  their  artistic expression to burn my flag is
     more important than my moral decision to defend it.  Think  about
     it...America  wake  up! Are we really gonna stand by and let them
     force this crap on us? What if someone  says  it's  his  personal
     right  by freedom of expression, to kick MORE dirt in the face of
     a veteran. Isn't that exactly what their saying to us?  Are  they
     gonna punish us for defending the flag on the streets of America?
     We defended it all over the world only to come home to this kinda
     mentality, train of thought (Ha!, that's a good one), etc.

     It's  just a shame that so many of our women and men have died on
     foreign soil protecting that flag, only to  have  our  government
     allow  it  to  be  burned right here on American soil. I want  my
     RIGHT  to  kick the living CRAP outa some jerk that is burning my
     flag.  After all, it's my FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION. Sheesh...see how
     silly that sounds.

     The flag issue has been running hot and heavy  on  Capitol  Hill,
     but members of Congress say it's cooling off now. The chairman of
     the  House Judiciary Subcommittee, who conducted hearings on flag
     burning,  reports  that  more  witnesses   are   leaning   toward
     legislation  rather  than  a  Constitutional amendment. Let's not
     just sit by and watch this sillyness take place. If you  want  to
     see  a  Constitutional  amendment  to prohibit desecration of the
     flag, then write to your elected representatives. Now! before (as
     usual), it's TOO LATE!...Ha...Ha...Ha...they'd just love  you  to
     drag your feet on this one. Rape is next.

     Peter Stern
     65' North
     1:17/38
                  IFNA and the Bigger Picture

     Fidocon 89  was  a very eye opening experience for someone living
     on the "edge  of  the  earth"(  Fairbanks,  Alaska),  out  of the
     mainstream of FidoNet affairs.    Thank  you to Ivan Schaffel for
     letting me carry his proxy at the IFNA BOD meetings.

     I have been a member  of  IFNA since its' inception but like many
     Sysops in Fidonet I began to wonder about the mutation IFNA began
     undergoing.    The publication and distribution of  the  nodelist
     seemed to take a back seat to organizational problems in Zone 1.

     At  Fidocon,  Randy  Bush  chaired  a symposium on  international
     communications.  Listening to the representatives from Zone 2 and
     Zone  3  speak about their problems and hearing the letter  Randy
     read  from  Pablo  Kleinman, Zone 4 ZC, started me thinking about
     Fidonet and IFNA.

     Zone  1 has  become  extremely  enthno-centric  in  handling  the
     development of Fidonet "Policy".    I  think it is widely assumed
     that whatever policy is agreed  to in Zone 1 will fit very nicely
     into the Zones serving the rest  of the world.  This could not be
     farther from the truth.

     The  other  Zones  face  problems  ranging from  $10/min  connect
     charges calling USA, to language barriers, to being  charged  for
     local phone calls, to not having companies willing to  underwrite
     huge phone bills to move echomail.  Netmail runs on  the echomail
     backbone  in  Australia to save money.  Singapore and other parts
     of SE  Asia  can't  afford  the  phone  bills  to  have their own
     Zonegate.

     Fidonet is indeed international in reach and growing more popular
     in an exponential way.    IFNA  should  be the body which fosters
     this growth.  To this  end  I  would propose IFNA be organized to
     accomplish the following tasks:

             1: Membership  in  IFNA  would  be  open   to  ALL  Zones
             operating FTSC compatible mailing systems.  The  ZC  from
             each  member Zone would be on the governing  board.    In
             addition  each    Zone    shall    elect    one  At-large
             representative for a 1 year term on the BOD.

             2:  Protect  the Fidonet copyright forwarded to it by Tom
             Jennings.

             3:  Act as  the clearing house for technical standards by
             continuing the FTSC committees
     FidoNews 6-37                Page 16                  11 Sep 1989


             4:  Work to develop cost effect interzone (international)
             telecommunication links so that high  volume traffic such
             as echomail can be moved at the lowest possible cost.

             5:    Act  as  the voice  for  Fidonet  in  lobbying  for
             legislation  and  standards  acceptance  with governments
             around the  world.    Make sure modems get approval, that
             data  networks  price   themselves  fairly.    Work  with
             telephone  companies  to  ensure   BBS  operators  aren't
             discriminated against due to a  "few"  highly  publicized
             "bad apples" causing trouble with their modems.

             6:  Develop a "model" operational policy for Zones to use
             in  there  operation.    This "model" would  be  a  basic
             structure to be modified by each Zone.   In  this manner,
             differences in countries, telephone pricing systems, echo
             mail distribution, languages,  politics,  geography could
             be accounted for.

             7:  Arrange for  interzone  distribution  of  the Fidonet
             nodelists.  This would mean  Zone  2 and Zone 3 nodelists
             would arrive via IFNA channels to  be  forwarded  to  the
             Zone 1 ZC and vice versa.

             8:    As  much as possible the  IFNA  shall  conduct  its
             business electronically so as not to cause members  undue
             cost in international travel for meetings.

             9:  Annual Dues shall be collected on a  per-capita basis
             from each member Zone at $1 per SysOp.  It  shall  be the
             responsibility  of  each  Zone to figure out how to raise
             membership dues  from  its  member  SysOps.  Dues will be
             used to support lobbying efforts, Zonegate operations and
             nodelist distribution.

             10:    IFNA  shall   NOT  be  involved  in  the  internal
             operations of any of its member Zones.

             11:  Problems involving interzone communications shall be
             within the purview of IFNA to affect resolution.

     So basically IFNA would get out  of  Zone  1  affairs  and  begin
     taking  a look at the "bigger picture".    Fidonet  needs  to  be
     thinking on a worldwide scale.  A new Zone will be coming on line
     soon  in  Africa  and  there  is  rumor that a  node  will  begin
     operations in Moscow.  We cannot afford to cripple the  future of
     Fidonet  simply  because  Zone 1 can't agree on how it should  be
     operated.

     Tom Jennings' idea  of  linking BBSs showed incredible foresight.
     Lets take it further  and  ensure  it becomes worldwide in scope.
     Fidonet needs to step beyond its Zone 1 origins and realize there
     is a world out there with  different  problems and values yet the
     same  desires to be able to telecommunicate  in  a  reliable  and
     inexpensive manner.

                     Distribution of KidsNews Changes

     School  has  started  again, I don't where the summer goes? I and
     many of you are back to the "Old  grind"  of  classes,  teachers,
     homework,   etc...  and  this  makes  for  some  difficulties  in
     maintaining our summer activities through the school  year.  With
     this  in  mind,  I'd like to announce that KidsNews will slow its
     distribution back down to ONCE PER MONTH.

     This is necessary because a lot of you cannot make  the  time  to
     submit items for publication in KidsNews. I also don't think that
     the  teachers  are  really aware that KidsNews could be used as a
     class project for students. If teachers do become aware  of  this
     fact  and  I  see  some  interest generated, then I can bring the
     distribution back to once per week (Don't  hold  your  breath  on
     that one).

     I  want  to  thank those that have contributed through the summer
     months. You really had  some  interesting  ideas  and  activities
     going  through the summer. I exspecially like the idea of getting
     the KIDS echo linked into Russia. If you guys pull that off,  you
     will  have really made some progress for FidoNet, America and the
     world.

     Thanks goes to my Dad for  the  link  to  the  Computer  Learning
     Foundation  and  the  activities  occuring there. I got a feeling
     this project will be one that will last for a long time to  come.
     Also,  National Computer Learning Month (NCLM), which is starting
     in October proves to be of great benefit to  students,  teachers,
     parents,  individuals,  etc.  I  mean  if  you  can win an entire
     computer system just by answering a few questions, then  why  not
     take  that  little  bit  of time there. Now that would be a great
     school project for some really sharp teacher. Winning himself and
     his school  a  name  brand  computer  just  by  taking  a  SLIGHT
     interest  and  talking with my Dad or writing to us at: NCLM Echo
     Conference, P.O. Box 8045, Granite City,  IL  62040-8045.  Now  I
     have pointed the way, you just need to ACT!!!!!! and NOW!!!!

     If  there are a few out there that are not receiving KidsNews and
     would like to get it on a regular basis,  please  have  your  Net
     Coordinator  (NC)  contact  us  at 288/525 to pull it in for your
     net. Dad said he would be happy to shoot it to the NC's  if  they
     accept continuos mail (CM). Is that like opening the door to your
     mail  box  and  letters start flying out and you get snowed under
     and can't get out? Interesting concept...

     Well, I gotta go do homework (Yuck), ya'll write me sometime. I'm
     in the book. I guess it's a book? actually it's not a book unless
     you print it out. Then I could be wrong. At  any  rate,  give  me
     some  articles  and  I'll get them out. Hope your school days are
     full of new friends and MORE COMPUTERS!

                   "THOSE WHO LIVE IN GLASS HOUSES...."
                        (By  Bob Moravsik 269/107)

     Over the  past  few weeks you have had to endure certain articles
     by Mr.  Phil Buonomo (107/583.0) complaining about tactics of the
     *C structure.  Then  the  members of "DEATHNET" as Mr.  Whelan so
     artfully puts it, takes over  the  majority  of  the  board seats
     elects "the boys" as officiers and  give  the members its our way
     or IFNA is DEAD choice.

     What he has left out is the  tactics HE and his NC, Fabian Gordon
     IFNA VP and BOD tried to pull on  me, just for participating in a
     heated dispute over groupmail in a local net echo.   There was no
     warning,  I  did  not get any chance to reply to  the  NET  LEVEL
     complain.   It's a good thing we have an RC and  a  ZC  that  are
     fair.   Mr.   Buonomo complains about the very tactics he himself
     has no trouble  using.    I  have  stood  by  and  read Buonomo's
     articles which just attempts to discredit others.

     I cannot standby any  longer.    Note  Mr.    Buonomo was given a
     chance to reply well before  this  was  published.   I originally
     wanted this article to be published in the earlier FIDONEWS but I
     missed a few "specs".  Here is  the  story, AND heed well.  These
     tactics  will  be repeated in my opinion in  the  future  against
     people who want FIDONET and IFNA to be the true representative of
     this  hobby instead of the control thereof.  GUYS and  GIRLS  the
     name of the game with the present "group" is control.   Hopefully
     the  majority of us will change that.  Maybe a new WORLD  FIDONET
     ASSOCIATION is NEEDED.  Call it WFA or Woof !!!!


     This  is a public statement of a policy contoversy which has been
     in existance  since  May 1989.  Many nodes only have seen part of
     the "facts".  Here is the full story.

     The information was  sent  to  Mr.    Buonomo  on 7/15/89 for his
     comment  and  to  be  sure  any  possible  inaccuracies  (in  Mr.
     Buonomo's opinion) are corrected.

     Mr. Buonomo responds as follows:   [No reponse]

     By secret complaint POL91063 dated  early  in  May  Mr.   Buonomo
     attempted  with  Mr.    Gordon  to  excommunicate  Moravsik  from
     FIDONET.  Mr.  Buonomo did a bombing run on net 107 attempting to
     get  signatures  on  a  "petition" (only a few  were  gotten  and
     Buonomo refused to supply the names for varification) Some of the
     evidence  submitted was dated AFTER the complaint and "tacked" on
     to the decision which was already made.  There was no opportunity
     for  Moravsik to respond to the complaint.  In fact there was  no
     knowledge it  was  pending.    A  KANGAROO  COURT IN IT BEST FORM
     !!!!!!!

     FidoNews 6-37                Page 21                  11 Sep 1989


     Mr.  Gordon's decision found Moravsik to be excessivelly annoying
     for  participating  in  a  debate  in  REGION  13  and  METRONET.
     Moravsik was to be excommunicated.   At the time the nodes in net
     107 HUB 800 were forming Net 269.  !!!!


     The matter was appealed to the  RC  by  a  brief submitted by Mr.
     Moravsik.  Mr Buonomo filed no response,  other  then  a  message
     telling  Moravsik  that  he never knew how stupid  Moravsik  was.
     [text will be supplied if requested]


     The decision of the RC, Mr. Peace was a follows:


     "I have received POL91063 (complaint) and APP90163 (appeal).   My
     DECISION is in favor of Mr.  Moravsik's APPEAL.  The complaint is
     reversed.

     Inconsistencies and improprieties  in the complaint were apparent
     to me as soon as I began reviewing it...

       - a considerable portion of  the evidence presented quotes only
         one  side  of  dialogues  from  the  METRONET  and   REGION13
         conferences.    Having  been  a  participant in one of  those
         conferences  (REGION13)  I  found  both  Mr.  Buonomo and Mr.
         Moravsik to  be engaged in a verbal battle in that conference
         that  was intense  and  sometimes  annoying  to  me  but  not
         excessively annoying.  The Moravsik messages, when quoted out
         of "thread" certainly do appear  to  justify  Mr.   Buonomo's
         allegations.  But what is quoted  in  the complaint is little
         better than recording only one side of  a conversation.  As I
         said,  I  was  a participant in the REGION13  conference  and
         witnessed  the  full  series of exchanges in that conference.
         The situation is without fault.

       - Mr.    Gordon  is moderator of METRONET.  I am  moderator  of
         REGION13.  Neither R13EC nor I have seen a complaint filed by
         the moderator  of  either  conference  asking  for any action
         against Mr.   Moravsik.  If a complaint had been filed by the
         recognized moderator of either  conference,  the  only remedy
         would  have  been  banishment of  Mr.    Moravsik  from  that
         conference.  If Mr.  Moravsik  had  been  banned  from either
         conference and continued to enter messages he would then (and
         only  then)  be  subject  to  an excessively annoying  policy
         complaint.

       - Mr.    Gordon's justifications included reference to a "straw
         vote".  He  suggests  that  "most  of  the  other members" of
         FidoNet Net 107 were polled and that "96% of the vote" was in
         favor of removal of Mr.  Moravsik.  Other evidence I received
     FidoNews 6-37                Page 22                  11 Sep 1989


         suggests  this  "straw  vote"  aka  "Bob  Moravsik  Petition"
         occurred after May 2.  This is the first time I have heard of
         a  vote  being  taken among FidoNet sysops for  inclusion  or
         exclusion  of  another  FidoNet sysop.  The presence of  this
         vote  as  part  of  Mr.  Gordon's justification suggests that
         membership in  FidoNet net 107 might be based on a popularity
         contest.  The  practice is in my opinion Excessively Annoying
         in and of itself.

       - Mr.  Buonomo's complaint  was  dated  "May  1, 1989".  It was
         recorded as received by Mr.  Gordon on  "May  2,  1989".   In
         reading  said  complaint, I find it inexcusable that material
         quoted in item 10 in support of the May 1  complaint is dated
         "Fri 12 May 89 9:39".


     To Messrs. Buonomo and Gordon:

     Your  actions in the filing and approval of complaint #91063 have
     wasted a  considerable amount of Mr.  Moravsik's time in offering
     his defense.   I  see  the  complaint as an attempt to railroad a
     FidoNet sysop out of  the network using methods I cannot condone.
     Unfortunately, whether or not Mr.   Moravsik has been annoying is
     no longer an issue.

     To: Mr. Gordon:

     Mr.  Moravsik's FidoNet node number  (1:107/853)  is  *NOT* to be
     removed from the Net 107 nodelist submission  until  such time as
     all members of the newly formed net 269 are removed from net 107.
     As agreed by telephone on May 12, that date  will  be  four weeks
     after net 269 appears in the FidoNet Nodelist.

     If Mr.  Buonomo chooses to appeal my decision to  the  ZC  and if
     the  ZC  overturns  that decision you will retain Mr.  Moravsik's
     FidoNet node  number  in net 107 only until your first submission
     following that decision (in Mr.  Buonomo's favor).

      George Peace
      FidoNet Region 13 Coordinator
      May 16, 1989 "


     This action was then appealed to the ZC Mr Dodell by Mr.  Buonomo
     No brief was submitted  by  Mr.  Moravsik as the appeal submitted
     by Buonomo was "secret" ie  no  copy  was provided to Moravsik to
     answer.  The decision of the ZC was:


      "Phil, I see no reason to overturn the decision of George Peace,
      RC13 in your appeal of a policy complaint against Bob Moscovich.

     FidoNews 6-37                Page 23                  11 Sep 1989


      Since  this appears to me as nothing  more  then  a  personality
      conflict,  I will trust the RC who is  more  familiar  with  the
      personalities  involved  to  make the right decision." [By David
      Dodell]



     Then  Mr.    Buonomo  attempts  to  appeal  again  to  the   Zone
     Coordinators  by passing on message to the ZC BUT telling him  he
     cannot take part in the decision.  Although Mr.  Buonomo has gone
     on record  and  stated that POLICY 4 is illegal HE NOW USES IT to
     APPEAL !!!!!!!   Mr.    Moravsik  would have filed a response and
     would argue to reject  the  appeal, uphold the findings of the RC
     that Buonomo was EXCESSIVELY ANNOYING and EXCOMUNICATE HIM.

     The Official Public Computer Nodelist Concept Revisited

                      by Jim Grubs, Publisher

     The original concept of the Official Public Computer Nodelist was
     a  good  one. The idea, to refresh your memory,  was  that  there
     should be a simple, unified nodelist with everyone who wanted his
     Fidonet  compatible  mailer listed without any of  the  political
     bickering that seems to have become the favorite American  indoor
     sport for network sysops. (Well, next to favorite anyway.)

     Well,  a funny thing happened on the way to Utopia. The  original
     OPCNLIST  managers grew impatient, apparently, and abandoned  the
     idea  of waiting for sysops to ask to be unlisted. Instead,  they
     put  EVERYONE in Fidonet and a couple others into OPCNLIST.  This
     forced people who did not want to be in it, for any reason or for
     no  reason,  to insist on being removed. The resulting  storm  of
     protest  grew quite NASTY and even included all sorts of  threats
     of legal action and litigation.

     George Kasica, who was producing the OPCNLIST for its originator,
     decided he wanted no part of that nonsense and quit. He announced
     he would no longer produce the OPCNLIST and asked for a volunteer
     to  take  over.  He  listed a  file  for  file  requesting  which
     contained all sorts of fascinating programs, source files,  batch
     files, etc., for producing the OPCNLIST with Ben Baker's MakeNL.

     I  responded immediately by netmail stating that I would pick  up
     the  flag  he was dropping and and requested him  to  delete  the
     OPCN.ZIP  which  I had file requested. He did  delete  that  file
     without  comment or reservation, which I consider  to  constitute
     the  legal  offer  tendered  and  accepted  required  to  make  a
     contract.

     I  immediately,  as  an  effort to put  out  the  fire  storm  of
     protests, created OPCNLIST.251 and OPCNDIFF.251 in such a fashion
     as  to  erase EVERYONE from it except Fidonet 234, whose  NC  had
     earlier told me it was OK for me to submit the net roster to  the
     original OPCNLIST, and Alternet 448, which I am in the process of
     organizing.  In  the future only those nets and  nodes  who agree
     in advance will be listed, which was the original intention.

     OPCNLIST.251 includes the following prologue:

         "This   is  the  OPCNLIST,  copyright  1989.  It  is   a
         compilation of copyrighted information supplied to it by
         the  original  copyright  owners. To the  best  off  our
         knowledge, this information is accurate and is used with
         the full knowledge and consent of the person or  persons
         authorized  to give that consent. If this turns out  not
         to  be  the  case, we apologize  and  will  correct  the
     FidoNews 6-37                Page 25                  11 Sep 1989


         mistake as soon as it is called to our attention. We are
         not  trying  to  pull any flimflam, so  if  there  IS  a
         mistake,  it  is NOT necessary to scream  and  yell  and
         carry on like a nut.  Contrary to the policy of previous
         managers of the OPCNLIST, we don't want anyone in it who
         does not ask to be in it. On the other hand, anyone  who
         asks  to be in it WILL be in it without regard  to  what
         anyone else may say about it.

         "This  compiled OPCNLIST is itself copyrighted,  but  it
         may be used freely by anyone. It is copyrighted only  so
         that  we may reserve the right to forbid its  commercial
         sale  or  use. This a hobby not a business  and  I  hope
         therefore  nobody  is going  to  get  disproportionately
         litigious about it.

         "All data flags are as supplied to us. If it breaks your
         machine, don't yell at us; yell at those who sent it  to
         us. I respectfully request everyone to stick to the IFNA
         nodelist flag standards at least for the present.

        "The  OPCNLIST is produced as the nodelist of 'Zone  11'.
        This is done for reasons of technical convenience and  no
        other significance should be attached to it."


     Well,  troops,  that's  the  scoop.  If  you  want  your  net  or
     independent node listed in OPCNLIST, send a copy of your  regular
     MakeNL  submission  file, including a prologue  and/or  copyright
     notice containing explicit, specific permission for us to use  it
     to  the OPCNLIST Distribution Hub, Donn Bly, 1:236/7,  77:1011/7,
     11:11/7.

     You  have  my  word.  This is going to  stick  to  the  original,
     apolitical concept. Think of it as a "generic" nodelist,  similar
     to the Darwin list except it's for Fidonet compatible mailers. We
     don't  care what you say to one another. We don't care  who  gets
     echomail  from whom. We don't care how mean, nasty, and  annoying
     you  are  to  one  another. All we cre  about  is  pubishing  the
     nodelist  to do it with every Friday at 6:00 AM, ET. The rest  is
     your business, not ours.

     Wish me luck, and don't forget to vote in the IFNA Referendum.

     Date:   20 Aug 89 21:51:15
     From:   Pablo Kleinman of 4:1200/101

     A Message from Pablo Kleinman, FidoNet Zone Coordinator  in Latin
     America to FidoCon:

     It would have been very nice and interesting, to be here with you
     today and get  to know all of you in person.  But it could not be
     possible  for  me  to  leave  the  country  right  now.    I  was
     tremendously interested in coming to  FidoCon, but my obligations
     didn't allow it.  And with the terrible economic situation we are
     experiencing, it is far too expensive to  go  anywhere across the
     border.

     Would  it  be  possible to organize FidoCon for July  instead  of
     August?  Being August one of the busiest months in  the  year  in
     South  America,  we are usually unable to suspend our obligations
     to travel overseas.

     Through this  brief  passages, I would like to tell you about our
     existance in the net, and what is currently FidoNet Zone 4.

     FidoNet  Latin America  was  established  on  May  of  1987,  and
     officially incorporated on September of that same year.

     At the beginning we  were  given  a  net  (I  remember it was net
     number 368) on Region 18,  whose  RC at that time was Christopher
     Baker.

     But nodes added up, and I  had  to  start  "making  wonders".  No
     doubt it was kind of strange to  assign  a  Hub  number  for each
     Country!

     It  took  us  almost  two  years to have  our  own  Zone  up  and
     running...  We were so glad when David Dodell  offered  us  to be
     Zone 4 back in April!

     We grew many times, yes, but I'm sure there is no place with more
     problems to set up FidoNet nodes than in Latin America.

     To   start,  we  have  in  most  of  the  countries,  State-owned
     monopolies that  run  the  whole  telephonic system, "as worst as
     possible", and many times "as more expensive as possible".

     Just to give  you  an  idea, before the Argentinean phone company
     started an expansion project a few years ago, you could request a
     phone line and wait as  much as THIRTY years to get it installed!
     Of course, with the new expansion  program,  you  must pay around
     two thousand dollars and wait maybe three years to get it.

     As a result of the shortage of  phone  lines, we don't have nodes
     running  24  hours  a day in Zone 4;    most  of  the  nodes  are
     installed in the sysops offices and houses' phone lines.

     FidoNews 6-37                Page 27                  11 Sep 1989


     In this two years of FidoNetting, we were not  able  to  get  any
     help from any public or private enterprise;  we are still somehow
     isolated from the rest of the net.  A minute of IDD to the United
     States  can  cost  the  same  as  dining  out,  no  wonder  it is
     expensive!

     Looking to solve  our  financial  disabilities,  we are trying to
     develop a way to transfer the mail packets to other zones through
     Packet radio.

     Fortunately, some people out there  that  care  for us, and while
     the zonegate is financed by Dick  Gladden  of El Paso (Texas) and
     Randy  Bush  of  Portland  (Oregon), our two  only  international
     echomail  conferences:  RedLatina and Twger.link are financed  by
     Juan Davila of Puerto Rico, and Bor-Long Lin of Taiwan.

     We  faced,  are facing and still will face many  difficulties  to
     keep  running  and expand FidoNet on the Southwestern hemisphere.
     We need your care, your help, your assistance.

     We established  some  months  ago,  the  Latin  American  FidoNet
     Association, and on  August  4,  NotiFido,  the  Spanish-language
     FidoNews, was edited for the first time.

     Some local programmers have  developed  some  utilities,  that we
     intend to make available to all of you in short.

     Please, try to keep in  touch  with us, we need your help to keep
     this project running.

     My best regards to all of  you, today reunited in FidoCon, and in
     the name of all the Zone 4  sysops, thank you for sharing with us
     this huge network of enthusiasts and hobbyists.  Of people around
     the world with a great desire for communicating.
