     On any given day, at any given moment, the phone at the water and
     sewage department can ring with a crisis call.

     Southeast Treatment Plant, this is Zack.

     "Ahem, err, why are ... uhhh are you adding ... uhhhmmm, why are
     you putting ammonia in our drinking water ...?"

     Pardon me?

     "Uhhh, in my drinking water ... in my fish-tank ..."

     You drink the water from your fish-tank?

     "Uhhhh, errr, nooooo, I uh ..."

     Sir, we have a terrible connection, sounds like you're talking
     into a garbage can ...

     "Hold on a sec ...  THERE!  IS THAT BETTER?  I WAS ON MY NEW
     SPEAKER PHONE!"

     What else are you on?

     "'SCUSE ME?"

     Never mind.  Don't shout, I can hear ya fine now.  You said your
     fish-tank tastes funny?

     "Uhhhh, nooooo.  All my fish died so I tested the water and it
     has ammonia in it."

     What's your point?

     "The water in my fish-tank came from our faucet ... it's regular
     drinking water from you.  Your ammonia killed my fish!"

     We don't add ammonia to our water.  Some of the large systems do,
     to form chloramines so they can carry a chlorine residual for
     great distances, but we don't do that.

     "Now wait a minute!  I tested the water, both in the fish tank
     and from the faucet and it has ammonia in it!"

     I see.  How much ammonia?.
     FidoNews 4-26                Page 2                   13 Jul 1987


     "Five."

     Five ...?  Five what?  Five parts per million, parts per billion,
     parts per trillion...?

     "Uhhhhh, it just says five."

     What kind of equipment are you using?

     "Well, I dunno but it cost me PLENTY!  I spent $12 on it to find
     out YOU killed my fish!  It has test tubes and a color chart!  I
     went to college, you know!"

     Uh huh, I'm sure your mother is proud.  Look, friend, let me
     assure you our lab, as well as the EPA lab, cost a tad more than
     $12.  Both labs are certified for technique and accuracy and
     their results show the drinking water has barely enough ammonia
     to measure.

     "You mean I wasted $12?"

     Looks that way.

     "But my fish are all dead! The tank even smells like ammonia!"

     How big was the tank and how many fish were in it?

     "It was a 10 gallon tank and I had 50 black mollies in it."

     Wonderful.  You had 50 fish in a 10 gallon tank?

     "Sure!  The book that came with the tank said ..."

     Whoa!  Listen, ammonia may have played a part in bumping your
     fish off but the ammonia came from their own waste.

     "Their own waste? I don't understand!"

     Waste ... excrement ... in college terms, your fish made wee wee
     in the water...

     "Oooooh......."

     ... and they made big poo poo ...

     "Ahhhh, but my filter removes all that!"

     Right.  When was the last time you cleaned your filter?

     "Why, NEVER!  This filter turns the waste into air by rotifer
     reaction so it never needs cleaning.  It worked fine for a
     month!"

     Sir, have you ever considered changing hobbies to something other
     than tropical fish?

     "Well, I USED to raise tropical plants until YOUR water killed
     them!"

     How often did you water them?

     "At least four times a day ..."

     Maybe you'd consider raising hydroponic pet rocks.

     "C L I C K ! ! "

     Sometimes it doesn't pay to be helpful ...

                        2400 Baud At The Right Price


     Recently I was looking for a new 2400 baud modem and  decided  to
     look around a bit.  After seeing the prices on Hayes and Courier,
     I knew I had to go with a clone if I wanted  2400  baud  at  this
     time!

     After  searching  around  I  found the MAXUM 2400 baud modem at a
     very reasonable $199.95 from a rather large discount store in the
     area. (47th Street Photo)

     So, I plunked down the green and took this little joy home to see
     if I had been ripped off or not. To my surprise, it turned out to
     be a rather good purchase!

     It claimed to be Hayes compatible,  but many of us have seen that
     before,  and  I  for  one  was a little wary.  But I was wrong to
     worry!  I opened the box,  plugged it in,  and set Opus for Hayes
     2400  and  away we went.  Both Opus and SEAdog recognized it as a
     Hayes 2400,  and all the command sequences built into both pieces
     of software work fine with it!

     I  have  tested  it  now with both normal communications and file
     transfers with all the popular protocols,  and have not found any
     increase in errors over 1200 baud transfers. But of course, it is
     much  quicker,  especially  when  you  use  the  SEAlink transfer
     protocol and even faster when using some of the newer protocols.

     In all fairness,  there was one problem that I could not solve by
     normal  methods.  For  some  unexplained  reason,  no matter what
     command sequence I fed it,  I could not shut off the speaker,  or
     lower the volume.  Unlike most other external modems, there is no
     outside volume control.  So a quick call to the dealer who was as
     stumped as I was.

     Being handy with tools, the speaker is now shut off!

     All  in  all,  a  very  good  purchase for someone looking for an
     inexpensive 2400 baud external modem.

                            TALKING ASSEMBLER 3
                               by Ned Sturzer
                           Chattanooga, Tennessee
                               OpusNODE 362/1

      The machine instructions are the soul of Assembler and  we  will
     examine  them  in  great  detail.  Each  instruction may have two
     operands,  one operand,  or even no operands.  Most  instructions
     refer  to  memory  locations,   registers,   port  addresses,  or
     immediate data.  The manner in which these locations are referred
     to  are  known  as addressing modes.  Some instructions allow for
     implied operands and the operand is not indicated.  For  example,
     the instruction

                                    cbw

     takes  the  high-order bit in the AL register and places the same
     value in all the bits of AH.  In effect,  cbw extends the sign of
     AL  to  AH.  In  this instruction the operands are in the implied
     addressing mode.

      Immediate data is allowed in the operands of  many  instructions
     as in

                    int 9    or in     mov pointer,417H

     where  pointer is a label for a memory address.  In direct memory
     addressing the operand is in the form

                              segment:offset

     an example being

                             test di,ss:4ee7H

     Based operands refer to the memory location computed by adding  a
     displacement,  disp,  to  the value in DS:BX,  CS:BX,  SS:BX,  or
     ES:BX. You may also use DS:BP, CS:BP, SS:BP, or ES:BP.  DS:BX may
     be written simply as BX,  while SS:BP may be expressed as BP.  If
     the displacement resolves to 0 it is  not  written.  Among  valid
     ways of writing based operands are

                                 disp.[BX]
                               ES:[BP]+disp
                                [disp][BX]

     Now consider the instruction xchg [bx-3],di where bx contains the
     value a06b.  Our instruction will exchange the contents of the di
     register with whatever value  is  in  the  two  bytes  of  memory
     ds:a069  and  ds:a06a.  If  the  displacement is 0 it need not be
     indicated.

     Indexed operands are treated similarly to based  operands  except
     the  si  and  di  registers  are  used.  With either si or di the
     default segment register is ds.  An exception to this is that  if
     di  is used in string instructions such as stos or lodsw then the
     FidoNews 4-26                Page 6                   13 Jul 1987


     default segment register used with di is  es.  In  this  case  es
     cannot be overriden.

     Based indexed operands use a displacement in conjunction with one
     register  from either bp or bx and one register from either si or
     di. As you would expect by now the default segment register if bp
     used is ss and otherwise the default segment register is ds. Also
     if based indexed operands are used in string instructions then di
     forces the segment register to be es. As an illustration consider
     the instruction

                      cmp byte ptr es:[bp+6][di],0feH

     where es:bp has the value  b800:0147  and  ds:di  has  the  value
     0000:0200.  This  instruction  then  compares the contents of the
     memory location b800:034d with fe.

     If based indexed operands seem complicated - they  are.  However,
     they  allow you to do some fancy footwork through memory.  Before
     moving on to examine the individual instructions I need to tie up
     a loose end.  Whenever register IP is used to refer to  a  memory
     location the reference is always to location cs:ip.  Similarly if
     register SP is used to refer to  memory  the  location  ss:sp  is
     intended.

     I'll  group  the  machine  op  codes according to their function,
     indicate the flags affected after  the  operation  is  performed,
     give the nature and size of the operands, and give examples.

                           I. Logical Operators

     The  logical  operators  AND,  NOT,  OR,  and  XOR (exclusive or)
     perform the bit-by-bit logical operations their names imply.  The
     result  is  stored  in  the first operand.  They are used to gain
     access to the individual bits of a byte or word.

     A. AND ax/al,immed
                  Flags:C=0, P, A=?, Z, S, O=0
     B. AND r/m,immed
                  8 or 16 bits
                  Flags:C=0, P, A=?, Z, S, O=0
     C. AND r,r
                  8 or 16 bits
                  Flags:C=0, P, A=?, Z, S, O=0
     D. AND m,r
                  8 or 16 bits
                  Flags:C=0, P, A=?, Z, S, O=0
     E. AND r,m
                  8 or 16 bits
                  Flags:C=0, P, A=?, Z, S, O=0

     To explain the shorthand I'll use:  In the operand area r is  any
     register other than a segment register, m is any memory location,
     and  immed stands for immediate data.  Should a specific register
     be used it will be indicated as in form A.  If the  size  of  the
     operands  (8  or  16  bits)  is  not  implied  by the form of the
     FidoNews 4-26                Page 7                   13 Jul 1987


     instruction I have  indicated  it.  The  flags  are  affected  as
     indicated where =? means the flag may be changed arbitrarily.

     Consider AND al,01101000B where ax contains 01000011B.  After the
     instruction is performed al will  contain  01000000B,  C=0,  P=0,
     Z=0,  S=0, O=0, and A is arbitrary.  Form A is distinguished from
     form B since it requires one less byte in  memory  to  store  the
     instruction.  AND  is  used  to  clear  specific  bits to 0 while
     keeping the other bits intact.

     F. NOT r/m
                  8 or 16 bits
                  Flags: none

     NOT simply interchanges all the bits of the operand.  Thus in NOT
     word  ptr  [bp+di]  if  bp  contains 0050,  di contains 0017,  ss
     contains 0040,  and 0040:0067 to 0040:0068 contain the word a51c,
     then  after the operation this word will contain 5ae3.  Note that
     it  is  here  necessary  to  tell  the  Assembler  that  we   are
     considering  a  word  since  there  is nothing in the instruction
     which otherwise indicates the length of the operand.

     G. OR ax/al,immed
                  Flags:C=0, P, A=?, Z, S, O=0
     H. OR r/m,immed
                  8 or 16 bits
                  Flags:C=0, P, A=?, Z, S, O=0
     I. OR r,r
                  8 or 16 bits
                  Flags:C=0, P, A=?, Z, S, O=0
     J. OR m,r
                  8 or 16 bits
                  Flags:C=0, P, A=?, Z, S, O=0
     K. OR r,m
                  8 or 16 bits
                  Flags:C=0, P, A=?, Z, S, O=0
     L. XOR ax/al,immed
                  Flags:C=0, P, A=?, Z, S, O=0
     M. XOR r/m,immed
                  8 or 16 bits
                  Flags:C=0, P, A=?, Z, S, O=0
     N. XOR r,r
                  8 or 16 bits
                  Flags:C=0, P, A=?, Z, S, O=0
     O. XOR m,r
                  8 or 16 bits
                  Flags:C=0, P, A=?, Z, S, O=0
     P. XOR r,m
                  8 or 16 bits
                  Flags:C=0, P, A=?, Z, S, O=0

     The OR instruction allows you to set specific bits to 1 while the
     other bits are unchanged.  XOR is used to reverse  specific  bits
     keeping  the  others  as  they  were.  Also  the  XOR instruction
     provides an  efficient  way  of  setting  a  register  or  memory
     location to 0. For example XOR bx,bx sets bx to 0.

     II. Other Bit Manipulators

     The  TEST  instruction  and the various shift and rotate commands
     are akin to  to  logical  operators  in  that  they  perform  bit
     manipulation.

     A. TEST ax/al,immed
                  Flags:C=0, P, A=?, Z, S, O=0
     B. TEST r/m,immed
                  8 or 16 bits
                  Flags:C=0, P, A=?, Z, S, O=0
     C. TEST r,r
                  8 or 16 bits
                  Flags:C=0, P, A=?, Z, S, O=0
     D. TEST m,r
                  8 or 16 bits
                  Flags:C=0, P, A=?, Z, S, O=0
     E. TEST r,m
                  8 or 16 bits
                  Flags:C=0, P, A=?, Z, S, O=0

     TEST  is  similar  to AND in that it performs an AND but does not
     alter either operand.  Only the flags are adjusted.  TEST may  be
     used to determine the bit settings of specific bits.

     F. SHL r/m,1
                  8 or 16 bits
                  Flags:C, O
     G. SHL r/m,cl
                  8 or 16 bits
                  Flags:C, O

     The  SHL  command shifts the contents of the first operand either
     one bit left or by  the  number  of  bits  indicated  in  the  cl
     register.  The  low  order  bits  vacated  by  this operation are
     replaced by zeros.  Should cl contain a  value  greater  than  or
     equal  to  the  length of the first operand then the operand will
     become 0.  As long as no ones  bits  are  shifted  out  then  SHL
     multiplies by powers of two. For example,

                           mov cl,3
                           shl byte ptr ds:0143

     multiplies  the  contents  of the byte at ds:0143 by 8 if ds:0143
     originally has zeros in its high order three bits.  Be aware that
     the  Macro  Assembler,  MASM,  accepts  the  mnemonic  SAL  which
     performs the same function as SHL. Oddly, SYMDEB and DEBUG do not
     recognize SAL in the -a command.  The convention used by the 8088
     chip is that if an integer is regarded as signed  then  the  high
     order  bit is the sign bit.  A 1 in the sign bit means a negative
     number and a 0 means a positive number.  With this in mind we can
     understand  the  rules  used  to  set  the flag bits in shift and
     rotate operations.  The carry flag is set to the last bit  pushed
     out of the end of the operand.  The overflow flag is undefined if
     the second operand is a cl and cl has a value other  than  1.  if
     the  second  operand is 1 or if it is cl with a value of 1,  then
     FidoNews 4-26                Page 9                   13 Jul 1987


     the overflow flag is set to 1 if the sign bit changes.  Otherwise
     the overflow flag is cleared to 0.

     H. SHR r/m,1
                  8 or 16 bits
                  Flags:C, O
     I. SHR r/m,cl
                  8 or 16 bits
                  Flags:C, O

     This is a shift right with the vacated bits  replaced  by  zeros.
     SHR acts as an integer divide by powers of two as long as no ones
     bits are shifted out.

     J. SAR r/m,1
                  8 or 16 bits
                  Flags:C, P, A=?, Z, S, O
     K. SAR r/m,cl
                  8 or 16 bits
                  Flags:C, P, A=?, Z, S, O

     This  is  an  arithmetic  shift right instruction which functions
     similarly to SHR.  The difference,  besides  the  effect  on  the
     flags, is that the vacated bits are filled by the sign bit.  Thus
     the result of the sequence

                                 mov al,8f
                                 mov cl,3
                                 sar al,cl

     is that al will contain f1.

     L. ROL r/m,1
                  8 or 16 bits
                  Flags:C, O
     M. ROL r/m,cl
                  8 or 16 bits
                  Flags:C, O

     This rotate left instruction acts like  the  SHL  command  except
     that  the  value  in  the  high  order  bit  of the first operand
     replaces the value vacated in bit 0.  Therefore if dh contains 7e
     and cl contains 2 then ROL dh,cl will leave dh with f9.

     N. ROR r/m,1
                  8 or 16 bits
                  Flags:C, O
     O. ROR r/m,cl
                  8 or 16 bits
                  Flags:C, O

     The  rotate right instruction,  ROR,  is the analog of ROL except
     that the value in bit 0 replaces the value vacated  in  the  high
     order bit of the first operand.

     P. RCR r/m,1
     FidoNews 4-26                Page 10                  13 Jul 1987


                  8 or 16 bits
                  Flags:C, O
     Q. RCR r/m,cl
                  8 or 16 bits
                  Flags:C, O

     Rotate right through carry,  RCR,  is similar to ROR but here the
     value in bit 0 is placed in the carry flag and the value  in  the
     carry flag is placed in the high order bit of the first operand.

     R. RCL r/m,1
                  8 or 16 bits
                  Flags:C, O
     S. RCL r/m,cl
                  8 or 16 bits
                  Flags:C, O

     RCL is the left rotating version of RCR.

             THE DIRTY DOZEN -- An Uploaded Program Alert List
                     Issue #7 Compiled by Eric Newhouse


      Recently,  many unlawfully  copied  or  modified  programs  have
     appeared  on  various  IBM PC bulletin boards across the country.
     THE DIRTY DOZEN is a list of known examples.

      There are four major  categories  of  bad  software:  commercial
     pirate jobs, unauthorized copies of otherwise legitimate freeware
     programs,  malicious  "TROJAN" programs which damage your system,
     and  miscellaneous  illegal  software.   Please   look   in   the
     definitions   section  of  this  document  for  a  more  detailed
     explanation of these terms.

      SysOps:  Please be careful with  the  files  you  post  in  your
     download  libraries!  An  professional  quality  uploaded game or
     disk utility should arouse  your  suspicions,  especially  if  it
     doesn't  include  the  author's name,  address,  and distribution
     policy.  Such programs are probably NOT public  domain!  The  BBS
     community  is  already  under legislative threat at the State and
     Federal level.  We cannot fight this trend effectively while  our
     directories  sit  stocked  with  cracked  Sega  games,   wargames
     dialers,  and malicious  "trojan  horses!"  Let's  demonstrate  a
     little   social   responsibility  by  cleaning  up  our  download
     libraries.

     If you as a SysOp have any of these files on your system,  please
     delete them and post "blocking" dummy file entries like this one:


             ZAXXON.COM        DELETED!! NOT PUBLIC DOMAIN!!


      If  everyone works together to fight this new brand of software,
     the growing numbers of piraters and trojan horse writers may well
     be put 'out of business!'

      The idea behind THE DIRTY DOZEN is to bring this important issue
     to the attention of  more  SysOps  and  users  -  to  act  as  an
     information  "clearing  -house"  for the latest known examples of
     "bogusware," so that an educated public can fight effectively for
     safe downloadable files.

       The Dirty Dozen is a big project,  and it needs  your  help  to
     succeed!  Please  call  in  any  updates of bad software that you
     know of,  but DO NOT modify this article  yourself.  If  everyone
     who  discovers  a pirated program starts modifying the DD,  there
     would be hundreds of issues in circulation.

       Also,  I think it's quite unfair,  especially considering  that
     I've spent over a hundred hours of my time on this list, for just
     anyone to put their name at the top of the list and say that they
     write,  or  helped  write,  the  DD.  For example,  someone named
     Gerhard Barth added two files,  both of which were already listed
     in  the  DD,  and  proceeded  to write "Updated by Gerhard Barth,
     FidoNews 4-26                Page 12                  13 Jul 1987


     please send all  further  updates  to  Gerhard  Barth,"  etc.  If
     everyone does this, how will anyone know which file is the latest
     and TRUE Dirty Dozen?  If you have an update,  please see the end
     of this article for information on  how  to  reach  me  with  new
     information.

      A word on TROJANS:  I have been hearing more and more reports of
     these "worm" programs,  from all directions.  While I don't doubt
     their existence, do not get hysterical.  Remember, a Trojan rumor
     is  much  easier  to  START than it is to STOP.  Some people have
     accused legitimate *joke* programs, like DRAIN (which pretends to
     be gurgling excess water out of your A drive) of being "killers."

     If a program locks up your system,  it isn't necessarily  Trojan;
     it  might  not  like co-residing with Superkey,  or your graphics
     card.  Ask around a  little  before  you  announce  something  as
     Trojan.  I  would appreciate a bagged specimen of any real Trojan
     program that you might have the (un)luck to find.

      A word on Pirated programs:  Recently many pirated programs such
     as  AUTODEX have been going under many different names.  Although
     I will try to keep all these names current in the  DD,  the  best
     way to check for piracy in a file is to run that file yourself --
     checking  for  (C)opyright  notices  of  commercial manufactures,
     similarities in looks and operations of commercial programs,  and
     of course whether the name is in this list.

       Finally  I want to thank all BBS SysOps and users that notified
     me of updates,  additions,  and/or corrections  to  DIRTYDOZ.006.
     It's  great  to  see  so much support!  In this issue more people
     than ever called in with updates.  Everyone else who  reads  this
     list, along with myself, really appreciates the effort!


     NOTE:  If  I do not supply a file extension,  that means that the
     file circulates under many different  extensions.  For  instance,
     users  commonly  upload  with extensions of either:  .EXE,  .COM,
     .EQE, .CQM, .LBR, .LQR, and .ARC.


     TROJAN HORSE PROGRAMS:

     Name            Category  Notes

     ANTI-PCB        *TROJAN*  The story behind this trojan horse is
                               sickening.  Apparently one RBBS-PC
                               sysop and one PC-BOARD sysop started
                               feuding about which BBS system is
                               better, and in the end the PC-BOARD
                               sysop wrote a trojan and uploaded it to
                               the rbbs SysOp under ANTI-PCB.COM.  Of
                               course the RBBS-PC SysOp ran it, and
                               that led to quite a few accusations and
                               a big mess in general.  Let's grow up!
                               Every SysOp has the right to run the
                               type of BBS that they please, and the
     FidoNews 4-26                Page 13                  13 Jul 1987


                               fact that a SysOp actually wrote a
                               trojan intended for another simply
                               blows my mind.

     ARC513.EXE      *TROJAN*  This hacked version of arc appears
                               normal, so beware!  It will write over
                               track 0 of your [hard] disk upon usage,
                               destroying the disk.

     ARC514.COM      *TROJAN*  This is totally similar to arc version
                               5.13 in that it will overwrite track 0
                               (FAT Table) of your hard disk.  Also, I
                               have yet to see an .EXE version of this
                               program..

     BACKTALK        *TROJAN*  This program used to be a good PD
                               utility, but some one changed it to be
                               trojan.  Now this program will
                               write/destroy sectors on your [hard]
                               disk drive.  Use this with caution if
                               you acquire it, because it's more than
                               likely that you got a bad copy.

     CDIR.COM        *TROJAN*  This program is supposed to give you a
                               color directory of files on disk, but
                               it in fact will scramble your disks FAT
                               table.

     DANCERS.BAS     *TROJAN*  This trojan shows some animated dancers
                               in color, and then proceeds to wipe out
                               your [hard] disk's FAT table.  There is
                               another perfectly good copy of
                               DANCERS.BAS on BBS's around the
                               country; apparently the idiot author in
                               question altered a legitimate program
                               to do his dirty work.

     DISKSCAN.EXE    *TROJAN*  This was a PC-MAGAZINE program to scan
                               a (hard) disk for bad sectors, but then
                               a joker edited it to WRITE bad sectors.
                               Also look for this under other names
                               such as SCANBAD.EXE and BADDISK.EXE...

     DMASTER         *TROJAN*  This is yet another FAT scrambler..

     DOSKNOWS.EXE    *TROJAN*  I'm still tracking this one down --
                               apparently someone wrote a FAT killer
                               and renamed it DOSKNOWS.EXE, so it
                               would be confused with the real,
                               harmless DOSKNOWS system-status
                               utility.  All I know for sure is that
                               the REAL DOSKNOWS.EXE is 5376 bytes
                               long.  If you see something called
                               DOSKNOWS that isn't close to that size,
                               sound the alarm.  More info on this one
                               is welcomed -- a bagged specimen

                               especially.

     DPROTECT        *TROJAN*  Apparently someone tampered with the
                               original, legitimate version of
                               DPROTECT and turned it into a FAT table
                               eater.

     DROID.EXE       *TROJAN*  This trojan appears under the guise of
                               a game.  You are supposedly an
                               architect that controls futuristic
                               droids in search of relics.  In fact,
                               PC-Board sysops, if they run this
                               program from C:\PCBOARD, will find that
                               it copies C:\PCBOARD\PCBOARD.DAT to
                               C:\PCBOARD\HELP\HLPX.  In case you were
                               wondering, the file size of the .EXE
                               file is 54,272 bytes.

     EGABTR          *TROJAN*  BEWARE! Description says something like
                               "improve your EGA display," but when
                               run it deletes everything in sight and
                               prints "Arf! Arf!  Got you!"

     EMMCACHE        *CAREFUL* This program is not exactly a trojan,
                               but it may have the capability of
                               destroying hard disks by:
                                  A) Scrambling every file modified
                                     after running the program,
                                  B) Destroying boot sectors.
                               This program has damaged at least two
                               hard disks, yet there is a base of
                               happily registered users.  Therefore, I
                               advise extreme caution if you decide to
                               use this program.

     FILER.EXE       *TROJAN*  One SysOp complained a while ago that
                               this program wiped out his 20 Megabyte
                               HD.  I'm not so sure that he was
                               correct and/or telling the truth any
                               more.  I have personally tested an
                               excellent file manager also named
                               FILER.EXE, and it worked perfectly.
                               Also, many other SysOp's have written
                               to tell me that they have like me used
                               a FILER.EXE with no problems.  If you
                               get a program named FILER.EXE, it is
                               probably alright, but better to test it
                               first using some security measures.


     FINANCE4.ARC    *CAREFUL* This program is not a verified trojan;
                               there is simply a file going around
                               BBS's warning that it may be trojan.
                               In any case, execute extreme care with
                               it.

     FUTURE.BAS      *TROJAN*  This "program" starts out with a very
                               nice color picture (of what I don't
                               know) and then proceeds to tell you
                               that you should be using your computer
                               for better things than games and
                               graphics.  After making that point it
                               trashes your A: drive, B:, C:, D:, and
                               so on until it has erased all drives.
                               It does not go after the FAT alone, but
                               it also erases all of your data.  As
                               far as I know, however, it erases only
                               one sub-directory tree level deep, thus
                               hard disk users should only be
                               seriously affected if they are in the
                               "root" directory.  I'm not sure about
                               this on either, though.

     NOTROJ.COM      *TROJAN*  This "program" is the most
                               sophisticated trojan horse that I've
                               seen to date.  All outward appearances
                               indicate that the program is a useful
                               utility used to FIGHT other trojan
                               horses.  Actually, it is a time bomb
                               that erases any hard disk FAT table
                               that IT can find, and at the same time
                               it warns: "another program is
                               attempting a format, can't abort!"
                               After erasing the FAT(s), NOTROJ then
                               proceeds to start a low level format.
                               One extra thing to note: NOTROJ only
                               damages FULL hard drives; if a hard
                               disk is under 50% filled, this program
                               won't touch it!  If you are interested
                               in reading a thorough report on
                               NOTROJ.COM, James H.  Coombes has
                               written an excellent text file on the
                               matter named NOTROJ.TXT.  If you have
                               trouble finding it, you can get it from
                               my board.

                               W.Stickle.

     TSRMAP          *TROJAN*  This program does what it's supposed to
                               do: give a map outlining the location
                               (in RAM) of all TSR programs, but it
                               also erases the boot sector of drive
                               "C:".

     PACKDIR         *TROJAN*  This utility is supposed to "pack"
                               (sort and optimize) the files on a
                               [hard] disk, but apparently it
                               scrambles FAT tables.

     PCW271xx.ARC    *TROJAN*  A modified version of the popular PC-

     FidoNews 4-26                Page 16                  13 Jul 1987


                               scrambled at least 10 FAT tables that I
                               know of.  If you want to download
                               version 2.71 of PC-WRITE be very
                               careful!  The bogus version can be
                               identified by its size; it uses 98,274
                               bytes whereas the good version uses
                               98,644.  For reference, version 2.7 of
                               PC-WRITE occupies 98,242 bytes.

     QUIKREF        *TROJAN*   This ARChive claims that it will load
                               RBBS-PC's message file into memory 2
                               times faster than normal.  What it
                               really does is copy RBBS-PC.DEF into an
                               ASCII file named HISCORES.DAT...

     RCKVIDEO         *TROJAN* This is another trojan that does what
                               it's supposed to do, then wipes out
                               hard disks.  After showing some simple
                               animation of a rock star ("Madonna," I
                               think), the program will go to work on
                               erasing every file it can lay it's
                               hands on.  After about a minute of
                               this, it will create 3 ascii files that
                               say "You are stupid to download a video
                               about rock stars," or something of the
                               like.

     SECRET.BAS       *TROJAN* BEWARE!! This may be posted with a note
                               saying it doesn't seem to work, and
                               would someone please try it; when you
                               do, it formats your disks.

     SIDEWAYS.COM     *TROJAN* Be careful with this trojan; there is a
                               perfectly legitimate version of
                               SIDEWAYS.EXE circulating.  Both the
                               trojan and the good SIDEWAYS advertise
                               that they can print sideways, but
                               SIDEWAYS.COM will trash a [hard] disk's
                               boot sector instead.  The trojan .COM
                               file is about 3 KB, whereas the
                               legitimate .EXE file is about 30 KB
                               large.

     STAR.EXE         *TROJAN* Beware RBBS-PC SysOps!  This file puts
                               some stars on the screen while copying
                               RBBS-PC.DEF to another name that can be
                               downloaded later!

     STRIPES.EXE      *TROJAN* Similar to STAR.EXE, this one draws an
                               American flag (nice touch), while it's
                               busy copying your RBBS-PC.DEF to
                               another file (STRIPES.BQS) so Bozo can
                               log in later, download STRIPES.BQS, and
                               steal all your passwords.  Nice, huh!

     TOPDOS           *TROJAN* This is a simple high level [hard] disk
                               formatter.

     VDIR.COM         *TROJAN* This is a disk killer that Jerry
                               Pournelle wrote about in BYTE Magazine.
                               I have never seen it, although a
                               responsible friend of mine has.

      This is the end of the  "bad  files  list."  The  rest  of  this
     document  contains instructions on what to do if YOU run a trojan
     horse, an update history, a glossary,  and information on how and
     where to contact me with updates.

      If you run a trojan horse..

      While reading this,  bear in mind that there is no better remedy
     for a drive that has run a trojan horse than a recent backup..

      The first thing to do after running  what  you  think  to  be  a
     trojan  horse  is  diagnose  the  damage.  Was  your [hard] drive
     formatted?  Did the trojan scramble your  FAT  table?  Did  every
     file  get  erased?  Did  your boot sector on the [hard] drive get
     erased/formatted?  Odds are that the trojan incurred one of these
     four disasters..  After the initial diagnosis,  you are ready  to
     remedy the problem.


      1) If the trojan low-level formatted your [hard] disk: Hope that
         you have a recent backup;  that's the only  remedy  for  this
         disease.

      2) If the trojan high-level formatted your [hard] disk: There is
         only  one way out of this mess,  and that is to use the MACE+
         utilities by Paul Mace.  MACE+  has  two  devices  in  it  to
         recover formatted disks,  and believe me,  they work!  I will
         talk more about the MACE+ utilities later.

      3) If the trojan scrambled your FAT table:  Once again, there is
         nothing   to   do.   However,   there  is  a  program  called
         FATBACK.COM (available on my  board  named  as  FATBCK11.ARC)
         that will back up your FAT table in under a minute to floppy.
         Using  FATBACK,  it is easy and non time consuming to back up
         your FAT regularly.

      4) If the trojan erased file(s), and the FAT table is undamaged:
         There are many packages to  undelete  deleted  files.  Norton
         Utilities,  PC-tools,  MACE+,  and  UNDEL.COM will all do the
         job.   I  recommend  the  first  three,  but  they  are  more
         expensive than the Public Domain program UNDEL.COM.  When you
         are  undeleting,  be  sure  to undelete files in the order of
         last  time  written   to   disk.   I   know   that   PC-tools
         automatically  lists  undeletable files in the correct order,
         but the other three may not.

      5) If the boot sector on your [hard] disk gets erased/formatted:
         There are four things to do if this happens,  and  the  worst
     FidoNews 4-26                Page 18                  13 Jul 1987


         that can happen is that you will go without a [hard] disk for
         a while.  To be on the safest side, back up everything before
         even  proceeding  to  step "A," although I can not see why it
         would be necessary.

         A) Try doing a "SYS C:" (or "SYS A:") from your original  DOS
            disk,  and  copy  COMMAND.COM  back  onto the [hard] drive
            after that.  Try booting and if that doesn't work try step
            B.

         B) If  you  have  the  MACE+  utilities  go  to  the   "other
            utilities"  section and "restore boot sector." This should
            do the job if you have been using MACE+ correctly.

         C) If you are still stuck,  BACK EVERYTHING UP and proceed to
            do  a  low level format.  Instructions on how to perform a
            low-level  format  should  come  with  your  [hard]   disk
            controller  card.  Be  sure  to  map out bad sectors using
            either SCAV.COM by Chris Dunford or by  manually  entering
            the  locations  of  bad  sectors into the low level format
            program.  After the low level format,  if your have a hard
            disk,  run  FDISK.COM (it comes with DOS) and create a DOS
            partition.  Refer to your DOS manual  for  help  in  using
            FDISK.  Then  put  your  original DOS diskette in drive A:
            and do a FORMAT  <drive  letter>:/S/V.  Drive  letter  can
            stand  for  "C"  or  "B"  depending  on  whether  you  are
            reformatting a hard disk or not.  Finally you are ready to
            attempt a reboot.

         D) If you are still stuck,  either employ  some  professional
            computer repairmen to fix your drive,  or live with a non-
            bootable [hard] drive..



      By now you may be saying to yourself:

     "How  can  I  get a hold of a 'MACE+' utilities package so that I
     can guard against trojans?  Why,  MACE+ can recover  a  formatted
     drive, undelete files, restore boot sectors, optimize a disk, and
     provide a disk cache!

      Anyone  can obtain these marvelous utilities in one of two ways:
     one is to call up the Paul Mace Software Company (tm)  and  order
     them  at  a  retail  of $ 79.95.  The other is place an order for
     them at the WEST LOS ANGELES PC-STORE,  which supports  next  day
     UPS  shipping!  The BBS phone # for the PC-STORE is at the end of
     this document.

     Are you tired of the same old thing, are you catering to the same
     old users and tired of maintaining the same old BBS?  Well have
     you ever thought of putting up a whole new BBS, cater to a new
     group of users, but haven't wanted to lose the established crowd
     you have worked so hard for?  Well have I go a deal for you!

     Why not leave your old BBS as it is and put up a second one and
     use the same phone line for both?  This was a problem presented
     to me when one of the local syslops had to give up an adult board
     when his parents found it.

     The idea of two BBS's isn't new and I don't lay claim to it.  The
     OTHER Side was originally a second BBS that was invoked with the
     'O' command.

     This worked okay but had some definite problems. First when the
     second BBS was called up it loaded one on top of the other and
     used all available memory (DoubleDOS was out of the question).
     It also had the tendency to screw up the on line time if you
     switched back and forth.

     I approached Randy Bush with the problem and after some gentle
     reminding he built a little program called CHOOSER.   What
     CHOOSER does is sit between SeaDOG  or Dutchie and the BBS.
     SeaDOG answers the phone and then passes control to CHOOSER,
     CHOOSER then asks the caller what he wants to do.  Currently
     there are 10 possibilities,  depending on a reply of 0,1,,,,,9
     CHOOSER passes the error level to a small batch file that then
     invokes your regular BBS command line.

     This has enabled me to effectively run two BBS's off of one phone
     line. SeaDOG now calls up OSWEGO OPERA (Chooser) that then asks
     you if you want OSWEGO OPUS (1) or OSWEGO's OTHER Side (2).

     Think of the possibilities, you can run your regular BBS (OSWEGO
     OPUS) and beta test another software package (FIDO V12) or maybe
     run the same BBS but with two different bbs packages (Opus and
     Fido, same files areas and message areas) or possibly become
     demented like I have and run the same software but each side has
     two different themes. (the OTHER Side is a sexually oriented BBS)

     I have two sperate user.bbs and am able to keep OSWEGO OPUS at
     the same level it has always been (whatever that is).

     CHOOSER.ARC is file requestable from DawGone Disgusted 105/6. It
     doesn't like X00 as a fossil driver and really requires the most
     current version of OPUSCOMM.

     I'm including my runbbs.bat and also the complete DOCs file for
     CHOOSER.
     so you can see just how simple the setup is.

     Vietnam Veterans' Valhalla IFNA 143/27

       INTERNATIONAL VIETNAM VETERANS' ECHOCONFERENCE ANNIVERSARY!!!

          Well, here I am again,  this makes about the fifth article I
     published  in  this distinguished (?) newsletter over the past 12
     months.  Many of you probably at least recognize my name  if  not
     already  know  who  I  am.  But,  for  those  of  you who are not
     familiar with my not-so-illustrious personage,  I am the SysOp of
     the Vietnam Veterans' Valhalla Opus BBS in San Jose,  California.
     I am also  the  founder  and  international  coordinator  of  the
     Vietnam Veterans' EchoConference.  Without the indefatigable help
     and support from the several dozen Fido/Opus/TBBS SysOps who host
     the   conference   on  their  own  bulletin  boards  making  it's
     intelligent and mature debates and  communications  available  to
     hundreds of readers across the continent.  The conference network
     has  grown  steadily  from  the  one  lonely  BBS  in  San  Jose,
     California (then know only as the  LooneyBin),  to  an  organized
     cluster  of  some  40  bulletin  boards  located from the far-off
     islands of Hawaii,  clear across the central United States to New
     York   and   Canada.   The   ever-increasing  visibility  of  the
     International Vietnam Veterans' EchoConference offered  by  these
     doughty   SysOps   contributes   greatly   to  it's  overwhelming
     popularity and undeniable success.

          It has been said that the Vietnam  Veterans'  EchoConference
     has  become  "one  of  the most important and productive echomail
     conferences available in the Untited States today."  Frankly,  my
     own  modesty  makes me question the validity of that declaration,
     but the  depth  and  maturity  of  the  conference  message  base
     substantially  demonstrates  is  the  need for a support resourse
     like  it  in  todays  often  mis-directed,  largely  mis-informed
     society  whose  level  of  collective  familiarity  with  the era
     surrounding the Vietnam conflict is practically non-existent.

          A short while back I  conducted  a  survey  of  the  various
     SysOps hosting the International Vietnam Veterans' EchoConference
     in  an  attemp  to  gather  statistical  data  related  to  their
     individual caller bases.  The results  of  my  analysis  indicate
     upwards to 2000 people have read the conference message base, and
     that  approximately  40%  of  those  are  military veterans.  The
     remaining 60% are composed of a diverse variety of ex-protesters,
     ex-supporters,   ex-Vietnamese  civilians  and  military,   draft
     dodgers, etc.

          A  significant  number  of  vets  have  found  solace in the
     International Vietnam Veterans' EchoConference  during  the  year
     the  echomail project has been in place.  They have found a place
     where they can "bare their souls" wihtout fear of having to  deal
     with  someone  else' reaction to what they have to say.  They can
     also take their time inputting their messages in the comfort  and
     safety  of  their  own  homes.  They  can also respond to sincere
     questions placed in the conference by the numerous  non-vets  who
     are  interested  in  knowing about the Vietnam conflict and those
     who served in the war.  Some very  meaningful  communication  has
     FidoNews 4-26                Page 24                  13 Jul 1987


     taken place between the vets and non-vets, as well as every other
     combination  of  the  two.  A lot of vets have found their way to
     professional therapy and guidance through the VA Vietnam Era  Vet
     Centers.  The  entire  continent-wide  network  acts like the one
     massive support network it has become.  We all lend  comfort  and
     support  to  one  another,  even  if  our problem is not directly
     related to Vietnam.  We all need emotional encouragement at times
     and many people have found  a  niche  in  the  Vietnam  Veterans'
     EchoConference.  And not all of them are veterans.

          Last  month the conference celebrated its first anniversary.
     We were a year old on the 16th of June!  We have  grown.  We  are
     stable.  We  are  productive.  We  are a valuable service in this
     country where most everything comes at a cost.

          We are still trying to spread,  too.  If you are a sysop and
     would  like to host this conference,  either contact me direct at
     143/27,  or contact one of  the  regional  coordinators  for  the
     Vietnam Veterans EchoConference listed below.  Any one of us will
     help you get aboard (with a full message base to boot!).

          If  you  are  not  a sysop of a Fido or Opus bulletin board,
     please give us a call.  You should be able to find a local  sysop
     carrying  the  conference  listed in the ORIGIN statements listed
     below  each  message,  or  ask  your  local  sysop  to  host  the
     conference on his or her board!

          We are looking forward to hearing from you!

                             Borland's Turbo C:
                               Review, part 2
                         (continued from last week)

     HARDWARE INTERFACE

         Turbo offers more than you could ever imagine in the  way  of
     interfacing with assembler,  other languages, interrupts (calling
     and being), TSRing, and everything else.  Turbo offers (via MASM)
     inline   ASSEMBLY   source  which  can  reference  any  C  symbol
     accessible  at  that  point  (provided  it  makes  sense  in  the
     context),  even labels to C statements.  If that's not enough, or
     is too much,  all registers  can  be  accessed  through  "pseudo-
     variables,"  like  _AX,  _BX,  etc.,  for all the general purpose
     variables,   not  including  IP  and  flags  (which  aren't  very
     accessible  in assembler,  either).  If you need more power,  the
     documentation for writing your own assembler programs  is  clear,
     complete,  easy  to understand,  and all-encompassing.  It is the
     best I have ever seen,  and I've seen a lot.  In addition,  Turbo
     allows  you  to  generate  interrupts,  write interrupt routines,
     terminate  and  stay  resident  (and  Turbo  C  programs  can  be
     converted into .COM files),  call bios routines very easily,  set
     interrupt vectors,  set a control break handler,  set a  hardware
     error  handler  ("Abort,  Retry,  Ignore?"),  and a million other
     things.  MS C style DOS calls are offered,  too.  One example  of
     these  routines  is  bioscom(),   call  the  BIOS  communications
     routines.  With this call,  IT IS POSSIBLE TO  INTERFACE  TO  ANY
     FOSSIL  DRIVER WITH NO ASSEMBLER PROGRAM SUPPORT!  I have in fact
     written a program dependant only on Turbo C's  libraries  to  use
     Opus!Comm,  without the need of external assembler routines.  One
     statement does it all.  THIS is  POWER.  Turbo  Lighting  can  be
     called  just  as  easily  using  the bioskey().  And Turbo C also
     offers Pascal-style parameter passing for those "older"  routines
     you've written.

     DOCUMENTATION

         The  documentation  for Turbo C,  contained in two voluminous
     manuals, is the User's Guide (300 pages, 2 centimeters thick) and
     the Reference Manual (385 pages,  2.5 centimeters).  Both are the
     usual  paperback,  and  are written so that beginners and experts
     alike  will  love  it.   It  offers  an  excellent   step-by-step
     introduction to the integrated environment for beginners, as well
     as a short two-chapter coverage of the C language.  There are two
     chapters  for  interfacing  with  Turbo  Prolog  and  a  thorough
     comparison  with  Turbo Pascal,  complete with side-by-side code,
     and,  my  favorite,  caveats  to  avoid.   Borland's  insight  is
     incredible in the two sections they devote to "Common Pitfalls of
     Programmers  Using  C,"  one for programmers in general,  one for
     Turbo Pascal programmers.  They cover the usual  screw-ups,  like
     FidoNews 4-26                Page 26                  13 Jul 1987


     using  assignment for comparison,  the difference between strings
     and arrays, zero based arrays, leaving semicolons off last block,
     case sensitivity,  multi-dimensional  arrays,  omitting  required
     parens  on  function calls,  using \ in constant path names,  and
     forgetting  to  pass  addresses.  All  utilities  are  thoroughly
     explained  in plain language.  Also included is a reference to C,
     similar to the appendix in  the  C  bible,  with  C  bible  cross
     reference.  Also included is a figure of C constructs, again like
     the tail end  of  the  C  bible.  It  covers  the  ANSI  C  draft
     implementation, too.  In general, the documentation is the best I
     have ever seen,  covering  everything  you  wanted  to  know.  It
     handles  beginner  to operating system developer.  The very best,
     written in the wonderful Borland style.

     ENVIRONMENT

         Let's start with the environment.  There are two programs  on
     the Turbo C set; TCC.EXE and TC.EXE.  One is the usual integrated
     enviroment, close to but slightly different from Turbo Prolog and
     Turbo  BASIC.   The  other  is  the  long-awaited  command   line
     environment  that  the  traditional  compiler  is written as,  an
     example of Philippe's insight for the programmers of C  and  care
     for  the customers who asked for it.  Although Turbo C keeps much
     of Borland's magic,  they seemed to have lost the  compiler  code
     size magic:

         TC       EXE   231257   5-20-87   1:00a
         TCC      EXE   169098   5-20-87   1:00a

     As  you  can  C,  Turbo C is HUGE.  So is Turbo BASIC and Prolog.
     Borland has moved into hard  disk  territory.  But  the  features
     gained  well  outweigh  it.  Both programs put together beat MS C
     whose 5 or 6 different files add up to more than a disk, although
     they work in overlays (something  we  may  expect  from  Borland,
     hopefully).

         The  integrated  environment  is  much  like  the  other  new
     generation Borland programs,  with an interface very  similar  to
     TB's. There are two primary windows; one for editing, and one for
     messages.  All  functions are available anyplace in the compiler.
     However,  the old familiar and much-praised compile to memory  is
     gone.  It  has  been  replaced  by a shell-to-dos-and-run scheme,
     which is functionally equivalent, but takes up a lot of memory.

         One of the unique features of Turbo C is the  multiple  error
     message capability, something long awaited.  The Turbo C compiler
     will compile and flag as many errors as you select  then  proceed
     to  put  you,  in  Borland style,  into the source code where the
     first error is.  Hitting F8 will move to the next place  and  the
     next  error  found,  and  so  forth.  Editing the source does not
     invalidate the error positions;  further errors will  always  put
     you in the correct place.

         One  unique  thing about Borland's compiling:  as you compile
     and link, it keeps track of how many warnings and errors flagged,
     source lines compiled,  and amount of memory left,  displayed  in
     FidoNews 4-26                Page 27                  13 Jul 1987


     real time.  When it finishes, it displays all errors and warnings
     and steps through the source code.

         The environment also offers an extensive  "project"  utility,
     similar to make,  but simpler and easier to use.  (A full-fledged
     UNIX make is included as a standalone.)  The  included  MicroCalc
     has an example of a control file for this project manager:

         mcalc (mcalc.h)
         mcparser (mcalc.h)
         mcdisply (mcalc.h)
         mcinput (mcalc.h)
         mcommand (mcalc.h)
         mcutil (mcalc.h)
         mcmvsmem.obj

     This indicates that the source files on the left are dependent on
     the file in parens. There is also an implicit dependency that all
     executable  files  are  dependent  on  all  object  files and the
     project file itself.

         Also included is a  small  CPP  C  Pre-Processor  utility  to
     preprocess  to  a  file (strictly no-frills).  A Touch utility is
     included to update a file's date and time;  used to force a  make
     to occur.

         Turbo  C comes with its own linker.  This linker is about 1/5
     the size of the MicroSoft Linker (that comes with MS  C)  and  is
     much faster:

         TLINK    EXE     9753   5-20-87   1:00a
         LINK     EXE    47896   3-14-86   3:16p

     As  the  manual puts it,  "As we said earlier,  TLINK is lean and
     mean; it does not have an excessive supply of options. . .  .  it
     is not a general replacement for MS Link." Boy, for 1/5 the size,
     it  sure  packs  an  awful  lot.  Let me stress again the Turbo C
     object modules are supposed to be compatible with  every  IBM  or
     MicroSoft  linker,  although  in one instance I ran into problems
     using a non-TLINK linker.  Borland is working on the problem,  as
     well as a bigger linker.

     CODE SIZE and BENCHMARKS

         I  am very impressed with Turbo C's "extensive properties," a
     phrase I just invented to apply to  such  things  as  compilation
     speed,  code size,  execution speed,  and the like.  For the most
     part Turbo C is tight in it's code generation,  the most  notable
     exception being floating point object (but not .EXE) files. Turbo
     C  always optimizes at least space.  You can switch that to speed
     or  turn  on  various  other  optimizations  aforementioned.  The
     compiler is FAST as usual;  a moderately long floating-point low-
     comment program (164  lines,  4329  bytes)  took  48  seconds  to
     compile and link in TC,  but 2 minutes 9 seconds to compile in MS
     C.  The same program had a TC OBJ size of 4191 and EXE size 28140
     emulation,  18236  8087  only;   MSC  OBJ  was  3648,  EXE  29126
     FidoNews 4-26                Page 28                  13 Jul 1987


     emulation, 22214 8087, and 3567/24812 for altmath,  which Turbo C
     doesn't  offer,  but  neither have I found a need for it.  As for
     runtime  execution,  Turbo  C  wins.   The  same  program  (which
     generates hi-res 3-d surfaces, see 80 Micro, May 83, p. 236) took
     4:22 minutes TC and 5:45 minutes MS C (for reference, it takes 15
     minutes  TPascal 8087,  3 hours C without 8087,  15 hours TPascal
     w/o 8087, and well near 24 hours in BASICA). It used square roots
     and sines.

         Other benchmarks:  a UNIX grep utility,  no  floating  point,
     compiled in 49 seconds TC no options,  46 seconds no warnings, 41
     seconds no floating point link search, and 40 seconds no warnings
     or floating point link search;  code size  (obj/exe)  7025/12864.
     MSC  took  2  minutes 50 seconds,  with code size 6795/13608.  My
     favorite,  the null program ("main (){}"),  took 28 seconds in TC
     and  50  seconds in MS C;  code size was 160/1694 TC and 276/1986
     MSC. All times are for both compile and link.

         I have had only one problem in the week or two I've had Turbo
     C,  and that was the handling of floating point exceptions.  This
     is the only problem I've seen; other than that it's flawless.

         In  conclusion,  Turbo  C is 99% the functionality of MS C in
     some places,  101% in others,  but at 20%  the  price  (discount;
     reference:  PC  Connection),  and besides that,  it took them one
     version,  not three or four.  It is fast in  both  compiling  and
     executing,  produces  tight code,  offers advanced warnings,  can
     produce .COM files,  can be  used  to  write  TSRs,  has  several
     optimization  settings,  and  will be very well supported.  Every
     programmer should have a copy.  However,  if you do want to get a
     copy,  I recommend expedience, because Borland does not guarantee
     the current price beyond July 1st,  and Turbo C is sure  worth  a
     heck of a lot more than $99.

                             Echo mail routing

     It's been 5 months now since I have been into Echo Mail.  I run a
     backbone  on  one  echo  (*plug on* - the Broadcast echos ,  also
     including the Request Line for the Public  -  *plug  off*),  feed
     another  node  across  the  country,  and am down line on several
     others.  Because of this, I have run into several combinations of
     software (SEAdog/TBBS,  SEAdog/OPUS,  SEAdog/FIDO, FIDO/OPUS, and
     of course, FIDO by itself).

     The biggest problem that most of the mail  systems  run  into  is
     this:

         Node  A  polls  or  sends  some  mail  to Node B.  Node B has
         messages waiting for Node A, but when Node A calls,  he isn't
         given any mail packets.

     Let's start with the route files. Here's how we want our route to
     look every night:

         at 1:00 AM we will poll 1000/1 for any mail
         at 3:30 AM we will route outgoing mail to our host
         at 4:00 AM we run National Mail hour
         at 5:00 AM we will hold mail for 1000/2 to pick up.

     This takes 4 seperate routes.  If you run SEAdog, they can all go
     into your one ROUTE.DOG file. Here's how they should look:

         Schedule E                      ; (route.e)  polls 1000/1
         HOLD     ALL except 1000/1
         SEND-TO  ALL
         GIVE-TO  ALL
         POLL     1000/1

     - the HOLD statement places all mail in a  hold  status  in  case
       another  node  calls  in looking for his mail.  DO NOT HOLD any
       mail packets to nodes you are sending to or polling.

     - the SEND-TO statement allows HOLD mail to  be  released  if  an
       incoming call comes in.

     - the  GIVE-TO  will  give the mail you have for 1000/1 to 1000/1
       when you call him.

     - the POLL statement makes sure that you will call 1000/1 whether
       or not you have mail for him.  If you only want to call  1000/1
       IF you have mail for him, don't use the POLL statement.

     Next, we want to route our mail to our host.  But, in case we did
     not connect with 1000/1,  we still want to keep it here  and  not
     route it. Run a route that looks like this:

     FidoNews 4-26                Page 30                  13 Jul 1987


         Schedule G                      ; (route.g) local routing
         ROUTE-TO  [your host net/node]  ALL
         NO-ROUTE  1000/1 1000/2
         SEND-TO   [your host net/node]
         PICKUP    [your host net/node]
         GIVE-TO   ALL

     - the ROUTE-TO will route ALL to [your host net/node].

     - the  NO-ROUTE  keeps  mail  you hold at a later time from being
       sent over to your host for routing.

     - the SEND-TO and PICKUP are here for you to be able to make  the
       call to your host if you have mail to send out.

     - the  GIVE-TO statement gives mail to incoming callers that have
       mail waiting.

     Next, we want to run the National Mail hour.  Remember,  we don't
     want  to send or route any of 1000/1 or 1000/2 mail,  as they are
     dealt with later. Here's the sample route file:

         Schedule A                      ; (route.a) natl mail hour
         NO-ROUTE  1000/1 1000/2
         HOLD      1000/1 1000/2
         SEND-TO   ALL
         GIVE-TO   ALL

     - the NO-ROUTE makes sure that the mail  for  1000/1  and  1000/2
       stays at your node.

     - the HOLD keeps your node from calling these nodes directly.

     - the  SEND-TO calls the nodes you have not routed mail for,  and
       that you have mail at your location for.

     - the GIVE-TO gives the mail to any incoming calls that have  any
       mail waiting.

     You  could  also add a PICKUP ALL in the route so when you call a
     node to drop off mail,  you can pick up any mail for you that  he
     may have waiting.

     Confused YET ? If not, I'll try harder.

     Now, we're going to hold some mail for 1000/2.  Here's where most
     nodes get into trouble- the ability to actually give mail  to  an
     incoming caller that has messages there.

     Here's out holding route for 1000/2:

         Schedule F                      ; (route.f) hold for 1000/2
         HOLD     ALL
         SEND-TO  ALL
         GIVE-TO  ALL

     FidoNews 4-26                Page 31                  13 Jul 1987


     - the HOLD keeps your system from calling out.

     - the  SEND-TO  releases  packets  to an incoming caller that has
       mail waiting.

     - the GIVE-TO actually gives the packet to the caller.

     Ahhhhh, finished. Just remember this important rule:

     * you MUST BE IN A MAIL EVENT TO GIVE MAIL TO A POLLING NODE,  no
       matter what type of system you run. *

     Next week.  we'll take a look at the schedule configurations, and
     if you run SEAdog,  how to put up a true 24 hour mail system with
     your BBS.

     Don't  forget  to call in and request our latest utility - MSGDB.
     It can be requested by filename MSGDB.ARC .  The  arc  file  also
     contains  FIXDATE  - a simple utility that corrects those off the
     wall dates we see in the echo areas.

     That's all for now.  If you have any  broadcasters  calling  into
     your BBS,  you may want to join one of our Broadcast Echos.  Just
     Net_Mail me at 100/517...
                                     And that's the way it was...

          Well, things  have gone  somewhat better  this week. The new
     system has been performing flawlessly, and  I actually  enjoy the
     new keyboard.  Things are looking up here, if things keep working
     out I may even become a public access board again  (right now I'm
     a private node, so mail to me has to be routed). This has made it
     necessary for me to look into a few new things,  so I'm  going to
     start off by asking for your help.

     -- What's a LAN? --

          As you  may recall,  last week's  problems were  caused by a
     keyboard failure and a lack of my old XT clone.  In an  effort to
     prevent that  from ever happening again, I bought a stripped down
     clone at a hamfest this weekend  (someone else  had just upgraded
     to an AT and wanted to get rid of their old machine). After I got
     it home, I dug up some old cards and brought it up to 640K with a
     20 meg  hard disk.  While this  is primarily intended as a backup
     machine, I've been thinking about using  it as  a public bulletin
     board.  After  I  got  everything  hooked  up and tested, an idea
     occurred to me. Instead of having two separate  machines; one for
     me to work on, and another dedicated to a bulletin board; why not
     attach the two with  a local  area network.  This way  I could go
     over  my  mail,  maintain  the  board,  and not have to duplicate
     message bases on two different machines. There's only one problem
     with this, I don't know the first thing about LANs.

          This  isn't  to  say  I  don't approve of (or rather haven't
     approved of) local area  networks. It  has always  sounded like a
     great way  to do some things (like sharing an expensive printer).
     I've just never been in an environment where it was practical. At
     my current  job, there's exactly one PC in the office and it sits
     on my desk. It's a small office and no one else really  knows how
     to use  a computer.  I got  the AT  at the office because my boss
     noticed  how  long  it  took  the  computer  to  recalculate some
     spreadsheets and  re-index a database. He asked me if there was a
     way to speed it up, and the company ended up buying an  AT for me
     to work  on. Most  of what  I've learned  has come through actual
     experience, and I've just never has a chance  to install  or work
     on a LAN. Since I now have a situation where one might be useful,
     I'm going to look into buying  one. In  this endeavor,  I ask for
     your help.

          I currently have an AT clone running at 10 mhz with a 42 meg
     MiniScribe hard disk (using SpeedStor to make it  look like three
     drives; a 21 meg drive for my work, a 10 meg drive for files, and
     a 10 meg drive for messages with 1K clusters). The "new" XT clone
     is running  at 4.77  mhz and  has a  20 meg  Seagate ST225 with a
     Western Digital controller. What I'd like to do is set  up the XT
     as  a  bulletin  board,  with  all  BBS programs, utilities, file
     areas, and message bases residing on it's own hard drive.  The AT
     should  ideally  be  able  to  read  the  message  bases (through
     SEAdog's user interface), and be able to do  the bulletin board's
     FidoNews 4-26                Page 33                  13 Jul 1987


     maintenance. If  possible I  would also like the AT to be able to
     use the modem in the XT  for  dialing  out  (mainly  to  the Unix
     machine I  use occasionally)  although it  wouldn't be necessary.
     Since I don't expect any LAN to fill  these needs  perfectly, I'd
     appreciate hearing from your own experiences with ANY LAN. At the
     end of the column  there are  several different  adresses for me,
     just make  certain you  specify which  LAN you're  using and what
     software is being used to run  it. I'll  sum up  the opinions and
     advantages between the different networks sometime in the future.

     -- The AT clone --

          My first comment on the new AT clone is WOW! Unless you have
     ever  worked  on  an  AT  before,  you  would  never  believe the
     difference  in   speed.  As  an  example  of  this,  my  echomail
     processing has dropped to an unbelievably short time. In spite of
     my private status, I pass along echomail to 5 nodes in net 157. I
     start processing  the echomail  at 6:30  every morning  (NMH + 30
     minutes). As  soon as  it's done, I send it out to the four nodes
     that are running SEAdog. In the past, my  system usually finished
     up the echomail processing between 7:30 and 8:30 depending on the
     amount of mail being sent out.  Since I  switched everything over
     to the  AT, the  mail has gone out by 7:00 every day (at least it
     starts calling out at 7:00). I'm using this as a  comparison only
     because it will hopefully mean something to most of the sysops in
     FidoNet, at least I think  it  means  more  than  a  straight out
     benchmark  (Norton's  SI  of  9.8,  just  in  case  you like that
     "benchmark").

     -- Speedstor (Storage Dimensions, $99.95) --

          The Miniscribe 6053 hard disk came with SpeedStor,  which is
     a partitioning "program." With any drive over 32 meg you run into
     a problem, DOS won't recognize a larger hard drive (PC-DOS 3.3 is
     supposed to  "fix" this, but I've heard that it has problems with
     non-IBM equipment). While it is  possible  to  do  strange things
     with FDISK  and your  controller card to make these larger drives
     act like several different hard drives  (C,D,E,etc) it  was never
     that easy.  Speedstor makes  this task  easy, while also allowing
     you to use a "non-standard drive." In an AT, all  the information
     on the type of hard drive is stored in non-volatile memory. There
     are at least 14 different types of hard drives that  the AT knows
     about (IBM  started off  with 14  and everyone  supports at least
     those same  drive  types)  that  can  be  used  with  no trouble.
     Unfortunately the  Miniscribe 6053  isn't usually one of them. In
     the past this meant part of the hard disk was  wasted, as  the AT
     didn't  know  how  to  address  the  extra  cylinders  or  heads.
     Speedstor gets around this by keeping it's own information on the
     type of  hard drive  being used (I think in the non-volatile RAM,
     but I'm not certain). When the  system  boots  up,  it  loads the
     Speedstor software  (one line  in the CONFIG.SYS) and your system
     now knows about this non-standard drive.

          In addition to letting use your drive to it's full capacity,
     Speedstor let's you do some more unusual things. While I'm fairly
     certain that it will let you get past the 32 meg limit  of DOS, I
     FidoNews 4-26                Page 34                  13 Jul 1987


     didn't try  it. What  it does  do very  easily is allow each hard
     drive partition act like a separate drive. Right  now I  have one
     physical hard  disk in  the AT.  But DOS "knows" about drives C,D
     and E; and I don't have any RAM disks installed.  Using Speedstor
     I made  three partitions on the hard disk. The first partition is
     using one half of the hard drive and is a bootable DOS partition.
     The other  two partitions each have one quarter of the hard drive
     and are usable by DOS (although I may  change this  in the future
     to support XENIX). The nice thing is that the third partition has
     a 1K cluster size. Under DOS 3.x cluster sizes are  normally 2048
     bytes (2K),  this means  your two line batch file is going to use
     2K of your hard disk. If you're running a DOS  2.x it  get's even
     worse as  those versions  of DOS  use an  8K (8192 bytes) cluster
     size. Under Speedstor I  can move  the cluster  size down  to 512
     bytes, although when I tried that with a 10 meg partition it gave
     me some warning about not  enough  space  in  the  FAT  table and
     CHKDSK would  have problems  (I chickened  out and moved it up to
     the next choice). Fido and Opus sysops take note, you  don't have
     to lose insufferable amounts of disk space (due to slack) because
     of your message bases.  I "gained"  over 1  meg of  disk space by
     putting my message bases on this partition with it's 1K clusters.
     If I had felt like spending a little more time I may  have played
     around  with  the  partition  size  and  cluster  size and gotten
     something with no warnings and a 512 byte  cluster size, although
     I don't think the space savings would have been as great.

          If  you  aren't  doing  anything  unusual,  like  I  did, it
     installs very quickly. I initially ran Speedstor's semi-automated
     installation and  ended up  with two 21 meg partitions. All I had
     to do was tell it what type of drive I was using. On the  menu it
     had a  choice called  manufacturer. After I choose it, I was able
     to pick the drive out of a list  of the  three current Miniscribe
     drives. Since my copy is the "Miniscribe version" I'd assume that
     the full version would  include  a  fuller  list  of  drives from
     several manufacturers.  Other than that, about all I had to enter
     was the bad track table for the drive. Almost everything else was
     completely automatic.  Miniscribe is now including Speedstor with
     all of their larger drives, and  from  what  my  dealer  tells me
     Seagate  is  doing  something  similar with a program called Disk
     Manager by OnTrack  (Although  he  says  it  is  nowhere  near as
     powerful  as   Speedstor).  It's  nice  to  see  the  hard  drive
     manufacturers are interested in  the end  user, not  just getting
     their money.  While including  Speedstor or Disk Manager with the
     drive may kick up the price a few dollars, I  feel better getting
     everything  I  need  at  once  rather  than getting the drive and
     finding out a need something else to really use it.

     -- SYSEDIT and SuperKey --

          After I got all the data transferred over to the AT, it came
     time to change all my SYSTEM*.BBS files. Because of the different
     way I set up the new system, I needed to change a  lot of message
     and file  paths. In  the past  everything was on the same logical
     drive (as opposed to a physical drive, of which I have only one),
     while now  it was on two logical drives. This wasn't too bad as I
     dug up a copy of Eric Ewanco's SYSEDIT.  SYSEDIT let's  you go in
     FidoNews 4-26                Page 35                  13 Jul 1987


     and edit  the system  files from  DOS. It  has a nice full screen
     display and is very  easy to  use. I  started doing  every change
     manually but  quickly decided there had to be an easier way to do
     things (I have over  20  echomail  conferences  going  through my
     machine).  Enter  SuperKey  from  Borland  (list  price $69.95) a
     keyboard macro program. I  quickly installed  SuperKey and taught
     it what  needed to be done on all the message bases. I had to put
     in what  Borland refers  to as  a keyboard  delay because SYSEDIT
     didn't  use   the  keyboard   buffers,  but  that  was  the  only
     difficulty. In under five  minutes  I  had  all  my  system files
     changed and  was ready  to go,  or so  I thought. I tried running
     some of the echomail programs, but  it couldn't  find some needed
     directories.  After  puzzling  over  this and checking the system
     files I finally realized what I had forgotten. I had  changed all
     the system  files, but  had forgotten  about SEAdog's CONFIG.DOG,
     AREAS.DOG, and the Fido/Opus  MAIL.SYS file.  After correcting my
     oversight  it  was  finally  changed over and everything has been
     running fine  since.  SYSEDIT  and  SuperKey  are  both excellent
     programs and  helped make this switch over much easier than I had
     anticipated. I've seen I  program  similar  to  SYSEDIT  for OPUS
     systems,  but  I  haven't  managed  to  find it in the Opus files
     directory. Programs like SYSEDIT do a lot to make a  sysop's life
     easier, I'd  encourage you to dig up a program like this (SYSEDIT
     in particular  for Fido  sysops) if  you are  currently running a
     bulletin board.

     -- Winding down... --

          Since I  became interested  in local area networks this past
     week, the book I'm going to  recommend  is  going  to  reflect my
     current  concerns.  "Networking  IBM  PCs,  A Practical Guide" by
     Michael Durr (QUE books, $18.95) has  provided me  with a  lot of
     information on  how a LAN works. While the copy I got ($10 at the
     hamfest I attended) is somewhat out of date, many of the specific
     LANs mentioned  are still  with us.  It provides a description on
     several different LANs (probably most of  the one's  available in
     1984,  the  year  it  was  written)  and  goes  over the features
     available under the network software. It covers many  topics that
     I  have   found  to   be  of  interest  such  as  administration,
     performance, maintenance and such. It has helped explain a lot of
     what goes  on in  a LAN,  and has helped me decide what I'll want
     included in the LAN I buy (Such as a non-dedicated server). While
     the book  has raised  many questions  for me, it has gotten me to
     start thinking about more than the  brand name.  I think  I could
     now shop  intelligently for  a LAN, and have a much better chance
     of  coming  out  with  something  that  will  do  the  job versus
     something the  salesman wanted  to sell me. After all, isn't that
     the whole idea behind  learning a  little about  something before
     you go out and buy it?

          I once again welcome your comments, even ask for them if you
     can help me out with information on LANs. Down below  you'll find
     several addresses for me. Some of you have asked about Compuserve
     or The Source mailboxes or account numbers. Unfortunately I don't
     maintain an  account on  any of  these systems,  only on the more
     public access networks. Since I'm a private node in the nodelist,

     all FidoNet  mail to  me should  be routed through 157/1 or 157/0
     (same  board really). If  you send  me anything  through US mail,
     please  make  sure  I  have  some sort of return address (are you
     hearing this "Ender Wiggin?")  in order to send you a reply. Next
     week I  should be  looking at  a game,  so all  you fellow gaming
     people who have sent me mail be patient. I haven't forgotten you.

          Couple of  quickies  here  that  "came  in"  just  as  I was
     finishing this  column. First, the latest version of the echomail
     conference list is now  available from  Thomas Kenny  at 107/316.
     You can file request under the name "ECHOLIST.ARC." Also, Hewlett
     Packard Laser  Jet printer  owners will  be pleased  to hear that
     Hewlett  Packard  hopes  to  have  a PostScript update for all of
     their laser printers available by the  end  of  the  year.  I'm a
     strong  supporter  of  PostScript,  even  if  IBM has endorsed it
     (Whadda mean Thom? I thought everybody who wrote  on the computer
     scene was  supposed ta  hate IBM. You mean I can actually support
     an IBM decision? S'Allright....)
