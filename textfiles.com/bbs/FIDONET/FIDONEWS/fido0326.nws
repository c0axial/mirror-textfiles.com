          Go placidly amid the  noise  and  waste  and  remember  what
     comfort  there may be in owning a piece thereof.  Avoid quiet and
     passive persons unless you are in  need  of  sleep.  Rotate  your
     tires.  Speak  glowingly  of those greater than yourself and heed
     well their advice,  even though they be  turkeys.  Know  what  to
     kiss, and when.  Consider that two wrongs never make a right, but
     that  three  do.  Wherever  possible,  put  people  on  hold.  Be
     comforted that in the face of all aridity and disillusionment and
     despite the changing fortunes of time,  there  is  always  a  big
     future in computer maintenance.

          Remember  the  Pueblo.  Strive  at all times to bend,  fold,
     spindle,  and mutilate.  Know yourself.  If you need  help,  call
     the FBI.  Exercise caution in your daily affairs, especially with
     those  persons  closest  to  you - that tomato on your left,  for
     instance.  Be assured that a walk through the ocean of most souls
     would scarcely get your feet wet.  Fall not in  love,  therefore;
     it  will  stick to your face.  Gracefully surrender the things of
     youth, birds, clean air, tuna,  Taiwan.  And let not the sands of
     time  get  in  your  lunch.  Hire  people with hooks.  For a good
     time, call 606-4311,  ask for Ken.  Take heart amid the deepening
     gloom  that  your  dog  is  finally  getting  enough cheese.  And
     reflect that whatever misfortune may be your lot,  it could  only
     be worse in Milwaukee.

          You  are  a  fluke of the universe.  You have no right to be
     here.  And whether you can  hear  it  or  not,  the  universe  is
     laughing behind your back.

          Therefore,  make peace with your god,  whatever you conceive
     him to be: hairy thunderer or cosmic muffin.  With all its hopes,
     dreams,  promises,  and urban renewal,  the  world  continues  to
     deteriorate.  Give up.

     Christopher Baker
     Metro-Fire Fido, 135/14

                         ARC F and the Local Sysop

     All of us,  who are System Operators,  know that time is precious
     and  tasks  always seem to expand to fill the available time,  no
     matter what we started out to do.  At no time is this  more  true
     than  when  conducting  Long Distance (LD) BBSing for program up-
     dates or new files.

     There is a tendency for Sysops to put files that have been  ARCed
     and  uploaded  to  them  by  Xmodem  into their download sections
     without checking the file for correct date.  If an ARCed file  is
     transferred  by  Xmodem to a system,  the transfer leaves the ARC
     rounded up to the nearest block and changes the date of the  ARC.
     This  leads  to  confusion,  especially on systems where the file
     description does not include the version number of the program in
     question.  The files within the ARC are, of course, unaffected by
     the  transfer  and their dates are intact but the user cannot run
     ARC v on the file to see the  REAL  date.  This  is  the  Sysop's
     responsibility.

     The  problem is not as prevalent on Fido systems as it is on RBBS
     and other systems that do not support  Telink  or  Kermit.  Since
     Telink and Kermit send the true filename, filesize, and filedate,
     there  is  no  need  to  convert  the  ARCs  back to normal after
     receiving them.  There are still PLENTY of users that  don't  use
     anything  but  Xmodem,  though,  and their uploads need attention
     from the  Sysop  BEFORE  they  are  moved  to  a  download  area,
     particularly, if the R)aw command is available to the user.  When
     I'm in a hurry on LD (and who isn't?),  I use  the  R)aw  command
     whenever  it's  available to check for new filedates and gauge my
     downloading accordingly.

     To avoid the confusion of filedates on ARCs,  the Sysop has  only
     to check the ARC filedate against the internal filedates. If they
     do  not  match,  the  Sysop can bring the ARC into agreement very
     simply by running the Freshen  command  of  ARC.EXE  against  the
     file. To wit:

                           ARC f filename <cr>.

     This  will  write  the file out to the disk,  remove the round up
     block if any,  and restore the ARC filedate to match the dates of
     the  files  within the ARC.  To avoid the possibility of updating
     files within the ARC from  files  in  the  current  directory,  I
     suggest  conducting  these  conversions  in  a  blank  or working
     directory. A blank directory will require at least one dummy file
     to get the re-write going.  Create a dummy file of one line using
     EDLIN  or  the  Copy  CON  <filename> command.  Call it something
     original (like DUMMY.FIL) to avoid matching an existing  filename
     Fidonews                     Page 5                    7 Jul 1986


     in  any  ARC.  You must have enough disk space to accommodate the
     filesize in question and the  matching  filesize  of  the  mirror
     image that ARC F is going to create.

     If  every  Sysop  would  take the time to clean up these Xmodemed
     ARCs,  there would never be a question of how new a file is  when
     BBSing. (Version numbers wouldn't hurt either, you guys.)

                      On-Line Employment Opportunities

          The Employment Opportunities Listings,  available  from  the
     NOVA_WEG  have been available now for two months and the response
     is good after such a short period of time.  In  case  you  missed
     the  FidoNews  article  introducing  this  FREE  service,   in  a
     nutshell,  we have been gathering  current  employment  vacancies
     from  firms  in/or  closely associated with the computer industry
     around the country and making these positions known  via  FidoNet
     Mail  to  whomever would like to receive this listing and make it
     available to others (user's or sysop's).  It  is  updated  weekly
     and  includes other information such as "How to" conduct your job
     search, and we have been "spot-lighting" different companies each
     week in the computer field.

          Currently theses listings are  available  on  the  following
     Fido boards:

          Net/Node              Board Name              Location

          We  understand  that there are other boards currently making
     the listings available by obtaining them from  the  boards  shown
     above.  This we encourage as the more that can benefit from this,
     the better.

          If  there  are  any  other  REGIONAL HOSTS or NET HOSTS that
     would like to make these listing available  to  their  respective
     FidoNodes,  drop  us  a  line via NetMail and we will be happy to
     send the listings to you.  If any individual nodes would like  to

                               LAST EMBRACE
                               by Rich Gough
                          on Fido 129/26

     David turned the key in the lock and opened the door. Hanging his
     coat  in  the  closet,  he  noticed the  flashing  light  on  his
     telephone  answering  machine.  It was 11 PM -- it had taken a  a
     couple  of  hours longer than he expected to fix  the  hard  disk
     problem  at the trucking company.  Flipping the switch,  he heard
     the messages rewind -- buzzing interuppted by 5 beeps.  He sighed
     -- a computer consultant's work is never done.

     "Hey David,  this is Mike. My subscription to TV Guide ran out --
     can you tell me what's going to be on USA Nightflight tonight?"
     BEEP
     "David,  this is Carol at the Food Warehouse.  I've got a problem
     and I need you to call me back as soon as you can. It's 8 PM."
     BEEP
     "David,  this is Carol again. It's 10 PM and I have three reports
     that I have to get down by tommorrow.  Please come over and  help
     me as soon as you can."
     BEEP
     "David, it's 10:30 PM and I'm really desperate."
     BEEP
     "Damn!"
     BEEP

     David  switched  the machine back to record,  and dialed  Carol's
     number. A busy signal told him that at least she was still there.
     She might even be trying to call him. If he left now, he could be
     there by midnight.

     David knocked on the corrugated metal door and when there was  no
     answer,  the  rolled the sliding door aside and stepped in.  Up a
     narrow flight of stairs, past the fans of the cold room. Stepping
     into the office, he heard a crunch and looked at the floor. There
     were  white  fragments all over the floor  -- someone  must  have
     dropped a coffee cup.  That reminded him - coffee. It looked like
     it  would be a long night.  The coffee maker was still plugged in
     -- he poured himself the last cup.  A sip told him it was too hot
     and too bitter. He set it next to the computer and sat down. Time
     for some detective work to find out what was wrong and fix it.

     "Carol!"  he called.  She must be in the Ladies Room.  "Might  as
     well get to work" he said to himself.

     A glance at the screen told him that she was in the middle of the
     General  Ledger program,  closing out the month of  January.  The
     screen  was frozen -- no keys had any effect.  Nothing to do  but
     switch  the computer off and start again.  As he waited  for  the
     hard  disk to settle,  he looked around.  Carol was big on lists.
     Tacked to the wall was a list of the 100 most popular food items.
     On  the desk was a list of her objectives for the  day.  Accounts
     Payable,  Accounts Recievable and General Ledger were at the  top
     of  the list,  and the only things not crossed out.  He knew from
     experience  that these programs were disk  intensive,  and  could
     Fidonews                     Page 9                    7 Jul 1986


     take  hours to run.  He also found the manual to a  multi-tasking
     program  that  could let more than one program run  at  once.  He
     switched the computer on and flipped throught the manual while he
     waited  for  the RAM test to complete.  A look at  Carol's  notes
     showed  what  she  was trying to do -- save time by  running  all
     three reports at the same time.  David knew the problem that must
     have occurred and a few keystrokes proved his conclusion.

     First  he started Accounts Payable,  then created a new task  and
     started  Accounts  Recievable,  then  created a  third  task  and
     started General Ledger.  Hitting a few keys produced no response,
     proving  his  theory  that the system was  locked  in  a  classic
     example of a Deadly Embrace. Programs A and B both need access to
     files  1  and 2.  A file can only be updated by one program at  a
     time.  Program A grabs file 1 while Program B grabs file 2.  Then
     Program  A tries to grab file 2 (which B has locked on to)  while
     Program  B  tries to grab file 1 (which  A  has).  Result  - each
     program  waits for the other to give up its file and no work gets
     done.  With  three programs going at the same time,  the  problem
     would be even worse--crowded together in memory and fighting  for
     the  same files,  it would be a sort of menage a trois.  The only
     solutions  are to avoid running programs that use the same  files
     at the same time.  If you must, make sure all programs open files
     in the same order.

     David restarted the system, and started just the Accounts Payable
     program.  It would take a couple of hours,  but at least it would
     get done.  Noticing the coffee had cooled, he swallowed the whole
     cup at one gulp.  David stood up and walked around the desks.  As
     he passed the cubicle near the door, he saw a high-heeled shoe on
     the floor. Stepping into the cubicle he saw Carol's body sprawled
     on  the  floor.  A touch to the neck told him  she  was  dead--no
     pulse,  and  her  flesh was cooling.  The handle of  a  shattered
     coffee  mug was still held in the fingers.  Pieces had  scattered
     across  the floor under the partition.  On the table next to  the
     body  was a note,  addressed to him.  David was starting to  feel
     numb.  She had despaired over the computer and other problems and
     put  poison in her own coffee pot.  He reached for the phone  but
     ended  up  shivering on the floor.  As he felt the coldness  wash
     over him, he put his arms around Carol's body and hugged her.

              Everything You Wanted to Know About QNEWUSER.BBS
                           but etc., etc., etc...

     The following is an excerpt of a  message  I  received  from  Gee
     Wong, IBM HELP, 1/100, when I asked him to give me the lowdown on
     the use of QNEWUSER in a semi-private system (/p option in Fido).

     QNEWUSER.BBS  is  a questionaire file that Fido uses to query new
     users  on  a  Fido  being  operated  in  the  semi-private  mode.
     QNEWUSER  can  be  used  to display text and/or ask questions and
     follows the language format  detailed  in  the  Fido  manual  for
     creating  a questionaire (QUESTION.BBS).  As the new user answers
     the questions posed by QNEWUSER.BBS, Fido creates a corresponding
     text file called ANEWUSER.BBS.  ANEWUSER can  then  be  used  for
     verification  or  record-keeping  purposes  by the Sysop.  Like a
     QUESTION.BBS questionaire,  QNEWUSER cannot be aborted by the new
     user with Control-C or Control-K, so a Control-B at the beginning
     of  the  file  is not necessary to prevent the user from skipping
     what you WANT him/her to read and answer.

     The following is the gist of the answer I received:

     From: Gee Wong on 107/312, Dance Studio, East Brunswick, NJ

     As for your question on QNEWUSER.  If you use QNEWUSER, Fido will
     perform the following during logon for a new user:

         1) prompt user for name
         2) display contents of NEWUSER1.BBS if this file exists
         3) ask user to pick a password
         4) display the contents of QNEWUSER.BBS and prompt

     The asterisk in the first line  appends  the  user  name  to  the
     ANEWUSER file information.  Within the confines of the prompt and
     question structure,  you can configure the display  to  your  own
     taste.  All  of  the  text  lines without a '/' or '+' or '?' are
     output,  as  is,  to  the  user  when  Fido  puts  him  into  the
     questionaire.  Lines preceeded by a '/' stop the questionaire and
     wait for input or <cr> from the user (note:  line noise can  play
     havoc  with this process and may cause some prompts to be skipped
     without user intervention.).  Lines preceeded by a '+' set  up  a
     multiple   choice  condition.   The  number  following  the  plus
     indicates how many choices  will  be  offered.  The  last  choice
     listed,  when  selected by the user,  prompts Fido to display the
     contents of the line preceeded by the  '?'  and  waits  for  user
     input.  Thus, the LAST choice listed is the one you are trying to
     get amplification  of;  the  other  choices  are  listed  in  the
     ANEWUSER  file but ignored for purposes of user input.  Make SURE
     you list the point you want  more  information  on  as  the  LAST
     choice in that line.

     The  QNEWUSER.BBS  can  be  as  long  or  as  short  as you like.
     Experiment.

     I hope this helps those of you doing it  the  hard  way  (like  I
     was).  Many thanks to Gee Wong for the advice and assistance.

                               Computer worms
                               --------------

     After seeing two boards in my  net  getting  destroyed  by  those
     nasty programs called WORMS, or by the nasty people who make it a
     habit  of  crashing boards,  I am getting scared.  All the Sysops
     are asking themselves, "How can I stop my board from being next?"
     Well, hopefully someone will figure it out.

     Some reasonable ways of not getting your board crashed are:

     1) By having a close friend,  who doesn't have a hard  drive  try
        it,  and  test  it out for a while.  After a while,  have them
        give you a report on how things went.

     2) Not bugging the users to upload,  because they usually get  so
        mad at the Sysop,  that they don't want to call anymore.  They
        think it is fun to ruin the board,  and make them  feel  sorry
        for asking for uploads.

     3) Finding out about a file before you run it,  because you never
        know what it may be.  The real  dangers  about  this  is  that
        those  people  that make these programs make it look and sound
        like the real program, and then make it turn against you. This
        can be a slight bit of a problem.

     4) Make your system private,  and only allow close  friends,  and
        people who you know are O.K. to have.

     5) NEVER download from a upload area that hasn't been tested!

     6) Download  all your files to a blank floppy,  and use a program
        that will protect your hard drive from being written to.

     Some not so reasonable ways of not getting crashed are:

     1) Don't bother downloading from other boards.

     2) Don't ask the users to upload files.  Get all the files from a
        close friend who had them a while (Public Domain and Freeware,
        please don't pirate!).

     3) Take down your board,  and throw away anything that has to  do
        with  communications.  This  would  of  course be the ultimate
        thing to do, which I doubt any Sysops would want to do.

     I know that you have all heard this before,  and are saying,  "It
     will  never  happen to me..." But talk to the Sysops whose boards
     got destroyed,  and you will find out the real truth behind  that
     phrase.  I  am  sure you thought about it quite a few times,  but
     have never done anything about it.

     Please make sure you are careful of which files you have, and how
     you use them. And remember this short safety tip.

                  Taking Advantage of Your PC's Hard Disk:
                          Part II, DOS BATch Files

                                Barry Gordon
                      New York Personal Computer, Inc.

     DOS and BATch Files

     Familiarity with DOS is assumed.  However,  it is helpful to  the
     new  user  to include a paragraph or two on BATch files.  The IBM
     PC and DOS work with three different kinds of program or  command
     files:  .EXE,  .COM, and .BAT files.  (BASIC and BASICA work with
     their own .BAS files,  but those are not relevant to the  present
     discussion.)  The .EXE and .COM files give instructions to the PC
     itself.  They are produced by assemblers, compilers, and linkers.
     The .BAT or BATch files are instructions to DOS which you  create
     for  your  own  convenience.  I will discuss a couple of commands
     that you may find convenient in  working  on  your  PC:  the  DOS
     PROMPT command and the PATH command.

     The DOS PROMPT Command

     Just  as  DOS  keeps track of a default disk drive,  it will also
     keep track of each drive's current directory (the  directory  you
     are working in).  Most often,  this directory is the one you tell
     DOS to assume and use when no other is specified.  The DOS prompt
     always has indicated the  default  disk  drive  followed  by  the
     greater-than  symbol:  A>  which  works well for diskette drives.
     With a hard disk,  you will want to know the  directory  you  are
     working  in  (the  current directory) as well.  You can customize
     the prompt to show the current directory  using  the  DOS  PROMPT
     command.  The  command  PROMPT $P$G tells DOS to display the name
     of the current directory whenever  the  prompt  appears  on  your
     screen.  Other,  more elaborate,  prompt variations are possible,
     but $P$G is a useful beginning.

     The DOS PATH Command

     The actual program fetching is accomplished by means of  the  DOS
     PATH  command.  This  command  tells  DOS  where to look for your
     programs (the executable files) when they are not in the  current
     directory.  The overall scheme begins to take shape:  you work in
     the (current) directory containing your data files, and DOS looks
     for the programs you need (in priority sequence)  in  other  sub-
     directories.  Thus,  your  PATH command might look something like
     this:

              PATH C:\anyname1;C:\anyname2;C:\any3

     The PATH command should contain the full  specification  of  each
     sub-directory,  including  the drive designation.  This keeps the
     search path valid even if you should decide to make,  say,  drive
     Fidonews                     Page 17                   7 Jul 1986


     A:  the  default  drive temporarily.  Since the root directory is
     not named, it is not included in the PATH command.

     Of  course,   having  to  enter  all  of  this  PROMPT  and  PATH
     information  each time you turn on your PC can become a nuisance.
     The proper way to handle this is to create special BATch files in
     the root directory that store and execute your commands.

     Creating BATch Files

     The most direct way to create  .BAT  files  is  to  use  the  DOS
     ability  to COPY a file directly from the PC keyboard into a disk
     file:

              COPY CON filename.BAT

     where CON is the  DOS  name  for  the  keyboard,  and  "filename"
     represents  the  name  you wish to give your new BATch file.  You
     enter your file contents,  line  by  line,  ending  with  a  line
     containing  ^Z (Control-Z),  which can be entered by pressing the
     Function Key 6 (F6).  As an alternative (though I don't recommend
     it) you could learn to use EDLIN,  a minimal file  editor,  whose
     chief  virtue  is  its  automatic inclusion with the DOS package.
     For serious work of this kind,  a good file  editor  is  a  great
     help.  The IBM Personal Editor is one of the very best.

     The AUTOEXEC and SETPATH BATch Files

     The  AUTOEXEC.BAT  file  is  executed only at startup (unless you
     specifically enter it),  and contains those commands you wish  to
     enter for your convenience in operating your PC.

     A simple version of an AUTOEXEC.BAT file might look like this:

              DATE
              TIME
              PROMPT $P$G
              PATH C:\anyname1;C:\anyname2;C:\any3

     The  first  thing  you may want to do is to move the PATH command
     from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file and put  it  in  its  own  BATch  file
     called  SETPATH.BAT.  The  AUTOEXEC.BAT  would  have  these  four
     lines:

              DATE
              TIME
              PROMPT $P$G
              SETPATH

     Your SETPATH.BAT file would look like this:

              PATH C:\anyname1;C:\anyname2;C:\any3

     Putting the PATH command in the SETPATH.BAT file lets you  modify
     your  program search path any time you wish,  and then restore it
     by getting into the  root  directory  and  entering  the  SETPATH

                       JOB MARKET RESEARCH - A PRIMER


          For most Americans in the professional and  paraprofessional
     fields,   few  experiences  ever  seem  quite  as  difficult  and
     frustrating as job hunting.  The essential problem, of course, is
     locating suitable opportunities.  For even  today's  "Information
     Age," finding timely and accurate career information has remained
     an   extremely  difficult  problem.   Employment  agencies,   for
     example,  usually have only very incomplete regional information.
     Classified  ads  in  newspapers are another source -- one usually
     relied on very heavily by job seekers -- but this information  is
     also  usually  regional,  as well as incomplete (especially since
     most of the better jobs are never advertised in newspapers).

          Having tried both private and public employment agencies and
     newspaper advertisements -- and presumably, having also exhausted
     their  access  to  information  through  personal  and   business
     contacts  --  many  white-collar job seekers turn to professional
     recruiters (i.e., "headhunters").  Here too,  the result is often
     frustration -- wasted time,  effort,  and usually, a good deal of
     money.  For most job seekers,  such firms provide much advice and
     encouragement and few actual job interviews.

          College students about to graduate -- both from two and four
     year  institutions  --  are  generally  in a much better position
     since they have  their  placement/counseling  offices  to  assist
     them,  though  of  course  alumni usually have access to the same
     services if they choose to  use  them.  But  unfortunately,  most
     students   and  alumni  make  inadequate  use  of  the  resources
     available to them.  There is a tendency  to  view  these  offices
     solely   as   meeting   places   for  interviews  with  corporate
     recruiters.  This is a serious mistake,  for two reasons.  First,
     most  students  will fail to find jobs through campus interviews;
     and second -- perhaps even more important -- most major companies
     do not regard campus interviews as a preferred means  of  contact
     with applicants.  A recent employer survey by The Charoman Group,
     Inc.,  an educational consulting firm, found that only 18 percent
     of major employers believe college placement interviews to be the
     most effective means of contact  with  applicants.  Rather,  most
     companies  preferred that the initial contact be initiated by the
     applicant by means of the most simple and direct method possible:
     a standard resume  and  cover  letter  sent  to  the  appropriate
     official.

          Of  course it remains true that campus interviews -- as well
     as any of the other job hunting methods mentioned  above  --  may
     prove  successful  in  individual cases.  The point is that,  for
     most people,  these methods offer limited prospects  of  success.
     Thus  most  job seekers are well-advised to try another route:  A
     PLANNED,  SYSTEMATIC JOB MARKET RESEARCH EFFORT.  By  this  means
     the  job  seeker  in  effect  takes  the  initiative  in locating
     suitable job openings in his or her field.  Surprisingly,  not  a
     Fidonews                     Page 21                   7 Jul 1986


     great  deal  of time is required -- perhaps twenty hours for most
     people.  And the resources needed for  the  research  effort  are
     available in most college placement or counseling offices, and in
     virtually all of the larger public libraries.

              Now available from Micro Consulting Associates!!

     Public Domain collection - 550+ "ARC"  archives  -  20+  megs  of
     software  and  other  goodies,  and that's "archived" size!  When
     unpacked,  you get approximately 28 megabytes worth of all  kinds
     of  software,  from text editors to games to unprotection schemes
     to communications programs, compilers, interpreters, etc...  Over
     55 DS/DD diskettes!!

     This collection is the result of more than 15 months of intensive
     downloads  from  just  about 150 or more BBS's and other sources,
     all of which have been examined,  indexed and archived  for  your
     convenience.  Starting  a  Bulletin Board System?  Want to add on
     to your software base without spending thousands of dollars? This
     is the answer!!!

     To order the library,  send  $100  (personal  or  company  check,
     postal money order or company purchase order) to:

                    Micro Consulting Associates, Fido 103/511
                    Post Office Box 4296
                    200-1/2 E. Balboa Boulevard
                    Balboa, Ca. 92661-4296

     Please allow 3 weeks for delivery of your order.

     Note:  No  profit  is  made  from  the  sale of the Public Domain
     software in this collection.  The price is  applied  entirely  to
     the  cost  of  downloading  the  software  over  the phone lines,
     running a  BBS  to  receive  file  submissions,  and  inspecting,
     cataloguing, archiving and maintaining the files.  Obtaining this
     software yourself through the use of  a  computer  with  a  modem
     using  commercial phone access would cost you much more than what
     we charge for the service...

     Please specify what type of format you would like the disks to be
     prepared on.  The following choices are available:
           - IBM PC-DOS Backup utility
           - Zenith MS-DOS 2.11 Backup Utility
           - DSBackup
           - Fastback
           - ACS INTRCPT 720k format
           - Plain  ol' files (add $50)

     Add $30 if you want  the  library  on  1.2  meg  AT  disks  (more
     expensive  disks).  There  are  no  shipping or handling charges.
     California residents add 6% tax.

     For each sale, $10 will go to the FidoNet Administrators.

                      Changing of the Guard in Net 135

     Metro-Fire Fido is now the Net Coordinator and Host for Net  135,
     S-FLorida  Net  (previously Greater Miami Area).  This change was
     effective in Nodelist.164. Many systems are still using Nodelists
     prior to 164 and are having difficulty  sending  traffic  to  Net
     135.  If  you are not up on Nodelist.164 or later,  please go out
     and get one.

     Metro-Fire Fido is 135/14 (135/0) at 305-596-8611,  Miami_FL,  if
     you want to edit your Nodelist.BBS manually.
