        Publisher:              Fido 107/7
        Chief Procrastinator:   Thom Henderson

        Fidonews is published weekly by SEAboard,  Fido  107/7.  You 
        are   encouraged  to  submit  articles  for  publication  in 
        Fidonews.  Article submission standards are contained in the 
        file FIDONEWS.DOC, available from Fido 107/7.  

        Disclaimer or don't-blame-us: 

        The contents of the articles  contained  here  are  not  our 
        responsibility,  nor  do  we  necessarily  agree  with them; 
        everything here is subject to debate.  We publish EVERYTHING 
        received.  





                               How We Do This

        I've been getting questions lately about how Fidonews is 
        created.  I know I've explained this before, but perhaps I'd 
        better go through it again for the benefit of our newer 
        readers.

        Everything in Fidonews is written by you, our readers.  I 
        generally try to cobble up an editorial for each issue, but 
        everything else is submitted by readers.

        You write an article (or a want ad, or a notice, or 
        whatever) on your own system using your own text editor and 
        netmail it to us at node 107/7.  After mail hour each 
        morning an external event moves the files from our input 
        area to a special news area.  Every Monday morning another 
        external event assembles all the articles to make the latest 
        issue, which is then mailed out by Robot to most of the 
        major inbound hosts.  The whole point of this somewhat 
        roundabout process is to make sure that the news goes out 
        every Monday morning without fail.

        There are a bunch of technical specs that an article has to 







FIDONEWS     --           09 Sep 85  15:25:54           Page 2

        meet before it goes into the news.  These are summed up in 
        detail in the file FIDONEWS.DOC, which is available from 
        node 107/7 (and probably many other places -- we've mailed 
        it out many times).  Most of these can be summed up in a few 
        statements:

        1) Flush left margin (we do the indenting here).

        2) Right margin at column 60 or less.  Less is tolerable, 
           but more is not.

        3) No funny characters.  Not everybody has a graphics 
           character set.  (Not everybody has an IBM.)

        You also have to name your file properly.  Our system 
        detects news items by the filename extensions, like so:

            .ART      An article
            .SAL      A "For Sale" ad
            .WAN      A "Wanted" ad

        Most submissions are articles, which can get very long.  Ads 
        can't get very big, but they really shouldn't anyway.  A few 
        folks have sent us very long ads that were thinly disguised 
        as articles, but feedback received to date indicates that 
        that tends to backfire on the advertiser.  Our readers seem 
        to feel cheated when they work their way through some 
        lengthy article just to find that it's really a pitch for a 
        product.  The U.S. Robotics ad for the Courier 2400 was 
        probably the best ad anyone has ever sent us.  It was cute, 
        catchy, flashy, and short.

        One last point, and I'll let you get back to reading the 
        news. Fidonews, like Fidonet itself, is growing by leaps and 
        bounds.  We now have an estimated 30,000 readers.  Fidonews 
        is YOUR way of reaching your fellow users, and they want to 
        hear from you.

        ============================================================
        WARNING WARNING BURNOUT OCCURING!!!!

        Well thats just bout how I feel at the
        moment,  I have seem to have burned out on
        the idea of bbs and telecomunications!  I
        used to use my pc everyday now it seems to be
        every other day and latley once a weak!  I'm
        not really sure what is going on either.
        After sitting infront of the pc for ten
        minutes I start to get sick and looking at it
        makes me feel, oh,  depressed.  (sigh) Maybe
        it has to do with the fact school starts for
        me on the 4th or maybe the fact that I'm
        heart broken? Who knows.  It seems that
        nothing I do with the computer makes me feel
        good.  I need a good challenge at the moment.
        Something that will be interesting but not to
        bland.  I think I should stop using it for a
        week or two and see what happens.  I had
        planned to put up a board at one time but
        couldn't because I lack the money for a phone
        line and my parents permission (sigh again)
        hmm one of these days I will get my own
        computer or, my parents will get another one
        (right) and I will finaly get to put up my
        own Fido!!

                           Rives Mc Ginley, N1BIQ
                                    and
                             Luck Hurder, KY1T
                     Both on Node 105/Net 101(MassNet)

             There is nothing that tickles our hearts better than to 
        wake up in the morning,  put on the coffee,  and snuggle up 
        to Fido to see what has come in via FidoMail from anywhere 
        in the Country and the World.

             The only thing better, we shouldn't talk about,  except 
        it relates to the purpose of this article. We are talking 
        about Amateur Radio.  It seemed to us that with the flexibi-
        lity of Fido, and the vastness of the network,  perhaps we 
        can help Amateur Radio and FidoMail increase usage or 
        traffic if you will.

             Amateur Radio has been sending "Traffic" or telegrams 
        around the world since before 1920. The Traffic handlers, 
        are dedicated, persistant in getting the message through, 
        and at the moment feeling a little underworked.

             So why can't we of the Fido persuasion, gather some 
        business so to speak for the Amateur Radio Traffic nets?  
        The answer is that we can, and quite cheaply. 

             All we need to do is to aquaint our Fido users about 
        the Amateur Radio service, and they will slowly over time 
        use it.  You see the reason is that the service is free.  

                               YES ---- FREE

             The only "cost" is making the FidoMail call to Node 
        #105 in Net 101(MassNet), and leaving a message for Luck 
        Hurder, KY1T.  He will then in his amazing morse code "fist" 
        transmit the message to the radio traffic network, and the 
        message will be delivered as soon as possible, by telephone 
        to the addressee. 

             Amateur Radio has been a wonder of modern electronics 
        for all these years, why not have Fido, the new front-
        runner, add Amateur radio to the list of its services.  
        After all Amateur Radio can do one thing Fido can't.....de
        liver a message to someone who does not have a computer,  
        and do it for FREE.

             Ah ha you say, what is the long list of qualifications 
        that will keep this idea from being useful?  Well.....
        there is only one.

             Any message sent by FidoGram, must be only personal, no 
        business use at all.  If judged as business use, the Amateur

        Radio operator passing the traffic will not handle the 
        message. It will lanquish in the round file.

             So what do you think?  Is this a reasonable addition to 
        Fido?

             If so send FidoMail to Node #105/Net #101  and by 
        return FidoMail as well as by FidoGram you will get details 
        to you for posting on your Fido. We think this is a fun 
        activity,  we are prepared to alert the Amateur Radio 
        Community and its Media about it,  and we think it provides 
        a free public service that Fido can benefit from.

        From: Jim Lynn, Sysop 129/0,129/384 
        Subject: Rewrite of FIDO Documentation

        We here in the Pitt-Net  in  Pittsburg  are  attempting  the 
        rewrite  of the infamous FIDO Sysop and User Manuals.  After 
        a month of sorting out the original source files from TJ, we 
        are starting on the rewrite process.  

        This is a plea for information....  If  you  know  something 
        that is wrong about the manuals,  even though you think that 
        there must be thousands of other users or operators who  are 
        aware  of  the problem,  send a FIDO-GRAM to me at 129/0!!!!  
        If everyone thinks that everyone else will let us know about 
        a bug,  then it will be up to us to find  and  correct  them 
        all.  

        If  you  have  something  that  you  think  should be in the 
        manuals,  drop us a line also.  One  section  that  will  be 
        added  is a hints and usage section where shortcuts and pit-
        falls will be documented.  

        The finished manuals will be distributed as follows: 

                 USERMNAL.ARC The user's guide to happiness.
                 SYSMANAL.ARC The light in the dark for sysops.

            Both ARC's will include a program which  will  take  any 
            released updates and automatically incorporate them into 
            the  manuals,  adding  the update number and date on the 
            fly-leaf page.  This  will  allow  for  downloading  the 
            manuals  once  and from that point on,  only downloading 
            update and correction files. If any one has any thoughts 
            on this before the software  gets  too  "firm",  drop  a 
            line.  

        As a last word,  remember:  this is your manual, you have to 
        use them and your users have to  use  them  to  access  your 
        system  and the new sysops in your area have to rely on them 
        to get up and running.  Please take  an  interest  and  help 
        with a msg or bit of information.

                        ANNOUNCING THE FIRST EVER

                             BULLETIN BOARD

                        THAT IS KIND TO ANIMALS!!


           The KYFHO WILDLIFE BBS is a public service board for
        collecting and disseminating information on rehabilitation
        of wildlife and the related concerns of habitat
        preservation and conservation.

           KYFHO WILDLIFE BBS is operated by Bob and PC Hanes of
        Austin, Texas under the auspices of Wildlife Rescue, Inc.,
        Austin.  Basic care information is drawn from the Austin
        WRI Rehabilitation Course Manual and the separate works of
        its members.  The objective of the Board is to provide a
        forum for the exchange of information with other groups
        and individuals regarding rehabilitation techniques, diets
        and problems that may arise from raising orphaned or
        injured wild birds and animals.

           PLEASE NOTE:  The purpose of Wildlife Rescue, a
        non-profit, volunteer organization, and KYFHO is
        successful rehabilitation and RELEASE of wild creatures.
        In no way do we advocate the keeping of wild animals or
        birds as pets.  This is harmful to the animal and can be
        dangerous to human beings.

           KYFHO WILDLIFE is a serious public service board.  The
        sysops will not tolerate abusive or obscene language,
        jokes, sexually-oriented material or religious
        preachments.  We have no public domain software, or hobby
        type use sections on this board.  A listing of the
        information available will be sent upon request.

           If you have a question regarding care of a wild animal
        or bird, or would like to submit material to be added to
        our files for dissemination to other like-minded groups,
        we welcome your participation.  We will attempt to answer
        all questions received over FIDONET on the next mail
        period after receipt.  Emergency care information is
        available on the voice line as listed below.

           You can do us and the animals in your area a favor by
        providing this information to any group or organization in
        your area who would be interested.  It might even generate
        some net traffic for your board.

                          BULLETIN BOARD ETTIQUETTE
                        FOR NEW USERS AND OLD TIMERS


                Bulletin board etiquette is really no big deal, and 
        I hope you don't get the impression that I'm trying to make 
        an issue out of nothing.  This is nothing more than an 
        introduction to the ins and outs of figuring out just how 
        the hell you have fun on a bulletin board.  

                Of course, you probably figured out most of it, or 
        you wouldn't be reading this article.  

                Last but not least, this is merely my opinion, of 
        which I have more than my share.  


                In the dark ages of modems (pre-1982 or so) there 
        were so few bulletin boards and users that there basically 
        wasn't a problem.  You somehow managed to get a modem 
        (usually a set of ear muffs for your telephone handset; 
        autodialers?  You must be kidding!) got a bulletin board 
        number from a friend, and started dialing.  You got nervous 
        and made a mess of the message base, and if you were real 
        unlucky, crashed the board.  Everyone knew you were "new", 
        and so were tolerant while you learned how to get around.  
        Crashers and trashers weren't really a problem, since most 
        modem users were more or less hardcore techie types, and 
        that was the reason for the things in the first place.  

                These days, Hayes is probably selling more modems 
        per month than were sold total to us hobbiests in 1982.  
        Many are "non business" use, ie. the little sucker you are 
        using right now.  Instead of a trickle of new users, it's a 
        torrential downpour.  New users outnumber old timers on many 
        boards, and that fact probably won't change.  Nor would it 
        even be desireable!  Modem users are getting more and more 
        diversified in their interests, things like specialty boards 
        can now get enough support to be viable.  Enough tech boards 
        already!  

                With the good comes some small problems; the 
        previous "hack at it 'till you get it right" attitude 
        doesn't work on today's overloaded boards that might handle 
        50 or more calls a day.  For example, Fido 125/1 gets about 
        200 new callers per week.  

                A person who uses a modem for the first time 
        generally has no idea of what a bulletin board is like; that 
        is part of the fun!  There are thousands of boards, on 
        almost any subject, each run by an individual with their own 
        personality and ideas.

                Unfortunately, it frequently becomes a situation 
        like a traveler to a foreign country who is totally 
        unfamiliar with local customs.  Visitors embarrass 
        themselves by saying the wrong thing, or insult the locals 
        with totally inappropriate reactions.  Definitely not the 
        way to get the locals to show you around and have a good 
        time.  



                The purpose of this thing is not to presumptuously 
        teach you right from wrong, but to introduce you to one 
        version of "etiquette", or how to get around bulletin boards 
        minimizing damage.  No attempt will be made to tell you how 
        to run the bulletin board program or your telecom program.  
        There are too many different ones anyways, and help is 
        available for that.  



                In face to face encounters with people that you 
        don't know well, there are thousands of "unwritten rules" 
        that just about everyone follows.  Things like not 
        interrupting a conversation, not asking questions that were 
        just answered, minimizing rude noises, nose picking, not 
        commenting on personal subjects not under discussion, etc.  
        The more important ones seem to get even more obscure.  

                A big problem with modeming is that you miss all 
        non-verbal communication details; eye motion, facial 
        expressions, and other cues that help convey otherwise 
        difficult or embarrassing information.  You have to make up 
        for this in other ways.  Since 99.99% of all BBS contents is 
        text, read everything you can find.  

                About the only hard and fast rule of BBSing is READ 
        READ READ READ!!!  You cannot read too much; read as many 
        messages as you can, read the bulletins, read notices.  
        Don't worry about memorizing the contents, just get familiar 
        with what the system is like.  After you do this on a half 
        dozen systems you will have a better idea of what the "real 
        world" (sic) looks like.  

                Get an idea of what kind of people are typing 
        things, and a feel for how "touchy" the crowd there is.  
        People tend to congregate where the find similar sorts; you 
        may end up on a board populated with grouches, because more 
        open people left long ago for a friendlier place.  Or, you 
        may have run into that friendly place.  

                Bulletin boards are no different than a local bar or 
        whatever; a particular crowd develops, you just have to 
        choose where you hang out.  You may be comfortable in a VFW 
        Hall, or maybe at the corner of Pine and Polk.  Don't get 
        mad at the people who you do find, just find a more 
        compatible crowd.

                If you find a message or two you want to reply to, 
        see if it has any replies already.  This will save the 
        embarassment of entering a long tedious message answering a 
        question that was answered months ago.  People are peculiar 
        animals; remember that you are a newcomer.  This is no 
        different than joining a conversation at a party or cafe; 
        you just can't jump in and blaze away with your wit, unless 
        of course that's whats happening at the moment, otherwise 
        it's the "excuse-me-I-have-to-go-to-the-bathroom"-then-leave 
        situation.  Not pleasant.  

                Keep in mind that some things that are wonderful 
        person to person can be absolute disasters in print.  
        Sarcasm for instance.  A simple expression like "You jerk!" 
        is nothing but an insult when they can't see the smile on 
        your face.  A reply to a question, such as "Who knows?  Why 
        don't you look it up?" is also an insult when you can't see 
        the head scratching, foot tapping and other things that 
        would tell the person that you had thought for a few minutes 
        before replying.  

                Just keep in mind that bulletin board messages are 
        like someone speaking in a monotone, with no pauses between 
        words, behind a black curtain, recorded on video tape a week 
        ago, and played on an out of focus black and white TV set 
        with a dirty screen.  From across the street.  

                The majority of boards remain technically oriented; 
        by sheer numbers CP/M and IBM PC dominate (I think, who 
        knows?), but TRS-80 and just about anything else you can 
        think of is out there.  These are not the places to discuss 
        philosophy and tell dirty jokes.  

                There are more and more non-technical boards, which 
        is a good sign.  They are still somewhat limited, but 
        growing extremely fast.  In six months or a year there will 
        be no shortage.  These are not the places to discuss 
        problems with your disk drive.  

                Again, bulletin boards are no different than any 
        other group of people, except the lack of fine detail and 
        the time difference.  

                As to messages, only one suggestion: keep it short.  
        Since long messages scroll off the screen, it's nearly 
        impossible to remember what the 17th question out of 30 was.  

        The poor person answering the message needs an eidetic 
        memory to keep track of it all, and you will usually get a 
        terse response and a "I don't remember the rest".  Better to 
        enter two messages than one huge one.  

                Speaking of time differences, keep in mind that 
        people may call in every day, once a week or maybe never 
        again.  Be patient when waiting for a reply.  After a while, 
        you'll get an idea of who calls in how often, and when you

        can expect a reply.  Don't harrass the guy if you don't see 
        a reply when you'd like to.  Occasionally, people have been 
        known to do things other than BBSing, as hard as it is to 
        believe, and it may take them awhile to get around to 
        checking in.  

                Though I won't go into downloading files here, if 
        you are very new you should get as many lists of other 
        bulletin board systems as you can.  Most are just text, so 
        you should be able to download or "capture" them on whatever 
        you are using to call with.  There are enough BBS's these 
        days that you should have many to choose from, within your 
        local calling area.  



                No, I haven't forgotten the sysop.  The sysop is the 
        troll who happens to own the machine you are playing with.  
        Most sysops are very strange people.  Who else would do 
        something like run a bulletin board?  

                Depending on the person running the board you're on, 
        the sysop may be involved on a daily basis or not at all.  
        He may be standoffish, or run a tight ship, breathing down 
        your neck.  Be reasonable in making requests of the sysop.  
        Usually there is no problem, but remember that after a 
        while, running a BBS can get to be a drag (first hand 
        observation here) and the sysop may be "on vacation".  
        Getting angry at the sysop for not answering like you want 
        him to is not the thing to do.  Most bulletin boards are run 
        as a hobby, and take a back seat to the sysop's real life.  

                Personally, my involvement on Fido #1 varies from 
        every day to once a month on and off.  The more outside 
        things I have to do or want to do, the more I ignore Fido.  
        Also, if I know there are ten thousand questions awaiting 
        me, I tend to avoid checking in.  Sometimes I just want to 
        do nothing at all, so that's exactly what I do.  

                Also, again, remember that there is a human out 
        there somewhere.  Sysops are saints and assholes like 
        everyone else, and they have the responsibility of keeping 
        the system up and running.  Getting angry at the sysop for 
        not answering a request as quickly or as thoroughly as you 
        want is definitely not the way to get in good graces on that 
        board.  

                Belaboring a point, (almost the end of the article 
        anyway, just hang on) the only thing that makes a board 
        interesting is the people who call it.  I hope I didn't 
        discourage you from taking part in the madness on a board; 
        really, do just the opposite.  Most people who peruse the 
        message bases are looking for interesting people to "type" 
        to, so if you have anything to say, even nothing, say it!  
        Most conversations start with "hello".

                A good point was brought up by Dean Gengle (sp?) of 
        Communitree in an article in Dr. Dobbs Journal (June 85 I 
        think).  Bulletin boards are not necessarily the totally 
        anonymous things you may assume they are.  Usually 
        everything you see on your screen is also displayed on the 
        bulletin board computer's screen; even messages you decided 
        not to save.  This may not be important, but is something to 
        keep in mind.

                    BBS Laws and the Moral Majority
                          By David Wollmann

                I have been doing my best to keep up with the BBS 
        Law updates that are being circulated, and let me state 
        that I agree, we must do our best to state our case, that
        Remote Bulletin Board Systems are a valid and important
        facility in our society.  Not only are they important 
        because they offer us the opportunity to expand our 
        computing skills and abilities, but also because they 
        enable us to express ourselves freely and at little
        expense to such a large and widely diverse a group of 
        people.

                The news has recently featured reports of certain
        groups of individuals using BBS's for their own unlawful, 
        and immoral purposes.  The abuses have been highlighted, 
        rather that the benefits. This kind of 
        `mis-information' tends to cause the public to develop a
        prejudiced sentiment towards the subject matter, since
        most of us are forced to rely on the media for 
        information from which we unavoidably and inevitably draw
        conclusions as to the morality, if you will, of a given 
        subject or situation.

                The aspect of this situation that I would like to 
        concentrate on now is the involvment of the Conservative
        element of our population, of which I am a member as I am
        sure are many of yourselves.

                The abuses of BBS's which have been reported most 
        frequently seem to be those involving a BBS that was for
        the use of pedophiles (child molestors).  This is a 
        subject that strikes close to the heart of all of us, and
        is of great concern to the membership and supporters of the
        Moral Majority.  In a nutshell, rather than becoming 
        upset with the Moral Majority, let's do our best to educate
        them along with the rest of our nation, as to the benefits
        that BBS's carry with them.  Why not point out to them how
        much a Fido BBS could do for their communications?  How 
        great an impact they might effect through a BBS in their 
        community, and in fact, the U.S. as a whole?  If the Moral
        Majority is interested in making changes for the better, 
        and I believe they are, surely they will be quick to `go to
        bat for us' once they too see the potential for good in a
        BBS.  Why not suggest to them that they get involved and 
        help them set up a Fido System of their own?  

                If no great General has said it, he should have,
        "Don't make an enemy out of someone if you can make him
        your friend with a few kind words."

        Fido    125/77


                             PC Pursuit and Fido


             Mention  has  been  made  in previous issues of Fidonews 
        about the flat-rate long distance service  from  GTE  Telenet 
        called  PC-Pursuit.  It  uses a ringback scheme,  which makes 
        sense  from  GTE's  point  of  view,   but  makes  it  pretty 
        unacceptable  for  Fidomail.  It  has  a great potential as a 
        side method of transferring files, however, and could be very 
        valuable in getting things like  the  nodelist  and  Fidonews 
        distributed   more   widely  and  cheaply  than  at  present.  
        Following is a message to Tom Jennings on Fido #1  discussing 
        it.  

                                --******--

             The ringback and menu rigamarole can take from  1  to  4 
        minutes.  Not too awfully bad for a connect, but a real waste 
        for  a  busy.  Only reasonable way to use it is with a script 
        file to answer the prompts and do the waiting  while  you  do 
        something   else.   I'm   surprised   they're  not  targeting 
        individuals & small businesses that presently send stuff  via 
        MCI Mail, etc that could be done with Pursuit instead.  
         
             The 11 cities besides San Francisco are:
          
               Atlanta      Denver      New York
               Boston       Detroit     Philadelphia
               Chicago      Houston     Wash D.C.
               Dallas       L. A.
         
             Unfortunately,  it's one area code per city, so New York 
        means 212,  even though half the city is 718.  Ditto for  the 
        LA  area.  Even at that,  all that's necessary is to ship new 
        stuff to one or two nodes in each area.  Ideally,  they would 
        be  volunteers  that  would mail the files to all local nodes 
        and ideally they'd be different nodes than the  already  busy 
        hosts.  What  I'll  do is send a copy of this msg to Fidonews 
        and see if there is any interest in doing it.  Main thing  is 
        to do it without putting any additional work on you or any of 
        the hosts.

                                  --******--


             Anyone  using PC-Pursuit,  or anyone in one of the above 
        cities that is willing to receive files and pass them  on  to 
        local Fidos,  please send a message to Harvey Nehgila on Fido 
        125/77.  If your system doesn't recognize that  node,  you're 
        dealing with an outdated nodelist, and that's the very reason 
        for  setting  up  a  distribution net for updates!  (Use node

        125/1 if 125/77 is not yet on  your  list).  Volunteers  need 
        not  necessarily  be  running  a  Fido  themselves,   but  an 
        autoanswer modem and a host program that will receive  XMODEM 
        uploads are required.  
         
             With  minimal  time  from  a few volunteers,  we can use 
        Pursuit to make the latest version of Fidofiles available  to 
        all the nodes for little or no expense.  The nodelist and the 
        newsletter  are  the  two  things  that tie the net together.  
        It'd be very nice if as many nodes as possible were using the 
        latest versions.  Timely distribution of updates of Fido  and 
        associated utilities could also be accomplished with Pursuit.  
        Any takers?

                    Bug in Newly Released RENUM Program

                                    by
                               Bob Hartman
                              Sysop 101/101


                Recently I sent the new program RENUM (in the file
        RENUM.ARC) to all host nodes in the FidoNet.  This program
        was a replacement for Tom Jennings' original version of
        RENUM which would not renumber the user list when it was
        finished renumbering the messages.  Unfortunately the
        version of RENUM distributed has one minor bug in it.  This
        bug causes the user list renumbering to be off by (usually)
        one message.  Fortunately, it is off on the low side, and
        the worst that happens is that a user reads a message twice.
        This problem has been corrected in version 1.3 which is
        available for download from my Fido.  If you are using this
        program and would like to update it, either call my board
        and download it, or send me FidoNet mail, and I will send
        you the latest version.

                 An Update on the Current State of Rover
                           by  Bob Hartman

        First of all, the standard introduction to "what is Rover?"
        Well, Rovermsg is a standalone Fido Message Base system.
        It is usually run by the sysop of a Fido system from the
        console (or remotely via the '0' command).

        It is exactly like Fido with these exceptions:

        1. The E)dit command from the Enter-Msg menu.
           If for message editing, you wish to use a standard editor
           that creates an ASCII text file (rather than a standard
           word processor file that has special types of characters
           in it), use the -e option for ROVERMSG.
        2.  The C)hange-Msg command from the Msg: or Edit-Msg menus.
            This option allows a user to edit an already existing
            message, thus avoiding the usual state where a message
            has been saved, and is dead wrong.
        3.  The '!' command available at the NET/NODE prompt when
               entering a RoverNet message.
            This command allows searching for a given string in the
            nodelist.  It is a case-insensitive search, and it will
            look at the node name, city, and phone number.
        4.  The special node names */0 and n/*.
            The first will send a message to all hosts in all nets,
            and the second will send a message to all nodes in net
            #n.
        5.  When replying to messages the subject of the new message
            is automatically formed as 'Re: old-subject'.  The
            subject can be changed with the subJ)ect command.


        Now for the real point of the article:

        I know, I know - I have been really screwing you all up
        with versions of Rovermsg coming out too fast.  Well, I
        tried to delay this one as long as possible, but several
        events arose which made it impossible to delay it any
        longer.  First of all, Fido version 11 will soon be out,
        and the old version of Rovermsg (2.0) will not be
        compatible with it.  Secondly, (for those of you that
        experienced it) I really think that I tracked down the 
        'Goodbye' bug (it was obliging, and happened to hit me when
        I was running a debugging version of Rovermsg).  Thirdly,
        I finally realized why Rovermsg would not run on certain
        non-IBM compatibles.  The reason was that Rovermsg tries
        to change the timer interrupt.  For non-IBM compatibles, 
        this was not the same interrupt number, so when it got
        changed your machine would go south.  If you are not using
        an IBM compatible, please use the '-t 0' option to disable
        the Rovermsg timer.  Finally, the new version is 2.10 and

        it has the above mentioned problems fixed (the fix of using
        '-t 0' on non-IBM's will not work in version 2.0, just 2.1).
        If you call my board to download Rovermsg, you might also
        want to download RENUM.ARC which is a command line driven
        version of the Sysop only 2 and 8 commands.  It is smarter
        than the original RENUM written by Tom Jennings in that it
        does in fact renumber the user list, and it can be used to 
        delete old or received messages.  I run it as an external
        event once a week to clear old messages from my board.
         
        If you are a Fido Sysop that uses Rovermsg, please send me
        a FidoNet message so that I can add you to my master Rover
        mailing list.  I know that there are at least 25-30 sysops
        that user Rovermsg, and I only have about 115 in my master
        list.  Also, please download the latest version from my
        board so that you don't get bitten by bugs that have been
        fixed.  I placed this article in the FidoNews just so that
        all of you would see it and therefore not have the excuse
        that you did not know that you were supposed to send my a
        FidoNet message if you are a Rovermsg user.
