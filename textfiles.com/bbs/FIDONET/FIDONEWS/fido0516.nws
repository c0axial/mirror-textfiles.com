                     IN SEARCH OF A DEMOCRATIC FIDONET


       As  I  was  reading Steven Hoskin's most recent column  in  the
     FidoNews, a thought occurred to me. Perhaps you will not think it
     a good thought,  but here it is,  and you can  form any  opinions
     you like.  Steven discussed in his article the methods  by  which
     IFNA,  as  the corporate manager of the FidoNet,   could set up a
     system where "grunt SysOps" could vote  on  issues.  The problem,
     as he mentioned,  was that SysOps didn't all belong to IFNA,  and
     hence  could not,  at present,  vote.   He  also  mentioned  that
     nobody should ever have to PAY to vote.
       Amid all the flames,   counterflames,  et alia dealing with the
     proposal   to   disincorporate  IFNA  by  Randy   Edwards,    and
     counterproposals  to the effect of IFNA no longer  governing  the
     FidoNet,  but instead acting as the representative of ALL FidoNet
     compatible networks,  I have yet another  suggestion to make.
       I  hereby propose that IFNA is a necessary administrator of the
     FidoNet,   and  has  every reason to exist,   for without  it  we
     would  surely  fall  apart.   But  I  further  propose  that   no
     representative   of   a  FREE network should have   a   FEE   for
     membership.   In   other   words,   IFNA Membership should be   a
     RIGHT   granted  to ALL FidoNet SysOps.   IFNA is  a   non-profit
     organization  to start with,   so this should not be as big of  a
     deal as it seems...
       Anticipating the answers to this proposal,  yes,  we  will have
     to   work out a new means by which IFNA raises capital   to  fund
     itself.  Some  possibilities include:  Voluntary donations  (tax-
     deductible,  hopefully),   Sales of  modems  (if  a suitable deal
     with USR, for instance, can be worked out...), or any suggestions
     that you (readers of this) might have.
       If  you feel a comment to this article is in order,  so long as
     it is not a flame,  I can be reached by NetMail  between 11pm and
     8am.   I  will be 24hrs within a number of weeks,  but am not  at
     time of writing.

                     12 Ways to Kill An Association

     No one individual sabotages a community association
     intentionally.  But a glance at this list might reveal ways to
     work against an association's best interests without being aware
     of it.

     1. Don't come to meetings. If you do come, be late.

     2. If you attend, find fault with the work of others.

     3. Never run for the board--it's easier to criticize.

     4. Be angry if you're not appointed to a committee.

     5. If  you're asked  your opinion,  say nothing.  Afterward, tell
     everyne how things should have been.

     6. Do no  more than necessary. If a few  persons work tirelessly,
     complain that the association is run by a clique.

     7. Don't bother to help get new members involved.

     8. Don't  tell board  members how  they can  help you  or achieve
     certain goals--but if they don't, quit participating.

     9. When attending a meeting, vote  for one thing, and then forget
     about it after you get home.

     10. Agree to everything at the meeting--disagree later.

     11. Take  all the  benefits your association  provides--but don't
     make a personal contribution.

     12. Talk about cooperation, but don't practice it.

                             NOW FIDONEWS TOO

                               by Dot Falcon
                        Co-sysop, The Falcon's Rock
                              Opus 1:109/648
                             College Park, MD


     The endless complaining and debating that has ruined the SYSOP and
     IFNA echoes has now reached FidoNews too.  Recent issues (even the
     editorials) contain a daunting quantity of debate about who should
     do what, and why.

     Normally, endless griping is a symptom of unresolved problems.
     I'm a person who likes to speak plainly, and I offer here, in the
     interest of resolving three major issues, what I consider to be
     some plain truths.

     1.   What is IFNA's function?  This can be debated forever,
          because I believe IFNA has no function.  In my opinion, it
          was formed because some people decided to collect money and
          didn't feel right about doing it without some official
          sanction, so they formed a corporation.  Dissolve IFNA.  Stop
          collecting money.  Let the nodelist, FidoNews, and anything
          else be distributed by those who feel like it.  That's how it
          was in the old days so many of you would like to bring back,
          wasn't it?

     2.   What to do about all those new nets forming?  You folks sound
          like AT&T when MCI and Sprint came on the scene.  Just relax,
          relinquish your monopoly, and enjoy the new abundance.

     3.   What to do about all the flaming?  My personal plan of action
          is to remove myself from those situations which involve
          humans who can't make themselves palatable to others.
          Obviously, a lot of people have already made that decision
          about FidoNet.  Those of you who are still out there
          bemoaning what's become of the net, do something.  If you
          can't make things better, consider going elsewhere.  Take
          action instead of complaining, and you'll stop being part of
          the problem.

     Those of you who still have problems after reading this, do
     something.  Do anything.  But please stop the endless debating and
     recommending, and especially, stop griping.

     ------------------------------------
     FidoCon'88 is closer than you think!
     ------------------------------------

     Despite all of the net rumblings, FidoCon'88 in Cincinnati is
     attracting more attention than ever before.  Already
     registrations are coming in.  People in the net seem to be almost
     as excited about this year's conference as we are.  Just think,
     here is the opportunity to meet with fellow SYSOPs you have been
     chatting with for years.  A chance to meet face to face with
     friends and flamers alike.

     FidoCon also provides an opportunity to meet face to face with
     vendors important to sysops such as: drive manufacturers, modem
     manufacturers, common carriers (like AT&T),  software companies
     and more.  We are asking the vendors not to bring just sales
     people, but technical people that can answers YOUR tough
     questions.

     Cincinnati will also provide interesting conferences with topics
     you want to here about and panel discussions for you to
     participate in.  We will be reviewing products, talking about
     standards, new technology, and even fun stuff like net politics.

     Probably the most important thing about FidoCon is fellowship.
     All of us in the net have a common bond.  We may not always
     agree, but in the end we share similar goals and experiences.
     There will be plenty of 'quiet time' to strengthen and renew
     these ties.  You'll be surprised how reasonable some people can
     be when you meet them in person.

     August is closer than you think.  The conference dates are August
     25th - 28th (well really August 24th - 28th, registration will
     start Wednesday afternoon and there will be a reception that
     night.  All are welcome).  For more information contact Rick
     Ashworth at 1/88 (our special FidoCon'88 node).  You can file
     request 'REGISTER' from 1/88 or most net 108 boards for the
     latest registration information packet.

     We are still looking for more ideas for speakers and topics.  If
     you have an idea for a topic or would like to speak at FidoCon,
     contact Mark Walker at 108/50.

     Don't forget about the US Robotics special offer!  The first 50
     people to register for the conference will receive a coupon for
     $50 off the price of an HST 9600 baud modem.  This coupon CAN be
     used with the USR SYSOP offer!  This brings the price of a USR
     HST down to a reasonable $445.00! -> BUT you have to be one of
     the first 50 to register.

     Many SYSOPs have already taken advantage of this special offer,
     so you had better act fast!

     GATEWAY: A System to Exchange E-Mail with Other Systems
     by Daniel Tobias
     1:380/2

       There's been some talk in FidoNews and elsewhere about
     gatewaying mail between FidoNet and various other systems.  This
     idea comes from the desire of many to fully inter-network all E-
     Mail systems so that everybody who uses E-Mail of any sort can
     send mail to anyone else, similarly to how the telephone
     presently operates.  (You don't have to know what local or long
     distance company your friend subscribes to in order to call him.)

        The E-Mail field, as it is now, is terriby Balkanized, with
     numerous different networks (amateur, commercial, institutional,
     etc.) which can't all talk to each other.  While some (like
     commercial E-Mail providers who wish everyone to subscribe to
     their service) may consider it in their interest to keep the
     systems separated, it is in the interest of people who like to
     communicate to break down the walls and let everyone send
     messages to everyone else, whatever service they might use.

        To this end, I am now releasing GATEWAY, a program to enable
     E-Mail gatewaying between Fido/Opus/compatible systems and other
     services.  In particular, I have set up the ability to gateway to
     CompuServe and The Source, but the program is general enough so
     you may be able to use it for other gatewaying as well.

        The way GATEWAY works is by finding messages in your netmail
     area that are properly addressed ("Cis 77777,7777" for CompuServe
     ID 77777,777, for instance), and writing them to text files in a
     standardized format; then, a script file (requiring Datastorm's
     PROCOMM-PLUS to run) logs in to the remote system, sends the
     outbound mail and fetches anything inbound; and then GATEWAY
     takes over again and sticks the incoming messages into the
     netmail area.  (The above address format is the present default;
     should FidoNet ever adopt a standard for internetwork addressing
     as discussed in an earlier FidoNews, I'll modify GATEWAY to use
     addresses of the new standard, whatever it may be.)

        I designed GATEWAY primarily for gatewaying private E-Mail;
     however, by popular demand, I added some features for sending and
     recieving messages for the online forums/SIGS on the commercial
     services.  However, due to copyright considerations, it is not
     recommended you make commercial SIGs accessible to your users;
     but this feature can be helpful in your own personal perusal of
     SIG messages, which you can now do offline on your sysop console
     rather than "while the meter's running" on a commercial service.

        Where private E-Mail is concerned, though, to my knowledge no
     service has claimed copyright to such messages, and I know of
     several people who are operating gateways of such messages into
     and out of CompuServe and its ilk.  Hence, there should be no
     legal problems to setting your board up as a gateway to let your
     users send mail to friends on CompuServe and The Source, and get
     replies back.  Provisions exist to charge the cost of sending and
     receiving messages against the Fido/Opus "credit" value in the
     FidoNews 5-16                Page 7                   18 Apr 1988


     user's record.

        With GATEWAY, combined with some programs from others to
     interlink FidoNet with the UUCP/UseNet network, just about
     everything can be connected with everything else in a great big
     WorldNet, to the furtherance of interpersonal communications.

        GATEWAY, a "shareware" program, is downloadable in the file
     GATE100.ARC (the last three digits will change to reflect the
     version number) from SOFT FIDO at (318) 222-3503; it's in file
     area 6.  Bark and WaZoo file requests (to node 1:380/2) will work
     as well; use GATE???.ARC to be sure you get it even if the
     version changes.

     First,  what  is  HICNet?   HICNet   is  an  acronym  for  Health
     Information by Computer  Network.  This is why  I got involved in
     FidoNet.   With the  advent of  easy  computer access  around the
     world  at  minimal  cost   compared  to  commercial  networks,  I
     envisioned   a  system   where   medical  information   could  be
     disseminated  to  many  individuals  at  a  low-cost.   While the
     medically  related   echos  of   GRAND_ROUNDS,  ABLED,  RECOVERY,
     AIDS/ARC  are   exceptional  as  discussion   areas,  the  HICNet
     Newsletter is for hard news information.

     Each issue comes out on the  Monday of each week and includes the
     latest weekly news from the Centers for Disease Control Morbidity
     and Mortality Weekly Report  (MMWR), Food and Drug Administration
     reports,  news items  from the  Surgeon  General, and  the latest
     information  and statistics  on  AIDS.  We  also  have occasional
     articles  from various  other  medically related  fields  such as
     dentistry and optometry.

     An elaborate distribution system to get the newsletter out around
     the world in a  timely manner has been  developed by Robert Klotz
     at  FidoNet Node  1:19/9.  Robert  is the  worldwide distribution
     coordinator for the newsletter.

     In  my eyes,  this is  a wonderful  use of  the resource  we call
     FidoNet.  The  newsletter has  been in  operation for  almost two
     years  providing  an  education  resource  to  many  individuals,
     augmenting the daily discussions in the echomail areas.

     If you are interested in receiving the newsletter, and wish to be
     on  the  regular  distribution  schedule,  please  contact either
     myself, David Dodell  at 1:114/15 or Robert  Klotz at 1:19/9.  If
     you  would  like a  sampl  of  the newsletter,  the  most current
     version is  available for  file request  from 1:114/15  using the
     keyword HICNEWS.

     All of us here in Cincinnati are trying to make things as easy as
     possible for you to get up to the minute information about the
     conference, therefore we have brought up a special 'Registration'
     node: 1/88.  Right now you can call 1/88 (300-9600 baud - thanks
     to US Robotics for the HST) and get the latest information about
     registration, pricing, agenda, vendors, special events, etc.  The
     registration node will also support file requests with "magic"
     filenames for FidoCon '88 information.  Soon you will even be
     able to register on-line if you plan to use either Visa or
     Mastercard.  Stay tuned for more!

     At this time we are still looking for guest speakers and topics
     of discussion for FidoCon '88.  While no speaker can be of
     interest to everyone, we would like to see a broad range of
     topics discussed.  Remember this is going to be a family event,
     not devoted entirely to the computer user!  We'd be interested in
     hearing your suggestions.  Please send your suggestions to
     Mark Walker at 1:108/50.

     If you have any comments or questions, please send your inquires
     to 1:1/88 or 1:108/62 via Netmail.  Rick Ashworth or Tim
     Sullivan, operating the above nodes respectively, will get back
     to you as soon as possible.
