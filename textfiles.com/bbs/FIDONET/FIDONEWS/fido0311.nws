                           THE FREEDOM TO COMPUTE

                                Mike Guffey

     Professor Loren  Graham  of  M.I.T.  recently  wrote  an  article
     entitled  "The  Kremlin and the Computer".  He depicted life with
     state controlled computing.  His observation that  George  Orwell
     had  it  all backwards in "1984" is shrewd.  He noted that Orwell
     thought technology would allow "Big Brother" to maintain control.
     Who would have guessed the Soviet Union would turn the tables and
     retain control  by  the  suppression  of  technology,  especially
     computer technology?

     If   America's   government  relied  on  keeping  the  population
     uninformed to retain power and control, things would be different
     today.  What if your government didn't permit computer access  to
     large amounts of accurate data,  didn't permit free communication
     between computer users?  What if your government would not  allow
     widespread   use   of  personal  computers  for  fear  of  losing
     "control"?  How long could your government hope to genuinely keep
     pace in the information age?

     These were questions Graham explored in his article.  He  painted
     a  grim  picture of what might be called "retrograde technology".
     He points out some democratic traditions indicating an edge  over
     communist [and third world] nations:

     o A  tradition  of  successful technology developed under private
       ownership and control.

     o Close relationships between creators,  buyers  and  sellers  of
       technology

     o A  tradition  of free access to and creation of massive amounts
       of reliable information about most topics.

     o Excellent communications facilities  necessary  for  access  to
       diverse and far-flung data bases.

     o A tradition of entrepreneurial and innovative freedom .

     Graham   goes  on  to  say,   "So  far  the  pattern  [of  Soviet
     authorities] seems  to  be  to  require  that  all  computers  be
     institutionally  housed  and controlled.  But what [they] may not
     have realized is that they will pay a stiff price...  by severely
     limiting  the rapidity of the growth of the computer culture,  by
     hampering the spread of computer  literacy  among  young  people,
     ...by  watching the West become a true 'information society' they
     will be doomed to follow..." Graham also calls the  Soviet  Union
     "the  most  secretive  industrialized power in the world".  These
     observations are based on  a  recent  visit  to  Moscow  and  his
     background in the history of science.

     There  is  no  known "hacker-culture" in the Soviet Union and its


     Fidonews                     Page 2                   17 Mar 1986





     youth is missing out on the experiences available to millions  of
     American  schoolkids,  hobbyists  and  average  business computer
     users.  Nor does the Soviet Union's educational system  emphasize
     hands-on  experience  with high-technology hardware.  Even typing
     is not widely taught.

     Graham's article raises the question about how  long  the  Soviet
     Union can retain a genuinely international status with a decaying
     economy  that  can  neither heal itself with accurate information
     nor give its children a legacy of competition in an  increasingly
     computer-aided  world.  Surely a disturbing question for an aging
     leadership.

     So what about your most taken-for-granted freedom?  How important
     is it to you?  What are you planning to do to protect it?  Unlike
     the gun control or right-to-life issues,  the freedoms you  enjoy
     in accessing as much (or as little) information as you desire are
     seldom  regarded  as  burning  issues.  Are you to allowing it to
     slip away as the communications giants gradually make  the  price
     of information prohibitive?

     In  earlier  times,  free  enterprise  aviation developed rapidly
     because suffocating regulation had not yet  arrived  and  no  one
     thought  to make air corridors into tollways.  Later,  after long
     years of gradually instituted legislation,  many industry  giants
     couldn't  survive  their  emancipation.  Today  our  situation is
     reversed.  We have started out on overcrowded highways controlled
     by one giant.  Let us hope the giant remains benevolent.  Let  us
     hope  the  giant  doesn't team up with the federal bureaucracy to
     act on our behalf without our consent.


     Just where does one suggest a constitutional amendment?

                             *FIRST (P)REVIEW*

                                  ANIMATOR
                                  --------
                           From Aegis Development
                           ----------------------

     Animator is the first in a series of advanced  graphic  utilities
     to  be released by Aegis Development.  When it is initially sold,
     it will be bundled  with  Images,  their  paint  program  (retail
     $139.95);  this  preview  will  only  be  concerned with Animator
     portion, however, as Images was not received in my review package
     from Aegis.

     Animator can be entered either from Workbench or CLI and, further
     reflecting  Aegis'  commitment  to  fully  utilizing  the   Amiga
     hardware,  one  can  multi-task with this program.  This facility
     will only become useful  when  memory  expansion  above  the  512
     barrier  is  available  -  Animator  leaves free only about 110K,
     which quickly gets eaten away when  you  incorporate  backgrounds
     for  the  animations (a background uses 50K).  Backgrounds are in
     IFF format,  which means Deluxe Paint pictures once saved with  a
     ".PIC" extender can be entered into the program.

     The  power  of  Animator becomes evident at the outset.  The icon
     based "fast menu"  occupies  a  relocatable  window  on  a  blank
     screen.  There  are 29 icons to provide different functions and a
     full  32  color  selection  strip.   The  icons  themselves   are
     moderately  descriptive,  but a very nice touch is an "?" icon to
     describe the other icons;  for example positioning the  "?"  over
     the  small  movie camera icon displays "Replay This Tween" in the
     menu bar at the top of the screen.

     What's a "tween" you say?  Unlike other  animation  programs  for
     personal  computers,  Animator  does  not  just  emulate  a movie
     camera,  working frame by frame,  but rather  uses  the  advanced
     concept  of  the animation segment - the "inbetween." Rather than
     moving a figure step by step,  each  time  advancing  the  frame,
     Animator allows you to move the figure in real time in one tween.
     This  makes for very smooth animation of simple figures (polygons
     are  Animator's  forte)  without  losing  the  benefit  of  frame
     animators, i.e. having changes occur instantly in one frame.

     Animator  allows you to create a variety of simple shapes (lines,
     free form polygons, circles, boxes, or five pointed stars) all of
     which can be either in outline form or filled  with  the  current
     color.  Once  the  object  is  begun,  even a dot is considered a


     Fidonews                     Page 4                   17 Mar 1986





     polygon, you can begin to manipulate it with the other tools.

     Here's a sample session.  You select "make filled polygon" either
     from the fast menu or the menu bar  (under  "Create").  Near  the
     bottom  of  the  screen  click once with the left mouse button to
     start the polygon, click again to make another point and then one
     click of the right button finishes the shape and  brings  up  the
     fast menu.  Click on the still camera icon to advance to the next
     tween.  Pick up the "hook" icon - also found under "Move" menu as
     "morph-hook."  Clicking  once with the left button enables you to
     grab the polygon dot that you've made and extend it.  Stretch  it
     out  to  a straight line;  click with the left to put it down and
     then with the right button to finish the action.  Click on  "next
     tween."  Still using the morph-hook,  grab the center of the line
     and pull straight up; the "line" becomes a triangle!

     Do the left-right two-step and now lets see what we have so  far.
     Click  on  the large movie camera icon ("Replay Whole Strip") and
     the pixel shoots smoothly across the bottom  of  the  screen  and
     then the triangle grows up from that line.  One even flow.

     Now  lets  really  cook.  Choose a different color,  again either
     from the color bar  along  the  fast  menu  window  or  from  the
     slightly  larger  representation  that  drops  down from the main
     color window.  (If you don't  see  one  you  like,  choosing  the
     "palette" icon takes you into a separate color control menu where
     you  can  mix  your  own.)  Along the edge of the triangle on the
     screen, construct another triangle - from dot to line to triangle
     if you like or all at once.  Now we have a pyramid.  Select  next
     tween.  Under the "Move" menu select "Rotate in plane." Under the
     "Select"  menu  choose "All" for all polygons on the screen.  Now
     pick the center around which you wish to rotate the  pyramid  and
     spin  it  this way or that.  Select next tween and "Rotate around
     X." Now spin that pyramid topsy-turvy.  Or choose "Rotate  around
     Y" and the form will spin on a vertical axis.

     There  are  also controls to move the object around the screen by
     grabbing it causing it just to appear there.  Or you can  plot  a
     free form path for your polygon to follow.  You can also move the
     object   toward  or  away  from  the  viewer,   with  or  without
     perspective.

     By using the  "Select"  menu  you  can  "selectively"  choose  to
     manipulate  all  or  any  combination  of  polygons  or  even any
     combination of parts of polygons.  This can lead to  sights  that
     have previously been unimaginable.  Here is where the mind begins
     to boggle.

     By combining actions on a polygon during the same tween,  you can
     achieve beautiful effects.  Try taking your pyramid  on  a  free-
     form  path around the screen while spinning around both the X and
     Y axes.  The program instantly combines all these effect into one
     smooth flowing animation.

     As I began to sense the possibilities of Animator,  I also  began
     to get a little frustrated.  Three out of the four demos provided
     look  so  childish  that  you're  tempted  to  dismiss  the whole
     program.  The promo literature proudly states that all the  demos


     Fidonews                     Page 5                   17 Mar 1986





     "were  made by amateurs." At this stage of the game demos are not
     only what sells software, demos also sell Amigas!

     The save function was disabled on my review copy so I was  unable
     to  try  building  my  own animations beyond a single session.  I
     have been told the released version will  also  have  a  "player"
     program  that  enables  you to play several animations in a loop.
     Also the glowing cursor (color register 31 is constantly  cycling
     from  green  to  purple) will be able to be toggled on or off.  A
     good option.

     One problem I encountered was use of the mouse to grab particular
     polygons or points of  polygons.  This  implementation  seemed  a
     little  shaky  -  although  the problem may be corrected with the
     released version or clarified with the documentation (only a demo
     sheet was supplied with my review copy).

     My only other quibble would be the lack of  any  keyboard  input.
     Animator  is  completely  mouse  driven.  One  of the niceties of
     Electronic Arts' Deluxe Paint  is  the  keyboard  shortcuts  that
     speed you along and allow you to work with a full screen.


     All in all, Animator is a pioneering original, and will influence
     generations of programs for years to come.  Aegis' first entry in
     the Amiga sweepstakes is a real thoroughbred, and promises to be
     a winner.

     Bill Allbritten   11/301

                        Using DoubleDOS and Fido 11t


         First, let me express my appreciation for the responses to my
     problems with print spoolers and communications.  That appears to
     be all worked out now.  Fido 11/301 is now running 24 hours a day
     at (502) 762-3140 thanks to SoftLogic's DoubleDOS program  and  a
     friendly  area  sysop  who  helped get things set up.  I had been
     searching for an affordable multitasker for some time;  Multilink
     is  apparently the Cadillac of the line but the analogy holds for
     its price as well.  I tried Topview.  I couldn't  shoehorn  Fido,
     our career guidance program, DISCOVER (copyright ACT corporation)
     and  Topview  into  a  640k machine.  I don't think Topview likes
     ANSI.SYS, either.  Wonder of wonders,  what comes in the mail one
     day  but  a  flier  from  SoftLogic.  Having  noted  on the logon
     screens of a couple of Fidos a mention of  DoubleDOS,  I  quickly
     ordered  a  copy.  A sysop in a nearby city indicated that he had
     had no problem with it.  The copy came and was installed.  It  is
     copy  protected,  but  does  not write bad sectors as part of its
     copy protection,  as best I can tell.  Three  installs/uninstalls
     are permitted.

         We  quickly got things running with DoubleDOS but the dreaded
     "Not enough memory to run" message kept popping up when Fido  was
     called.  Trial  and  error  led  to  my  clearing  CONFIG.SYS and
     AUTOEXEC.BAT of all prompt and set strings,  leaving only a  path
     to  the root directory.  Things ran fine.  I see that ENVIRON.FIX
     is out which tells how to alter the environment size of  Fido  to
     cure  this  problem.  Well,  things have run fine since then.  We
     have the BBS up in background of 212k (more than is necessary for
     Fido but just enough for PIBterm) and DISCOVER in foreground with
     the remainder of memory.

         DoubleDOS only takes about 18k plus or minus depending on how
     it is configured and allows four options for printer  drivers.  A
     clock  driven  buffer  seems to work fine;  there is an interrupt
     driven buffer option.  Given my luck with  interrupts,  I  stayed
     away from it.  DoubleDOS runs very nicely from batch,  setting up
     both partitions without intervention.  It also includes a  screen
     blanker.  I haven't tried this.

         The  disk  also  contains a ton of other material;  fixes for
     many, many programs, documentation for programmers,  and a notice
     about  a  bulletin  board  run by SoftLogic.  Their BBS,  an RBBS
     system,  can be reached  at  (603)  644-5556.  Quite  a  package.
     Performance  degradation  occurs;  but  is noticeable only if you
     know what the program looks like in a single  tasking  situation.
     I  guess about 15 percent slowdown occurs,  particularly on heavy
     use of the disk.  I have only found  one  possible  problem  with
     Fido and DoubleDOS.

         I  am  not  a  programmer  and  do  not  fully understand how
     Watchdog works;  however,  when it is run to protect  the  system
     during  remote exits from Fido,  a problem may occur when Fido is
     stopped from the  console.  If  no  program  is  running  in  the
     partition  in  which Watchdog was run,  then switching partitions


     Fidonews                     Page 7                   17 Mar 1986





     usually causes a crash.  Anybody have any ideas?  The solution  I
     use  is  either  not  to attempt a partition switch when the Fido
     partition is inactive (no program running) or to run Fido without
     a setting for (O)utside or 0 (and no Watchdog) in the batch file.
     No sweat then.

         All in all a fine program,  and a $49.95,  reasonably priced.
     SoftLogic's address is:

                    530 Chestnut Street
                    Manchester, NH 03101

         I hope this review is of value to anyone needing to multitask
     Fido and who doesn't know how.

                                  RemSysop


     Hello!

     I have written a new program  to  handle  the  USER.BBS  file  on
     Fidos.  I'm  not  sure about everyone,  but I'm sure there's more
     than just me that logs onto their board remotely and there's many
     of us who have co-sysops who validate users for access.


     Problem:

     The problem I've always had is that the only programs  out  there
     to handle the USER.BBS file were either programs that worked from
     the console only,  or they were programs who took forever to do a
     simple chore because of the way they handled  the  screen.  Most,
     if not all, simply scroll the screen and reprint the whole record
     every time you make a change.

     Not only that problem,  but most,  if not all, require you to use
     redirection or CTTY to work correctly.  Then  you  run  into  the
     problem  of  carrier  loss.  Sure,  you  can  run  Watchdog,  but
     rebooting is a sloppy way of handling  things  for  something  as
     simple  as monitoring the carrier.  Also,  if you use redirection
     or CTTY then you can't  see  what's  going  on  at  the  console.
     Someone  could  be  rearranging  your whole USER.BBS file and you
     wouldn't even know it because all I/O is going and coming through
     the com port.  Sloppy, that's all it is.


     Solution:

     I have written a program that  works  both  at  the  console  and
     remotely.  This  program uses interrupt driven communication just
     like Fido does so that you can "type ahead" just  like  on  Fido.
     It also displays everything on the console just like it does over
     the com port.  When your co-sysop is online,  you can see what he
     is doing.  Not only that,  but  my  program  has  a  simultaneous
     keyboards  option that can be toggled on/off just like Fido does.
     That way you can do things while the person on the phone  watches
     on  his  terminal.  It  also  has  the  ability  to  drop carrier
     immediately (Alt-X) just in case  the  worst  nightmare  were  to
     occur and you find someone has broken into your system.

     When  using  this remotely it looks and works exactly the same as
     when using it at the  console.  All  the  output  uses  the  ANSI
     escape  sequences  and  so  it  works like a full screen program.
     When you change something it doesn't reprint the whole screen, it
     just locates the cursor and changes  it  on  screen.  That's  the
     best way of doing it!

     What  about  carrier  loss?  I'm  glad  you  asked.  This program
     constantly monitors the carrier  and  if  carrier  is  lost,  the

     program exits and your batch file can restart Fido.

     I  have  released  this  program  as  shareware  and  it  can  be
     downloaded from my Fido BBS.  If you  like  the  program,  please
     make  a  contribution  so I can continue to make additions.  I've
     spent a lot of time on this program,  so if you  like  it  please
     contribute and help keep shareware alive.

     REMSYS11.ARC - RemSysop version 1.1 is the current version.

     Oh  and  while you're online check out the Village.  It's another
     program I wrote that uses  Fido's  O)utside  command.  Users  can
     play the Slot Machine, play the Shuffle game, have Gunfights with
     other  users,  etc.  Of course,  only normal access users can get
     into it so you'll have to wait till your second call to  try  the
     Village.  I  named  it  the  "Village"  because  I had it working
     before TJ came out with the O)utside command.  I just changed the
     V)ersion command to work like the 0 command,  so it's been up for
     a while.

     From:
     Bob Spivack
     Sysop, Fido 143/3 (408) 972-8164
     "The PC-AT" Fido


     Greetings fellow Fido users.  I have finally managed to get a few
     minutes  to  jot  down a few notes and comments  in  response  to
     several articles in recent newsletters.

     Please  feel  free  to respond to me  directly  via  FidoNet,  by
     calling  up  my Fido and leaving a message to the  SYSOP,  or  by
     incorporating your comments in your own FidoNews article.

     1.  Claims of FidoNews readership:

     Off  and  on  I  have seen claims that 50  or  60  thousand  Fido
     enthousiasts read the Fidonews.  Although I believe that the news
     does  reach  many  people,   I  doubt  it  is  that  large.   The
     calculation  assumes  an average number of callers per Fido  node
     multiplied by the number of nodes.

     Although every Fido is different, I have found that NO ONE except
     me,  the Sysop, reads the FidoNews on my system.  I am curious if
     my  system  is an exception or whether the actual  readership  is
     perhaps  only  incrementally  greater than  the  number  of  Fido
     nodes/SYSOPS.

     2.  The "underlining" problem in Fido documentation:

     The  problem  of not all printers handling underlining  well  was
     raised a while back but no concensus seems to have surfaced.   My
     own two-cents worth is that I truly dislike trying to peruse text
     files  on my video console when they have underlining that  makes
     words turn to blank spaces on my screen.

     3.  Fido Addictions:

     I  find that I too,  cannot resist hitting control-C on my pc and
     then  "Type mailer.log" as the first thing I do after I roll  out
     of  bed.   There  is  just  something  mystical  about  receiving
     incoming mail.   You know something can arrive every day, but you
     never know exactly where (or who) it is coming from.

     This is the real "mystique" of Fido and why,  in my opinion, once
     you  get hooked on Fido you can never go back to RBBS  and  other
     systems like that.


     4:  National Mail Hour versus Free-for-all delivery:

     Recent  FidoNews  articles have carried messages from two  SYSOPS
     complaining  that  Fido is getting too big for just  a  one  hour
     nightly mail linkup.   I totally disagree that the solution is to
     expand  the mail time or to allow mail to be sent/received at any
     time of the day.

     The beauty (elegance,  simplicity, pick your own word) of Fido is


     Fidonews                     Page 13                  17 Mar 1986





     that  the only discipline it imposes on every legitimate node  is
     to be available for one hour every night to send/receive mail.

     I  suspect,  that  the nodes that find themselves overloaded  are
     trying  to do too much.   Maybe being a  local/regional  host,  a
     Usenet  gateway,  and a high volume private node is just asking a
     bit too much.

     The whole purpose of regions,  nets,  subhosts,  etc. is to use a
     "divide  and conquer" approach to increased traffic and/or  cost-
     effective  (especially  important for a  non-commercial  network)
     approach to dividing up the mail-forwarding chores.

     Along  the  same lines,  if one or two  nodes  consistently  have
     trouble connecting with one another, they should simply arrange a
     private  mail  schedule to supplement the national or local  mail
     time slots.

     I don't want to stand on my soapbox too loudly,  but I think  the
     richness  of  Fido is such that there are many solutions  already
     available to solving traffic congestion problems.   Tom's limited
     time  and effort is probably better spent adding new features  or
     cpabilities  that extend the concept of Fido/FidoNet rather  than
     just fine-tuning it.

     To paraphrase (bastardize?) what Spock said:   "The needs of  the
     few or the one, should not outweigh the needs of the many!"

     Thom Henderson, 107/8

                         An Alternative to LISTGEN


     Nothing against John Warren.  He's done a great job  on  LISTGEN.
     It's  just  that  it's  a  bit slow.  That's not his fault.  It's
     Microsoft's fault for making the BASIC compiler so slow.

     Now St. Louis is adding another step on us: applying a difference
     file to the node  list.  Again,  nothing  against  them.  They're
     trying to keep everybody's phone bill down.

     But still, it all adds up to more time spent creating a node list
     every week.  There has GOT to be a better way!

     I've  found  my  own solution,  which I'm willing to share.  I've
     written a program called XLATLIST to translate my node list,  and
     I'm  making  it  available.  There's  some of the usual shareware
     junk tossed in; I'll get to that in a bit.

     XLATLIST does basically what LISTGEN does,  but faster.  I  timed
     it on node list #66 (using NODEDIFF.059 to turn NODELIST.059 into
     NODELIST.066),  and tossed in four private network files.  I told
     it to produce a narrow Fido list,  a wide Fido list (each with  a
     sorted index), a node list for Fido, and a data file for ROUTEGEN
     (a  separate  route  file  generator).  It  took five minutes and
     fifteen seconds.  That's on a vanilla XT.

     (Side note:  Is  that  really  faster  than  LISTGEN?  I've  been
     playing  with  XLATLIST for a few months,  so I really don't know
     anymore.)

     At any rate,  it's faster still if you cut down on the number  of
     files you want it to create.

     I  should mention a few things.  Since I was working on it anyway
     I figured I'd add some stuff.  For instance,  XLATLIST can add an
     index  to nets and regions to the back of the Fido lists.  If you
     have a copy of Ben  Baker's  excellent  QSORT  program  (which  I
     highly  recommend) then XLATLIST can sort the index by region/net
     number.

     Also,  you don't need to tell XLATLIST which node list  to  scan.
     It looks on your disk for the one with the highest number.  While
     it's at it,  it also looks for the NODEDIFF file with the highest
     number.  If it finds one,  then it applies it to  the  node  list
     (but ONLY if it should!)

     This  is  more  useful than it sounds.  Allow me to expound.  The
     gang in St.  Louis is planning on shipping a full node list about
     once  a quarter (four times a year).  In between,  they'll ship a
     NODEDIFF file containing only the changes to  the  previous  node
     list.  It will be your job (using a utility) to apply the changes
     to  the  previous  week's  node list in order to come up with the
     current node list.

     Since in any given week you might get either a  node  list  OR  a


     Fidonews                     Page 15                  17 Mar 1986





     node difference file,  then you have to know what to do in either
     case.  Or rather, your batch file does.

     Since both will be shipped as NODEDIFF.ARC, then you can automate
     it easily using XLATLIST, like so:

         for %%x in (nodediff.a*) do arc x %%x node*.*
         xlatlist
         del nodediff.a*

     The first statement is a tricky way of extracting the NODELIST or
     NODEDIFF file from the current archive, whatever it may be named.
     The  second  statement  invokes  XLATLIST.  The  third  statement
     cleans  up the garbage.  (Obviously you'll want to tailor this to
     your own situation.)

     The beauty of it is that XLATLIST will always do the right  thing
     automatically.  If you got a difference file,  then it will apply
     it to create the new node list.  If you got a node list,  then it
     will  reject  any previous difference files and just use the node
     list.

     I mentioned ROUTEGEN,  didn't I?  ROUTEGEN is a companion program
     to  XLATLIST.  It  doesn't  define  a  new  routing  language  or
     anything.  It's basically  a  dedicated  macro  preprocessor  for
     route  files.  A  ROUTEGEN  control  file  looks much like a Fido
     route file,  except that things have  been  added.  You  can  say
     things like:

         Define outhost 16
         Route-to outhost all except net-107, area-201
         Send-to country-1
         Poll area-201-478


     Now a word about shareware,  as it applies to XLATLIST.  Any non-
     commercial FidoNet sysop can  use  XLATLIST  for  free.  See  the
     manual  for  terms  and conditions (nothing onerous,  I promise!)
     Commercial users have to pay a license fee.  All the rest of  you
     are encouraged to encourage me (I love encouragement!),  but it's
     voluntary.  Ten percent of anything I get (if I get  anything  at
     all)  will  go  to the International FidoNet Association.  End of
     commercial.

     If you are interested, XLATLIST is available from SEAboard,  node
     107/7, and probably from other places by the time you read this.

                          Compatibility with Tapes


     Unfortunately,  as the fact  is  for  now,  almost  none  of  the
     existing  tape  backup  systems can swap tapes.  Although most of
     them use the standard 3M DC-600, it can even be a problem using a
     tape created on another system of the same make!  A good (of  you
     might say:  Horrible) example for this is TallGrass Technologies:
     If you crash your hard disk (also a TallGrass), your tapes aren't
     worth a nickel,  they cannot be restored to another TG hard disk!
     (If  you haven't been wise enough to use the extremely slow file-
     by-file copy to tape function).

     Now,  there seems to be a solution to all  our  worries:  Several
     vendors  have  finally  agreed on a new standard,  called QIC-24.
     This new standard will set (among others) the way  the  data  are
     stored, how the tape is formatted, etc.  This actually means that
     any  tape  created  at any system can be read by any other device
     using that standard (pronounced "QUICK twenty four").

     I have been in touch with Tandberg Data, one of the manufacturers
     of drives for this new standard, and they are shortly releasing a
     drive with card for  PC's.  Also  the  worldwide  selling  vendor
     QUBIE has promised a new tape backup using this new standard very
     soon,  and  several  other  I've been in touch with are launching
     compatible systems, too.

     My suggestion is that we all go for this new standard,  it  would
     make life easier for all of us.

     If  you  have  any  comments on this issue,  please send mail to:

     I have sent Robert a tape containing about 250  disks  of  public
     domain  software.  A  friend of mine (Alan Solomon) "borrowed" an
     AST Colossus for a couple of weeks in order to write a review for
     one of the UK PC comics.  We hooked it up to one of his PC's  and
     then  proceeded  to  fill  it up with public domain software.  It
     took the first 100 disks of the PC-BLUE library and the fist  125
     disks  of  the  PC-SIG  library.  Each  disk  went  into  its own
     subdirectory and then the whole thing was ARChived using the  ARC
     program  from SEA.  The tape is a 60Meg DC600a,  you can work out
     for yourself how much is  used.  It  is  in  the  QIC  format  as
     described  above  and  if  you  can read it (and you want a copy)
     please contact either me (Frank Thornley) of Robert Hercz.

     It took about 7 days to make the tape and I suggest  that  anyone
     who  takes  a  copy  of  the tape makes a contribution (50 pounds
     suggested) to Alan Solomon.  You  can  contact  Alan  through  my
     board.  We  are  hoping  to  make a tape in several other formats
     (Christie,  Irwin,  Sysgen) When these tapes are available I will
     let  you  know.  The idea is that we can all increase or software

     libraries.  At the moment  Alan  and  myself  have  put  all  the
     software  we have on line.  We too hope to increase our libraries
     so remember it's a two way operation, I expect anyone who takes a
     copy of our tape to offer Compulink any  public  domain  software
     that we don't yet have.

     There  is  a  box  of  disks circulating the UK at the moment.  I
     believe these originate from Ode De Presno.  These have  been  in
     the  UK  for  about  three  months  now  and I still haven't seen
     them!!!  If Ode (pardon me if I  am  spelling  your  name  wrong)
     reads this;  many thanks, and many apologies from those in the UK
     who will remain nameless for the delay in returning  your  disks.
     When  I  (eventually)  receive  the  disks  I  will  return  them
     immediately.

     There is a lesson to be learned in this matter.  If  someone  has
     the  decency to send out some disks to be circulated we MUST make
     sure that the originator receives  his  disks  back  as  soon  as
     possible.  I  suggest that any disks to be circulated are sent to
     the various country co-ordinators,  they in turn will take a copy
     and return them to the originator.  If this is not practical then
     the  recipient  must take an copy and send them on to the next on
     the list IMMEDIATELY!!

     There is no excuse for holding onto them for weeks at a time,  as
     is the case in the disks from Ode.

     I am searching for software that does optical ray  tracing.  Most
     any  language  would  be  OK.  Being  able to get my hands on the
     source code would be wonderful,  but not a requirement.  I have a
     BASIC  program  that  performs  meridional  ray  tracing that was
     published several years back in Sky & Telescope  but  it  is  not
     very well documented, in fact, it's not at all documented! It was
     translated from FORTRAN to BASIC back in the days when 16K of RAM
     was  a  lot  of  memory  and  REMark  statements  were out of the
     question when writing for a micro. Anyway, I'd be more than happy
     to exchange PD software,  or pay the going  price  for  a  decent
     optics program. Contact me at Fido 138/0.

                                   M2Make
                        A Make Utility for Modula-2

         M2Make is a utility for  updating  complex  Modula-2  systems
     inspired by the MAKE program found on UNIX systems.  The Modula-2
     language allows M2Make to work directly from  your  source  files
     rather  than  requiring  you  to specify the dependancies of your
     various modules in a separatly written  and  maintained  "script"
     file.

         If  you  are  writing  large Modula-2 systems then M2Make can
     save you time and frustration. You need never get another "Module
     version conflict" message in your  compiles  or  links.  You  can
     update   any   number   of   interdependant   DEFINITION   and/or
     IMPLEMENTATION modules and create a new executable with just  one
     command.  Even  IMPORT  new modules and M2Make will automatically
     figure out which modules need to be recompiled  (and  only  those
     which need to be recompiled).

         M2Make  runs  on  MS-DOS  (or  PC-DOS) versions 2 or 3 and is
     designed to work with Logitech Modula-2/86.

         Normal distribution is via Fidonet attached  files.  This  is
     not a public domain program so I am relying on the honesty of the
     sysops  to  give this program only to the intended recipient.  If
     you want a diskette add $5.

         A copy of the documentation file is  free  and  available  on
     request (via fidonet again).

         M2Make executable and example files     $30
         maintainance and updates                $20
         sources                                $500

              Now available from Micro Consulting Associates!!

     Public Domain collection - 300+  "ARC"  archives  -  10  megs  of
     software  and  other  goodies,  and that's "archived" size!  When
     unpacked,  you get approximately 17 megabytes worth of all  kinds
     of  software,  from text editors to games to unprotection schemes
     to communications programs, compilers, interpreters, etc...

     This collection is the result of more than 10 months of intensive
     downloads from just about 100 or more BBS's  and  other  sources,
     all  of  which have been examined,  indexed and archived for your
     convenience.  Starting a Bulletin Board System?  Want to  add  on
     to your software base without spending thousands of dollars? This
     is the answer!!!

     To  order  the  library,  send  $100  (personal or company check,
     postal money order or company purchase order) to:

                    Micro Consulting Associates, Fido 103/511
                    Post Office Box 4296
                    200-1/2 E. Balboa Boulevard
                    Balboa, Ca. 92661-4296

     Please allow 3 weeks for delivery of your order.

     Note:  No profit is made from  the  sale  of  the  Public  Domain
     software  in  this  collection.  The price is applied entirely to
     the cost of  downloading  the  software  over  the  phone  lines,
     running  a  BBS  to  receive  file  submissions,  and inspecting,
     cataloguing, archiving and maintaining the files.  Obtaining this
     software  yourself  through  the  use  of a computer with a modem
     using commercial phone access would cost you much more than  what
     we charge for the service...

     Please specify what type of format you would like the disks to be
     prepared on.  The following choices are available:

             IBM PC-DOS Backup utility
             Zenith MS-DOS 2.11 Backup Utility
             DSBackup
             Fastback
             Plain  ol' files (add $50,  though,  it's a lot  of
             work and takes more diskettes...)

     Add  $30  if  you  want  the  library  on  1.2 meg AT disks (more
     expensive disks).  There are no  shipping  or  handling  charges.
     California residents add 6% tax.

     For each sale, $10 will go to the FidoNet Administrators.

     archive utility,  are proud to announce the release of the SEAdog
     electronic mail system.

     SEAdog  is  a  PC-based  electronic  mail  system  which is fully
     FidoNet compatible.  In addition  to  all  the  functionality  of

     o   Return receipts

     o   Audit trails

     o   Message forwarding, with or without a retained copy

     o   Twenty four hour mail reception

     o   A full screen user interface that our beta test sites fell in
         love with!

     SEAdog  is  NOT a bulletin board system,  but it can be used as a
     "front end" for Fido (version 11t),  allowing you to add the full
     functionality of SEAdog to your existing system.
