     of Directors:

     A.  For each  action  to  be  voted  upon  there  shall  be  four
         possible responses:

           1.  YEA - Election of this option signifies support for the
               motion in question.
           2.  NAY -  Election of  this option  signifies rejection of
               the motion in question.
           3.  ABSTAIN -  Election of  this option makes the statement
               that the  voter either  has no choice or chooses to not
               decide for whatever reason.
           4.  HOLD - Election of this option signifies a request that
               the due date of the motion in question automatically be
               held over to the following vote date.

     B.  In order  for a  motion appearing  on  the  floor  during  an
         electronic session  to be  passed or  rejected there  must be
         received a  number of such votes from a majority of the total
         of all  members of  the Board  eligible to  vote, except that
         such total  shall be  reduced by  the number of ABSTAIN votes
         cast.   When a motion fails to receive such a majority of YEA
         or NAY votes, it shall automatically be held over to the next
         voting period.

                ICONS Help you get the thought out!


             Are you afraid that you come across differently
      electronically than you do on paper, over the phone or
      in person?  The answer may be icons!  The icons listed
     below can help you express those no-verbal signals that
     are all but impossible to express over the net.

            "I've had nothing yet," Alice replied in an offended
            tone: "so I can't take more."

     That quote (from Lewis Carroll if you saw a movie of _Alice in
     Wonderland_ so bad that it didn't include that line) expresses
     the mood of the moment. Or to put it another way:

            I'm Nobody! Who are you?
            Are you -- Nobody -- too?
            Then there's a pair of us!

                                 OVERVIEW

     NaughtNet is a new amateur e-mail network. It is an offspring of
     the world-famous Fidonet network.

     The founders of Naughtnet believe that Naughtnet addresses all
     the problems that past alternate networks were formed to
     address, and in fact will address any future problems that
     Fidonet nodes have with IFNA and the Fidonet heirarchy. Such
     problems, as we see them, include:

     o   Entirely too much interest shown by certain people in the
         functioning of FidoNet, disturbing the conformity of a well-
         ordered network;

     o   Communication is all too possible, with more and more nodes
         every week, and echomail making even users able to talk with
         those in far-away cities and countries (this being alien to
         the initial spirit of FidoNet, where only sysops could
         afford to send mail);

     o   Expansion of BBS and netmail software possibilites
         (including Opus and BinkleyTerm), makes it impossible for
         the old-time Fido monopoly to continue;

     o   A tremendous upsurge in the number of people willing to
         volunteer for Net, Region, and Zone Coordinators, as well as
         chairmen and members of committees, suggests that the sysops
         at large want a voice in the operation of Fidonet; this
     FidoNews 5-06                Page 8                    8 Feb 1988


         would be dangerous to the order of the net, and thus should
         be eliminated.


     We feel that these are the reasons that IFNA has proven a
     complete failure and both it and FidoNet should be scrapped in
     favor of NaughtNet.

     0.0     Definitions

     NaughtNet nodes are grouped on several levels.  These are as
     follows:

     o   Nodes;  A node is a single Naughtnet address. This is the
         smallest recognized unit of NaughtNet, and the only one
         anybody likes.

     o   Networks; A network is a collection of nodes, usually in a
         relatively small geographic area. Networks coordinate their
         mail activity to decrease cost and increase mail throughput.

         In NaughtNet it is felt that networks are one of the prime
         causes of disorder; nodes are wont to complain when they
         don't get everything they want from their network hosts.
         Therefore, networks have been eliminated in Naughtnet. We
         feel this will lessen both the number of complaints and the
         number of people who want a voice in discussions.

     o   Regions;  A region is a well defined geographic area
         containing nodes. Of course, the nodes can't be in networks,
         but that makes the Regional Coordinator's job easier. Here
         are the regions that make up Naughtnet:

         Earth   -- 00  Moon     -- 00  Pluto and Charon      -- 00
         Jupiter -- 00  Callisto -- 00  Other Jovian moons    -- 00
         Europa  -- 00  Ganymede -- 00  Jovian rings          -- 00
         Mars    -- 00  Phobos   -- 00  Saturnian rings       -- 00
         Mercury -- 00  Deimos   -- 00  Uranus                -- 00
         Sun     -- 00  Venus    -- 00  Uranian moons         -- 00
         Saturn  -- 00  Titan    -- 00  Other Saturnian moons -- 00
         Io      -- 00  Neptune  -- 00  Triton and Nereid     -- 00

     o   Zones;  A zone is a large geographic area containing many
         regions, and covering one or more astronomical districts.
         These are the zones in NaughtNet:

         Solar System -- 0         Rest of Milky Way -- 0
         Andromeda Galaxy -- 0     Rest of Local Group -- 0
                        Rest of Universe -- 0


     o   NaughtNet; This indicates nothing at all, as should be self-
         evident.


     0.0     The Levels of NaughtNet
     FidoNews 5-06                Page 9                    8 Feb 1988


     NaughtNet has no real levels, because it has weak legs and can't
     climb stairs, and is claustrophobic and can't ride elevators.
     But the following will suffice:

     o   The  International  Coordinator; The  International
         Coordinator can compile all of the node lists from all of
         the regions and creates the master node list, which could
         then be distributed over NaughtNet if the International
         Coordinator really wanted to for some reason. The following
         is a sample nodelist (with widths wrapped around):

     Region,00,Around_Nowhere,Nowhere_Much,Nobody,-Unpublished-
         ,000,#00:
     ,00,Zilch,Blank,Null,-Unpublished-,000,#00:
     Down,00,Naught,Absence,Tabula_Rasa,-Unpublished-,000,#00:
     ,00,Nihility,Cipher,Not_Me_Dude!,-Unpublished-,000,#00:
     ,00,Insubstantiality,Oblivion,Nominis_Umbra,-Unpublished-
         ,000,#00:


     o   The Zone Coordinator; In some cases the International
         Coordinator will appoint a Zone Coordinator to oversee
         FidoNet operations in a given zone. There are no duties or
         responsibilities of Zone Coordinators, so usually there
         aren't any. In fact, the appointment of a Zone Coordinator
         is grounds for removal of any particular IC, so it's not
         done a lot; it is however an easy way to resign.

     o   The  Regional Coordinator;  The Regional Coordinator
         maintains the list of nodes in his region. Usually any given
         RC won't bother, since all the nodes in NaughtNet are
         unpublished, but sometimes he gets bored.

     o   The  Network  Coordinator;  Anyone claiming to be a Network
         Coordinator is summarily shot in regions where no other
         legal jurisdiction exists. In other regions that person will
         simply be forced to do thirty pushups, unless that person is
         (as well as being part of NaughtNet) an ice-cream salesman,
         in which case he will have to eat thirty Frozen Yogurt Push-
         Ups <tm>.

     o   The Network Routing Hub; Network Routing Hubs exist only in
         three-tiered networks.  Since in NaughtNet there are no
         networks, there are obviously no Network Routing Hubs.
         Anyone claming to be a Network Routing Hub will suffer the
         same fate as his Network Coordinator, or if there is no
         Network Coordinator, will be placed in the nearest planetary
         mental institution.

     o   The system operator (sysop);  The sysop formulates his own
         policy for running his board and dealing with his users, so
         that will not be discussed in this document.  However,  the
         sysop must also do everything the IC wants and not argue
         about it, even if the sysop feels it's none of the IC's
         business.

     FidoNews 5-06                Page 10                   8 Feb 1988


     o   The user; Policy and procedures for the individual user
         on any given board is determined by that user. Sysops can't
         do anything about it, that's just tough.

     These levels act to put everybody under the thumb of whoever
     takes charge; this is considered desireable because the author
     of this document is in charge.

     For example, a Regional Coordinator is solely responsible to the
     International Coordinator for anything that may or may not
     happen in his region. From the point of view of the
     International Coordinator, the Regional Coordinator is totally
     and completely responsible for the smooth operation of his
     region. Likewise, from the point of view of anybody else, the
     International Coordinator is just as much an interfering jerk as
     he is to the Regional Coordinator.

     If a person at any level is unable for any reason to properly
     perform his duties, then he will suffer the fate of a Net
     Coordinator. That's the breaks.

                                   OVERVIEW

     FidoNet is an amateur electronic mail system.  As such, all of
     its participants and operators are non-paid volunteers.  From
     its early beginnings as a few friends swapping messages back and
     forth, it has now grown to (August 1987) over 2000 different
     systems on four continents.

     FidoNet is large enough that it would quickly fall apart of its
     own weight unless some sort of structure and control were
     imposed on it.  Multinet operation provides the structure.
     Decentralized management provides the control.  This document is
     an attempt to describe the procedures which have been developed
     to manage the network.



     1.1  The Levels of FidoNet

     FidoNet nodes are grouped on several levels.  These are as
     follows:

     o FidoNet; This indicates the entire public amateur mail
     network, as administered by the International FidoNet
     Association, and as defined by the weekly node list.

     o Zones; A zone is a large geographic area containing many
     regions, and covering one or more countries and/or continents.

     o Regions; A region is a well defined geographic area containing
     nodes which may or may not be combined into networks.  A typical
     region will contain many nodes in networks, and a few
     independent nodes, which are not a part of any network.

     o Networks; A network is a collection of nodes, usually in a
     relatively small geographic area.  Networks coordinate their
     mail activity to decrease cost and increase mail throughput.

     o Hubs; A hub is a subdivision of a network that assists in
     network management by routing mail to, and by coordinating for,
     a collection of nodes in that network.  In general only the
     larger networks will have hubs.

     o Nodes; A node is a single FidoNet address, and is the smallest
     recognized unit of FidoNet.

     o Points; A point is a node on a private network which is
     accessible through a node on FidoNet.

     1.2 Coordinators

     Each subdivision at each level is managed by a coordinator.  A
     coordinator is a person who coordinates the technical aspects of
     network mail.  This entails both administrative and technical
     tasks, which will be described later.  The following levels of
     coordinators are currently recognized:
     FidoNews 5-06                Page 13                   8 Feb 1988


     o The International Coordinator; The International Coordinator
     compiles all of the node lists from all of the regions and
     creates the master node list, which is then distributed over
     FidoNet.

     o The Zone Coordinator; A Zone Coordinator maintains the list of
     administrative nodes in his zone and accepts node lists from the
     Regional Coordinators in his zone.  He compiles these lists to
     create a zone node list, which he then sends to the
     International Coordinator for inclusion in the master node list.
     A Zone Coordinator is also responsible for overseeing any zone
     gateways in his zone.

     o The Regional Coordinator; A Regional Coordinator maintains the
     list of independent nodes in his region and accepts node lists
     from the Network Coordinators in his region.  He compiles these
     lists to create a regional node list for his region, which he
     then sends to his Zone Coordinator.  A Regional Coordinator does
     not perform routing services for any nodes in his region.

     o The Network Coordinator; A Network Coordinator maintains the
     list of any nodes in his network that are not served by a hub
     and accepts node lists from the Hub Coordinators in his network.
     He compiles these lists to create a network node list for his
     network, which he then sends to his Regional Coordinator.  A
     Network Coordinator is also responsible for forwarding any mail
     addressed to nodes in his network.

     o The Hub Coordinator; A Hub Coordinator maintains the list of
     nodes in his hub and sends it to his Network Coordinator.  A Hub
     Coordinator is also responsible for forwarding any mail
     addressed to nodes in his hub.

     o The Point Coordinator; Any node in FidoNet can act as a
     gateway to a point network.  The Sysop (or system operator) of
     that node then acts as the coordinator for his point network.

     o The Sysop; A Sysop formulates his own policy for running his
     board and dealing with his users, so that will not be discussed
     in this document.  However, a Sysop must also mesh with the rest
     of the FidoNet system if he is to send and receive mail, and
     that will be discussed here.

     These levels act to distribute the administration and control of
     FidoNet to the lowest possible level, while still allowing for
     coordinated action over the entire mail system.  Administration
     is made possible by operating in a strict top-down manner.  That
     is, a coordinator at any given level is responsible to the
     coordinator immediately above him, and responsible for everyone
     below him.

     For example, a Regional Coordinator is solely responsible to his
     Zone Coordinator for anything that may or may not happen in his
     region.  From the point of view of the Zone Coordinator, the
     Regional Coordinator is totally and completely responsible for
     the smooth operation of his region.  Likewise, from the point of
     FidoNews 5-06                Page 14                   8 Feb 1988


     view of the Regional Coordinator, the Network Coordinators are
     totally and completely responsible for the smooth operation of
     their networks.

     If a coordinator at any level above sysop is unable for any
     reason to properly perform his duties, he can be replaced by his
     coordinator at the next level up.  For example, if a Regional
     Coordinator is failing to perform his duties, then his Zone
     Coordinator can appoint a new Regional Coordinator to replace
     him.

     The primary responsibility of any coordinator is technical
     management of network operations.  Management decisions should
     be made strictly on technical grounds.

                             Chapter 1

                          SYSOP PROCEDURES
     A sysop of an individual node can pretty much do as he pleases,
     as long as he observes the mail events, is not excessively
     annoying to other nodes on FidoNet, and does not promote the
     distribution of pirated copyrighted software.

     National Mail Hour is the heart of FidoNet, as this is when
     network mail is passed between systems.  Any system which wishes
     to be a part of FidoNet must be able to receive mail at this
     time.  A system which is a member of a network may also be
     required to observe additional mail events, as defined by his
     Network Coordinator.

     Failure to observe the proper mail events is sufficient grounds
     for any node to be dropped from FidoNet without notice (since
     notice is generally given by FidoNet mail).

     Network mail systems generally operate unattended and place
     calls at odd hours of the night.  If a system tries to call an
     incorrect or out of date number, it could cause some poor
     citizen's phone to ring in the wee hours of the morning, much to
     the annoyance of innocent bystanders and civil authorities.  For
     this reason, a sysop who sends mail is obligated to obtain and
     use the most recent edition of the node list as is practical.

     A system which has been dropped from the network is said to be
     excommunicated (i.e.  unable to communicate).  A node which has
     been excommunicated may or may not be listed for a time in the
     "dog house", which is included in the comments at the end of the
     node list.  If you find that you have been excommunicated
     without warning, then that means that your coordinator was
     unable to contact you.  You should rectify the problem and
     report back.

     The exact timing of National Mail Hour is set for each zone by
     the Zone Coordinator.  In the United States, National Mail Hour
     is observed from 0900 to 1000 GMT every day, weekends included.
     In each of the United States time zones, this would be as
     follows:
     FidoNews 5-06                Page 15                   8 Feb 1988


      Eastern Standard Time  4 AM to 5 AM
      Central Standard Time  3 AM to 4 AM
      Mountain Standard Time 2 AM to 3 AM
      Pacific Standard Time  1 AM to 2 AM
      Hawaii Standard Time  11 PM to Midnight

     FidoNet does not observe daylight savings time.  In areas which
     observe daylight savings time the FidoNet mail schedules must be
     adjusted in the same direction as the clock change.
     Alternatively, you can simply leave your system on standard
     time.

     2.1 How to get a node number

     You must first obtain a current node list so that you can send
     mail.  You do not need a node number to send mail, but you must
     have one in order for others to send mail to you.

     The first step in obtaining a current node list is to locate a
     FidoNet bulletin board.  No help there; you're on your own.
     Most bulletin board lists include at least a few FidoNet
     systems, and usually identify them as such, so this shouldn't be
     too hard.

     If the sysop of any FidoNet system does not have a node list
     available for downloading, then he can probably tell you where
     to get one.

     Once you have a node list, you must determine which coordinator
     to apply to.  The coordinator of any network or region is always
     node zero of that network or region.  A Hub Coordinator will
     always be indicated in the node list by a "HUB" prefix.

     You should apply to the lowest-level coordinator that covers
     your area.  For example, if you are located within the hub of a
     network, then you would apply to the Hub Coordinator.  If there
     is no network that covers your area, then you would apply to the
     Regional Coordinator for your region.

     Your application for a node number must be sent to the
     coordinator by FidoNet mail, and must include at least the
     following:

      1) Your name.
      2) The name of your system.
      3) The city and state where your system is located.
      4) The phone number to be used when calling your system.
      5) Your hours of operation.
      6)The maximum baud rate you can support.

     Your coordinator may want additional information.  If so, he
     will contact you.  Please allow at least two to three weeks for
     a node number request to be processed.

     2.2 If you are going down

     FidoNews 5-06                Page 16                   8 Feb 1988


     If your node will be down for an extended period (more than a
     day or two), then you should inform your coordinator as soon as
     possible.  If you do not do this, then other systems will still
     try to reach you while you are down, much to the annoyance of
     everyone.  Do not under any circumstances put an answering
     machine or similar device on your phone line while you are down.
     If you do, then calling systems will get the machine repeatedly,
     racking up large phone bills, which is very annoying.  See the
     section on Resolution of Disputes for details on what happens to
     annoying people.

     If your system goes down without warning, then you may be placed
     in the dog house, or even removed from the node list completely.

     If you will be leaving your system unattended for an extended
     period of time (such as while you are on vacation), you should
     notify your coordinator.  Systems do have a tendency to "crash"
     now and then, so you will probably want your coordinator to know
     that it is a temporary condition if it happens while you are
     away.

     2.3 How to form a network

     If there are several nodes in your area, but no network, then
     you may wish to form your own.  You may also be requested to
     form a network by your Regional Coordinator.

     Your first step is to contact the other sysops in your area.
     You must decide which nodes will comprise the network, and which
     of those nodes is going to be the Network Coordinator.  Your
     next step is to inform your Regional Coordinator.  You must send
     him a FidoNet message with the following information:

     1) The region number(s), or network number(s) if a network is
     splitting up, that are affected by the formation of your
     network.  The Regional Coordinator will inform the coordinators
     of any affected networks that a new network is in formation.

     2) The name that you wish to call your network.  Please try to
     select a name that relates to your grouping.  For example,
     SoCalNet for nodes in the Southern California Area and MassNet
     for Massachusettes Area.  Remember if you call yourself DOGNET
     it doesn't help others know what area of the country (or even
     what country) your group is in.

     3) A copy of the proposed network's nodelist.  The nodelist file
     should be named Frrr-nnn.NET where rrr is the proposed host's
     current region or network number and nnn is his current node
     number.  For example, if the proposed host is currently listed
     as node 5 in region 13, then you would name the file
     F013-005.NET.  This file should be sent attached to the message
     of Application for a Network Number.

             SAMPLE FORMAT OF A Frrr-nnn.NET FILE

     (Ed note:  Sample of St. Louis format NODELIST.BBS goes here.)
     FidoNews 5-06                Page 17                   8 Feb 1988


     Granting of a network number is not automatic.  Your Regional
     Coordinator will review your application and inform you of his
     decision.

     Do not send a network number request to the International
     Coordinator.  All network number requests must be processed by
     the Regional Coordinator.

                       COORDINATOR PROCEDURES

     This chapter describes the procedures followed by all
     coordinators at all levels.  Later we will go into more detail
     on those procedures which are specific to any given type of
     coordinator.

     All coordinators have four primary duties.  In order of
     decreasing importance, they are:

      1) Administrative tasks.

      2) Node list distribution.

      3) Newsletter distribution.

      4) Network mail distribution.

     At first glance it would seem that network mail distribution
     should be the highest priority, since after all that's why we're
     running a network in the first place.  But the first three
     priorities are needed to ensure smooth operation of the network,
     and hence must have a higher priority.

     3.1 Administrative tasks

     First and foremost, every coordinator is also the sysop of his
     own node.  It must be possible for others to reach you by
     network mail.  So in addition to the other tasks of a
     coordinator, you must also observe all of the requirements for
     being a node.

     3.1.1 Maintaining the node list

     A coordinator at any level must maintain his portion of the node
     list.  Almost any coordinator will have some nodes in his node
     list which are not a part of any subgroup.  For example, a Zone
     Coordinator must maintain a list of administrative nodes for his
     zone, and a Regional Coordinator must maintain a list of
     independent nodes in his region.  A Hub Coordinator (or the
     Network Coordinator in a network without hubs) must maintain the
     list of all nodes in his area.

     A coordinator is responsible for seeing to it that his portion
     of the node list is kept reasonably accurate.  You should
     attempt to implement name changes, phone number changes, and so
     FidoNews 5-06                Page 18                   8 Feb 1988


     forth in this node list as soon as possible.  You should also
     check from time to time to ensure that all of the listed nodes
     are in fact capable of accepting network mail.  How best to
     accomplish this is left to your discretion.

     If a node turns out to be "off the air" with no prior warning
     given to you, then you can either mark the node as down, place
     it in the dog house, or remove it from the node list completely,
     at your own discretion.

     3.1.2 Assigning node numbers

     You may assign node numbers to new nodes in your list, but keep
     in mind the following:

     1) It is your responsibility to ensure that the node number you
     assign is unique within that region or network.

     2) You should try to avoid assigning node numbers when an
     existing subdivision of your area already covers the location of
     the new node.  For example, a Regional Coordinator should try to
     avoid assigning independent nodes in a city that has its own
     network.

     You may also change the numbers of existing nodes in your area,
     though you should check with the respective nodes before doing
     so.

     You should not under any circumstances assign a node number to
     any system until you have received a formal request from that
     system by FidoNet mail.  This will ensure that the system is at
     least minimally operational.  The strict maintenance of this
     policy has been one of the great strengths of FidoNet.

     It is also recommended, though not required, that you call a
     board which is applying for a node number before assigning it a
     node number.

     You should use network mail to inform a new node of his node
     number, as this helps to insure that he is capable of receiving
     network mail.

     3.1.3 Problem resolution

     From time to time you may be called on to resolve a problem in
     your area.  This could be a technical problem relating to the
     four primary duties of a coordinator, or it could be related to
     annoying behaviour on the part of someone in your area.

     If the problem is caused by a node or a coordinator immediately
     under you, then it is your responsibility to resolve the problem
     in whatever manner you deem fit.  If the problem is in a
     subdivision of your area, then you should first refer it to the
     appropriate coordinator.  If that coordinator does not resolve
     the problem satisfactorily, then you can appoint a replacement.

     FidoNews 5-06                Page 19                   8 Feb 1988


     3.1.4 Formulating local policy

     It is your responsibility to formulate any local policies which
     are required for the smooth operation of your assigned area.
     Any policies you establish must not conflict with any policies
     established by a coordinator above you or with this policy
     document.

     3.2 Node list distribution

     The node list is posted weekly on Saturday, along with a
     "difference file" giving the changes for the week.  It is your
     responsibility to obtain the difference file from your
     coordinator every week and to distribute it to the coordinators
     below you.  The method of distribution is left to your
     discretion.  It is also desirable that you make it available for
     downloading by the general user, but this is not required.

     3.3 Newsletter distribution

     The newsletter, called FidoNews, is published weekly on Monday
     and is distributed as an archive named FNEWSvnn.ARC, where "v"
     is the volume number and "nn" is the issue number.  It is your
     responsibility to obtain this archive from your coordinator
     every week and to distribute it to the coordinators below you.
     The method of distribution is left to your discretion.  It is
     also desirable that you make it available for downloading by the
     general user in both archived an unarchived form, but this is
     not required.

     3.4 Network mail distribution

     It is your responsibility to ensure that network mail in your
     area is operating in an acceptable manner.  Exactly what this
     involves will depend on what level you are at, and will be
     discussed in more detail below.

     3.5 Anything else

     You should encourage sysops and users in your region to
     contribute to FidoNews.  If you receive any submissions, you
     should forward them to the FidoNews publisher.  Think of
     yourself as being a regional bureau chief on the FidoNews
     editorial staff.

     FidoNews and the node list are the glue that holds us together.
     Without them, we cease to be a community, and become just
     another random collection of bulletin boards.

     3.6 Specific coordinator procedures

     The above outlines the procedures which are followed by all
     coordinators.  We will now discuss additional procedures
     followed by specific types of coordinators.

     3.6.1 International Coordinator procedures
     FidoNews 5-06                Page 20                   8 Feb 1988


     The International Coordinator is appointed by the Board of
     Directors of the International FidoNet Association, Inc.  The
     Board of Directors can appoint a replacement for the
     International Coordinator at any time.

     The International Coordinator is responsible for the weekly
     creation of the master node list, and the creation of a weekly
     difference file listing node list changes.  This difference file
     is to be distributed to the various Zone Coordinators on
     Saturday morning.

     The International Coordinator is responsible for allocating
     zones, assigning zone numbers, and for appointing the Zone
     Coordinator for each zone.

     3.6.2 Zone Coordinator procedures

     A Zone Coordinator is responsible for dividing his zone into
     regions, assigning region numbers, and for appointing the
     Regional Coordinator for each region.  A Zone Coordinator also
     assigns a pool of numbers to each Regional Coordinator for use
     in assigning network numbers.

     A Zone Coordinator is responsible for locating nodes willing to
     act as zone gates for passing mail between his zone and the
     other zones, if at all possible.  A Zone Coordinator should not
     appoint any node as a zone gate unless the sysop of that node is
     willing and able to provide reasonably reliable interzone mail.
     Zone gates are highly desirable, but if provided they must be
     reasonably reliable.

     A Zone Coordinator maintains the list of administrative nodes
     within his zone.  The administrative nodes will always have a
     region number the same as the zone number.  For example, the
     administrative nodes for Zone 3 will always be in Region 3.

     A Zone Coordinator may use administrative node addresses for
     whatever he likes, except that any node number which is the same
     as another zone number is reserved for the zone gate to that
     zone.  For example, in Zone 3 the network address "3/2" is
     reserved for use by the zone gate that passes mail from Zone 3
     to Zone 2.

     A Zone Coordinator may not assign a region number that is the
     same as any other zone number.  This is because administrative
     regions are, by definition, present in all zones.

     3.6.3 Regional Coordinator procedures

     A Regional Coordinator is responsible for approving new
     networks, assigning network numbers, and for appointing a
     Network Coordinator for each network.

     Each Regional Coordinator will be assigned a pool of numbers to
     use when assigning network numbers.  A Regional Coordinator
     should never assign a network number outside of this pool, and
     FidoNews 5-06                Page 21                   8 Feb 1988


     should never assign the same number to more than one network.
     If a Regional Coordinator assigns all of the numbers in his
     pool, he should apply to his Zone Coordinator for additional
     numbers.

     A Regional Coordinator should try to avoid the needless
     proliferation of networks.  Networks should not be allocated on
     any basis other than technical and practical considerations
     relating to network mail operations.  For example, persons
     wishing to establish networks on the basis of special interests
     or for company mail should be encouraged to investigate the
     alternatives, such as echomail conferences and point networks.

     A Regional Coordinator is responsible for maintaining the list
     of independent nodes within his region.  This will consist
     primarily of those nodes which are not within the coverage area
     of any network.  There are, however, certain cases where a node
     should not be a member of a network, such as a commercial system
     with a large volume of traffic which would clog the network.
     The resolution of such special cases is left to your own
     discretion.

     If several independent nodes in a region are in a "clump", then
     the Regional Coordinator should encourage or require them to
     form a network.  Refer to the sysop procedure on forming a
     network for more details.

     Note that this does not mean that a Regional Coordinator should
     encourage the formation of trivial networks.  Obviously, one
     node does not make a network.  The exact number of nodes
     required for an effective network must be judged according to
     the circumstances of the situation, and is left to the
     discretion of the Regional Coordinator.

     It is the responsibility of a Regional Coordinator to ensure
     that the networks within his region are operating in an
     acceptible manner.  This does not mean that he is required to
     operate those networks; that is the responsibility of the
     Network Coordinators.  It means that he is responsible for
     seeing to it that the Network Coordinators within his region are
     acting responsibly.

     A Regional Coordinator is obligated to maintain direct and
     reasonably frequent contact with the networks in his region.
     The exact method of accomplishing this is left to the discretion
     of the Regional Coordinator.

     3.6.4 Network Coordinator procedures

     A Network Coordinator is responsible for assigning node numbers
     to any nodes within his network which are not managed by a Hub
     Coordinator.  A Network Coordinator is also responsible for
     allocating any hubs within his network and for appointing a Hub
     Coordinator for each hub.  If a Network Coordinator assigns any
     Hub Coordinators, then he also assigns a pool of numbers to each
     Hub Coordinator for use in assigning node numbers.
     FidoNews 5-06                Page 22                   8 Feb 1988


     It is the responsibility of a Network Coordinator to receive all
     inbound mail for nodes in his network and to forward it to its
     recipients.  How to accomplish this is left to the discretion of
     the Network Coordinator.  However, there are a few exceptions:

     1) Once in awhile a node will try to make a "bombing run"
     (sending one message to a great many nodes).  Bombing runs are
     considered to be annoying, and may be dealt with accordingly.

     2) Occasionally a user will appear who receives a great deal of
     traffic.  If a single node is receiving enough mail to interfere
     with mail delivery to the other nodes in his network, then his
     Network Coordinator can refer him to his Regional Coordinator
     for reassignment as an independent node.

     3) The most common source of routing overload is echomail.
     Echomail is a nice invention, and offers great benefits, but it
     cannot be allowed to degrade the ability of FidoNet to handle
     normal message traffic.  If a node in a network is routing large
     volumes of echomail, the sysop can be asked to either limit the
     amount of echomail, or even to stop routing his echomail
     completely.  The design of echomail is such that it is a simple
     matter to do either of these.

     A Network Coordinator is responsible for assigning any
     additional mail events which may be required for operation of
     his network.  Any node in a network may be excommunicated for
     failing to observe these additional mail events.

     A Network Coordinator may appoint a node as the outbound gateway
     for his network if he so desires and if one can be found.  In no
     case should a node be appointed as an outbound gateway unless
     the sysop of that node is willing and able to provide reasonably
     reliable service.  Note that a Network Coordinator is not
     required to appoint an outbound gateway.  If a Network
     Coordinator chooses to appoint an outbound gateway, then it is
     left to the Network Coordinator to establish any rules,
     policies, and procedures relating to its use.

     3.6.5 Hub Coordinator procedures

     A Hub Coordinator is responsible for assigning node numbers to
     nodes in his area.  Each Hub Coordinator will be assigned a pool
     of numbers to use when assigning node numbers.  A Hub
     Coordinator should never assign a node number outside of this
     pool, and should never assign the same number to more than one
     node.  If a Hub Coordinator assigns all of the numbers in his
     pool, he should apply to his Network Coordinator for additional
     numbers.

     It is the responsibility of a Hub Coordinator to receive all
     inbound mail for nodes in his hub and to forward it to its
     recipients.  How to accomplish this is left to the discretion of
     the Hub Coordinator.  However, the same exceptions apply here as
     for a Network Coordinator.

     FidoNews 5-06                Page 23                   8 Feb 1988


     A Hub Coordinator may have additional duties, as assigned by his
     Network Coordinator.

                             Chapter 4

                      RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES

     The world not being perfect, sometimes troubles crop up.  Any
     organization larger than a cub scout pack needs some sort of
     grievance procedure, and FidoNet is no exception.

     The FidoNet judicial philosophy can be summed up in two rules:

      1) Thou shalt not excessively annoy others.

      2) Thou shalt not be too easily annoyed.

     In other words, there are no hard and fast rules of conduct, but
     reasonably polite behavior is expected.  Also, in any dispute
     both sides are examined, and action could be taken against
     either or both parties.  ("Judge not, lest ye be judged!")

     In any case of annoying behavior the person to complain to is
     the coordinator of the person who is annoying you.  For example,
     if you have a problem with a point or a user you would complain
     to his sysop, or if you have a problem with a Regional
     Coordinator you would complain to his Zone Coordinator, and so
     on.

     If the coordinator you complain to fails to resolve the problem,
     then you can complain to his coordinator.  For example, if you
     had a problem with a Hub Coordinator, you would first complain
     to his Network Coordinator.  Then if the Network Coordinator
     does not resolve the problem, you would complain to his Regional
     Coordinator.

     Do not ever skip over a coordinator when filing a complaint.
     That in itself is annoying.

     4.1 Case Histories

     A few actual case histories of past disputes may be instructive
     to show general procedures and methods.  Names have been left
     out to protect the guilty.

     4.1.1 The Case of the Crooked Node

     A sysop of a local node was using network mail to engage in
     unethical business practices.  His Network Coordinator became
     very annoyed at this, and dropped the local from his node list.

     The local appealed to his Regional Coordinator for assignment as
     an independent node.  The Regional Coordinator, on checking with
     the Network Coordinator, decided that the Network Coordinator
     was within his rights to be annoyed.  Independent status was
     denied.
     FidoNews 5-06                Page 24                   8 Feb 1988


     4.1.2 The Case of the Hacker Mailer

     A sysop of a local node made use of file attaches for extra
     users to mail himself the USER.BBS file from several local
     boards.  The sysops of these boards felt annoyed at this, and
     appealed to their Network Coordinator, who agreed and dropped
     the offending node from the node list.

     The Regional Coordinator was not consulted.

     The International Coordinator did not intervene.

     4.1.3 The Case of the Network Mutiny

     Several local nodes became annoyed with their Network
     Coordinator for failing to provide services.  They complained to
     him, but nothing was done.

     They appealed to their Regional Coordinator, who decided that
     they were justified in their annoyance and accepted their
     application for a new network number.

     4.1.4 The Case of the Bothered Barker

     A local node became annoyed with his Network Coordinator for
     failing to provide services.  Repeated complaints to his Network
     Coordinator did not satisfy him, so he appealed to the
     International Coordinator.

     The International Coordinator, on seeing that the Regional
     Coordinator had not been consulted, dismissed the complaint out
     of hand.

     The local node submitted his complaint to his Regional
     Coordinator, who investigated the case and discovered that there
     was some justice to the complaint.  He advised and assisted the
     Network Coordinator in configuring his system to provide an
     improved level of service to the local nodes.

     The Regional Coordinator also decided that the local node was
     being too easily annoyed, in that he was expecting services not
     normally required of a Network Coordinator.  The local node was
     informed as to the true duties of a Network Coordinator, and was
     advised to lower his expectations.

     4.1.5 The Case of the Busy Beaver

     A local node which was operated by a retail establishment was
     engaged in making "bombing runs" to mail advertisements over
     FidoNet.  His Network Coordinator felt annoyed and handling the
     outgoing traffic for a commercial operation, and asked the local
     node to leave the network.

     The local node applied to the Regional Coordinator, and was
     granted status as an independent node in his region.

     FidoNews 5-06                Page 25                   8 Feb 1988


     4.1.6 The Case of the Sysop Twit

     A patron of various local nodes had been roundly recognized by
     all sysops as a twit.  The user obtained his own system, became
     a sysop, and applied for a node number.  The Network Coordinator
     denied the request.  No appeals were made.

     4.1.7 The Case of the EchoMail Junkey key key

     A local node became enamored with EchoMail and joined several
     conferences, routing his outbound mail through his network.  He
     then started an EchoMail conference of his own and began
     relaying EchoMail between several systems, again routing it all
     through his network.

     His Network Coordinator observed that network performance was
     becoming seriously impaired.  The offending node was told to
     hold it down.  A compromise was reached whereby much of the
     EchoMail traffic was no longer routed through the network, and
     routed EchoMail was limited to twenty messages per night.  No
     appeals were made.

     4.1.8 The Case of the Bouncing Board

     A local user decided to establish a node to promote a worthy
     charity.  The machine being used was also used for various other
     activities during the day, and the sysop was often called away.
     His coworkers would often forget to bring the board up at the
     end of the day while he was away, so the node was often down for
     extended periods.  The Network Coordinator, on finding the node
     unable to receive mail, would mark it as down.  The sysop would
     return, restart the board, and ask to be reinstated as a node.

     The Network Coordinator eventually decided that the sysop was
     not able to maintain a reliable system, and removed him from the
     node list completely.  Future requests for a node number from
     the same sysop were turned down.  No appeals were made.

     The Apple Core
     Alan Applegate
     The Short Line, 1:104/36 (Mail Only)

     I've given a lot of thought lately to starting my own column here
     in FidoNews.   I  contacted Dale Lovell (FidoNews Editor) shortly
     after his first editorial appeared  in  FidoNews 5-01,  and after
     some  difficulty  getting started,  here I am in all  my  written
     glory.

     For the overly curious, I  operate a mail only node,  formerly an
     Opus system until I grew tired of my users.   I  am Editor of Net
     104  News (a twice-quarterly newsletter for the Denver net),   as
     well as a quarterly  newsletter  for my employer.  I  am proud to
     have  written  the documentation for one  of  the  most  powerful
     software  packages available to FidoNet:  BinkleyTerm.    My last
     appearance in FidoNews was issue 4-25, where I sputtered on about
     archiving programs.

     Although I'm proud of what I write, believe me, I do not consider
     myself a world class writer, or anything even close.

     In  upcoming columns,  I  hope to cover a wide variety of  topics
     from software reviews, to giving a good dose of  mindless dribble
     on current issues.   I   will always  welcome  your  comments and
     feedback; send your input to me at the node address listed above.
     Flames  will  not be dignified with a response;  general comments
     will be replied to if warranted, and as time allows.

     I promised Dale that I would shoot for bi-weekly with the column,
     we'll see how that unfolds.  Now on to column number one.

                                 ----------

     I  had written-up my first column for FidoNews several weeks ago,
     and although the column is still timely, I've decided to shift it
     down a couple of weeks in favor of something more appropriate.

     In  my  introduction,   I   mentioned  "some  difficulty  getting
     started."   I was referring to getting off to a rough start in my
     attempts  to  communicate  with Dale  Lovell  about  starting  my
     column.

     Although I'm no old timer to FidoNet, I'm also no spring chicken.
     I'd like to believe,  however accurate or inaccurate, that I have
     played  and  continue to play a role in the shaping  of  FidoNet.
     What's  been  built  here  is  a  marvel  of  modern  technology.
     Inexpensive,    real-time,   rapid,   easy,   convenient  written
     communication at our fingertips.   Inexpensive is the one element
     that  strikes  me most;  that,  and being rapid.   I  can send  a
     message overnight (or even quicker) to a friend on the other side
     of the country for less than  the cost of a postage stamp.   If I
     FidoNews 5-06                Page 27                   8 Feb 1988


     wanted  to get the same message there by conventional means,  say
     Federal Express, I'd drop a ten-spot every time I got the urge to
     communicate.

     No,   FidoNet  isn't  going to be  threatening  Federal  Express'
     dominant role in overnight delivery, or closer to our genre,  MCI
     Mail and other such services.   It's not that the potential isn't
     there, it's our system.

     When  trying  to contact Dale about my column,  I  sent at  least
     three messages over the course of two weeks or so.   I  never did
     receive a response back from Dale.   Since I personally witnessed
     my  mail being sent to Dale's SEAdog,  I  assumed that  he  might
     harbor  some sort of antagonism toward me for some reason,  and I
     dropped the idea of writing a column.

     A  week or so ago in a burst of renewed interest,  I  decided  to
     ship-off one more message  (my fourth)  to Dale to 'give  him one
     more chance' to explain the reason he never wrote me.   I believe
     I said something to the effect that he 'owed me  an explanation.'
     Not  10  minutes after I crashed the message to him in the  early
     morning  hours,  I  received  a response back via crash mail that
     plainly stated that it was his fourth response...

     He  explained  that he normally routes his outbound mail  through
     someone  in  his  net,  and was certain (I believe  he'd  already
     checked) that the mail did make it out of his net, and we assume,
     to my local net coordinator.  I never received the mail.

     After sending a message to my coordinator (a very dedicated man),
     I  remembered  that he had  had some problems with his hard  disk
     over  the past few  weeks,  and the responses could  simply  have
     slipped through the cracks.

     There is not a single point to this article, but several.

     First,  FidoNet is not a for-profit system.  It works most of the
     time because it just happens to.   No one "owes" anyone anything.
     People volunteer, and they are expected to carry out their duties
     or pass along the baton to someone else.   That doesn't mean that
     our   systems   are   always  free  of   hardware   or   software
     problems...that's  part  of  the nature of  our  hobbiest  roots.
     PROBLEMS DO OCCUR.

     Second,  when problems occur, be patient.   Just because it would
     appear  that there's some sort of obvious problem  or  situation,
     doesn't  mean  that  one's  assessment  is  necessarily  correct.
     Patiently investigate where the problem might be, but don't point
     fingers.  WHEN PROBLEMS OCCUR, BE PATIENT.

     Third, just because you don't get a response from someone doesn't
     mean  they  hold anything against you.   People  are  busy,   and
     sometimes don't get around to responding.  Occasionally, messages
     are  accidently  deleted  before one has  a  chance  to  respond.
     Sometimes, as in my case, people DO respond,  you just don't know
     it because you never got the response (see the first item).  WHEN
     FidoNews 5-06                Page 28                   8 Feb 1988


     YOU GET NO RESPONSE, DON'T ASSUME ANYTHING.

     I learned the hard way I guess, and in the process,  kind of made
     an  ass  out of myself (I always reserve the right to  do  that).
     Dale was particularly understanding,  and sent me a  considerate,
     patient response (and I finally received it).   He could just  as
     easily have told me where to stick my FidoNews columns.

     People too often do just that...respond to flames with more fire.
     Folks,   two  wrongs  do  not make a right...one  of  the  oldest
     proverbs in the book.

     In most of the documentation I write (including this column,  see
     my introduction)  I say,  "Flames not dignified with a response."
     I try my hardest to hold by that.   I  may write a response  then
     erase  it,   just to get it out of my system,  but generally,   I
     simply don't respond.   I  refuse to stoop to the level of people
     who insist upon tearing apart what I say.

     Sending flames does no one any good.   What the person is  trying
     to  say is lost because it's so heavily engulfed  in  flames, and
     the person who receives the fireball  is too busy screaming about
     it to make an appropriate response.  This is not productive.

     I don't mind constructive criticism.   I  strive  to do well with
     whatever  it  is  that I do.   Constructive  criticism  helps  me
     improve and understand.  But the minute the match touches the can
     of  Sterno,  forget it.   I'll take  my criticism like I take  my
     pizza...room temperature.

     So  I've decided not to respond to flames.   Now all I need to do
     is  be  a little more careful about starting them  in  the  first
     place.   My apologies to Dale...he's obviously a nice guy.  After
     all, my column's in print, isn't it?

     See you again in another couple weeks.
