MENSANS_ONLY Echo Notice

Christopher Baker
1:374/14, Titusville_FL_USA

                    MENSANS_ONLY Echo

MENSANS_ONLY is open to any verified member, past or
present, of any Mensa organization anywhere.

MENSANS_ONLY is not connected with American Mensa, Ltd.
[The High IQ Society], or any other Mensa organization
anywhere. MENSANS_ONLY has no opinions. Any opinions
expressed are those of the writer and any replier.
MENSANS_ONLY exists solely to provide a convenient forum
for electronic conversation between accepted members of any
Mensa organization. Any other inference you may glean from
perusing this Echo is all in your head, which is where it
should stay.

It is Hosted and Moderated from Rights On! in
Titusville_FL_USA at 1:374/14. It is intentionally withheld
from the FidoNet Backbone distribution system and is
offered for point-to-point links only. Any Backbone system
discovering this Echo traversing their system should
immediately remove it and notify anyone sending or
receiving it through them to desist unless said Backbone
system is an active and verified participant of
MENSANS_ONLY.

Anyone may read the traffic in this Echo but only verified
members may post in this Echo. Non-members interested in
more information about Mensa are directed to the general
Mensa Echo of the same name [MENSA] available from the
FidoNet Backbone and Moderated by Dave Aronson of
1:109/120.

Sysops who link into MENSANS_ONLY agree to abide by the
access restrictions above. The content of that Echo is not
restricted to any single topic or idea.

The number of systems linked to this Echo and the volume of
traffic in this Echo varies. Traffic is generally light
which is typical of non-Backbone, special interest Echos.

Anyone interested in linking into MENSANS_ONLY, should send
Netmail to: Christopher Baker at 1:374/14 {Rights On!,
Titusville_FL_USA}.

The following is a list of primary links for M_O:

[Zone 1:] 109/120 114/74 135/71 374/14 374/98 380/7 387/31.
Zone 2 is also connected thru the Netherlands courtesy
of Frits Spieker at 2:286/115. [thanks, Frits!]

The Sysops of the above systems may link others into
MENSANS_ONLY based on the acceptance of the restrictions,
imposed above, by the link requesting Sysop.

Anyone requiring a direct feed or further information
should send Netmail to me at 1:374/14. Rights On! is a 24
hour system currently at 9600+ bps. It is at 9600+ HST/V32 on
a USR Courier HST dual standard courtesy of their Sysop
Purchase Plan.

A FidoNet historical compilation on CD-ROM in the works

by Carlos Fernandez Sanz
2:341/70, 2:31/62 2:341/79 2:341NC

This is simple a short request for FidoNet related stuff.
I'm compiling a CD-ROM with all the Fido stuff I can get
my hand on. I have already found a good nodelist collection
(many thanks to Jan Vermeulen) and all the FidoNews (thanks
to Jan again). I also have many pictures from very well
known and not so well known sysops.
I would like to include more stuff such as local pointlists,
local policies, old backbone.na's, and so on.
The CD will of course be free of charge to everyone (other
than the cost of the blank CD-R).
Any submittion will be very welcome. Please send them to:

cfs@emporium.subred.org
2:341/70, 62, 79 (do not route!)

even snail mail is ok. I will return every disk I receive.

SKEPTIC Echo on the Zone 1 Backbone!

Christopher Baker
Rights On!, 1:374/14

             SKEPTIC Echo is alive and well!

SKEPTIC is a Backbone Echo that originally sprang forth
from the San Francisco area. It now originates from Zone 3
in Hawthorndene, Australia under the Moderatorship of Jackson
Harding at 3:800/857. Co-Moderator is David Bloomberg in
Springfield, IL at 1:2430/2112.

If any of you or your Sysops are interested in obtaining
this Echo, you or they should contact their regular,
Backbone Echo source! SKEPTIC has appeared in FIDONET.NA
[now BACKBONE.NA} since 2 May 92.

SKEPTIC is devoted to examination and report of paranormal
and fringe-science claims. It has NO official or unofficial
connection to CSICOP {Committee for the Scientific
Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal} but has a similar
philosophy. Claims are not rejected on a priori grounds but
rather are investigated by objective and critical inquiry.

The Echo is now fully activated and waiting for those with
an interest in the mission stated above.

Complete information about the Echo may be found in the
current issue of the EList and the ELRules files.

Come and join us in the pursuit of knowledge! [grin]

TTFN.
