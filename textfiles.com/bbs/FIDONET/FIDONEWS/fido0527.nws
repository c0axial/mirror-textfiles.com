     PROPOSED AMENDMENTS

     Introduction:

     As a member at large on the Board of Directors of IFNA I am
     proposing this set of amendments in response to requests from my
     constituents and observations on the growth of FidoNet.

     The growth of IFNA and proliferation of amateur networking in
     general requires that IFNA accommodate a larger set of Networks
     then was originally anticipated.  The set of amendments
     presented here resolves current and anticipated organizational
     difficulties, and removes IFNA from direct control of individual
     nodes or networks in a zone

     Representation and voting rights of individuals in the IFNA
     networks is expanded and clarified in the set of amendments
     under IFNA MEMBERSHIP.

     The method for resolving disputes within the zones is modified
     in the GRIEVANCE set of amendments, to better represent the
     rights of IFNA members.

     The ZONE amendment represents the old "FidoNet in North America"
     returning to a non-political (perhaps anarchistic) network, and
     expands IFNA to allow "other nets" to join.

     When the Constitution of the United States of America was being
     prepared the problem of how to govern a group of independent
     States while at the same time allowing the States to rule
     themselves was addressed.  The resulting constitution seems to
     have been reasonably workable.  These amendments draw heavily on
     the concepts used in the Constitution.

     IFNA currently faces a similar set of problems:  Networks which
     would like to be able to communicate but can't accept the
     detailed polices of IFNA (similar to States rights in the
     original Union);  Individuals who feel that they are not
     represented by IFNA but are in the IFNA Nodelist (Voting
     Rights);  A grievance procedure which does not permit individual
     Sysops to vote, or in any way select, the Judicial system they
     operate under (Federal vs State law).  The attached amendments
     attempt to resolve these areas of dispute.

     Overview:

     The proposed amendments expand IFNA organization into the
     FidoNews 5-27                Page 2                    4 Jul 1988


     equivalent of a high level governing body in a way which does
     not interfere with the freedom of the Zones being governed.
     Essentially it sets the rules which allow diverse networks to
     coexist and communicate.  Zones are treated similar to
     individual states with independent governments and laws, but
     which accept a basic set of rules for coexistence and retain all
     rights not explicitly granted to IFNA.  That is, IFNA governs
     ONLY by rights granted to it by the Zones.

     The proposed structure places IFNA at the top of a confederation
     of Zones, with each Zone representing a unique Network or set of
     Networks.

     The Zones may be geographical, political (including network
     politics) or organizational.  Each Zone is free to establish any
     set of operating procedures which it chooses, as long as it
     meets a fixed set of IFNA requirements for IFNA representation,
     publication of it's Nodelist, and adherence to technical
     constraints for interfacing with other Zones.

     The IFNA MEMBERSHIP set of amendments defines the criteria for
     individual membership in IFNA (not membership in a ZONE), and
     specifies an individuals voting rights at the IFNA (not ZONE)
     level.

     The GRIEVANCE set of amendments describe the grievance
     procedure for ZONE level grievances.

     The ZONES set of "amendments" represent a set of rules for
     current ZONES in the net, and other networks wishing to join
     IFNA.

     IFNA MEMBERSHIP AMENDMENT summary:

     This amendment modifies the criteria for an individual to become
     a member of IFNA.  The germane points here are that anyone
     wishing to support IFNA may become a member.  It is not
     necessary to be an operator of a system to be a full voting
     member of IFNA.  Dues are waived for those contributing
     significantly to IFNA.

     AMENDMENT:

     In BY-LAW 1.(b) -- change the definition of associate member.

      Old wording:
         "(b) Associate Member.  Any person who is not eligible to be
         a Regular Member, but who is interested in electronic
         communications, is eligible to be an Associate Member by
         paying required dues.  Associate Members have all of the
         rights of a Regular Member except the right to vote.

      Amended wording:
         (b) Associate Member.  Any person who is not eligible to be
         a Regular Member, but who is interested in electronic
         communications, is eligible to be an Associate Member by
     FidoNews 5-27                Page 3                    4 Jul 1988


         paying required dues.  Associate Members have all of the
         rights of a Regular Member.  The membership committee will
         establish a set of criteria to recognize significant
         contributions to IFNA.  Any person meeting these criteria
         is exempt from the dues requirement for the period
         established by the Membership Committee.

     GRIEVANCE AMENDMENT summary:

     This amendment assumes that the methods of grievance resolution
     within a ZONE have been tried and has not been resolved in a
     manner satisfactory to the IFNA member.

     The rights of an IFNA member in this context are limited to
     matters involving IFNA.

     When the Zone joined IFNA it agreed to a set of rules and
     procedures.  Only those rules and procedures agreed to between
     the Zone and IFNA may be the basis of a grievance to IFNA.

     AMENDMENT, new BY-LAW N2:

         N2.  A Grievance Committee is hereby established.
         Membership consists of one member (1) from each Zone in
         IFNA, and one member from the Board of Directors.  Each
         Zone member will serve for a term defined by that Zone, but
         not to exceed five (5) years.  The member from the Board of
         directors will have a term of 1 year, and will be elected
         by the Board of Directors.

         The Grievance Committee will hear and resolve all grievances
         involving IFNA and IFNA members within a Zone which have
         not been resolved within thirty (30) days to the
         satisfaction of the IFNA member.

         The Grievance Committee will resolve the grievance within 30
         days.  The resolution will be binding on the person filing
         the grievance and on the Zone.  Resolution will be based
         upon the then current articles of association of IFNA and
         the agreement between IFNA and the Zone.

     ZONES AMENDMENT summary:

     This amendment represents the agreement between Zones and IFNA.
     It limits the power of IFNA to the administration of the
     interactions of Zones (networks), while at the same time
     returning IFNA to a central position of acting as a distributor
     publisher of a set of Nodelists which are available to ALL Zones
     in IFNA.  It will likely result in a large amount of flames, but
     essentially it "pulls IFNA back" to the administrative role,
     leaving the operation and policies of the Network(s) to the
     Network(s).  It also allows for a large political structure
     which can supply a lot of service without getting into the
     Network itself.  This should surely please a large amount of
     people.

     AMENDMENT:

     IFNA recognizes the need to expand the method by which Networks
     may join IFNA.  IFNA also recognizes that telecommunications is
     rapidly advancing, and different networks with different
     organizations, policies, and telecommunications mechanisms will
     arise.

     DEFINITIONS:

     ZONE:  An autonomous network which has joined IFNA.  NODELIST:
     The set of documents which define a Network at the ZONE level.

         Each Zone must file an agreement which defines the set of
         interactions it will allow IFNA to have with the Zone, this
         set of interactions must be acceptable to IFNA and defines
         the jurisdiction IFNA has over the Zone.

         Zones 1, 2, and 3 will operate under the current set of
         rules, regulations and policies of IFNA for a period not to
         exceed six (6) months from the adoption of this amendment,
         or until an agreement between IFNA and the Zone is reached
         which is agreeable to both, whichever comes sooner.  If the
         Zone and IFNA do not reach agreement within the allotted
         time, the Zone will be removed from the IFNA nodelist, but
         all IFNA members in the Zone will retain membership voting
         rights.

         A Zone applying for IFNA membership must meet the following
         criteria:

             1.  Be an operational Network with over fifty (50)
     nodes.

             2.  Be a Network which is not operated for profit, and
     which allows public access as defined by IFNA.

             3.  Establish a grievance procedure within the Network
     for IFNA members to follow for resolving any grievances
     involving IFNA.

             4.  Present to IFNA a set of individuals from within the
     Network to fill the required IFNA organizational positions.  The
     method of selecting these individuals is determined by the
     Network.

             5.  Have an existing Nodelist, Network Map or other set
     of documents which define the Network.  Deliver this document to
     the Vice-President of Technical Operations, and deliver updates
     periodically as agreed to by IFNA.  This document will be
     referred to as the Nodelist.

     This Nodelist need not conform to the current nodelist format(s)
     in use by IFNA at the time of application (IFNA realizes that
     not all networks use the current format) but it must contain
     enough information to allow telecommunications between the
     FidoNews 5-27                Page 5                    4 Jul 1988


     Network and other Zones. The Vice-President Technical Operations
     will determine if the Nodelist is sufficient.

             6.  Establish an operational gateway for
     telecommunications between the Network and other IFNA Zones.

             7.  Agree to abide by the policies, procedures, rules
     and regulations of IFNA for all matters pertaining to IFNA.
     That is, actually be a Zone in IFNA while retaining all rights
     not in the agreement with IFNA.

         The Board of Directors will establish a "ZONE COMMITTEE" for
         including all changes to current operating procedures, and
         modifications to the current set of BY-LAWS, such as BY-LAW
         24 which defines the voting divisions, to accommodate this
         expansion of IFNA.

         The Vice-President Technical Operations, the chairman of the
         FidoNet Technical Standards committee, the current ZoneGate
         operator for Zones 1, 2 and 3, and four (4) additional
         members appointed by the Board of Directors will be the
         initial members of the ZONE COMMITTEE.  The ZONE COMMITTEE
         will have no more then three (3) months to prepare these
         changes.  Upon completion of the changes the Election
         committee will prepare ballots to be mailed to all IFNA
         members for voting on the changes.  The ballot will contain
         the full text of the changes and a single choice -- "accept
         or reject".

      If the vote of the IFNA membership is reject, then:

             1.   Each Zone in the IFNA nodelist will revert to
     operation under "FidoNet policy 3" published by Tom Jennings,
     and IFNA will stop all operations involving the zones, regions,
     networks and nodes except for preparation and distribution of
     FidoNews, the Nodelist, and the Nodediff.

             2.  The duties of the Region Coordinators will be
     restricted to distribution of the Nodelist, Nodediff, and
     FidoNews and processing of updates to the nodelist. ALL updates
     from the individual networks will be accepted and processed.

             3.  The Network Coordinators will operate their Networks
     as they choose within the constraints of Policy 3.

             4.  Individual nodes will operate their nodes as they
     choose within the constraints of Policy 3.

     BBS Games:

     Well i guess you all know that online games can be a real drag.. They
     eat up disk space and memory. You have to use a front end to generate
     the pcboard or rbbs files for the name and baud. They are sometimes
     hard to set up and most of them have bugs in them that causes your
     system to hang up..           ^
                                   |
                        HAS THIS HAPPENED TO YOU?

     Well i have just the thing for you opus sysop's!

                       ChessLine (CHESS-NET)

     James Brown and myself have developed one of the best online games
     around.. It's called CHESLINE and i just wanted to tell you a little
     about it.

     ChessLine was developed for the sysop who has everything.. This system
     has everything we could think of ..
     here is a list of a few of the options:
     1.SYSOP ONLINE (REAL-TIME) PLAY WITH USER
     2.NETMAIL FEATURE FOR NATIONAL CHESSMAIL
     3.USER AGAINST USER
     4.CHAT WHILE ONLINE PLAY IS RUNNING

     This system is written in assembler and uses no more than 64k and
     has doubledos and deskview conventions already in it for multi-tasking
     games. It has its own ansi-interpreter so you dont have to load
     ansi.sys.

     REVISED E-MAIL GATEWAY SUPPORTS MORE SYSTEMS
     by Daniel Tobias
     1:380/2

        A couple of months ago, I released a program called GATEWAY to
     allow FidoNet sysops to exchange mail with online services.  Now,
     this program has been taken over by my employer, Softdisk, Inc.
     (the publisher of diskmagazines SOFTDISK, LOADSTAR, and BIG BLUE
     DISK, and the upcoming MacDISKWORLD) as an official product.  The
     latest release (1.10) has many enhancements over the earlier one.

        The major new feature:  In addition to CompuServe and The
     Source, gatewaying to GEnie is also supported.  There was much
     demand from users for this feature, due to the much lower cost of
     using GEnie as compared to the others.  GEnie gatewaying supports
     mail and forums as with the other two, with the added feature of
     allowing both inbound and outbound file attaches via GEnie's
     "XMODEM" file attach capability.

        In addition, the CompuServe script file has been modified to
     work with the revised forum software that went into effect this
     May, and some other changes, improvements, and bug fixes have
     been made.

        The way GATEWAY works is by finding messages in your netmail
     area that are properly addressed ("Genie D.TOBIAS" for GEnie ID
     "D.TOBIAS" for instance), and writing them to text files in a
     standardized format; then, a script file (requiring Datastorm's
     PROCOMM-PLUS to run) logs in to the remote system, sends the
     outbound mail and fetches anything inbound; and then GATEWAY
     takes over again and sticks the incoming messages into the
     netmail area.

        Forums work similarly; all new messages on a given SIG that
     you wish to follow are posted in a message area on your board,
     and any messages you enter are sent out to the SIG.  Due to
     copyright considerations, it is not recommended you make
     commercial SIGs accessible to your users; but this feature can be
     helpful in your own personal perusal of SIG messages, which you
     can now do offline in a sysop-only message area from your console
     rather than "while the meter's running" on a commercial service.

        Where private E-Mail is concerned, though, there should be no
     legal problems to setting your board up as a gateway to let your
     users send mail to friends on commercial systems, and get replies
     back; the online services don't really have any claim to the
     copyright of private messages, since E-mail privacy laws prohibit
     their disclosure to anyone other than the sender, recipient, or
     sysop, hence the services would have no way to register a
     copyright (which would require submission of the text of the
     message to the U.S. Copyright Office).  At any rate, others
     (DASnet and Mnematics, for instance) have gatewayed E-Mail into
     CompuServe and The Source just like GATEWAY does, and the
     services haven't complained yet.  Why should they; they make
     money on the deal, since you've got to log in at their normal
     rates to transfer the messages.  (You still save, since you don't
     FidoNews 5-27                Page 8                    4 Jul 1988


     have to pay online rates while you're composing or reading
     messages.  But they can't complain about that; most online
     services are full of messages advocating and supporting the use
     of automated scripts for offline message handling.)

        Provisions exist to charge the cost of sending and receiving
     E-mail messages against the Fido/Opus "credit" value in the
     user's record, to allow accounting and charging for usage.

        One more change:  The previous versions of GATEWAY were strict
     shareware, with a payment requested if you like them.  Lots of
     people downloaded or requested the program, but to date nobody
     has paid for it.  This is suitable to me as a private hobbyist,
     but since GATEWAY is now an official Softdisk product, they
     understandably would like to see some money come in for it.
     However, I absolutely hate booby-trapping programs; I've seen
     some programs around the net that do ugly things like generate
     long distance netmail messages to the program author, disable
     themselves after a given system date, and arbitrarily cripple
     their capabilities in various manners.  I don't like that; I'd
     prefer to distribute my programs in their fully-functional form
     to let users give them a complete workout, without fear of
     bizarre side effects from the built-in traps.  But on the other
     hand, it seems unrestricted shareware doesn't really work in the
     Fido world.  The result is a compromise.  GATEWAY 1.10 has been
     released in its fully functional form, except that, as
     distributed, it includes a brief note in all messages it
     transfers stating that an unregistered copy of GATEWAY is being
     used, and the sysop is expected to register it if he or she
     continues to use it beyond a trial period.  A similar note shows
     on the sysop console when the program is run.

        On payment of a $50 registration fee, you will receive an
     encrypted "Key" file.  Put it in the default directory from which
     you will run GATEWAY, and the program will recognize that you're
     a registered user (with a unique registration serial number), and
     it won't give any of the "Unregistered" messages.  Registered
     users will also be informed of updates and other news through a
     GATEWAY newsletter I intend to publish, and can use upgraded
     versions with the same "key" file.  (If we make an upgrade major
     enough to change the units digit of the version, as from 1.00 to
     2.00, we reserve the right to charge an added upgrade fee to
     registered users, but then again we might not.  All lesser
     upgrades can always be used free of additional registration
     charges.)

        What's coming up in later versions?  I've had a request to add
     more flexible custom gatewaying capability.  As it is, you can
     set up gateways for systems other than the three supported by
     writing your own scripts to exchange messages in a generic file
     format the system defaults to.  However, the capability of using
     a "template" file to define custom file formats to suit the needs
     of other systems would be desirable, and might allow GATEWAY to
     be set up for exchanges with all sorts of systems, like
     university and corporate networks, etc.  I didn't get a chance to
     implement this now, but I'll be working on it, so you can expect

     it to be added to an upcoming version.

        GATEWAY is downloadable in the file GATE???.ARC (the last three
     digits will change to reflect the version number) from SOFT FIDO
     at (318) 222-3503; it's in file area 6.  Bark and WaZoo file
     requests (to node 1:380/2) will work as well.

        I'm making plans to attend the FidoCon in Cincinnati, and will
     be available there to discuss remote system internetworking,
     distribute copies of the latest version of GATEWAY, and take
     suggestions for future improvements.  Be There!

                  Mensa Echo Conference Continues To Grow

       The three echo conferences related to Mensa have shown
     continued growth over the past two years, and since I've been
     hosting two of them for several months now, I thought some of you
     might like to know how they're doing.

       The three conferences are MENSA, MWM, and MENSANS_ONLY.
     The last is hosted by Christopher Baker at 135/14, and is
     restricted... please contact Chris if you're a Mensan and are
     interested in hooking into that conference.  The first two are
     international and local conferences, respectively.  One needn't be a
     Mensa member to link into either of these echo conferences, but
     you'll have to find your own link... right now I haven't the time to
     learn another software package, and we're already trying to figure
     out how to handle distribution of the MENSA echo to 33 systems.
     I'm sure that if you make arrangements with one of the systems
     already participating, they can advise you on how to link in.

       Many of you have heard about Mensa, but, for those who haven't,
     a short explanation of the organization's purpose is appropriate here.

       Mensa is an international organization with only one requirement
     for membership--a performance on a standardized I.Q. test (or
     certain alternative tests, such as the CEEB, SAT, GRE, LSAT, etc.)
     which puts a person in the top 2% of the general population.
     American Mensa has over 53,000 members, and there are another
     15,000 members in other countries.  There are Mensans in 98
     countries throughout the world.

     MENSA's purposes
          1) to identify and foster human intelligence for the benefit of
             humanity
          2) to encourage research in the nature, characteristics, and
             uses of intelligence
          3) to provide a stimulating intellectual and social environment
             for its members

     "MENSA" defined
          Mensa is Latin for "table."  We are a round-table society that
     makes no distinctions as to race, color, creed, national origin, age,
     or eco-nomic, educational, or social status.  Only intelligence
     matters.

     Here's the latest list of systems that I've been able to compile from
     messages over the past few months.  Please keep in mind, though,
     that some sysops have varying restrictions:  our board, for instance,
     requires a $10/yr. maintenance donation in addition to proof of
     Mensa membership.  I did not seek the prior permission of any of
     the sysops of these boards to post this list, so if there are any
     problems with the list, they're not to blame... I am.  The list was
     compiled 19 June 1988.

       The conference was founded by my friend and mentor in BBSing,

     goals, as well as assume the responsibility of the position of
     Programs Officer for Metropolitan Washington Mensa.  Since my wife

     almost two years ago, it has grown slowly from less than 20 nodes
     to well over 33.  I hope to see it continue to grow.

                     SEA vs PKWare -- What's It About?
                           by Ben Baker -- 44/76


          I suppose  most of you know by now know that System Enhance-
     ment Associates  (SEA) is  suing Phil Katz and PKWare.  There has
     bee a  lot of  comment (I  hesitate to call it discussion) on the
     suit in conferences in FidoNet and the commercial services.  Most
     of what  I have  read gave  me the  impression  that  the  writer
     thought about  it for  at least 30 milliseconds, then flamed!  So
     what's it really about?

          First, a  little history.  In CP/M days, there were a number
     of utilities  for compressing  and decompressing  files, based on
     the Huffman  coding technique.   The  most popular were called SQ
     and USQ,  but there  were several variations.  There was at least
     one utility  called LIB,  which did  not do compression (remember
     the total memory space was only 64K, and CP/M used at least 4K of
     that), but  it did collect files, "squeezed" or otherwise, into a
     single file so that they could be treated as a unit.

          When MS-DOS  came along, many of the old CP/M utilities were
     ported.   Among them were several (often incompatible) variations
     of SQ/USQ.   Our own Tom Jennings ported LIB to DOS.  DOS BBS op-
     erators then  had all  the functionality  they had  in CP/M; they
     could compress  files, and  they could  pack them  into "library"
     files, in  separate steps  of course.  But DOS wasn't memory poor
     like CP/M.   The  climate was  right for  something "new."  Enter
     Thom Henderson.

          Henderson, one  of SEA's principals, borrowing from concepts
     developed by  Brian Kernigan,  wrote a  "library"  utility  which
     overcame a limitation of LIB by using a distributed directory in-
     stead of  a fixed-length  directory at the front of the file.  It
     also had  built-in Huffman code compression, eliminating the need
     for SQ/USQ.   He  called it  ARC.   Almost overnight, it became a
     standard among bulletin board operators.

          As ARC  developed, it  acquired a number of useful features,
     encryption and  LZ compression, for example, stirring interest in
     the commercial  marketplace.   Thus ARC became one of those prod-
     ucts marketed both commercially and as shareware.

          In an  effort to encourage porting ARC to other systems such
     as Unix,  SEA made  the sources for ARC available for download on
     its bulletin  board.   These files bear the SEA copyright notice,
     and before  people may  legally do  anything with them other than
     study them,  they need  SEA's permission.  When someone asks per-
     mission to port, it is granted with three restrictions on the re-
     sulting program:  it may  not be sold, it may not be used commer-
     cially and  a copy  must be  submitted to  SEA for redistribution
     (under the  same restrictions).  Someone may also use the sources
     in a  commercial product,  but in this case, a source license fee
     is charged and the resulting program may NOT be a general purpose
     file-archiving utility.

     FidoNews 5-27                Page 14                   4 Jul 1988


          A short  time later  PKXARC appeared  on the scene, followed
     quickly by  PKARC.  Katz hadn't followed the rules, but then, ARC
     wasn't making anybody rich as shareware, and Katz wasn't address-
     ing the  much more  lucrative commercial market SEA had developed
     for ARC,  so SEA overlooked it.  Then, last year, an ad for PKARC
     and PKXARC appeared in "PC Tech Journal" on the page facing SEA's
     ad for ARC.  Katz' ad priced the product a dollar and a half less
     than ARC,  and even  went so  far as  to make comparisons to "the
     other archive utility."

          SEA then sent a "cease and desist" letter to PKWare, propos-
     ing the  following agreement:   PKWare would withdraw all commer-
     cial advertising  and cease  attempts at commercial distribution,
     and SEA  would forgive past violations and grant PKWare an unlim-
     ited cost-free  license to  market  its  derivative  products  as
     shareware with a non-commercial restriction.  Katz refused.

          I suspect,  though I  don't know, that there were additional
     exchanges between  SEA and  PKWare.  Were it me, I would have de-
     manded a  source license  fee and royalties on sales to date.  In
     any event, no agreement was reached, so SEA filed suit.

          As I  understand it,  there are four counts in the complaint
     (not necessarily in this order): 1) "look-and-feel" violation, 2)
     copyright violation,  3) trademark violation, and 4) unfair trade
     practice.  Let's look at them one at a time.

          I placed  "look-and-feel" first  because it's fairly easy to
     dismiss.   I personally don't think SEA has a prayer on this one.
     "Look-and-feel" is  the current  legal buzz-word  so SEA's lawyer
     tossed it in, but I can't imagine it applying in this case.

          A concept  or idea cannot be copyrighted, but the expression
     of a concept or idea sure can, and a program is the expression of
     one or  more concepts or ideas.  If the development of PKXARC and
     PKARC were entirely independent of ARC, merely employing the con-
     cepts used  there, then the second count cannot be sustained.  If
     it can  be shown  that Katz obtained or had access to the sources
     for ARC,  then he  probably infringed  on SEA's copyright.  If it
     can be  shown that  he actually  used them in developing his pro-
     grams, then  he IS  guilty of copyright infringement.  Even if he
     translated them  to assembly language, he violated the copyright.
     Translating a novel from English to German without the permission
     of the  author and/or  publisher is  prohibited by copyright laws
     world-wide.  Same principle.

          Is ARC a trademark?  As relating to archiving or compression
     utilities, you  bet.   Does the  name "PKARC" violate that trade-
     mark?   Suppose I  developed a new soft drink and began marketing
     it under  the name  "BBCOKE."  How quickly would I find myself in
     court?  And isn't there a network developer using the name "ARC,"
     and are  they in jeopardy?  No!  If I were a fuel dealer, I could
     sell all  the "Coke"  (a coal  derivative) I  wanted and the Coca
     Cola Co.  couldn't care less.  This one will be tough for Katz to
     beat.

     FidoNews 5-27                Page 15                   4 Jul 1988


          Why is a trademark important, anyway?  A company spends con-
     siderable effort, not to mention money, establishing a trademark.
     I mentioned  Coke in the previous paragraph.  Did anyone have any
     doubt what  company I  was referring to?  This is called "product
     recognition" and  it is  an extremely valuable asset.  SEA has it
     with "ARC,"  but that didn't just happen.  They worked at it.  My
     "BBCOKE" would  be trading  on product recognition it didn't earn
     on its  own.   If I then sought out advertisements for Coca Cola,
     and placed ads of my own, claiming (whether right or not) "BBCOKE
     is better  than the other cola" next to all I could find, would I
     be engaging in fair trade?  Do you think I could argue that I was
     not trying  to deliberately  undermine the effect of their adver-
     tising and  take advantage  of their recognition?  Do you suppose
     that Coca Cola would give me the courtesy of a letter before they
     fell on  me like  a ton  of bricks?   If  any of  the first three
     counts can be sustained, then the fourth probably should be also.

          A recent  "PC Week"  article has caused considerable comment
     on this  issue.  One mentioned a "fact" cited in the article that
     PKWare was  a four-employee  company operating out of Katz' home,
     and implied  this was  a Goliath  attacking a David.  The "facts"
     may or  may not be true.  The article was so badly written and so
     poorly researched  as to  call into  question all of its "facts."
     The fact is that SEA is a four-employee (counting the principals)
     company.  The Wayne (not Fort Wayne) NJ corporate address is Andy
     Foray's home.   These  are TWO  small companies.  Neither has the
     resources to  pursue a  protracted legal  battle.  I think we can
     expect a reasonably quick resolution.

          So how does it all affect you?  Will you still be allowed to
     use a  Unix port  of ARC?   Of course.  Most ports have been made
     with permission,  and even those which have not are not encroach-
     ing on  SEA's commercial  market.   Will you still be able to use
     PKARC or  PKXARC copies  you obtained through shareware?  You did
     so in  good faith  and SEA  has neither the resources nor the in-
     clination to  search you  out and persecute you.  In fact, should
     Katz lose the suit, he might still be granted a license to market
     his programs as shareware.  For that, we'll have to await the fi-
     nal resolution.  SEA is NOT being vindictive.  They are trying to
     protect what they regard as a valuable commercial asset.

          If you  are a  shareware software developer, as I am, it may
     affect you  in a different way.  The lawyers have been telling us
     for several  years that  the copyright  laws do  in fact  protect
     products marketed  as "shareware."  But so far, no court has said
     so, and the courts of the land are the final arbiters of the law.
     A win  for SEA,  particularly on  the second  count above,  would
     place all,  big or small, on notice!  Shareware is NOT public do-
     main!   A win  for Katz, on the other hand, is a signal to share-
     ware authors, and a source of inexpensive, quality software might
     well dry  up.   If that  happened, it  would hurt  developers and
     users alike.  Think about it.

                          BACK TO THE BUSH!

     By Todd Looney, Sysop
     Vietnam Veterans' Valhalla
     143/27, San Jose, CA.

     The Vietnam  Veterans' Valhalla in San Jose, California has  been
     working to  put together  a trip for  interested  parties back to
     Vietnam.   We've really  been pleased  with the  responses  we've
     received  since  our  last  article  announcing  this  once-in-a-
     lifetime trip back to Vietnam. You don't necessarily have to be a
     Vietnam veteran to go with us, everyone is invited!  We expect to
     have a  group of  about   fifty people.   We  are  now  accepting
     deposits for  those who  want to get their reservations in early.
     We have  scheduled this  event  to  depart  from  San  Francisco,
     California on  Saturday, January  21, 1989.    We  will  be  gone
     fourteen days  and return  on Saturday,  February 4,  1989.   The
     itinerary has been established already as listed below, but there
     is still  room for  change so  if you  have an idea, let us know,
     we'll try  to work  it in  if it  is at all possible.  Things are
     starting to  really look  up for  the "Back  to the Bush" trip to
     back to Vietnam!

     All the amenities are includes as follows:

                            Round trip air fare
                          All hotels and lodging
                            Three meals per day
                 All transportation (Rail/Bus/Boat/Plane)
                  Daily sightseeing tours of your choice
     (there are many tours available in every city, or you are free to
                           go off on your own!)
       Cultural performances sponsored by the Vietnamese government
                      Vietnamese and Cambodian visas
           (yes, you can take a sightseeing tour into Cambodia!)
        English-speaking tour guides and interpreters in every city


     All  you  have  to  furnish  is  your  body,  your  international
     passport, and have your inoculations up to date (ouch!).

     Here's what we have planned for you:

     Day 1     Depart San Francisco via Japan Airlines

     Day 2     Arrive Hong Kong
               (Overnight stay because we will arrive too late to
               depart for SE Asia that evening.  There will be a
               breakfast in Hong Kong before we leave)

     Day 3     Depart Hong Kong for Bangkok, Thailand
               (We will need to stay two nights in Bangkok to get
               all of our visas issued so you will have plenty of
               time for a little R&R!)

     Day 5     Depart Bangkok, Thailand for Hanoi, Vietnam

               (We will stay two days in Hanoi)

     any changes as they become available.  The whole trip, everything
     listed  above  (all  transportation,  lodging,  food,  and  daily
     entertainment) will  only cost $2,000.00 each (try and do that on
     your own,  we are  getting some  great group  discounts!)  We are
     still making  every attempt to get this price cut down even more.
     The more tickets sold, the less the price will be for everyone so
     don't wait until the last minute!  Start saving now, sign-ups are
     starting this  month! All  deposits are  refundable, but  certain
     restrictions will  apply with  regard to  withdrawal less than 30
     days prior scheduled departure date.

     Don't put off saving .  This is a trip of a lifetime!  To do this
     by yourself  would bankrupt  you so  take advantage of this group
     discount!

     I have started a new echo called: ZYMURGY.

     For those of you who are interested, ZYMURGY is the art of Beer
     Making.  Since 1979 homebrewing beer has been legal in most
     states.  In Ohio you can brew 100 gallons of beer per year for
     personal use.  If you are married or there are multiple adults
     living in your household, you can brew up to 200 gallons per
     year.  (That's a lot of homebrew!)

     You cannot sell your homebrew, but you can give away as much as
     you like.

     With the equipment and ingredients available today home brewing
     is easy, inexpensive, and good!  The motto of the American
     Homebrewers Association (of which I am a member) is:

                 Relax, Don't worry, Have a homebrew!

     I could very easily write a book about homebrewing but there are
     already several good books available and why re-invent the
     wheel.  One of the best books available is: "The Complete Joy of
     Home Brewing" by Charlie Papazian.  This book can be
     found/ordered at your favorite local bookshop.

     Since last September, I have brewed over 40 gallons of high
     quality beer.  Just ask my friends!  Everyone was a skeptic until
     the first sip.... Then it was WOW! you really made this!

     I started this echo in the hopes that I could find other
     homebrewers out there and we could swap techniques and recipes. I
     also started this echo for the new homebrewer that wants to learn
     about homebrewing.  If you are interested in obtaining the
     'ZYMURGY' echo, drop me a note at 108/62.

     Well the ball is in your court.  Remember: Relax, Don't worry,
     have a homebrew!
