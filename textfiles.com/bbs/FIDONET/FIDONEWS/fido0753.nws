     =================================================================


     Holy shit. It's the end of the year. One week later than Phil
     thought it would be. Of course, our President thought Pearl
     Harbor Day was in September. What's one week among friends?

     I'm certainly pleased to still be here. I'm happy to see you're
     still there as well.

     1991 promises to be a really interesting year. Even in FidoNet.
     (My apologies to the national media, who hope to keep us thinking
     that the only thing happening anywhere is in the Persian Gulf!)
     This will probably be the year that we figure out how to manage
     the network without becoming either total fascists or total
     anarchists. I haven't a clue what we'll arrive at, but the trip
     is one that you won't want to miss!

     There will be changes in the way I do things here, too.

     I expect to turn over my "Current Versions" section to someone
     in the FidoNet Technical Standards Committee in a week or so.

     I'm going to slap together a piece of code that will be able to
     extract articles from netmail messages, so that you'll be able
     to use available low-cost routing techniques to send me stuff.
     When I have that together, there will be an update to ARTSPEC
     and I'll let you know.

     I'm sure disappointed that Henry Clark hasn't sent me any more
     feature requests for Binkley (or a picture of Honey, for that
     matter) in the past couple of weeks. I'll try to get him going
     again. Any more aspiring columnists out there?

     I'm already 9 minutes past deadline, so I'll bring this
     worthless little soliloquy to an end. But not without wishing
     all of you the very best of New Years, for you and yours.

     Cheers,

     Vince

                         OTHER NATIONAL BBS LISTS

     Dave Appel, USPA C-20451
     Just a user on 1:231/30

          Although there is no other national BBS list as complete
     as the NODELIST, I have not seen the NODELIST available for
     download on any non-Fido bulletin board systems.  Most of our
     local nodes don't even offer it for download.
          According to the notice at the beginning of the NODELIST
     any use by anyone other than a Fidonet sysop is not allowed.
     It appears to me that people are afraid that someone will make
     some money from distributing it.  As a result, end-users
     looking for long distance boards to explore, via PC-Pursuit or
     Starlink, are unable to use the best national BBS list.
          I don't have a solution to this.  But I do have an
     alternative suggestion.  Having your BBS listed on one of the
     other national BBS lists could go a long way in garnering out-
     of-town callers for your system.
          One such list is the "Darwin" list.  This file can be
     found on many boards as USBBS??.ZIP.  USBBS79.ZIP had a little
     under 1500 entries as of 12/1/90.
          You can get your BBS on the Darwin list by calling their
     BBS at 202-547-3037, and answering Script #1.  The requirements
     for being on this list are: being MS/PC-DOS oriented, at least
     a 2400 baud modem, at least 60 megabytes of disk, and
     substantially 24-hour service (not counting maintenance and
     net-mail of course).
          Another national list appears in Computer Shopper
     magazine.  This list is maintained by FOG, The International
     Nonprofit Computer Users Group.  Electronic versions of this
     list are available on the FOG Roundtable on GEnie and from the
     FOG BBS.
          The requirements for being on this list are having at
     least 10 megabytes of disk and 24-hour service.  You need to
     submit your information every 3 months or your listing
     automatically gets deleted.  All computer systems may be
     listed, not just IBM compatible.
          You can send your BBS information to FOG at
              PO Box 3474,
              Daly City, CA  94015.
              FAX: 415-755-3482.
          Their e-mail addresses are:
              GEnie      : OFFICE.FOG
              MCI-MAIL   : 347-8112
              CompuServe : 71561,570
              BBS        : 415-755-8315 (Leave a comment to sysop)
