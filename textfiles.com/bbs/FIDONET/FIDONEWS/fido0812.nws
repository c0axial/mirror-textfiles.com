     The following survey was submitted for a user on my system.
     He asks that persons interested in helping him with this
     thesis project please place this survey (a message on a local
     message area is the easiest) on their BBS, collect the
     results, and send them to him.  You could netmail them, or
     get in touch with me somehow, and I'll F'Req them from your
     systems, or something.  Thank you in advance for your
     participation.

     Glenn Caleval
     1:140/1

                          JUST ANOTHER FAIRY TALE?

     Once upon a time there was a group of friends and strangers who
     wanted to talk to one another through a magical wonder known in
     the arcana as Computer Communications.

     The original wizards of the mystic art commanded the forces of
     nature to bind them to another, a small coven of Touch Typists
     and Techies. And behold, it was good.

     Therefore the wizards proclaimed "let us prosyletize!" and they
     did. Soon the coven grew from a few to many. And then many more
     and many more until the group multiplied to cover the face of the
     Earth with their mystic arts and magical incantations. And still
     it was good.

     The group was a group but was not, and in that it was not was its
     strength and so it grew. In diverse places on the Earth did new
     groups both large and small appear, different each with its own
     strange customs and unusual deeds, yet all part of the first
     group. And together they would incant "F-i-d-o-n-e-t, ohmmmm."
     For that which tied them was fragile, little more than wire and
     strange numbers in a magical list.

     But for all the numbers and wire, a beast lurked in the midst of
     the group and the beast had a name and it was "Annoyance." For
     though the magic was powerful and shone forth in its awe, none
     would ever bleed from misuse of the force. No limb be torn, nor
     brow bruised by evil use of the magic. But still this one beast
     arose and many became obsessed with the name of Annoyance.

     Then darkly through the monitor spake a voice of darkness.
     "Policy," it said. "Policy will make us like unto one another and
     thus will we be rid of the beast."

     And there was much rushing hither and yon, and whispering and
     rumors of war and much ado about this new weapon, Policy.

     Said the Moderator, "And it shall say that I am the lord god of
     my dominions and none shall challenge me on penalty of echodeath!"

     Said the NEC, "And it shall say that no NC shall rise up against
     me lest Policy be brought against him and he shall surely rue
     that day."

     Said the REC, "And I shall be the master of all I survey and I
     shall know what is right in my principalities and I shall cause
     the underlings beneath me to walk in righteousness by the name of
     Policy."

     FidoNews 8-12                Page 8                   25 Mar 1991


     Said the ZEC, "Policy hath forsaken me to my doom and I shall
     never say what I think lest someone disagree with me."

     Said the NC, "We are not Annoyed."

     Said the RC, "We are not annoited."

     Said the ZC, "We are not amused."

     Said the frustrated sysop, "And I shall use the might of Policy
     to Vote, to Vote, and I shall be rid of all my frustration and
     rid of all those who would coordinate me."

     Said the Average Sysop, "Who are all these people anyway?"

     And concern begat discussion which begat debate which begat
     argument which begat bitterness which begat Policy. And no one
     got kissed before they got begat.

                                    ###

     PostLogue

     From Echopol to ZEC elections to the New Jerusalem of Policy 5,
     this fairy tale is no creative writing. FidoNet is a connection
     more than it is a group. Indeed, the individual systems in a
     given net differ more than they are alike, in views, in purpose,
     in modus operandi and often even in hardware/software
     configurations.

     We are not a homogeneous unit. We have two things that actually
     bind us: general purpose (to communicate) and general method (the
     nodelist). Beyond that it's work and as much good luck as we can
     get.

     The problems all the buzzing is intended to solve really do come
     down to matters of being annoyed. Sure foolish users or sysops
     can cost us all money, but if anyone thinks the power of policy
     will or should eliminate this annoyance their dream will be
     shaken when we wake up in the New Jerusalem. We will still have
     (and need to tolerate) foolish users and sysops.

     Giving sysops a vote will solve the problems, right? Join the new
     Coffee echo and have a smell. Giving sysops voting rights is
     going to cause considerably more problems than it could pretend
     to solve. Witness the ZEC elections.

     Annoyed sysops will vote, campaign, stir up bad feelings and
     replicate Z1_Election many times in the future. The Average Sysop
     will continue to wonder "Who are these guys anyway?"

     FidoNews 8-12                Page 9                   25 Mar 1991


     What problem were we trying to solve? Feeling helpless cause you
     didn't get your way? Just wait until some of those folks have a
     "mandate" and worry about not getting your way.

     Mad because the Moderator doesn't let you enter msgs about the
     price of candy in the tech echo? Electing a new one won't make
     much difference unless you all want a candy echo instead. So
     start a candy echo.

     All this aside it is my personal opinion that we can survive
     within the constraints of the most recent cut of Echopol and the
     newest proposed WorldPol/Policy5. But as we jump into the fray,
     perhaps a little fairy tale might be useful...

     FidoNet: 1:231/70.0

                           CIFC BBS List

         We here in net 231 have the opurtunity to participate
     in a new idea using FidoNet(r) technology. It's called the
     Central Indiana FidoNet Cooperative BBS List. It enables
     users to submit entries into a large database of BBS's using
     questionares for Qbbs/Ra/Sbbs.

         This idea was conceived of by a person name Casey
     Schaphorst of 1:231/240.0 (Falx Cerebri Amiga). He wrote
     the program that processes updates and publishes the lists.
     So far, the program creates three files. They are:
     LOCALBBS.ASC, SHORTBBS.ASC, and CIFC_RPT.ASC. All or which
     are sent out by the host node of the list.

         According to the date that this was written, there are
     seven things that a user may do to create an update to the
     list: Add, Change, Verify, Describe, Link A Subheading,
     Restore, and Delete. Like a said before, the updates are
     generated by the Qbbs/Ra/Sbbs questionare languages. There
     is a seperate questionare for each type of update. Around
     6:00am to 7:00am a batch file runs that will check to see
     if any updates have been made. If some were found, it will
     rename them, zip them up, and using a robot program, will
     send it to the host node (231/240).

         Right now.. It doesn't seem that the CIFC BBS List will
     get any farther than Central Indiana. The list is only limted
     to what we have right now. Hopefully it will expand to
     incorperate other nets around Central Indiana.

         I would like to know if there is anyone else that has
     experimented with something like this. Please feel free
     to netmail me or something. I'm at 1:231/70.0.
