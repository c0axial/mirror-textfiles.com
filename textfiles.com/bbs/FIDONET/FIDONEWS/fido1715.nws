                          The Backwaters of Fidonet
                                  Doug Myers

     Though I've lived in the same house since the late seventies, I seem
     to have drifted from the mainstream of Fidonet into its backwaters.
     Recently, I found that an echo I moderate, BFDS_MAIL, hasn't been
     getting out to the rest of FIDONET since the millennium change.  Now
     this isn't a major echo - it was established for a small group of
     people who still like to dabble in DOS batch files.  It's not even
     the main discussion area - most of the action is in the BATPOWER
     echo.  BFDS_MAIL serves primarily as a file announcement and
     administrative echo for the Batch File Distribution Service, a small
     File Distribution Network on the Filebone which specializes in the
     small utilities and programs which enhance batch files.

     I suspect that the echo has gotten lost one hop away from me.  My NC
     gets his echoes from David Moufarrege and, though I haven't made
     contact with David yet, the echo seems to be lost to nodes further
     up the line.  In the course of figuring out what happened to the
     echo, I discovered that I'm no longer getting such items as
     BACKBONE.NA, BACKBONE.WW, and BACKBONE.Z1B, though I still get the
     weekly NODEDIFF (with a few times missed).  In ftping the
     distribution lists, I find that BFDS_MAIL is still listed in the
     North American Backbone, but has been dropped from the Zone 1
     Backbone and the World Wide Backbone.

     So I've got some fixing up to do...

     I suppose I could write an editorial crying that FIDONET is falling
     apart, blaming everyone and his uncle for the botched echo handling
     and file handling, take my node down in protest, and just surf the
     internet for the rest of my life.  But I'll tell you why I won't:

     First of all, the small group of batch power nuts with which I
     associate ARE FIDNET.  Oh, not all of it... but they're the spirit
     of Fido.  The power of Fido has always been in the ability of small,
     specialized groups to work together in a manner of their choosing in
     ways which wouldn't be possible without the larger Fidonet
     structure.  Certainly the internet sports its newsgroups for batch
     file enthusiasts, but for some reason it doesn't seem as "homey" as
     the echo structure of FIDONET.  So the small little administrative
     echo is worth reestablishing just for the continued association of
     the small group using it.

     Secondly, I'm the guy who's drifted into the backwaters of Fidonet.
     When George Peace left Fidonet and connections to my local net
     began failing, I held onto the local net concept even though the
     evidence was in that one must make reliable connections to one of
     the major hubs in order to fully participate in Fido.  Both John
     Souvestre and Bob Seaborn offered me such free connections... all I
     needed to do was master the art of moving mail via the internet.

     But I had other things going on in my life, and I procrastinated.

     I suppose that getting my little corner of FIDONET working again is
     not going to be insurmountable - people here have always been
     generous in their helpfulness when I've paid enough attention to ask
     for the help.  And maybe this illustrates what FIDONET will need to
     remain viable for the future - just folks like me paddling out of
     the backwaters from time to time.

                                Editor Pro Tem
                                  Doug Myers

     There's a strong prospect that I'll elect to undergo heart surgery
     after April.  While I'm considered highly likely to recover from the
     surgery without complications, it is nevertheless major surgery and
     will require a few weeks hospitalization.  I posted this information
     in the FIDONEWS echo last week, seeking someone to serve as Editor
     Pro Tem in my absence, and was delighted to get offers from Bobby
     Queen and Peter Karlsson - two highly qualified individuals.
     I figured that since the surgery will probably be in May, I should
     accept the first credible offer so that I can get software and
     instructions to the Editor Pro Tem with adequate time to modify batch
     files and run a few practice editions.  Bobby's offer arrived
     first, so he got the nod; I've got to confess that if I'd seen both
     offers at once I'd have had a hard time deciding between the two :)

     This week, I'll be sending Bobby Queen an archive containing the
     software necessary to put out Fidonews.  Hopefully, I've made it
     easy to customize for his system with the notes I've put in the
     batch files, but there's time for us to talk back and forth to iron
     out any difficulties.  What I'll ask Bobby to do is put out Fidonews
     for the time I'm unable.  Most likely, I'll be back without undue
     delay, but in the event things go badly, I'll ask in advance for
     Bobby to either assume the Editor position or select an Editor if
     he's unwilling to do it permanently.  I'll also send Bobby the elist
     password for the FIDONEWS echo and ask him to take over as moderator
     in my absence.

     I've asked Peter Karlsson if he would mind my sending him the
     materials I send Bobby, to serve as a backup for him.  That may be
     overly cautious on my part, but why not avail myself of the
     dedication of these two individuals?

     For my own part, I'm confident that my absence from Fidonet will be
     only temporary.  Though I'm not a "perfect" heart patient (diabetes
     complicates things a little), I'm only 53 and in good health
     otherwise; the doctors estimate that my chances of coming through
     the surgery without complications are high.  Except for this small
     setback, my life is coming together nicely after a long divorce, and
     I'm making future plans assuming that I'll be around for quite a
     while :)

     Thanks in advance to Bobby and Peter for their service to FIDONEWS.
     I'll go into the hospital resting a little easier knowing the SNOOZE
     is in good hands.

     What: Welcome to the Net2410 Home Page!

     Where: http://oeonline.com/~garyg/net2410/


     This is the Net2410 Home page. Nice work here. Logo that is simple
     but gets the message across and buttons along the side of the page
     that change with each page to help you keep track of where you are.
     Here's a cut & paste of the main information available on this site.

     ---- cut
     Here you'll find:

     Listings of the Fidonet BBS systems in Wayne County, Michigan.
     Information on Fidonet & Net2410 for BBS sysops and users.
     Information for BBS sysops on how to join Net2410. Fidonet support
     files.

     We hope you enjoy your visit. Please check out some of our local BBS
     systems, we're sure you'll find one that meets your needs.

     ---- cut

      The first button is the main page, of course. :-))

      Choosing the second button will take you to the "About Net2410"
     page. The information is good here. Short, to the point and
     informational. An invitation is given to join the Net or call the
     BBS' in the Net.

      Choosing the Third button will take you to a "Support" page. This
     is mainly a download page for files, but has some good information
     and file descriptions as well. If I were to look at this page in
     interest of becoming a Sysop or joining Fidonet, I'd at least know
     what files I needed. :)

      Choosing the forth button was the only disappointment of the whole
     site. It is supposed to be the list of Systems in the Net, but it
     came up blank. :(  I'm sure this is being worked on.

      The fifth and final button is mainly for Sysops of the Net. It's
     the "Meetings & Elections" page. While this page might not be of
     interest to most, it does tell of a decision of Net2410 to eliminate
     their CRP. After reading this decision, I say "Hats off" to a Net
     that will work together to better the Net! :)

     All in all, a very nice page. Drop by when you have a chance and

     look this one over.

     THINGS WILL ROGERS NEVER SAID

      (but probably wishes he had)

     --Every teen-ager should get a high school education -- even if they
       already know everything

     --Some things that cost $5 to buy several years ago now costs $10
       just to repair

     --A synonym is a word you use in place of one you can't spell

     --Here's a new invention -- a solar-powered clothes dryer.  It's
       called a clothes line

     --Leaders go down in history -- some farther down than others

     --Any man who laughs at women's clothes has never paid the bill for
       them

     --For every judge operating in an official capacity, there are 100
       who are self-appointed

     --It is when we forget ourselves that we do things that are most
       likely to be remembered

     --The more you know, the more you know you ought to know

     --The argument you just won with your spouse isn't over yet



     So TRUE
     ---------------------------------
     Ever wonder why the IRS calls it Form 1040?

     Because for every $50 that you earn, you get 10 and they get 40,
     because of hidden other taxes on everything you buy.

                                Internet Hoax
                          Thanks to allica@juno.com


     1.  Big companies don't do business via chain letters.
         Bill Gates is not giving you $1000, and Disney is not
         giving you a free vacation. There is no baby food
         company issuing class-action checks. Procter and
         Gamble is not part of a satanic cult or scheme, and
         its logo is not satanic. MTV will not give you
         backstage passes if you forward something to the most
         people. Honda won't give you a new car either! You can
         relax; there is no need to pass it on "just in case it's
         true". Furthermore, just because someone said in a message,
         four generations back, that "we checked it out and it's
         legit", does not actually make it true.

     2.  There is no kidney theft ring in New Orleans. No
         one is waking up in a bathtub full of ice, even if a
         friend of a friend swears it happened to their cousin.
         If you are hell-bent on believing the kidney-theft
         ring stories, please see:
         http://urbanlegends.tqn.com/library/weekly/aa062997.html

         And I quote: "The National Kidney Foundation has
         repeatedly issued requests for actual victims of organ
         thieves to come forward and tell their stories. None
         have."  That's "none" as in "zero". Not even your
         friend's cousin.

     3.  Neiman Marcus doesn't really sell a $200 cookie
         recipe. And even if they do, we all have it. And even
         if you don't, you can get a copy at:
         http://www.bl.net/forwards/cookie.html
         Then, if you make the
         recipe, decide the cookies are that awesome, feel free
         to pass the recipe on.

     4.  If the latest NASA rocket disaster(s) DID contain
         plutonium that went to particulate over the eastern
         seaboard, do you REALLY think this information would
         reach the public via an AOL chain letter?

     5.  There is no "Good Times" virus. In fact, you
         should never, ever, ever forward any email containing
         any virus warning unless you first confirm that an
         actual site of an actual company that actually deals
         with viruses.  Try:  http://www.norton.com  And even
         then, don't forward it. We don't care. And you cannot
         get a virus from a flashing IM or email, you have to
         download....ya know, like, a FILE!

     6.  There is no gang initiation plot to murder any
         motorist who flashes headlights at another car driving
         at night without lights.

     7.  If you're using Outlook, IE, or Netscape to write
         email, turn off the "HTML encoding." Those of us on
         Unix shells can't read it, and don't care enough to
         save the attachment and then view it with a web
         browser, since you're probably forwarding us a copy of
         the Neiman Marcus Cookie Recipe anyway.

     8.  If you still absolutely MUST forward that
         10th-generation message from a friend, at least have
         the decency to trim the eight miles of headers showing
         everyone else who's received it over the last 6
         months. It sure wouldn't hurt to get rid of all the ""
         that begin each line either. Besides, if it has gone
         around that many times we've probably already seen it.

     9.  Craig Shergold (or Sherwood, or Sherman, etc.)
         in England is not dying of cancer or anything else at
         this time and would like everyone to stop sending him
         their business cards. He apparently is no longer a
         "little boy" either.

     10. The "Make a Wish" foundation is a real
         organization doing fine work, but they have had to
         establish a special toll free hot line in response to
         the large number of Internet hoaxes using their good
         name and reputation. It is distracting them from the
         important work they do.

     11. If you are one of those insufferable idiots who
         forwards anything that "promises" something bad will
         happen if you "don't," then something bad will happen
         to you if I ever meet you in a dark alley.

     12. Women really are suffering in Afghanistan, and
         PBS and NEA funding are still vulnerable to attack
         (although not at the present time) but forwarding an
         e-mail won't help either cause in the least. If you
         want to help, contact your local legislative
         representative, or get in touch with Amnesty
         International or the Red Cross. As a general rule,
         e-mail "signatures" are easily faked and mean nothing
         to anyone with any power to do anything about whatever
         the competition is complaining about.

     13) IBM is not giving away free computers because
         Netscape bought AOL.

     14) A little dog (or any picture) is not going to
         pop up on the screen if you forward an email to any
         number of people.

     15) Neither the GAP nor Abercrombie & Fitch are giving
     FIDONEWS 17-15               Page 10                  10 Apr 2000


         away free clothes or gift certificates.

     16) The US Postal Service is not going to stop
         printing Black Heritage Stamps because Black people
         are not buying them.

     17) I know this is a touchy one for some of you, and
         you and you alone know your relationship with
         Almighty God but, you will not go to hell or suffer some
         catastrophic event if you break the prayer circle.

     (PS: There is no bill pending before Congress that
          will allow long-distance companies to charge you for
          using the Internet.)

     Bottom Line ... composing e-mail or posting something
          on the Net is as easy as writing on the walls of a
          public restroom. Don't automatically believe it until
          it's proven false... ASSUME it's false, unless there
          is proof that it's true.

     Now, forward this message to ten friends, and you
          could win a chance to spend a day with Elvis Presley
          and Tupac Shakur :) tee-hee-hee

     a @ preceding an individual's name implies a virtual email
     address. The email is translated as follows
     firstlast@osirusoft.com will automatically route to the
     appropriate individual's email.  Anyone in this list will
     also receive routed notice of this feature.  In my case, it
     would still be joejared@osirusoft.com, but you get the idea.

     Also, as information is provided to me, I will be adding a
     latency field to each node, which is defined as the maximum
     time between when the message is received, and when it is
     sent on to other nodes, or available to be sent onward,
     defined in minutes. A latency of ! implies that there is an
     immediate response, and an attempt to deliver immediately
