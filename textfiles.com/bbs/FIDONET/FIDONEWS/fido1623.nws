     =================================================================


                            Conflicts of Interest

     The election for Zone 1 Coordinator is in full swing.  As of this
     writing, three candidates have been nominated and accepted, though
     the nominations are still open.  Individuals monitoring the election
     process have noted two instances where candidates my have a conflict
     of interest and have asked, properly, that potential improprieties
     be addressed and guarded against.

     The first potential conflict of interest involves me personally.
     This week, I accepted nomination as a candidate for the Z1C office.
     It was suggested that acting as Editor Pro Tem of Fidonews gives me
     an unfair advantage over other candidates, and that I should resign.

     This places me on the horns of a dilemma in that 1) I certainly want
     to maintain propriety as a candidate for Z1C and 2) I want to honor
     the prior commitment I made to Henk Wolsink to keep Fidonews
     flowing while he enjoys his vacation.  After due consideration, I've
     decided to put together Fidonews until the June 28th edition, thus
     honoring my prior commitment to Henk.  At that time, I will cease
     and turn all relevant material over to Henk.  At that point, my
     association with Fidonews becomes that of any other Fido member.

     In the meantime, I'll honor Fidonews' long-standing practice of
     publishing all articles submitted irregardless of political content.
     In practice, this means that any candidate or anyone supporting a
     candidate has my pledge that their own article will see publication.

     The second conflict of interest noted involves each of the other two
     candidates.  The Z1C election is not determined by direct sysop
     vote, but rather by the ten RCs of zone 1.  They have pledged to
     gather regional input and vote for Z1C according to this input.  The
     conflict is that each of the other two candidates are sitting RCs,
     and thus could "control" 20% of the effective vote.

     While it would be ideal if the election mechanics provided for a way
     to avoid this situation, I believe that we're too far into the
     election process to rewrite the mechanics.  The best course is to
     rely on these RCs pledge to vote for Z1C according to their region's
     input.  Dallas Hinton and David Moufarrage are principled
     individuals, and I'm satisfied that they will not resort to anything
     unscrupulous to win the election.  I've suggested to these
     candidates that they do their best to make their region's input
     known to all in the Z1_ELECTION echo and possibly have a neutral
     third party handle the gathering of input.

     Dallas Hinton's Z1C Candidate's Statement
     (originally posted in Z1Election)
     by Dallas Hinton (1:153/715)

     Hi All!

     In order to introduce myself to those of you who don't know me, or
     who only think they know me, here is some information which might
     help you. If you have questions to ask of me, I'll be pleased to
     answer.

     Who am I:
     =========

     I'm a 53 year old male (in Canada, my name can be used by people of
     either gender). I've been married to my best girlfriend for 30 years,
     and we have one special needs child (13 years old).

     I'm employed as a Computer Science and Career Preparation teacher
     with Grade 9-12 students (ages 15 - 19) in a large (1800+)
     multi-ethnic high school in Vancouver, BC.

     I am an elected executive member of the local teacher's union (3000
     members).

     What is my background:
     =====================

     I have run a full-time multi-line dial-up BBS since 1988, starting
     with Opus/Seadog and progressing to my current Max/Squish/Binkley
     setup.

     I have been an NEC and an NC of a large net (Net 153 was over 350
     members when I was NC), and am currently in my 6th year as RC of
     Region 17.

     I have been (or still am) an Alpha or Beta test site for Max, Squish,
     Binkley, Areafix, MsgEd, timEd, Xlaxnode, Wtrgate, and other minor
     software.

     I'm experienced at working with people, both volunteer and draftees.

     I have a good understanding of computer technology although I'm not a
     certificated technician.

     I teach Pascal but don't consider myself a programmer.

     I have a verifiable history of coordinating, and of letting the R17
     *Cs run their nets in their own way. I also have a verifiable history
     of stepping in when a node has complained (and proven) that a *C has
     behaved in an arbitrary and dictatorial manner. While I wouldn't
     FIDONEWS 16-23               Page 3                    7 Jun 1999


     describe a *C as ONLY a "nodelist keeper", I'm certainly in favour of
     a hands-off policy of coordination at any level.

     I have a verifiable history of helping nodes and *Cs with any aspect
     of FidoNet and/or computing whether by supplying software, advice, or
     consolation!

     Despite what you may think about my relationship with Ward Dossche, I
     get along with him reasonably well. I also get along with the other
     ZCs, as I do with the Zone 1 RCs.


     What do I believe:
     ===================

     I believe that each sysop should determine his/her own destiny in
     FidoNet.

     I believe that FidoNet is essentially an anarchy, even when we hold
     "democratic" or psuedo-democratic elections.

     I believe in being fair when dealing with people.

     I believe in being taking a global view.

     I believe in being polite and courteous at all times.

     I believe in doing the best I can.

     I'm willing to say "I don't know", but I believe in doing my best to
     find out.

     I believe in saying "I'm sorry" and "I was wrong" when that is true.

     I believe in leaving echomail transport methods alone, to operate
     when and how the transporters wish.

     I believe that policy complaints should be the last resort, but if
     someone has made a PC it should be dealt with as speedily as
     possible.

     I believe that PCs should be settled with the idea of fairness to all
     parties, not necessarily by who is "right".

     I believe that the Z1C is a coordinator, not a boss.

     I believe Policy 4 needs to be interpreted somewhat more broadly than
     has been past practice. I would like to see it re-written, but I
     recognize how difficult it's going to be to get it accepted. Although
     a majority of all RCs in all zones must approve consideration of a
     new version, I think we can do it.


     If I become Z1C, what will I do:
     ===============================

     FIDONEWS 16-23               Page 4                    7 Jun 1999


     I'm willing to continue the practice of automatic geographic
     exemptions as defined by Bob Satti.

     I'm willing to work with others to get (or keep) non-dialup BBSs in
     the nodelist by appropriate modifications to our formats.

     I will build and publish a summary of policy complaints as they are
     resolved.


     And finally:
     ===========

     I have a life outside FidoNet -- I'm not going to sit obsessively
     over the keyboard waiting for the next message to arrive! I do,
     however, check my mail regularly and I answer mail in a timely
     fashion.

                           Fidonet finally grew up

     I will take advantage of your "Editor Pro Tem Special."

     In regards to the conversation between Todd Cochrane and Joe Jarad
     and the "Empires", "Here, Here"!!

     Todd & Joe were discussing the refinement of the nodelist to reflect
     an actual "Fido-IP/Node" instead of a node number which represents a
     specific geographical area.

     There are two ways to employ this.  Method one: "Do It".  This is
     the most risky method because it violates Policy 4 (too many parts
     to mention). Method two: Submit a change to Policy 4 (OK, you can
     stop laughing now). We could always wait until the end of the
     elections and bring it up to the new Zone Coordinator.  However,
     with the way Fidonet has been run, I have no faith in the hierarchy.

     In all actuality, it is simple to make the transition now using
     method one. For instance, I received my node number (1:275/311) from
     1:275/0. However, I FTP all of my mail from another node in another
     part of the world. As long as a node has the -Unpublished- flag
     attached in the nodelist, it is impossible to tell where they really
     are.

     Incidentally, because I have a 'geographical' node number, Netmail
     never get's to me because I don't pull mail from my geographical NC.
     See, I have a Telnet/Web only BBS. I have a series of regular
     customers from all parts of the world, who access Fidonet mail
     through my system in a myriad of ways. Including reading Fidonews
     <bg>.

     Whether RC's, NC's, or other nodes like it or not, Fidonet is going
     to the Internet.  As a matter of fact, it's on the internet now.
     I'm not just talking about FTP'ing packets, I'm talking about "all
     of it".  I make Fidonet available via Telnet, QWK, & Web pages.  The
     problems with the nodelist we knew we would face in 1994 when the
     Internet Exploded, are being faced right now, and have been faced
     since (at least) 1996.

     In conclusion, simply making the pen and ink changes to the nodelist
     will make things run smoother for the nodes.  And isn't that what
     this "Amateur Network" is all about anyway?  Wasn't what the
     original intent by Tom Jennings?

     Lastly, in response to the gentleman who said that if a BBS didn't
     have at least one dial up line then they were not a real BBS.  "You
     can Telnet to my BBS like everyone else because a BBS by any other
     FIDONEWS 16-23               Page 6                    7 Jun 1999


     name is still a BBS."

     Let's fix the nodelist.

                            PROOFREADERS REPORT

     Last week's editorial reported a conversation in echomail between
     Joe Jared and Todd Cochrane.  In that editorial, I misspelled Joe's
     last name as "Jarad."  My apology, Joe!

     =================================================================


                              A Gaelic Beer Joke

     An Irishman walks into a bar in Dublin, orders three pints of
     Guinness and sits in the back of the room drinking a sip out of each
     one in turn. When he finishes them, he comes back to the bar and
     orders three more. The bartender asks him, "You know, a pint goes
     flat after I draw it, wouldn't you rather I draw fresh pints for you
     one at a time?"

     The fellow replies: "Well you see I have two brothers. One is now in
     America and the other in Australia. When we all left home we
     promised we'd drink this way to remember the days when we drank
     together. The bartender admits that this is a nice custom, and
     leaves it there. This fellow becomes a regular in the bar and always
     drinks the same way: he orders three pints and drinks them in turn.

     One day he comes in and orders two pints. All the regulars notice
     and fall silent, speculating about what might have happened to the
     absent brother. When the fellow goes back to the bar for a second
     round, the bartender says, " I don't want to intrude on your grief,
     but I wish to offer my condolences on your great loss." The fellow
     looks confused for a moment, then a light dawns in his eye and he
     laughs and says: "Oh, no, everybody's fine. I've just given up beer
     for Lent."

                            Candidate's Greetings
                  Douglas Myers, 1:270/720, doug@mdtnbbs.com
                         Zone 1 Coordinator Candidate

     Howdy!

     It's just polite for a candidate who wishes to represent you to
     offer some information on his background.  As a further matter of
     courtesy, I've tried to keep these remarks brief... but feel free to
     ask any questions in the Z1_ELECTION or Z1_POLITICAL echoes, or
     contact me at one of the above addresses.

     Though I've been with Fido since the eighties, ever since George
     Peace introduced Fido to Central Pennsylvania, most of my time was
     as a user.  In fact, the coordinator experience I have to offer was
     developed on another smaller network - Speakeasy, operating as zone
     18.  Speakeasy only had nine nodes when I joined it in 1988, only 30
     nodes when I was promoted to Zone Coordinator in 1992, and only 120
     nodes at the highest peak I can recall.

     Zone 18 in 1992 was a technical nightmare - echomail flowed
     sporadically, mostly because of a lack of stable hosts, netmail was
     nonexistent except as crashed, and there was no file distribution at
     all.  Even the nodelist was a hand-cranked affair.  In the process
     of working with folks to straighten all that out, I achieved
     considerable "trial and error" experience - not enough to impress
     the folks here on Fido who have put great systems together, but
     enough that I can talk nuts and bolts with them intelligibly.

     However, the technical experience gained there is not the main
     qualification I bring, as I believe that I could have run the net
     with considerably less technical knowledge.  The talent to
     accomplish all the changes already existed among the members of the
     net, and my prime contribution was in working with all these people
     to make it happen.  Maybe that's why the position was called
     "coordinator" rather than "governor."

     If elected as Zone 1 Coordinator, I'd like to focus on actions which
     would reverse the trend of declining use of Fidonet with a goal of
     actually showing some growth.  Emphasis would be in two main areas:

     1.  Retaining the traditional membership.  BBS sysops built Fidonet
         and, even though there are less BBS users, these sysops keep
         Fidonet dynamic.  Actions would include...
         ...supporting efforts to attract dial-up users on BBSes.
         ...continuing the recent trend of involving these sysops in the
            selection of coordinators.
         ...working with the coordinator structure to further dispel the
            perception that management of Fido is a closed process.

     2.  Finding the users who have fled to the Internet.  Though Fidonet
         has made excellent use of the Internet for moving mail, more
         support is needed for the pioneers who are offering BBS services
         (particularly echomail) to Internet users.  Many of these people
         would never hear of a BBS or Fidonet without our presence on the
         Internet.  I would continue the policy of automatic geographical
         exemptions, of course, so that Internet nodes may find
         connection irregardless of actual location.  I would continue
         efforts to facilitate the listing of Internet only nodes in the
         nodelist.
