     =================================================================

     Greetings,

     Is it not valid, that whatever happens in FidoNet world, some form
     of announcement is made in Fidonews?  Is FidoNews not for _ALL_ the
     users and 'whoever'?  The 'whoever' being whoever reads FidoNews!
     If so, than lets read what is happening in your Zone, no matter what.

     I have an interesting question, to which I have my own views, but
     hopefully the IC and/or ZCC or for that matter, anyone interested,
     can give a answer or two.  Ofcourse, this may have been debated in
     the past, without me being aware of it. If such, my excuse for asking.

     Q. Is it not true, that when a message appears in _any_ one of the
     Echo's, it is 'public domain'?  Please keep in mind, that when I
     refer to 'public domain' (PD), it is in reference to your editor to
     take such message from any echo, and publish it here in FidoNews.

     Lets have your views on the above, as it is an interesting aspect.

     Happy reading.

                             Conflict of Interest
                                Douglas Myers

     It's been over 30 years since I took a journalism course, and it was
     at Penn State, a university more known for its linebackers than it's
     journalists.  An ethical standard then, and still a good idea today,
     was for a writer to disclose any personal interest he may have in an
     article.  I have submitted such an article for publication in this
     week's edition of Fidonews - a news piece concerning the Zone 1 Echo
     Coordinator election.  You should know that I intend to run as a
     candidate if the office is to be determined by a sysop-level
     election.  I don't plan to campaign at the moment figuring such
     activity is better reserved until the election is actually set, but
     I do plan to inform.

     That's my potential conflict of interest.  Now let's discuss your
     conflict if you're a zone 1 sysop.

     There may not be another election for this position where the zone 1
     sysops may vote directly.  The reason, if I may paraphrase the
     analysis of one particularly eloquent writer in the ZEC echo, is
     that the last one sucked.  I've briefly discussed the last election
     in the article itself, but here I'd like to focus on one of the more
     significant objections: In the last ZEC election, only about 6% of
     the sysops in zone 1 cast a ballot. Opponents of an election for
     this office say it's because sysops are too apathetic to vote.
     Proponents claim that the "grunt" sysops just didn't get the word
     about the election.

     The decision on how the ZEC position is to be filled rests in the
     hands of the Regional Echo Coordinator's Council.  It's being
     decided right now, and there's still time for you, as a sysop, to
     have a voice in this decision.  If you have an opinion right now,
     you need only to get it to your Regional Echo Coordinator (REC).  If
     you don't know who he (or she) is, your own net's NEC or NC would be
     able to tell you.  If you want to hear what others are saying about
     this election, or if you want to express yourself in an interactive
     setting, join the ZEC conference.  ZEC (and all the other confereces
     mentioned in the article) are publicly available echos carried by
     the BACKBONE and FIDOSPINE and can be had wherever you get your
     echomail.

     In my opinion, the upcoming decision by the RECC goes beyond merely
     filling the ZEC position right now.  The ZEC is the only zone 1
     office to ever be decided by a vote in which all sysops were
     elegible to cast a ballot.  It was an experiment, and if the RECC
     decides that the experiment was a failure, then it's unlikely that
     "grunt" sysops will ever cast a ballot for a zone 1 office again.

     So now we come to your own conflict of interest:  if you've read
     this far, then you know what's going on.  You know what's at stake,
     FIDONEWS 15-38               Page 3                   21 Sep 1998


     and you know what you can do about it.  You can choose to act on it
     now, or simply let others make the decision for you.

     Hello Henk, congratulations upon being appointed Fidonews editor.

     Please feel free to publish this.

     Fidonet.  If you'd like to know more, or would like to subscribe,
     feel free to check out the link below.

                     The Zone 1 Echo Coordinator Election
                         Will there ever be another?
                         Douglas Myers    1:270/720

     The Zone 1 Echo Coordinator (abbreviated here as Z1EC or ZEC) is an
     obscure position, not often doing anything noticable to the average
     sysop.  If you've never heard of the office, don't be embarrassed -
     the chances are that you're in good company.  In fact, Zone 1 has
     spent much of the recent years without anyone doing this job at all.

     Why, then, is this office the most hotly contested in Fidonet?  Why
     does this position dominate the interest of Fido's political
     activists?  Why is this office so prominant (or notorious, of late)?

     The ZEC is basically an assistant to the Zone Coordinator, much the
     same as a Regional Echo Coordinator (REC) assists a Regional
     Coordinator (RC) and a Net Echo Coordinator (NEC) assists a Net
     Coordinator (NC).  As the title implies, the specific duties of the
     ZEC are related to Fido's echomail.  The ZEC is charged with acting
     as a Chairperson for the Regional Echo Coordinator's Council (RECC)
     and acting as a liason of sorts between the distribution services
     (Backbone, Fidospine, and others), the echo moderators, and the
     Echolist Keeper.  The job description goes into more detail than
     I've summarized above, but the summary should serve to illustrate
     that the duties themselves would not inspire the passionate and
     long-lasting debate current with the Fido Politicos.

     What has fanned the coals of this interest into a raging fire is Bob
     Satti's decision, as Zone Coordinator, to transform the position of
     ZEC from an appointed position to an elected position.  The last
     ZEC, Bob Kohl, became the first functionary in Fidonet to be elected
     in a zone-wide sysop-level election.

     But this may be the last time sysops at large in Zone 1 may ever
     have a direct vote in any election.  Both the proponents and
     opponents of such elections agree that the last one was
     disappointing:

     1.  Only about 6% of Fido sysops cast a ballot in the election.
         This has been blamed on multiple causes, ranging from sysop
         apathy to insufficient publicity for the election.

     2.  The election itself was vocal and time-consuming, with confusion
         over the preferential voting system used... and the results were
         considered tainted by some over allegations of multiple votes by
         at least one individual.

     3.  The elected candidate did not complete his term.  Instead, he
         removed from office by the RECC acting in conjunction with the
         ZC.  Charges are too numerous to mention here, but left some
         with a distrust of further direct elections.
     FIDONEWS 15-38               Page 6                   21 Sep 1998


     As it currently stands, the future of direct sysop voting is being
     considered by the RECC and the ZC.  An interim ZEC, Gary Gilmore,
     was previously appointed to conduct an election in the event that
     the ZEC could not complete his term.  He has assumed the interim
     position, but was instructed to hold off on the election until the
     RECC and ZC decide on the most appropriate way to fill the office.
     Zone 1 awaits this decision.

     What can you, as a sysop, do?  If you have strong feelings on how
     the next ZEC should be selected, tell your REC.  If you want more
     information or just want to watch events unfold, moniter the ZEC and
     the Z1C echos.  You may also want to moniter the Z1_ELECTION echo.
     Some discussion is going on there now and it's a likely choice for
     voting if there is to be another sysop-level election.  I get a
     surprising amount of "unapproved" information from what may not be
     an obvious place - the SUPER-BITCH echo.  And Z1_POLITICAL is
     another place to keep an eye on - It's not too active now, but a
     likely site for those "unmoderated" discussion if things heat.

     Finally, you could mention to your friends that there's a bit of
     background material right here in FIDONEWS.  A copy should be
     available from anyone's NC, and I'll attempt to summarize upcoming
     news in future issues.

     I am looking to learn more about operating a "point system" on
     Fidonet.

     There was a document out there making the rounds called "point.doc".
     Does anyone have a copy of this that they can forward to me?

     (In english please, I recently DID get  a copy of it in another
     language.  :-)  )

     If you have a copy of "point.doc" in english, could you send it
     along to me.

     If you run a 'point system' on fidonet, I would love to hear from
     you.

     Thanks for your help!
