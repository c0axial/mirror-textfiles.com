     A short issue today ... only two articles.  Doc Logger is
back, trouncing us for filling the snooze with internet stuff.
Of course, that is a bit better than sending an empty file ...

     I am bored with my board.  Need some new echos that are not
endless sniping of children over petty politics.  The
well run boards never seem to get involved in that nonsense,
they just collect, forward and deliver mail week after week,
month after month.

     Are there any echos where people talk about real things in
sentences that are over three words long?  Where the sentences
that they write are not just punctuation for endless lines of

quotes, quotes of quotes, and quotes of quotes of quotes?

     If so, where are they?

To All

Hello, my name is Jeremy Guthrie. I used to be NEC of 2207.
Sean Laurent and I had designed new nodelist specifications that
took a 3.3 meg nodelist down to 800K.  I had every piece of
administration software written up, nodediff generators, update
doors, etc... I had api's written in c++ and pascal.  I had a
converter to take the new and old formats and interchange them.
There was a browser for the new format and much more. I had a
solution for the nodelist problem.  In fact I was going to
release it all as public domain. When net 2207 was removed,
that  all changed.  I will be copyrighting the code and
specifications.

Why am I doing this? Because, Mark Lynch removed our new net
without even asking our side of an argument. He just pulled it
from us saying his approval of it was a mistake. I am a person
who likes to be dealt with personally, I consider it a show of
respect to deal with someone on such a matter. He did nothing
of the sort, so at that I refuse to let this go to the public.
I no longer run a board and do NOT want to return to 238 because
I face the same problems there. Net 238 follows the same course
as Mark did. Many there accused me of misleading Mark and then
couldn't prove it.

I had a great FREE solution to a big problem of FidoNet, but
because persons couldn't talk to me or try to be objective, I
refuse to help those who hinder me.

Just thought people had the right to know,

Dear Editorbeings;

This article is submitted by Charles Herriot of 1:163/110
who was able to drag Logger from his perch. Logger kept
raving about the William Kennedy Smith trial, trying to pull
a condom over his head, while shouting: "If it doesn't fit,
you must acquit." Roll da' flic, Sylvia....

Dear Reverend Visage,

You know, I think I was just plain puzzled by the fact that
millions of people were cheering wildly at the latest
trashing of justice in the Excited States. If, as Johnny
assures us, he didn't "play the race card" then we can
attach as much credence to *his* statement as we can to
Furhman's assertion that he didn't use the "n" word. The
verdict must give great comfort to women who are in abusive
relationships and they must be all asking themselves whether
their monster spouses have a spare nine million to beat the
rap.

I notice with dismay that Fidonews has been shilling for
Internet. The process started subtly with the editors
posting their Internet address in the masthead. The fact
that my printer treats the ampersand symbol as a formatting
command was only mildly annoying, but when whole pages were
given over to advice on where to find the best selections of
AntFarmMail I was aghast.

In Region 12, the Children's Crusade in net250 continues
unabated. Their last NC came painfully close to being the
first person to serve a full term in the last four years but
resigned in a petulant frenzy with seconds to spare. The net
is convulsed with battles over who has the rightful claim to
hijack Fidonet echomail funds to pay for Internet mail. As a
good and decent gesture, we should cross-link old video
feeds of The Friendly Giant to their mail supply. They won't
notice the difference, honest.

In my public service, African Killer Bee Watch type of
service, I can now report that the California Spam 'N
Timmies have advanced as far as Victoria, British Columbia.
It seems that there is a quotaholic troll or two in Victoria
who have been thrown into apoplexy over my assertion that
their messages contain drooling cascades of quotes followed
by short, thrusting, grunts. In one of life's many ironies,
the only messages that they have *ever* written where
original text exceeds plagiarized text are those where they
take exception to the fact that they've been identified as
witless morons.

I would write more, Visage, but your secretary is none too
happy. This really has nothing at all to do with the fact I
turned loose a mere dozen Black Widow spiders in the office.

She disbelieved me when I told her that they were here as
consultants to create a web home page. As a good and decent
gesture, I suggest we send her to Rockingham to help the
murderous swine film a few Ginsu knife commercials.
