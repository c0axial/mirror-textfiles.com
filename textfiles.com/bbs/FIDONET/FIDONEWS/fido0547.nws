                                     BTBBS?

     I bet your asking yourself, "what is this BTBBS?".  Well I'm glad
     you asked and heres your answer.  BTBBS stands for Borland Turbo
     Bulletin Board System. It is a BBS that is designed by
     programmers and sysops with Borland language products like Turbo
     Pascal/Turbo C.  It is starting up as you read this but we do
     need your help.  If you are a programmer and own a copy of either
     Turbo Pascal 5.0 or Turbo C 2.0 and would like to become part of
     this project then you must either send netmail to me here or have
     your NEC in your area request for the echomail for this project.

     The project will be hosted by 366/200.  The echomail should be
     restricted to only members of the project and sysops of BBS's.
     We will talk about and design a bbs system using lastest
     shareware/freeware plus the great products of Borland
     International.  Two different types of systems will be designed,
     one in Turbo Pascal and the other in Turbo C.  Both systems will
     do about the same as the other but different languages for those
     to pick their favorite language.  Source code of the finished
     product will be available.

     If you are interested in joining the project, contact either me
     at the below address or have your NEC get in touch with me for a
     link to the BTBBS echomail.  Thank you for taking the time to
     read this.

     Hi there! Ever wanted to have something published in FidoNews,
     but were put off by the submission requirements? I know they
     aren't very stringent as to content, but there are a lot of rules
     for the *format* of submissions. They have to have particular
     extensions, there are restrictions on right margins, you can't
     have funny control codes in the file (and how many of us are
     *sure* that our word processors aren't putting in the occasional
     "soft" return?), and you should also follow some "appearance"
     guidelines to make your article look nice (like having most lines
     flushleft, having most lines get near the 65 column mark, having
     a table of contents line at the beginning of the article, etc.).

     It is easy enough to find out what the requirements and
     recommendations are (just F'Req. ARTSPEC), but it is harder to be
     sure you have not made some minor mistake, or missed a
     requirement, or had your word processor "help" you without your
     knowledge. I suspect that many people have been put off sending
     in an article more than once for fear of making a mistake, or not
     wanting to take the time to read ARTSPEC. I know I have been.

     In net 109 we have a newsletter similar to FidoNews. It is called
     KLORE (for reasons which have never become obvious), and it is
     nearly identical to FidoNews in its requirements (mostly because
     it uses a variant of the same software!), and is subject to the
     same "learning curve" for new authors. Events occurred in such a
     way as to make it necessary for me to publish an article in KLORE
     a few months ago, and I had to learn the guidelines and send in a
     submission. It went in just fine, but I spent a few days worrying
     that I had done something wrong, missed a control code, had a
     bare linefeed or something equally disastrous, and that my
     article would be rejected and returned for corrections, or,
     worse, that I would be the cause of the editor having to do extra
     work to fix my blunders.

     Being a programmer, and having a copy of Turbo-Pascal 4.0 that I
     had not used in a while, I decided to write a program to make
     submitting without fear a little easier. NEWS_CHECK is the
     result.

     NEWS_CHECK is intended for use by authors of articles for
     FidoNews, Klore, and any other compatible newsletters, for
     pre-submission verification of format. Once you have your article
     written you just run NEWS_CHECK, give it the name of your file
     and it will check it for fatal errors as well as non-fatal
     "aesthetic" errors such as not being flushleft, having too many
     blank lines at the top of the file, etc. It does not make any
     changes to your submission file; it just lists errors and
     suggestions to your screen. It is possible to redirect the
     messages to a file for reference while editing-in the
     FidoNews 5-47                Page 3                   21 Nov 1988


     corrections. NEWS_CHECK will *not* check spelling or grammar! You
     want miracles you go talk to Borland.

     NEWS_CHECK looks for the following mistakes or ill-advised
     practices:

        1. Incorrect file name extension. Must be ART, SAL, WAN, COL,
        or NOT. Any other extension is flagged as a FATAL error.

        2. Non-Flushleft margin. Based on a percentage of the lines in
        the file, not all of them. (If 50% of the lines in a file are
        not flushleft a WARNING is generated.)

        3. Right margin greater than 65 on any line generates a FATAL
        error. If the line is over 65 characters long, but less than
        70, and all characters after column 65 are spaces, then only a
        WARNING will be generated. This is the only exception to the
        column 65 limit.

        4. "funny characters".  Control chars (except CR-LF pairs)
        result in a FATAL error message. All characters must be in
        the range 20 hex to 7E hex.

        5. If the file is an ad or a notice (SAL, WAN, or NOT) a
        WARNING is generated if the total length of the submission is
        over 30 lines.

        6. Checks for existence of a "contents" line at the top of the
        file. Outputs a WARNING if there isn't one.

        7. Checks for "dashed lines" at the beginning and end of the
        file. Dashed lines  result in WARNING messages.  A "dashed
        line" is any line consisting of at least 4 of only one type of
        character (SPACE excepted). "# # # #" is a "dashed line", for
        example.

        8. Checks for excessive "whitespace" at top and bottom of the
        file. More than 3 blank lines at the front or end of the file
        generates a WARNING message.

        9. Checks for articles that are "too narrow" (have the right
        margin set to too low a value). If over 50% of the lines in a
        submission don't reach at least column 55 a WARNING is
        generated. There are times when narrowness is fine, but most
        articles should have the right margin at 65 for the best
        appearance after publication.


     NEWS_CHECK is designed so that it may be run from a BAT file, and
     returns ERRORLEVEL codes to allow a determination of what
     happened with the check. An example BAT file is included, as are
     several test files that contain errors of various kinds, and a
     (short) documentation file.

     The program is available for file request from 1:109/733, and
     possibly from other places by now, as NEWSCHEK.ARC. If you have
     FidoNews 5-47                Page 4                   21 Nov 1988


     any suggestions for improvement, or reports of problems I would
     appreciate hearing about them, but I can't guarantee that I will
     include all of them (though I will try). If you publish a
     FidoNews-like newsletter, but prefer other parameters for things
     like margins, number of blank lines to allow, length of ads, etc.
     please let me know. It is easy enough to generate a custom
     version with these things changed. The current settings have been
     Okayed by Dale Lovell (FidoNews) and Mike Mahoney (Klore). There
     is no charge for use of this software.

     Steve Bonine

                 An Introduction of Bill Albritten (11/301)


     Bill Albritten was my first experience with a Region Coordinator.
     You know how it goes -- when you first join FidoNet, the Network
     Coordinator is a pretty imposing figure, and if the Network
     Coordinator does his job reasonably well you may not know about
     anyone at a higher level for quite some time.  Finally, after
     quite a while in FidoNet, I realized that there was something
     bigger than a net.  In fact, at that time Region 11 was HUGE --
     it covered much of the central US and a big chunk of Canada.
     Things were calm and quiet, though. . . and that's a reflection
     on Bill Albritten, who is calm and quiet and capable.

     Bill is the director of the Counceling and Testing Center at
     Murray State University in Murray, Kentucky.  Bill holds a Ph.D.
     from the University of Northern Colorado, and has been involved
     in mental health for the past fifteen years.  That is an enviable
     background for dealing with the personalities in the SYSOP
     echomail conference!

     An undergraduate education in math sparked Bill's interest in
     computers and bulletin boards.  Combining two interest areas,
     Bill started a FidoNet BBS in late 1985.  The system had a mental
     health and human services thrust, as well as general support of
     MS-DOS, Apple DOS, Tandy 100, and the C-64.  Bill is the
     coordinator for the CUSSnet echo, but before anyone gets bent out
     of shape about a pornographic echomail conference, it is Computer
     Users in the Social Sciences.  His system currently maintains
     file areas pertaining to AIDS, information for the disabled,
     substance abuse, and other mental health and social service
     concerns.

     In addition to his stint as region-11 coordinator, Bill also
     serves on the IFNA Board as the region 11 representative.  As he
     puts it, "I view BBS's as a way of disseminating information to
     many groups not always well served by traditional media."  He has
     written articles and presented at conferences on the use of BBS
     technology in this regard.

     Bill is married to a professor of social work at Murray State,
     and has a two year old daughter who competes with him for the use
     of the computer.  Bill and his wife share research interests in
     the areas of spouse abuse, courtship violence, and other types of
     family violence.  Maybe that's why Bill is drawn to FidoNet --
     it's just one big happy family.

     Bill usually ends his messages with "Best, Bill."  I'll end this
     by wishing him the same.  Thanks, Bill, for your quiet presence

     and effective help in making FidoNet a better place for all of
     us.

     ROGEL'S CORNER: GETTING INTO HIGH GEAR WITH GPS AND OVERDRIVE
     =============================================================

               AUTOMATIC DOCUMENT ASSEMBLY:  BACKGROUND
               ========================================

     The ability to assemble documents by computer is  to business
     persons and  professionals who  must do a considerable amount
     of writing what spreadsheets  are  to  accountants  and other
     number crunchers.

     Automatic  document  assembly,  at  its  most basic level, is
     creating a document,  whether  it  be  a  simple  "thank you"
     letter  or  a  complex  contract.    Obviously  a  number  of
     documents we create are  repetitive in  nature.   Rather than
     waste time  rewriting the  same old stuff, we looked for ways
     to create a form out of repetitive documents and leave blanks
     for the  information that would change each time we used that
     form.

     Before the computer  became  commonplace,  we  might  run off
     photocopies of our favorite forms and fill in the blanks with
     information from a separate  document or  list containing the
     variable information.   As  our office  equipment became more
     sophisticated, we were able to have  our mag  cards merge our
     variable information  with our  forms.  Of course, this was a
     slow and cumbersome process  and otherwise  suffered from the
     limitations placed upon us by typewriter technology.

     Then the  personal computer  came along  and made  our life a
     whole lot easier and more efficient.   Creation  of the forms
     and  the  variable  information  (and  corrections or changes
     thereto) was a snap.   The  better  word  processing programs
     featured "mail merge", allowing us to quickly produce complex
     documents which appeared to be custom made but  were actually
     the   product   of   merging   our  forms  and  our  variable
     information.

     Computerized  merging  has  been  a  significant productivity
     advance but  it has  not been without its problems.  We don't
     use this otherwise great tool as  often as  we should because
     of the  difficulty both  in learning how to merge by computer
     (i.e., what codes are required to create an  electronic form,
     what  key  combinations  are  required  to produce the merged
     document) and in actually  creating and  using the  forms and
     variable   data   files.      These  difficulties  have  also
     discouraged uniform merge  applications  by  co-workers, with
     the result  being that  offices fail to standardize the forms
     they use.

                    COMPUTERIZED DOCUMENT ASSEMBLY
                    ==============================
     Fortunately, help is on its  way.    In  the  great tradition
     advancing  the  technological  revolution, there are numerous
     public domain and shareware  programs  which  make  the merge
     process  just  a  little  bit easier.  Usually these programs
     FidoNews 5-47                Page 8                   21 Nov 1988


     include a couple of forms (which  you can  alter to  fit your
     needs) and  a data-entry  method (it asks a question, such as
     "Name", and you type in the answer); these programs typically
     insert the  merge codes  into both  the form and the variable
     data you have entered.

          |  GENERAL PRACTICE SYSTEMS VERSIONS 420 AND 500  |
          +=================================================+

     The most sophisticated of  these shareware  document assembly
     programs  which  I  have  had  the  pleasure  of reviewing is
     General  Practice  Systems   (GPS),   a  WordPerfect-oriented
     program  by  Professor  Richard  T.  Rodgers  of Campbell Law
     School.  GPS is available for both WordPerfect 4.2 and 5.0 as
     GPS420.ARC  or  GPS500.ARC,  respectively.    This  excellent
     multiple-document  assembly   program  can   be  obtained  by
     downloading by  registered members  ($25/year; lawyers, only)
     of Professor Rodgers' BBS, Frolic & Detour For  Lawyers [919-
     893-5206].    Anyone  can  obtain  this  program  via mail by
     sending a written request together with $5 per 360k disk + $2
     s/h, to:

          Richard T. Rodgers

          Electronic Law Publishing Co.
          Post Office Box 1119
          Buies Creek, NC  27506-1119


     GPS offers  two sample  forms and a questionnaire which, when
     completed, contains the  appropriate  variable  data  for the
     completion of these forms.  To produce a merged document, you
     simply hit  <alt>-M  from  within  WordPerfect  to  load GPS,
     select the  desired form  from the  GPS menu and then provide
     the file name you just gave the variable-data  file.  Presto,
     instant document.

     GPS is  made up  of WordPerfect macros and merges.  Users who
     are  familiar  with  these  features  of   the  leading  word
     processing  program  can  make  modifications  to  suit their
     needs.

     You may also create  data files  for use  with any  GPS form.
     GPS will  take your  selection of form file and data file and
     merge the two.   This  is  an  extremely  efficient  means of
     automated document  assembly since,  after you spent the time
     initially setting up  your  data  and  form  files,  a merged
     document is  just a  few keystrokes  away.  GPS would be even
     nicer if it included a menu  of your  data files  so that you
     would not  have to  remember the  names of your data files in
     order to take advantage of this powerful feature.

     As long as you use the  GPS forms  and the  questionnaire for
     those  forms,  you  need  not  worry about merge codes, field

     identifiers,  etc.  because  GPS  will  take  care  of  these
     technicalities for you.  But what if you want to use your own
     forms --  a  likely  possibility  since  only  two  forms are
     included --  and, consequently, you also need to use your own
     questionnaire?  Well,  unless  you  are  fairly knowledgeable
     about WordPerfect in general as well as its merge process and
     its macro features, you might have problems.

                      |  OVERDRIVE VERSION 1.1  |
                      +=========================+

     For those of you who  are  not  as  technologically inclined,
     take  a   look  at   OverDrive  Version   1.1  by  TurboSoft.
     OverDrive is  a  sophisticated  and  relatively  easy  to use
     WordPerfect-oriented document assembly program.
     OverDrive comes  with 50 legal forms and over 20 sample forms
     and letters.   When ever  you select  one of  these forms for
     merging,   you   will   be   presented  with  an  appropriate
     questionnaire.   The  forms  and  questionnaires  are already
     merge coded.

     You may add your own forms but this is somewhat complex.  You
     must insert  field identifiers  (i.e., "F1",  "F2"), into the
     form   you   wish   to   add;  then  complete  an  electronic
     questionnaire by telling OverDrive  what type  of information
     FidoNews 5-47                Page 10                  21 Nov 1988


     will  be  substituted  for  the  field identifiers during the
     merge process  (i.e., "addressee's  name"); and  then add the
     name  of  your  newly  added  form  to  OverDrive's  Library,
     described  below.    From  the  information  you  have  given
     OverDrive, it will automatically create a questionnaire, with
     the merge codes inserted.

     There  is  a  context-sensitive  help  screen   available  on
     OverDrive.

     You  can  also  use  OverDrive  to  easily  print  an  office
     documents manual, containing the  Library table  of contents,
     reference  files,  each  document,  and  the Document NotePad
     Window.  This will  provide  users  with  a  simple  means of
     standardizing office forms and training new and old employees
     as to how these forms.

     OverDrive Merge Operation:  Pick, Enter, & Print
     ------------------------------------------------

     To assemble a document,  you  go  through  OverDrive's "Pick,
     Enter, & Print" process.

                               (1)  Pick

     First, you  "pick" or  select a form for your merger from the
     OverDrive Library.  The Library  contains  up  to  5 volumes;
     each volume may contain 5 chapters; and each chapter contains
     a maximum  of 50  documents, for  a total  of 1250 documents.
     Figure  "1"  below  displays  documents  from the "Personnel"
     Chapter of the "Legal" Volume.

     You may  navigate through OverDrive's Library by cursor or by
     using the hot  key  method  (i.e.,  pressing  the highlighted
     letter of your destination area).


     To  assist  you  in  your  selection  of  a form, a "Document
     NotePad Window" is available  at the  press for  each form in
     the Library.   These windows describe the  form to which they
     are attached  and can  be easily  edited to  include notes on
     other forms  that should be considered in combination with or
     in lieu of the form under examination.  You may easily attach
     a Document NotePad Window to forms you add to the Library.

     OverDrive offers  a convenient feature for selecting the same
     combination of forms you use repeatedly.  A  food wholesaler,
     for   example,   may   typically   combine  the  "Independent
     Contractor    Agreement",    "Cover    letter,    Independent
     Contractor",  and  "#10  Business  Envelope,  for Independent
     Contractor"  in   Figure  "1"   above  for   use  with  route
     distributors.  To avoid having to constantly select this same
     combination of forms, he could create a "reference file" with
     the press  of one  key and subsequently "pick" this reference
     file for immediate use of this combination of forms.

                              (2)  Enter

     Once you have completed the "pick" process, you are presented
     with a  questionnaire.   It is at this point that you "enter"
     the variable data.  The questions  you must  answer appear on
     the  left  margin  and  additional information appears at the
     bottom  of   your  screen   with  respect   to  the  question
     highlighted by  your cursor.   You  can easily scroll through
     the  questionnaire  to  change  or  re-examine  any  of  your
     answers.

                             (3)  & Print

     Once you have accepted your answers to the questionnaire, you
     move from the  OverDrive  menu  into  WordPerfect.    At this
     point, you  are instructed  to type <alt>-O.  A new OverDrive
     menu pops up and gives  you  the  opportunity  to  review the
     merged  documents,  edit  the  merged documents, or print the
     merged documents.

     OverDrive Test Drive
     --------------------

     I decided to try a merge with one of the legal forms included
     with OverDrive.  In order to see how easy/intuitive OverDrive
     really is, I only gave the manual a cursory examination.
     FidoNews 5-47                Page 12                  21 Nov 1988


     After typing "OD" I was greeted by the main menu.  One of the
     options was  to "Select  a Document" and as this seemed to be
     the most logical choice, I plunged  ahead.    Then  I  had to
     decide which  "volume" I  wanted (I chose "legal") and, then,
     which "chapter" (I chose  "Wills &  Trusts").   At this point
     the documents  in the selected chapter were displayed; one of
     those  documents  was  a  simple  will.    The  "help" screen
     informed me that I could find out more about this document by
     pressing f10, which I did, and now I knew I that this was the
     form I wanted.  So far, so good.

     At this point it was not apparent what I should do to proceed
     forward with the  merge  process.    Fortunately,  the "help"
     screen informed  me about  my options and I was able to go on
     to the "enter" phase.   The  entry screen  is an attractively
     designed and easy to use questionnaire.

     When I  completed that phase, I opted for the "save" feature,
     per the menu.  Finally  I  found  myself  in  WordPerfect and
     would have  been worried  about what  to do next, were it not
     for the  brief on-screen  message to  type <alt>-O.   At this
     point,  I  was  given  the  option to review the merged will.
     After some minor editing -- which was not  really necessary--
      I had a finished product.

     The  entire  process  of  selecting  the  form,  entering the
     necessary data, and finalizing  the merged  document was easy
     and it took only a few minutes!

     OverDrive Problems
     ------------------
     As  impressed  as  I  am  with  OverDrive,  I  do  have a few
     complaints, as follows:

          1.   Adding forms  to OverDrive  is somewhat cumbersome.
               This is  particularly unfortunate since OverDrive's
               potential is not as  just another  electronic forms
               package --  there are  many of  those and  at a lot
               lower price -- but rather as  a sophisticated means
               of  putting  your  data together with documents you
               frequently use.  This means that for the program to
               really shine,  you will have to add your own forms.
               Some of the problems I experienced  in adding forms
               to the Library are set out below:

               (a)  Identifying   and   designating  the  variable
                    information in  the form:   OverDrive requires
                    you  to  twice  describe  the type of variable
                    information you will use for a particular form
                    (i.e.,  "F1"   is  for   "addressee's  name  &
                    address").

                    You   must   first   describe   your  variable
                    information on paper while inserting code into
                    your form  where  your  data  will  later go--
                    unless you are not concerned whether you might
     FidoNews 5-47                Page 13                  21 Nov 1988


                    forget  what  information  goes   where.  This
                    information   must   be   entered  again  into
                    OverDrive's "New Field Entry Window".

                    A  convenient  alternative  would  be  to have
                    access to  a pop  up "New Field Entry Window",
                    while you are preparing a form to be  added to
                    the Library,  so that  you would  only have to
                    enter this information one time.

               (b)  Naming your newly  added  form:    When naming
                    your newly  created document, you must include
                    the  full   OverDrive   Library   path  (i.e.,
                    volume\chapter\document).   No problem so far.
                    But then to actually  add  your  newly created
                    form to  the OverDrive Library, you must go to
                    the  appropriate  Library  chapter  and  again
                    enter the file name.

               For a  program designed  to save  you the bother of
               entering the same information  more than  once, the
               repetitive   information-entry   requirements   for
               creating new forms is perplexing, at best.

          2.   Storing/using data files:
               My practice requires  that  I  often  use  the same
               data,  such   as  a   client's  name  and  address,
               repeatedly.  Today I may need  that information for
               a letter, tomorrow for a legal document, and so on.

               I need an automatic document assembly  system which
               allows me  to enter  my data one time only and then
               be able to later  merge  that  information  with my
               forms.   Unfortunately OverDrive does not have this
               capability.  It can save the data you  entered when
               merging  with  a  particular  form,  if you wish to
               subsequently  merge  using  that  same  form.   But
               that's it.

               OverDrive's inability to store variable information
               for use with all the  forms  in  its  Library means
               that  I  would  not  find this program useful in my
               professional practice.   On  the  other  hand, this
               limitation  is  insignificant  for those who do not
               need to use  the  same  data  repeatedly. TurboSoft
               also  informs  me  that  they  are  aware  of  this
               limitation and will probably address it  with their
               next release (date unknown).

          3.   The  transition  between  the  "pick", "enter", and
               "print"  phases  is  unpolished:     You   are  not
               automatically  taken  from  the "pick" phase to the
               "enter" phase.  With the use of the help screen and
               some  educated  guessing,  I  was  able to make the
               transition but it should have been either automatic
               or  else   the  commands   should  have  been  more
     FidoNews 5-47                Page 14                  21 Nov 1988


               intuitive.   Indeed,  when  I  chose  one post-pick
               option,  "review",  it  seemed  as  if  nothing had
               happened.  Only later, after taking  a look  at the
               manual, did  I discover  that I  should have exited
               from OverDrive and entered into WordPerfect where I
               could invoke  OverDrive's <alt>-O  macro review the
               document I had just selected.   This seems  to have
               been unnecessarily complicated.

               Similarly,  once  you  have  completed  the "enter"
               phase, you are  dropped  into  WordPerfect, itself.
               The only  clue you  have as  to what  to do next in
               order to print  your  merged  document  is  a brief
               message  on  the  screen  to enter <alt>-O.  If you
               follow  the  message,  you  are  presented  with  a
               relatively  easy-to-follow  print  menu.   I cannot
               imagine why OverDrive forces you to go through this
               follow-the-crumbs  method  rather  than  cause  its
               print menu to automatically  appear upon completion
               of the "enter" phase.

          4.   Limitation on number of reference files and Library
               volumes, chapters, and  forms:    Granted  that 100
               reference  files  as  well  as  Library volumes and
               chapters, with a capacity  for 1,250  forms appears
               to  provide  substantial  capacity.  However, for a
               large  office,  this  limitation   might  adversely
               affect  the  program's utility. OverDrive's network
               version will have a 125,000 form capacity.  Greater
               capacity  should   be  added   to  the  single-user
               version, as well.

          It would be unfair  to OverDrive  to end  this column up
          with a discussion of its shortcomings.  On balance, this
          program offers an excellent productivity tool  for those
          who repeatedly  use the same type of documents and where
          the variable information is not, itself, repetitive.

                      Yet Another Complicated Komment

                            by Steven K. Hoskin
                        ( STEVE HOSKIN at 1:128/31 )

                       Episode 17:  Hard Disk Crashes


     Well, this is nothing new for  those  who've been in the computer
     field as long as (or longer than)  I  have.  But it's educational
     when it happens to you.   I  just  went  down for a week.  Wasn't
     supposed to  be  a  big  deal.    I  took  out  my  old hard disk
     controller and put in a new one.  I own a 20Meg and a 40Meg drive
     but the old controller would only use a 615/4 (20Meg) drive, so a
     friend of mine with the same  disk  set  swapped his 20 for my 40
     while I waited to get a controller.   So I was running fine under
     the old MFM format on 40Meg and biding my time.  A deal came up I
     couldn't refuse on an RLL controller.  Time to upgrade, right?

     For those not familiar with the  hardware terms, MFM (whatever it
     stands for) format is the NORMAL way to use a hard drive.  If you
     have a 10, 20, 40 or 140 Meg hard drive then you probably run MFM
     and don't know it...but you  don't  NEED to know it so who cares?
     If you are running a 30 or 60 Meg drive, you are probably running
     RLL, and might even  realize  it.    RLL  stands  for "Run-Length
     Limited" coding.  What does it mean to the inside of the disk?  I
     have no clue.  It gives you about 26 sectors per track instead of
     the usual 17 on a hard disk and  therefore usually gives you 150%
     the storage in the same amount  of space.  Something is obviously
     getting  packed  in  tighter,   hence  the  higher  standards  on
     certification usually required.    Funny  thing, though, it fools
     your system into - no, not thinking  it has 26 sectors per track,
     but rather that it has more  tracks.   A 'normal' 20 Megger which
     has 615 cylinders and  4  heads  (615/4)  becomes a 1024/4 drive.
     Strange.

     Anyway, neither of the disks were RLL-certified.  So I knew I was
     taking a risk.  Well, the 20 couldn't take it.  It formatted fine
     but within 24 hours of  each  time  it  went operational it would
     start coming up  with  "Sector  Not  Found"s  and  "General Error
     Reading"s.  Even when it was the second drive it ended up causing
     the first one to go bad.  I haven't figured THAT one out yet.

     Things were going badly with the drive and at work and at home so
     I put the computer aside and  worked  in the garage for two days.
     Built shelves  and  whatnot.    Came  back,  took  out the 20 and
     amazingly, EagleTech BBS came back up with 64 Meg of online.

     Anybody got a cheap PC I can throw a spare controller and 20 in?
