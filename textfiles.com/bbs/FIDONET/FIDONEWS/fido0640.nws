     =================================================================

                          ARE THE LEADERS MEMBERS
                  (or putting ya money where ya mouth is)
                          (Bob Moravsik 269/107)

     In SYSOP and FN_SYSOP the question of "where's the IFNA
     membership list has arisen. I know I brought it up.

     Two lists have surfaced:

     1.  The Calloway list, available from Ross Calloway 267/41
         It is dated 6/29/89, contains 162 names, node numbers
         and BBS names. "Cal" list   IFNAMEMB
     2.  The Vietch list, this is the official list of members
         as of 9/21/89.  It contains 132 names, node numbers
         and membership expiration date.   "Vie" list
         Available from Kris Vietch 147/30  IFNAMEMB

     Comparing the two lists yields the following:
       A.  114 people are on both lists
       B.  48 people are on the Cal list but not on the
           Vie list
       C.  17 people all paying dues after 6/30/89 are
           members but not on the Cal list. 1 paid
           dues before the date of the Calloway
           list.


     Since Mr. Vietch is the official in charge of the list the
     Vieitch list is the IFNA list.  The first question that comes to
     mind is which list was used for voting at FIDOCON.  Minutes are
     silent.

     Taking these findings and "overlaying" them on the list of IFNA
     Officers and BOD members yields the following.


              OFFICERS OF THE INTERNATIONAL FIDONET ASSOCIATION

       Thom Henderson 1:107/1015 Chairman of the Board
                                 A member, name on both lists
       Les Kooyman    1:204/501  President
                                 Not a member, name not on the
                                 any list

         Officers

              2 listed as members, 3 non members
              3 on at least one list, 2 not on any list

     Conclusion:
          Well the numbers speak for themselves.  This BOD which
     FidoNews 6-40                Page 3                    2 Oct 1989


          has a majority of non paying members is trying to
          decide the destiny of people who put their money
          where their mouth is and supported IFNA.  Especially
          these 17 whose vote may not have been counted.

     Clarification:  The information in this article was tabulated
                     on 9/24/89. Three days after the date on the
                     official IFNA list from Kris Vietch.
                     To those people who have "checks in the mail"
                     I apologize. To those officers and directors
                     who haven't paid their due.  Well...this was
                     the purpose of this article.  IFNA needs
                     funding.

     Thom Henderson, c/o 1:107/583@FidoNet
     Chairman of the Board, IFNA


                            Directions for IFNA

     I've  finally  managed  to  locate  chairmen  for  all  of  those
     committees.  The  list  still  looks  a little sparse because not
     everyone has given me final confirmation that he'll do it, but at
     least the critical committees are off and running.

     The two most critical are, of course, Nominations & Elections and
     Bylaws & Rules.  Nominations & Elections was the single  hardest,
     because nobody I spoke to wanted to do it.

     First I asked Steve Bonine,  but he turned it down for "political
     reasons" (unspecified).  So then I asked Bob Hartman, but he said
     he  was  too busy,  what with the new baby and all.  Then I asked
     Vince Perriello, but he said he was too busy, period.  Then . . .
     Well, you get the idea.

     Finally I went back to Steve Bonine and told him that he had  the
     worst excuse,  so would he please do it?  Actually I'm condensing
     quite a long phone call here.  I think it was when  I  threatened
     to hold my breath until I turned blue that he realized how much I
     really  wanted  him  to  do  it.  To make a long story short,  he
     agreed.  That means that he's the one who will  be  figuring  out
     how to run the election for the "YPOP resolution".  He assured me
     that  he'll  be  getting  on it quickly,  so you should be seeing
     something soon.

     I also managed to browbeat John Roberts into  handling  Bylaws  &
     Rules,  which is the committee that will be drafting the proposed
     new  IFNA  bylaws  and  the proposed new FidoNet policy document.
     He,  too,  promised to get going quickly,  and I'm sure we'll  be
     seeing  something  from him very soon also.  You should be seeing
     at least a draft Policy  statement  well  before  the  referendum
     deadline.


     So, now that we are starting to go somewhere,  where should we be
     going?  More  specifically,  what  should  IFNA do?  As I see it,
     there are five main functions that IFNA is needed for:

      1) Hold the nodelist copyright and ensure nodelist integrity.

      2) Sponsor FidoNews and hold its copyright.

      3) Sponsor the FidoNet Technical Standards Committee.

      4) Sponsor the annual FidoCon.

     FidoNews 6-40                Page 5                    2 Oct 1989


      5) Provide a democratic voice for FidoNet sysops in matters of
         network management.

     The first four,  at least,  are very passive things.  It  doesn't
     take  a whole lot of sound and fury to hold a copyright -- all it
     takes is legal existance (which people and corporations have, but
     FidoNet does not).  Even the fifth should be mostly  passive,  at
     least as long as everything is okay.

     So on a day-to-day basis,  IFNA shouldn't really be doing much of
     anything.  We don't need it so much to DO things,  as to MAINTAIN
     things,  to  HOLD  things.  By  and large IFNA shouldn't be DOING
     much, except to resolve problems.

     But there are problems.  Three in particular, at the moment.  One
     is  the  lack  of  a  mandate  for  IFNA itself.  That's what the
     referendum is all about,  and Steve Bonine has that well in hand.

     The second problem is that IFNA needs a better set of bylaws than
     it has at the moment,  which is what John Roberts is working  on.
     His  opinion  is that we should get a stock set of 501(c)3 bylaws
     from a lawyer and go from there,  which I think is  an  excellent
     idea.  There are a few things I'd like to see in the IFNA bylaws,
     though:

      1) All FidoNet sysops should be entitled to vote.

      2) There should be no dues, either to vote OR to be in the node
         list.

      3) We need a bit more flexibility in replacing people who aren't
         getting the work done.  This is the bane of all volunteer
         groups, and it's silly not to have some way to deal with it.

      4) We need a greatly simplified election procedure.  You should
         see the hassle that past Nominations & Elections committees
         have had to deal with to tally a Board election.


     The  other  problem  is  the  widespread  lack  of  acceptance of
     Policy4,  which John Roberts is also working on.  When  (and  if)
     IFNA gets its mandate we'll be running another referendum on that
     policy  document so YOU get to decide if you like it or not.

     But what sort of policy should FidoNet have?  I've given  a  fair
     amount  of  thought  to  this  recently,  and  I've  come  to the
     conclusion that presence (or absence)  in  the  FidoNet  nodelist
     should  be  based  on  strictly  technical grounds.  So there are
     sysops who are annoying.  Big deal.  Life  is  full  of  annoying
     people.  Let the other networks be social clubs -- FidoNet should
     be a phone book.

            SeaDog to BinkleyTerm under TBBS 2.x Single Line

                 Brice Fleckenstein, Sysop of 1:231/190

                           27 September 1989

         If you don't run TBBS, feel free to skip this article.

         I've had a few requests for this information, so here's the
     logic behind how I run BinkleyTerm as a CM front end for TBBS
     single-line. I am NOT going to get into the politics of WHY -
     I've been through that mess too many times already.

         If you run TBBS multi-line, you have to run non-continuous,
     just like under SeaDog, due to the nature of multi--line TBBS.
     Or you can wait for the upcomming Mail Option Module like the
     rest of us. This article should still work for you, but I can't
     verify it personally.

         I am going to make a couple of assumptions:

     (1) You have a working TBBS/SeaDog system
     (2) You know how to read the docs to set up each individual
         program mentioned below as required.

     ........... BinkleyTerm - this is your mailer ............

         Set up BinkleyTerm as desrcibed in the BinkleyTerm docs.
     The ONLY critical options under TBBS are that you MUST use the
     BBS Exit option, NOT the Spawn or Batch options.

         If you want to use the Overlay version of BinkleyTerm, you
     can do one of the two following options:

     (1) Copy BT.EXE to MAILER.EXE, and put BOTH in the same
         subdirectory with TBBS.EXE and TBBSDVR.
     (2) Patch the MAILER.EXE text in TBBS.EXE to "    BT.EXE".

         I used option 1 with 2.0s, I am currently using option 2
     with 2.1s as I just haven't gotten around to patching TBBS 2.1s
     (yet).

         You can use the BTBIG version of BinkleyTerm by simply
     Renaming it to MAILER.EXE and placing it in the TBBS.EXE
     subdirectory. BTBIG uses about 25K more RAM or so than the
     overlaid version of Binkley.

     .......... X00.SYS - FOSSIL driver for BinkleyTerm ...........

         I use X00 version 1.08 or so for that very simple reason -
     it works. You may want to use a different FOSSIL if you run a
     HST or a MNP-capable modem - my bare-bones 2400 isn't pickey.
     You can leave X00 on while TBBS and TBBSDVR are loaded - they
     either use it, or ignore it, and I haven't seen anything work
     differently with it installed as far as TBBS is concerned.

     ....... ConfMail - this processes your Incomming mail ........

         I use ConfMail 4.0 because it works, and is a LOT faster
     than any of the ArcMail versions I tried (0.6 through 1.x).
     It's actually VERY simple to set up.

         The critical part for ConfMail with TBBS is to set up only
     ONE Echo entry in ConfMail's AREAS.BBS file, and label it
     PASSTHRU. This echo directory should point to PostMail/PreMail/
     EchoScan's Net Mail directory. As this is where all those
     itty-bitty little *.MSG files go, this directory should
     optimally be placed on a disk drive/partition with a SMALL
     cluster size - I use 1K clusters, for example.

         You can also set up a Bad_Msg directory, if you wish, but
     it should point at a DIFFERENT directory, not the PASSTHRU
     directory.

         I happen to use PAK 2.10 as my de-archival tool - this is
     not a critical decision, your choice may vary.

     .......... OMMM - this processes your Outgoing mail ...........

         OMMM was the first thing I ran into that worked for my
     Binkley\TBBS setup - it's fast enough on the relatively little
     amount of mail I have go out that I never bothered thinking
     about replacing it - though I have upgraded to the newer
     versions, from 1.07 to 1.40.

         It's installation is not critical at all - you tell it to
     take it's input from your Net Mail directory, and put it's
     output in the Binkley specified Hold directory, just like the
     normal OMMM installation says to do.

         I use PKPAK 3.61 with the -otc switch as my archiver - your
     choice of archival tool is up to you, OMMM couldn't care less.

     ..... ParseList - BinkleyTerm and TBBS Nodelist Processing .....

         As space isn't critical on my system, I keep both a full
     Version 6 NodeList for BinkleyTerm, and a NodeList.DOG-style
     TBBS NodeList. I happen to use ParseList to generate both,
     despite the known "offset" bug in ParseList with TBBS. All of
     my derived Nodelist files peacefully coexist in the TBBS
     subdirectory - there is NO overlap in files. You can put the
     Binkley-related nodelist wherever you feel like, as long as you
     tell Binkley where they are, Binkley doesn't care. I'm just too
     lazy to change a basically working system.

         Now that Bob is running TBBS, he has some personal incentive
     to fix ParseList (Bob, are you paying attention? 8-) ).

     ...............................................................

         At this point, you should have a working system. I use some
     other utilities as well, but they're not needed - more like
     extra "flash" - though AMAX has proven VERY usefull.

         To speed processing time up, I do many of the "old" tricks
     - RD then MD my *.MSG directory before each use, automatic
     daily MFSQZ my deleted and/or old mail before running either
     EchoScan or PreMail, use the 2.1 Net Mail /remember option.

         If you want to look at the actual mechanics, or would like
     some examples, I have a file available for FREQ or download
     called ALLBATS - I think it's currently PKPAK .ARC format, but
     it may be PAK format by the time you call. I DO allow users
     download access on the first call, if the FREQ doesn't work -
     the file is in my BBS file section, and I think it's between
     7 and 8 K long.

     Here's some more information on Mike Ratledge's situation, from
     FidoNet Echomail:

     Date:   Sun Sep 24 1989  18:40:00
     From:   Ed Meloan
     To:     All
     Subj:   HUGO and Mike Ratledge
     ------------------------------------------------
     Just got a call from Mike Ratledge. The earlier reports were,
     unfortunately, pretty accurate.  Mike and his wife had gone to
     his father's house and were not injured. Mike's house and =ALL=
     his belongings were not so lucky.  The house was =COMPLETELY=
     destroyed right down to the foundation!  They lost all their
     clothes, furnishings, and computer equipment.

     Mike described finding their refrigerator (which had taken 3 men
     to get into the kitchen) several hundred feet from where the
     house had been! He said that was the heaviest piece of furniture
     they owned and just about all they found. He mentioned that his
     wife was picking up anything personal they could find and putting
     it in a tin can. It's hard to imagine the total devastation that
     they found.

     I mentioned that we were setting up a fund to try and give them
     some financial help and he asked me to express his appreciation
     since they are currently in pretty poor financial condition.  The
     insurance will not cover anything except the structure because
     the damage was NOT caused by wind but was water damage from the
     storm surge.  I told him that I would set up an account tomorrow
     (monday) and we could try to channel something his way in the
     next few days.

     Of course, he lost all his personal computer equipment as well.
     The system that belongs to the company he works for apparently
     came through ok =BUT= they will not have electricity for at least
     10 days to as long as 3 weeks!!  It would appear that Mike will
     not be able to communicate through FidoNet for several days at
     least.  Several folks have sent NetMail to this system and I am
     holding it for Mike until he can pick it up.

     Folks... I know that Mike has many friends across region 18 and
     the rest of the country.  He's helped a lot of folks and now we
     have a chance to show our appreciation.  If you can spare a
     contribution, please send a check to:

            Augusta Forum
            Mike Ratledge Fund
            1110 Terrace Circle Drive
            North Augusta, SC 29841

     Please make the check out to the MIKE RATLEDGE FUND.  I will
     acknowledge ALL contributions in SYSOP18 and will also keep a
     running tally here.  Mike could use the help =NOW=!!

     ------------------------------------------------
     I have just returned from talking to my bank about setting up an
     account to handle donations to Mike Ratledge.  Our bank branch
     manager suggests that we make the checks payable to MIKE
     RATLEDGE.  Then Mike should open an account down in Charleston
     and I will be able to deposit the checks here in North Augusta,
     SC and he can withdraw the funds down there.  None of the banks
     in the

     Charleston area are open yet but they should be back in operation
     by the time your checks begin to reach here.

     I'm anxious to help Mike, as I know of number of YOU are but the
     lack of communications and electricity are making it difficult to
     do much.

     I think our best bet is probably to do as suggested and have you
     make the checks payable to Mike Ratledge rather than the "Mike
     Ratledge Fund".  If you have already sent a check to the Mike
     Ratledge Fund, I don't really think we'll have a problem since we
     are marking them "For Deposit Only".  If you haven't yet written
     one, please just use Mike's name.

     I just spoke to Mike's brother and he asked me to tell everyone
     how much they appreciated our interest and support.

     The mailing address for donations is:

     Subj:   Unofficial Hugo Report...
     ------------------------------------------------
               The Unofficial Hurricane Hugo Report

     Well, folks - to say I'm lucky to be alive would be a gross
     understatement.  I came within 24 hours of the center of Hugo!

     FidoNews 6-40                Page 12                   2 Oct 1989


     Hugo hit dead center and came right through the jetties in
     Charleston harbor.  Most of the whole county, plus a path 50-30
     miles wide between here and Charlotte, NC was decimated.

     Everything is bad - but things north of Charleston are by far the
     worst.  I used to live near a little sleepy fishing/shrimping
     village named "McClellanville" - that town basically no longer
     exists.  Over 90% of the structures within a mile of the ocean
     are just plain gone - period.

     I made a very wise decision at 11PM the night before Hugo hit to
     take my wife, cat and dog to my fathers house - some 50 miles
     south of where I lived.  That decision saved all of our lives -
     no question about it!

     We got up early the next morning (the 'cane blew through about
     11PM to 2AM) before the police and National Guard got their stuff
     together to keep people from getting around - other areas - like
     the beaches are under marshall law even now (and will be for
     weeks - no bridges to get out there).  What we found, after
     climbing over trees stacked 6-8 feet deep for over a mile to get
     in was truly sickening.  My houses (I lived in one, and ran a
     "Bread and Breakfast" type thingy out of the other called
     "Kingfisher Cottage") were hit by a 20 foot storm surge (tidal
     bore) and there is absolutely nothing left - not even the
     foundations of either house.

     We can only even tell where the heck the front house was by the
     concrete slab that was under the garage and kitchen area.  There
     used to be a small subdivision of about 15 big, well-built 1/4M$
     homes on 14' piers about 1/2 mile away - there's nothing left of
     them either - just a few black broken matchsticks where the
     pilings used to be.

     Right now, I'm still in shock I guess.  I'm in a good frame of
     mind - there's not much left to cry about...  The first couple of
     days, I guess we were all running on adrenalin - at this point,
     it's wearing thin and patience is running out.  Frankly, if I see
     another idiot driving up a one-way street the wrong way, gawking
     and saying "gooooolly - thar's another wun" I might just shoot
     the bastards.  It's bad enough without adding to the confusion!

     What we do need down here is clothes - most of the people that
     lived in my area were of small means, and many have absolutely
     nothing left - just like me.  Almost none of them had the Federal
     flood insurance, and if you read the fine print of your
     homeowners policy, you'll find you're not covered for "rising
     tides, floods, crashing waves or tidal waves" or some similar
     wording.  The feds will rebuild your house, but won't replace any
     of your toys - you can't buy flood insurance for the contents
     period.  If you can aid the relief effort by sending clothes,
     please get in touch with your local Red Cross and tell them it's
     for "Hugo relief".

     Fortunately, I did buy it - the bank gave me no choice in making
     the loan.  I will get back about $90,000 for the houses, which I
     have to invest in rebuilding on the property, or the bank will
     keep it to pay off the value of the portion of the loan that no
     longer has any collateral (i.e. the two houses, pumphouse, party
     palace/shed and tobacco barn.)

     Unfortunately, it also means I lost everything but the clothes on
     my back, with no hope for any repayment.  I understand I'm
     eligible for small business loans for both businesses I ran out
     of the houses (the other is my "DESCU" computer consulting gig)
     with no interest, so I can probably swing a decent 'puter
     replacement, and I have several "spare" parts laying around the
     office that will be pressed into service.

     Right now, I am living next door to my office in a company owned
     building we call the "Ruscon Hilton" or "Taj Mahal II".  It's
     really pretty damn nice, four big rooms with fancye carpet and
     builtin mahogony cabinets, etc - in an old Charleston home.
     Since I'm right next door, I've got access to all the computers I
     need for now!

     Also unfortunately, the tape backups I had are destroyed, too -
     they were in the second floor attic of the back house, which was
     built up a little higher than mine.  I don't even have the
     source-code for about 100 programs I've written, although I *do*
     have XRS, QMX and a couple others I was piddling with at the
     office when noone was looking.

     I hiked in again yesterday and carried my computer and 2nd ST4096
     drive out - they were filled with salt-water and plough mud -
     don't really see much hope of recovering anything off them, but
     I'm sure as hell going to give it a good ol' college try!

     Power was restored here at the company downtown yesterday.  It
     comes and goes every once in a while when they kick in another
     transformer, which really makes the computers just happy as h*ll,
     but it's better than 100% darkness which prevailed for four days.
     I now have all three mailer nodes of East Bay X-Change back
     online as of about an hour ago (somebody got a little overzealous
     when I said "disconnect the Ethernet cable in addition to the
     power" <grin>...  Still have about 10 workstations that I haven't
     gotten back onto the network.

     Anyway - it's been one heck of a ride.  I know I've received a
     lot of mail that I cannot take the time right now to personally
     answer each and every one, but I wan't to thank each and every
     one of you that provided help - Ed Meloan is heading up a "Ratman
     relief fund" and right now - it's the only thing carrying me
     through this mess!  Even if I can get a no-interest loan to
     replace the computer, all my other appliances, stereo, clothes
     and what-have-you are AWOL forever.  I'll bounce back, but it's
     going to take time - a *lot* of time!

     If you'd like to help out there, he's taking the checks and
     depositing them directly into my bank account, or you can now get
     them directly to me at my new temporary address:

     151 East Bay
     Charleston, SC 29401

     I don't have a voice number for my the Ruscon Hilton yet - we're
     trying to figure out what the last number on the rotation is so I
     can program the "night ring" over there and only get calls that
     are really for me - right now, I get Ruscon calls at all hours of
     the night, so I've got the volume down to zero.  You *can* reach
     me here at the office - 803/723-9861 during business hours - I'll
     post the real number soon.

     Again - thanks to all of you for the support in my time of need.
     It's rough - but the only way to look from ground zero is up, and
     I've still got a smile on my face.  Don't know if it means I'm
     dumb or insane, but either way, I'll make it!

                      FidoNews: What IS Its Purpose ?
                                Doug Hall
                       Sysop, OnLine New Hampshire
                                1:132/111

     Dear Editor:

     In a few months I will be beginning my 4th year as a sysop of a
     FidoNet node.  My BBS is one of those systems out at the end of
     the branch of the FidoNet tree that reaches in this direction.

     I poll long distance to receive mail every night. Once a week I
     get FidoNews in the mail. I have dutifully unarchived it and
     perused it each time. As yet I haven't found much of use or
     interest to me. Recently there have been a lot of unintelligible
     polemics about network egos and politics.  Useless. There have
     been articles about veterinary medicine.  Useless. There have
     been articles about some sort of computer education awards
     program. Useless. This week an essay on the issue of
     flag-burning. Useless. Now don't get me wrong: I'm not saying
     these communications are useless in content - it's just that our
     network newsletter seems to be the wrong place for them.

     Then there is the list of latest software versions which has been
     getting longer and longer. Unfortunately the list doesn't mention
     what each package does, who might benefit from it, what it
     replaces, or where it can be obtained. Useless.

     There is a weekly list of the same upcoming events. For how many
     weeks do I need to be told that a new area code is forming in
     Illinois or Massachusetts? Useless stuff.

     The last few pages each week are taken up with a lengthy list of
     IFNA volunteers and a form for becoming a member. Useless.

     As I contemplate paying the long distance charges to receive each
     week's issue, I have been asking myself "What is the purpose of
     this newsletter?" Does anyone have an answer to that question?

     A newsletter which is being sent to all sysops should remember
     its audience. Articles should be on topics of interest to that
     audience and should be written to be understandable by the
     audience.

     Rather than just gripe, I'd like to make a few suggestions for
     the editor and the writers of articles for FidoNews.

     EDITORIAL POLICY SUGGESTION #1 -

     As any jounalist will tell you: NEVER USE ABBREVIATIONS OR JARGON
     without explaining them the first time you use them. It took me
     nearly 6 months to figure out what a *C might be (and even now
     I'm not so sure). The backbone? NTSC? OPCNLIST? Each issue
     contains a pack of new abbreviations and terms which the writers
     evidently assume everyone understands. Is this "in group" jargon
     used to put everyone off, to prove that the author is a
     FidoNews 6-40                Page 16                   2 Oct 1989


     super-techie, or what? It would only add a few words to each
     article to make it understandable. Each writer (and the editor)
     needs to ask "How can I write this article so that the new sysop
     that just joined FidoNet yesterday will understand all my terms
     and references?"

     EDITORIAL POLICY SUGGESTION #2 -

     Stop repeating the same information every issue. The calendar of
     events could be trimmed to include only NEW items or only items
     within the next 4 weeks. The IFNA Board and membership stuff
     could be included in the first issue of each quarter. The latest
     software versions could be included in the first issue of each
     month. The masthead could certainly be simplified to a couple of
     lines.

     EDITORIAL POLICY SUGGESTION #3 -

     Articles published should relate to the common network interests
     of sysops. I can receive plenty of other (print) pubications on
     veterinary medicine, Vietnam vets, or computer learning month but
     I have no other source of information on FidoNet as a whole,
     running a FidoNet BBS, etc. Similarly, articles and notices
     related to a singular and specific echomail conference or
     publication (e.g., kidsnews) should be relegated to that
     conference. What would happen if each and every echomail
     conference in the system decided to publish its "news" in
     FidoNews? I would rather receive a SHORT FidoNews than pay long
     distance charges for one stuffed with articles irrelevant to our
     shared context.

     EDITORIAL POLICY SUGGESTION #4 -

     Articles should not be allowed to allude to or hint at
     communications outside of FidoNews itself without adequate
     explanation. If the writer of an article read something in an
     echomail conference, or received a netmail message that is
     important for the other sysops to know about, then it ought to be
     quoted or summarized. Too many articles seem to be based on
     conversations or communications about which the FidoNews reader
     has no knowledge. The main offense seems to be in regard to
     unnamed echomail conferences which some sysop/authors evidently
     frequent and somehow assume that all sysops must therefore
     frequent.

     If there is to be a second channel of shared communication, such
     as an echomail conference, then we ought to be clear about that.
     Maybe we should preface FidoNews with a "Warning:  articles in
     this publication are based on ongoing messaging in XYZ echomail
     conference and assume that the reader has access to and reads all
     such messages."

     FidoNews 6-40                Page 17                   2 Oct 1989


     EDITORIAL POLICY SUGGESTION #5 -

     Don't publish software upgrade information without explanation.
     One of the major shared interests of the net's sysops has got to
     be the software that lets the network exist in the first place.
     If a totally new piece of software is worth listing the author
     ought at the very least to supply an explanation of what is is,
     what it does, what other software it is comparable to or can
     replace, who should consider using it, where it can be obtained,
     etc. If a new version of a previously listed item is released,
     the author ought to provide an explanation of the new features as
     well as summarize the overall purpose it serves.  What are Lynx,
     PRENM, TPBNetEd, TMail, Prune, XRS, ZMailQ, Tally, Mantissa, RMB,
     or Paragon anyway? Does ANYONE know?  They've got to be important
     enough to explain, especially since they are supposed "to verge
     on necessity" even to get listed.

     Thanks for considering these suggestions and comments. I'd be
     interested in your reactions and those of other end-of-the-line
     sysops.

     We're here to tell you about a problem we've been having.

     On a pretty regular  basis,  changes  seem  to  crop  up in other
     mailer  software.  These changes,  which  are  meant  to  improve
     operation of these products, have an affect on the way that these
     other programs communicate with ours.  Often, while accomplishing
     the desired effect when communicating with similar programs,  the
     changes  have  a  negative  effect  on  mail  sessions  with  our
     software.  Far too often (in our opinion), our software is blamed
     for the problems.

     What's  more,  there just aren't any kind of  rigorous  documents
     that  describe  the  integration of these "enhancements" into the
     state tables  which  describe  TSYNC-initiated  sessions.  In the
     absence of this  information,  we have spent a lot of time trying
     to reverse engineer our  code  to  theirs.    The  effect  of the
     aforementioned changes is that we  are constantly implementing to
     a moving target.  What we  wind  up  with is usually close to the
     mark.  Even so, there seem to  be  some phases of the moon during
     which it doesn't work quite right.

     So far, we're only talking  about  a  minor nuisance.  But lately
     some of the problems have reached the level of POLICY complaints.
     This occurred most recently when BinkleyTerm 2.30  was  released.
     A  problem  occurred  with  a  session  which was  using  SEAlink
     Overdrive, in this case with a SEAdog 4.50 system.    The  SEAdog
     user  was plenty irate that he was having this problem,  and  let
     most of the *C structure and FTSC know about it.  Never mind that
     our software is  perfectly  compliant  with  the  base  protocol.
     SEAlink Overdrive, an "enhancement",  wasn't working right.  Mail
     wasn't getting through.  So  a  complaint  was filed against Bob,
     Vince and the FTSC.  It  took  a  long  night  of  work  and some
     careful diplomacy to cool things off.

     This kind of problem  is  why  we need standards in FidoNet.  Why
     Thom Henderson, Tom Jennings, Ben  Baker, Randy Bush, Phil Becker
     and Bob Hartman spent that time  in  the  famous  "New  Hampster"
     meeting.  Why Randy spent all that  time  and  effort documenting
     the results of that meeting (and several previous  meetings) into
     the    definition   of  FidoNet's  base  protocol,  the  FTS-0001
     specification.

     And  this  kind of problem is the reason we have  to  remove  the
     offending code  from  our  software  until  a standard describing
     these "enhancements" accurately  and  in adequate detail has been
     written, tested and approved  by  both  the  original  authors of
     these changes, and by FTSC itself.

     We admit it.  We made a big mistake.   We  tried to support these
     "enhancements"  without having  enough  documentation  to  do  it
     right.  This forced  us  to  reverse  engineer  stuff.  There are
     still problems.  These problems  sometimes  interfere  with  mail
     delivery.  That leaves us with  no choice in the matter.  We have
     to  remove  our  "enhancements"  and  sit back  and  wait  for  a
     reasonable spec.   We can work to the spec when it exists, if our
     marketplace demands it.

     Therefore, our mail products will  be  re-engineered  for  strict
     adherence  to  FTS-0001  and FTS-0006.   "Enhancements"  will  be
     removed in favor of reliable communications using  these standard
     protocol methods.  We also call on FTSC  to  aggressively  pursue
     the  authors of these "enhancements" and get a working  group  on
     the job of documenting them.

     This  might mean that, in the  short  term,  a  few  people  will
     encounter  difficulties  when  communicating  with less compliant
     products, or relying on some "enhancement" which has been removed
     for  the  sake of reliability.  However, in the long  term  we'll
     wind up  with  much  more  compatible,  reliable software.  We're
     honestly sorry for  any  inconvenience  that  this  may cause our
     users.  But we  know that this is the proper decision, based upon
     actual feedback from many of you.

     On October  12, we will be releasing new versions of our software
     with these changes.  We expect that once you can see results from
     the process which we  are  trying to set into motion, you will be
     as enthusiastic about it as we are.

     Thanks for listening.  And  thanks a lot for honoring us by using
     our software.
