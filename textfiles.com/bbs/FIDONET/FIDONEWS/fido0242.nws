                            Why Do We Do This?

       Why run a board?  What do you get out of it?

       I guess every sysop starts out as a user.  After playing  on
       other  peoples'  boards  all hours of the night,  running up
       enourmous phone bills in the process,  one reaches the point
       where the only thing left to do is to be a sysop.

       But, having done it for a month or two, why keep at it?  The
       nature  of  BBS  users  seems to be changing somewhat.  From
       what I gather,  the user who feels that BBSing  is  his  God
       given  right  is becoming something of a minority.  Users in
       general seem to be a much nicer crowd than the often used to
       be.  But still,  what is so great about being a  sysop  that
       anyone keeps doing it?

       Could computers possibly be addicting?

       I  once  thought so;  perhaps I still do.  I remember when I
       was in college I spent more time in the computer  room  than
       in  my own dorm.  Sometimes I'd sit at the terminal (we used
       a mainframe then,  anybody remember them?)  staring  at  the
       screen, trying to think of something interesting to do.

       The  strangest  time  was  about a month before I graduated.
       I'd sit down  at  the  tube  and  get  a  weird  feeling  of
       detachment.  After all,  in a short time I'd be leaving, and
       I'd probably never see that system again.  (I was wrong, but
       that's another story.) What's the point of writing something
       you'll never use?

       I  figured out something to do anyway.  We'd had reputations
       as hackers there,  so we spent the last month  showing  them
       all  the things we could have done,  but hadn't.  But that's
       beside the point.

       Take now for example.  At this moment it is  a  little  past
       two in the morning.  I could be in bed now,  asleep.  Why am
       I at the keys instead?  The best I can come up with is  that
       some people are "into it", and will go to almost any lengths
       to feed their obsession.

       The condition may well be incurable.

                       ON THE INTERESTS OF FIDO:
                         A COLLECTION PROPOSAL
                                TO ALL.
                      By Christopher Baker, Sysop,
                        Metro-Fire Fido, 135/14
                     ==============================


       Kurt Reisler's idea of centralizing the collection of
       information on where various versions of the Fido system
       can be found has spawned an imitator (the SINCEREST form
       of flattery, Kurt) with a similar plan to collect a
       different bunch of information.

       When I show someone the FidoList, their first reaction is
       amazement. The next question they ask is "What do all
       those people do on all those systems?". I give them the
       general low-down on Fido and how the Net operates, but
       they want to know what each node is into, specifically.

       There is a small amount of information to be gained from
       perusing the titles of the nodes but what would the
       uninitiated make of 'YAFIP' (109/610), for example? For
       that matter, what would the seasoned Fidoite make of it?

       With this info as background and for the sake of idle
       curiosity, I propose the following:

                 1. Any and all members of the Network send a
                    FidoMail message to me with a capsule
                    summary of the main thrust of their board
                    and a list of the types of computers they
                    support with files and/or message areas.

                 2. All nodes submitting this info also include
                    any unique or specialty areas of interest
                    they support, i.e., Fire/Rescue, Amateur
                    Radio, Equestrians, Antique Autos, U.F.O.
                    Observations, etc.

       In turn, I will compile all the info that comes in and
       make the resulting file available to FidoNews or other
       Fidos by FidoMail or download.

       So, send those cards and letters folks and let's find
       out what kind of resources we really have in this Network.
       FidoMail your responses to: Metro-Fire Fido, 135/14,
       (305) 596-8611; the more the merrier.

       Thanks in advance for your assistance.

                           HISTORY OF THE WORLD
                         As mistaken by students

       The following article appeared in the USENET jokes group.  I
       hope you enjoy it.


       From: gkloker@utai.UUCP (Geoff Loker)
       Newsgroups: net.jokes
       Subject: History of the World
       Organization: CSRI, University of Toronto

       Thanks to those of you who responded to my request for the
       History of the World as mistaken by students.  Here it is:

            The following was taken  without  permission  from  The
            Wilson  Quarterly,  which  is sort of a Reader's Digest
            for intelligent people.  The article was assembled from
            papers  submitted  by  freshmen  history  students at a
            Canadian university.  The lead-in the  the  article  as
            published  in  The Wilson Quarterly speculated that the
            long-suffering professor who originally assembled  this
            work  did  it  as an act of vengeance.  As you read it,
            consider the possibility that the person or people with
            whom  you share an office may be among the students who
            unknowingly contributed  to  this  article.   All  mis-
            spellings are from the original.





            History, as we know,  is  always  bias,  because  human
       beings  have  to  be  studied  by other human beings, not by
       independent observers of another species.

            During the  Middle  Ages,  everbody  was  middle  aged.
       Church  and state were co-operatic.  Middle Evil society was
       made up of monks, lords and surfs.  It is  unfortunate  that
       we do not have a medivel European laid out on a table before
       us, ready for dissection.  After a revival of infantile com-
       merce  slowly creeped into Europe, merchants appeared.  Some
       were sitters and some were drifters.  They roamed from  town
       to town exposing themselves and organized big fairies in the
       countryside.  Mideval people were  violent.   Murder  during
       this period was nothing.  Everybody killed someone.  England
       fought numerously for land in France and ended up wining and
       losing.   The Crusades were a series of military expaditions
       made by Christians seeking to free the holy land (the  "Home
       Town" of Christ) from the Islams.

            In the 1400 hundreds most Englishmen  were  perpendicu-
       lar.   A  class of yeowls arose.  Finally, Europe caught the
       Black Death.  The bubonic plague is a social disease in that
       it  can  be  transmitted by intercourse and other etceteras.
       It was spread from port to port by inflected rats.   Victims
       of  the  Black  Death grew boobs on their necks.  The plague
       also helped the emergence of the  English  language  as  the

       national language of England, France and Italy.

            The Middle Ages slimpared to  a  halt.   The  renasence
       bolted  in  from  the  blue.   Life  reeked with joy.  Italy
       became robust, and more individuals felt the  value  of  the
       human  being.  Italy, of course, was much closer to the rest
       of the world, thanks to  northern Europe.   Man  was  deter-
       mined  to  civilise  himself and his brothers, even if heads
       had to roll!  It became sheik to be educated.  Art was on  a
       more   associated  level.  Europe  was  full  of  incredable
       churches with great art bulging out  their  doors.   Renais-
       sance merchants were beautiful and almost lifelike.

            The Reformation happened when  German  nobles  resented
       the  idea that tithes were going to Papal France or the Pope
       thus enriching Catholic coiffures.   Traditions  had  become
       oppressive  so  they  too  were crushed in the wake of man's
       quest for ressurection above the  not-just-social  beast  he
       had become.  An angry Martin Luther nailed 95 theocrats to a
       church door.  Theologically, Luthar was  into  reorientation
       mutation.   Calvinism was the most convenient religion since
       the days of the ancients.  Anabaptist services tended to  be
       migratory.   The  Popes,  of  course, were usually Catholic.
       Monks went right on seeing themselves as  worms.   The  last
       Jesuit priest died in the 19th century.

            After the refirmation were wars both foreign and infer-
       nal.   If  the Spanish could gain the Netherlands they would
       have a stronghold throughout northern  Europe,  which  would
       include  their  posetions in Italy, Burgangy, central Europe
       and India thus serrounding  France.   The  German  Emperor's
       lower passage was blocked by the French for years and years.

            Louis XIV became King of the Sun. He  gave  the  people
       food  and  artillery.If he didn't like someone, he sent them
       to the gallows to row for the rest of their  lives.   Vauban
       was  the  royal  minister of flirtation.  In Russia the 17th
       century was known as the time of the bounding of the  serfs.
       Russian  nobles wore clothes only to humour Peter the Great.
       Peter filled his government with accidental people and built
       a  new  capital near the European boarder.  Orthodox priests
       became government antennae.

            The enlightenment was a reasonable time.  Voltare wrote
       a book called Candy that got him into trouble with Frederick
       the Great.  Philosophers were unknown yet, and the fundamen-
       tal  stake was one of religious toleration slightly confused
       with defeatism.  France was in a very serious state.   Taxa-
       tion  was  a  great  drain  on the state budget.  The French
       revolution was accomplished before it happened.  The revolu-
       tion  evolved  through  monarchial,  republican and tolarian
       phases until it catapulted into Napoleon.  Napoleon was  ill
       with bladder problems and was very tense and unrestrained.

            History, a record of things left behind by past genera-
       tions,  started in 1815.  Throughout the comparatively redi-
       cal years  1815-1870  the  western  European  continent  was
       undergoing   a  Rampant  period  of  economic  modification.

       Industrialization was precipitating  in  England.   Problems
       were  so complexicated in Paris, out of a city population of
       one million people, two million  able  bodies  were  on  the
       loose.

            Great Britain, the USA and other European countrys  had
       demicratic  leanings.  The middle class was tired and needed
       a rest.  The old order could see the lid  holding  down  new
       ideas  beginning to shake.  Among the goals of the chartists
       were universal suferage and an anal parliment.   Voting  was
       to be done by ballad.

            A new time zone of national unification roared over the
       horizon.   Founder  of the new Italy was Cavour, an intelli-
       gent Sardine  from  the  north.   Nationalism  aided  Itally
       because  nationalisn  is  the growth of an army.  We can see
       that nationalism succeeded for Itally  because  of  France's
       big  army.   Napoleon III-IV mounted the French thrown.  One
       thinks of Napoleon III as a live extension of the late,  but
       great,  Napoleon.  Here too was the new Germany: loud, bold,
       vulgar and full of reality.

            Culture fomented from Europe's tip to its top.  Richard
       Strauss,  who  was violent but methodical like his wife made
       him, plunged into vicious and  perverse  plays.   Dramatized
       were  adventures  in  seduction  and abortion.  Music reeked
       with reality.  Wagner was master of music,  and  people  did
       not forget his contribution.  When he died, they labeled his
       seat "historical".  Other countries had their  own  artists.
       France had Chekhov.

            World War I broke out around 1912-1914.  Germany was on
       one side of France and Russia was on the other.  At war peo-
       ple get killed and then they aren't  people  any  more,  but
       friends.    Peace  was  proclaimed  at  Versigh,  which  was
       attended  by  George  Loid,  Primal  Minister  of   England.
       President  Wilson  arrived  with  14 pointers. In 1937 Lenin
       revolted Russia.  Communism raged among  the  peasants,  and
       the civil war "team colours" were red and white.

            Germany was displaced after WWI.   This  gave  rise  to
       Hitler.   Germany  was  morbidly overexcited and unbalanced.
       Berlin became the decadent capital where all forms of sexual
       deprivations  were practised.  A huge anti-semantic movement
       arose.  Attractive slogans like "death  to  all  Jews"  were
       used by governmental groups.  Hitler remilitarized the Rine-
       land over a  squirmish  between  Germany  and  France.   The
       appeasers  were  blinded  by  the  great red of the Soviets.
       Moosealini rested his foundations on eight million  bayonets
       and  invaded  Hi Lee Salasy.  Germany invaded Poland, France
       invaded  Belgium,  and  Russia   invaded   everybody.    War
       screeched to an end when a nukuleer explosion was dropped on
       Heroshima.  A whole generation had  been  wipe  out  in  two
       world  wars,  and the forlorne families were left to pick up
       the peaces.

            According to Fromm, individuation began historically in
       medieval  times.   This  was  a  period  of small childhood.

       Thanksgiving is now over it seems, and those of us who pro-
       ided you with free Thanksgiving Fidograms want you to know
       a thing or  three.

       First off, the Amateur Radio networks would have been busy
       enough this week, thank you, sending "Happy Turkey Day"
       messages and the like to thousands of people around the
       country.  That was even before Fido began wagging his tail
       into the picture!

       Now that more and more users of Fidonet are becoming aware
       of the link with Amateur Radio that allows them virtually
       unlimited free telegrams, we expect the radio end of things
       to bulge a bit at the seams.  After all, Fido users are a
       discerning lot, no?  And I suspect they're mostly like me -
       (cheap/chintzy/tight!); able to spot a freebie when they
       glimpse one.

       The point we're getting at (ever so slowly) is that you
       shouldn't wait a day longer.  Dig out your little black
       books and send your Xmas Fidograms today.  Now - before you
       forget.  Waiting any longer will only put that much more of
       a strain on our system for the holiday crunch!

       Secondly, try to keep in mind what the text of your Fido-
       grams will sound like when they're delivered to the
       recipient.  Lines of basic programming, and cute little
       jingles like "Roses are red, violets are blue, today's the
       day for turkeys like you" lose much of their value (?) when
       delivered by a total stranger over the phone.

       Finally - in years past we've had the miserable experience
       of being asked on December 24th to deliver large volumes
       of message traffic in time for Christmas.  Ditto for sweet
       nothings during the evening of February 13th.  Do all of us
       a favor - be thinking of who you want Christmas Fidograms
       to go to - during November.  For Valentine's day, birthdays
       and other important dates, plan early.  We'll gladly accept
       them here at 101/105 many weeks in advance, and will relay
       them to the city of destination to be held until the date
       you specify.

       Granted, the tone of this week's Fidogram article has been
       a bit negative.  It's just that while we feel comfortable
       knowing that the majority of your free Fidograms are being
       delivered promptly and usually within the time frame that
       you expected, there are always a few who fail to understand
       the "labor intensiveness" of our networks. Help us to help
       you with your holiday Fidograms - send 'em early!

       There's more than a Token-Ring LAN in IBM's latest announcements

       by Robert E. Spivack
       Spiv's Fido Net #143 Node #3
       (408) 972-8164

       A few weeks ago IBM  formally  announced  their  worst  kept
       secret,    the    IBM   Token-Ring   Local   Area   Network.
       (Coincidentally,  Intel also announced their own worst  kept
       secret, the 80386 microprocessor chip.) By most accounts, it
       was  a  simple,  one-product  announcement  legitimizing the
       rumors that have persisted in the industry for the past  few
       years.

       In reality,  IBM announced a multitude of new products, some
       of them complementary to  the  Token-Ring  LAN,  and  others
       entirely  unrelated.  Careful  perusal  of  the official IBM
       literature (unofficially called  "ivories"  because  of  the
       pure  white paper used) reveals several exciting products in
       new areas for IBM.

       First of all, some clarification.  The actual Token-Ring LAN
       consists of four new products: the IBM Token-Ring Network PC
       Adapter  (part  #6339100),   the  IBM   Token-Ring   Network
       Multistation Access Unit (part #6091014), the IBM Token-Ring
       Network  NETBIOS  Program (part #6467037),  and the Advanced
       Program-to-Program  Communication  Software  APPC/PC   (part
       #6467038).

       As you might have guessed, the Token-Ring Network PC Adapter
       is  the  actual,  full size board that plugs into the IBM PC
       and provides the hardware for the  network.  The  Token-Ring
       Network Multistation Access Unit is a rack-mountable cabinet
       that  links  up  to 8 PC's and itself can be linked to other
       MAU units.

       Physically,  PC's on the IBM network are wired  together  in
       groups to a centralized wiring box, the above mentioned MAU.
       (In  network  lingo,  the  IBM  network  is  a physical star
       topology; the IBM network "ring" is a logical construct, one
       that exists in the software that drives  the  network.)  The
       actual cost of linking each PC into the network is therefore
       the  cost of the individual Token-Ring Adapter board and 1/8
       of the cost of the required MAU.

       The rationale for this setup is that it is very reliable and
       easy to install.  The MAU is an active  device  (powered  by
       electricity)  and  is  smart enough to disconnect any one of
       the individual PC's linked to it if they are malfunctioning.
       Thus, in a large network,  any PC can be turned off or break
       and not cause the entire network to stop working.

       This  is quite different from Ethernet (for example) where a
       problem in one PC can sometimes crash  the  entire  network.
       In  fact,  the  IBM  scheme  is  very  similar  to  business
       telephones.  If you look at the wiring in any office complex
       you will find that groups of  telephones  have  their  wires
       drawn  to  a central wiring box which is usually hidden in a


       Fidonews                   Page 10                2 Dec 1985





       closet.

       In a surprise addition  to  the  product  announcement,  IBM
       stated  that  as  an alternative to expensive coaxial cable,
       the Token-Ring LAN can also utilize normal telephone wiring.
       Further,  IBM stated that in many  cases  existing,  already
       installed telephone wire can be used for the network.  Thus,
       installing  an  IBM  Token-Ring  Network might be as easy as
       putting a MAU in a telephone cabinet and connecting  up  the
       wires that already exist, but are unused.

       IBM  also  announced  that  it  will offer a service program
       where IBM will inspect/test already existing telephone  wire
       and  certify  whether  it  can be used with the IBM network.
       When one begins to realize that the cost of  installing  the
       network  cables  is  often  the only real cost of networking
       (labor and materials for coaxial  cables  adds  up  quickly)
       this  shows  clearly  that  IBM understands why everyone has
       been slow to accept networking until now.

       The Token-Ring Network NETBIOS Program,  although a separate
       software  product,  is an intrinsic part of the new network.
       When  IBM  introduced  its  first  network,   the  IBM/Sytek
       broadband   "PC   Network"   it   created   a   well-defined
       hardware/software interface called the NETBIOS (for  NETwork
       Basic Input Output System).

       The   NETBIOS  provides  a  way  for  third  party  software
       developers to write programs and be  guaranteed  that  their
       programs  will  continue  to  run  on new IBM hardware.  The
       NETBIOS is very similar in concept to the  original  IBM  PC
       BIOS  which provided a standard interface for direct control
       of the hardware in the IBM PC.

       The release of the NETBIOS software is  very  important  for
       two  reasons.  First of all,  it demonstrates that IBM truly
       is committed to an  open  network  interface.  All  software
       developed  for  the  IBM/Sytek PC Network that uses only the
       NETBIOS interface will execute properly on  the  new  Token-
       Ring LAN through the NETBIOS.

       Secondly,   the  NETBIOS  is  software,  not  firmware.   By
       providing the NETBIOS as a separate program on diskette, IBM
       is free to enhance its  internal  workings,  add  functions,
       improve  its  performance,  etc.  and can simply issue a new
       diskette with the changes.  By comparison,  the IBM/Sytek PC
       Network  includes  the  NETBIOS  software  as part of a PROM
       (programmable  read-only  memory)  on  the  network  adapter
       board.  Changing PROM chips, although feasible, is much more
       difficult and expensive.

       Additionally,  the  release  of  NETBIOS  software  from IBM
       validates what AST Research has already done.  For the  past
       several months, AST Research, a leader in multifunction add-
       ons  for  the  IBM  PC,  has  been marketing its own NETBIOS
       software for OEM's.  IBM's continuing  use  of  the  NETBIOS
       approach  should  bring  a wave of customers to AST Research
       wishing to develop their own networking  products  that  are


       Fidonews                   Page 11                2 Dec 1985





       NETBIOS compatible without having to spend the time to write
       a  NETBIOS themselves.  (Gee Tom,  will Phoenix Software let
       AST Research gain a foothold here?)

       The final part  of  the  Token-Ring  announcement,  Advanced
       Program-to-Program Communication Software (APPC/PC), is only
       partially  related  to  the  network products.  APPC/PC is a
       major part of IBM's  communications  software  and  is  more
       commonly  known  as  LU 6.2.  By bringing LU 6.2 software to
       the IBM PC,  IBM is providing the foundation for third party
       developers   to   finally  provide  true  micro-to-mainframe
       software solutions.

       APPC/PC includes a clearly defined API (application  program
       interface).  If  third party software developers use the API
       then IBM or other companies are free to improve the hardware
       used  for  networking   or   data   communications   without
       applications software having to adjust.

       Until  now,   micro-to-mainframe  solutions  for  PC's  have
       focused on solving  the  hardware  problems  of  linking  to
       mainframes.  Products such as DCA's IRMA, or CXI's PCOX do a
       good  job  of bridging the hardware differences but provided
       only  rudimentary  services  beyond  strick  3278   terminal
       emulation.

       APPC/PC  with LU 6.2 capability sets the stage for much more
       sophisticated applications.  Imagine a database program such
       as dBASE-III or R:Base that, transparently to the user,  can
       automatically  query  information on the corporate mainframe
       as easily as on the PC that it is running on!

        * To NEC or not to NEC

                   INTEL 8088 verses the NEC V20

         Is the NEC V20 better than Intel's 8088 and do we care?

           Yes I know, that seems to be all we see in Fidonews
       these days, but that's the reason for one more article. We
       all have heard how great the NEC V20 is and how Intel is
       suing NEC for copying the 8088. But if the NEC chip wasn't
       better I'm sure Intel wouldn't be suing, but if the NEC chip
       is better then how can Intel claim that it is copy?

           While trying to come up with something interesting I
       decided to run CPUID.COM (a cpu identifier program). CPUID
       told me that my Intel 8088 was a version 1.38 8088. It also
       told me that my 80286 cpu was a ver 1.38 80286. Now the
       interesting part came when it told me that the NEC V20 was
       a ver 1.38 8088.

           But to the reason I'm writing this. Many people have run
       comparisons and come up with many different results so I
       decided to confuse the issue even more.

           I decided to time both Intel's 8088 ver 1.38 and the NEC
       V20 at both 4.77 Mhz and 8 MHz in a Sperry PC with 640 K and
       Tulin TL240 hard disk with an 80 millisecond access time. To
       be able to test both the computing time and the ability to
       handle IO operations I decided to archive PCBOARD with
       LU.EXE thrown in by mistake, using ARC44.EXE. I felt that
       this would force the CPU to do as many different operations
       as possible and still keep the test simple. PCBOARD consist
       of 414227 K of 83 separate files. ARC44 libraries and
       compresses files the most efficient way, some are squeezed,
       some are compressed, crushed, ect. The Archived file was
       260786 K, a savings of 153441 K  of disk space. (A small
       pitch for ARC).

          I also decided to do the same test on a Sperry IT with a
       80286 CPU to compare clock rates. The Sperry can be run at 6
       Mhz 1 wait state (the standard IBM AT rate), 7.16 Mhz, 0
       wait state, and 8 Mhz, 1 wait state. Interestingly enough,
       the wait states affect the processing time more then the
       clock rate. For those that wish to compare the IT time to
       the standard Sperry, it must be noted  that the IT's hard
       disk has a 30 millisecond access time. I don't believe
       a truly accurate comparison can be made, and I didn't do it
       by floppy because of the file size (I did that on purpose).

          As you will see, there was only an effective nine percent
        increase of power, although  when CPU.COM was run it said
        the NEC V20 was running at a lightning 19.47 Mhz.

          Even if the performance of the NEC V20 CPU doesn't
       warrant upgrading your 8088, there is one last tidbit to
       throw out. Digital Research has released under I believe the
       Shareware concept a program called V20-80.COM, which allows
       you to run CPM 80 on your IBM/Compatable PC, and Intel still


       Fidonews                   Page 13                2 Dec 1985





       thinks both CPU's are the same?  To think you can have all
       this for less then a box of diskettes or more precisely
       $20.00.


              The following are the results I obtained.

       MACHINE, CPU,                    ARCHIVE TIME    % INCREASE

       Allen Miller, 108/10

                        FASTBACK Backup Software

            FASTBACK is a $179 copy-protected program from Fifth
       Generation Systems that provides an alternative to the DOS
       BACKUP/RESTORE utilities.  It greatly reduces the time to
       backup a hard disk and gives greater functionality to the
       restore operation.  Since it greatly reduces the amount of
       time required to backup a hard disk, it may also increase
       the likelyhood that users will backup their data.

            FASTBACK can be run with command line parameters
       supplied, similar to the way one would execute DOS BACKUP.
       In addition, it will provide full English prompts for
       parameters if no command line parameter is supplied or the
       parameters can be stored in a DOS text file for repeated
       use. FASTBACK uses its own diskette format and will format
       backup diskettes on the fly as it does its backup 'run'.  If
       you have a personal computer with two similar diskette
       drives, it will alternate between the two drives so you can
       change one diskette while it writes the other diskette.
       Interestingly, FASTBACK keeps the floppy disk drive spinning
       continuously during its backup run thus eliminating the time
       required to get the drive up to speed after each diskette is
       inserted.

            FASTBACK will create a 'catalogue' file on your hard
       disk of all the files that have been backed up and update it
       as successive partial backups are performed.  This enables
       it to GREATLY improve on the restore type operation.
       Without inserting any of your backup diskettes, it is able
       to present you with a directory of all the backed up files
       with full scrolling and searching capabilities.  You can
       selectively restore a file and FASTBACK will know exactly
       which diskette to prompt you for.

            Now for the neat part.  The first time you use FASTBACK
       and write to your diskettes the execution time is longer
       than successive runs when FASTBACK does not have to also
       format the diskettes.  FASTBACK requires about the same
       number of diskettes to backup a given amount of data as
       would DOS BACKUP, however it is FAST.  I backed up an XT at
       a rate of 1.2 mb/min.  On my AT, I was able to backup my
       entire hard disk (which contained 17.9 meg of data) in 9
       minutes and 24 seconds or 1.9 mb/min.  Imagine - NINE
       MINUTES FOR 18 MEG.

              (408) 972-8164

       I have recently re-arranged my system(s) and have the
       following hardware for sale:

       BABY BLUE:
       This is a CP/M-80 emulation board for the IBM PC and
       compatibles.  Great for maintaining the ability to run CP/M-
       80 programs while getting rid of an old CP/M system.

       TECMAR MULTIFUNCTION BOARD:
       I forgot the exact name but this is the one with 384 KB of
       memory, battery backed-up clock, one RS-232 serial port and
       one Centronics parallel port.  Includes full instruction
       manual and a diskette full of Tecmar utility software.

       3COM ETHERNET CONTROLLER BOARD:
       This is a complete Ethernet local area network controller
       board.  I'm sorry, but I don't have a copy of the manual.
       This board is great for someone already running 3Com
       Etherseries network or Novell Netware/3Com.  You'll have to
       know what you're doing and already be a network user, but
       I'll give you a great deal!

       NESTAR NETWORK INTERFACE CONTROLLER ("NICS"):
       I've got a few of these boards that I picked up at a local
       computer swap meet.  If you are running any kind of NESTAR
       local area network (PLAN 2000, PLAN 3000, or PLAN 4000)
       you'll find these handy.  It's a great way to expand your
       network at a low cost.  Same scenario as above, no manual,
       no documentation, not for the novice, but a great
       opportunity for someone already using NESTAR's token bus
       network setup.

       IBM TOPVIEW SOFTWARE:
       If you want to play around with multi-tasking, I've got a
       brand new, shrink-wrapped copy of IBM's Topview.  It may not
       be perfect, but it beats waiting for Pc-DOS 4.0 or 5.0 to
       come out.

       IBM DATA EDITION:
       I've also got a copy of this one.  It is IBM's file-oriented
       database manager designed to be part of the "IBM Personal
       Decision Series" but is also a complete standalone system.
       I'm just an addicted dBASE-III fan, but some of you might
       find a home for this well-documented file management system.

       OLDIE BUT GOODIE SOFTWARE:
       Here's a few items I have collected and are now sitting on
       my shelf taking up precious space.  (All include the
       original master disks, full documentation, and an "as is"
       warrantee.)

       VERSAFORM -- The forms oriented database package
       DATAFAX -- A Freeform, text search database system
       VISISCHEDULE -- Remember the guys who wrote Visicalc?  This
       is the PC version of their acclaimed project s/w


       WHY THERE ARE NO PRICES LISTED FOR ANY OF THIS STUFF:
       I am a horsetrader and I know the fair market value (or
       retail price) of these items.  I bet some of you do too!  So
       if you're willing to take a chance and make and offer, I'll
       consider it.

       The first offer that meets my own desired selling price will
       be accepted.  So, the risk for offering a very low price is
       NOT being able to buy it, and the risk for offering a very
       high price is guaranteeing the purchase but perhaps paying a
       little more than you had to.

       As they say, "nothing ventured, nothing gained".  Why not
       take a risk and FidoNet me a message with an offer on any of
       these exciting items?

       (You can also call my Fido directly, but please bear in mind
       it is a semi-private system:  Simply leave your message as a
       private one to the Sysop.)

            SPECIAL NOTICE for DEC FIDO USERS AND SYSOPs

       The DECUS PC SIG in cooperation with a number of the Rainbow
       FIDO SYSOP's are planning to run a Fido at the national DECUS
       Meeting to be held the week of December 7th, 1985 in Anaheim,
       California. The node number is listed as private in the
       current nodelist.333 as Fido 102/555 DECUS_Anaheim. The SYSOP
       recruited for the week is Fritz Howard who runs the Hitch
       Hikers Guide at 102/23. The board will be using a Rainbow
       100+ donated by DEC.

       If you are running a DEC Rainbow Fido or have DEC users on
       your board we ask that you permit them to send FidoNet Mail
       to 102/555. The can be done by giving those users credit or
       setting the message cost for 102/555 to $0.00. This is a
       great opportunity for your DEC users to find out what's
       going on at DECUS or perhaps ask questions to some of the
       DEC experts that will be attending.

       We ask that you place a notice in your bulletin to let your
       users know about DECUS_Anaheim and remind them that this
       board will only be running Mail for one week during DECUS.

       If you are planning to attend DECUS and would like to help
       out please send a message to Fritz Howard at 102/23.
