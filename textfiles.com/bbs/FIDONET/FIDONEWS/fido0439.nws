                       FidoNews Generator is Offline


     The  system  that  creates  FidoNews  every  week  has suffered a
     hardware attack.  We are engaged in major surgery to  revive  it,
     but the prognosis is not good.

     In  other words,  my system died and I have been unable to get it
     up and running reliably.  Plans made long ago call for  my  being
     away  for  the next two weeks,  and I have no time left to get it
     fixed before I leave.  This unfortunate timing of events means:

      1) It will be AT LEAST three weeks  before I can publish another
         issue of FidoNews.

      2) The  files  mentioned  in  last  week's  FidoNews  as   being
         requestable  from  107/6  or  downloadable  from our BBS will
         probably not be available for at least another two weeks.

      3) Nodes in Region 13 may  experience  difficulties  in  getting
         their  node  list updates in,  or in receiving new node lists
         over the next two or three weeks.

     I will endeavor to get the problems fixed  as  soon  as  possible
     upon my return.  Until then, you have my apologies in advance for
     whatever inconveniences may occur.

     Substitute Editor's note:  Rather than publish absolutely nothing
     for a 3-week period,  Thom has arranged for one of his underlings
     to pinch-hit with this abbreviated edition.

     However,  we don't know yet what we'll do next week.  Maybe it'll
     be "The Best of FIDONEWS."

                             COMMITTEE REPORTS
     =================================================================


     Don Daniels, President
     International FidoNet Association
     FidoNet 1:107/210


                     IFNA Status Report for October 1987


     This is the first of what should be a  monthly status report from
     me to  the membership  of  IFNA.   It is my intention  to publish
     these reports here in FidoNews the  first week of each month from
     now until  the end of  my term in August.   My apologies for this
     report being a week late - this was due to technical difficulties
     experienced with both my machine and the one supporting FidoNews.

     I have requested that  all of the Committee  Chairmen  provide me
     with Status Reports outlining their Progress  for the past month,
     current Problems, and Prognosis for the coming month.   My status
     report to you, which will take the  same general format,  will be
     based on  their  reporting and on  additional  material  from the
     various officers of the Association.


     PROGRESS DURING THIS PERIOD

     General
       Well, we're underway!   We may not have a full head of steam up
       yet, but at least we seem to be moving a bit  -  and much of it
       is in the same general direction for a change!

     Administration and Finance
       We still do not have an official Chairperson for this committee
       so Ken Kaplan continues  as Acting Chairman.   He and Treasurer
       Leonard Mednick  have been in contact and intend to meet in St.
       Louis in order to perform a turnover of responsibilities.

     Board of Directors
       The BoD has formed its own echo and has  discussed a variety of
       concerns.   To date, however,  progress on any one  these items
       has  been stymied by a  lack of structure.   One question  that
       appears to  have been resolved is the question of whether a new
       node in South Africa  should be allowed  to join FidoNet.   The
       consensus  appears to be that,  as FidoNet is  dedicated to the
       free and open exchange of information,  it may prove beneficial
       (even  in some small way)  to admit any node  that  ascribes to
       those precepts.

     By-laws and Rules
       The primary  activity of  this commmittee  this month  has just
       been the manning of the committee.

     Executive Committee
       This committee has formed its own Echo and has begun discussion
       on a variety of topics.   No specific decisions  have been made
       to this point, however.

     International Affairs
       This committee  has not "met" as of yet,  although  Henk Wevers
       has provided some assistance to Switzerland which has scheduled
       its first National Sysop Meeting for the first weekend in
       October.

     Membership Services
       Phil Ardussi sent in a very nice report  which I've summarized.
       Committee   organization  included  the  formation   of several
       sub-committees: FidoCon Site Selection (Jim Cannell),  Echolist
       (Gene Coppola), Help Node (David Dodell), New Sysop Help (David
       Bonine),  and  Membership  List  (Norm Henke).    Several other
       projects are under way including requests for proposals for the
       site of the next FidoNet Conference.

     Nominations and Elections
       Dave Dodell informs me  that he has  formed his commmittee  but
       they have tabled any action at this time  as it is too early to
       gear up for the next elections.

     Publications
       No detailed report has been received from this committee.

     Technical Standards
       Ryugen Fisher says that the  following sub-committees have been
       formed (or established liaison) and been manned: New Protocols,
       Documentation, Beta Testing, 9600 Modems, FOSSIL.

     PRESENT PROBLEMS

     General
       The main problems  with which  we are presently faced appear to
       be of the start-up variety.  For most of us (Techies primarily)
       running  an  organization  is  something  that  does  not  come
       naturally  -  particulary  when you consider  that  most of our
       interaction must be performed via electronic mail.

       To give you just one  example of the effect of geography on our
       endeavors,  consider  the  case of the  eight-member  Executive
       Committee: one each from New Hampshire,  New York,  New Jersey,
       Virginia, Illinois, Oklahoma, California, and Washington.   And
       this group is suppossed to  "meet at least quarterly" according
       to the By-laws.

       "So `meet' electronically!"  you reply.   Well, it appears that
       its not so simple.   Having checked  with our  lawyers, we find
       that there does  not appear to be any state which will  legally
       allow for official business  to be conducted  via an electronic
       medium.   It seems that we're victims of being more progressive
       than the legislative process.   What we are attempting to do to
       resolve this dilemma  is to go ahead  and conduct our  business
       via electronic mail, but augment our actions either with USMail
       signature  cards  or by  meeting at  various  times  where,  in
       person, we can "ratify" the decisions we've made previously.

     Administration and Finance
       One problem Ken reports is that, with the official IFNA address
       and phone number existing in St. Louis, he is still overwhelmed
       at times  with new business.   Changing the  address every year
       with a new administration, however, does not make sense.

     Board of Directors
       The large size of  this group  and its  geographical  disparity
       makes it very difficult for business to be  effectively handled
       in the BoD EchoCon.   Another concern is the resignation of Ben
       Baker as Vice President - Technical Coordinator.

     By-laws and Rules
       Steve indicates that without specific direction from either the
       BoD or Executive Committee, it is difficult for them to proceed
       on fixing some of our organizational problems.

     Executive Committee
       The fact that  there is so much to be done by a  few disjointed
       volunteers has really been brought home in this, the front-line
       committee.  Additional mechanisms are required to structure the
       work in ways that will allow it to be efficiently handled.

     International Affairs
       It goes without saying  that distance here  has a  considerably
       detrimental effect on progress.   We need to establish a really
       effective way of maintaining a responsive  EchoCon  before much
       business can be done by this committee as a whole.

     FidoNews 4-39                Page 7                   12 Oct 1987


     Membership Services
       Some of the volunteers have not been contacted yet.   They will
       be as the sub-committee work get underway.  Phil wonders how to
       get the committee  members together in order to  "get done in a
       couple of hours what it takes in two months of EchoMail."

     Nominations and Elections
       The only problem  that has cropped up so far is the question of
       a conflict of interest in the case of members of this committee
       who wish to seek office in the next election.  Tom Marshall has
       been asked to comment on this.

     Publications
       Brian Hughes  has indicated  to me that he  may be transferred.
       Such concerns  have resulted  in essentially no time  left over
       for this committee.   Brian, although he does not wish to leave
       the committee, may be forced to drop the chaimanship.

     Technical Standards
       There have been a few problems with various assignments of some
       individuals to the sub-committees as some people either did not
       feel  qualified or  lacked required  background or skills for a
       particular  group.   It is hoped that  most of this has been or
       will be resolved.


     PROGNOSIS FOR THE COMING MONTH

     General
       It is hoped that the use of Richard's Rules of Electronic Order
       may provide the  infra-structure that  will help several of the
       committees become more efficient through ECHOMAIL.   Hopefully,
       our present wheel-spinning trying to get underway will decrease
       and we'll see more things getting done next month.

     Administration and Finance
       Leonard is planning to make a stop in St. Louis this month to
       take over much of what Ken does in this area.

     Board of Directors
       If  Richard's Rules of Electronic Order  appear to work  in the
       Executive Committee,  they will be applied to this committee as
       well.

     By-laws and Rules
       Activity in this  committee will mostly be tabled until we have
       a chance to see what works and what doesn't.

     Executive Committee
       It is expected that this committee  will be the guinea pigs for
       Richard's Rules of Electronic Order.   This, or some other form
       of structure, is the primary requirement to resolve so that the
       rest of the work can be more effectively attacked.

     International Affairs
       No specific plans have been made for this coming month.

     Membership Services

       In addition to ongoing sub-committee work, it is  expected that
       all proposals for the 1988 FidoNet conference  will be received
       during this month.

     Nominations and Elections
       No activities are planned for the coming month.

     Publications
       Brian Hughes is to resolve the chairmanship problem this month.

     Technical Standards
       It is expected that this month will primarily  be involved with
       the  internal  organization and  operation of the  various sub-
       committees.
