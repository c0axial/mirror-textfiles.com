     =================================================================

     Seems like every week my mailer queue complains about not having any
     accounting information for a given phone number in the Nodelist. The
     phone companies are going nuts trying to keep up with all the new
     phones and phone number usage like computers, cellphones, faxes, etc.,
     that the telecommunications revolution is creating. Florida has split
     3 Area Codes this year and more are on the horizon.

     The Coordinators are going to be the first to notice a new Area Code
     in their area so I'd like to request they [as a group or individually]
     report these changes and additions to all of us via FidoNews as a .NOT
     [Notice] or .LET [Letter to the Editor]. C'mon NCs, RCs, ZCs, how
     about passing that new info along to the rest of us the easy way?

     And speaking of such prefix numbers, how is the revolution affecting
     number distribution in the other Zones? Are new Country Codes coming
     out as the result of the equipment explosion or has it yet to get to
     that point elsewhere?

     Other than that, it's a typical Issue of typical size. [grin]

     --- Following message extracted from NETMAIL @ 1:18/14 ---

     Subj: Article in FidoNews 14-31

     Hallo Pete & Christopher!

     A reaction to an article in FidoNews 14-31 : "Fido needs piece of
     software".

     This article discusses the need of providing INternet e-mail via
     Netmail using the normal BBS structure. No gateways, but the BBS
     directly calling the Internet. And making it completely transparent to
     the users.

     This is exactly what I do for over a year and a half by now, and soon
     after I started my BBS and mailsystem. I have a UUCP account by an
     ISP, so I can poll for my Internet e-mail and news, just like I call
     for my Fidonet netmail and echomail. Off course I need other software
     to do this, and a kind of gateway (the well-known GIGO program) to
     convert Internet style mail to Fidostyle.

     My points can get a real e-mail address (<username>@medusa.xs4all.nl),
     if they like. Mail sent to that address is received by them as
     netmail. They can send their e-mail to anyone on the internet using
     normal Fidostyle netmail, just use the e-mail address as to-name and a
     special point-address on my system. My editor (GoldED) even
     automatically adds the correct Fido address if it finds a e-mail
     address in the to-field of the header!

     BBS users currently can't do e-mail on my system, but if I want I
     think I can configure that quite easily. It's not required, in Z2 the
     point-system is the most common way of mailing for users.

     All the "extra" software I needed to do this was the Internet polling
     stuff, the gateway, and some lines in my batch-files. For a sysop easy
     to do, and the used software is freeware and good developed. So I
     really don't understand the idea of extra software that should be
     necessary to do this...

     In Z2, R28 all major BBSes provide e-mail and news to their Fido
     points. And many, many of the smaller BBSes (like mine) do the same.
     It's easy to setup after you configured a Fidonet system, and I like
     this way of reading/writing my e-mail better than using a second
     Internet-only editor.

     I call twice a day, sometimes more (manual). For most points this is
     fast enough, because they call only once a day or less. Off course,
     calling every hour or after someone dropping mail is also possible.
     FIDONEWS 14-35               Page 3                    1 Sep 1997


     It's all very easy to configure.

     At my system all Fido stuff is free, for Internet stuff I ask a small
     charge.  It still is much more expensive than Fidonet, and I don't
     have much money. But there are BBSes that provide e-mail for free.

     Files-lists and how to read them
     --------------------------------
     by Eneko Lacunza (2:344/20.13, 2:344/19.11, enlar@iname.com)

     I've always felt that reading and looking through BBS' files-lists is
     quite boring and time loosing: I have to browse over all the list
     (which can be >1Mb!) to figure out what files and programs are
     on-line. Of course, there are some shortcuts: search for strings,
     look at the index, ... but they aren't comfortable if you want to see
     what's on your favorite BBS.

     Finally, some months ago, I decided that it was time to do something.
     So I have written a program that allows the user to browse over the
     areas list, select one and then look at its contents, go back to the
     areas list and select another and so on. It also has an autoFREQ
     feature similar to those found on message editors such GoldEd.

     The questions are: Do you guys think it is useful? Are you interested
     in such a program? Is out there any program that does it?

     The matter is that right now the program speaks Spanish, so I'd like
     to know people's opinion before I take the work to translate it.

     Any comment would be appreciated!
     Eneko.

     Subj: FINALLY!!!

     I am finally back on the Pentium running "full bore".  I was lucky I
     still had the old 486 (8 ram, 340 HD), to at least keep the mail and
     messages flowing during this time.  So no loss of mail or files
     anyway.  Boy that used to be my "top of the line" system.  Now it is
     slower than molasses compared to the big one.  But then I guess it
     didn't bother my Commodore people too much since they have 2 mhz
     machines and 1200/2400 baud modems.  (G)

     Can't believe the problems I've run into in the past 4 weeks.  What
     started out to be a "simple" HD and Modem upgrade turned into the
     biggest pile of crap.  The first thing that happened is I lost the
     Motherboard and a power supply.  Since I had blown all my savings on
     the HD and Modem, I had nothing to buy replacement parts with.  Flat
     broke.

     Well someone squealed on me, and mentioned it on the BBS.  Next thing
     I know, I have donations coming in like crazy.  I received donations
     from a Computer Club and a number of individuals, two of whom donated
     $100 each, and a bunch of smaller ones....which all added up to approx
     $550.  Needless to say I was back in business!!!

     WHO SAID BBS'S ARE DEAD AND NOT APPRECIATED???   NOT THIS ONE!!!!

     I have maintained for a long time, that the problem with most people
     in 'puters these days is that they have progressed so far and have
     totally forgotten the "little people", the ones just starting out, the
     ones with small machines, like 286s, XTs, Commodore, CoCo, and don't
     take the time to help them learn so they can progress too.  Well I
     never forgot what it was like to be a "newbee" and stumbling all over
     some sysops BBS, trying to figure out what to do while being totally
     intimidated by the whirring screens and myriad of confusing commands,
     don't know how to post a message (although we browbeat people to
     post), don't know how to download even a simple file.  I felt if you
     "take care of your Customers" then at some point your Customers "will
     take care of you"!

     Well, with the exception of 2 people...all those that donated all have
     small machines of one type or another, and all were older than the
     "Yuppy Generation".  All those with higher powered fancy machines,
     totally ignored the situation....not even a "gosh I'm sorry to hear
     that"...not a dime.  I think I've learned something in all this....I
     was right!!!

     Back to the 'puter, mostly it was hardware not wanting to play
     FIDONEWS 14-35               Page 6                    1 Sep 1997


     together, then software didn't want to play with hardware, then
     hardware would retaliate against the Software, then some bat files
     played their 'game'...and on and on and on.

     The biggest problem was when people would download QWK packets via
     SFQuick program (SFQ), they would pack, and DSZ would download the
     packet, but when DSZ was to exit and go back to SFQ, it would lock the
     system and give me an error screen, telling me that DSZ is being used
     by another Application.  Well hell, there was NO other application
     running.  I deleted them all just to be sure.  There were some
     installs in the past where i did not have that problem, yet if I
     install direct from the Installation program of OS2...It would cause
     SFQ/DSZ to do the lockup.

     I bet I installed, uninstalled, destalled, astalled, etc., a dozen
     times trying to find it.  I was bound and determined.  Well I still
     don't know what "causes" the problem, but I found a "CURE" for it
     anyway.  One lousy line in the Config Sys "AUTOFAIL=YES".  Not sure
     how it got into some configs in the past and not in others, but as
     long as that line is there SFQ/DSZ work perfectly fine.  Took me 2
     weeks to find it.

     The other major problem was my Mouse and my Sound Card both wanted to
     "own" Irq 5.  The mouse was a serial, so had to use extra serial card,
     and put mouse on com3, irq5 since both modems had 3 and 4.  Well
     neither the soundcard nor mouse would budge, even trying to "fool"
     them with config sys entries.  So finally went down and bought a PS/2
     bus mouse and that solved that problem.  Now they are both "happy".

     Then Tues morn I wake up with the flu or some terrible man-eating
     disease, and was miserable for 2 days.  Trying to install stuff for
     final run thru, since i finally got all the 'bugs' worked out.  But
     just does not work when you feel like you are a limp dishrag.  So quit
     for the night.  This morn I started in again and it all came together,
     got everything installed by 3 pm, and machine purred like a kitten.
     So decided not to wait a min longer.  Shut down the 486, put the two
     HDs in the Pentium and then copied the BBS over to the Pentium Drives.
     Took about 45 mins, and we were up and running.

     So far...so good!!  I hope it's another lifetime before I have to go
     through this again!!!.

     But now we are up with the "big boys and girls" (or catching up,
     anyway).  We still have Pentium 75, but added up to 64 ram,  have a 4
     gig and the old 850 for close to 5 gigs total space.  Now have a 33.6
     on the Mail Node, and moved the Supra 28.8 to the BBS replacing the
     14.4, which is now in the backup 486.  After all the above problems
     figured I earned some "luxuries" so bought a new video and sound card.
     Great...video card has all kinds of stuff my monitor (el cheapo bottom
     of line) won't see.  Well one of these days I hope to get a 17" or 20"
     monitor so I can better read what's on the screen.  Or maybe Santa
     will bring me one!!  (hee hee).

     Now I need to work on the File Areas and Conf Areas, both in bad need
     of revamping.  Now that I have the space, I hope to get a better
     selection of files from the Filebone, at least in some selected areas.

     Well now that I've done my "bragging" and got it out of my system
     (although I think the donation part was justified, the rest...blah),
     it's back to the "hole" and "normal (whatever that is) operation".

     I've scanned the echo, albeit quickly, but think I have the
     "Headlines"...Larry resigns due to work commitments, Tim is now NEC,
     Genie is Temp NC pending Election in which so far she's the only one
     in nomination.  Whoo  Whooo  Whooooo I hear the train a-comin, comin
     round the bend....hee hee.  An Echo list was past out to be reviewed
     and revised.  Think that is most of it.  Now I'll try to get to the
     details in next day or two to get caught up.

     Now I hope that I can be a better "asset" to the Net as a whole, as
     well as to my Super Customers!

     * Monday

      8:05 am User called to say they forgot password. Told them to use
     password retrieval utility called FDISK. Blissfully ignorant, they
     thank me and hang up. God, we let the people vote and drive, too?

      8:12 am Accounting called to say they couldn't access expense reports
     database. Gave them Standard Sys Admin Answer #112, "Well it works for
     me" Let them rant and rave while I unplugged my coffeemaker from the
     UPS and plugged their server back in. Suggested they try it again. One
     more happy customer.

      8:14 am User from 8:05 call said they received error message "Error
     accessing Drive 0. "Told them it was an OS problem. Transferred them
     to microsupport.

      11:00 am Relatively quiet for last few hours Decided to plug support
     phone back in so I can call my girlfriend. Says parents are coming
     into town this weekend. Put her on hold and transferred her to
     janitorial closet down in basement. What is she thinking? The "Myst"
     and "Doom" nationals are this weekend!

      11:34 am Another user calls (do they ever learn?) Says they want ACL
     changed on HR performance review database so nobody but HR can access
     database.  Tell them no problem. Hang up. Change ACL. Add @MailSend so
     performance reviews are sent to */US.

      12:00 pm Lunch

      3:30 pm Return from lunch.

      3:55 pm Wake up from nap. Bad dream makes me cranky. Bounce servers
     for no reason. Return to napping.

      4:23 pm Yet another user calls. Wants to know how to change fonts on
     form.  Ask what chip set they're using. Tell them to call back when
     they find out.

      4:55 pm Decide to run "Create Save/Replication Conflicts" macro so
     next shift has something to do.

     * Tuesday

      8:30 am Finish reading support log from last night. Sounded busy.
     Terrible time with Save/Replication conflicts.

      9:00 am Support manager arrives. Wants to discuss my attitude. Click
     on PhoneNotes SmartIcon. "Love to, but kinda busy. Put something in
     the calendar database!" I yell as I grab for the support lines, which
     have (mysteriously) lit up. Walks away grumbling.

      9:35 pm Team leader from R&D needs ID for new employee. Tell them
     they need form J-19R=9C9\\DARR\K1. Says they never heard of such a
     form.  Tell them it's in the SPECIAL FORMS database. Say they never
     heard of such a database. Transfer them to janitorial closet in
     basement.

      10:00 am Perky sounding intern from R&D calls and says she needs new
     ID.  Tell her I need employee number, department name, manager name,
     and marital status. Run @DbLookup against state parole board database,
     Centers for Disease Controldatabase, and my Oprah Winfrey database. No
     hits.  Tell her ID will be ready tonight. Drawing from the lessons
     learned in last week's "Reengineering for Customer Partnership," I
     offer to personally deliver ID to her apartment.

      10:07 am Janitor stops by to say he keeps getting strange calls in
     basement Offer to train him on Notes. Begin now. Let him watch console
     while I grab a smoke.

      1:00 pm Return from smoking break. Janitor says phones kept ringing,
     so he transferred them to cafeteria lady. I like this guy.

      1:05 pm Big commotion! Support manager falls in hole left where I
     pulled floor tiles outside his office door. Stress to him importance
     of not running in computer room, even if I do yell "Omigod --Fire!"

      1:15 pm Development Standards Committee calls and complains about
     umlauts in form names. Apologizing for the inconvenience, I tell them
     I will fix it.  Hang up and run global search/replace using gaks.

      1:20 pm Mary Hairnet from cafeteria calls. Says she keeps getting
     calls for "Notice Loads" or "NoLoad Goats," she's not sure, couldn't
     hear over industrial-grade blender. Tell her it was probably "Lettuce
     Nodes." Maybe the food distributor with a new product? She thinks
     about it and hangs up.

      2:00 pm Legal secretary calls and says she lost password. Ask her to
     check in her purse, floor of car, and on bathroom counter. Tell her it
     probably fell out of back of machine. Suggest she put duct tape over
     all the airvents she can find on the PC. Grudgingly offer to create
     FIDONEWS 14-35               Page 10                   1 Sep 1997


     new ID for her while she does that.

      2:49 pm Janitor comes back. Wants more lessons. I take off rest of
     day.


     * Wednesday

      8:30 am Irate user calls to say chipset has nothing to do with fonts
     on form. Tell them Of course, they should have been checking "Bitset,"
     not "chipset." Sheepish user apologizes and hangs up.

      9:10 am Support manager, with foot in cast, returns to office.
     Schedules 10:00 am meeting with me. User calls and wants to talk to
     support manager about terrible help at support desk. Tell them manager
     about to go into meeting. Sometimes life hands you material...

      10:00 am Call Louie in janitorial services to cover for me. Go to
     support manager's office. He says he can't dismiss me but can suggest
     several lateral career moves. Most involve farm implements in third-
     world countries with moderate to heavy political turmoil. By and by, I
     ask if he's aware of new bug which takes full-text indexed random e-
     mail databases and puts all references to furry handcuffs and Bambi
     Boomer in Marketing on the corporate Web page. Meeting is adjourned as
     he reaches for keyboard, Web browser, and Tums.

      10:30 am Tell Louie he's doing great job. Offer to show him mainframe
     corporate PBX system sometime.

      11:00 am Lunch.

      4:55 pm Return from lunch.

      5:00 pm Shift change; Going home.


     * Thursday

      8:00 am New guy ("Marvin") started today. "Nice plaids" I offer. Show
     him server room, wiring closet, and technical library. Set him up with
     IBM PC-XT. Tell him to quit whining, Notes runs the same in both
     monochrome and color.

      8:45 am New guy's PC finishes booting up. Tell him I'll create new ID
     for him. Set minimum password length to 64. Go grab smoke.

      9:30 am Introduce Louie the custodian to Marvin. "Nice plaids" Louie
     comments Is this guy great or what?!

      11:00 am Beat Louie in dominos game. Louie leaves. Fish spare dominos
     out of sleeves ("Always have backups"). User calls, says Accounting
     server is down. Untie Ethernet cable from radio antenna (better
     reception) and plug back into hub. Tell user to try again. Another
     happy customer!

      11:55 am Brief Marvin on Corporate Policy 98.022.01: "Whereas all new
     FIDONEWS 14-35               Page 11                   1 Sep 1997


     employee beginning on days ending in 'Y' shall enjoy all proper
     aspects with said corporation, said employee is obligated to provide
     sustenance and relief to senior technical analyst on shift." Marvin
     doubts. I point to "Corporate Policy" database (a fine piece of work,
     if I say so myself!) "Remember, that's DOUBLE pepperoni and NO
     peppers!" I yell to Marvin as he steps over open floor tile to get to
     exit door.

      1:00 pm Oooooh! Pizza makes me so sleepy ...

      4:30 pm Wake from refreshing nap. Catch Marvin scanning want ads.

      5:00 pm Shift change. Flick HR's server off and on several times
     (just testing the On/Off button...). See ya tomorrow.


     * Friday

      8:00 am Night shift still trying to replace power supply in HR
     server.  Told them it worked fine before I left.

      9:00 am Marvin still not here. Decide I might start answering these
     calls myself. Unforward phones from Mailroom.

      9:02 am Yep. A user call. Users in Des Moines can't replicate. Me and
     the Oiuji board determine it's sunspots. Tell them to call
     Telecommunications.

      9:30 am Good God, another user! They're like ants. Says he's in San
     Diego and can't replicate with Des Moines. Tell him it's sunspots, but
     with a two-hour difference. Suggest he reset the time on the server
     back 2 hours.

      10:17 am Pensacola calls. Says they can't route mail to San
     Diego.Tell them to set server ahead three hours.

      11:00 am E-mail from corporate says for everybody to quit resetting
     the time on their servers. I change the date stamp and forward it to
     Milwaukee.

      11:20 am Finish @CoffeeMake macro. Put phone back on hook.

      11:23 am Milwaukee calls, asks what day it is.

      11:25 am Support manager stops by to say Marvin called in to quit.
     "So hard to get good help..." I respond. Support manager says he has
     appointment with orthopedic doctor this afternoon, and asks if I mind
     sitting in on the weekly department head meeting for him. "No
     problem!"

      11:30 am Call Louie and tell him opportunity knocks and he's invited
     to a meeting this afternoon. "Yeah, sure. You can bring your snuff" I
     tell him.

      12:00 am Lunch.

     FIDONEWS 14-35               Page 12                   1 Sep 1997


      1:00 pm Start full backups on UNIX server. Route them to device NULL
     to make them fast.

      1:03 pm Full weekly backups done. Man, I love modern technology!

      2:30 pm Look in support manager's contact management database.

      2:35 pm Appointment for him. He really should be at home resting, you
     know.

     Also set point size to "2" in help databases.

      4:30 pm User calls to say they can't see anything in documents. Tell
     them to go to view, do a "Edit -- Select All", hit delete key, and
     then refresh.  Promise to send them document addendum which says so.

      4:45 pm Another user calls. Says they can't read help documents. Tell
     them I'll fix it. Hang up. Change font to Wingdings.

      4:58 pm Plug coffee maker into Ethernet hub to see what happens. Not
     (too) much.
