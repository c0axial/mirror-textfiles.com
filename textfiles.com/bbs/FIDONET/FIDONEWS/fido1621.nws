     What's Not Happening

          .-- -- -- -- -- -- WHAT'S NOT HAPPENING -- -- -- -- -- --.
          | There isn't always something happening on Fidonet, but |
          | there's always something which isn't happening.  This  |
          | column is dedicated to the lost causes which make Fido |
          | what it isn't today.  Published semi-occasionally...   |

     The Zone 1 Coordinator Election begins it's nomination phase on May
     30th.  Lack of candidates, however, has been no deterrent to the
     debate of issues.  Here are a few issues from the past week which
     should not be a factor in the upcoming election:


     1.  Dallas Hinton posted as Bob Satti.

     Much ado was made over Dallas logging onto Bob's system as Bob and
     posting in his name.  However, it appears that Dallas was merely
     passing on messages dictated by Bob from his hospital bed.  This
     charge fails to establish any intent to defraud on Dallas part, and
     I seriously doubt that even Dallas' detractors will continue to hold
     him in infamy over the technicality that he didn't put his initials
     on the dictated messages.

     It's probably not a good idea for Dallas to list this activity on
     his election resume under "ZC EXPERIENCE," however...


     2.  Region 10 Net Coordinators were not consulted before the R10C
     voted on election methods.

     This turned out to be a simple technical error - the messages posted
     in the R10 regional echoes were lost on one system.  Brenda Donovan,
     as Region 10 Coordinator, continues to enjoy (so fare as I know) a
     reputation for putting information before her region.  The fact that
     the charge was even made is more indicative that there is still a
     deep distrust of regional representation than indicative of any
     actual RC failure.  RCs should, of course, be aware of this
     distrust... but I don't see what more they can do except to continue
     to conduct their business openly and honestly.


     3.  Regional Coordinators sent differing messages to their regions
     in soliciting input concerning election methods for the Z1C.

     It's certain that RC's wrote their regions using their own words
     because there was no common message drafted for this purpose.
     Whether there should have been or not is open for debate, but
     there's been no case established that the differing wording resulted
     in differing input from the regions.
     FIDONEWS 16-21               Page 3                   24 May 1999


     This is unlikely to become an issue in the upcoming election because
     it doesn't express the underlying concern of those expressing the
     complaint.  The underlying concern is that regional input may not be
     accurately reflected whenever the RCs vote.  So long as the concept
     of RC representation is distrusted, or in the absence of independent
     monitoring of regional input, it's unlikely that this issue will be
     resolved in time for the current election.


     4.  Policy 4 does not require open election of the Z1C.

     This argument has normally been advanced whenever criticism of the
     current election process has become severe.  The implication is that
     sysops should be content with whatever input they've been granted to
     the selection process, because they're not entitled to any by
     policy.  Policy firmly places ZC selection in the RC's hands and
     does not address the method of selection they use.

     This is unlikely to become an election issue because it represents
     an extreme viewpoint - as extreme as the viewpoint that Fidonet
     sysops can void policy merely by withdrawing from Fido and reforming
     the net.  However, the facts are that RCs have chosen to make part
     of the election process open, and sysops have chosen to attempt to
     work within the existing structure.  Extremes have no place in the
     upcoming election.
