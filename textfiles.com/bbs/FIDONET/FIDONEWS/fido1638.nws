     For personal reasons, Henk Wolsink has retired as Fidonews Editor
     and has appointed me to replace him.  I'd like to thank Henk for a
     job well done:  though we disagreed on some issues, I was always
     free to speak my mind here.
     
             Doug Myers - new Editor, still wet behind the ears.

     =================================================================

                              Fidonews Direction

     I didn't get an operator's manual when Henk turned Fidonews over to
     me, so cut me some slack if I make a mistake or two along the way.
     For the moment, I have no "admin" address (though I did communicate
     with Bob Satti about the change and got a response).  Nor am I sure
     if the "editor@fidonews.org" address is pointed in my direction yet
     or not.  Please use one of the addresses in the above banner for
     your letters or article submissions for now.

     I'm expecting TIC distribution of Fidonews to be working for this
     issue.  Though untested until this release, George Peace has changed
     his configuration so that I may hatch into the FIDONEWS file area.
     From George, distribution should be the same as it's been, since
     Henk was releasing to George also.

     I'm not sure if the HTML page at fidonet.org will be working right
     away or not.  Both Henk and I posted to Jim Barchuk telling him of
     the editor change, but I haven't seen a response from him as of
     Sunday morning.  I'll be sending Jim a copy via internet email and
     hoping for the best :)

     But those are present concerns, and this is supposed to be about
     direction, which concerns the future.  In general, I'm pleased with
     the tradition of Fidonews as a free press and plan to continue that
     tradition.  This means that there is no official Fidonews position
     on issues, only the position of the individuals who editorialize on
     those issues.  It further means that I won't be rejecting any
     contributions because I may disagree with the writer.

     For a free press to work, it requires input from many so that it
     doesn't degrade into a mere soapbox for the editor.  This seems
     intuitive for political commentary, but it's even true for objective
     reporting - the decision as to what news to present shouldn't rest
     with just the editor.  To this end, I'd like to encourage
     contributions from the folks reading Fidonews (I know there's a
     bunch of you)... these contributions might be in the form of article
     submissions or in the form of feedback.

     Watch the FIDONEWS echo for a discussion on direction.  I'll be
     asking for feedback on some of my ideas, and hoping that YOU will
     have some ideas to contribute.  Here's an initial list of ideas I'll
     be posting for feedback:

     * Add a section to the masthead listing the Fidonews Staff.  This is
     somewhat complicated right now because there is no staff (though Joe
     Jared has taken upon himself to keep up some of the internet
     information and should be in there).  The Staff would be a list of
     frequent contributors with node numbers and email addresses as well
     as a descriptive title.  Staff members could identify their work
     with a simple byline, confident that their contact information is
     already listed.

     * Solicit a Bureau Chief from each zone to report on happenings in
     that zone.

     * Encourage Zone Coordinators to publish "state of the Zone"
     articles for all readers.

     * Publish internet listings only when updated rather than every
     issue.

     * Further reduce masthead clutter.

     * Solicit someone from the FTSC to write a series on "FTSC for the
     Complete Idiot"... something that even *I* can understand.

     (---- Echomail, Zone 1 Backbone, by Lisa Gronke, 1:105/40 ----)

     There seems to be some confusion about the meaning of the word
     "mesh."

     I view "mesh" as a synonym for "fully connected polygon," a topology
     that uses standard FidoNet SEEN-BY technology and does not lose
     messages or create dupes. It is true that a "fully connected
     polygon" which is broken (i.e. not fully connected) will generate
     dupes. The solution to that is to either repair the broken
     connection or change the topology to hub-and-spoke (incidentally, a
     "broken triangle" IS hub-and-spoke).

     Alec, on the other hand, is trying to implement redundancy (i.e.
     receiving more than one copy of each and every echomail message)
     with software that was specifically designed to avoid redundancy.

     NNTP, for example, is designed for redundancy.
      server: I've got news article 12345678@psg.com
      client: gimme
      server: here it comes
      server: I've got news article 23456789@agora.rdrop.com
      client: don't send, already have it
      etc.
     Using NNTP, a client can connect to as many news servers as he
     wishes (until the gimme ratio becomes zero).

     Alec wants to receive two or more copies of each echomail message,
     sending the first one he receives to his downlinks and throwing the
     second, third etc. copy away. One problem he has is that "duplicate"
     messages from different uplinks are not really identical (they have
     different SEEN-BY lines).

     (-------------------------------------------------------------)

     I figured that any multipath connection is a mesh of sorts, whether
     seen-by's control the dupes or not.  However, you're the
     term-meister... I'll find another word in the future.  How about
     "mess?"

     FIDONEWS 16-38               Page 4                   20 Sep 1999


     Isn't what Alec is doing somewhat the same as the sequence you
     describe with the NNTP server, except that he's using CRC
     calculations for the message identifier (or MSGID supplied), and
     he's discarding the mail he doesn't want rather than telling the
     server not to send it:
             server:  Here's message 83923
             client:  got it for the first time, I'll pass it on.
             server:  Here's message 69364
             client:  got it for the third time... in the trash!

     You raise a good point that Alec will receive different SEEN-BY
     lines depending on which path gives him a particular message first.
     But isn't this somewhat analogous to the ZHUB practice (past if not
     current) of stripping all SEEN-BY's except for their immediate
     downlinks (Tiny SEEN-BY's)?  How was that controlled?

     To be honest, I don't see why duplicates aren't a bigger problem
     than they appear to be.  With everyone able to tunnel through the
     internet and get echomail anywhere they want, there can't really be
     a pure implementation of a fully connected polygon... someone's
     going to open it up somewhere.  And most tossers don't store CRC
     codes long enough to detect duplicates which are received more than
     a few days apart.

     Doug, please don't play reporter when you don't have the facts.

     1. I've been connecting to both backbones since day 1. The only
        problem until recently was that I used a single outbound.

        No dupes in over a year.

     2. I am not intending to establish a mesh. I am ensuring the most
        complete feed - for reasons that go beyond FIDO.

     Consider what's been happening with your Email feed. The mail moves
     thru here fast enough - and goes nowhere because of bottlenecks in
     ERN. To sites more directly connected, the speed is in minutes.

     Also - John did not disconnect from the nodes to ensure no dupes.
     That came after he had already disconnected from 104/1.

      Alec, I appreciate your efforts to provide facts where you feel
      they are missing, but I don't need your demeaning advice about my
      play time.  We're all playing here - that's the nature of a hobby.
      I don't plan on criticizing you for playing mail mover :)

     Wrong.  They are just more public now since multiple distribution
     systems are involved.

     Your article about email surcharges is, I'm glad to say, a hoax.
     It's been reported and debunked several times over the past 2 or 3
     years.

     There is a web site (I've forgotten the address) which tracks such
     hoaxes -- you might want to check it out....

     Cheers... Dallas

     (--------------------------------------------------------------)

      I kinda figured it was a hoax.  It sounded like one of those urban
      legends which finds a life of it's own, not impeded by reality.  I
      wasn't really trying to alert anyone... it just made a good lead in
      to the rest of the editorial's caustic remarks :)

     History has proven the detractors of Bob Satti wrong.  They thought
     that Bob could never hold on as Zone 1 Coordinator if there were
     ever to be a participatory election...

     Well, it's been two and a half months, and Bob is still at the top
     of the nodelist.  Of course, we elected David Moufarrege...

     ... by a landslide, actually.  David was full of good ideas which
     captured the imagination of those who held hope for a better zone 1.
     It's not as if Fido is in dire straits with the experienced hand of
     Bob Satti at the helm... but it's been two and a half months.

     To be fair, David delayed assuming his elected position citing
     family problems which had priority.  Now it's tough to criticize a
     man who puts family ahead of his hobby... but it's been two and a
     half months.

     David, our hearts are with you in your time of difficulty.  You
     don't deserve to be the top story in the What's Not Happening
     column... but it's been two and a half months.
