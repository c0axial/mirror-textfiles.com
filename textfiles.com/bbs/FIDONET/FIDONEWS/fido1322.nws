The location has changed, but the fun and friendship will be the same

and the price goes up to $45 on 1 October.  Register early to save!
Hotel reservations may be made by calling the Holiday Inn at
(407)7832271.  Be sure to mention the Space Coast Area Mensa RG to get
the special RG room rate of $58 per night for 1 to 4 people.

We again will be offering a meal plan consisting of a Saturday evening
banquet and a Sunday brunch, Either meal also may be ordered
individually.  Meals must be ordered in advance so the final numbers
can be confirmed to the hotel.

We also will be offering RG tee shirts again this year.  The shirts
will be heather gray in color with the SCAM Tourist Trap RG 96 logo.
The tee shirts are being printed based on the advance orders received,
so don't wait until you arrive to think about buying one. Only a few
of these shirts will be available for purchase on site.
