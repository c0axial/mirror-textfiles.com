     Bob Allman, 161/8 and 123/7


                     Fee Based Bulletin Board Systems:
            Bill Paul's FidoNews 4-37 Article and the Responses


        Bill Paul, Sysop of The Think Tank, 123/7, Memphis, Tennessee,
     authored an article which outlined his thoughts on BBS fee
     charging practices and solicited feedback from others.  What I
     seek here is to provide a synopsis of the feedback he shared with
     me and offer my own observations.

        Bill queried the propriety of users financially supporting a
     hobby, and equated fees received with obligations incurred by the
     recipient.  He did acknowledge echomail and netmail services were
     legitimately chargeable to users of those services.  Responses
     were received from among others: 381/20, 107/16, 381/1, 148/1,
     115/478, a PC-Board SysOp, a Miami SysOp and Don Daniels,
     President of IFNA.  Here, with apologies to the respondents for
     any loss of context, are the major points made:

        - Fee payers' are better and more committed users.
        - User support, financial and otherwise, is conducive to
          system excellence and longevity.
        - Fees seperate users who want a system's services from
          curiosity seekers and twits.
        - Fees reduce system access gridlock problems.
        - Fees can be mandatory for access, tied to special
          priviledges only, or solicited analogous to the shareware
          concept (eg your donation will be gratefully accepted).
        - Fee supported systems do incur some obligations on the part
          of the operators consistant with the fee basis.
        - Users do derive benefits, systems are only as good as the
          sysops AND their users - hence BBSs' are two way streets.
        - System operation is expensive.
        - Hobby activity and community service don't have to be
          mutually exclusive.
        - FidoNet shouldn't include any system designed and operated
          exclusively to make money.
        - Bulletin Board Systems and Electronic Mail Networks are
          different; BBSs can be free, networks require management and
          appropriate financial involvement.
        - No one rule can be equally applied to every BBS.


         Having been involved in a user group initiative to provide
     funding to a Net to help defray costs, I know that responsible
     users, concerned with both the benefits received from excellent
     systems and the commensurate high costs of operating good systems
     are not unwilling to donate their time or money unsolicited by
     SysOps.  Bill's issue, I believe, was on what basis should money
     FidoNews 4-46                Page 2                   14 Dec 1987


     change hands.  Is it a form of contract, with obligations on the
     part of both parties?  I think so.  The terms "user" and
     "operator" alone impart a sense of this relationship.  I have no
     tolerance for board "rapists" and twits who believe access to
     systems are their god given right, nor SysOps who want monies up
     front without providing a trial period to permit prospective
     users to reasonably evaluate their fee-based systems.  Let them
     both be plagued with gridlock, line noise and faulty modems!  I
     believe that non-profit making fees are an acceptable option for
     System Operators.  But the option does incur obligations to
     provide services commensurate with the fee charged.  This is
     rarely a problem as most fee structures are nominal, and I know
     of no case of a system going fee-based only to shut down within
     weeks without making appropriate refunds.

         My preference is that any fee-based system be willing to
     extend to prospective new users a short "check it out" period.
     Sure, downloads and to a lesser degree, message base access can
     be limited, but no one likes to invest in anything sight unseen.
     I find too many of the "new" fee-based systems want money before
     you can see anything but the logon welcome, registration form,
     and the logoff screen.  Good systems have nothing to fear from
     scrutiny and that is the basis upon which the appropriateness of
     fees should be judged.

         To set the record straight, I have been active in
     telecommunications for number of years and, although having moved
     from Tennessee to California in July 1986, I continue to be a
     registered user of Bill's system.  I have never been a SysOp,
     although I have Sub-SysOped or SigOped for several systems.  I am
     an active user of electronic mail networks and message bases.  I
     am NOT speaking for Bill, although I publicly wish to thank him
     for providing the Think Tank's great forum.

     Replies may be addressed to 123/7 or 161/8.

                   Benchmark Testing Of Archive Utilities

         With the release of version 1.5 of the Zoo archive utility, I
     decided to run my benchmark tests  and  report  on  the  3  major
     archive utilities again.

         For  those  of  you that have read my past articles,  you are
     familiar with these tests.  For new readers,  I will explain  the
     tests now.

         The test are run against a standard collection of 14 files  I
     have put aside for these types of tests. The total size of the 14
     files together are 269118 bytes. Some are .COM, some are .EXE and
     some are .OVL files.  The times reported below are the average of
     10 tests for each program I tested.

         The equipment I run the test on has changed. I am now using a
     QT/2-6 computer.

         This is a PS/60 clone  with  twelve  (12)  Megabytes  of  Ram
     installed on the motherboard.  The clock speed is 20Mhz. An 80386
     is the main processor.  An 80387 NDP is installed  as  well.  The
     hard  drive  used  for testing is a Seagate ST-251 with an access
     time of 23 ms. The price of the QT/2-6 is $2450 as tested.

         A seperate sub-directory was created  for  testing  purposes.
     The  drive  was  optimized  (Mace  4.10) between tests to provide
     accurate results.  OS/2 (Beta) was used as the  operating  system
     for these tests.

         Here are the time results of the tests.

         NAME     TYPE OF OPERATION   %  REDUCED  MINS  SECS HUDS
         ========================================================
         PKARC35  Create An Archive   34 Percent   00    09   02
         ZOO150   Create An Archive   33 Percent   00    17   06
         ARC520   Create An Archive   33 Percent   00    56   13

         PKXARC   Extract An Archive      N/A      00    05   14
         ZOO150   Extract An Archive      N/A      00    07   15
         ARCE     Extract An Archive      N/A      00    07   21
         ARC520   Extract An Archive      N/A      00    42   14

         KEY: N/A=Not Applicable In This Test

         As you can see PKARC has come in again as the fastest utility
     for  creating  an  archive.  PKXARC  is  the  fastest  extraction
     utility.  ARC520 still does not recognize other archive  formats.
     PKARC35  will  produce either it's own ARC format file or you may
     produce  an  ARC520  formatted  file.  ZOO150  creates  it's  own
     formatted file.

         As  computer  speeds get faster,  I expect to see these times
     remain relatively stable.  The work these  programs  do  is  disk
     FidoNews 4-46                Page 4                   14 Dec 1987


     intensive.  I  expect that in the future speed gains will be from
     faster drives, and not from faster computers.

         I hope this helps some of you who are new to computers.

                                   GizLib
                     A Fine Improvement To Quick Basic

     GIZLIB is a set of routines that are callable from either QB3  or
     QB4.  Some,  such as ERRMSG, more resemble sub-programs than sub-
     routines.  To say this is not to overstate their  value,  but  to
     point out that,  in general, they perform or can perform multiple
     functions or entire routines.

     Most of the routines are assembler based, but where it makes more
     sense,  they are in QB.  In terms of speed  and  such,  assembler
     based  is  undoubtedly  faster (though I doubt that the amount by
     which it is faster is always noticeable) QB routines on the other
     hand can be a bit more useful,  the  most  noticeable  difference
     being   that  QB  subroutines  can  alter  string  lengths  while
     assembler cannot.  The downside is that QB  routines  are  a  bit
     bigger,  but I still appreciate having them right on hand and not
     having to type them in numerous times.

     II.  Calling Conventions

     If you are not familiar with calling library  routines  from  QB,
     you  are  advised  to  STUDY  this  in the QB books,  as it is an
     important aspect of calling sub programs.

         Brief Rules:

         A.  The passed parameters shown do not need to be used
     literally as is. That is, if a routine is documented as:

             CALL myroutine(StringParm$, IntegerParm%)

             The following convention will work just as well:
             CALL myroutine(parm1$, parm2%)

             The following will not (because the variable data
             types are reversed):

             CALL myroutine(StringParm%, IntegerParm$)

            What this is saying is that called  subroutine  parameters
     are  only  POSITIONAL,  but  they  can  have  any name you choose
     ("IntegerParm%" vs "parm2%"),  and as long as the TYPE is correct
     (integer  versus string variables,  versus double precision etc),
     and as long as the passed arguments are initialized correctly.

         B.  Unless otherwise noted,  subroutines  require  non-string
     arguments  to  be  INTEGERS.  This means that either a DEFINT a-z
     statements is required  early  on  in  your  program  or  numeric
     arguments must be implicitly set to integers, ie; the "%" integer
     declaration used.



         C.  Aside  from the right TYPE of argument or parameter being
     passed,  and the use of integers,  make sure you pass  the  right
     FidoNews 4-46                Page 6                   14 Dec 1987


     NUMBER  of  arguments.  If  a  program  requires  you  to  pass 7
     arguments and either as a typo or because you  only  use  6,  you
     miss one within the parentheses,  then as they say, unpredictable
     results may occur.

         D.   In  most  cases,   the  examples  shown  will  reference
     parameters as variables.

         ie:  CALL  subr(x%,  y%,  z$);  where x,  y and z$ are set to
     certain values to get specific results from the routine.  However
     in many cases, you can pass arguments directly.

         ie:  CALL subr(1, 4, "String").  The times when you CANNOT do
     such direct passing is when the subroutine is going to modify  or
     return  one  of  the arguments passed.  Some routines will change
     one of the arguments to indicate an error or a level of success.

         Those arguments that are altered or changed by the subroutine
     MUST be passed as a variable.  For example,  if "subr" above uses
     x,  y and z$ to specify what you want it to do and  y  returns  a
     level  of success or error situation,  it would have to be passed
     as a variable:

         CALL subr(1, y%, "String")


         E.  Major QB 3.0 bug

         There is a fairly well known bug in  QB3  that  creates  non-
     executing   .EXE  files  when  your  program  performs  calls  to
     assembler routines. The work around is this:

         DO NOT compile your source from INSIDE the editor to  make  a
     .OBJ file.

         DO exit to DOS and make the .OBJ file from DOS:

         C>QB myprog /o;

         Then when you link it, the EXE file will run.

         By  "fairly  well  known  bug" I mean that most serious users
     know about it.  I have let MicroSoft know and provided 4 examples
     and they now understand what the problem is,  but DO NOT expect a
     fix  for it,  because they are more intent on OS/2 and QB4 is now
     out.

         Here is a brief list of the available commands in GizLib  and
     a brief description of each one.

     If you are interested in metaphysical  topics,  expanding  and/or
     opening  your  mind  to  new  thoughts,  or just curious then you
     should drop by StarSeed -- A New  Age  BBS  in  Albuquerque,  New
     Mexico.  It's  Node 15/1001 or you can call direct (505) 822-8268
     AFTER 10 p.m.  Mountain Standard Time (10 pm - 10 am, daily).


     A special discussion  area  called  Stargate  offers  interesting
     comments  on  a  wide  range of New Age topics.  WHAT IS NEW AGE?
     Well,  Omni Magazine took a stab at defining it in their  October
     issue.  It  was  described  as  a  consciousness,  a concept,  an
     alternative religion,  a sub-culture,  a new era,  and a holistic
     approach  to  life.  I  would say it's all of the above.  It's an
     open-minded  search  for  answers   to   life's   questions.   It
     encompasses  such  things as astrology,  sciences of the mind and
     body,  herbal  medicine,   native  american  practices,   eastern
     religion  and other alternative religions,  earth magic,  crystal
     power, the supernatural and/or para-normal.

     On the lighter side,  there  is  also  a  great  Science  Fiction
     Conference  and  "OddQuest"  --  a  silly  adventure  game  (just
     starting).


     StarSeed has been in operation around 6  months  (the  same  Fido
     Node has been around for over four years).  I would like to start
     a  New  Age Echo Conference if the interest is out there.  If you
     are so inclined,  drop by StarSeed.  If any nodes are  interested
     in such an echo, please contact me at 15/1001.

     NEVERBOARD -- 129/17


                 DUPLICATION OF ECHOMAIL CONFERENCES


       If you are keeping track of the various echomail conferences
     that are forming almost daily, you will have noticed a rather
     distressing trend: DUPLICATION OF SUBJECT MATTER. An example:

       For more than two years (since before echomail) there has
     been a discussion area on my board called "Electric Images".
     When I let it out into the rest of the matrix I shortened the
     name to simply "IMAGES". The subject of the conference has been
     movies, via both theatre and videocassette, and "regular" video
     as in "TV". As of last month, it had made it's way across the
     country and had many enthusiastic participants.

       Then I started seeing an area available on some of the large
     echo hubs called "FILM", as well as another called "REVIEWS".
     Both were supposed to have the same subject matter as IMAGES.

       I started out by entering messages into these echoes, asking
     who the coordinator was. I got no response (well, almost no
     response; one person replied saying "coordinator? what's a
     coordinator? why do we need one?") I tried again, this time
     asking "if there is no coordinator, could someone at least tell
     me who started this thing?" No response. Finally, after I
     arranged to actually receive both echoes on my board, I decided
     to concede to the greater distribution of FILM (which actually
     had some messages in it) and merge my own conference into it by
     renaming it to FILM. Meanwhile, after several more tries, still
     no one answers to the title of coordinator in REVIEWS.

       I am also seeing three different but similar "MUSIC" echoes,
     and many more along those lines. The point is, I thought that we
     had an "official keeper of the echolist" (Thomas Kenny) who puts
     out an excellent list of echoes, along with their coordinators
     and hub numbers. Heck, it was even included inside this very
     newsletter! I guess not everyone reads it.

       I don't have any particular solution to this problem, except
     to say that I hope in the future that sysops, echomail
     coordinators and all others involved in distribution will keep a
     closer watch on what is actually going around, subject-wise.
     I should also point out that experience has shown that an echo
     with no coordinator doesn't last very long, and at best will
     degenerate into random discussion and flames.

       I would also like to take this opportunity to plug some of
     the echoes that I coordinate here at NEVERBOARD:

       SHORTWAVE - discussion of radio listening, including long-
     distance reception on HF bands, as well as broadcast band,
     scanners, satellites, and "PIRATE" radio. No ham radio.
     FidoNews 4-46                Page 11                  14 Dec 1987


       AUDIO - discussion of stereo equipment and accessories,
     sound reinforcement, tips for improved sound, and the recordings
     that provide the best examples of Hi Fi.

       FILM - discussion of movies, including those in theatres, on
     videocassette and broadcast. Also video hardware such as HDTV,
     Hi Fi VCRs, and satellite TV.

       DR_DEBUG - The one and only! He's a little eccentric and yes,
     he has been known to spill a little Gin on his magnetic media.
     But you won't find a better authority on software for a variety
     of computers, including IBM, COMMODORE, APPLE and ATARI. Ask
     here, if he can't answer it then you don't need to know. The
     Doctor is IN!

       We also carry MUSIC, SF, HUMOR and many other conferences.
       Come and get it!

     Subj:  TROJAN ALERT


     It seems SOFTGUARD  may  be  distributing  a  TROJAN  "unprotect"
     program  to  erase  disks  and  bolster  their  "shrinking"  copy
     protection business.

                     - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

     The following message was found on the Morningstar Keep  node  of
     the  Citadel  BBS  system (609)268-9597.  What makes this message
     especially  alarming  is  the  fact  that,   as  far  as  can  be
     ascertained,  so-called  "shrink-wrap"  license  agreements  have
     never been shown to be enforceable in a court of law.  Thus,  not
     only  is  it  probably legal for you to make a backup copy of so-
     called  "licensed  software",  but  if  the  publisher  omits  to
     register the work with the Copyright office and submit two copies
     of  the  software to the Library of Congress,  he may not even be
     entitled to attorney's fees and punitive damages even if he  sues
     you for real dishonest copyright infringement.  (If the publisher
     does register the work with the copyright office,  it  becomes  a
     published work and it becomes impossible for the publisher to get
     any  kind  of  trade secret protection,  or enforce a prohibition
     against reverse-engineering.  (There goes the software protection
     scheme!!  --  A  delightful  dilemma for the software publisher.)
     Consult your attorney for specific legal advice, but make sure he
     doesn't consult for a software company.  R.DHESI

     **** DANGER !!!!  Data Destroying Program !!!

     The file called SUG.ARC  (or  SUG.COM)  is  purported  to  be  an
     unprotect for Softguard.  It is,  in reality,  a real WORM of the
     worst magnitude!  This little  gem  will  ask  you  to  put  your
     ORIGINAL Softguard protected disk in the drive,  and then BAM, it
     displays this message:


     "You have violated the license agreement under which you received
     the  software.   All  your  data   has   been   destroyed.   This
     destruction  constitutes  prima  facia  evidence of your criminal
     violation. If you attempt to challenge Softguard Systems, Inc. or
     the software vendor in court, you will be vigorously counter-sued
     for infringement and theft of services;  we believe that our case
     will have more merit to it than yours.  If you have any questions
     concerning this matter, you are invited to contact our lawyers at
     the following address:

          Softguard Systems Incorporated
          address and telephone number given -.

     We'll  be  happy  to explain to you the precarious legal position
     you're in.  We wish you good luck in restoring your software from
     backups and we hope that in the future you'll act  more  like  an
     honest user and less like a thief.

              Happy Computing."

     ... AND IT IS SERIOUS!!

     It will look for drives A:  & B:  and,  get this,  a drive C:  or
     better!!  In other words,  it will wipe out the FAT on your  hard
     disk too,  just to "teach you a lesson".  Attorneys are presently
     looking into what  can  be  done  to  stick  this  up  the  lower
     abdominal  region  of  the person or persons responsible for it's
     existence.

     .. IF YOU HAVE IT, GET RID OF IT !!!

     Subj: SUG.ARC                           Sec'ty: PUBLIC
     MESSAGE

     Please  take  a  look  at  SUG.ARC  which  purports  to unprotect
     Softguard, but destroys the diskette by erasing all files but not
     the FAT.  It appears to be in retaliation  for  your  work.  More
     than  ever  we  need  your help with SOFTGUARD 3.00.  The lecture
     that goes along with SUG.ARC is too much!!!

     - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

     Assuming that Softguard really did create this file,  we have the
     following comments.

     First,  Softguard's  battle (battle?  You might prefer to call it
     terrorism) against protection busters is almost  moot,  for  most
     major   software  publishers  have  dropped  the  idea  of  copy-
     protection altogether in favor of  registered  customer  support.
     Perhaps  this  very fact has put Softguard's management in a mood
     bad enough to lash out thus.

     Second, Softguard's legal position seems quite shaky to me.  Last
     year Vault corporation announced  a  software  protection  scheme
     that  would,  if  it  detected  a  fraudulent  effort to copy the
     software, make "Vietnam look like a birthday party" (or some such
     thing) by planting a worm that would slowly  but  surely  destroy
     the  user's  files.  When  Vault  announced it's worm-based copy-
     protection  scheme,   many  knowledgeable  people  expressed  the
     FidoNews 4-46                Page 14                  14 Dec 1987


     opinion  that Vault was likely to be liable for damages if people
     lost valuable data because of the scheme.  What  Softguard  seems
     to  be doing is definitely more vicious.  Add together a probably
     unenforceable license agreement (to which Softguard isn't even  a
     party  as  for  as  the  user is concerned) and clear evidence of
     vicious attempt to destroy the user's data, and you have a pretty
     good case against SUG.ARC's creator.  In  fact,  you  could  very
     easily  create a test case by (a) taking a legally-purchased copy
     of Softguard-protected software;  (b) unpacking it  without  ever
     reading the "license agreement" in a state other than the handful
     (such  as  Louisiana  and  Illinois)  that  attempt  to make such
     agreements enforceable; (c) having some valuable software on your
     hard disk;  (d) "accidentally" destroying any backup copy already
     provided;  and  (e)  trying to make a backup copy of the original
     with the help of SUG.ARC.  It would be interesting  to  see  what
     would   happen   if   you   then   sued  Softguard  for  damages.
     Interesting, but not very surprising.

     We think therefore that  the  Softguard  folks  (if  SUG.ARC  did
     indeed  originate  from  them)  are relying on the individual not
     having the financial resources to sue them or to withstand a long
     legal battle if they  sue  him.  It's  therefore  a  strategy  of
     intimidation.

     (As  an  aside:  That  such a strategy of intimidation could be a
     viable one demonstrates  a  major  flaw  in  this  legal  system.
     Justice costs a lot,  sometimes so much that one can't afford it.
     There are several reasons  for  this,  all  avoidable,  but  none
     appropriate for discussion in the message or under this topic.)

     How do users fight back?

     Perhaps  we won't have to.  It may be enough that the presence of
     this dangerous file be made widely known.

     Possibly as a result of the  public  outcry  that  followed  it's
     announcement  of  the  worm  scheme,  Vault  went into Chapter 11
     bankruptcy -- poetic justice,  I think.  This left Softguard with
     a near-monopoly on the software protection business in the IBM PC
     world.

     If the SUG.ARC file is indeed Softguard's creation, then it seems
     to  me they are following Vault down the Yellow Brick Road (or is
     it the garden path?) --  and  we  look  forward  to  more  poetic
     justice when the public outcry occurs again.

     (As  an additional aside:  Don't rule out the possibility that an
     outside party has created  this  file.  There  are  a  number  of
     people  out  there  that  do  not like BBS's and do not like free
     exchange of information.  These people have defined their goal in
     life to destroy all  means  of  public  information  interchange,
     including and especially, the BBS environment!)
