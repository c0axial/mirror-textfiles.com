Editorial from afar (temporally)
by Tom Jennings

This is a canned editorial that will repeat every week like a bad cold
unless Tim Pozar stops it. (Written 19 June 91)

I will be out of town until 1 Aug 1991. Tim Pozar is acting as editor
(he's on the masthead, in case you didn't notice). He can be reached
at 1:125/555. Articles etc still go to 1:1/1. Probably most of the
projects I initiated are on hold until I return. 'Salright, we lasted
this long without them.

Oh yes, about the price on the "cover" --

If you remember the PHRACK electronic-newsletter bust, it was claimed
that it was not protected under the First Amendment of the U.S.
Constitution, because it was not a print publication!! Which is
patently absurd, of course, but there you go.

As a short-term solution, until the perpetrators of such nonsense
get straightened out, I offer the following short-term solution:
offer your "electronic" newsletter in print. I have done this to
FidoNews, as an example of how to implement it (see the boilerplate
in the back for a sample), rather than because there is anything of
interest to law-enforcement types.

To state the obvious, FidoNews is still completely without cost
of any kind. The "price" simply covers the cost of manually printing
and mailing the thing. No one has taken me up on it yet.

Hey! Bye! Have a nice trip! (Wait... that's your line!)


----------------------------------------------------------------------

One more thing:

PGP ("Pretty Good Privacy") has been the single most popular
download/filerequest I've ever had on my board (See FidoNews 8/24)
short of Fido/FidoNet itself.

Aargh. I'm so embarrassed I am glad I'm out of town ... the
compression method is back to LHARC, but 1.13-level compatibility.
Before you seriously consider conspiracies, consider this: not one
single person offered that (1) LHARC 1.13 is considered the
"universal" compression method or that (2) that is what I should have
been using all along for FidoNews.

Zone 1 Nodelist Comments Revisited
George Peace
1:1/0

Hi! I saw the [zone 1] nodelist comments in the latest F'News and
thought I'd offer a tidbit. Those nodelist comments are rather
imposing when imported en masse (as ;S ...). When I took on the
Z1C job I started installing a unique prefix on the announcements
section to [try to] make extraction and distribution a bit
easier. I never offered any official statement as to intent or
application because I was concerned that a few would demand that
FTS-0005 be updated in order to make the practice "official".
Well, they've lasted [informally] a year now so maybe they'll
last yet another.

All announcements I insert in the Zone 1 nodediff will be on
lines prefixed with

;S |

That's actually a 5 character sequence including a trailing
blank. That sequence carries forward through blank lines as well.
So a rather elementary script might be used to extract the
comments into a reproducable and perhaps even publishable format.

Here's a starter script using tools the MS-DOS users among us
already have available. This is a manually entered script.
Automation requires a few changes...

   FIND ";S | " NODELIST.172 >COMMENTS.172
   EDLIN COMMENTS.172
   R;S | ^Z
   E

The ^Z is a a CTRL-Z character followed by <Enter>.

I'll do my best to limit comment lines to 65 characters for
easier extraction and publishing.

Considering the international flair of today's FidoNet I believe
any comments reposted in F'News should be identified by Zone. The
nodelist is published independently in each zone and as such Z1C
shouldn't pretend or appear to represent any other zone.

Thanks for listening...

Fredric L. Rice
FidoNet 1:102/901.0

Getting tired of being flamed for your spelling mistakes? I sure the
hell was so I did something about it! No, I didn't educate myself!
I've asked my computer to think a little more for me: The MsgSpell
project!

This program will scan through the message areas you describe in the
configuration file and will check each message it finds for spelling
errors.

The configuration file determines if the project is to be run as an
automated process or as an interactive process. Usually, you would
run the program after answering your mail or entering messages into
a conference. -- You and your users, perhaps. But you _could_ run it
automatically.

If run as an automated process, all unknown words are placed within
brackets [] and the messages are moved to a holding directory until
it's been examined by the operator. A lot of work, perhaps, for the
SysOp. -- I should say a lot of _additional_ work. (The problem with
automated mode is that if you are checking more than one AREA:, the
messages would need to be tossed to the correct directory again
after you corrected the spelling errors. Very time wasteful.

If run as an interactive session, the unknown words will cause the
operator to be prompted to (A)dd the word to the dictionary, (E)dit
the word so that it's replaced in the text, (I)gnore the word, or
(M)ark the word with brackets []. In any event, the message that had
been corrected is destroyed and then re-created with the corrections
you requested. The message number isn't changed, and neither is the
date; only the message text.

Kludge lines are _not_ looked upon as something to test for spelling
errors! Neither are the subject lines. Origin lines _are_ as are
tear lines.

The project will mark each message as having been spell checked;
messages will not be selected to be checked for spelling if it has
already been checked once. (This is done by using the times-read flag
in the message header and is documented better in the document file
that comes with the project.)

If you don't want to correct the spelling of everyone's mail, you
can configure a list of names of everyone (or just yourself) you wish
to correct spelling for. Messages that are entered locally, have not
been sent yet, and were entered by either of the personal names you
describe, will be checked for spelling.

If you want all messages that were entered locally to be checked for
spelling, you simply don't configure anyone's name and all local
messages which have not been sent yet will be checked.

FidoNews 8-25                  Page 6                      24 Jun 1991


The dictionary is the work of Samuel H. Smiths's project 'EZSPELL.'
The File EZSPELL.DCT was used for initial spelling checking and then
later added to by taking FidoNews issues, running them through
commercial spelling checks, and then importing FidoNews into network
messages. Then the MsgSpell project was run on those FidoNews
messages and new words were added. In this way, the dictionary is
tailored towards the BBS community -- Well, FidoNet anyway. (The
Group Mail documentation was also used to add words to the dictionary
in this same way.)

As with most of the software projects that come from my keyboard, the
sourCe code comes with the project. The file is called MSGSPELL.LZH
and can be requested with the magic file name of SPELL. Source code
is provided so that if faster routines are developed, the updates may
be disseminated through-out the network. In addition, you may not
like the way I did some things so you're free to correct them. It
would be nice if the project offered suggested spellings in the
future.

An (almost) Unsolicited Testimony

What can I say about InterMail, other than that it's about the best
communication program I've ever used? -- And I've used them all. For
the last several months, I've been beta testing the now released
InterMail 2.0x. I can talk about it from a number of different
perspectives.

As a telecom professional, I'm delighted by the fact that InterMail
not only works as advertised, but has the first real, honest-to-
goodness MANUAL I've seen for a powerful communications package.
It's thorough, understandable, easy to use, and (all too scarce in
the computer world) well written.  In the world of Fido technology,
especially, manuals seem to be things written in afterthought,
preferably in Ancient Greek, translated into English by anyone who
happened to be standing around at the time. Some authors even brag
about their hatred for docs.

As a Sysop, I'm delighted that the program works.  If that seems a
strange thing to say, consider all the software you've tried that
"almost" works, or "mostly" works.  InterMail just... works. First
time, out of the package, it works.  Watched, unwatched, during
mail runs, outside of mail runs, in events and between events, it
works.  It is also truly tweak-resistant, which will be good news
to the many who can't resist trying *that* setting... oops!  And to
those whose mailers then spend hours trying to send to a system
that's down and out.

FidoNews 8-25                  Page 7                      24 Jun 1991


And it's not just the mailer:  the editor is a dream; the nodelist
manager (yay, nodelist manager!) is simple, elegant and complete --
no other program lets you pop into the routing and control files
and tweak them on the fly -- with ASCII editor and import/export
facilities; the terminal emulator is fast (scripts run at such
blazing speed I'm convinced Peter has snuck in a compiler without
telling anyone) and bug free.  Under DesqView, the program is so
well-behaved it seems to add clock speed to the CPU when it's
running - no more bleed through, jerky screen updates, or grinding
my teeth because my editor only runs at half speed with the mailer
up in the background.

As a computer professional, enthusiast, and long-time "power user"
(hate that term), I enjoy software that's bug free.  I beta test
many types of programs, and I do know how to stress-test a package
to see where it will break.  InterMail doesn't break.  In the years
I've been a beta tester I have never seen a more boring program to
test: it doesn't even crack at the seams a little.  Oh, there were
a few nit-picky items here and there that were fixed almost before
the netmail reply reached me, but as of the release date, bang on
it any way you like, the program has no known bugs. (Read my bits:
"No known bugs.")

As a user, I'm in love with the editor, which is such a pleasure to
use.  It's unobtrusive, so I don't get distracted by bells and
whistles, but it has depth and power enough that I have never been
unable to set up a message just the way I wanted it.  (Don't get me
wrong -- I like bells and whistles as much as the next guy, but not
when I'm trying to answer mail.) Like the rest of the program, it
runs like a jackrabbit - fast.

As all of the above, and above all, I'm thrilled by the tech
support:  Netmail a question (it doesn't seem to matter what time
of the day or night), and the reply comes back speedily. Peter
Stewart has help from his fiance and partner, Michele Hamilton.
They've answered the dumbest and the most pointed questions I could
throw at them, always with patience, wit, and interest.  How can
you ask for more than that? As one who has endured some of the
worst, and enjoyed much of the best tech support out there, I know
a good thing when I see it, and if InterMail had nothing else going
for it I would still use it just to have that support line.

There are few programmers who produce consistently reliable code.
Fewer still who can then document it for users.  Fewest of all who
can then support the user and still find time to turn out more and
more stuff and document that, too. Peter is one.

InterMail is a magnificent piece of work by any standards.  From a
Fido perspective, it's thoroughly professional; utterly unique.

(Okay, Peter, you can stop blushing now.  Come out from under the
desk...)

Preface:  The purpose of my writings here is not to necessarily
"convert" or hassle anyone who is content in their current
lifestyle or religion;  but rather, to show what the real Biblical
criteria for Christianity is, and thereby expose those who are
conning others.  Whether they are conning people financially,
socially, or on the FidoNet echos that allow religious discussion;
false preachers and false Christians are doing great harm to their
fellow man.
Just a basic elementary Bible knowledge could keep current and
future "Jim & Tammy" types from conning anyone on or off of
FidoNet or other Network.
(J & T weren't even teaching the real Bible message, EVER).

               Christ in you (the Power)

Jesus told His apostles and disciples to WAIT for POWER that
they did not yet have (even though they had been with Jesus as
His disciples and Apostles).

Luke 24:49  And, behold, I send the promise of my Father
upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye
be endued with power from on high.

Acts 1:8 But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy
Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me
both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and
unto the uttermost part of the earth.

When they received the POWER they ALL spoke in tongues.

Acts 2:4 And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and
began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them
utterance.

Speaking in tongues is the sign of a true believer, and is
repeatedly referred to in the Bible as the evidence that
the apostles accepted that a person had been "born again"
of the Spirit. (remember John 3:5)

Mark 16:17 And these signs shall follow them that believe;
In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak
with new tongues;
FidoNews 8-25                  Page 9                      24 Jun 1991


The Bible predicted that many would prefer false preachers
instead of wanting the truth, this also explains the
popularity of anti-Biblical teachings in FidoNet echos that
"claim" to be "Bible" oriented.

II Timothy 4:3 For the time will come when they will not
endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they
heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;

The Bible also warned that there would be those that would
have the form (church services, appearing "good", etc.), but
deny "tongues" (denying the POWER).

II Timothy 3:5 Having a form of godliness, but denying the
power thereof: from such turn away.

The Bible teaches that those who don't have the real Spirit
of Christ (POWER), are "none of His".

Romans 8:9 But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if
so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man
have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.

Jesus declaring HIMSELF to be the Spirit of Truth (the
Holy Ghost, the  "Power"). Please look carefully.

John 14:17  [Even] the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot
receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but
ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.

The Spirit of Truth (the Holy Ghost) is the form that
Jesus is manifesting Himself in, in this dispensation. Those
that deny tongues, deny Christ. They are only holding to the
form of religion, but they don't have the real thing, they
don't have the "POWER".

When someone rejects the Holy Ghost speaking in tongues;
they are rejecting Jesus Christ.

Draft FidoNet Election Policy                Revision: 21-Jun-91
Luke Kolin, 1:250/714@fidonet.org

 As a recognition that FidoNet is based on democratic principles, the
positions of the NC and RC shall be made elective. The following is
an election policy that intends to fulfill the democratic intent of
FidoNet.

FidoNews 8-25                  Page 10                     24 Jun 1991


1) Glossary of Terms

"Close of the      The time when the ballots are counted. No ballots
 Election"         will be accepted after this date/time.

"Elected Officer"  Any elected NC or RC.

"Immediate         The administrator one level higher in the FidoNet
 Superior"         hierarchy. For example, an NC's immediate superior
                   would be the RC, a ZC's would be the IC.

"Returning System" The equivelant of Chief Electoral Officer. It is
                   the sysop of this system who will post notices
                   advising eligible sysops as to who is running and
                   the close of the election, will count the ballots
                   and announce a winner.

"Semi-Secret       This is a ballot where a voter's choice is known
      Ballot"      only by the returning system, and by any routing
                   systems that the returning officer may designate.
                   A voter sends his ballot in with a password. At
                   the close of the election, the returning system
                   will post a list of passwords and the votes asso-
                   ciated with them. Voters may then check to see
                   that their password and votes have been received.

2) Calling of an Election

a) An election for a position shall be required by notice of one of
   the following events being given:

       i) Resignation of an elected officer;
      ii) An elected officer seeking a renewed mandate.

b) An elected officer who has resigned may appoint another sysop to
   act in his stead during the election; however, this interim
   officer must be ratified by the interim officer's immediate
   superior. He may act as a returning system, as outlined in
   sections 1c) and 1d).

c) Within three (3) days of this occurring, a formal call of election
must be given by the immediate superior of the position that shall
be voted upon, stating:

   i) The date of the election;
  ii) The name of the returning system.

d) An election must take place within thirty-two (32) days of the
   formal call of election, and every reasonable effort must be made
   to select a returning system acceptable to all.

FidoNews 8-25                  Page 11                     24 Jun 1991


3) Voter Eligibility

a) All sysops listed in the FidoNet nodelist as of twenty-one (21)
   full days before the close of the election are entitled to vote.

b) All sysops get one (1) vote only.

c) In network-specific elections, only sysops listed in that network
   and meeting requirement 2a) are entitled to vote.

4) Voter Notification

a) All elections shall be conducted via a semi-secret ballot. The
   identity of the voter shall be known only to the returning system.

b) The returning system must post a public message in the regional
   sysop EchoMail conference informing all systems of:

      i) The date of the vote;
     ii) The position being voted on;
    iii) The returning system's address;

   no less than thirty (30) days before the close of the election.

c) All eligible sysops will receive a netmail message from the
   returning system informing them of:

      i) The date/time ballots must be received by;
     ii) The position being voted on;
    iii) The candidates;
     iv) The returning system's address;
      v) Valid systems to route their ballot through.

   no less than ten (10) full days before the close of the election.
   After this message is sent out, ballots will be accepted by the
   returning system.

d) Systems unable to receive the message in 3c) will have a message
   of notification placed in the regional sysop EchoMail conference
   no less than seven (7) full days before the close of the election.

5) Candidate Eligibility

a) All candidates for the position being voted on must have been
   listed in the FidoNet nodelist as of twenty-one (21) days before
   the close of the election.

b) Candidates must register by sending a message of intent to the
   returning system's address no less than fourteen (14) full days
   before the close of the election.

FidoNews 8-25                  Page 12                     24 Jun 1991


c) All candidates have the right to post up to three (3) messages
   per week about their candidacy in the regional sysop EchoMail
   conference and the sysop EchoMail conference of each Net that
   has any eligible voters.

d) No one may prevent any candidate from posting an equal number of
   messages about their candidacy than another.

6) Voting Procedure, Election Results, and Enforcement

a) All ballots must be in by the closing date and time specified in
   all the notices given.

b) All ballots must have a sysop name, FidoNet address, and an
