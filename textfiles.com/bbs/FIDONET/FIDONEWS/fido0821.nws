     =================================================================
                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================


     This is my last Editorial.

     I have resigned as FidoNews Editor. We are currently working our
     way through a "short list" of replacement candidates, and the new
     Editor will be on the job next week.

     Be kind to the poor soul.

     I've just been looking though the indexes for the past two years.
     It's really amazing what we have been through. It's even more
     amazing that we are still here to talk about it.

     For example, when I took over Dale's job as Editor, the current
     version of FidoNet Policy was Version 3. David Dodell was the
     current International Coordinator. IFNA was still trying to
     figure out what, if anything, could be made of its existence.

     I was running my system on a DEC Rainbow. It worked great, too.
     A few other hardy souls were doing similar things on Sanyo and
     Tandy PC's (the ones from before Tandy became the PC-Clone hawker
     that they are today). Hardly anyone is doing THAT any more!

     POLICY4 was declared to be in force in FidoNews Volume 6, Number
     24, on June 12, 1989. This created a stir because in the absence
     of a formal procedure in POLICY3 for replacement, David used the
     method described in the POLICY4 draft to determine whether he
     should declare it to be in force. Boy, what a stir! There was
     that article in Volume 6, Number 26, entitled "Policy 4: FidoNet
     now a Nazi Dictatorship?". To the best of my knowledge nobody has
     been gassed or blitzed (except metaphorically) in the almost two
     years since.

     David quit at the end of July. I quit two weeks later, then
     changed my mind (with some coercion from friends). It was an
     exciting time to be the Editor. Because the Great IFNA Mandate
     Plebiscite was taking place.

     This was IFNA's final answer to the people who had claimed that
     the simple majority who chose IFNA were not representative. The
     voting rules were simple: if you were in the nodelist running a
     public access system, you were eligible. And a majority of all
     eligible nodes was required to endorse IFNA. If IFNA won the
     election, the critics would be silenced forever. And in a high
     stakes gamble, IFNA agreed to disband if not ratified.

     Did IFNA ever have a chance? Was it the right idea? Who really
     can say anymore? In any event, apathy won the election and IFNA
     was out, as reported in FidoNews Volume 7, Number 1.

     As I look back to 1989, what's really fascinating is that Pablo
     Kleinman was already at work on Worldpol in the immediate
     aftermath of the Policy4 adoption. And he's still at it. He is
     showing signs of getting it right, too. It's just going to take
     some more time.

     Remember Hurricane Hugo? Remember what it did to Mike Ratledge
     and many others in his area? FidoNet reached out and touched
     him in a very special way, and FidoNews was there, starting with
     an article in Volume 6, Number 39 entitled "Let's give Mike
     Ratledge a hand". One of our finest hours. I am proud to have
     been here to see it.

     FidoNews has had its critics too. There was an article in Volume
     6, Number 40 entitled "FidoNews: What IS Its Purpose ?". I have
     my own ideas about that. Fortunately for my peace of mind, it
     will soon be someone else's problem to define that role.

     When the Internetwork Gating Policy was published, there was a
     lot of comment. Mostly negative. I think (speaking as one of
     the people who had some input in the process) that if the
     criticism was directed at alternative solutions to the problems
     addressed in the Policy rather than direct attacks on the entire
     idea of HAVING such a document, we might have accomplished
     something. As things stand, the original document is still in
     force but not strongly enforced. In other words "If you want to
     connect to FidoNet, you could refer to this document and get it
     right -- or just do it any old way". Sigh. What happened to
     the idea of you don't go wee-wee in my garden and I won't go
     poo-poo in yours?

     We at FidoNews had a great moment in everyone's spotlight too.
     The way things were progressing, it was getting really hard to
     attract your attention anymore. But we found a way. On July 30,
     1990 lots of you woke up to find FidoNews sitting on your system
     in a file compressed with LHARC. Yup, you sure DID notice. I
     think it was probably the most popular topic in FidoNews that
     year. Even with the late start.

     It really pissed off Saddam Hussein too. In less than a week he
     had taken over Kuwait in an attempt to capture the responsible
     parties. After being told that the dirty deed had been done by
     an American, he is reported to have said "An American? OK. I'll
     wait here for him."

     I never made it over there. A lot of very brave folks did. And
     they did a great job. FidoNet was involved too, in its own unique
     way. An article in FidoNews Volume 7, Number 45 announced "The
     Saudi Connection". Numerous articles about the war were
     published. A healthy exchange of opinions ensued. People were
     engaged. It was great.

     FidoNews 8-21                Page 3                   27 May 1991


     We had ZC, RC and EC elections in Zone 1 and elsewhere, as the
     idea of democracy flowered in the Net. Then of course we had the
     great turnout in the Worldpol ratification vote. Electing NC's
     is an idea whose time has come. It should be easier to throw out
     the old slugs than it presently is.

     I sure wish I knew where FidoNet is going these days. The only
     consolation I have is that nobody knows. If anybody tells you
     that he or she DOES know, you can safely call that person a liar.

     Boy, there are some great memories here. And some not so great
     memories. It's been a lot of fun. But I won't miss it. I'll be
     too busy with other things.

     Well, maybe I will miss it. But I promise not to make a scene.

     Best regards,
     Vince

     Glen Johnson
     1:269/101@fidonet.org

                 The GATEWAY Complaint - the NC's side

     I'm  just  writing  this  little  blurb  to   clear   up   any
     misunderstanding about the "Gateway Complaint"  filed  by  Bob
     Moravsik,  and  finally  ruled   on   by   the   International
     Coordinator. First, a very brief summary of what  it  was  all
     about. This text is by Matt Whelan, in Fidonews 819:


     "In  essence,  Bob  complained  that  a  directive  from   his
     then-NC, Glen Johnson, contradicted  the  FidoNet<tm>  Gateway
     Document adopted by me last year."

     "The NC directive, to  his  hub  coordinators,  insisted  they
     pass on all mail for their nodes,  regardless  of  origin.  It
     also insisted  they  should  accept  calls  from  any  system,
     whether or not it was a FidoNet node."

     "Bob complained this forced the Hub Coords to act  as  Gateway
     systems under FidoNet policy. Thus they would be  required  to
     provide  outbound  gating  facilities  as  well,  despite  the
     technical complications this involved."

     "The decision at all levels was made  more  difficult  by  the
     complaint's somewhat unclear intent: was it a protest  at  the
     NC's imposition of a policy at all, or at the content  of  the
     policy?"


     Got it?


     Ok. As the person that drafted the HC policy  that  Bob  filed
     his complaint about, maybe I should explain what  that  policy
     was all about, and why I drafted it.

     My policy, which  was  a  directive  issued  to  all  the  hub
     coordinators in our net, was that they were to  accept  calls,
     and accept mail from wherever it came from, and forward it  to
     the addressee *IF* the addressee was a listed system in  their
     hub. This was to be done  regardless  of  the  origin  of  the
     message. I basically directed all the hub coordinators to  not
     give a hoot if the message came from a Fidonet system or  not,
     but to pay attention to whom  it  was  ADDRESSED.  I  did  not
     require hub coordinators to gate replies back. That's what the
     policy was all about.

     FidoNews 8-21                Page 5                   27 May 1991


     Bob  immediately   complained   that   this   modus   operandi
     contradicted the GATEPOL  document  that  was  dumped  on  the
     network by Matt Whelan. His complaint first went to RC13,  who
     rejected it, then to Z1C, who also  rejected  it.  It  finally
     went to Matt, and Fidonews 819 contains his decision.

     Now WHY did I invent this HC policy to  begin  with?  Well,  I
     actually didn't INVENT it. My  hub  coordinator's  policy  was
     merely a written document that  reflected  STANDARD  OPERATING
     PROCEDURE in Region 13. I had been told by RC13 that this  was
     how systems were to operate in Region 13.  Whether  or  not  I
     agree with that is irrelevant. I felt that if I were  required
     to operate my system as the net host in a particular  fashion,
     then all of the HCs under me are merely extensions of me,  and
     that they too, should be required to operate the same way.  So
     I  "put  it  in  writing"  and  shipped  it  off  to  the  hub
     coordinators.

     My HC policy in no way deviated  from  what  had  always  been
     the normal day to day method of operation  within  region  13,
     and it reflected my interpretation of how the RC wanted things
     done.

     Furthermore, I want it to be known that  the  complaint  filed
     about my HC policy was by no means an adversarial one. Bob and
     I BOTH were anxious to see it resolved, as we BOTH  wanted  to
     see the *C structure,  from  the  top  down,  speak  the  same
     language. Had my policy been overturned by the IC, that  would
     have been fine with me. I was much more interested  in  seeing
     that all the coordinators in  the  "chain  of  command"  knew,
     without any doubt, what the score was.

     In any case, since this issue came up, you  couldn't  possibly
     imagine the amount of juvenile mud slinging that has  gone  on
     about it. ALL of the parties involved have been acting like  a
     bunch of whining crybabies, but that's  a  story  for  another
     day. Its also not my problem :)

     On April 1, 1991 I retired as NC 269, and  I  appointed  (with
     the RC's approval) Mike Brandt, 1:269/201 to serve as  interim
     NC until the net coule democratically elect a  replacement.  I
     was elected NC twice, served two consecutive terms, and I felt
     that passing the torch would  give  someone  else  the  unique
     opportunity to experience first hand, all  of  the  nitpicking
     HORSESH*T that some NCs have to  deal  with.  Mike  wasn't  in
     "office" for a week before he found out about that BIG TIME.

     Personally, I find the GatePol document to be  repulsive.  But
     that's just my opinion. And  you  know  what  they  say  about
     opinions. But the most mind boggling thing  about  this  whole
     mess  (which  has  been  dragging  on  for  months,  and  just
     escalated to the boiling point a few weeks ago)  is  just  how
     crazy some people are when it comes to this stuff. Acting like
     Fidonet is something incredibly  IMPORTANT.  When  are  people
     going to use Fidonet for the purpose  it  was  INTENDED...  to
     ENHANCE your damn BBS, instead of trying to make an EMPIRE out
     FidoNews 8-21                Page 6                   27 May 1991


     of the thing and play lawyer, judge and jury like a  bunch  of
     three year olds watching LA LAW?

     So there you have  it.  My  policy,  the  complaint,  and  the
     decision. As far as I'M concerned, the case is closed. But I'm
     sure SOME people will find ways to beat it to a pulp and whine
     about it for months to come. Maybe its not so bad. It'll  keep
     'em off the streets.

                      A BETTER POLICY FOR FIDONET
                        (The Odyssey Continues)


     The recent vote on WorldPol version 1h is over. Results, as we
     have seen, were 39.5% in favour of adoption, 48.7% against
     adoption, and WorldPol version 1h was not adopted as a policy for
     FidoNet. But considering that only the coordinators can vote, I
     must admit that the figures were not disillusioning at all for
     those of us that promote WorldPol.

     Since the last known version of WorldPol was released last
     December, suggestions continued arriving, different points of
     view were exposed on FidoNews, and I got a few new ideas that I
     added to the document.

     The current FidoNet policy document, Policy4, is unquestionably
     impossible to enforce in a great portion of the world as well as
     opposed by a considerable number of the network's members. The
     debate created by the WorldPol election was effective in proving
     the fact that Policy4 MUST be changed.

     Support for WorldPol in Zone 4 was unanimous, in Zone 2 was 46 to
     12. There was also a great number of abstentions, primarily in
     North America where most of the coordinators did not participate
     in the referendum.

     A wise friend once told me: "if you are sure you are following
     the right path, keep on going". This is precisely what, God
     willing, I aim to do. I aspire to see improved outcome on this
     second occasion.

     This is a second opportunity not only for WorldPol, but for you
     that voted against it: participate so the next time you find it
     acceptable! When the second WorldPol referendum is held, no
     excuses will be accepted from those that deliberately decide not
     to participate. If someone is allowed to make a change and
     voluntarily rejects the opportunity, he shall have no right to
     complain later.

     A multi-zone echomail conference will be freely available to all
     those interested in participating in WorldPol 2. In the meantime,
     net-mail participation will be also welcome, as it has been since
     1989. Be sure to write as soon as possible to node 4:4/50 if you
     are interested in carrying the WorldPol echomail conference,
     which will be headquartered in Zone-1.

     Changes made to WorldPol with version 2: (a) different
     requirements for admittance to FidoNet and provisions for cases
     of discrimination; (b) adjustment in the roles of the ZCC and the
     IC; (c) definition of point systems and their rights; (d)
     FidoNews requirement modified; (e) election procedures described
     and elimination of "democratic by western standards". In addition
     to this, wording has been modified throughout the document, some
     grammar was corrected or changed.

     Here is the complete WorldPol 2:



                             W o r l d P o l
                  The FidoNet Worldwide Policy Document

                         Version 2, 23 May 1991


     This Worldwide Policy document has been released for vote by the
     members of FidoNet and is not yet in force.


     1 FidoNet

     This document establishes an international (inter-zonal) policy
     for sysops who are members of the FidoNet organization of
     bulletin board systems worldwide.  FidoNet is defined by a list
     of nodes (NodeList) issued on a weekly basis by each of the Zone
     Coordinators, on behalf of the International Coordinator.

     A node is understood to be a "member system" of FidoNet. The
     collection of nodes is classified into Zones, Regions and
     Networks.

     Each FidoNet Zone is entitled to issue its own policy document,
     according to its own needs and customs. This International
     Policy, determines general rules which must be specified -and may
     not be contradicted- by the Zone Policies.

     Regions and Networks may also issue their own policies according
     to the provisions stated on the corresponding Zone Policy.


     1.1 Overview

     FidoNet is an amateur electronic mail system. As such, all of its
     participants and operators are unpaid volunteers. From its early
     beginning in 1984, as a few friends swapping messages back and
     forth mainly in North America, it consists now of an
     International community of more than ten thousand systems all
     over the world.

     FidoNet is not a common carrier or a value-added service network
     and is a public network only as much as the independent,
     constituent nodes may individually provide public access to the
     network on their system.

     FidoNet exists to provide electronic mail services to its
     member sysops. To efficiently provide such services, various
     structure and control mechanisms are essential. The structure is
     organized into multiple nets, with decentralized administration.

     FidoNews 8-21                Page 9                   27 May 1991


     This document delineates all of the procedures at the
     international level of FidoNet, as well as some general rules for
     the lower levels (intra-zonal), developed to manage the network.

     Authorities in the international level not defined by this
     document, shall be defined by the Zone Coordinators Council and
     the International Coordinator.


     2 Language

     Each zone has the right to determine its own official language.

     At the international (inter-zonal) level, for practical purposes,
     FidoNet adopts English as its official language. All the FidoNet
     documents issued at the international level must exist in
     English. Translation into other languages is encouraged.


     3 Admittance to FidoNet

     FidoNet membership is open to everyone fulfilling the technical
     standards described on a document released by the network's
     Technical Standards Committee (FTS-0001 at this writing).
     Lower-level policies may issue additional restrictions only if
     specifically authorized by the Zone Coordinator Council.


     3.1 Anti-discrimination Policy

     Discrimination is strictly forbidden within FidoNet.
     This means that any type of restriction imposed to a member of
     the network that has no technical justification is illegal and
     unacceptable.

     No technical requisites will be demanded to any member of the
     network than those specifically authorized by this or lower-level
     policy documents.


     4 Organization

     The organizational structure of FidoNet, has been developed to
     distribute the administration and control of FidoNet, to the
     lowest possible level, while still allowing for coordinated
     action over the entire system.

     Effective administration is made viable by operating in a
     top-down manner. This means, that a person at any given level is
     responsible to the level above, and responsible for
     administrating the level below.

     FidoNews 8-21                Page 10                  27 May 1991


     If a person at any level above sysop is unable to properly
     perform their duties, the person at the next level may replace
     them.  For example, if a Region Coordinator fails to perform, the
     Zone Coordinator may cause the Coordinator to be replaced.

     Coordinators may also be removed by a majority vote of the level
     below. For example, if network Coordinators in a region lose
     faith in the ability of a Region Coordinator to effectively
     perform, they may vote to have a new Coordinator elected.


     4.1 Zone Coordinator Council

     The Zone Coordinator Council (ZCC) consists of the Zone
     Coordinators and the International Coordinator.

     Each Zone Coordinator has one vote at the ZCC. The International
     Coordinator may only vote in the event of a ZCC vote tie, but
     does not regularly have voting power.

     The Zone Coordinator Council is the legislative body of FidoNet,
     it represents each of the zones in FidoNet. It is the highest
     authority of the network's Top-Down organization.


     4.2 International Coordinator

     The International Coordinator (IC) is the Executive Officer of
     FidoNet and coordinates the joint production of the master
     nodelist by the Zone Coordinators. The International Coordinator
     is responsible for creating new zones in FidoNet, but can only do
     so with the approval of a simple majority of the members of the
     Zone Coordinator Council.

     The International Coordinator is selected by unanimous vote of
     the Zone Coordinators, and removed by a majority vote of the Zone
     Coordinators. In the case of absence of the International
     Coordinator, the Zone Coordinator Council replaces him by voting
     on all IC resolutions to be approved by a simple majority.


     4.3 Zones and Zone Coordinators

     A zone is a defined geographic area containing one or many
     regions, covering one or more countries.

     The Zone Coordinator is the Executive Officer of the Zone, and
     the zone's representative to the other zones.

     The Zone Coordinator compiles the nodelists from all of the
     regions in the zone, creates a master nodelist and a difference
     file, which is then distributed over FidoNet within the zone. A
     Zone Coordinator does not perform message-forwarding services for
     any nodes in the zone, whereas the Zone Coordinator is
     responsible for the formation and/or administration of one or
     more zone-gates to provide inter-zone mail facilities.
     FidoNews 8-21                Page 11                  27 May 1991


     The method used for selection of Zone coordinators is left to
     the  discretion of the relevant Zone Policy.  In the absence of a
     Zone Policy selection method, Zone Coordinators are elected and
     removed by a simple majority vote of the Region Coordinators in
     the Zone.


     4.4 Regions and Region Coordinators

     A Region is a defined geographic area containing nodes which
     may or may not be combined into networks. A typical Region will
     contain many nodes in networks, and a few independent nodes which
     are not part of the network.

     The Region Coordinator maintains the list of independent nodes in
     the region, and accepts nodelists from the Network Coordinators
     in the Region. These are compiled to create a regional nodelist,
     which is sent to the Zone Coordinator. A Region Coordinator is
     encouraged to perform message-forwarding services for nodes
     within the region, but is not forced to, unless the appropriate
     Zone or Region policy imposes such a requirement.

     The method used for selection of Regional coordinators is left to
     the discretion of the relevant Zone or Region Policy.  In the
     absence of such a policy selection method, Region Coordinators
     are elected and removed by a simple majority vote of the Ncs in
     the Region.


     4.5 Networks and Network Coordinators

     A network is a group of nodes, normally but not exclusively in a
     local geographic area. Networks coordinate their mail activity to
     decrease cost.

     The Network Coordinator is responsible for maintaining the list
     of nodes for the network, and for forwarding netmail sent to
     members of the network from other FidoNet nodes. The Network
     Coordinator may make arrangements to handle outgoing netmail, but
     is not required to do so, unless the appropriate Zone, Region or
     Net policy imposes such a requirement.

     The Network Coordinator is responsible for assigning each and
     every petitioner within his own geographic area, a valid node
     number within 10 days. A node application can solely be rejected
     on technical grounds and if that is the case, the petitioner and
     the rest of the local network must be informed by the NC of the
     requirements that will allow the node number to be assigned.

     The method used for selection of Network coordinators is left to
     the discretion of the relevant Zone/Region/Net Policy.  In the
     absence of such a policy selection method, Network Coordinators
     are elected and removed by a simple majority vote of the Nodes in
     the Network.

     FidoNews 8-21                Page 12                  27 May 1991


     4.5.1  Network Routing Hubs


     Network Routing Hubs exist only in some networks. They may be
     appointed by the Network Coordinator, in order to assist the
     management (especially routing tasks) of the network.


     4.6 Individual systems (Nodes)

     The smallest subdivision of FidoNet is the individual system,
     corresponding to a single entry in the nodelist. The system
     operator (SysOp) formulates a policy for running the board and
     dealing with the users. The sysop must mesh with the rest of the
     FidoNet system to receive and send mail, and the local policy
     must be consistent with other levels of FidoNet.


     4.6.1 Points

     A point is a system that is not in the nodelist, but communicates
     with FidoNet through a node defined to as bossnode.

     A point operator is generally regarded in the same manner as a
     node operator, but does not have right to vote and shares
     responsibility of his actions with his bossnode.

     The bossnode operator is responsible for all mail originating at
     the point. All mail sent to a point is addressed to the
     bossnode's address.

     A point operator is granted full rights under this policy
     document as an associate (co-sysop) of the bossnode operator
     listed on the nodelist.


     4.6.2 Users of an individual system

     The sysop is responsible for the actions of any user when they
     affect the rest of FidoNet (i.e. if the user is annoying, the
     sysop is annoying). The users have no rights under this policy
     document.


     4.7 The FidoNet Technical Standards Committee

     The FidoNet Technical Standards Committee, abbreviated as the
     FTSC, exists for the purpose of establishing minimum requirements
     in software and hardware to be able to interface with FidoNet.

     These minimum requirements must be obeyed at every level.  Nodes
     not meeting these requirements are ineligible for a node number
     (see section 5.9).  These requirements are subject to change at
     any time by the FTSC.

     FidoNews 8-21                Page 13                  27 May 1991


     5 General Procedures for All Coordinators


     5.1 Making Available Difference Files and Nodelist

     Each Coordinator is responsible for obtaining and making
     available for file request, on a weekly basis, nodelist
     difference files and complete nodelists.


     5.2 Making Available FidoNews Documents

     FidoNews is the Official Newsletter of FidoNet.  Each
     Coordinator is responsible for obtaining and making available
     for file request on a weekly basis, FidoNews Documents.

     This requirement may be waived in the event that a majority of
     the Sysops served by the Coordinator have no desire to read or
     receive FidoNews.

     If a Zone Coordinator is not able to get FidoNews into his Zone,
     he should immediately request help to the FidoNews Editor. If the
     Editor can arrange a way to have it delivered to the Zone
     Coordinator, FidoNews must be necessarily available to the rest
     of the Zone. Otherwise, the Zone Coordinator may unilaterally
     waive this requirement.


     5.3 Processing Nodelist Changes and Passing Them Upstream

     Each Coordinator is responsible for obtaining nodelist
     information from the level below, processing it, and passing the
     results to the level above.  The timing of this process is
     determined by the requirements imposed by the level above.


     5.4 Ensure the Latest Policy is Available

     A Coordinator is responsible to make the current version of the
     International Policy available to the level below, and to
     encourage familiarity with it.


     5.5 Minimize the Number of Hats Worn

     Coordinators are persuaded to limit the number of FidoNet-related
     Coordinator functions they perform. A Coordinator who holds two
     different positions, compromises the appeal process. For example,
     is the Network Coordinator is also the Region Coordinator, sysops
     in that network are denied one level of appeal.

     FidoNews 8-21                Page 14                  27 May 1991


     Multiple hats are also discouraged due to the difficulty of
     replacing services when a coordinator leaves the net.


     5.6 Be a Member of the Area Administered

     A Coordinator must be a member of the area administered. This is,
     a Network Coordinator must be a member of the network he is to
     coordinate. A Region Coordinator must be either a member of a
     network in the region, or an independent in a region.


     5.7 Encourage New Sysops to Enter FidoNet

     A Coordinator is encouraged to operate a public bulletin board
     system which is freely available for the purpose of distributing
     Policy and Nodelists to potential new sysops. Dissemination of
     this information to persons who are potential FidoNet sysops is
     important to the growth of FidoNet, and Coordinators should
     encourage development of new systems.


     5.8 Tradition, Precedent and Technical Management

     A Coordinator is not bound by the practices of predecessor.
     However, it must be clear that Coordinators are bound by all
     requirements of this document, both as FidoNet sysops and as
     Coordinators. The holding of a Coordinator title does not grant
     license to annoy others or to flaunt policy.

     The primary responsibility of any Coordinator is technical
     management of network operations. Decisions MUST be made only
     on technical grounds. A Coordinator has the responsibility to act
     as objectively as possible; objectivity must be considered an
     essential factor when making a decision.


     5.9 Exclusivity of Zone Mail Hour

     Zone Mail Hour is the heart of FidoNet, as this is when network
     mail is passed between systems.  Any system which wishes to be a
     part of FidoNet must be able to receive mail during this time
     using the protocol defined in the current FidoNet Technical
     Standards Committee publication (FTS-0001 at this writing).  It
     is permissible to have greater capability (for example, to
     support additional protocols or extended mail hours), but the
     minimum requirement is FTS-0001 capability during this one hour
     of the day.

     This time is exclusively reserved for netmail.  Many phone
     systems charge on a per-call basis, regardless of whether a
     connect, no connect, or busy signal is encountered.  For this
     reason, any activity other than normal network mail processing
     that ties up a system during ZMH is considered annoying behavior.
     User (BBS) access to a system is prohibited during ZMH.

     FidoNews 8-21                Page 15                  27 May 1991


     Zone Mail Hour will be defined by each Zone Policy. In the
     absence of a Zone Policy, it will be defined by the Zone
     Coordinator.


     6 Election and Referendum Procedures

     Any election or referendum at any level of FidoNet, must comply
     with the standards described in this chapter.


     6.1 Democratic Qualities of the Election

     All sysops in FidoNet have a vote and must be allowed to
     participate in an election or referendum.

     All sysops in FidoNet are entitled to be candidates to any
     elective position, provided that the requirements for each
     position described on this and lower-level policy documents are
     satisfied.


     6.2 Particular election mechanisms

     Each zone will issue its own election procedures, which may
     involve direct participation or indirect participation (electoral
     college approach).

     In any case, all the sysops in the zone must be allowed to vote.
     In the case of an indirect elections, the electors must be chosen
     by direct vote of the sysops.


     6.2.1 Coordinators acting as Electors

     Coordinators will automatically be qualified as electors
     representing their network or region in an indirect election only
     if they have been chosen by direct vote of the sysops in the
     administered area.


     6.4 Worldwide elections and referendums

     In worldwide elections and referendums with the participation of
     all zones, the Zone Coordinator Council will determine the
     election procedures and whether vote will be direct or indirect.
     This will be done in each particular case by form of a ZCC
     resolution.


     7 Policy Referenda

     FidoNews 8-21                Page 16                  27 May 1991


     7.1 International Policy

     A referendum on International Policy modification is invoked by
     the International Coordinator at the direction of a majority of
     the Zone Coordinators, or a majority of the Region Coordinators
     of all zones, a majority of the Network Coordinators of all
     zones, or by one third of all the sysops in all zones.

     All the members of FidoNet are entitled to vote on an
     International Policy referendum, which is to be held according to
     the procedures described by the Zone Coordinator Council before
     the election is called.


     7.2 Zone Policy

     A referendum on Zone Policy modification is invoked by the Zone
     Coordinator, by a majority vote of the Region Coordinators in the
     zone, by a majority vote of the Network Coordinators in the
     zone, or by one third of all the sysops in the zone.

     All the members of the zone are entitled to vote on a Zone
     Policy referendum, which is to be held according to the
     procedures described on the Zone Policy. If such document does
     not exist, the procedures will be determined by the Zone
     Coordinator with the approval of the Zone Coordinator Council.

     The formulation of Region and Network Policy documents is
     encouraged, and must be regulated by the Zone Policy documents in
     each zone.


     7.3 Transition to a 'Worldwide Policy environment'

     After the approval of this Worldwide Policy, the previously
     existing policy will still be in effect for the Zone level until
     the approval of a new Zone policy, according to the methods
     provided in this document.

     All the procedures introduced by this Worldwide Policy document
     adjourn the procedures existing in the previous policy document.


     8 Resolution of Disputes

     The FidoNet judicial philosophy can be summed up in two rules:

            1) Thou shalt not excessively annoy others.

            2) Thou shalt not become excessively annoyed.

     FidoNews 8-21                Page 17                  27 May 1991


     The parties involved in a dispute are encouraged to solve their
     problems directly, without the intervention of a Coordinator.


     8.1 Mediation Requests

     Any of the parties involved may request the intervention of the
     respective Coordinator: Network Coordinator if a dispute between
     members of the same network, Region Coordinator if a dispute
     between members of different networks on the same region; Zone
     Coordinator if a dispute between members of different regions on
     the same zone; International Coordinator if a dispute between
     members of different zones.

     The Coordinator requested as "mediator", will ask each party to
     provide all the information before two weeks from the request and
     will make a decision within forty-five days after he received all
     the information from the involved parties.

     A Coordinator, unable to resolve a dispute, may name a third
     party to act as "mediator", provided the parties involved in the
     dispute agree.


     8.2 Appealing to a Mediator's Decision

     A mediator's decision may be appealed to the immediately superior
     level if considered unfair: Region Coordinators handle appeals
     from decisions made by Network Coordinators;  Zone Coordinators
     handle appeals from decision made by Region Coordinators; The
     International Coordinator handles appeals from decisions made by
     the Zone Coordinators; and the Zone Coordinator Council will
     handle appeals from decisions made by the International
     Coordinator,  being the Zone Coordinator Council's resolutions,
     unappealable.

     For appealing to a decision made by a third person named by a
     Coordinator to act as mediator, it will be as if the Coordinator
     made the resolution and the previously enumerated sequence of
     appealing will be appropriate.

     For appealing to a decision made by a mediator, the same terms
     and procedures as for any Mediation Request apply.


     8.3 Statute of Limitations

     A mediation request may not be filed more than 60 days after the
     date of discovery of the source of the infraction, either by
     admission or technical discovery of the source of an infraction,
     either by admission or technical evidence. Mediation requests may
     not be filed more than 120 days after the incident, unless they
     involve suspected unlawful behavior, in which the legal statute
     of limitations of the country involved shall apply.

     8.4 Echomail and File Distribution Networks

     Each FidoNet Zone is encouraged to establish in it's Zone
     Policy, the manner of handling Echomail and File Distribution,
     and the resolution of disputes arising from both distributions.

     No sysop may be required to carry an echomail conference or a
     File Distribution a as a condition of joining or remaining in
     FidoNet.

     Don Benson
     Tribute Test Point 1:157/603

                     Why do we need a WorldPol?

     I have read with interest the debate in Fidonews since the
     publication of WorldPol.  The arguments fly back and forth, and
     both sides seem set in their decisions, yet one issue that I
     think is important has yet to come up.  Do we need an
     international "Policy" like WorldPol or Policy4?

     Fidonet has grown to encompass most of the world.  In doing so,
     it has absorbed people and technologies from many cultural and
     technological backgrounds.  To ask for one policy document which
     will satisfy all is an insurmountable task.  Yet this is what is
     being attempted in WorldPol.

     There are only two directions to move with such a document,
     either toward anarchy or dictatorship.  Some people complain that
     Policy 4 was too much like a dictatorship.  The opposite side
     claims the proposed WorldPol is too vague, and will promote
     anarchy.  A prime example of this is the debate over "western
     democratic standards."  If left in its vague form, it would
     prmote anarchy as people interpreted it as they liked.  However,
     changing the language to specific operational procedures would be
     forcing some people to adopt methods which aren't ideal for them.

     The crux of the situation seems to be that WorldPol tries to do
     too much.  Policy 4 had the same problem as Zones 2 through 6
     developed and flourished.  What needs to be done is to simply
     throw out anything that is not necessary on an international
     level.

     For example, the issue of geographical nets comes to mind.  What
     difference does it make to Joe Sysop in Anytown, USA if Jurgen
     Sysop in Jeneburg, Germany is not in a geographical net?
     Especially when sending netmail?  This is something that should
     be decided on the zone or even regional level, not
     internationally.

     Concerning elections, perhaps WorldPol should only decree how the
     IC is elected.  It should have no say or take any position on how
     any other *C's are elected.  This still leaves room for debate,
     since the specific method of an IC election will never please
     everyone.  However, it also doesn't place any weight on elections
     at lower levels.

     The trickiest area I see in defining a WordPol is handling
     international disputes.  In fact, this should be the main body of
     WorldPol, and have the most meaning.  Everything else should only
     be minimal procedural definitions for the sake of structure, which
     is necessary to keep the organization together.

     One final point for anybody who is or wants to have an input on
     WorldPol.  I never knew one was being developed (mostly because I
     am a fairly new Fidonet node) until I saw it in the Snooze.  For
     those who are sending in suggestions, how about this one: Try to
     make any Policy reflect how things are actually working.

     In sum, I think that WorldPol could probably be reduced to a
     third of the current size, and we would end up with a smaller,
     more effective document.  Take a few moments and look at WorldPol
     again.  Ask yourself if each section is absolutely necessary to
     be controlled at the international level?  If not, why include
     it?

     Zone 1 Coordinators on Notice
     George Peace
     1:1/0

     I expect each Network and Region Coordinator in Zone 1 to review
     section 8 of FidoNet Policy. I'll do the same. In particular,
     the second paragraph of 8.3 is critical...

      "Network coordinators are expected to assess the opinions of
       members of their network, and to vote accordingly..."

     The word "expected" does not mean "hope" or "if you have time".
     It means EXPECTED. As in REQUIRED, as interpreted here in
     FidoNet Zone 1. Coordinator excuses for failure to read FidoNews
     or the NodeDiff comments and failure to cast a vote in a Policy
     referendum are sad and embarassing. The Zone 1 Region
     Coordinators are on notice that each of them is EXPECTED to
     issue appropriate notices to Network Coordinators in their
     respective regions. And EXPECTED to follow up to assure that
     excuses of ignorance or apathy are not substituted for duty to
     represent the SysOps of FidoNet.

     My thanks to Don Dawson, R16C, and the NCs and SysOps of Region
     16 for their 100% turnout in the recent WorldPol referendum. They
     proved it could be done in one Region. Let's ALL show them it can
     be done in 9 more Zone 1 regions.

        Thanks for listening and helping
        George Peace, Z1C

     1:154/8 Fidonet

            Response to Henry Clark's Comments on "Joggraphy"

          In Fidonews 8-20 Henry Clark made the following comments:

          "All you folks who live for echomail will soon conclude
     that I'm crazy as Emily but I'm telling everyone anyway.
     Electronic mail is on the whole, a fine way to communicate with
     someone you know, but echomail and other public access
     'everybody sees everybody else' type forums is not social
     interaction.  It's like having everybody watch TV and calling
     that our educational system.  Nothing is going to replace
     direct face to face contact.

          "And that's why I think Geography is important to Fidonet.
     Geographic boundaries, and particularly NETS, align folks into
     groups which are physically close to each other, and best able
     to get together.  In my net, we have a monthly Pizza Party.  In
     our Region, we have a yearly Lake Party.  You probably have
     these kinds of meetings in your parts of the world.  That's the
     really good part."

          Henry makes some good points, but I think he is losing
     sight of the forest for the trees here.  In the first place
     "close to each other" is a relative concept.

          For example, I live in Region 11.  If you measure the
     distance between one side of the region and the other, you find
     that the distance in some places (e.g. northwest Wisconsin to
     southeast Kentucky) is approximately a thousand miles.  Even if
     you could have a gathering in the exact center of this area, it
     would still mean a 500 mile trip for some folks.  Those of you
     who jet to Europe for vacations may think of this as nothing,
     but 500 miles is a considerable distance for some folks to
     travel.

          This difference in perception of distance and ease of
     travel is what causes a lot of the conflicts in Fidonet.  For
     example, a couple of years ago there were some folks who were
     quite seriously stating that any sysop that did not attend
     Fidocon did not really care about Fidonet (and, by implication,
     had no right to comment on anything taking place in Fidonet).
     Presumably the people making such comments could afford to jet
     about the country, but many sysops (not just the younger ones,
     either) put together systems on a shoestring to try and tap
     into this wonderful information source that we have and can't
     afford to just pick up and travel halfway across the country or
     further to participate in a hobby.

     FidoNews 8-21                Page 24                  27 May 1991


          The other difference in perception is between those who
     live in major metropolitan areas and those who do not.  If you
     live in a city where there are 100 Fidonet nodes, and probably
     three or four alternate Fidonet technology networks
     represented, you probably don't have to worry too much about
     the cost of getting echomail.  I only wish that some of these
     folks who are so hung up on geography had to go live for a
     couple of years in a place where you were required by policy
     and politics to get your echomail feeds from an in-state feed
     200 miles away, at your expense, while knowing that there is an
     interstate feed only 20 miles away but because it's in another
     region, you're not allowed to belong there, or get your echoes
     there.

          You see, Henry, you're thinking only in terms of clusters
     of sysops in cities, without giving any consideration to sysops
     in rural areas that are often told "where to go" in Fidonet
     without any consideration at all being given to the notion that
     they might wish to pick up echoes from the least costly source.

          Now, I do have to admit that I also differ with you on the
     notion that a sysop should be forced to belong to a particular
     net that's in his local area, even if he can get free echomail
     there for only the price of a local call, because I believe in
     the principle of freedom of association.  Simply put, in an
     organization such as Fidonet, I see no good reason why a sysop
     should be FORCED to be part of a particular net if they don't
     want to.  I also can't imagine why a net would want to force a
     sysop to join their net if he doesn't want to, since this only
     invites future conflicts.

          Let's put one notion to rest:  If the IC declared tomorrow
     that geography was no longer a consideration in Fidonet, and
     that any node could join any net they please, 98% of the nodes
     would probably stay right where they are.  Another 1.9 percent
     might switch nets because it is less costly for them to get
     echoes from the net they join... for the most part, these would
     likely be nodes located near a region or net boundary.  In my
     opinion, switching nets to save money on toll calls makes a lot
     of sense, but there are a few in Fidonet (who, obviously, are
     NOT in that type of situation) who can't see that.  Finally,
     MAYBE 0.1 percent would switch nets for political reasons, or
     because of personality conflicts... so what?  Suddenly someone
     who was not happy (and who perhaps was flooding the echoes with
     messages telling everyone why they were not happy) is now happy
     and content... why should that bother anyone, except maybe some
     power-hungry idiot who somehow takes it personally whenever a
     node leaves his fold (did Jim Jones get reincarnated as a
     *C?!).

          Then there are the folks who say that if you allow
     special-interest nets in Fidonet, you'll have them formed along
     racist lines or some such malarky.  Well, if that's your REAL
     worry and not just a "red herring", the put something in Policy
     that says that no special interest nets may be formed that
     promote racial hatred, etc.  Simple.  As it is, such groups
     FidoNews 8-21                Page 25                  27 May 1991


     could be formed in "other" nets or in a private net, so you're
     not really stopping such a thing from happening, you're just
     driving it underground where it's less detectable, like
     termites in the woodwork.  My personal opinion is that "special
     interest nets" would not last long anyway due to the costs
     involved... the only special interest nets that would make any
     sense would be for those few who live in places where it would
     be cheaper to pick up echomail via PC Pursuit rather than
     through the nearest local net.  Remember, there are still
     good-sized cities that have access to packet switching networks
     but where there are either no Fidonet nodes, or only a lone
     node or two.

          Let me give you but one real life example.  Ever heard of
     Duluth, Minnesota?  What you may not know is that there are
     actually two cities in the Duluth metropolitan area: Duluth and
     Superior, Wisconsin.  These two are a local call from each
     other, and there is access to packet switching nodes in Duluth.
     However, according to the nodelist there are NO Fidonet nodes
     in that area at present.  But Minnesota is in Region 14, while
     Wisconsin is in Region 11.  If a net ever formed in that area,
     which region would it be in?  Or would the Duluth nodes have to
     call long distance to get their echoes from a source in Region
     14, while the Superior nodes have to call to get the same
     echoes from a Region 11 source?  And would nodes in the two
     cities be forever barred from holding pizza parties together
     because they are in different regions, or would they be
     permitted to do it only after "special dispensation" from the
     ZC ant the two RC's involved?  You're probably thinking that
     I'm being totally ridiculous here and I AM... but only to prove
     my point, which is that drawing artificial boundaries based on
     geography IS ridiculous in an electronic mail network.  The
     people who live near these artificial boundaries, and
     especially those who don't live in major cities are fully aware
     of how stupid this is, but those who live nearer the center of
     a region (or in an area NOT bordering another region, such as
     near an ocean) don't really appreciate the hardship that these
     artificial boundaries can cause for some.

          Henry, my point is that in places where it makes sense for
     sysops to group together because of geographic boundaries or
     telephone exchange boundaries, they will continue to do so even
     if we DON'T mandate it.  Where it DOESN'T make sense for them
     to group together, it is WRONG for others to demand that they
     do so... particularly when those others would not be adversely
     affected in any way if those few who would really benefit from
     the freedom to change nets were given it.

          Please keep in mind that Fidonet (or at least Fidonet
     technology) is somewhat unique in that it may be the ONLY
     cost-effective means of electronic communications for those
     that live in rural areas.  Think about it a minute... if
     Fidonet disappeared tomorrow, those who live in the cities
     where packet switching nodes are accessible would probably sign
     up for GEnie (or, if they were truly desperate, Prodigy), or
     perhaps try to find a local link into UseNet.  Most folks in
     FidoNews 8-21                Page 26                  27 May 1991


     rural areas simply don't have those options available (at least
     not at anything approaching a reasonable cost), since in the
     United States the packet networks have been alllowed to "cherry
     pick" the larger cities and ignore the rural areas.  And folks
     who live in rural areas and who may be forced to spend more
     money than they would otherwise have to in order to pick up
     echoes, just because of some political lines that have been
     drawn by city folks, probably have a whole different
     perspective on this problem than you do.

          Finally, if you're going to argue that face to face
     contact between sysops is desirable and important, then to be
     consistent you should at least be arguing for more, smaller
     regions.  Regions that cover a 1000 or 2000 mile radius are
     just too large.  Look at the size of Region 17 (Alaska, British
     Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Washington, Oregon,
     Idaho, Montana, and Hawaii)... can you stand there with a
     straight face and tell me that a good percentage of the sysops
     from that region would show up at a regional get-together,
     regardless of where in the region it might be held?  I'm sorry,
     Henry, but while I agree that face to face contact between
     sysops is a good idea, I don't think that you need to enforce
     regional boundaries to achieve that goal.  Why not just throw
     parties in various parts of the country and say that they're
     open to all Fidonet sysops that can make it there?  Why put a
     regional restriction on the gatherings at all?

          I still contend that geographic restrictions in Fidonet
     DON'T MAKE SENSE, that they were first enforced for political
     reasons and now mostly due to inertia and fear of change, but
     they have never made sense and never will.

                     A Cautionary Tale

     by Charles Herriot (1:163/110)


     In was a bright sunny day in Washington,D.C, as Jim
     "Billy-Bob" St. Packer strode up the steps of the Supreme
     Court building. Following closely on his heels, was Waldo
     Tosser. These esteemed lawyers were arriving for what was
     judged by the media to be a clash of titans. Almost
     forgotten in the media glare were the names of the plaintiff
     and the defendant in the action which was finally to be
     resolved before the justices. More completely forgotten was
     the issue upon which the original litigants had disagreed.

     Moving up the steps, in waves like sharks at a
     slaughterhouse effluent pipe, were legions of other lawyers.
     The pin-striped legions represented an incredible diversity
     of interests who had all successfully petitioned the court
     for the right to be heard. In no particular order, lawyers
     representing all the major telecommunications companies, the
     major commercial bulletin board systems, several large
     software houses, the FCC, the FBI, the NSA, the Teamsters,
     my ex-wife's divorce lawyer, and a scattering of religious
     organizations whose presence was inexplicable.

     One media pundit, after being asked for the hundredth time
     by Dan Rather: "So, what's the mood of the people down there
     on the sidewalk?" had noted that there was at *least* seven
     hundred thousand dollars per hour of billable time oozing up
     the steps. The defendant looked out of place as he emerged
     from a taxi and brushed the lint from his plastic pocket pen
     protector. The plaintiff adjusted the wad of black
     electrical tape which held his glasses together and
     staggered up the steps under the weight of his "laptop".

     Anyone who misunderstood how these processes took on their
     own compelling momentum might have been bemused by the
     nature of the original complaint. It was an issue of genuine
     triviality, an issue so ludicrous and picayune that no
     reasonable nor sane person would ever have dreamt that it
     would gather a vast hornet's swarm of legal devotees and
     become a potential landmark decision. It had started as a
     FidoNet policy complaint. In fact, it had started over the
     fact that the defendant had failed to insert *exactly* one
     space after the word "Origin" in his BBS mailer software.

     That one misplaced space had already resulted in a cost of
     four hundred thousand dollars worth of billable time to be
     generated by the bovine herd of lawyers as they traversed
     the steps of the court building. Another million dollars
     worth of billable time would have elapsed before the Chief
     Justice banged the gavel to commence proceedings. The costs
     to the various interlocutors in preparing the case would
     have paid off the national debt of most third world
     countries.
     FidoNews 8-21                Page 28                  27 May 1991


     The plaintiff, being ever-mindful of the *need* to ensure
     that FidoNet policy was followed as closely as the
     decolletage on a Miss America Beauty Queen aspirant, had
     complained about the extra space inserted by the defendant's
     mailer. As luck would have it, the NC of their net, A. Nal
     Retentive, saw the issue as akin to motherhood, good
     government and the preservation of innocent children
     everywhere. He unloaded both barrels at the hapless
     defendant, upheld the policy complaint and banished the
     defendant from FidoNet. The defendant's entire reason for
     living was centered on his BBS. The decision caused the
     gelatin in his spine to harden into something that passed
     for resolve among serious technodweebs. In a stirring
     declaration of outrage he muttered "Well heck, this just
     ain't right".

     Quicker than you can say "Please pass me that piano", the
     defendant had launched an appeal to the RC. Ill fortune
     plagued this issue because the RC had staggered into his den
     after a night of serious power-drinking to discover the
     message containing the plaintive bleatings of the appellant.
     The RC savagely threw himself (and part of his lunch) into
     the reply message which not only denied the appeal, but
     further sentenced the appellant to a week in Chicago.


     Disheartened, the defendant soldiered on, opening yet
     another multi-tasking window and cranked out an appeal
     destined for the ZC. Seven months later... when the ZC
     finally read his netmail, the issue seemed to be a clear
     violation of a new Echomail policy which the *EC structure
     had recently posted as the new, improved, revealed word of
     God, Herself. The ZC had no desire to trifle with the
     religious state-within-a-state which had grown up around the
     *EC structure (and besides, they'd promised to let him wear
     one of those hats with the really neat sheep horns if he
     turned a blind eye to their ravening efforts at
     Intergalactic domination). The ZC denied the appeal, and
     added an even more cruel and inhumane punishment... the
     defendant was further sentenced to memorizing all the FTSC
     specifications.

     The defendant, in one of those rare moments of insight which
     change the world, muttered "Golly, this sure ain't gettin'
     no better. I got rights just like everyone else." Now, it
     has been suggested that merely whispering the word "rights"
     will cause an infestation of lawyers to congregate like
     moths at a bug-zapper, and this exclamation of the word was
     no exception. Faster than the defendant could say "Yep, I
     reckon I could get another mortgage on the house and sign
     over my firstborn", a small pack of lawyers were filing what
     was to become an avalanche of legal mayhem. The plaintiff,
     having had his door wallpapered with enough summons,
     requests to attend discoveries, show cause notices, and
     other legal blackmail, engaged his own lawyer.

     FidoNews 8-21                Page 29                  27 May 1991


     After seventy three delays, rescheduled hearings, and
     improper service of motion hearings, both the judge and the
     two lawyers had one of those rare simultaneous moments when
     their connections had failed to deliver their daily intake
     of cocaine, in short; they were all lucid and able to
     proceed with the matter. The judge, after noting that the
     double-knit trousers of the defendant made him look like the
     kind of geek who would vote Democrat, rendered a decision
     which was incomprehensible but gave no joy to the defendant.

     The appeal hearing might have gone unnoticed and the matter
     might have died had another quirk of fate not intervened.
     The court stenographer was renowned for the brevity of her
     skirts, and thus the court was always well attended by the
     lascivious, but generally esteemed big guns of the law
     cartel. In hopes of having to "further review the
     transcript", one lawyer generously offered to take the
     appeal to the Divisional court level. This lawyer, noted
     neither for brains nor his knowledge of the law, was a
     master at media relations. Between commercials on the
     evening news the world soon learned that this was not
     *simply* an issue between two hapless sysops... no indeed,
     this was an issue involving the First Amendment Right to be
     a real moron. It was an issue that would change the very
     fabric of telecommunications, keep the world safe from
     democracy, and provide a framework for some new and dubious
     military adventurism on the part of The President.

     The NRA, in their usual bone-headed fashion, issued a press
     release that said: "Computers don't start NukeMail, people
     do." The telecommunication giants waded into the fray with
     their own pricey advertisements paid for by a special per
     call levy charged against BBS systems. The Greenpeacers and
     all the others in the "I brake for whales" crowd expressed
     their outrage that stray electrons from VDTs were mutating
     the last known breeding colony of Smurfs in Shuckmagosh,
     Ohio. The Teamsters, upon hearing that something moved
     without their efforts, mobilized to establish inter-state
     "transportation tariffs" on non-union movement of echomail.
     The FBI followed the Teamsters and mistakenly produced a
     "Most Wanted" TV segment which re-enacted the original
     Fidonet crime...complete with Barry Manilow background music
     played ominously on a pipe organ, and a tuba quartet.

     The situation became an international incident when some
     underwhelmingly bright individual in the Canadian Department
     of Fisheries spotted the word "net" within "Fidonet" and
     sent legions of heavily armed game wardens to the Canada/US
     border to interdict any travelers smelling of fish. Madonna
     was *not* pleased at the unpleasant hour she spent in
     detention as a result.

     As the first lawyer staggered to his feet to begin the
     Supreme Court arguments, both the plaintiff and the
     defendant looked unhappily at the scene... and wished
     fervently, as most of us do, that they'd had the wit to
     settle their differences with Nerf bats.

                             Fredric L. Rice
                               1:102.901.0

     An old program  has been dusted off,  re-written in C, and then
     made  available for the  general public:  COST.ZIP. - This file
     contains the  executable, document  file,  sample configuration
     file, and both  the BASIC  source code  and the  C source  code
     for the same program.

     o What does COST do?

     This program scans through the raw nodelist and offers a report
     detailing  those  systems which  are within  your free  and ZMU
     calling zones. It also  looks up the phone  number you offer it
     and  will  tell  you if  it's free, and if  not, what the first
     minute will cost and what each extra minute will cost. After it
     offers this information, it reminds you what discount rates are
     offered within specific times.

     o Who would use this program?

     SysOps could  use  this program to  acquire  an  automatically-
     generated  listing  of FidoNet  systems  that are  free or very
     cheap to call. This information  could be  placed into a banner
     or other menu-requestable file so that Users could find systems
     to call in your area.

     Users could use this program, of course, and by-pass the SysOps
     system  all  together  though  it  makes sense  for a  SysOp to
     provide it.

     o How is this information found?

     A  configuration  file provides  all  of  the  area  codes  and
     exchanges your system may call for free and those they may call
     to  be  charged  as  a  Zone  2  or  Zone  3  connection.  This
     information is provided  by the phone  company in the beginning
     of your phone book under the title 'Local and ZMU calling.' The
     entry of this data  isn't exhausting.  I'd like  to offer a bit
     of my configuration file for an example:

     I've displayed  only a  fraction  of  the exchange codes that I
     could  list  under each section  for my  calling areas; because
     FidoNews   is  big   enough  some    times.  Regardless,   it's
     descriptive enough, I think, to show the information required.

     o Where is it?

     This file is File Requestable as COST.ZIP from 1:102.901.0. The
     magic file name of COST will also work. The  BASIC  source code
     is  provided  for  old-times  sake...   The  C  code,  however,
     represents  a  mid-sized  effort  in  that   it's  written  and
     commented so  that a programmer  learning C  could use it  as a
     reference for pointer  manipulation and  maintenance  of linked
     lists of data structures.

     o Next Update

     This programs  next revision will  be able to update the 'cost'
     field  of *.MSG-type  header files, and then offer  a report on
     the total cost to  send the mail broken  down by system address
     based  upon  direct  origination-to-destination  routing.  Long
     Distance mail will not be added to the  accumulation though the
     report will describe how many there are.

     With some minor work, and some major cooperation, systems could
     know enough about billing to provide  least-cost-routing across
     systems by determining common free nodes between systems; in an
     automated manor by modifying the route for specific packets.

                         GateWorks is Finally Released!
                         ------------------------------


     After a whole lot of work, GateWorks is finally available to the
     general public!


     WHAT IS IT?

     GateWorks is a sophisticated echomail gating system.   It allows
     you to gate echomail conferences from up to 20 different nodes
     into a single network.   Unlike other gating software, GateWorks
     is complete.

      - GateWorks will strip foreign seen-bys and paths, inserting
        only the gateway system information.

      - GateWorks uses strict error checking so that messages that
        come into the network can not go back out.

      - GateWorks can retag echos as they come into the network.

      - GateWorks can log processed and non-processed mail so that you
        can see what and when comes into your system.

      - GateWorks adds a small GateOrigin line to each message gated
        in or out with the original address and domain so that the
        true message origin is never lost, regardless of how many
        gateways it passes through.

      - GateWorks works with nearly any front-end mailer.   It is
        standardized on using *.MO? bundles and can be run immediately
        after mail comes in before being tossed.

     Best of all, GateWorks is fast!

     It is available for freq 24 hours a day from:

             1:153/1025@fidonet              604-873-6625
             24:24/0@signet                  9600HST
             99:99/25@eggnet
             8:7501/103@the_network

     Use the magic filename GATEWORKS for the latest version.
     Support for the software is available via the GATEWORKS echo.

         ENTREPRENUER ECHOTAG SPELLING CORRECTION DAY IS JUNE 12

          As many of you are aware, there is an echo called
     ENTREPRENUER which is echo for those who are in business for
     themselves, or who would like to be.  One of the more galling
     problems is that whoever started the echo didn't bother to look
     up the spelling of the word ENTREPRENEUR in the dictionary and
     thus the tag is misspelled, as shown above.  This invariably
     leads to comments from newcomers to the echo, asking why the
     word ENTREPRENEUR is misspelled.

          To put an end to this, as current moderator I have
     arbitrarily picked June 12, 1991 as ENTREPRENUER ECHOTAG
     SPELLING CORRECTION DAY.  On that date I am asking everyone
     that carries the ENTREPRENUER echo, but especially the backbone
     nodes, to correct the spelling of the echo tag.  I picked June
     12 because it is a Wednesday and therefore is in the middle of
     a week, when echo hub operators are less likely to be out of
     town, and also because it's far enough in the future to get the
     news to everyone via Fidonews.

          I realize we may lose a few messages in the switch, but it
     will be worth it to get this problem corrected, and it's much
     easier than trying to start another echo with the correct
     spelling and then get everyone to migrate to it.

          If you run an echomail processor that allows it, you may
     wish to do something like this to help guard against lost
     messages:

          C:\MSG\ENTREPRE ENTREPRENUER
          C:\MSG\ENTREPRE ENTREPRENEUR net/node net/node ... etc.

     (Note the same directory is used for both the old and new tags)

          This will cause any messages that happen to come in with
     the old tag to be properly tossed to the correct area, but when
     they are scanned out they will have the correct tag.  You would
     only need to do this for a few days after June 12, and I'm not
     insisting that you do it at all, only that you can if you want
     to.

          One other request.  One of the other most galling
     complaints that we get is the number of messages related to
     Multi-Level Marketing in the ENTREPRENEUR echo.  A few months
     ago I started a separate echo called MLM for those messages,
     which is also carried on the backbone, but for some reason a
     majority of the MLM messages still seem to wind up in
     ENTREPRENEUR.  This seems to bother some folks who would rather
     talk about other kinds of business enterprises so in order to
     help keep these topics separated, I am requesting that those
     boards that carry ENTREPRENEUR also carry MLM.  I am not so
     foolish as to try and make this a requirement, but I AM nicely
     FidoNews 8-21                Page 37                  27 May 1991


     asking everyone that carries ENTREPRENEUR to PLEASE consider
     also taking MLM, since it will only improve the quality of both
     echoes if we can migrate the MLM-related messages to the MLM
     echo.

          But in any event, if you carry ENTREPRENUER, please
     remember to correct the spelling of the echo tag to
     ENTREPRENEUR sometime during the day on June 12.  Thank you for
     your assistance.

                     Jack Decker, moderator of ENTREPRENEUR and MLM.

     Robert Johnson
     FidoNet 1:327/1

                          SoundNet Has Arrived!

       Yes!  A new files network has been born.  It has no fancy or
     flashy acronym, and is simply known as SoundNet.  It's a net
     whose time has come.

       More and more, computer users are outfitting their units with
     some sort of sound board or MIDI interface.  Tandy and Amiga
     users have always known the joys of a good sounding computer.
     Now IBM users are forsaking the old beeper speaker for the more
     sophisticated sounds that eminate from the likes of AdLib,
     SoundBlaster or MIDI interface boards.

       With so many users getting into this technology, it has been
     decided that a file sharing network of FidoNet bulletin boards,
     was exactly what was needed, to promote and enhance this music
     medium.

       We'd like to support, not only files that pertain to
     the current music systems out there, but also anything that
     pertains to music.  Musical Database programs as well as
     programs that print music manuscripts.  In other words if it is
     related to music, we'd like to carry the program or file.

       Currently there are 40 FidoNet Systems in Zone 1, and 1 node
     in Zone6: Japan, who are a part of SoundNet.  We would like to get
     more units involved!  Zone 3, Zone 2...EVERYONE!

       So consider this an open invitation, to join the newest files
     network on the bitstream.  For more information File Request
     SOUNDPAK.ZIP at 1:327/1.  The more systems involved, the better
     we can support the fine efforts of authors and composers out there.

       I Hope to hear from you real soon!

                                             Bob Johnson

     Z1C Election Status
     Harry Lee (1:321/202)
       (AKA Stupid One Who Volunteered To Count)
       (AKA Person With Sufficient Fingers For The Task)

     There are three candidates for the position of Z1C.  They are,
     in the order I was made aware of them:
       George Peace
       Jesse David Hollington
       John Summers

     Voting commenced 5/24, and continues until June 1.  Z1RC's
     should send votes directly to 321/202, with a password.  The
     regions that have voted and the passwords will be published
     in RegCon and Z1_Election as they are received, once daily.

     Individual votes will be EXPLICITLY acknowledged via direct
     netmail by me.

     A majority (50% + 1) of votes cast is required to elect.
     If no candidate receives a majority of the votes, a runoff
     will be held between either the top two candidates, or, in
     the event of a tie in second place, all the candidates in
     the first and second vote positions.  The voting period for
     this runoff will be one week.  If necessary, this process
     will be repeated until the RC's reach a consensus.

     The following is the current state of the voting for Z1C:

      Rgn Pwd
       10
       11
       12
       13
       14
       15
       16 AnotherTerm
       17 Eileen
       18
       19

     No password indicates that no vote has been received at 321/202
     for that region.

     Paul Knupke, Jr.
     Florida Telecom Central
     Largo, Florida USA

     1:3603/130.11 and soon to be assigned a real node number :-)

     One early morning, sometime after midnight, after getting home
     from work, I decided to start writing a general column for
     Fidonews.  This monthly column is going to be a mishmash of my
     thoughts, ideas and observations.   So here goes ...

     Here it is a rainy, humid Florida evening and I'm sitting here
     getting ready to head out to The DreamLand Express BBS'
     (1:3603/30) weekly "Pit Crew" at the local Denny's restaurant.
     I guess there isn't a better time to start.

     Fidonet is large (now isn't that an understatement!) Anyone
     who meets the basic FidoNet technical standards and can
     operate duringZone mail hourcan be assigned a node number.
     You can run IBM (MS-DOS or OS/2), Commodore Amiga, Atari ST,
     Apple 8 bit and Macintosh, UNIX based system or a Tandy Color
     Computer.  Most of us have a large selection of frontend
     mailers, bbs programs, and utilities.

     With more than 11,000 members, Fidonet is by far the largest
     bulletin board based network.  The closest "competitor" barely
     has one tenth the membership of Fidonet.  This large size has
     its advantages and disadvantages.

                              Advantages:

     Most people don't have to call long distance to connect to a
     hub system.

     Costs can be split among several to many people to cut down
     the amount of money hubs spend to bring echomail in.

     If you have a software or hardware problem there probably is
     someone who has a similar configuration that can assist you.

     You are not limited in the usage to a single program to handle
     your network mail.  (This is also a disadvantage.)

     Many computers have Fidonet compatable software.

                             Disadvantages:

     FidoNews 8-21                Page 41                  27 May 1991


     The nodelist is approaching a one megabyte!

     With such a wide variety of programs used by nodes, updating
     Fidonet technology has become a very difficult task without
     suddenly shutting out a segment of the network.

     (and I am sure all of you can think of others)

     I am not sure how to address these disadvantages exactly ...

     Last week Aaron Goldblatt introduced the Ft. Worth Nodelist
     format.  His concept has its merits.  I'd like to know how
     large the nodelist would be using the Ft. Worth Nodelist.
     Could the nodelist be imported into a database program to
     create a sample Ft. Worth nodelist?  If so we could see what
     the size savings would be.

     There are some problems with the Ft. Worth nodelist.  It would
     work fairly well in the United States and Canada but not in
     other parts of the world.  The deletion of the area code in
     most cases would not cause a problem.  In cases where a node
     is outside the area code of his network coordinator and not to
     mention Europe where the phone numbers, city codes and so
     forth don't follow any set format would certainly cause
     problems.  I think removing area codes and so forth would
     cause untold problems.

     Instead of removing the the "X" mail flags, remove the X and
     just use A, B, C, P, X, and W and so forth because some
     smartmailers do make use of them (ie Frontdoor 2.00+) I agree
     on removing all redundancy as well as dropping the ending
     zeros on the baud entry.

     In light of things maybe we could move to Zone nodelists
     instead.  Sysops would receive Z1DIFF, Z2DIFF etc and proccess
     the nodelists they need producing Z1LIST etc.

     On to other things...

     GroupMail or not GroupMail ...

     GroupMail has many advantages as pointed out in previous
     shnoozes.  The problem is not every platform has a GroupMail
     processor and all mailers are not capable of update requests.
     Unfortunatly by moving to Groupmail my recent purchase of
     TosScan will become obsolete <sigh>.

     Now a geography lesson ...

     In North America geographic nets are to our advantage cost
     wise.  Its been said many times that if geographic boundaries
     were dropped a NC could deny a node number to someone knowing
     that they can't afford to join a net outside of their local
     area.  Let zone polices address this issue.

     FidoNews 8-21                Page 42                  27 May 1991


     Speaking of policy ...

     Well WorldPol has been defeated and apathy is at an all time
     high.  Something is wrong when only 3 of 40 networks in a
     certain region even cast votes.  Hey net coordinators lets get
     with it!  Net Coordinator isn't just a title, you have duties
     under Policy.  I'm not speaking to ever NC, just some of you.
     Our illustrious editor, Vince, said reciently that those
     coordinators who didn't do their job should be removed.  Let
     the nodes decide ... and have a yearly election of net
     coordinators across the board.

     Confused yet? Well ...

     Here it is Friday and I was thinking of how confused I've been
     lately.  I'm working with two local Atari ST sysops setting up
     BinkleyTerm-ST.  I didn't know anything about Binkley (I'm a
     Frontdoor user...) and then I'm working on an Atari ST.  We're
     getting close and with the help of plenty of BinkleyTerm-ST
     &BBS Express ST sysops.  (Thanks guys!)

     Politics ... Shmolotics ...

     Well I'd rather not talk about this, but at least some zones,
     regions and nets are doing things democratically!  Thanks to
     all those who have pushed for a democratic Fidonet (Fred
     Niemczenia, number of regional coordinator, the grunt sysops,
     and especially Pablo Kleinman in Buenos Aires).

     Oh well till next month ....

     Happy Summer (or Happy Winter ..)
     and for those in the United States, Happy Memorial Day.

     The 4th Annual Poor Man's Fidocon and Lake Party --

     After three eventful years, the 1991 PMFC&LP was hard pressed
     to find a spot until our own native son John Summers volun-
     teered to combine our event with his own wife's 2nd Annual
     Birthday Lake Party.

     Diana is a saintette and deserves a big present from everyone.
     I mean, what would your wife say if 700 sysops showed up at
     your door ?  "No way!"  "Way!"  "No way!"  "Way!"  I can't
     exactly print what Honey would say.

     The following is a quote from an early announcement by John :

     Plan to attend another fun filled weekend at Cedar Creek
     Lake. There is plenty of room to pitch a tent, picnic, and
     party! The lake during the summer months is great for
     swimming or boating (boats are welcome) or just laying
     around visiting with friends.

     Those who attended last year can tell you that all had a
     good time and enjoyed -

                         Boating
                           Beer
                  Sailing (thanks Dewey)
                           Beer
                       BBQ Chicken
                           Beer
                An EXCELLENT Cat fish fry
                           Beer
               AND Many other activities!!

     Mark your calendar, tell your wife/husband and/or girl/boy
     friend to plan on it, bring the children and come on out!!!

     Date - Friday the 14th of June thru Sunday the 16th
             (come spend whatever time you like)

     Where - John & Diana Summers place on Cedar Creek Lake

                  Directions -

     From anywhere in the metroplex (Dallas/Ft. Worth), find your
     way to I-30 and LBJ Freeway on the EAST side of Dallas. Take
     635 LBJ South until you see the sign "Kaufman - 175". Take US
     Highway 175 toward Kaufman. Continue on US 175 thru Crandal,
     curving around Kaufman and just past Kemp. There is a big sign
     there that says Hwy. 274 - Seven Points. There is an Exxon
     station at this intersection.

     FidoNews 8-21                Page 44                  27 May 1991


     Take Texas Highway 274 to the light in 7-Points (there is only
     one light). Turn Left at the light. Come down the road just
     over a mile and turn Left on Nob Hill Rd. This road is just
     after the crest of the hill, just after the H&R Block on the
     left and just before the Chamber of Commerce on the Right. If
     you go past the "China Wok" restaurant or come to the Shell
     station/marina, you have just passed the corner, turn around
     and come back up the hill!

     Follow Nob Hill Road almost all the way to the lake until you
     see a white sign with Black letters that says "Oak Landing".
     Turn Left!  Almost immediately (less than a city block) turn
     Right. Again, almost immediately, turn left. Come up to the top
     of the hill and our place is the first place on the left. The
     name is on the mail box!

     For those of you in the rest of the Region, buy a Texas road
     map.  Locate the LBJ Freeway (635) around Dallas and on the
     South East corner of Dallas, Locate Hwy. 175. Take your finger
     and follow Hwy. 175 to Kemp and find Cedar Creek Lake.

     Now that you have found the lake on the map, determine the best
     route for you from wherever you are!

     And NOW, in the current spirit of Fidonet, I bring you


     Lake Party Policy 1.0 --

     1. Any computing device discovered within 200 yards of the
     Lake Party will be summarily tossed, along with it's owner,
     into the Lake. ( Masterson -vs- Army Corp. of Eng., 1988 )

     In a 1990 appeal, a higher court affirmed, but with the
     landmark desenting opinion :

         He/she who brings the most toys wins.

     2. Emphasis on beer, I mean, Beer, is purely political and is
     only intended to remind you of the "don't be annoyed" clause.
     ( Texas Code, 1836 )  Don't be annoyed clause follows.

     Don't be annoyed clause : Don't be annoyed.  Experience has
     shown that it is impossible to be "excessively annoying" at a
     Lake Party.  Annoying behavior is encouraged for the purpose of
     providing Fidonews material.

     3. Assumed risk and liability for damages ( including but not
     limited to dented fenders ) is expressly limited to the price
     of admission.  ( Allstate -vs- Theissen, 1990 )

     FidoNews 8-21                Page 45                  27 May 1991


     4. Alternative nodelists on restroom walls may be erased only
     when inaccurate.  ( Teel -vs- Acme PortaClump, 1988 )

     5. Snakes in lakes make Danes abstain.
     ( Honey -vs- Henry, 1989 )

     Speaking of policy...


     RC For a Day --

     ( As reported in FidoNews 7.41 : )

     I actually ran for the RC position, garnering the fewest votes
     of any candidate.  The whole election was rigged because the
     incumbent RC decided to run for re-election. It'll cost me a
     bundle in psychiatric fees to get over this one.

     ( Remember that ? I thought not. )

     Well, it so happens that our illustrious ex is now bent on
     cleaning up echomail as the Z1EC.  And who ends up in the RC
     slot ?  Ah ha ha.  You guessed it.

     Honey was real POed about it too, figuring on all the extra
     time I'd be spending handling 'Police Complaints'.  She didn't
     want the neighbors to see police cars parked outside !

     Now let me get this straight :
     I am the RC for life.
     I can appoint whomever I choose as REC.
     I can replace all the NCs.
     If you don't like it, you aren't in the nodelist.

     I believe that about covers it.


     Single Threaded --

     Oh. I'm boring you to death with this 'idle time'.  Suppose you
     received 4 hours worth of mail from your feed each day, and you
     in turn fed 5 other systems.  ( Hmm, let's see, uh, 4 times 1+5
     is 24 hours. )  Ok, next line.  This full load situation is
     somewhat understated because there will be upstream mail as
     well ( you receive from downstream and send upstream ).

     Taking this scenario to the extreme, that's 12 hours in and 12
     hours out.  All the mail is passed along a single chain, and it
     takes an average of 10000 days to get a reply. Don't laugh, the
     file nets are getting bigger than the mail.

     FidoNews 8-21                Page 46                  27 May 1991


     So the distribution network splits up, say, along lines of
     'interest boundaries'.  We are learning to do that today,
     before any technological limit forces us to.


     Homemaker Extra-ordinaire --

     Remember your mom's schedule ?  No, your mom didn't run a
     mailer, she ran your house !  Yours truly, mild mannered 9 to
     5'er, encountered radioactive muffin fan lint and became :
     SuperHouseSpouse.  Faster than a coupon expiration date.  More
     powerful than a 4 H.P. Electrolux. Able to leap mounds of dirty
     clothes with a single bound.  Up in the sky, aaaah shutup!

     Young co-sysop Kevin will start school in the fall, but I have
     this great opportunity to spend the summer with him, all for
     the measly price of a few 'chores'.  Then he starts school.
     Right now, his backpack is loaded for the Lake Party and his
     new water gun looks cool.  I can't wait, either.

     Frankly this household stuff is pretty easy.
     ( but don't tell Honey ! )

     Steve Winter
     FidoNet 1:151/208 209

     Now I beseech you, brethern, mark them which cause divisions
     and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned;
     and avoid them.
     For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but
     their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches decieve
     the hearts of the simple.
     (Romans 16: 17-18)(written to the apostolic church at Rome)

     But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other
     gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you,
     let him be ACCURSED.  Galatians 1:8 (written to the apostolic
     Christians in Galatian church)

                  SO WHAT DID THE APOSTLES TEACH?

        1) Acts 2:1-4..."And they were ALL filled with the Holy
     Ghost and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit
     gave them utterance."

     (This was in the upper room where 120, including MARY the
     mother of Jesus, were gathered Acts 1:14-15).  Many false
     preachers teach that "tongues were just for the 12 apostles".

        2) Acts 2:38.  "Then Peter said unto them, repent and be
     baptised in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of
     sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost".

     The next verse mentions that this promise is to "as many as
     the Lord our God shall call."...most false preachers do not
     baptise in Jesus NAME they just use "titles"

        3)Acts 8: 15-17 (Samaria) "Who, when they were come down,
     prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost:
     (For as yet he was fallen on none of them: only they were
     baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.) Then they laid their
     hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost."

     Many false preachers teach that you automatically have the
     Holy Ghost when you first "believe on the Lord"

        4) Acts 10: 44-48 (First gentiles saved) "And they of the
     circumcision (Jews) which believed were astonished, as many
     as came with Peter, because that on the gentiles also was
     poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.  FOR THEY HEARD THEM
     SPEAK WITH TONGUES, and magnify God. Then answered Peter.
     Can any man forbid water that these should not be baptised
     which have received the Holy Ghost as well as well as we?
     And he commanded them to be baptised in the name of the Lord."

     FidoNews 8-21                Page 48                  27 May 1991


     False preachers teach people that they allready have the Holy
     Ghost even though they don't even believe in tongues.

        5) See also Acts 19:1-6...Galatians 3:27...Acts 22:16
     "As we said before, so say I again, If ANY MAN preach any
     other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be
     ACCURSED."(Galatians 1:9)
