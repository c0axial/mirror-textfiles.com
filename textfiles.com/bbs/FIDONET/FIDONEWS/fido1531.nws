     Fidonet over IP, Part 3 of 4:
     Proposals for integration of IP-nodes in the nodelist
     Copyright 1998 by Lothar Behet

     Part 1 and 2 in last weeks FidoNews issue contained a definition
     of Fidonet-over-IP and the available software.

     As the internet can be used as additional carrier for FidoNet data
     exchange, there are several ways of using its addressing
     capabilities for direct connections between fido-nodes.

     1. IP numbers (dotted quad like 194.231.142.17)
     2. Fully Qualified Domain Names (like fido.nrh.de)
     3. Address resolution by node number in a dedicated domain
        (like f301.n2446.z2.<domain_name>)

     Lets take a look at each of them:

     1. IP numbers

     The direct use of ip numbers looks like a direct replacement for
     a phone number in the conventional environment. Furthermore it
     just contains numbers, which is in accordance to the possible
     format for a phone number in the St.Louis nodelist format.

     The dashes in the nodelist may be translated by an actual nodelist
     compiler without further complications, as soon as the program has
     an information about the real contents of the phone number field in
     the nodelist, which may be signified by a flag or eventually just
     by a special country code.

     This already shows the major problem for conventional nodes:
     There is a high risk for calling an ip number as direct phone
     number, if the system in question is not aware of it.
     As any system uses a dial translation table, the special country
     code for ip numbers is required anyway for safe dial suppression
     in that case.

     Furthermore this is only usable for nodes with an static ip number,
     but this does not imply a permanent connection.

     2. Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)

     The FQDN uses a special service in the internet, the Domain Name
     Service (DNS), which translates a name (i.e. fido.nrh.de) to
     (normally) an static ip number (194.231.142.17). Furthermore
     the FQDN may be resolved to a dynamic ip number, if such a
     service is used (i.e. dyn.ml.org, dynip.com), so that even
     nodes with a normal dialin connection may utilize this system.

     But there is no possibility for publishing a FQDN in the phone
     FIDONEWS 15-31               Page 3                    3 Aug 1998


     field, according to FTS-5, on which any conventional fidonet
     system is based for the dialing part.

     The FQDN has to be published in another field, i.e. system name,
     location or flag space in the nodelist.

     As ip numbers and FQDNs are not geographically organised, this
     (sometimes quite interesting) information should still be kept
     in the nodelist.

     Some programs just examine a part of the flag space, so this
     field might not be the optimal choice, as we need some of it
     for additional flags.

     So the system name seems to be the most appropriate, based on
     technical reasons.

     3. Address resolution by node number in a dedicated domain
        (like f301.n2446.z2.<domain_name>)

     This schedule is already used in the domain "fidonet.org" (run by
     George Peace, Pennsylvania Online) for the addressing of gateways
     between fidonet and internet. "fidonet.net" (run by Ustinov Fyodor,
     Prospect Investment) uses the same schedule for addressing normal
     nodes, which have an MX-entry (mail exchange) pointing to their
     FQDN or static ip number in that domain.

     As domain names are not free of charge, these rely on a good willing
     sponsor or the community has to share the costs of it.

     The publication of an entry in this schedule may be done by any
     node, that fulfills the requirements of the domain administrator.
     In practice, the publication is easy, but mostly the information
     about stopping a certain service is forgotten by individual nodes.
     Normally, a network coordinator (NC) is quite informed about his
     networks status, but not all of them have internet connectivity
     for servicing this system and therefore the maintenance may fall
     out of the responsible *C-class within the FidoNet.

     Based on this considerations, i wrote a proposal for the
     integration of ip nodes in the nodelist after examining
     the results of my "ip-query-sheet" in IP_CONNECT
     (version 2.0, dated Jan. 4th, 1998):

     Proposal for integration of IP-Nodes into the Nodelist
     by Lothar Behet, v. 2.0

     1.  The phone_field is used for the ip-number.

     This implies a special country code for ip-nodes, which might
     result in 000-aaa-bbb-ccc-ddd for an ip-address. The prefix
     "000-" may not be shortened or modified in any way by existing
     or future software, as a mixup with conventional phone numbers
     will lead to an annoying misbehaviour.
     FIDONEWS 15-31               Page 4                    3 Aug 1998


     Without dial-translation this prefix will normally result in
     undiable numbers. In special cases (pbx) a dial-translation is
     implemented in the nodelistcompiler or the mailer, so that no
     erronious dials can occure.

     The mostly character-based FQDN will result in an undiable
     number by most modems (analog and ISDN), but the usage is
     limited until any existing nodelist software has proven its
     compatibility with these entries.

     In the meantime the FQDN may be published in the system_name_field
     and nodelist compilers (or utilities) should optionally use that
     field for exaggeration of the FQDN.


     2.1  Individual flags for ip-based handshaking protocols

     As there are existing flags on a wide range of leading characters
     (sometimes forming groups like H(st) or Z(yxel)), a special
     lead-in character seems reasonable for ip-flags, especially
     for human readability and easy utility construction.

     The genaral format is

         <basic_transport>:<port>:<handshake_specification>

     Basic transport is required.

     As many setups use the default ports, this part may be omitted.
     Handshake specification is another optional field.

     The construction of the flag-set is designed for nowadays available
     software and allows in most cases a seamless implementation on many
     systems.


     2.1.1   basic transport

     The proposed flags for transport layer (includes some hansshake
     protocols) are:

         IBN     BinkP (default port 24554)

         IFC     ifcico (default port 60179)

         ITN     telnet (default port 23)

         IVM     Vmodem (default port 3141)

         IP      raw tcp (anything else, which is not
                 specified by other transport flag)

     These are mainly focused on the nowadays available programs
     and subject to expansion in the future.

     As intermediate option the general flag "IP" is proposed for
     FIDONEWS 15-31               Page 5                    3 Aug 1998


     new  technologies, to allow rapid distribution until exact
     protocol specifications are published. Until then, the
     interested nodes may define  their capabilities usinf the
     full format (2.1.1 to 2.1.3).


     2.1.2   port specification (optional)

     Non-standard ports use a colon as delimiter behind the
     basic transport flag, i.e.:

         ITN:60177      ifcico with additonal telnet-patch (port 60177)


     2.1.3   handshake session specification (optional)

     These follow the specifications for conventional mailers.

         1       FTS-0001

         Y       Yohoo

         E       EMSI

         B       BinkP

     Multi-protocol capable mailers should listen to the specific
     default ports or use the optional port specification.

         Sample:
         IP:24555:1YEB       uses raw ip on port 24555 and supports
                             sessions according to FTS-1, Yohoo, EMSI
                             and BinkP

     Additional protocols may be developed in the future and added to
     this list, if the specification is publicly available.


     2.2     Flags for other ip-based protocols and other capabilities

         IEM     Email-based (generally)

         IFT     File Tranfer Protocol (FTP)

         ITX     Transx

         IUC     Uuencoded packet (one per message)

     This list may be extended in the future, too.

     2.3     Additional flags/special purpose

         IFQ     This flags advises the nodelist-compiler to use the
                 system_name_field as "fully qualified domain name" in
                 place of the ip-address in the phone_field

     FIDONEWS 15-31               Page 6                    3 Aug 1998


     3.  At least one flag of group 2.1 (including optional non-standrad
         ports) is required for an ip-node. Additional publication of
         non-handshaking-potocols (group 2.2) is allowed.

     4.  The minimum online-time is either CM or clearly stated through
         a T-flag according the known specification in the (Zone2)
         nodelist. ZMH-only ip-nodes are not excluded from the nodelist.

     >-8------------------------ byte here ------------------------8-<

     In return, Marco d'Itri created his own one :), which differs in
     some aspects:

     1. He uses the "IP" as a general flag for exclusion of
        ip-node-dialing by conventional nodes.

     2. Usage of other flag names (based on the usage in Z2 at this
        moment)

        Handshaking protocols:
             IBN --> BNP             BinkP
             IFC --> RAW             ifcico
             ITN --> TELN            Telnet
             IVM --> VMP             Vmodem

     Additional protocols:
             IEM --> IEM             generally Email based
             IFT --> FTP             FTP based
             ITX --> TRX             TransX based
             IUC --> UUE             uuencoded packet (one per message)

     In his FTA-proposal, Marco decided to prefer the location field
     in place of the system name as place to publish the FQDN.

     >-8------------------------ byte here ------------------------8-<

     Both actually filed complete proposals in "IP_CONNECT" try to
     integrate the ip nodes in the nodelist and leave room for combined
     entries, as the FQDN (or an ip number) is announced in another field
     beside the phone number.

     The responsibility for these entries is inside the normal *C-class
     within FidoNet.

     There were some more ideas on certain parts and additionally the
     proposal of "fidonet.net"-domain-service, which puts responsibilities
     outside the *C-class.

     Part 4 (next week :) will contain my considerations about policy
     requirements for ip-nodes, possibilities with these proposals and
     some additional comments.

     Dear Editorbeing,

     This column is submitted by Doc Logger(163/110) who was
     shocked and dismayed and amused and surprised that in
     addition to his many other deficiencies, Ward Dossche owns
     ABBA records. If ever his legions of detractors needed proof
     of his strange intent towards Fidonet, his musical tastes
     must surely be proof positive. As the good and decent people
     that we are, I suggest that someone offer to hem his
     bell-bottoms so that rampant democracy doesn't get out of
     hand and cross the Atlantic to North America.

     Roll da flic, Zorch....

     Dear Reverend Visage,

     It has been another slow  week in Fidoland. If it weren't
     for the fact that my annual zucchini crop was about to
     undergo its logarithmic expansion, I'd have almost no
     serious issues to confront. Mercifully, Darryl Gregorash has
     kept the ZIC echo alive with his endless requoting of a John
     F. Kennedy piece of fluff. The fact that Kennedy neither
     wrote it, nor believed in it, doesn't seem to faze Darryl in
     the least. The essence of the debate is whether the
     elflords, by virtue of enough fartcatching to have been
     appointed to sit at Satti's feet, have the Divine right to
     override majority opinion and vote according to what they
     presume to be the best interests of Fidopeasants.
     Unfortunately, Satti remains cowering in his bunker and
     hasn't emerged for months. Our prayers and our edible
     underwear should go out to him in his many hours of
     narcosis.

     As I mentioned last week, I've been beavering over a program
     to simulate a number of events which occurred in the early
     life of the universe. The program is being written in
     Italian, which is to say that it is some of the worst
     spaghetti code ever written if you discount the efforts of
     the patients of the Head Injury Re-Learning Centre who
     invented COBOL. Actually, the core of the program is written
     in PROLOG which is touted as an "artificial intelligence"
     language. (What this really means is that you have to be an
     acid crazed dwarf to understand PROLOG's syntax.) The reason
     that I chose to torture myself by using PROLOG is that I
     needed something with the bizarre ability to rewrite the
     executable program on the fly to foreshorten some of the 100
     million iterative steps. The results which slowly emerge
     from the program are quite amusing. For example, had the Big
     Bang generated just a tiny fraction less mass, the world
     would have been spared the abomination of yogurt. (The world
     FIDONEWS 15-31               Page 9                    3 Aug 1998


     also would have been spared of life, but that is a minor
     price to pay for a yogurt free universe.)

     This would be an ideal place to segue into the gestalt of
     programming, and from there into a discussion of what makes
     a medium like Fidonet. Judging from the first sentence in
     this paragraph, all six readers of the Snooz will already
     know that there are some hairpin turns involved in the
     thought processes necessary to connect these concepts. To
     start with, I've been intrigued by the way people write
     computer programs which is analogous to the way people write
     novels or paint pictures. Some people start with a clear
     vision of what the finished product should be and map the
     outlines of the intervening steps. Others, see a goal and
     launch into the process without clear definition of how to
     get there. The former type of programmers are generally more
     reliable, but the latter are often the beneficiaries of
     serendipitous discoveries along the way. In the interval
     between the two styles are those who get lost in the
     process. It is getting lost in the process that brings this
     around to the issue of Fidonet.

     The same issues that continually arise with respect to the
     Snooz have recently emerged in the FN_SYSOP echo. Legions of
     sysops express opinions about "what should not be." In the
     case of the Snooz, the objections trend towards whichever
     sacred moose isn't being given preferential reportage. What
     most of the critics seem to ignore is that *they* are the
     reporters who could submit whatever it is that would satisfy
     their notions of "what should be." Unfortunately, the energy
     required to make those submissions is redirected towards
     advocating what should be excluded. The FN_SYSOP echo is a
     sort of microcosm of the Fidonet world and we have been
     blessed by the musings of Maurice Kinal who believes that a
     moderator should impose some sort of vision on the echo. The
     desire has been expressed in phrases such as "higher ideals"
     etc. Sadly, raising the ideals seems to involve removing
     anything deemed to contrary to that goal. In my opinion
     (entirely devoid of any speck of humility), the key to
     raising the tenor of any echo is by positive contribution as
     opposed to negative sanctions.

     I must go Visage, Ron Mitchell has caused many sleepless
     nights by informing me that my entire stuffed armadillo
     collection may be infected with leprosy. If he's right, I'll
     have to start losing more bets.
