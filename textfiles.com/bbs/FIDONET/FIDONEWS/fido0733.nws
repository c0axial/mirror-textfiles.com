                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================

     This week, I gave the whole archiving issue some serious thought.

     As usual, I went through the gamut of emotions and kept vacillating
     between wanting to write the flame of the century, and just quietly
     pulling the plug. All foolish thoughts. I think that's what friends
     are for.  To help keep foolish thoughts from becoming foolish deeds.
     I should probably consult them even more often than I do.

     I have pretty much decided what I am going to do vis-a-vis
     compression methods for FidoNews. But I'm not up to composing the
     entire explanation right now. Besides, between Isaac Aziza and Saddam
     Hussein, I think we're busy enough for this week.

     On another front, we're trying something different this week. We're
     publishing an article that includes a picture. This picture is in GIF
     format. The filename syntax I have decided on is based on the current
     FidoNews issue and picture number, so the one picture this week will
     be named FN073301.GIF, which means the first picture in FidoNews
     Volume 7 Number 33.

     I don't know how all this is going to work out. It might be the only
     time I ever try this. We might find a format other than GIF that
     makes more sense for FidoNews. But it seems relatively harmless to
     try it once and see what happens. Besides, the story it accompanies
     is funny enough anyway!

     Cheers,
     Vince

     MORAVSIK TAKES OVER FIGHT-O-NET!!!
     ----------------------------------


     [Photograph in File FN073301.GIF]


     Morristown, NJ -- in an unexpected turn of events, Robert J.
     Moravsik, an attorney from Morris Plains, NJ has been named
     International Coordinator of Fight-O-Net, taking office
     immediately, according to wire services. Moravsik replaces
     Waylon & Madam as IC, and has already begun work on the tedious
     task of restoring control of the network to the general
     membership.

     In a press conference scheduled for later today, Moravsik is
     expected to announce the first phase of his "power monger"
     purge, naming several Fight-O-Criminals to face the
     excommunication squad. Reliable sources indicate that several
     persons have been arrested by the Echomail Police and will face
     prosecution for serious socioecho violations committed over the
     last several years. Moravsik is also expected to announce the
     lifting of the Iron Curtain that has kept most Fight-O-Net
     members in New Jersey under the heavy handed rule of the
     Deathnet Group Censor.

     A Moravsik spokesman, shortly after the IC appointment
     announcement, was quoted as saying "It's Bob-O's intention to
     liberate Nyet 107, the last bastion of totalitarianist rule in
     New Jersey, and possibly in all of Fight-O-Net North America."

     Moravsik is expected to announce his new cabinet later in the
     week.

     SSS WORRIED
     -----------


     The Secret Sissy's Society (SSS), the governing body of DeathNet,
     issued a statement shortly after being informed of the Moravsik
     appointment. SSS Spokesthing Lord Dimwit Buonozo the Excessive
     stated that no democratic takeover of Fight-O-Net would be
     tolerated while the SSS says it's in control. "The appointment of
     Moravsik is meaningless. Any attempt at democracy that is not
     drafted or at least approved by the SSS will not be permitted and
     will not be tolerated. If Moravsik thinks he can have democracy
     without our approval, then we'll just have to invent enough nodes
     to cast enough votes to vote him out."

     When informed of possible opposition by the SSS, the Moravsik
     camp simply responded that "excommunicated nodes have no say in
     matters that concern the network."

     According to insiders, one of the first people to be charged with
     serious socioecho violations will be Emperor Fabozo Gordinski.
     Gordinski has been charged with doctoring origin lines and node
     numbers in order to deceive conference participants. It is not
     known at this time if Gordinski is actually in custody.

     Moravik's rise to power began with his uncontested election to
     the post of Moderator of the SYSOP conference, his hard-hitting
     investigation of the ConGate scandal, and his revelation of
     echomail profiteering in the network. Once an unwilling member
     of the DeathNet regime, Moravsik defected in May of 1989 and
     devoted his energies to uncovering rampant abuses, censorship,
     and coverups in that organization.

     Preston McMurry
     A Sometime Sysop

                          A View From the Edge

     Is it just me, or does it seem like there is a general lack
     of tolerance in some echoes? Specifically, the HUMOR echo and
     some of the adult echoes. Users seem to take the controversial
     nature of those echoes as an license to violate the FidoNet
     rule against flaming. Constantly. With great vehemance.

     Granted, some people are going to be offended by the very nature
     of certain echoes (GAYNEWS, for example). But that is not an
     excuse to join an echo just to criticize it. Nor is THAT an
     excuse to turn on full afterburners in response. You don't need
     to respond to twits. You shouldn't respond to twits.

         If you see an attack on something you believe in, or on
         someone you like, it is human nature to want to answer the
         challenge. Instead, think about whether you really should
         reply. If you violently disagree with what you just read,
         a reply may not be the best idea ...

     Chances are if you don't respond, the twit will not continue
     his/her disruption. The only reason twits do twit-like things
     is to get attention. Call them 'Terro-twits.' Remember, humor
     is the best response. And a string of expletives isn't, despite
     what Eddie Murphy might believe, funny.

     I can deal with 'terro-twits.' I know what their game is, and I
     don't let it bother me. But what really gets me is those folks
     who respond to 'terro-twits': They cause the problem to get
     blown up out of all proportion to the original damage done and,
     in my opinion, are even more annoying than the original dummy
     who started the whole fracas.

     USERS, if you feel that another user has been 'excessively
     annoying,' let your sysop know. S/he can do something about it.
     You can't. Especially not by escalating the verbal war. Let the
     moderators and sysops handle the twits - it's their job.

     SYSOPS, if the twit is on another board, let the twit's home
     sysop know - not the whole echo. Try to deal with the problem
     at the lowest level possible.

     MODERATORS, keep a closer eye on your echoes. If a 'terro-twit'
     strikes, don't try to reason with him/her. Just send netmail
     to the originating board letting the sysop know that one of
     his/her users is being a weenie. If the behavior continues to
     occur (and don't forget the inherent delays in echo - there may
     still be some twit garbage in the system), cut that board off.

     As a user, it bugs me when I have to wade through a single
     'terro-twit' incursion, and several dozen indignant responses,
     just to get a few on-topic messages. As a sometime sysop, it
     costs me.

     I now return you to your regularly scheduled newsletter ...

               LONG DISTANCE COMPETITION COMES TO CANADA?

     An article in the August 6, 1990 issue of _Communications Week_
     (a U.S.  telecommunications industry publication) tells how
     Toronto-based Unitel (a company jointly owned by the Canadian
     Pacific Railway and Rogers Cable) wants to build a long
     distance voice network and link it to the networks of the local
     exchange carriers owned and operated by Bell Canada.  Of
     course, Bell Canada is opposed to this, saying that Canada is
     too small in terms of population (25 million as opposed to some
     250 million in the U.S.) to support two networks carrying long
     distance traffic.  Unitel feels that competition would force
     Bell Canada to lower its rates and improve its network.

     What's interesting and potentially important to Canadian sysops
     is one statement in the article:  "Unitel ... already competes
     with Bell Canada for long distance data traffic."

     A previous article, in the January 29, 1990 issue of _Network
     World_ (another U.S. telecommunications industry publication)
     clarifies the situation:  "Although [CNCP Telecommunications,
     the predecessor to Unitel] provides some switched services
     today on its long-haul, fiber-optic, microwave network, it is
     prohibited from dumping switched voice onto the public
     network."

     Later in the same article:  "If CNCP was able to enter the
     switched voice market ... the company would follow the same
     tack it has taken with facsimile service, which it began
     offering in 1989 at prices 25% to 30% below those available
     through the public switched network.

     "CNCP offers fax service over a network of several Northern
     Telecom, Inc.  DMS-250 switches, which also handle the
     company's private switched voice traffic."

     Stop and think about this for a moment... don't fax machines
     use plain old ordinary garden variety telephone lines to
     communicate with each other?  So the question arises, if CNCP
     (now Unitel) can handle fax transmissions, why couldn't someone
     sign up for that service, then unplug the fax machines, plug in
     a couple of telephones, and carry on a conversation at rates
     30% below the rates offered by their local phone company?
     Well, apparently, the answer is that they could, except that
     it's not "legal", and some equipment has been installed to
     prevent this.  To further quote from the Network World article:

     "Users access the fax network by dialing into their local
     carriers, which maintain dedicated links to the CNCP long-haul
     network.  Although this network could be used to transmit
     switched voice to the local exchange, CNCP is currently
     required to install devices that shut down a circuit if voice
     traffic is transmitted for more than a minute."
     FidoNews 7-33                Page 7                   13 Aug 1990


     If I were a Canadian sysop, and were moving any volume of mail
     via long distance within Canada, I'd sure want to investigate
     the availability and pricing of access to that Unitel fax/data
     network.  After all, modem tones are modem tones, whether they
     come from the modem within a fax machine or the modem attached
     to a personal computer.  Their network should be able to handle
     either one perfectly well.  If the folks at Unitel aren't
     currently courting personal computer users as customers, it's
     probably only because they don't realize that there's a market
     out there.

     Personally, I live about two miles south of the border, so this
     service is of no real use to me.  But since most Canadian
     sysops probably don't have access to these U.S. publications, I
     thought I'd at least pass the word on this.

     If you'd like to have competition in voice long distance
     traffic as well (and get some of the lower long distance rates
     that we in the states have enjoyed for the last few years),
     this might be a good time to let the CRTC know about it.  The
     CRTC has already rejected competition in switched voice
     services once, back in 1985, but if you want it now, perhaps
     you can convince them that the time is right.  In the meantime,
     let me know if you have any success in getting your echomail
     via Unitel's network, and if the savings are as good as
     claimed.

                              MY BEEF



     Dear whomever:


          OK, I read with considerably less than glowing
     enthusiasm the comments of the person who wrote the
     editorial in FIDO731.NWS. That genius did not leave a name
     for all his/her efforts. Perhaps that name is familiar to
     more senior SysOps (I have played this Fido game for about
     a year). I presume that because there was no name that
     he/she decided to hide behind the skirt of obscurity.

          So much for the niceties. I have a major beef about
     the use of the LZH style archive. Regardless of whatever
     possible merits it may have (meaning that it is in the
     public domain, it's free to all the cheapos in Fido, etc.),
     the LHARC routine and its LZH tag on files archived with it
     are anything BUT standard. Look, folks, there are two
     standards: ARC and ZIP. If you don't like ARC, go to ZIP.

          Another point (you folks'll love this one) is that
     LHARC is a Japanese product. Frankly, I'm fed up to my
     eyeballs with Japanese products! So, show a little
     patriotism and pick an American archiver, for Pete's sake.

          All right, you say, this bozo's upset about our
     Japanese cousins, doesn't understand the love-hate
     relationship the gurus of Fido have with SEA, doesn't
     understand that an amatuer network requires a free software
     package, and doesn't understand that Phil Katz (author of
     the ZIP method of archiving) requires registration.

          Wrong on all counts, sweetheart. I am certain there
     are far more articulate SysOps out there than this tired,
     greying head.  Those who are can better phrase this:
     frankly, I don't care about your romance or lack of it with
     SEA. They seem to be a barrier here, so let's go around
     them. Fido should have dropped ARC a zillion years ago in
     favor of ZIP. Katz has a good product. Let's use it and
     move on.  Enough of this LZH nonsense.

          Dear leaders of Fido, either ARC the files or ZIP the
     files. But do one or the other and do it now, please. No
     more surprises. Thanks for your apt attention.

     Fido 1:275/2.1


                      Networking The Soviet Union

     Since the Iron Curtain has been pulling aside, communications
     with what was the Eastern Bloc has been on the increase.  This
     is due to the relaxation of what's called security restrictions
     on both sides, and to the interest and commitment of some of the
     just plain people involved. Already, there has been a regular
     Aeroflot flight scheduled across the Bering Straits to Nome,
     Alaska, carrying visitors and mail between newfound friends.
     Several Soviet citizens involved in that nation's computer
     community have been travelling here regularly for conferences,
     and last June held one of their own in Moscow.

     The time is right for the opening of the East, and its
     introduction into our network. As Fido grew, the idea that it
     was for everybody to be able to communicate with everybody else
     has been maintained. We are now at the point where we can act to
     expand that principle significantly. As they said in "The Six
     Million Dollar Man", we have the technology.  First, some
     background.

     I'm the senior editor for an international newsletter for Apple
     users called The Road Apple. Last summer, the publisher, Al
     Martin of Portland, OR was at an Apple conference in Kansas
     City, MO where he met Vladimir Federov of Moscow. Vladimir is
     the chief of a Soviet company called LIDAR which produces laser
     spectrography equipment for pollution research, that runs on
     their Apple //e clone, the Pravetz-82. Last January, Al made a
     visit to the Soviet Union to visit LIDAR and the Pravetz
     factory, and asked Vladimir to act as our Soviet Union editor.
     Vladimir is also part of the International Computer Club in
     Moscow, and helped to arrange a conference in Moscow last June
     for any hardware and software companies to introduce themselves
     to the Soviet marketplace, and make connections with Soviet
     outlets so we may import what is produced there.  With currency
     still not convertable, business arrangements are slow going. But
     the personal contacts are booming.

     The International Computer Club consists of users of the Soviet
     computers, the Apple clone - Pravetz-82, and the IBM clone,
     Pravetz-86. (Pravetz is the birthplace of the president of
     Bulgaria, where the original computer factory was built. The
     number is the year of that model's introduction). There's also
     some western computers that have found their way there, and a
     domestic CP/M machine, but these are vastly outnumbered by the
     Pravetz models.

     FidoNews 7-33                Page 11                  13 Aug 1990


     The Pravetz-86 is given primarily to engineers and scientists,
     while the Pravetz-82 is distributed to the schools around the
     country, and to the Red Army. (The Red Army's administration
     uses a Cyrillic alphabet version of the thrice superseded
     AppleWorks 1.3 to take care of things, meaning either that
     program is much more powerful that most suppose, or else that we
     have little to fear from the Red Army in terms of organization).
     There are enough of these machines in use that many people are
     familiar enough with them to perform their own modifications,
     and to undertake tasks other than what were originally planned
     for the machine. As yet, the machines are not available for
     private ownership, but that may change along with everything
     else, and there are enough of them installed and used for
     hobbyists to have access at the workplace.

     Those hobbyists have banded together, and are taking every step
     they can to expand their computing horizons beyond their
     national borders. I propose that the time is right for us to
     reach towards an already outstretched hand, and offer our
     expertise and especially our existing software, so that we can
     form a bond with these fellow computerists.

     To accomplish the extension of the network to the Soviet Union,
     we first of all need to transfer software to them. Since there
     is no Apple compatible Fidonet software available (I'm working
     on rewriting PUPPY, with Tom Jenning's blessings, but it's slow
     going) they would need to have MS-DOS compatible versions of
     BBSs, mailers and FOSSILS. All of their computers use 5.25 inch
     drives, the IBM compat drives being 360 K only.

     I have already sent them a series of disks from a local sysop,
     with the complete Technical Standards and Policy statements,
     Remote Access, X00 and Front Door. The SPACE Echo moderator, Bev
     Freed, has offered to send me a complete version of OPUS.  What
     I would ask of the members of this network is that they send
     complete working copies (unconfigured, of course) of the
     available software of all sorts, so that it can be transferred
     to them for use. Also, any technical assistance and advice that
     can be written down and passed along would be appreciated.

     To get this to them, couriers must be used. The Soviet postal
     systems has taken it upon themselves to protect the Motherland
     from subversive elements, by promptly losing packages containing
     disks, or X-raying them into oblivion. Hand carrying them is
     allowed, and no problems have been encountered with Soviet
     customs over bringing disks into the country. Security
     restrictions have been lifted, but only in person it seems.
     Micromanagement appears to be an international concept.

     To get this software to them, then, I would ask everybody
     interested in participating to send the disks to me. I am in
     contact through business and hobby with several people who make
     trips between us, from either origin. I can arrange for the
     packages to be at the appropriate place for delivery to the
     person who will in turn get them to Moscow. This is STRICTLY due
     to the problem with the postal service there, and not to any
     FidoNews 7-33                Page 12                  13 Aug 1990


     security situation. Baggage is often checked, as many of the
     people who make the trip can attest. They can also attest that
     they have no questions asked of them by customs concerning the
     content of the disks. Besides, I'm not asking for anything that
     isn't available publically already. If the KGB wanted it, they
     would have logged on to our systems long ago and downloaded it.

     Shareware fees are somewhat of a problem. Since the currency
     isn't convertable from the Soviet Union (in fact even *within*
     the Soviet Union) payment arrangements are tough. The I.C.C. is
     dedicated to honoring all copyrights and fees for software, as
     opposed to most of the rest of the USSR, since there's no
     copyright adherence agreement between them and anyone. I can't
     speak for the I.C.C., but I do know that they would try to make
     any arrangement possible with software authors. I will go out on
     a limb, and request that in the interest of this project,
     shareware fees be forsaken. This would of course be entirely
     voluntary, but this is after all a good will gesture. Please
     consider it. If you can figure out how to create a trade
     agreement with them, I'm certain it will be honored. Money
     saide, copyrights and anti-piracy measures are strictly enforced
     by the I.C.C.

     Lest someone get the idea that this is a (not so) clever ruse to
     obtain software for my own use, let me state that my own MS-DOS
     compatibility is in the form of a daughterboard in my Apple
     IIgs, called a PC/Transporter. It has no BIOS, but only a
     translator program to allow the Apple side to take care of all
     the details.  I do not have the ability to run *any* FOSSIL, so
     this software will do me absolutely no good. If I could run
     something myself, would I be rewriting PUPPY for the Apple? If
     you wish, sealed packages with description on the outside can be
     sent. I have no intention of opening or inspecting any package
     addressed to them.

     (A thought occurs to me here, that this would be the optimal
     time to create a network library of the available software. If
     there's enough response, it could be started at this time. Y'all
     decide that.)

     Once sufficient software is in the hands of the people from the
     I.C.C., they can go to work building a network of their own, and
     learning what is necessary to keep it running. From what I've
     seen of their work, that will take nearly no time at all.

     The next step, of course, will be for the net to make the
     arrangements as to where they will fit in. I.E., will they be an
     extension to Zone 2? (Unlikely. Ground line communications in
     the U.S.S.R. is notoriously bad. Calling out to western Europe
     probably won't work). Will they be a Zone of their own? What is
     needed here is (1) educating them as to how to work with a gate,
     and (2) setting one up on this end. These details are beyond my
     humble comprehension, being a mere User and Moderator. I defer to
     the FidoPowers to forge this concept. [Sorry, I didn't finish
     this in time for the New Jersey meeting. I trust you all found
     enough to argue about anyway.  ;)  ].

     With the administration of the network connection decided, the
     final step will be to create a stable and consistent network
     signal feed. There's been some investigation done along these
     lines. I've been working with NASA on a volunteer basis, trying
     to arrange network access information for all the schools
     involved in the S.E.E.D.S. project (the tomato seed growth
     experiment with seeds kept on the Long Duration Exposure
     Facility satellite for 6.5 years), and the Video Teleconference
     project.  Our plans are to augment these projects with
     information on how to access the net, and therefore the SPACE
     Echo, so that participants, children, educators, scientists,
     administrators and astronauts/cosmonauts alike, can carry on
     follow-up conversations pertaining to the subjects they're
     involved in.

     The SPACE Echo moderator, Bev Freed, has already agreed to offer
     her services to administrate the traffic through her National
     Space Society BBS (1:129/104). Tom Jennings has given his
     copyright release for the public distribution of NODELIST
     divided up into area codes (contingent on the concurrent
     availability of the unaltered NODELIST), for the use by the
     schools to find their nearest available nodes. NASA has been
     deeply interested in the project, to the point of assigning a
     representative of the Educational Services division at Langely
     Research Center to act as point of contact. NASA Administrator
     Admiral Richard Truly has expressed personal interest in this
     project, and requested a synopsis of the structure and operation
     of Fidonet, which I subsequently provided.

     The majority, but not the entirety, of my involvement of this
     project has been altrusitic. One of the Video Teleconference
     projects was to be a link between Johnson Space Center and
     Moscow, to reunite the Apollo-Soyuz cosmonauts and astronauts.
     There was talk of including computer communications with this,
     and subsequent conferences. It occured to me that if they can
     make it happen whne they want to, then perhaps with enough
     reason, they would maintain one measley voice channel over their
     satellite network for an hour a night, so that all of us might
     benefit from the connection. To this end, I'm still working on
     the project, and doing my best to give NASA reason for gratidue
     enough to do this.

     An alternate technology that could be used is amateur
     packet-switched radio. Although I've been given contacts to
     discuss this with, I've not yet persued it. It's a more likely
     channel to work out for the connection, but I have a personal
     habit of persuing the pipe dreams first. They're more imbued
     with "neatism" when they work out.

     What I am proposing then, is a three part involvement in this
     project by the members of Fidonet.

     (1) Collection and shipping of software to the Soviet Union,
     specifically the International Computer Club, that will give
     them the ability to form a network, with the expressed intention
     of joining Fidonet.  As I am already involved doing this, I
     offer my services as the collection and distribution center.
     Other offers of people heading over there, to carry software to
     the I.C.C., would be gratefully accepted. The point is to get it
     there, not who is to do it.

     (2) Network arrangement as necessary to link the Soviet Union's
     net into our own. You've done it before, although the process is
     beyond me. You can do it again.

     (3) Electronic communication to be established by whatever means
     available, with a signal to noise ratio able to handle modem
     quality transmission, and with a consistency to allow regular
     network mail. I have some ideas and running projects, and am
     quite open to any suggestions and/or offers on this matter.

     The final message I have is to answer those who might ask why
     I'm doing this, and what my underlying concerns are. The answer
     is very simple.

     World peace.

     I figure that if enough just plain old citizens become friends,
     and learn to communicate with each other, then ultimately, their
     respective governments will do the same. The sooner we do this,
     the sooner it will come about. Sure, it's a corny reason to
     some.  This is what happens when a hippie grows up, but doesn't
     grow out of it. If my intentions are still suspect, then by all
     means, question them. Even cut me off for being excessively
     idealistic and weird. But if you do, please, somebody carry out
     this project. The means is unimportant. The end is very
     important.  Don't confuse the government with the people.
     Fidonet has always been for the people to communicate through.
     We have a power to change things that's not often considered,
     since it's very much a background operation.

     Bill Wilson, co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous, the most
     successful self-help organization in the world, once said "No
     group will ever change the world by setting out to do so. If
     there is any hope for our troubled world, it will be from those
     groups who merely give each of us the ability to change our own
     little part of it." We can change our own little part of it. We
     already have. Let's help some others change their own little
     part of it, and join with our part. We've nothing to gain,
     except friends.

     =================================================================
                           LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
     =================================================================

     Jack Decker
     1:154/8

     Letter to the Editor:

     This is my response to Steve Bonine's "Letter to the Editor"
     regarding the use of LHARC as a compression method for
     FidoNews.  Normally, I would not jump on someone who's only
     expressing their opinion, even if I disagree.  But for some odd
     reason, Steve felt the need to drag my name into the issue by
     making the comment: "Considering the content, I was led to
     wonder why Jack Decker had been asked to write a guest
     editorial for FidoNews."

     Now, it should be fairly obvious to anyone who knows anything
     about FidoNews that I had nothing to do with that editorial.
     For one thing, the writer begins the article by saying, "Vince
     foolishly keeps handing me the keys to FidoNews." I can think
     of a few people that Vince might hand the "keys to FidoNews"
     to, but somehow I doubt that I'm one of them.  For another
     thing, the writer later goes on to say:  "Systems requesting
     FidoNews, FNews*.Arc, or anything similar WILL have their
     requests honored, but with LHArc flavored files.  If this means
     my system will no longer be listed as 1/1, so be it.  There's
     nothing special about having a 1/ listing; it's actually a pain
     in the butt, done only because someone I respect greatly
     asked."  Now Steve knows that I am not now and never have been
     listed as 1/1.  In fact, if you look in the nodelist for the
     listing for 1/1, and then do a search for the same phone number
     elsewhere in the nodelist, you quickly discover that this node
     is operated by Randall Greylock.

     For some reason, Steve Bonine seems to feel the need to drag my
     name into conversations that I'm not participating in, and that
     have nothing to do with me.  He made a rather nasty (and
     totally uncalled-for) crack about me in the REGION11 conference
     shortly after he stepped down as ZC, and was rather roundly
     castigated for it by other participants of the echo.  On the
     other hand, it's true that I have been a rather outspoken
     proponent of using a more efficient archiving method than ARC,
     first for echomail and then for FidoNews and the Nodediffs, so
     perhaps this comment was intended as sort of a backhanded
     compliment.  Or maybe it's just that Steve and I rarely agreed
     on anything, but more often that not, the opinions of the
     "fellow sysops" that Steve seems so concerned about (so
     concerned that he would keep sticking them with higher phone
     bills than are really necessary by forcing everyone to keep
     shipping stuff around that has been compressed with ARC) tended
     to side with my opinions rather than his (it was a close call
     sometimes, but I think Steve's opinions were more
     representative of the old-line Fidonet power structure than of
     the "average sysop").
     FidoNews 7-33                Page 17                  13 Aug 1990


     Much as I hate to under the circumstances, I do have to agree
     with Steve that it would have been nice to have at least one
     week's warning that a change was coming.  My batch file was
     "broken" by the change, too.  On the other hand, this was one
     time when I was happy to have to fix my batch file!  It's now
     set up to receive and process FidoNews in LHARC format, and I
     have no desire to change it back to using ARC.

     Steve make the comment: "I was amazed, upon reading the
     editorial, to find that I had been forced to use products of
     SEA.  Silly me!  All these years I've been unpacking FidoNews
     using non-SEA products, and that was wrong!"  Well, in
     re-reading the editorial I didn't find any statement saying
     that anyone had been forced to use a SEA product.  What I do
     find is a statement that the creators of ARC are making
     statements to the effect that ARC has become "the industry
     standard."  I disagree with that notion, since many sysops have
     abandoned ARC for newer, better, and (in some cases) more
     freely-available compressors.  If ARC is making the claim to
     being "the industry standard" in part because it's still seen
     as the "official" compression method for Fidonet, then I feel
     it is our duty to stop showing favoritism to the products of
     one company when most of the sysops in Fidonet rarely use ARC
     for any reason other than to unARC FidoNews and Nodediffs.

     Please note carefully:  I have been accused in the past of
     being anti-SEA.  I am NOT.  In fact, I wish that the latest
     version of GroupMail (which overcomes most of the deficiencies
     of earlier versions) was more widely used in Fidonet.  I just
     happen to feel that Fidonet should not be lending "official
     support" to the products of any one company over that of
     another.

     Steve concludes with:  "I can remember when the editor of
     FidoNews CARED about FidoNet." That's a cheap shot.  Actually,
     I think the editor of FidoNews cares a lot about Fidonet.  He
     cares enough to be part of a team that has released one of the
     finest pieces of software available in Fidonet (BinkleyTerm), a
     program that is superior to some of the commercial programs,
     and has made it freely available, without requesting any
     payment at all from non-commercial users.  I think that shows
     that he cares plenty about Fidonet.  What software have you
     given to the net, Steve?  What have you ever done for the net
     besides trying to find new and creative ways to kick people out
     of it?  (Okay, that's MY cheap shot for the day... but from my
     vantage point, it was very true that Steve expended far more
     energy trying to get certain people, me especially, kicked out
     of the net than he ever spent in giving anything to the net as
     a whole.  I understand that he has some ardent supporters
     within Net 115, but relatively few outside that net.  Of
     course, one could always take the view that anyone who was not
     a supporter of Steve probably didn't last long in Net 115.
     Steve was one of the most vocal proponents of keeping
     geographic restrictions in Fidonet, and I still have to wonder
     why).

     I would like to conclude this article with the letter that I
     sent to Randall Greylock on this issue:

      Message #123, Area "NetMail"
        From: Jack Decker
          To: Randall Greylock                   Tue 07 Aug 90 10:52
     Subject: FidoNews compression

     cc: Vince Perriello 132/491
     cc: George Peace 270/101

     I just wanted to let you know that I for one very much
     appreciate the fact that you have started using LHARC for
     compression of FidoNews.  I feel that it is highly appropriate
     to do this for three reasons:

     1) LHARC is about as close to a public domain product as you
     can get, and is therefore highly suitable for use in an amateur
     communications network,

     2) LHARC compresses much better than ARC, and is sometimes even
     better than ZIP (especially on text-based files), thus saving
     everyone money on transfer times,

     3) LHARC decompressors are available for just about every type
     of computer for which Fidonet-compatible software is available,
     due to the wide availability of source code.

     I know that you know all of the above (indeed, I think you made
     essentially the same points in your editorial) but it bears
     repeating.  Besides all of that, the fact is that the ONLY
     reason that many sysops even keep a copy of ARC around anymore
     is to have the ability to decompress fidonet-related files and
     the OCCASIONAL ARC file that a user may upload (which is often
     promptly converted to some other format, such as LZH, ZIP, or
     PAK).

     It's also worth pointing out that many of us had to change our
     batch files to accommodate the .LZH format FidoNews... I did
     not mind doing that a bit, since I realize the savings
     involved!  But if I have to change my batch files to go back
     and handle FidoNews in the inefficient ARC format again, I
     don't think I'll bother.

     I would truly like to see the NODEDIFF's distributed in .LZH
     format also.  I think the time has come to make this change,
     which would probably collectively save the sysops of Fidonet
     several hundred dollars each year.

     You will probably get a few complaints from those who basically
     say "but we've never done it this way."  Please ignore them.
     If Fidonet had never changed, we'd still all be using 1200 bps
     modems, XMODEM derivatives for file transfers, and ARC only for
     compression of echomail (hardly any major echomail distributor
     uses ARC as the primary compression method anymore).  In the
     near future I suspect we will be looking at a new nodelist
     FidoNews 7-33                Page 19                  13 Aug 1990


     format, a new format for message packets, and other changes
     that will make Fidonet more efficient (and give it greater
     ability to interconnect with other networks).  The only things
     that don't change are DEAD.  The change to the use of a more
     efficient compression method for FidoNews and Nodediffs is LONG
     overdue, and I'm glad to see that you've taken this initiative.
     THANK YOU!

     Jack

     [end of copied message]

     One afterthought... here's a suggestion for Fidonews:  It would
     be nice if there were a piece of software running on 1:1/1 that
     could scan the netmail area for messages starting with a
     certain keyword sequence, and if such a message is found,
     convert the text of the message to an article file.  For
     example, if the message started with the line:

     ARTICLE: MYTEXT.ART

     ...and ended with the line:

     ARTICLE END

     ...then the text found between those keywords would be
     converted to an article file for Fidonews!  This would make
     submission of short articles much easier for some (especially
     those in other Zones, who may be reluctant to attempt a file
     attach to 1:1/1), since it would allow those short articles to
     be submitted via netmail.  I don't know if Vince or Randall
     would be open to using such a piece of software, though... what
     do you think, guys?

     [Editor's Response:

     I find myself in the interesting situation of agreeing with you.
     Harry thinks that's about the funniest thing that has happened
     to me this year. Maybe he's right.

     I do have two comments to make on your message, however. I think
     that you slammed Steve just a trifle harder than was necessary,
     and I believe that, in retrospect, his time at the helm in Zone
     1 was about as good as it could have been. I see no need to spit
     on his grave now. We can wait and see how it all looks in about
     a year, when it's easier to look at his tenure in the proper
     perspective. Maybe you'll be surprised at how you feel then.

     As for your submission idea, Send Code <chuckle>.]

     From:   Bob Beilstein of 260/369.0
     To:     Vince Perriello of 1/1.0
     Subj:   Please don't change things yet AGAIN (please?)!

     I just read your Fidonews editorial, Vince.

     While I was NOT happy with the change to LHARC, I would be even
     less happy with having to change my batch files yet again!

     I really hope you will just leave things as they now are, and
     continue to use LHARC.

     I just wish the nodelist came LHARC'ed!

          / Bob


     [Thanks for the support. We'll have an editorial next week in
     which we'll announce our decision. -- Vince]

     CIVIL LIBERTIES ECHO AVAILABLE

     The Arizona Civil Liberties Union, an affiliate of the national
     ACLU, sponsors the new CIVLIB echo. Focusing on the Constitution
     and Bill of Rights, CIVLIB is a no-holds barred forum for
     conservative and liberal viewpoints on subjects including, but
     not limited to abortion, gun control, free speech, separation of
     church and state, capital punishment, privacy rights, search and
     seizure, drug laws, victimless crime, and more.

     CIVLIB is moderated by Arizona Attorney Bob Hirschfeld, and is
     distributed (until it achieves backbone status) by direct poll
     of NCM BBS 1:114/74, HST, 24 hrs/day.

     VICTIMS OF FALSE ALLEGATIONS OF ABUSE - NEW ECHO

     The new VFALSAC Echo focuses on the growing phenomenon of false
     allegations of child abuse, especially in the context of
     domestic relations custody battles. Subjects include the
     McMartin preschool case, the Elizabeth Morgan/ Eric Foretich
     matter, excessive actions by Child Protective Services, whether
     "children never lie about molestation", the SAID Syndrome
     (Sexual Allegations In Divorce), etc.

     While not directly connected with the nationwide VOCAL
     organization (Victims of Child Abuse Laws), VFALSAC deals with
     most of the issues addressed at VOCAL meetings.

     This is NOT an echo condoning actual child abuse; rather it
     seeks to enlighten and inform about the horror of innocent
     persons being FALSELY accused of physical or sexual abuse.

     VFALSAC is distributed via direct poll from NCM BBS, 1:114/74,
     HST. Please address netmail inquiries, Areafix requests, etc. to
     Sysop/Moderator Bob Hirschfeld.
