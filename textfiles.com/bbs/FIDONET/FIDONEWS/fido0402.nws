     Daniel Tobias
     Soft Fido (380/2)
     Shreveport, LA

                         TO NOTCH OR NOT TO NOTCH?

     In response to Joe Lindstrom's column cautioning against double-
     notching disks for Commodore computers:  SOFTDISK and LOADSTAR,
     our magazines on disk for Apple and Commodore computers
     respectively, have been distributed on double-sided, double-
     notched diskettes since our founding in 1981.  Despite this, we
     have not had any more customer complaints of bad disks than would
     be expected given the number of disks we distribute.  (By the
     way, our policy is and has always been that if any of our disks
     won't run, for any reason, we will replace them free with no
     questions asked.)  Thus, we intend to continue to use the double-
     notch system to give our subscribers twice as much material as
     would fit otherwise.  (BIG BLUE DISK, our sister publication for
     the IBM PC and compatibles, does not have double notches, since
     IBM disk drives are double-sided.)

     I certainly empathize with you over the loss of an important
     program; I've had important programs and data get lost on
     occasion on all forms of media, including single- and double-
     sided disks and hard disks.  The solution is to always keep
     backup copies of everything important that is irreplaceable.


                             "CANNED" MESSAGES

     Regarding Ron Bemis' notes on "canned" messages (such as those
     sent by his shareware programs), I am a registered user of his
     programs, including OUTER and NEWFILES.  I find them to be
     excellent programs, and I have made a special effort recently to
     send the requested Shareware contributions to the authors of all
     such programs I've been using.  I have to admit Mr. Bemis' canned
     messages encouraged me to put his programs at the top of my list
     to send the contributions, just to get those silly messages to
     stop; however, I would have paid the fee regardless.

     Despite my paying up, I'm not very happy about the canned message
     scheme; I get very uneasy about programs messing around in my
     message bases, particularly when it involves placing long-
     distance phone calls automatically.  In my case, one of Bemis'
     programs (I think it was NEWFILES) started sending messages with
     the program name field messed up.  (It said something like "Thank
     you for trying #$@#%^%$#$".  Perhaps the copy I was using had
     garbled data; at any rate, the messages stopped once I had
     obtained a registered copy, as they're supposed to.)  This makes
     me scared of what else could get screwed up by such a program; if
     there is a bug or something it might go wild and start sending
     thousands of messages to Fido systems in Indonesia.  Thus, my
     Fidonews                     Page 3                   12 Jan 1987


     feelings about such devices are similar to my feelings about
     devious copy-protection schemes which do bizarre things to your
     disks.

     Unfortunately, since most Shareware users don't seem to be paying
     for the programs (even I was lazy about this for a while, but I
     have remedied it), devices like this might be necessary.  It's
     too bad.

     Speaking of Shareware, I have released a program, SCOREKPR, to
     let you keep an online, running scoreboard in your OUTSIDE
     section.  Version 2.00 has just been released, with several
     enhancements over earlier versions.  It is available for download
     on SOFT FIDO at (318) 636-4402.  There are no booby-traps to
     encourage payment of registration fees, but I hope you do send
     the requested contribution if you like the program and make
     regular use of it.

     Several games and other programs designed to work with SCOREKPR
     are also available for download.

                    Let's nominate Tom Jennings for New
                 PC World's Andrew Fluegelman Award - 1987


     In the January 1987 issue  of  PC  World  there  is  a  call  for
     nominations  for the First Annual Andrew Fluegelman Award - 1987.
     The purpose of the award "is given annually to encourage personal
     computer  software  excellence  and  to  recognize   a   software
     programmer  ....  We  are  looking  for  people  who  have made a
     substantial,  innovative contribution to  the  personal  computer
     community in commercial, shareware or public domain software."

     The  judging  of  the  award  "will be evaluated according to the
     following criteria:

        o It advances the state of the art of personal computing
        o It manifests innovation in concept and design
        o It demonstates orientation to personal computer users"


     I think this is a perfect opportunity for us,  the Fidonet nodes,
     to  get  Tom  Jennings  recognized  for  the  credit he so richly
     deserves.  While there have been many excellent software packages
     released to support or enhance FidoNet,  I feel Tom deserves  our
     nomination  since  he  originated the concept of linking bulletin
     boards together in a non-commercial network.  I feel that all  of
     the  above  criteria  are  meet from above.  If it wasn't for Tom
     taking  the  initial  plung,  we  would  be  1400  nodes  totally
     unassociated with each other.

     To  support  Tom,  please  feel  out the following form below and
     submit * five * copies to:

     Andrew Fluegelman Award
     Attention:Shirley Gines
     PCW Communications, Inc.
     501 Second Street
     San Francisco, CA 94107

     If you would prefer, complete the form in your word processor and
     send by netmail to 114/15 or 1/98 in the form of  a  file  attach
     where  XXXXYYYY.AWD  (XXXX/YYYY = Net/Node) and I will accumulate
     all submissions and send in bulk to PC  World.  Nominations  must
     be in by February 1, 1987.

     David Lescohier Fido 101/138



     Ron Bemis' latest gambit to extract money from hard working
     Fido Sysops could almost be described as a quasi trojan.  No
     one appreciates little features built into a piece of software
     that cause aggravation for the user.  Gee what's next, is he
     going to put a little routine in his next release that alters
     your user list if you don't pay him in a certain number of
     days?  The possibilities for punishing and harassing
     "freeloaders" are almost limitless.

     However, Ron's latest "Modest Innovation" raises more
     fundamental issues for the rapidly developing FidoNet System.
     Us participants, for the most part are hobbyists and amateurs
     who want to separate our FidoNet hobby from the mundane
     commercial realm in which most of us work most of the time.
     One of the attractions of FidoNet is that the participants, by
     joining and participating in the FidoNet and becoming members
     of the IFNA, become members of a fraternity of people who share
     a common interest in promoting telecommunications and providing
     a voluntary public service.

     The freedom from regulation, the opportunity to experiment and
     develop new concepts, techniques, extend the potential inherent
     in the telecommunication art is, I believe, threatened by
     attempts to commercialize FidoNet.  Sure there are obvious
     commercial applications of what we are doing.  I expect that
     FidoNet will be the inspiration for many commercial ventures.
     But I feel very strongly it should be understood, that the
     commercial applications should be spun off as a separate
     endeavor so that FidoNet, as such, remains strictly the domain
     of the amateur and hobbyist.  Otherwise, if we allow commercial
     interests, such as Ron Bemis is trying to promote, to encroach
     on Fidonet, then rapidly on his heels will follow all kinds of
     other interference in the form of regulations and restrictions.
     If this happens, our opportunity to innovate will inevitably
     be undermined, and as a result, one of the most important
     attractions of this hobby will be lost.  I write with some
     experience in Amateur Radio, a hobbyist fraternity which is
     constantly vigilant regarding commercial encroachment.

     I would like to suggest that Tom Jennings' policy should become
     a standard to which all those who write utilities for Fido
     should adhere:  If you are running a Board for public benefit,
     as a hobby, then the software is free.  If you are using Fido
     technology in order to earn money, then you should pay for the
     software.  Us members of the Net are providing Mr. Bemis a
     service by distributing his stuff.  He has the ingratitude to
     demand that we pay too.  That is how I feel.

     GAGS Shareware Status Report            January 1, 1987
     ----------------------------            ---------------


     by Mark J. Welch



     Frequently-asked question:   "Does Shareware work?"
     Answer:                      "It depends."


     Shareware has not worked for GAGS.

     I hope the following brief financial report on the Generic
     Adventure Game System (GAGS) will give people an idea of how
     Shareware has worked for me.

     GAGS is a text-adventure-game development system that runs on
     any MS-DOS/808x computer. It was developed over a six-month
     period and released on August 25, 1985; it has been upgraded
     six times since then; the current version is 1.06b.


     Expenses:
     ---------

     The expenses for GAGS include several publicity efforts,
     including press releases mailed to most major computer
     magazines, and phone expenses to distribute the program to
     many BBSs nationwide. Roughly half the program sales came
     directly from product write-ups in computer magazines (PC,
     MicroTimes, and IEEE Spectrum). I also ran a computer bulletin
     board from April 1985 through May 1986, and continue to run a
     private Fido/Seadog electronic-mail node; publicity through
     distribution of messages and in the FidoNews newsletter has
     been substantial but revenues from that avenue have been very
     slight. Expenses of update notices are also reflected.

     Table 1, below, shows a breakdown of expenses associated with
     development of the Generic Adventure Game System. Computer
     equipment shows most plainly in the expenses, with phone bills
     also quite high. Surprisingly low were postage expenses and
     actual "cost-of-goods sold." Unlike many other Shareware
     authors, I have spent no money on advertising. Total expenses
     over the past two years were $5,393.53.


     Income:
     -------

     Table 2, below, shows a breakdown of income by category. Disk
     sales are mostly to people who read about GAGS in magazines or
     somehow had trouble downloading it, since GAGS can be
     downloaded free from many BBSs and I charge a relatively high
     disk fee of $10 while also allowing user groups and many
     Fidonews                     Page 8                   12 Jan 1987


     commercial firms to sell GAGS on disk for under $7. Very few
     people who obtain the program register it, although I have
     recently had an upsurge in registrations from people who have
     downloaded GAGS from BBSs and, surprisingly, from BBS sysops
     themselves who use GAGS to provide on-line game-playing
     capabilities to users who may or may not have MS-DOS
     computers.  The $2,559.84 net income is roughly evenly divided
     among disk, registration, and source code payments.


     Results:
     --------

     As can be seen from Table 3, an initial substantial loss has
     been partially compensated for by a small profit in 1986. It's
     important to note that even the profits for 1986 end up
     valuing my time at a very low rate, even ignoring the actual
     development time.

     What next? About two months ago, I decided that the next
     version of GAGS will not be released as Shareware. Future
     versions of GAGS will be available only commercially:
     Shareware doesn't work. I plan to prepare a printed manual and
     make several enhancements to the program. I had intially
     planned to release the new version in February 1987, but will
     probably delay that release while I negotiate with several
     software publishers, since I would prefer not to publish the
     program myself. (Of course, no matter what happens, earlier
     versions of GAGS will still be available from BBSs and user
     groups, and a generous upgrade policy will be provided to
     registered users.)

     Comments are invited.

                   The National Genealogy Conference

     In the July 28, 1986 issue of FidoNews (Vol 3, No 29) I
     announced a new EchoMail conference devoted to genealogy.
     At that time there were only two nodes, myself and COMMSOFT
     BBS (143/26).  Since then, the conference has grown to 20
     nodes and acquired a new name: the National Genealogy
     Conference.

     Along the way, the NGC has become a clearinghouse for
     information on available genealogical software, both
     commercial and public domain, genealogical databases,
     hardware and, in general, has begun to focus the development
     of genealogical computing applications by bringing together
     widely separated researchers in a single forum.

     One of the most exciting developments was the decision, in
     October, by the National Genealogy Society Computer Interest
     Group to join the conference.  The principal genealogical
     computing interest group in the country, the NGS-CIG also
     operates the National Projects Registry, which is
     registering and coordinating all genealogically-related
     computerization projects in the country.

     Another important new member is Brian Mavrogeorge's ROOTS
     BBS (125/30) in San Francisco.  Brian is coordinator of the
     California Genealogical Society's Computer Interest Group
     and also SysOp of the oldest continuously operating
     genealogy BBS in the country (2 years this December).  Brian
     pioneered on-line searches of genealogical indexes on his
     board and switched from the RBBS format to join the
     conference.

     Searching your roots is a fascinating experience (even
     addictive), and now FidoNet is making it even more
     rewarding.  Give one of the boards below a call and check it
     out for yourself.

     Vernon E. Six, Jr.
     The Data Emporium BBS
     Fido 381/1 and 381/0

                  Fido's Home for Utilities and Software

          With  all due respect to Jerry Hindle,  I disagree with  his
     claim  to be "THE" Fido Software Distribution Node.   Although he
     was the first to publish his claim in FidoNews, I feel that there
     are at least two Distribution Nodes, Space Station Earth (Jerry's
     Board) and The Data Emporium BBS (my board).

          As  to who was the first or official one,  I don't know  (or
     care!).   I  will not argue over something like  this  especially
     when we are both trying to provide a much needed service, as this
     has never been my style.

          I  will,  however,  continue to promote Fido  Utilities  and
     Software in anyway I can I.E. Providing you access to them online
     on   your   first  call,   writing  reviews  like  this   article
     periodically, and any other way I can.

          Now  on  to  the  reviews.   This week I  will  discuss  two
     utilities.   The  first  is one called CHECK written  by  Michael
     Frye.  The second is one by Ron Bemis called Fifi.

          CHECK -- This program allows you to automatically check  the
     questionaire's ANSWERS.BBS file,  and process a user according to
     what it finds.

          If  a  blank  entry  is  found where  there  is  a  required
     response,  you  can  tell CHECK to reduce  the  user's  privilege
     level,  or remove him.   Likewise, if the user answers all of the
     required questions, it can raise the user's privilege.

          It  is  meant to be a tool in which you don't have  to  look
     over the questionaire and then use the sysop utility to deal with
     a  user.  In addition with versions 3.0 and later you can use  an
     optional  control  file  to further regulate the  users  on  your
     system.

          Of course, garbage answers can still be given in some cases,
     but  CHECK  can  help you automate some of  your  'housekeeping',
     either run manually or as a scheduled event.

          In this sysop's opinion, CHECK is something that should have
     been included in Fido in the first place.  I don't see how I ever
     got by without it.   You can download the latest version of CHECK
     from my board in Area 4 with the name of CHECK32.ARC.

          Keep up the good work, Mike.


          FIFI --  This program gives Fido the little "nudge" it needs
     to get going.

     Fidonews                     Page 13                  12 Jan 1987


          I  just hate calling a Fido BBS that makes me press <return>
     to  detect the baud rate.   Fifi solves this problem by answering
     the phone,  detecting the baud rate and then kicking Fido in  the
     bottom to get him going.

          Fifi  is my personal favorite Fido Utility.   And I am  VERY
     PROUD  to say,  that The Data Emporium BBS is the first  official
     registered user of Fifi.

          This  brings  up another point.   Alot of people  have  been
     talking about Ron's "canned" messages.  Yes, Fifi generates these
     messages,  but for the $20.00 requested registration, I can't see
     why  anyone  would  not register it,  or become  upset  with  the
     "canned" messages.   After all, they quit as soon as you register
     the program.

          I  have made arrangements with Ron to always have the latest
     version of Fifi on my board.  You can download it as FIFI34.ARC.

          Ron,  I can't wait to see what new features you come up with
     for Fifi.  Thanks a million!!!!



          Currently there are over two and one half megabytes of  Fido
     Utilities  and  Software  available  for  download  on  The  Data
     Emporium BBS.   The number is (915) 595-3896 if you would like to
     call  and download any.   I do not use SEADOG so unfortunately  I
     cannot respond to File Requests.  I do however use Server (if you
     have an account).

          If you are an author of Fido Utilities,  then please give me
     a call or use FidoMail, I would most definitely like to have your
     utilities.  If not, please upload any utilities that you may have
     that I do not (or leave me a message how I can get them).

     Mike J         150/900
     Randy Kobetich 150/130

                       - R U S H M A I L -

     Does your EchoMail conference take forever for a note to
     get from one end of the topology to the other?
     Well, have we got a deal for you!
     Now, with RushMail, you can cut the travel time in your
     conference by 1/2 or more.

     RushMail is not a program, just a clever application of
     Batch File wizardry and FidoNet Routing and Xternal events.
     It requires NO extra programs, (no SEAdog!) just your
     standard set of Fido and EchoMail programs.

     What RushMail does is this :

     first, an example EchoMail topology...
     (part of the East Coast star of SFFAN)

                       109/612
                          |
           150/900 --- 150/130 --- 150/150
                          |
                       129/17

     150/900 and 150/150 do RushMail, while 109/612 and 129/17
     do not.  150/130 is the echomail regional Star (the node
     that collects and redistributes the mail).

     Here's what happens in chronological order
     (i.e. schedule of events)
     ------------------------------------------

     1) Everyone does ScanMail (except the star, 150/130)

     2) The participating RushMail nodes (150/900 & 150/150) use
        a new mail schedule to transfer their mail to the star
        (150/130) and drop off their new echomail notes.

     3) The star (150/130) runs TossMail.  The RushMail nodes'
        notes are now in the star's message areas.

     4) The star (150/130) runs ScanMail.  The notes written on
        his BBS and the notes from the RushMail nodes
        (150/900 & 150/150) are included, since they are in his
        message areas.

     5) During the Main Mail Transfer Time (i.e. National Mail
        Hour for most nodes), mail is sent to and received from
        the non-RushMail nodes (109/612 & 129/17).
        All notes from the star (150/130) and the RushMail nodes
        (150/900 & 150/150) are all sent out at the same time.

     6) The star (150/130) runs TossMail.  All notes from the
     Fidonews                     Page 15                  12 Jan 1987


        non-RushMail nodes are now in the star's message areas.

     7) After a little trickery in the batch file (as will be
        shown later) an alternate AREAS.BBS file is used which
        only includes the RushMail nodes.

     8) After tricking the EchoMark with more batch-magic
        (also see later) the star does ScanMail, taking the
        non-RushMail nodes' new notes and generating copies for
        the RushMail nodes.

     9) After the Main Mail Transfer Time, another new small
        mail schedule is used, to transfer all new notes to the
        RushMail nodes.

     10) Everyone runs TossMail.  Voila!


     Effect : Same day mail transfer from RushMail nodes to
              everyone (150/900 to everyone getting mail from
              150/130) and same day delivery from non-RushMail
              nodes to the RushMail nodes (129/17 to the
              RushMail nodes).

              The time for non-RushMail node to another
              non-RushMail node is uneffected (2 days).

              No weird SEAdog/Fido incompatibilities arise
              because SEAdog is not necessary. (SEAdog can still
              be used for normal mail-transfer).


     What you need to do
     -------------------

     * For the Star (150/130) :

     Set up 2 new mail events -
         Mail Event 1) prior to running ScanMail
             mail from the RushMail nodes is transferred to the
             star (150/130)
         Mail Event 2) after the batch-magic and special
             ScanMail the new mail is transferred from the star
             (150/130) to the RushMail nodes

     Make a special AREAS.BBS file called AREAS.BBR which
     includes only the RushMail nodes.

     Add to your TossMail Xternal event in your RUNBBS batch
     file -

         TossMail (your parameters)
         cd \fido\msg\sffan   \  CD into each msg area and
         copy 1.msg 1.m        \ save the EchoMark so after
         cd \fido\msg\gaming   / ScanMail changes it in the
         copy 1.msg 1.m       /  2nd scanning for the
     Fidonews                     Page 16                  12 Jan 1987


                                 RushNodes, it's not lost for
                                 the non-RushNodes, so they
                                 get the new notes.
         ren areas.bbs areas.bbt  \  Move the normal AREAS.BBS
         ren areas.bbr areas.bbs  /  aside, and use the special
                                     Rush AREAS.BBR for the 2nd
                                     scan.
         ScanMail (your parameters as        > the 2nd scan
             used in your earlier ScanMail)
         ren areas.bbs areas.bbr  \  Put back the normal
         ren areas.bbt areas.bbs  /  AREAS.BBS.
         cd \fido\msg\sffan       \
         del 1.msg                 \ Get rid of the changed
         ren 1.m 1.msg              \EchoMarks and restore the
         cd \fido\msg\gaming        /correct one for the
         del 1.msg                 / for the non-RushNodes.
         ren 1.m 1.msg            /
         cd \fido                 \  Go back to Fido as usual.
         (back to Fido)...        /

     * For the RushNodes :

     Set up 2 new mail events -
         Mail Event 1) after running ScanMail, and before Main
           Mail Transfer Time mail from the RushMail nodes is
           transferred to the star (150/130)
         Mail Event 2) after Main Mail Transfer Time, and before
           running TossMail the new mail is transferred from the
           star (150/130) to the RushMail nodes

     * For the non-RushNodes :

     Business as usual.


     Higher Complexity Topologies
     ----------------------------

     For topologies of higher complexity, like Stars-on-a-
     string, RushMail can be used to an even higher
     effeciency.  Normally in RushMail, a star would consider
     its bordering stars as just RushNodes, except that mail
     would be both sent and received in both of the new
     mail events, instead of just sent in one and received in
     the other.

     Furthermore, more note travel time can be cut out if
     the stars did their 2nd mail transfer during the Main Mail
     Transfer Time (i.e. National Mail Hour for most nodes)
     instead of afterwards.  It would reduce the time for
     mail to get from a RushNode off of one star to a RushNode
     off another star to overnight, instead of taking 2 nights.
     Non-RushMail nodes would still remain uneffected, and
     no additional calls, beyond RushMail's two, would need to
     be made.

     Bullshit
     --------

     RushMail has proved very effective in keeping conferences
     (SFFAN, GAMING, INTERPER, MUSIC, and BUSINESS), very active
     due to faster responses cross-country between both RushNodes
     and non-RushNodes.

     And it doesn't cost a cent...

     Any questions should be directed to Mike J, 150/900.

     SEAdog, EchoMail, ScanMail, TossMail, are probably

     Announcing Diplomacy Game F3
     Robert Eskridge
     Fido 124/109

     The Russian and Turkish jaws are slowly crushing Germany and the
     remnants of the French army as Game F1 enters 1909.  In Game F2
     the Anglo-Prussian alliance is deadlocked against the
     Austro-Turkish conspiracy in early 1908.  These games are
     absorbing to those that need to grind a victory out of their
     position, but the rest of us need some excitement!  So for
     Diplomacy fans anywhere on the net we are pleased to announce:
