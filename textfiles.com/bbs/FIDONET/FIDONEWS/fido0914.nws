Editorial: Smaller but weirder

by Tom Jennings (1:1/1)

Smaller, but not very weird at all. Actually, quite quiet and
civilized. Which is however unusual.

It appears that there will be a FidoCon '92 after all. Since I hadn't
heard anything about it until the annoucement in this issue, I was
starting to wonder.

I promised to do all sorts of fun things this 'Snooze, but alas, I
flaked again. Actually, I've been working 70+ hours/week. I had two
days off, first free time in three weeks. Of course I didn't work on
FidoNews! So did I go to the beach? Lounge in our concrete patio with
cultivated weeds (not a joke)? Get plastered and stay out all night?

(FidoNet-news hungry readers can skip the rest of this editorial; it
is mere blabber.)

Nope. I revived some junk computers (IBM XT's, with cassette ports
even!), painted them fun colors, to give out to people who don't have
any. The more hardware-fetishistic amongst us will whine that giving
someone a PC1 is worse than no computer at all; I beg to differ. I
think most people grossly *over*estimate their hardware needs. And I
can tell you my smart and literate but non-techie friends generating
print publications with GEOWORKS are quite happy.

I am going to install modems in all of these machines I build ($40 for
2400 baud, from Fry Electronics). I've got a decent manual FidoNet
mailer cobbled from my Fido/FidoNet program, and by connecting their
box to the phone line they share with their roommates, can poll my
system (1:125/111) for mail whenever they get around to it. Some of
the mail is internet-gated files and news.

Worldnet, here we come...

A Proposal for Equitable Billing for Long Distance Echomail

Preamble:

The following document is a draft proposal on setting up a fair,
equitable and precise billing system for Fidonet hubs and nodes.

I have noticed since joining Fidonet, that there is one problem
that keeps rearing its ugly head; the sometimes barbaric
infighting that occurs between hubs and the nodes that it feeds
mail to. For the context of this document, mail will refer to
Netmail and Long Distance Echos. I have seen bitter fighting in
my home net (1:221/*) on more than one occasion concerning the
billing practices used by some hubs. I am not pointing my finger
at anyone in particular here, but this problem is one that will
not go away unless comprehensive steps are taken to ensure that
*everyone* receives fair and equitable treatment.

One practice that has always puzzled me is nodes polling hubs
for mail. To me, this seems just a tad silly. I think that is
would be far more logical for the person that has the mail to
call the person who wants to receive that mail. For example, the
person from whom I get my long distance echos (a local call for
me) calls long distance to pick-up the mail. He starts his poll
at about 3:00 a.m. hoping that the hub he is feeding from has
actually managed to get through to his feed by then. His system
then proceeds to dial the hub's number in the hope that the line
will be available sometime before 8:00 a.m., at which time his
system quits trying because the phone rates have gone up.

Now, there is to my eye, two things wrong with the above senario.

1). If the system my hub is trying to call has not received the
mail from from his feed, then my hub has wasted a long distance
call. Not only that, he didn't get the mail. Nor is his system
going to try again until the next day; he only polls his hub
once per twenty-four hour period. The net result is: I don't get
my mail for at least another twenty-four hours. I find this to
be a messy arangement at best.

2). If the system my hub is trying to call has a busy signal
right up till 8:00 a.m., then my hub's system gives up because
of the raise in the phone rates. The net result is the same as
the above example; I don't get the mail for at least another
twenty-four hours. Not only that, the system my hub is trying to
call may be nuking packets that are not picked up on time. I am
not sure if this is the case in my own hub-hub-node system, but
I have heard of such things happening.

FidoNews 9-14                  Page 3                       6 Apr 1992


The Proposal:

Part 1:

I propose that the systems that have the mail do the calling.

This is a pretty simple thing to implement I would think. For
example, when 1:12/12 get the mail in from 1:13/13 then 1:12/12
would start calling the hubs that are feeding from him (I am
going to use the word him to mean him/her/it/etc.).

Notice first off that the problem of timing is eliminated. The
hubs that usually poll 1:12/12 do not have to worry about
getting a window into 1:12/12. They also do not have to worry
about whether or not there is actually anything there to pick up
when they do call. Right away we have eliminated the sometimes
convulted problem of setting up times for all the systems to
call that poll 1:12/12 for mail.

Now then, after 1:12/12 has called to the system that feeds my
hub, that system will start calling the systems that feed from
him. Now my hub does not have to worry about when to call,
whether there is mail there to collect, or the ever present busy
signal.

This is obviously a simplistic example. I think that is does
serve to show how this proposal could be put into effect though.

Part 2:

That hubs and nodes should be charged exactly what it costs to
pass the mail to/from them.

Presently, in the area I am in, nodes are generally charged a
flat rate by their hub for mail service. In some cases, the hub
is losing money on this deal. Not only that, some nodes (which
carry only a few LD echos) are subsidising other nodes (those
who carry *alot* of LD echos). I find this system to be unfair
to both the hub and the nodes who carry only a few LD echos.

Bu implementing the proposals in Part 1, an accurate billing
system could be brought forward. In order for this system to
work, a few things will have to taken for granted.

1). That *all* hubs have a least a 9600 v32bis modem. I know
that this is asking alot. However, someone who is feeding more
than one or two nodes *should* have one. If the hub is not in a
position to purchase the modem, then *perhaps* the nodes that
are feeding from him should collectivly purchase one. This would
mean of course that if the hub should move or stop hubbing that
the modem would be transferred to the replacement hub. Also,
modem prices are now dropping like the proverbial rock.

FidoNews 9-14                  Page 4                       6 Apr 1992


2). That *all* hubs have AreaFix and Raid working smoothly on
their systems. This is a given on most hubs, but not all.

3). Once a month the hub will have to figure out exactly what
to charge each hub/node that is feeding from him (based I
suppose on what he had to pay to get the mail in that they are
getting from him, as well as what he had to pay to send it to
them).

This may be the hardest part of this proposal to implement. I do
however think that there is someone in Fidonet that can come up
with a piece of software to aid in this part. Billing would be
done on a cost/connect time/transfer rate ratio (or something
better if anyone can think of it).

This practice will allow hubs/nodes to pay for exactly what they
are getting. No longer will the little guy be paying for the
excesses of the big guy. Sysops who are echomail fanatics (yes,
I am one too) will pay for the pleasure of reading all those LD
echos.

4). In order to facilitate an orderly transfer of funds, a
monthly budget figure could be arrived at (much like the way
Union Gas works their monthly budget plan). Payment would be
made in advance for at least three months to the hub you are
feeding from. By using the software mentioned in the above
section, tri-monthly adjustments to the budget amounts could be
initiated. The software could also send a monthly netmail
message to the hub/node showing exactly what costs were
incurred. I would expect that after a "warm-up" period,
hubs/nodes would have a fairly reasonable idea of what costs
they can expect to pay. Also, the three month miminum advance
payment will discourage those SysOps who are trying to get
someting for nothing.

Postamble:

I realize that this document is very likely to receive alot of
negative feedback.

If the feedback is constructive critisism, then I welcome it.

If however, people dismiss it out of hand, I will have to wonder
what their motives are. The only people who are going to be hurt
by implementing this proposal are those people who are running
systems that are leeching off the good nature of their hubs.
These people probably won't be too happy with the prospect of
having to pay for all that LD echomail. On the other hand, those
people who only get LD echos that they or their users actually
read are most likely to welcome this change in billing
procedures.

FidoCon '92 Selection Results
Zone 1 Region Coordinators
Zone 1 Zone Coordinator

The 1992 FidoCon site selection process has concluded and we
are pleased to announce that the Ron Bemis/Dallas Texas
proposal garnered the majority of votes.

The results were :

    Bemis/Dallas          7 votes
    Henderson/New Jersey  3 votes
    Travis/Denver         0 votes
                         --------
                         10 votes is 100% participation.

We congratulate the winners,  which include members of Nets
124 and 130, and we really shouldn't consider the others as
having lost, as they submitted fine proposals, and in the
case of the Travis/IBECC conference, while not flying the
FidoCon flag, will certainly be a good event.  The Henderson/
New Jersey has lost two years running, but we hope that
option returns for next year.

We would also like to apologize for the far too optimistic
schedule set to select from amoungst the proposals.  We took
a week's delay to wait for more proposals and an additional
two weeks to allow time for more feedback from regional
sysops to their respective RCs.  We all felt this was necessary.

FidoCon tradition has put the selection of next years Fidocon
( which will be Fidocon '93 ) at this years event, so get those
proposal pens out and start planning.

And without further delay, the winning proposal :

Hello you out there! The following is a comment triggered by a comment
Tom Jennings made in Fnews 912 about Zone 2. Among other words, he
wrote:

> of the lists. If the worst happens, as it appears is about to in zone

I understand that there's almost no idea outside Zone 2 about what's
going on in there, except muffled rumours. I'd like to clarify the
situation, or at least say how _I_ see it from my place. Well, some
might wonder why the only defence for the whole zone comes from xUSSR
- hmm, I don't know. It's always so in unfair arguments - the right
side prefers to be silent, and those wrong are shouting the most.

Okay, let's go on with the story. What it all started with, our
previous esteemed ZC, Felix Kasza, did resign. The reasons for that is
a separate story, so I will not embark on that. Suffice to say, he was
good ZC, and we all owe him a lot (literally, too - he has paid out of
his own pocket for many, many mails). Then Ron Dwight stepped in. What
he had to begin with, there was no Santa Klaus delivering mail to
regions on his dime, and many people DID have to do something on their
own. The growling began, but invisible as yet. But what really started
the thing, it was simple _suggestion_ ZC made in ENET.SYSOP (Zone 2
sysop echo) that nodelist size can be somewhat reduced with _small_
efforts from *Cs doing their job more thoroughly (well, Tom, noone
complains about big nodelist, but what if it can _really_ be made less
in size without anyone hurt?). Noone was FORCED to do anything or
threatened with anything. It was a _suggestion_. Anyone having reading
skills above such of 7 age old kid could prove that reading Ron's
messages. But the hounds were off the leash. Since that, Ron is
receiving such an amount of bashing, kicking, and outright insults,
that it's a pain just to read ENET.SYSOP. The story continues, but I
don't want to bore you readers with details. If some people  will
write me and tell  they're interested, I can try and make some mor e
reports on the Zone 2, if noone of its sysops don't care <wicked
grin>.

FidoNews 9-14                  Page 8                       6 Apr 1992


So the abstract is: please don't believe when you're being told about
Zone 2 tiranny - IT DOESN'T EXIST. What does exist, it is stout ZC,
trying to make Fidonet Zone 2 better, looking into the future and not
in his pocket or list of political opponents.

                             SEAmail 1.10
                              Revision E

Revision E to SEAmail version 1.10 is now available, and incorporates
the following changes:

 *  Null modem connections tended to loop thinking that they had an
    incoming call.  This has now been fixed.

 *  A new "Print wide" option has been added to MAIL to allow printing
    messages on wide (132 column) printer paper.

 *  An error condition (i.e. "bug") in Novell Netware has been
    detected that would erroeously caused LANMAIL to think that it had
    a resource deadlock.  We have changed LANMAIL to work around this
    problem.

 *  Non-networked multiline OS/2 systems were operating in a non-
    optimal fashion due to the lack of datagram support for
    interprocess communication.  We have modified our stub NETAPI.DLL
    dynalink to correct this situation.

 *  CFGEDIT has been modified to allow for giving a long distance
    dialing suffix (i.e. a credit card number) as part of the "/D"
    command line switch.  In addition, a selection for "dial 9 for
    everything" was added, and the "direct outside line" selection was
    moved to the top of the list.

 *  A condition was corrected that could occasionally cause a "divide
    by zero" error during a file transfer.

 *  A bug was corrected that could cause numerous GroupMail archives
    to be sent erroneously in response to a file request.



Anyone with SEAmail version 1.10 revision D can upgrade their system
free of charge by going into their SEAmail directory and issuing the
command:

    upgrade sm110e

Those with the OS/2 version should type:
