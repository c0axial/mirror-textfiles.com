                          Zones, Zones, Zones...

     I was reading the article about Zone 3 defecting, and you know,
     he's right!  This fidonet shouldn't all be run by Zone 1, I
     don't think it's fair.  I think all Zone coordinators and
     echomail coordinators should have a say in the echopol and
     Policy5 (when it's finished)  Because you keep approving things
     with little consideration for other zones.  They're going to
     break away soon if we don't let them share.  Americans think "Oh,
     our country's the best there is, that means all of fidonet's
     rules have to be made here, we should never consider what other
     countries think!".  Heck, it's not even ZONE 1, it's only the
     U.S., because Canada has no say either, or little say at all.  I
     think we should have a hiearchy with some sense!  I think there
     should be something to the sort of International Coordinator -->
     Zone Coordinator --> COUNTRY coordinator --> regional coordinator
     --> Net coord.  I also think that the International Coordinator
     should act as president and the zone and country coordinators
     act like congress ( from a USA viewpoint, prime minister,
     parlement, what have you).  So Echopol and PolicyX can get voted
     on, but the catch is, the IC can rarely veto anything decided on
     by the two houses of congress.  That's the way my letter stands,
     and that's the way it will remain...

     From the Horse's Mouth Dept., Addendum --

     As mentioned last time, there are a bunch of niceties I would
     like to see in the 2.50 release of Binkleyterm.  I just heard
     another couple :

        5. use MaxTime parm for incoming file requests,
        6. TAB key on ALT-S file name completes file name
           ( or not if the file doesn't exist )

     Binkley's configuration parameters include three sets of
     incomming file request 'limiters', for example :

        ProtReqList    c:\opus\okfile.lst
        ProtReqLim     10
        ProtMaxBytes   1000000

     These specify the available files, count of files and total size
     of files that will be sent to a node who connects with a
     password protected session.

     The problem with the setup I've shown is that an incomming 14.4k
     bps connection may use 15 minutes to get the byte limit, where
     as a 2400 bps connection might use AN HOUR.  As a local mail
     hub, ( and owner of a high speed modem ), I don't want the
     board tied up for an hour.

     A parameter for the maximum minutes, such as

         ProtMaxTime  20

     would enable me to set the MaxBytes parms high and not worry
     about tying up the board.  The transmit time value would be
     checked before each file is sent ( file size * 8 / bps rate )
     and compared to the MaxTime value remaining ( MaxTime - session
     time ).

     You know it's a fabulous thing to have the source code for a
     program you use everyday.


     Timing is Everything --

     Have you ever looked at your BBS configuration and compared the
     download limit to the time allowed ?  Do you enforce a download
     limit per day ?  Do you enforce an upload/download ratio ?

     One sure way to receive junk uploads ( thereby creating extra
     sysop work ) is to enforce a up/down transfer ratio.  I suggest
     that using a time limit, and letting the user use the time
     anyway he/she wants is the cleanest way to insure that uploads
     you do receive are worthwhile.

     I think Socrates said "One DOS utility is worth a thousand
     echomail messages." He also might have said "Be excellent to
     one another." I think.


     Christmas in Daneland --

     Last Sunday, I got Honey and Kevin routed off to Daneland for
     the holidays.  I thought it was a bit early myself, but the
     official explanation was that Kevin was going to learn a lot of
     Danish.  They plan to stay for 6 weeks !

     So then, they hang out in Frankfurt for a few days waiting on
     some hot RENTAL CAR to zoom up to DK in.  Holy sphincter
     tightener!

     I'll be heading over in a couple of weeks.  We use "Daddy's"
     flight coupons to get from Dallas to Frankfurt. I think one of
     her girlfriends in Frankfurt is going up about the time I need
     a ride...  Otherwise, it's the train for me.


     So We Want a Baby --

     And it ain't happening, you know.  So I get this doctor's
     appointment and you know I hate clinics.  And they have to get
     this SPERM sample, so I'm given this jar and the nurse shows me
     to a small room and hands me a magazine.  Yeah, right, and I'm
     in there for HOURS...

     So, you know, I wear out my right arm, and I wear out my left
     arm, and I'm running warm water on it, and beating it against
     the sink...  and I just can't the lid off that jar !
