                            Order versus Orders

     I ran across an interesting quote lately that I'd lake  to  share
     with  you.  I'm sure that the author didn't have anything like us
     in mind,  but what he has to say may well apply to us better than
     many would think.

         "In  the  world  of  daily life,  the world which we perforce
         inhabit,  there is much talk about order,  particularly  from
         statesmen  and politicians.  They tend,  however,  to confuse
         order  with  orders,  just  as  they  confuse  creation  with
         regulations.  Order,  I  suggest,  is  something evolved from
         within,   not  imposed  from  without;   it  is  an  internal
         stability,  a vital harmony, and, in the social and political
         category,  it has never existed except for the convenience of
         historians."

                     E. M. Forster


     We  have  more  than  our share of "statesmen and politicians" in
     amateur networking.  I can say with some confidence (having  been
     there,  as  you know) that most,  if not all,  of them are acting
     from a sense of what they feel is right.  We've all  seen  plenty
     of  people  shouting about "control!  control!  control!" (though
     never with  a  good  explanation  about  why  anyone  would  WANT
     control)  that  we're probably all sick of the subject.  But what
     gets lost in all the noise and smoke is that many  people  see  a
     need for some sort of order, some sort of organization, some sort
     of overall plan to keep everything working.

     The  problem  is  that  sysops  are not temperamentally suited to
     anything of the sort.  Trying to organize sysops  would  be  like
     trying to organize anarchists (or perhaps worse).  Let's face it,
     one  of  the  "bennies"  in being a sysop is the feeling of total
     control over your own board and hence your  own  destiny.  Sysops
     will not give that up lightly, or without a fight.  Sysops expect
     to be, and DEMAND to be, independant.

     We  are,  to  a  large  extent,  saddled  with  a  basic  network
     technology that implies a large amount  of  central  organization
     and  control.  Someone has to keep that nodelist accurate,  after
     all!  But fortunately,  mechanisms are evolving  to  give  sysops
     back  a  lot of the independence that joining a network took away
     from them.  To name two prominent examples:

     FidoNews 8-01                Page 2                    7 Jan 1991


      1) Domain  addressing technology;  Many sysops are in it for the
         netmail.  Domain addressing makes it  possible  (easy,  even)
         for  many  disparate networks to co-exist peacefully.  Domain
         addressing makes it easy for multiple amateur networks to co-
         exist and share mail, which in turn allows the sysop to "shop
         around" for one or more networks that suit his  needs  and/or
         desires.  We  no  longer  live  in a world of "one FidoNet --
         Love it or go away!" If you don't like it,  there are  plenty
         of alternatives.

      2) GroupMail  conferencing;  Most  sysops  are  in  it  for  the
         conferences.   But  echomail  technology   presupposes   (and
         generally  demands)  that  all  participants  are in the same
         network.  Worse than that  --  it  predates  zone  and  point
         addressing  and thus presupposes that everyone is in the same
         zone!  This  is  manifestly  untrue  even  in  the  "FidoNet"
         network, and last time I checked this one assumption was good
         for  a rousing argument among the various developers any time
         it was mentioned.  GroupMail,  on the other  hand,  makes  no
         such assumption.  As long as your system knows where to get a
         conference  from and where to send any messages you may have,
         it'll all work.

     This really ought to be the  model  for  future  amateur  network
     software  development,  not  to mention the development of future
     social structures to deal with interactions between sysops.  What
     types of organization that can work with sysops realistically are
     those which:

      a) Allow sysops to maintain their own freedoms of choice and of
         personal destiny, and

      b) Provide sysops with significant benefits observably in excess
         of anything they may have to give up to attain them.

     I used to believe in intangibles.  I don't  anymore.  Sysops  are
     not  going to go along with anything that they (we) do not see as
     providing a solid, real, practical benefit on a day to day basis.
     The proposed gateway policy is an excellent  counter-example.  On
     the one hand it is remarkably easy to ignore, and on the other it
     provides  no  obvious  benefit  to the sysop who follows it.  The
     proposed echomail policy is similar  for  similar  reasons.  Even
     the  current  Policy4  document  in  many places goes outside the
     bounds of anything that the average sysop can see any benefit to.

     ALL policy statements in ALL amateur  networks  need  to  realize
     what  their  intended  audience  will or will not accept,  and be
     written accordingly.  By and large,  sysops are going to do  what
     they're  going  to  do,  and  if anyone tells them to do anything
     else, they'll either be ignored, sidestepped, or avoided.

     FidoNews 8-01                Page 3                    7 Jan 1991


     In time social mechanisms will evolve to deal  with  issues  that
     are  important to sysops in ways that sysops will accept.  And in
     a little more time those methods  will  be  documented.  But  the
     documents  that will work,  that will be meaningful and accepted,
     will not be like Policy4 or the gateway policy or  echopol.  They
     will   not   be  imposed  from  without  by  a  few  well-meaning
     individuals.   They  will  be   more   like   Policy3   and   its
     predecessors;  they will be written to document existing practice
     as sysops have already worked out among themselves.

        While  the  number  of  people  committed  to animal rights is
     growing every day, many people are unaware of how humans  exploit
     animals for their own gain or  goals, or they do not know  how to
     successfully initiate effective changes for the animals.

        Animal activists are needed to factually inform the public  of
     atrocities  being  inflicted  on   animals  in  the   scientific,
     commercial, and entertainment fields, as well as by  individuals,
     but  unfortunately,  the  public's  image  of  the average animal
     activist is with a spray can  of paint in one hand and  a shotgun
     in the other.   This image needs  to be changed,  for it is  only
     through  rational,  calm  and  non-violent discourse that changes
     take place.  While emotionalism, self-righteousness, and  demands
     for instant changes may make the individual feel better,  animals
     are still being painfully exploited, tortured and killed.

        While  picketing  a  company  that  tests  their  products  on
     animals  attracts  attention,  effective  changes  can take place
     through such  activities as  writing protest  letters, joining an
     animal  rights  groups  whose  philosophies  you  agree with, and
     refusing  to  purchase  products  that  are  tested  on  animals.
     Withholding your consumer dollars  sends a strong message  to the
     companies that you don't want their products tested on animals.

        The purpose of the ANIMAL_RIGHTS CONFERENCE is to educate  and
     to be a forum for the exchange of ALL viewpoints and opinions  on
     the issue  of animal  rights as  well as  suggesting ways  to get
     involved with the animal rights  movement.  Animal rights is  not
     only  about  medical  research,  but  it  also encompasses animal
     cruelty  and  exploitation  from  the  clothing  industry  to the
     entertainment field to the  pet trade, and discussions  regarding
     all aspects  of animal  rights should  take place.   All sides of
     this  emotional  issue  need  to  be  represented,  so I urge all
     users, whether  pro or  con on  the animal  rights issue, to join
     this conference and freely express  their opinions.  I also  urge
     all  sysops   to  consider   carrying  this   conference.     The
     Animal  Rights  conference  is  listed  in  ELIST,  and available
     from the FidoNet BackBone as ANIMAL_RIGHTS.

                                       Thank you.

                            FIDONET IN 1991

     Well, here we are at the start of a new year.  What will 1991
     bring for Fidonet?

     This could turn out to be an interesting year.  Perhaps the
     biggest event may go almost unnoticed by most.  It came in the
     form of a news release from the Federal Communications
     Commission:

                             December 13, 1990

      FCC ESTABLISHES NEW CODELESS CLASS OF AMATEUR OPERATOR LICENSE
                             (PR DOCKET 90-55)

          The Commission has revised the examination requirement for
     the Technician Class operator license, thereby creating a new
     codeless class of amateur operator license.  After these
     revisions have become effective, an examinee will not be required
     to prove that he or she can send and receive texts in Morse code
     telegraph signals to qualify for a Technician Class amateur
     operator license.

          The amateur service currently consists of five classes of
     licenses having increasing privileges and each being
     progressively more difficult to obtain.  The classes are Novice,
     Technician, General, Advanced, and Amateur Extra.

          The FCC noted that offering a codeless class of license that
     authorizes control operator privileges at stations which transmit
     exclusively above 30 MHz, provides an entry level opportunity to
     otherwise qualified persons who find telegraph a barrier to
     pursuing the purposes of the amateur service.

          Therefore, the FCC has established the Technician Class as
     the codeless class of license.  This license includes all amateur
     privileges above 30 MHz.  The Commission also amended the rules
     to grandfather frequency privileges below 30 MHz to current
     Technician Class licensees.

          In addition, the Commission decided to retain the Novice
     Class operator license in order to provide an alternate entry
     level operator license opportunity to persons who desire to
     pursue the purpose of the amateur service and who can pass a
     telegraphy requirement in place of the more comprehensive written
     examination requirement for the codeless Technician Class
     operator license.

          Action by the Commission December 13, 1990, by Report and
     Order (FCC 90-///).  Commissioners Sikes (Chairman),

                               -FCC-
     [end of news release]

     What does this mean, and why is it important?  Well, for the
     first time folks in the United States will be able to get into
     the hobby of amateur radio without taking a morse code test.
     It is impossible to know how many will take advantage of this
     opportunity, but it could make a difference if those with an
     interest in technology are drawn into amateur radio.  As you
     are probably aware, amateur packet radio technology allows data
     communication via radio that are very similar in many ways to
     what we do via phone lines.

     I'm not an amateur (not yet, anyway), but as I see it there are
     four noteworthy things to keep in mind about amateur radio:

     1) They use protocols similar to those used by the Internet
     (e.g. AX.25 which is a takeoff on the X.25 protocol).  Thus,
     folks who get into amateur radio will probably be more at home
     in the UseNet environment than in Fidonet.

     2) There are no long distance charges in amateur radio.  Thus,
     it may have great appeal to those in rural areas.  Those using
     amateur radio for data transmission need not be quite so
     concerned with shaving every last byte off of a transmission in
     order to save phone charges (I'm not saying that efficient
     protocols should not be used, but it's simply not going to be
     quite as big a concern).  The fact that phone charges are not
     an issue may mean that there are fundamental differences in the
     way traffic is moved via amateur radio.

     3) No commercial traffic may be carried over amateur radio.
     Thus, certain types of conferences that are routinely carried
     on Fidonet could not be carried via amateur radio (at least not
     without significant changes in content).

     4) Again, I must point out that I'm not an amateur, but it
     seems that one of the problems with amateur radio is that many
     hams seem to want to talk only about amateur radio, and nothing
     else!  We have those types in Fidonet, too, of course - the
     folks that participate only in the computer- and
     communications-oriented conferences.  But in Fidonet, there are
     conferences on a fairly wide range of other subjects as well.
     I'm not sure if amateur radio has this diversity now, but if it
     doesn't it probably will.

     Those of you that are hams may find some glaring errors in what
     I've stated above; if so, please understand that I don't claim
     any expertise on the subject.  My only point in commenting on
     this at all is to point out that while amateur radio will never
     completely replace Fidonet, it could certainly affect us.
     Indeed, it has already (some have commented that the now
     defunct IFNA [International FidoNet Association] was intended
     FidoNews 8-01                Page 7                    7 Jan 1991


     to be to Fidonet what the ARRL [American Radio Relay League] is
     to amateur radio.  Since the ARRL seems to be the organization
     that many hams "love to hate", I'd say that IFNA at least
     partially achieved its goal!).  But now that the psychological
     barrier of the code has been removed, it's quite possible that
     many more of the technologically-knowledgeable people in
     Fidonet will be inspired to bone up on small amount of
     electronic theory knowledge required to get a ham license.
     This cross-pollination of the two technologies could ultimately
     affect us in ways we don't yet realize.

     The technology used in Fidonet is badly in need of overhaul.
     The software we use for moving echomail is based on a
     technology developed when there were only a few nodes in
     Fidonet with any interest in the concept of echomail.  It
     simply is not an adequate design for a network that has
     literally thousands of nodes participating.  In addition, it
     makes no provision for fully-moderated conferences, wherein a
     message entered in any conference is first sent to the
     conference moderator for possible review before being sent out
     to everyone else.  Fidonet technology does not support this,
     and to my knowledge is the ONLY major conference mail type
     system that does not.  This makes it difficult for us to
     properly gate conferences from other networks that do have this
     feature (in particular, moderated newsgroups from UseNet) and
     as a result, we miss out on a lot of useful information.

     Since UseNet has obviously superior conferences to Fidonet (or
     so I'm told by everyone I've ever met that's been exposed to
     both), I think Fidonet is either going to interconnect with
     UseNet or die.  There is already software available for both
     the IBM and Amiga platforms (and possibly others) that can
     handle UseNet conferences in their native format, so if Fidonet
     is unable to gate conferences to UseNet we may start seeing
     Fidonet nodes leave the network in order to run software that
     has full UseNet capability.

     Unfortunately, it seems that one of the things that Fidonet
     software developers do best is argue with each other.  In the
     last year or so we've seen software hit the network that is
     only partially Fidonet compatible (or with other programs
     already in common use in the net), and this has caused problems
     in the net.  Those of you who read some of the conferences that
     I participate in are probably fed up by now with my occasional
     diatribes on the FTSC [Fidonet Technical Standards Committee]
     but the point is that we need some type of organization in
     Fidonet that can perform two functions:

     1) Identify software that purports to be compliant with Fidonet
     standards but which is not, and publish a list of the actual
     deficiencies in such software (both as a way to encourage
     software authors to fix the problems, and to warn potential
     users of the problems they might expect).  This would be more
     of a "consumer report" type function than an attempt to "ban"
     non-compliant software from the network (personally, I'd be in
     favor of the latter in some circumstances, but many seem to

     fear that if an actual ban were proposed then legal action
     could result.  But the last I knew, you could still review
     products, and offer reviews and comparative reports without
     getting sued, and a report that a certain product does not seem
     to adhere to Fidonet technical standard FTS-nnnn would
     certainly be useful information to have).

     2) Move the process of development of new standards forward by
     actually setting dates for comment periods, then (when
     appropriate) holding votes on the proposals received.  As it
     is, some of the discussions in NET_DEV and similar software
     development echoes drag on for literally MONTHS with nothing
     resembling agreement being reached.  It's no wonder that
     software developers go out and "do their own thing" because
     there really is no functional formal mechanism by which new
     standards can be proposed, considered, commented and voted
     upon, and then formally adopted (or rejected).

     It appears that the FTSC doesn't see itself in this role...
     instead, the present chairman seems to see the FTSC's role more
     as one of simply collecting and distributing documents (and
     occasionally making declarations to the effect that existing
     standards are "cast in stone" and cannot ever be changed... or
     at least that's the impression I'm left with).

     Yet in my opinion, the lack of any organization that performs
     the above-mentioned functions in Fidonet is what has caused
     software development in Fidonet to grind to a snail's pace.  If
     the FTSC doesn't want to perform these functions, then perhaps
     we should set up some organization that will.

     Or, maybe we should just throw our hands up and say that
     Fidonet is total anarchy and it's only pure dumb luck if your
     mailer can talk to my mailer, or your echomail processor can
     properly unpack and toss bundles created by my echomail
     processor.  Because, folks, that's just about where we're
     headed now.

     Please don't get me wrong, I DON'T want to see another IFNA
     formed.  All I want is to see some way to promulgate new
     Fidonet TECHNICAL standards, and to possibly identify software
     that is deficient in meeting those standards.  Just that,
     nothing more.

     Once we have a way to get new standards formally adopted, then
     we can really get to work on a superior method of conference
     distribution...  one that is impervious to "dupe" messages,
     that does not contain ten or twelve lines of SEEN-BY's, and
     that allows (but DOES NOT REQUIRE) conferences to be truly
     fully moderated.  (For those who may be wondering - yes, I'm
     quite familiar with GroupMail, but for whatever reason, it's
     simply not being widely used in Fidonet at the present time.
     This article is already pretty long so I'm not going to comment
     on that situation now).  We can also finally settle on a new
     nodelist format that not only contains more information, but
     that also uses a more efficient format for update (DIFF) files.
     FidoNews 8-01                Page 9                    7 Jan 1991


     And that's only a couple of the things that need to be
     accomplished.

     Nothing lasts forever, of course, and eventually Fidonet will
     be just a memory anyway, but we can hasten that day by
     providing an atmosphere where technical stagnation is the rule.
     The bright and gifted among us will eventually figure out that
     their talents can be put to better use in other areas, where
     there is not so much uncertainty abounding (and fewer folks
     ready to flame them at every turn!).

     Well, that's my opinion, anyway.  Hope 1991 is a good year for
     all of you!

     Node 1:231/0

     The first issue of the third volume of the Fidonet Ham/Packet
     Digest is just around the corner.  I have been compiling these
     Digests now for just about two years.

     I'd like to thank the readership for all of the fine input that
     I have received over the last two years.  I have received survey
     sheets from all over the Fidonet world (when's that lunar node
     going online anyway?) and that is the encouragement I need to
     keep cranking the things out.

     If you are interested in Amateur Radio, then the "Digest" is for
     you.  It is a compilation of notes and news culled from numerous
     online sources from all over the world.  With the new "No Code"
     Technician license finally becoming a reality, I am sure we will
     see the ranks of radio amateurs swell.

     A big thanks to Tom Jennings for giving me permission to use the
     term FIDONET in the masthead.  Since most of the information in
     the Digest comes from the Ham and Packet echo mail areas, it
     just makes sense.  There is no charge for the Fidonet Ham/Packet
     Digest, and there is not to be any charge for distributing the
     files to other systems. In other words, this information is to
     be freely distributed.

     A new "digest" has now been placed under construction to cater
     to the shortwave listeners in the network.  The name of this new
     publication is "Shortwave Schedule Digest" as it is a
     compilation of the latest and most up to date english broadcast
     schedules that I can find.  This newsletter will be published on
     a every other month basis.

     The first issue is now available for file request. Just ask for:

     SKED0101.ARC

     The Ham/Packet Digest is also available.  The latest issue is:

     HAM0211.ARC (Vol 2 No. 11)

     All comments/articles can be submitted to Brian Murrey via
     netmail to 1:231/0, 1:231/30 or to MURREY on GEnie.

                           The Year in Review
                           by  Kwityer Bychin
                        ------------------------

     Hi Ho, folks. The first Snooze of '91!  Are  we  impressed  or
     WHAT?? Another year of useless,  mindless  drivel  distributed
     all over the globe. Especially when one of MY articles  is  in
     it.

     So, let's start the new year off right by  rehashing  some  of
     the things that really got us all riled up in '90. Sound good?
     Hey, the holidays are OVER. No more fun and merriment. Time to
     get p.o.'d at me  again.  That  is,  after  all,  my  JOB  you
     know...

     Let's see... Ok, I'm not going to go in  chronological  order,
     because I either don't remember the  dates,  or  they  weren't
     important, or both. So here we go...

     One  of  the  significant  events  of  1990  was  the   Snooze
     changing its compression format to LHarc. Boy, we sure  had  a
     lot of fun with that one! Crybabies 'round  the  world  wailed
     and stomped their feet, held their breath, and puked  strained
     peas all over Vince Perrier and Lighthorse Harry Lee for  that
     stunt. Blood-curdling cries of "WAAAA!!  YOU  BROKE  MY  BATCH
     FILE" were heard all over Fight-O-Net. Geez, gimme a break.

     Then there was FidoCon '90 or  Conclave  '90  or  whatever  it
     was called. Lotsa interesting  stuff  went  down  there.  IFNA
     packed it in, Big fight about whether AlterNet sysops  got  or
     didn't get a $50 break, The keynote address lasted  about  six
     days, during which, some guy dressed in a Santa  Claus  outfit
     started laughing  uncontrollably  while  everyone  kinda  just
     looked at him ... Some drunk planted some rebel newsletters in
     a few magazines ... Hotel had to be evacuated because the  air
     conditioning caught fire  ....  Noone  attended  "The  Fidonet
     Meeting"... you had to be there, it was fun.

     GEORGE  PEACE  became  Z1C.  Echopol  followed  a  few  months
     later. Think there's a connection there?

     The International Coordinator  (aka  The  BIG  DOG),  came  up
     with this thing called GATEPOL, which noone had heard of,  and
     paid no attention to ...

     Mahatma Ravsik broke the single-conference posting  record  by
     posting  approximately  six  billion  messages  in  the  SYSOP
     conference ...

     Front Door 1.99c came out early in the  year,  minus  SEAlink,
     plus a new handshake called EMSI,  Which  stands  for  Eat  My
     Shorts, Idiot ...

     FidoNews 8-01                Page 12                   7 Jan 1991


     Ed McMahon (a.k.a. The Sweepstakes Fairy) was on TV  every  12
     seconds seconds plugging the American Family Sweepstakes.  Top
     Prize is ten million dollars and the phone number for  Dbridge
     support ...

     Binkleyterm came out with the  new  Janus  Joplin  protocol...
     OD's on line noise, and drops dead...

     Also in 1990, Eggnet .... nah... who cares about Eggnet ...

     Another  network  was  formed.  APInet.  Stands  for   Another
     Ph***in' International Network. If you  want  a  node  number,
     send a netmail to 69:6969/0. If you  can't  send  the  netmail
     because you don't have an APInet nodelist, well, tough...

     As the year closed, a guy  named  Ralph  Merritt  was  running
     for EC #2 in Eggnet. Vote for Ralph and vote for him often. HE
     cares about Eggnet, I suppose. If you're not in  Eggnet,  vote
     for him anyway...


     Well, I guess I just about insulted  everyone  I  could  think
     of. If you feel that I left someone or something out,  by  all
     MEANS, write us a letter! We aim to please.

     Happy New Year.

     K.B. '91

     Cheryl Buzzell
     101/200


                            Women in Fidoland

          Hi ya all. Been wanting to write this for some time now
     but have not had the guts to do so untill now. For those of
     you who do not know me, my name is Cheryl Buzzell. I run the
     TC-Trader BBS in Mass. I am the author of a couple of door
     programs for OPUS and recently Whouped, another program for
     Opus sysops.

          I have been into computers since 1977 when my brother
     first purchased his TRS-80 Model I computer. I used to hang
     out at the local Radio Shack store and bug the salesman there
     to let me play with it. His customers got a big kick out of it.
     This little girl playing with this fancy computer (oh sure back
     than the thing was fancy and the price tag would sink ya a few
     to prove it hahahaha). Back than I was only a kid and I
     certainly wasn't gonna argue over the attention, even if it was
     for no reason other than I was a "GIRL" playing with a computer.

          I started running my BBS in 1983. I was the only female
     sysop I knew who was running a "SERIOUS" bbs. Back than women
     ran bbs's like "MATCHMAKER" and other such things. I guess so
     men could get there kicks talking dirty to alot more women eh??
     Women had names like "CANDY" and "LOOSE LUCY". Quite a put down
     to the female species wouldn't you say????

          When I started my bbs it was with software called "TOWNE
     CRIER" (you out there Stew???). I know some of you are familiar
     with it as some of you were also running it back then. Back
     when we had our TRS-80 Model III's and IV's. We had a pretty
     small close knit crew who ran this software. I was the only
     femal (at least that I had gotton aquainted with). Back than a
     female sysop was welcomed at ANYONE's bbs. A guy sysop finds
     out you are a female running a bbs you get free totall access
     to his system. I think this was so they could show off how
     great they were since shortly after, it would be followed by a
     "why don't you do this or why not do that to your bbs".

          Things went downhill from there. I moved into the IBM
     world of bbs'ing. I ran from bbs software to bbs software
     trying to find a nitch where a women could fit in. Back then
     "FIDO" was the software to run. Not to put any sysops down but
     for a women to be part of that group would be the toughest
     thing to do. Talk about the good old boy network. I had one
     sysop be so bold as to tell me that the reason I didn't want
     to run "FIDO" was that as a female I was incapable of setting
     it up. I mean talk about degrading....

          Well It has been 14 years since I started a bbs and one
     would think that in that amount of time things would have
     come around alot. Now I am not saying that things have not
     changed, but we have got a LONG LONG way to go yet babe. Now
     women don't get that special attention of being a women sysop.
     That much I think is good by the way. BUT they just get TOTALLY
     ignored. Seems a female sysop is not "GOOD ENOUGH" for
     certain things. A women cannot be "One of the boys" I guess.
     "Hay why are there not many women around".

          Well I am one female sysop and I know there are many more
     out there somewhere and I am sure I can speak for the rest of
     the women out there that we are not gonna sit by and take it.
     We are gonna stand up and be counted. We DESERVE to be
     recognized and we have earned RESPECT and we are not gonna
     stop untill this is a free system where women have as much
     rights as men...................
