Thanks to Geno DellaMattia for rescueing lost mail and forwarding it
to 1:1/23.  Good luck and best wishes to the Keeper of the FidoNet
Archives on her disaster recovery mission.

CUD [Computer Underground Digest, freQable from 1:11/70] has had a
few articles recently concerning the social effects of technical
poverty.  What happens when computer communications are even
more important to more aspects of general living, and some people
don't have access to computers and the transactions made
possible by them?  Is everyone who is "computer-illiterate"
ghettoized more?  Should we become wistful about snail-mail art?

I'm very attached to my 286 with one meg of memory.  It was my first
machine and it took me a long time and luck to be able to buy it.  I
like it like some people like their cars or their pets.  Sometimes i
really want to try glitzy fast-machine-only stuff and will eventually,
but it won't be the same.  I want to learn how to do as much as possible
with as little as possible.  "Portability" could have a lot of
connotations.

Here is a Heinlein quoting George Bernard Shaw from Act II
of "Caesar and Cleopatra" on the frontispiece of "Glory Road" [sort
of like "info superhighway"]:

BRITANNUS (shocked)
          Caesar, this is not proper.
THEODOTUS (outraged)
          How?
CAESAR (recovering his self-possession)
          Pardon him Theodotus:  he is a barbarian, and thinks that
          the customs of his tribe and island are the laws of nature.

Trash the Moderator

In a recent issue of Fido News, Glob Blermer announced a new echo,
"Trash the Moderator."

Oh, what a noble enterprise. Finally, a place for those who can't
stand any sort of rule to go and vent their spleen. Maybe it will keep
the kiddies who think they can do anything, " 'cause Mom ain't
watchin'," from doing it in the echoes I read.

As an ex-Moderator, I want to offer my deep thanks to Glob for
thinking this one up. I can only hope that most of those who read
FNEWS appreciate why Fidonet requires that every conference have a
Moderator. Without them, SysOps' and and Fido volunteers' costs would
skyrocket, and users with a serious interest in a subject would soon
FidoNews 11-17                 Page:  3                    25 Apr 1994

quit BBS'ing, and get another hobby.

That Moderator's job is a thankless and time consuming task, and only
on rare occasions is it fun. That's why I'm an ex. Glob, you deserve
to be sentenced to read unmoderated echoes for a period of a year.

 The new echo was described thusly:

 =>>
 >
   DESC  The only place where you can hold that stupid
   nincompoop moderator up to the ridicule he or she
   deserves Monthly Recognition for Mod_A**h*le of the month,
   this Echo is dedicated to calling these all-powerful
   beanheads to account for their arbitrary and otherwise
   self-serving pronouncements.
 >
 -=>>

  Now, is that childish, or is that childish!

On Othernets and Standards
        by Michael Johnson

        What is it with all these othernets that pop up locally?  To
start up a BBS is one thing that will expand your horizons, but a
whole NET?  If you have a brilliant idea or even a captivating theme
then I can understand, but it seems all the little-nothing-nets are
just an escape from the hounding requirements of Fidonet.  In this
note, I am not referring to Adult Links or ITCnet or any other
well-established net. I am referring to the nets that exist simply
to go against the standards established by Fidonet (such as ZMH and
non-ANSI echoes).  The only thing these nets offer is a reprieve
from the established way of Fidonet.  These nothing-nets are going
with non-standard material in a non-standard way and doing
non-standard things and it simply doesn't make any sense!

        In short, they are cutting their throats - though they usually
die from other causes, like the nodes reaching puberty.

        It is my understanding that a net has but one purpose: to
bring together a broad range of people for the purpose of
information exchange.  If you go with non-standard material, then
you are simply cutting off more and more people by the thousands who
won't/can't subscribe to your non-standard way of doing things.
Fidonet is not DOS-net, Windows-net or ANSI-net and there is a very
good reason for that.  Try to get ANSI or Windows to run on a DEC or
an IBM 4381, but I would bet money that you can run a fidonet system
from either one.

        There are many people on many platforms that are able to
communicate simply for the reason that Fidonet laid down the
standards for such communication to exist.   If you are going to
FidoNews 11-17                 Page:  4                    25 Apr 1994

start up a new net (heaven forbid), why not take a lesson from
Fidonet (and other established nets) instead of making them the
enemy-net and sporting just lax rules for your patrons.

        These are the reasons that Fidonet is the largest amateur
network known to exist and little-nothing-net isn't even known to
exist.  Something to think about the next time you feel smart
because you can post high-bit ascii character art or some of that
RIP |08S|07H|03I|01T|00.

                With hate for no man,
                 Michael Johnson

4 letter words

Well... I would just like to make a short comment that hopefully you will
take it in the mannor that it is being sent.

Anyone that lowers him self to useing 4 letter words in anytype of
publication only shows his ignorants, lack of wisdome and knowledge to use
the proper language to tell his point.

I would very much like it if you would remove such words from future issues.
This is not *TOO* much to ask. Just something simple that would make quite a

"Dear Emily Postnews"

        Emily Postnews, foremost authority on proper net behaviour,
        gives her advice on how to act on the net:
-       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -
Dear Emily: Today I posted an article and forgot to include my
signature.  What should I do?  -- forgetful@myvax

A: Dear Forgetful: Rush to your terminal right away and post an
article that says, "Oops, I forgot to post my signature with that last
article.  Here it is."

Since most people will have forgotten your earlier article,
(particularly since it dared to be so boring as to not have a nice,
juicy signature) this will remind them of it.  Besides, people care
much more about the signature anyway.  See the previous letter for
more important details.
FidoNews 11-17                 Page:  7                    25 Apr 1994


Also, be sure to include your signature TWICE in each article.  That
way you're sure people will read it.
                                ------
Q: I cant spell worth a dam.  I hope your going too tell me what to
do?

A: Don't worry about how your articles look.  Remember it's the
message that counts, not the way it's presented.  Ignore the fact that
sloppy spelling in a purely written forum sends out the same silent
messages that soiled clothing would when addressing an audience.

                                ------
Q: How should I pick a subject for my articles?

A: Keep it short and meaningless.  That way people will be forced to
actually read your article to find out what's in it.  This means a
bigger audience for you, and we all know that's what the net is for.
If you do a followup, be sure and keep the same subject, even if it's
totally meaningless and not part of the same discussion.  If you
don't, you won't catch all the people who are looking for stuff on the
original topic, and that means less audience for you.

                                ------
Q: What sort of tone should I take in my article?

A: Be as outrageous as possible.  If you don't say outlandish things,
and fill your article with libelous insults of net people, you may not
stick out enough in the flood of articles to get a response.  The more
insane your posting looks, the more likely it is that you'll get lots
of followups.  The net is here, after all, so that you can get lots of
attention.

If your article is polite, reasoned and to the point, you may only get
mailed replies.  Yuck!

                                ------
Q: The posting software suggested I had too long a signature and too
many lines of included text in my article.  What's the best course?

A: Such restrictions were put in the software for no reason at all, so
don't even try to figure out why they might apply to your article.
Turns out most people search the net to find nice articles that
consist of the complete text of an earlier article plus a few lines.

In order to help these people, fill your article with dummy original
lines to get past the restrictions.  Everybody will thank you for it.

For your signature, I know it's tough, but you will have to read it in
with the editor.  Do this twice to make sure it's firmly in there.  By
the way, to show your support for the free distribution of
information, be sure to include a copyright message forbidding
transmission of your article to sites whose USENET politics you don't
like.

FidoNews 11-17                 Page:  8                    25 Apr 1994

Also, if you do have a lot of free time and want to trim down the text
in your article, be sure to delete some of the attribution lines so
that it looks like the original author of -- say -- a plea for world
peace actually wrote the followup calling for the nuking of Bermuda.

                               ------

LINUX_F - An echo for Linux users

by Iain Brown 1:124/5118
LINUX_F - An echo for Linux users

Linux is a Unix-like operating system, freely available for 386 /
486-class machines. Interest in Linux within Fidonet is high, but
many Linux users avoid the backboned LINUX echo because of volume
(it's gated from Usenet).

LINUX_F is a dedicated Fidonet-only echo to support Linux. It will
not be gated to or from Usenet. Discussions of any aspect of Linux
setup / use are welcome. It is elisted, but not yet on the backbone.

Canadain Christian Interchange Network
CCIN Helps Canadian Christians Unite!

By Greg Gay

1:342/51 8:7504/0
LIFELINE BBS - (403) 481-4977

Christian sysops in Canada who are looking for a distinctly Canadian
Christian viewpoint should consider joining the Canadian Christian
Interchange Network (CCIN).  The four-month old net uses existing
FamilyNet addresses to carry this dynamic evangelistic and
missions-oriented network.

CCIN is already spreading across the nation with nodes in Alberta,
BC. and Ontario.  More are to come on-line soon.

Unlike many other computer networks, CCIN sysops are not content with
idle chatter. This is a net that is reaching out to a lost world and
helping Christians connect with each other to share insights,
resources, and information.  CCIN benefits from its working
relationship with NEWS, (Networking for Evangelism and World outreach
Society) which is a vehicle for missions co-ordination and the
promotion of Para-Church organizations across Canada.  Their Great
Canadian Opportunity Catalogue, a resource guide of missions
opportunities is carried on-line by all CCIN systems and is updated
monthly.  This Electronic version is referred to as NEWS-Net.

FidoNews 11-17                 Page:  9                    25 Apr 1994

CCIN has many general availability echoes established, including
CCI-P&P, where users leave their prayer and praise requests in a
natural electronic prayer chain; CCI-TECH, for helping established
and newbie sysops and users solve their technical problems; and
CCI-*-EVT, a local or regional specific echo for posting
announcements of upcoming concerts, speakers and Christian events.

There are also many other speciality echoes for church leaders and
missions personnel. These are the available echoes as of this
writing.

 * Canadian Christian National Events and Co-ordination
 * Canadian Christian Interchange Chatter
 * Child Evangelism
 * Church Planting
 * Implementing Church Programs
 * Drama & Music In Outreach
 * Education/Equipping
 * Ethnic Outreach
 * Discussion Area for Evangelists
 * Church Growth
 * Canadian Home Schooling
 * Innovative Outreach
 * General Discussion of Missions Issues
 * Missions Preparation
 * Canadian Christian Interchange Sysops ONLY Echo
 * Networking/Strategy Awareness & Tips
 * Prayer Request and Praise Reports
 * Canadian Christian Interchange Politics
 * The Great Canadian Debate
 * General Technical Help and Discussion
 * Trends Affecting Outreach
 * Canadian Youth Ministry for Youth Workers

CCIN has already been the subject of feature news articles in Alberta
Report, Western Report, Focus on the Family and ChristianWeek.

For an application packet, please file request the 'magic' file name
"CCIN" from the above system.

Is NOT about rocks..although it deals with ROCK. RockNet is NOT new,
although it maybe to some, and is NEW to "Fido" Format. RockNet is NOT
a Network dedicated to your 70's Pet Rock's well being ( I know some of
you still have them hidden away!). RockNet is NOT just another BORING
Echomail Conference. So, if RockNet isn't any of those things..what IS
it you ask ? ..Gee, I'm Glad you did ! Read On and get the inside info
on one of the Fastest growing Nets in America, RockNet, The ONLY Network
dedicated to those who love Music and Entertainment !

1) The History of RockNet.

 RockNet has been in existence since 1992, starting as a small local net
dedicated to those who's interest in Music compelled them to WRITE about
it to other BBS users. It has gone through some major changes since,
"absorbing" a Florida Based Network, FLOnet along the way, and expanding
it's reach a little further all the time. The one thing that has
remained the same, aside from it's origination BBS, Boston Rocks, and
it's main theme, Music, is it's commitment to excellence to it's USERS.
All the Users of RockNet are encouraged to send their ideas to their
Local Hubs or Nodes to be forwarded to the Network Administrator. About
90% of these usually BRILLIANT ideas have been used to help expand the
Network.

 When RockNet started, it was available in .QWK only, and usually was
frequented by musicians or diehard Music buffs. That has changed !!!
RockNet is Now available in BOTH QWK and FIDO format (see info provided
at the end for more details on this!) and has become a place where those
who LISTEN to music, as well as write and play it can communicate with
each other on an even platform. EVERYONE counts in RockNet !

 Within the past month, RockNet has expanded to Hubs located Coast to
Coast in the United States, and More applications for Hubs and Nodes
are coming in daily. RockNet's Home BBS, Boston Rocks, has committed
$15,000 to upgrade to a 6 Node Lan and a dedicated Mail server, to be
set up within the next 60 days to maintain the quality of both the BBS
and RockNet. Additionally, 28.8 modems will be added to most lines.
We have also actively sought out some of the Best systems available to
act as Hubs for RockNet to make YOUR access easier !

So, That was a quick summary of where RockNet stands Today.

2) Can I get RockNet ??

 SURE !!!! We WANT you to partake in this net. ( I guess that would be
the reason I'm writing this!) RockNet's goal is to expand 200% in the
next 6 months..and, we WILL meet that objective ! The foundation is now
in place, all that is left is for you to help build the structure. I'm

sure ALL of you have some interest in Music and Entertainment, and if
you as SYSOPS have time for that..imagine your users!

3) OK..I'm ALMOST convinced..what about the Conferences ??

 Gee, I'm glad you asked that !! A list of Conferences and a Brief
description of each follows right after this next dotted line !!!
