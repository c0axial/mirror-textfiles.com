                      TAKE A BYTE OF "NEWTON'S APPLE"
                         WITH FREEWARE FROM DU PONT


     NEWTON'S APPLE, the upbeat popular PBS science series, enters the
     computer age in October with the introduction of  NEWTON'S  APPLE
     FREEWARE  FROM  DU  PONT.  Produced by KTCA-TV in Minneapolis/St.
     Paul, and made possible by a grant from the Du Pont Company,  the
     award-winning series begins its fourth season this fall.

     For  the past three years,  NEWTON'S APPLE viewers at home and in
     the classroom have enjoyed the fun and fascination of  scientific
     discovery.  Now  viewers can take discovery one step further with
     free software made possible by a grant from Du Pont.

     The NEWTON'S APPLE FREEWARE package will consist  of  five  Apple
     compatible  programs  that  will each treat one of the scientific
     principles covered in the series.  For example, as NEWTON'S APPLE
     host Ira Flatow relates the laws of probability to  the  workings
     of a slot machine, a companion software program brings the lesson
     to  viewers'  fingertips.  Through  computer  simulations of coin
     flipping, dice throwing and slot machine playing, the user learns
     why gambling doesn't always  pay.  Additional  software  will  be
     based  on  such  program segment themes as mirrors,  hypothermia,
     inertia and a season quiz.

     NEWTON'S APPLE  has  been  endorsed  by  the  National  Education
     Association  and  has received awards for both the series and its
     educational materials from Action for  Childrens  Television  and
     the National Broadcast Promotion Association.

     NEWTON'S APPLE FREEWARE FROM DU PONT will be made available at no
     cost  to  viewers.  The  software will be available on Compuserve
     through the Apple Forum and  on  The  Source  through  the  Apple
     Special  Interest Group (SIG) and EdLine.  The software will also
     be distributed via a nationwide network of  local  computer  user
     groups  and  bulletin  boards,  from  which users (whether school
     systems or individuals) will be able to either download  or  send
     for the programs.

     FIDO  bulletin boards are ideal for this kind of network,  and we
     are happy to offer NEWTON'S APPLE FREEWARE FROM DU  PONT  to  all
     interested  sysops.  If  your  bulletin board would like to offer
     this software,  please contact Thom Henderson at  node  107/7  so
     that  he  can  send  me a list of interested sysops.  We would be
     happy to let you preview the software when it  becomes  available
     later  this  summer.  We  would  also  include  the  name of your
     bulletin board in all press releases sent to your area.

     I look forward to hearing from you.

     Tim Sullivan, 108/62

                                Thanks USR!


     Monday July 28, 1986 my U.S. Robotics Courier 2400 modem began to
     act very odd;  by Tuesday it decided not to  act  at  all.  After
     eliminating all other possible causes I determined that the fault
     must have been with the modem.

     First thing Wednesday morning I dialed USR's tech support number:
     (800) 982-5151.  After  giving  the  technician  only  my modem's
     serial number he said,  "What can I do  to  help  Mr.  Sullivan".
     Within  moments  we  determined that there was a physical problem
     with the modem.  We made arrangements to  have  a  new  PC  board
     shipped direct to me overnight.

     Thursday  morning  UPS  arrived with the new PC board and after a
     quick replacement I was up and running again.

     I have dealt with many mail-order shops,  local computer  stores,
     dealers,  and  computer  manufacturers,  and  I  have  never seen
     anything that can compare with the  accuracy  of  USR's  customer
     infomation,  quality  of  their product,  and promptness of their
     customer support.

     So, THANKS USR for a job well done!

     Mark J. Welch, 161/459

                            Does Shareware work?


     "It depends." Mostly,  it depends on what type of product it  is,
     what audience it's aimed at, how often you update it, and, rarely
     on what the price is.

     Many  authors,  with  Jim  Button  being  one of the most visible
     examples, have switched from "Shareware" to "Demo-ware," in which
     they include a subset of the manual or a crippled version of  the
     program,  forcing  you  to  upgrade in order to use the product's
     full feature set. I think that sucks, but it's also inevitable.

     Demo-ware deprives the user  of  the  chance  to  test-drive  the
     product  completely.  It's like getting to test drive a car,  but
     only for ten feet inside the dealer showroom.  You can tell if it
     moves,  and you can see what color paint it has,  but you have no
     idea how it's going to perform on the freeway.

     Other companies have abandoned Shareware entirely. Take a look at
     the August 25 InfoWorld.  PC-Index, praised by Jerry Pournelle in
     BYTE,  was  withdrawn  from Shareware,  because only three people
     paid for it.  PC-Outline was sold to Brown Bag Software,  and  is
     now  available  only  as  a  commercial product.  (Brown Bag also
     sells PC-Write under its own name,  in what I think is a  bizarre
     but  quite  acceptable  compromise:  offer  the  program  both as
     Shareware and commercially, and see what happens.)

     A  good  compromise  is  Chi-Write,   which  gives  you  a  fully
     functional  program  but  flashes an advertising appeal for money
     every once in a while.  You also have to pay for the  product  if
     you want support for certain displays and printers.  That's fair:
     it gives you a chance to use all the features, but doesn't really
     let you get away with using the package forever for free.



     Does Shareware ever work?  Ask Bob Wallace (of Quicksoft,  author
     of  PC-Write).  He  has  one  of  the best word processors on the
     market,  and he gives the whole  product  and  the  whole  manual
     (except  the  index)  on  disk,  and  he  makes  genuine  product
     enhancements every six months or  so.  For  him,  Shareware  sure
     ought to work. People use the product every day, corporations use
     it, and they can measure how much the program is worth by looking
     at comparable commercial packages.  Bob makes money. Lots of it.

     Quicksoft  also offers support to registered users,  and for your
     $75 (the price was scheduled to rise soon),  you get the  manual,
     the  program  on disk,  and business-reply postcards good for two
     disk updates.  And you get a newsletter a couple or four times  a
     year,  notifying  you of updates and such.  Quicksoft is the best
     example I could point to.

     Then,  on  the  other  extreme,  there's  PC-Talk,  the  original
     Fidonews                     Page 7                   18 Aug 1986


     Shareware program, written by the late Andrew Fluegelman, and Red
     Ryder, from Scott Watson.  In both cases, I have talked to people
     who sent in their $35 and got absolutely  nothing.  Not  even  an
     eighteen-cent  postcard  saying  "thanks."  I've  heard  that the
     situation has improved,  but the bad  reputation  will  certainly
     last, and will hurt other shareware authors.

     I  hate  to  upset  our  Humble  Editor,  but Systems Enhancement
     Associates took  my  money  ($50)  and  sent  me  a  disk  and  a
     photocopied manual,  but I never got a notice of the new version.
     I just found it one day on a local BBS.  [Thank Ghu the version I
     found wasn't 5.13...] Let's be fair,  too:  despite the fact that
     every sysop and BBS user [yes,  you!] in  the  country  uses  ARC
     regularly,  very  few people have sent checks to Thom and Andrew.
     Maybe that explains why SEAdog,  the  Fido-compatible  electronic
     mail system, isn't Shareware.

     I guess human nature dictates that more often than not, Shareware
     won't  work.  If I can get something for free,  I'm not likely to
     pay for it just to make me feel good.  I already have the program
     for free; I want something more for my $35, and in Shareware that
     means  update  notices,  upgrades,  or  at least a thank you that
     shows that the shareware author has warm, fuzzy feelings.



     Shareware doesn't work for games.

     The Generic Adventure Game System (GAGS) has done moderately well
     -- I've taken in about $3,000 total,  in twelve  months,  against
     total expenses of about $2,500.  My time -- 30 to 40 hours a week
     for six months of development,  and maybe 10 hours a  week  since
     then -- will never be paid for,  even at minimum wage.  (Alas,  I
     collect sales tax from Californians,  and take hours to file that
     paperwork;  and  I'll  file an honest tax return and pay taxes on
     that $500 profit as well....)

     Most game authors don't do nearly as well.  One author I spoke to
     received  no  checks  for  an entertainment program,  even though
     after a year he know of a users' group that had sold hundreds  of
     copies.

     Obviously,  games  are  low  priority.  I use PC-Write every day,
     perhaps for 10-20 hours a week.  It is a tool,  and  I  value  it
     highly.  I  play Trek 2.3 once a week at best.  And I can see the
     value of PC-Write:  it helps me  make  money  as  a  professional
     writer.  Trek, on the other hand, is simply fun.  We pay $5.50 to
     see a movie, for two hours of entertainment,  yet most users will
     never send the $10 Shareware contribution for Trek.

     Yes,  I paid for PC-Write,  PC-Windows,  ARC, and Trek.  I have a
     vested interest in paying for my Shareware, of course,  since I'm
     a Shareware author.

     I've  briefly used dozens of other programs -- the Disk Organizer
     (DOG101A), Fansi-Console, PC-Outline, Instant Recall,  and others
     Fidonews                     Page 8                   18 Aug 1986


     -- and not paid for them because,  despite their high quality,  I
     don't use them. That, of course, is the whole point of Shareware:
     if you use it, pay for it. But if you use it, pay for it.  That's
     what  they mean when they say "User-Supported Software," which is
     more awkward but also more appropriate.



     If I were doing it all  over  again,  would  I  release  GAGS  as
     Shareware?

     Yes.  I released GAGS as Shareware because I wanted to be certain
     of success.  If I'd sold it to a publisher,  in the  dismal  game
     market of mid-1985,  it certainly would have lost money, since it
     would have cost a fortune to create packaging, print manuals, and
     so on. By distributing GAGS as Shareware, I've managed to get the
     program into thousands of people's hands,  and I've gotten checks
     from  a  few dozen.  And my name is in the limelight,  since many
     BBSs have GAGS available for on-line game playing.

     All in all, GAGS has turned out about as I'd expected. Better, in
     fact,  since I was much more pessimistic.  I was surprised when I
     hit the $1,000 mark,  and when I hit that point I actually turned
     around and put extra effort  into  upgrading  GAGS  to  meet  the
     requests of my registered users.

     That,  I  suppose,  is  what  proves that paying for Shareware is
     important: getting checks prompted me to provide service to those
     users.  (The $15 registration for me has been a  mixed  blessing:
     I've  sent  out  four  or  five update notices,  which take time,
     energy, paper, envelopes and postage.)

     My wildest dreams haven't come true, though. Bob Wallace takes in
     hundreds of thousands of dollars a year for  PC-Write,  and  he's
     got  an  office  and  staff  people.  Jim  Button even has an 800
     number. They are the exceptions.

     An aside:  Public domain,  for the IBM PC,  is much rarer than it
     was  for  CP/M.  I  guess  that's because of Shareware.  A lot of
     people who would once have released a package  as  public  domain
     are deciding instead to put a little request in,  saying,  if you
     like this program, please send $10, or $25, or whatever you think
     it's worth.  They get a few  checks,  maybe  some  get  a  couple
     hundred  dollars,  and  maybe  that  encourages them.  If it were
     public domain,  maybe people who'd paid  nothing  would  be  more
     willing to offer suggestions. Hmm.



     The next project?  I'm working with some other programmers on BIX
     [the BYTE Information Exchange] to write a  set  of  programs  to
     test  for  IBM  compatibility.  It  will  be  pure public-domain,
     because we all agree that a public-domain project  is  much  more
     likely to elicit help from software vendors and other programmers
     (hint, hint) than a Shareware or commercial project where someone
     would get money for other people's suggestions.
     Fidonews                     Page 9                   18 Aug 1986


     The  Compatibility  Test  Program  Suite  will  be  public domain
     because of the nature of the project. If I were doing GAGS again,
     given the fact that the market for games  is  better,  I'd  think
     seriously about selling it commercially.

     I  doubt I'll write another game program,  though,  so there's no
     way to be sure.  I'll probably port GAGS to  the  Macintosh  this
     fall,  and  release it as Shareware.  I won't go to the effort of
     porting to any machine that Borland doesn't release Turbo for:  I
     don't  believe enough Amiga or ST owners would pay for it to make
     it worth it.

     If someone came to me with a proposal to take GAGS commercial for
     the Mac or another  system,  or  even  enhance  it  and  take  it
     commercially for the PC, I'd think about it very seriously.



     What effect has Shareware had on the industry?

     In the case of communications software, it's been devastating.  I
     think PC-Talk,  Procomm, and Qmodem have more installed base than
     the commercial packages. Most of them aren't paid for, but people
     keep writing new Shareware communications  packages.  The  effect
     is that, unless you're Microstuf with a solid, recognized product
     like  Crosstalk,  you don't have a chance.  Microsoft hasn't even
     made a dent with Microsoft Access,  although part of  the  reason
     may be its problems with its copy-protection scheme.

     Other areas haven't been as good.  PC-Write has done well,  and I
     love it,  but I don't  think  it's  even  in  the  top  ten  word
     processors  in  terms  of  regular  users.  The  same  applies to
     databases and spreadsheets. I don't even know of a good Shareware
     spreadsheet.

     Shareware has done its part to cut the cost of  software,  but  I
     think Borland was much more important at that. The whole idea, to
     me,  is that if I pay for a package and get lousy support,  buggy
     code, bad documentation, or just plain bad software, I'm going to
     jump ship at the first chance I get,  whether it's shareware from
     Mark Welch or commercial software from Lotus or Ashton-Tate.

                                                  -- Mark J. Welch


     P.S.

     By  now,  most  everyone  knows  that  the generic terms for this
     method  of  distribution  are  "Shareware"  and  "User-supported-
     software." "Freeware" is a trademark of the Headlands Press,  and
     applies only to PC-Talk.  In some ways, it's a good thing,  since
     "Freeware"  implies  that  the  program is free,  while the other
     terms better express what's going on:  people  sharing  software,
     and users supporting software authors.

     For those who are curious:  I moved, left InfoWorld, and WelchNet
     is now a  private  mail-only  FidoNet  node,  all  because  I  am
     starting  law school at the University of California at Berkeley.
     (Hmm.  Maybe if Shareware had worked  better,  I'd  be  going  to
     Stanford or Harvard....Then again, no.)

     WHAT IS "ALS" AND WHY IS FIDO BEING "AFFLICTED" WITH IT?

     First of all,  the FidoNet itself  has  some  deep  philosophical
     roots  in the Alternate Lifestyle(s) Movement ...  The "shall not
     be too easily annoyed" dictum is  a  basic  reality  of  communal
     living.  Dedication to "free and gratis" BBSs is something Hippie
     and   Digger  survivors  can  recognize  as  their  own  economic
     utopianism in a new context.  The Fido wizard's  attitude  toward
     individual   creativity   and   responsibility   would  strike  a
     responsive chord among Beatniks and Libertarians.

     The term ALS has carried with it connotations of  benign  secular
     humanism,  leftish  politics  and  sexual  adventurousness.   The
     "alternatives" in ALS usually referred to replacements for diadic
     romanticism.  Celibacy  (lifelong singleness ...  not necessarily
     chastity), and various forms of plural marriage and communalism
     ... were (and still are) explored.

     SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT ... so to speak.

     There has been a deplorable trend in the BBS world to use ALS  as
     a  euphemism  for  Gay.  This bit of NewSpeak usually describes a
     SIG in a commercial data service run by people  who  are  neither
     Gay nor ALS.

     Not  all  Gays are living alternate lifestyles.  Conversely,  not
     all ALS people are Gay.  Gay and ALS are are not synonymous;  nor
     are  they  mutually  exclusive.  In  the BBS world,  Gay BBSs are
     among the most  numerous,  oldest  and  most  sophisticated  non-
     technical boards.

     NOW, ABOUT "SWINGERS" ... ARE THEY ALS?

     There  are  different  kinds  of  "swingers":  among them are the
     Recreationals, Utopians, and the "Would-Be's." The Bees and their
     sons are by far the most numerous,  the least ALS,  and the  most
     catered   to  by  the  erotic  entertainment  industry.   Fantasy
     dominates in these BBSs,  with "hot chat" an increasingly popular
     activity on commercial, mainstream data services.

     AND WHOM ELSE ??

     An  Alternate  Lifestyle(s)  BBS,  in  addition to addressing the
     issues of Gay men, Lesbian women, Family Synergy households, non-
     exclusive  couples  and  polyfidelitous  individuals   (be   they
     Fidonews                     Page 12                  18 Aug 1986


     straight,  biSexual,  or Gay),  can also legitimately find itself
     providing an electronic center  for  Feminists,  single  parents,
     Naturists  and  members of many other groups that find themselves
     ill-served by mainstream media.

     THE UTOPIAN QUEST

     On Valentine's Day,  1985,  The UTOPIAN Network's TBBS became one
     of   the   few  reality  based,   sexually  oriented,   Alternate
     Lifestyle(s) BBSs in the country. In March of 1986, Utopian Quest
     LI joined the FidoNet and EchoMail capability was added in July.

     We want to find other nodes in the FidoNet that  see  themselves,
     partially or totally, as ALS boards.  If any of what we have said
     in this article strikes a responsive chord,  we want to hear from
     you ... and soon.

     Mitch Kessler, Gerrie Blum, 107/269

                           Adult but not X-rated


     UTOPIAN_QUEST_LI, Fido 107/269,  Copiague NY is looking for other
     nodes  and  individual  users involved with Alternate Lifestyles.
     UTOPIAN started as a correspondence club more than  a  year  ago,
     running  under  TBBS.  Until  now,  it has been used primarily by
     bisexuals,  non-traditional couples and a few  Gay  participants.
     However,  we  hope  participation  in FidoNet will lead to a more
     diversified user and information base.

     UTOPIAN's efforts are concentrated on issues of social and sexual
     (rather than dietary  or  religious)  options.  For  example;  in
     conjunction  with  London's OUTSIDER'S CLUB,  we are beginning to
     explore how electronic communications can meet the the social and
     creative needs of disabled people.

     UTOPIAN   QUEST  is  Adult  but  not  X-rated.   Mature  and  non
     judgmental  discussion  of  any  subject  is  welcome,   although
     Alternative   Family  and  Family  Surrogate  structures:   Line,
     Contract,  Egalitarian  and  Group  Marriages;  Multi-Adult,  and
     Cooperative Households,  Singles-By-Choice and Sexual Minorities,
     are uniquely appropriate in The UTOPIAN.

     In addition to providing a forum and information resource for the
     Alternate Lifesyles,  UTOPIAN QUEST will operate like  any  other
     Fido  node,  although with a distinctly non-technical slant.  The
     files section will  specialize  in  programs  with  liberal  arts
     applications  and  in  guides  and  tutorials  which  help  bring
     microcomputer technology to new users.

     Combatting both Sexism and CompPhobia through education  is  part
     of the Utopian Committment.

                               --: 80MATE :--
                        Running CP/M 80 Under MS-DOS

                              Scott N. Loveall


     A  unique  and fascinating product crossed my path the other day.
     At first I hardly noticed its  existence.  Similiar  to  many  of
     todays  utility-type  software packages,  this one was bundled in
     flat vinyl covered 5 by 7 book-jack, and contained only a slim 40
     page manual and a disk.  It whispered hoarsely as if  lacking  in
     confidence and self image.  No wonder,  it sat only inches from a
     towering box of Symphony.  80MATE screamed in a dreary washed-out
     graphic  on  a sickly creme background.  It almost seemed ashamed
     to be what it claimed; a lowly CP/M co-processing package for the
     mighty IBM and its ever present opening act "The Compatables".

     The image,  marketing (or lack of),  and claims of  this  product
     were too much.  That 80MATE could do what it claimed,  seemed too
     good to be true.  Here was a  product  few  had  ever  heard  of,
     claiming  to  do  the task of a chunk of hardware often exceeding
     $300 dollars.  All seemed a  ruse  until  I  noted  the  software
     company,  VERTEX.  This  was a plus.  Vertex already had a highly
     touted (though overrated) DOS disk format conversion  product  on
     the market called Xenocopy. 80MATE was worth a second look.

     Upon  close perusal of the enclosed "pamphlet",  I found a number
     of CP/M formats supported:  APPLE  CP/M-80,  Heath  Z/19  -  Z89,
     Kaypro II/IV,  Osborne, Morrow Designs, Televideo 900 series, and
     the Zerox 820.  I would try it.  Further  reading  revealed  that
     the thrust of the program was directed at 80MATE being capable of
     emulating  CP/M  in memory when run in your friendly neighborhood
     DOS machine.  It claimed to set  up  an  island  in  memory  that
     intercepted the Z80 code before it could be processed by the 8088
     CPU  (Central Processing Unit) of most MSDOS computers.  A worthy
     concept, if it worked.

     To create a workable model,  the CP/M  programs  of  choice  must
     first  be  transferred  to  a  formatted  MSDOS diskette.  On the
     Kaypro and many others,  this requires a CP/M  format  conversion
     program  such  as  COMPAT  or  UNIFORM  [or  MEDIA  MASTER  by DG
     Systems].  This is not at all obvious until AFTER the product  is
     purchased,  and should be stated on the cover.  Obviously, Vertex
     finds this  a  crafty  way  to  sell  its  Xenocopy  disk  format
     conversion product.

     My first two UNIFORM copies that I was able to obtain,  just hung
     up.  A friend tells me that such conversion  programs  are  drive
     alignment sensitive,  and may be finicky.  He reported needing to
     try 3 copies before finding one  that  would  work  properly.  My
     experienced  confirmed this.  I formatted a fresh DOS diskette on
     my Compaq Deskpro, placed it drive b:  of my Kaypro 4-84, and ran
     Fidonews                     Page 15                  18 Aug 1986


     UNIFORM in drive a:.  When UNIFORM prompted me,  I placed Perfect
     Writer in a:,  and transfered all files to  b:  I  repeated  this
     process with Wordstar,  dBase II,  SuperCalc2, and The Word Plus.
     In about 20  minutes,  all  was  complete.  Moving  over  to  the
     Compaq,  I eased 80MATE into the drive and asked for a directory.
     I typed DIR and received a full report.  Z80 was among  the  many
     choices present.  I typed in Z80.  Response: "Someone has tried a
     disk copy.  Aren't you nosey?".  It immediately locked up.

     Investigating  this  phenomenon  revealed  that  the  product  is
     protected by a sleazey form of Prolock that ruins your disk if  a
     copy  is  attempted.  Now  that  would only be half bad if bright
     bold letters warned of this feature,  but nowhere was it  written
     that this will occur.  To make matters more irritating, I had not
     attempted  a  copy  of  this product.  Apparently this protection
     scheme is a means for Vertex to acquire an  additional  20  clams
     for  replacing  your  violated diskette.  On the pricipal of this
     practice alone,  I was sorely tempted to just ignore the  product
     all  together.  Why  publicize  such  obvious  victimization  and
     arrogance.  My other self cried for justice  through  the  poison
     pen.  A  third  self  said,  forget it,  it will do no good.  The
     third self was probably right.

     Upon finally obtaining  a  bootable  and  workable  copy,  I  was
     greeted  with  an  "A>Z80  CP/M"  prompt.  I inserted the Perfect
     Writer programs and typed PW. Sure enought up it came. I had also
     tranferred a data file written with Perfect Writer, and called it
     to the fore.  It came up justified,  and styled  just  as  I  had
     written  it.  I  was astounded and pleased.  I tried the same for
     the dBase II, Wordstar,  and Word Plus.  The result was the same.
     Flawless  performance  of CP/M under MSDOS.  SuperCalc2 I'm sorry
     to say, did not fare so well.  It seems that 80MATE only supports
     those programs for the older Kaypro IIs and  IVs.  Anything  with
     graphics  calls  such  as  the  "new"  versions  of  the Micropro
     software packaged with the 2-84, 4-84, and 10 will cause moderate
     to severe alterations in the screen output.  SuperCalc2 is such a
     program in that the version run, was installed to support reverse
     video.  Normally SuperCalc2 for the Kaypro does not do  this,  so
     it should run with this conversion if purchased and unchanged.  I
     retried  an  non-graphic  installed version and it performed just
     fine.

     In retrospect,  the video problem is to be  expected.  The  major
     drawbacks  of most co-processors are their inability to interpret
     and re-route various video calls.  This is true of  the  Co-Power
     88 board for the Kaypro and even the Quadlink Apple co-processors
     for  IBM.  The  ROMS are just too different.  Vertex has included
     in its 80MATE manual,  a section on  terminal  emulation.  Again,
     however,  the virtues of reverse video, underlining, and boldface
     are not taken into consideration  for  the  older  Kaypro  models
     incapable of such functions.

     It  can be asked why you and I would even consider acquiring such
     a product as 80MATE.  The vast majority of programs which run  on
     our Kaypros are also available for MSDOS.  In most all cases, the
     many  other applications that run on the IBM (et.  al.),  can run
     Fidonews                     Page 16                  18 Aug 1986


     circles around our prehistoric(?) CP/M  stuff.  Well  that  could
     certainly  be debated at length,  but the point is that what most
     of us would be after is text  file  compatability,  not  80MATE's
     functions.

     What  80MATE  provides  is a means of achieving universality.  An
     associate writer and teacher tells the tale of how he would  like
     to  have  Perfect  Writer  in MSDOS so that he could use the IBMs
     that fill the rooms at his workplace.  Programs  such  as  Kamas,
     Plu*Perfect  Writer,  and various CP/M utilities can be run while
     not  worrying  about  the  unlearned  or  forgotten  commands  of
     Wordstar   or   Perfect   Writer.   Although  not  a  big  ticket
     application item,  80MATE nonetheless provides a function that is
     valuable for many but not most.

     Although    thouroughly    turned    off    by    the   company's
     protection/numbers racket,  I recommend  the  program.  It  works
     without  a hitch,  supports a comfortable number of CP/M formats,
     at $140,  though expensive it doesn't cost an arm and a leg,  and
     it  is  easy  to  learn and run.  With the Kaypro 16 entering the
     marketplace, a number of us will no doubt become a multi-DOS user
     as I have.  Programs such as the  Perfect  Software  series,  Thw
     Word Plus (Absent from the 16's software lineup),  and Microplan,
     may also represent programs strongly  invested  in.  To  be  sure
     80MATE has a place for those in need.

     Should  you  search  out  this program and buy it,  please take a
     moment to trounce its company Vertex,  thats V E R T E X,  with a
     bit  of hate mail about its protection scheme.  It probably won't
     do any good, but you'll feel better,  I'll be grateful,  and heh,
     you never know.

     James Whorton, 14/623

                   FidoNet technical information needed!

       Have you  ever  tried  to  write  a  FidoNet  clone  system?  I
     recommend  it  as  a way to truly appreciate the Fido environment
     that we use.  I decided to write a clone system for two  reasons.
     First,  already  having  written a somewhat complex remote system
     called RTE (Remote Turbo Environment) I had no  wish  to  abandon
     that  system  and  all the effort that had gone into creating it.
     Second,  and perhaps more important,  I run a Z80  based  CP/M-80
     system  with an 8088 coprocessor card with 512K ram utilizing MS-
     DOS 2.11.  The BIOS functions are emulated fairly well, including
     the basic monochrome graphics mode,  but that is a far  cry  from
     having a "clone" system.

       I  was fortunate enough to have several excellent Fido nodes in
     my local area (14/609,  14/621 and 14/608),  the SysOps of  which
     have all been most helpful and supportive of my efforts.  But the
     primary  stumbling block to writing this clone software was,  and
     is,  solid technical  information.  To  date,  using  the  formal
     network  protocol  definition  that  Tom  Jennings  wrote back in
     October of 1984,  I have managed to put together a system that is
     capable  of  both  sending and receiving mail and attached files,
     although I have not yet  been  able  to  implement  either  2-way
     transfer of packets and files,  or the POLL and PICKUP functions.
     The reason is  simple:  I  do  not  have  any  current  technical
     information on these aspects of the FidoNet protocol.

       Having  read  the  latest  FidoNews  I  see  that  a new formal
     definition is apparently going to be put together.  We should all
     applaud this effort.  However, an effort of this type can take an
     indeterminate amount of time, and I must admit to being impatient
     to bring my hybrid system up to full Fido node status.

       If anyone can provide  any  current  technical  information  or
     assistance, it would be greatly appreciated.  My node, 14/623, is
     on-line and ready for your input!

       Thank you for your kind attention, and long live FidoNet.

                            (BS is our business)

     Has it never troubled you that Fido is a surly beast  when  first
     he  wakes?  An  ill-mannered  cur  with downcast eyes who shows a
     dull blank face to the world,  cowering with his tail between his
     legs, and too fearful to speak unless spoken to?

     Oh, the shame of it!

     Have  you  never dreamed of a happy Fido with his eyes bright and
     smiling,  tail wagging,  ears erect,  ready to greet each  caller
     with a pleasantly well-bred, cheerful welcoming bark?

     Of course you have.

     Rest  easy,  my friend.  If your computer is IBM compatible,  all
     those sleepless nights have ended.  Your fondest fantasy has been
     fulfilled.  For only $25.00, a jot,  a tittle,  a mere bagatelle,
     you can purchase a little friend for Fido,  a pup named BDawg who
     can change Fido's disposition overnight.

     BDawg wakes when the phone rings, announces the baud rate and the
     time of day,  and gently nips at Fido until he clears the cobwebs
     from his fuzzy head,  gives a friendly bark, and goes out to work
     singing.  Faithful little friend that  he  is,  BDawg  lets  Fido
     think  he  found  the  baud rate by himself,  and Fido glows with
     sweet satisfaction in a job well done.

     Think of it!

     All those bitter days of loneliness ended for Fido.  No more  new
     users  staring  at  a  blank  screen in ignorant dismay.  No more
     switch hook blips from cheapie  modems  that  trigger  the  wrong
     rate.  No more nights spent dreaming of a better day.

                    No more CRs, no more spaces,
                    No more users' angry faces!

         Be kind to man's best friend.  Be kind to yourself.

                        Order BDawg today!

     Note:  No  profit  is  made  from  the  sale of the Public Domain
     software in this collection.  The price is  applied  entirely  to
     the  cost  of  downloading  the  software  over  the phone lines,
     running a  BBS  to  receive  file  submissions,  and  inspecting,
     cataloguing, archiving and maintaining the files.  Obtaining this
     software yourself through the use of  a  computer  with  a  modem
     using  commercial phone access would cost you much more than what
     we charge for the service...

     Please specify what type of format you would like the disks to be
     prepared on.  The following choices are available:
           - IBM PC-DOS Backup utility

     expensive  disks).  There  are  no  shipping or handling charges.
     California residents add 6% tax.

     For each sale, $10 will go to the FidoNet Administrators.

     I recently gave my sister my old cp/m computer/printer/modem so I
     could stay in touch with her via FidoNet.  I live in  Miami,  Fl.
     and she is attending school at the U.  of Fla.  in Gainsville.  I
     drove the six hours up there, set her up and bootstrapped my list
     of local bbs's up from the one I initi-ally found  by  calling  a
     local  computer  store.  Boy  was  I suprised to find there is NO
     FIDO IN GAINSVILLE!  Imagine  a  university  town  with  all  the
     computer  science  students  and  NO  FIDO.   This  letter  is  a
     solicitation for anybody up there to start one.  If you want I'll
     modem you the software,  or even make another trip up to help you
     get one started.

     A  side  note:  prior to all this I searched the nodelist and did
     find one listed for Gainsville.  Node 101/345,  Alligator  Board,
     sysop Sharon King.  Unfortunately it is a private board.  I tried
     calling  Gainsville  info,  but  there  was no listing for Sharon
     King,  I tried sending a note via fidonet but never got a  reply.
     Funny  thing  is the board is listed as being in net 101 which is
     in Massachusetts!  If anybody can tell me how I can get in  touch
     with Sharon please let me know.

     Hi Guys,  just a quickie to let you know  that  the  UK  will  be
     represented  at  the conference in August.  My wife and I will be
     travelling out on the 5th of August to New York,  and  travelling
     on to Colorado. Can't wait to meet the other Fido sysops.

     St.  Louis sounds like a nice place. Hope to visit there too. Any
     offers to show us the sights would be greatly appreciated.

     I think it would be a good idea to start some  sort  of  exchange
     program with US sysops, any ideas? I think I will turn one of our
     lines over to run a Fido specifically for this purpose.

     I'll  be glad to turn my house over to a US visitor if he will do
     the same for us... sounds like fun....

     In the meantime any offers to show us the sights whiile we are in
     St Louis would be greatly appreciated....

     Bye for now.

              ALTERNATE LIFESTYLE(S) Conference with EchoMail

     There is a wide range of Alternate Lifestyles.  UTOPIAN QUEST  LI
     (107/269) has a special interest in options concerning sexual and
     sex  role  behavior,   partner  choice,   family  structure,  and
     polyfidelity.  Other Fidos will, of course, have other viewpoints
     on ALS.

     Can we use EchoMail to find our own E Pluribus Unum?
