     It seems that the water is about to boil in the Z1C electorial pot.
     Fingers pointing every direction. No one yet willing to openly agree
     on the proposed appointment of a temporary ZC to hold an election...
     or even when that will be.  Hello, RCC. The ball is in your court...

     David posted his *intention* to merge R14. Sysops here objected to it.
     Everyone who responded thought it was a bad decision.

     Nobody proposed that in the future he make no decisions without
     zone-wide referendum. The complaint was that he made a decision about
     a specific group of sysops without knowing what *those* sysops wanted.
     I hope that those sysops who spoke up were motivated by a fear of "it
     could happen to me."

     Had he responded to the protests there would have been hardly a ripple
     in the water. It was, after all, not a done deal.

     I'm not sure where the RCC needs to fit into this example, but if it
     had been the RCC who stated this intention, I'll bet the response
     would have been the same.

     I do agree with the proposal that the arcane RCC echo should be
     available as read-only to whomever wants it. People with comments
     could make them in their regional echos, netmail to their RC's, or
     here, depending on the scope of whatever point interested them.

     Dave says:
     Darrell keeps us very well informed about topics occupying the minds
     of the RCC. Foxey replies: It does not appear to be a two-way
     information flow, Dave, since other members of the RCC have stated
     that they =want= his input but do not seem to be getting it at
     anything like the frequency they would like...

     Darrell states:
     I serve the sysops, not the RCC. I couldn't care less what they think
     of the frequency of my posts or my level of involvement in their plans
     and discussions.

     When the sysops ask me to relay something to the RCC, whether I agree
     or not, I relay it. When the sysops ask me what is going on in there,
     I tell them. The only reason I relay at all is because I have access
     to the RCC echo and the sysops do not. Were the sysops to have access
     to that echo they could read what is going on themselves and could ask
     questions of the Z1C, the RCs, Satti, and whomever else gets invited.
     Personally, I think it's a rather silly arrangement the way it is now
     and it leaves everything open to interpretation. The echo should be
     made public or dissolved and brought into an already existent public
     forum.

     Your ol'editor feels the interest among sysops would be greatly
     enhanced if they had an inkling of the problems the NC/RCC deal with.
     Hiding their g-e-n-e-r-a-l chatter on the g-e-n-e-r-a-l day to day
     items that require their attention, is not a healthy way to build
     sysop level participation in the future.

     Sysops ignorance of the NC/RCC agendas severally and collectively,
     breeds the mistrust and snipping that is detrimental to harmony,
     training, and experience necessary to build a strong reliable future
     Fido network.

     IF data is so sensitive, or in a stage of development that would not
     be appropriate for general population at that particular moment, RCC
     knows how to use net&ip mails until it is ready for the "grunts"; but
     let them READ if they are interested enough... there may be an another
     great leader or two among them... RCC could designate another echo to
     WRITE questions, suggestions and comments to them by the sysops.

     By: Michael Grant
     To: Warren Bonner
      WB> I suggested in the distant past, that a "Election Chairman
     Office" be established on a permenamt bassis to handle elections.
     An ECO echo. The duties of this office could be handled by a
     designated RC, by the collective wisdom of the RCC.

     MG> I like this idea, Warren, but would take it a step further, and
     say why should a possible Election Chariman have to be an RC? It seems
     to me this is a very different thing from the duties of an RC, and
     could be handled quite aptly even by someone with no experience in
     nodelist processing. All that would be required would be some prior
     experience in running an election, and knowledge of the accepted
     guidelines. Furthermore, I feel if an RC were to take on this role, it
     could tend to be a fair-sized distraction to his RC duties.

     WB> Point well taken. Sysop be appointed by collective consensus of
     the RCC....  would that work?

     No one's blaming you for that and no one can predict the future. At
     least FIDOPOLS would have been a public forum where interested parties
     could have voiced their opinions. As the moderator you could have kept
     the threads on track and progress could have been made by involving
     the right people, the sysops. Dave Hamilton pointed me towards the
     echo some months back and I 'fixed it, but it was too late apparently.

     Just thinking out loud here but I still maintain that too much is
     expected of *Cs and there is not enough sysop involvement. *Cs should
     be left to tend to nodelist duties and the real direction and decision
     making should be left to the sysops of which there are many capable
     ones. A *C with too many responsibilities can quickly become
     overwhelmed with work and expectations no matter how hard they try.
     Besides their nodelist duties a lot of them pull extra-duty as mail
     movers, representatives, arbitrators, bean counters, new- sysop
     advisors, moderators, etc. with the result being that few of these
     jobs get done as well as they might and the *Cs and the sysops lose
     FIDONEWS 18-01               Page 4                   13 Nov 2000


     sight of the hobby. *Cs get super-experienced and the sysops get left
     out and disinterested.

     If David had stuck to tending the nodelist would he have been able to
     serve out his term? I don't know but I'd guess he probably could and
     if he couldn't, wouldn't it be great to know that there are lots of
     sysops around with experience tending the nodelist? David could have
     come to the sysops and said 'hey guys, I'm just too busy these days to
     carry on in this role'. The sysops could have selected someone and
     sent him on his way. Done deal! Same goes for any *C. But when you've
     got a *C that has hung on to the job seemingly forever like Satti did,
     and when *Cs pass the jobs amongst each other instead of bringing in
     new faces and fresh blood, it appears to me almost everyone around
     them drops off and loses interest.

     Most of the sysops here are involved in the jobs of Fidonet to some
     degree. If each of us did a job for a while and handed off that job to
     someone new fairly regularly, in a few short years you'd have loads of
     involved, knowledgable, sysops. You wouldn't have the large gap of
     sysops that know what's going on and ones that don't. Sure there'll
     always be those that simply don't want to get involved but there's no
     way that every capable sysop in this hobby is being given the
     opportunity to contribute and without those contributions this network
     is going to continue to falter.

                                 ARTICLES
     =================================================================


     Hi folks, I have some articles submitted to me for publication this
     week. I had originally formatted them and installed them here.

     On final reading I was not happy with the way different articles
     clashed with each other's representations. Particularly do not want
     to let the Snooze become a Fight Arena.  Although no derogatory names
     were called, names were mentioned and accusations were made.

     So I have pulled them out of this issue as the other Zones do not
     want to wade through a quarrelsome atmosphere.  I still want your
     articles, but not combative hurtful articles, rather enlightening
     items preferably composed by yourselves.

     How about these subject: "Proposal complete with rules for elections
     of all levels"; "Proposal for expanding the Snooze to have a PDF
     issue"; "Proposal for a rewritten Policy"...ect  Ed-P-T

     If you have money in the bank, in your wallet, and spare change in a

     If your parents are still married and alive, you are very rare, even

     If you hold up your head with a smile on your face and are truly

                          Golf Interruptions

     It's Saturday morning.  Bob's just about to set off on a round of golf
     when  he realizes that he forgot to tell his wife that the guy who
     fixes the washing machine is coming around at noon.

     So Bob heads back to the clubhouse and phones home.

     "Hello" Says a little girl's voice. "Hi, honey, it's Daddy," says Bob.
     "Is Mommy near the phone?"

     "No, Daddy.  She's upstairs in the bedroom with Uncle Frank."

     After a brief pause, Bob says,

     "But you haven't got an Uncle Frank, Honey!"

     "Yes, I do, and he's upstairs in the bedroom with Mommy!"

     "Okay, then.  Here's what I want you to do.  Put down the phone, run
     upstairs and knock on the bedroom door and shout to Mommy and Uncle
     Frank that my car's just pulled up outside the house."

     "Okay, Daddy!"

     A few minutes later, the little girl comes back to the phone. "Well, I
     did what you said, Daddy."

     "And what happened?"

     "Well, Mommy jumped out of bed with no clothes on and ran around
     screaming; then she tripped over the rug and fell down the stairs and
     she's just lying there.  I think she's dead."

     Oh my God!  And what about Uncle Frank?"

     "He jumped out of bed with no clothes on, and he was all scared and he
     jumped out the back window into the swimming pool.  But he must have
     forgot that last week you took out all the water to clean it, so he
     hit  the bottom of the swimming pool and is just lying there, not
     moving. I think he may be dead, too."

     There is a long pause, then Bob says,

     "Swimming pool? Is this 854-7039?"

                     Web Page - http://texoma.net/~flv


     Collin County Station's Web Page has undergone some major changes. For
     those that were linking to the old "http://texoma.net/~flv/ccs.htm"
     address, please remove the "ccs.htm" from there and just leave the
     "/~flv".

     What's new??

     1. Relocated the page to a sub-directory on the server and made a
     separate directory for images. It's easier to keep track of stuff this
     way. :)

     2. The pages were getting crowded and hard for me to manage, so I went
     with a "frames" format and a pull down men (java script) to get
     around with. I think it looks and works a lot better.

     3. Sorted through the pages and put some stuff in categories. You'll
     notice this the most in the "software" links. Man, they were a mess!
     :-))

     4. Did some cosmetic changes and created some graphics as well as
     removed some things.

     I hope you'll find this site easier to navigate and better all around.
     Drop in a check it out. For those of you that have been there before,
     drop back by. For those that have never checked it out, please do.
     Either way, let me know if everything is working and what you think.
     :-)

     Have a great day,

                         Did you know...?
                           -= TAPS =-
                From a fellow Veteran of Foreign Wars

     We have all heard the haunting song, "Taps." It's the song that gives
     us that lump in our throats and usually creates tears in our eyes.
     But, do you know the story behind the song?  If not, I think you will
     be pleased to find out about it's humble beginnings.

     Reportedly, it all began in 1862 during the Civil War, when Union Army
     Captain Robert Ellicombe was with his men near Harrison's Landing in
     Virginia. The Confederate Army was on the other side of the narrow
     strip of land.

     During the night, Captain Ellicombe heard the moans of a soldier who
     lay severely wounded on the field. Not knowing if it was a Union or
     Confederate soldier, the Captain decided to risk his life and bring
     the stricken man back for medical attention. Crawling on his stomach
     through the gunfire, the Captain reached the stricken soldier and
     began pulling him toward his encampment.

     When the Captain finally reached his own lines, he discovered it was
     actually a Confederate soldier, but the soldier was dead. The Captain
     lit a lantern and suddenly caught his breath and went numb with shock.
     In the dim light, he saw the face of the soldier. It was his own son.
     The boy had been studying music in the south when the war broke out.
     Without telling his father, the boy enlisted in the Confederate Army.

     The following morning, heartbroken, the father asked permission of his
     superiors to give his son a full military burial despite his enemy
     status. His request was only partially granted. The Captain had asked
     if he could have a group of Army band members play a funeral dirge for
     his son at the funeral. The request was turned down since the soldier
     was a Confederate. But, out of respect for the father, they did say
     they could give him only one musician.

     The Captain chose a bugler. He asked the bugler to play a series of
     musical notes he had found on a piece of paper in the pocket of the
     dead youth's uniform. This wish was granted.  The haunting melody, we
     now know as "Taps" used at military funerals, was born.

     Day is done
     Gone the sun
     From the Lakes
     From the hills
     From the sky.
     All is well, safely rest.
     God is nigh.

     Fading light
     Dims the sight
     And a star

     Gems the sky,
     Gleaming bright
     From afar,
     Drawing nigh,
     Falls the night.

     Thanks and praise,
     For our days,
     Neath the sun,
     Neath the stars,
     Neath the sky,
     As we go,
     This we know,
     God is nigh.

     We have all felt the chills while listening to "Taps" but I have never
     seen all the words to the song until now. I didn't even know there was
     more than one verse. I also never knew the story behind the song and I
     didn't know if you had either so I thought I'd pass it along.

     I now have an even deeper respect for the song than I did before.

     Ten weeks would have been more than enough to carry this off.

      AS> Straight 10 weeks, sure.  Throw in the US Election,
      AS> Thanksgiving, Hanukah/Christmas and New Year's and I really
      AS> can't think of a worse time to hold an election all year.


     I slept on this before I answered, Andrea, and I came to the
     conclusion that there is no ten-week period in the year that's
     convenient to all for an election because so many look at an election
     as an interruption in their lives, a duty that they perform merely to
     discharge the obligation, or  just a PITA and an interruption in their
     lives.  Summer elections are out of the question due to vacations,
     yet our state has it's Primary election in July at the peak of the
     vacation season.  The ones who care, vote.

     What you are saying is that this is the worst time of the year for
     you.

     The fact is that we *need* an election *now*, irrespective of the
     inconvenience that it might cause for a few, or for many, if your
     assessment is corrrect, and elections are held because of need, not
     convenience.  It would take about 15 minutes a day to read the
     meaningful posts in a general election, most of Z1 won't spend *that*
     much time reading them.  Most of Z1 doesn't care who's in charge.  I
     know that you know how to sort through the posts and eliminate the
     background noise, concentrating on the posts that matter; can you find
     15 minutes a day?

     Hold the election, pick a replacement for Mouf so that he can get on
     with the things that have  priority in his life and the few who
     actually *care* about who's running this ranch will find the time.


     None of this is gonna happen, though; I hope we have a temp Z1C
     appointed by 5 JAN.

                             GETTING TECHNICAL
     =================================================================

          Since no real technostuff was submitted this week...
          I thought a little insight into the service dept....

                         IDIOTS IN SERVICE:

     This week, all our office phones went dead and I had to contact the
     telephone repair people.  They promised to be out between 8:00 a.m.and
     7:00 p.m.  When I asked if they could give me a smaller time window,
     the pleasant gentleman asked, "Would you like us to call you before we
     come?"   I replied that I didn't see how he would be able to do that,
     since our phones weren't working.  He also requested that we report
     future outages by email (Does YOUR email work without a telephone
     line?).
     --------------------------------------------------------------------

                         IDIOTS AT WORK:

     I was signing the receipt for my credit card purchase when the clerk
     noticed I had never  signed my name on the back of the credit card.
     She informed me that she could not  complete the transaction unless
     the card was signed.   When I asked why, she explained that it was
     necessary to ompare the signature I had just signed  on the receipt.
     So I signed the credit  card in front of her. She carefully  compared
     the signature to the one I had just  signed on the receipt. As luck
     would have it, they  matched.
     --------------------------------------------------------------------

                         IDIOTS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD:

     I live in a semi-rural  area.  We recently had a new neighbor call the
     local township administrative office to request the removal of the
     Deer Crossing sign on our road.  The reason:  too many deer were being
     hit by cars and he didn't want them to cross there  anymore.
     --------------------------------------------------------------------
                        IDIOT SIGHTING #1:

     I was at the airport, checking in at the  gate when an airport
     employee asked, "Has anyone put anything in your baggage without your
     knowledge?" To which I replied, "If it was without my  knowledge, how
     would I know?" He smiled knowingly and nodded, "That's why we ask."
     --------------------------------------------------------------------

                         IDIOT SIGHTING #2:

     The stoplight on the  corner buzzes when it's safe to cross the
     street. I was crossing with an intellectually-challenged coworker of
     mine when she asked if I knew what the buzzer was for.  I explained
     that it signals blind people when the light  is red. Appalled, she
     responded,  "What on earth are blind people doing driving?!"
     --------------------------------------------------------------------

                         IDIOT SIGHTING #3:

     At a good-bye luncheon for an old and dear co-worker who was let go by
     the  company due to "down-sizing", our manager  commented cheerfully,
     "This is fun. We should do this more often".  Not a word was spoken.
     We all just looked at each other with that deer-in-the-headlights
     stare.
     --------------------------------------------------------------------

                         IDIOT SIGHTING #4:

     I work with an individual who plugged her power strip back into itself
     and for the life of her couldn't understand why her system would not
     turn on.
     --------------------------------------------------------------------

                         IDIOT SIGHTING #5:

     When my husband and I arrived at an automobile dealership to pick up
     our car, we were told the keys had been locked in it.  We went to the
     service  department and found a mechanic working feverishly to unlock
     the  driver's side door.  As I watched from the passenger side, I
     instinctively tried the door handle and discovered that it was
     unlocked. "Hey," I announced to the technician, "It's open!" To which
     he replied, "I know - I already got  that side."
     --------------------------------------------------------------------

                        NOW DON'T YOU FEEL BETTER?

     Re: What do you think???   01
     [...]
     The other side of the coin, of course, is that I think we also need to
     ask whether any of those older 8-bit systems are still members of
     FidoNet. I mean, if they're not then maybe we should take this
     opportunity to consider some _real_ technical improvements! [:)
     [....]
     I did also, as you say, come across a couple of websites which were
     offering the current FidoNews online, ostensibly in HTML format
     (although perhaps merely in <PRE>formated monospaced text).

     You've got me wondering, however, whether anyone has made a .PDF ->
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     .HTML converter. They've done .PDF -> .TXT, why not HTML????

     this is just a draft and it's getting reviewed and updated even now.
     Some things are being clarified better.

     If you have any input, please say so and comment on it.

     Lets see if this one suits 'well enough'.  Tweaking of dates based on
     how fast folks here can say they like it.

     Draft 1, 10NOV Version C- RC's choicebased on region input. (notes,
     timetable to be adjusted later)

                      ZONE 1 COORDINATOR ELECTION - 2000

        The Z1C has announced an election, for a new Z1C. Per Policy4, the
     ZC is elected by the RC's under them.  It is the choice of the RC's to
     do this by the following method per P4 section 6.2.

        A Z1 Sysop is defined as any Sysop who is nodelisted and located
     within the normal geographical boundries of zone 1.

        The nodelist used will be the nodelist.### version.  Reasonable
     exceptions will be made if a node or net is accidently dropped from
     this version.  The term 'nodelisted' means listed in this version of
     the nodelist.

                                 Nominations

               Nominating time table: NOV 12-25, 2000
               All dates start at 00:00 and end at 00:00 EST

         Any nodelisted Z1 Sysop of Fidonet may nominate themselves or
     another nodelisted Sysop of Z1 Fidonet for the position of Z1C.  The
     nomination must be made in the Z1C_Election echo and be addressed to
     the Election Coordinator.

     (edit note, 2 assistants have volunteered and could be used at this
     phase?)

     FIDONEWS 18-01               Page 16                  13 Nov 2000


         The nomination must include the name of the nominee and their
     Fidonet node number.

         Once a nomination has been received by the election coordinator,
     the nominee's name will be added to the list.  The nomination must
     then be accepted by the nominee and seconded by a Z1 Sysop in the echo
     to become a fully eligible candidate.

                Discussion Period NOV 26- DEC 02, 2000
               All dates start at 00:00 and end at 00:00 EST

         Following the nomination period, a period shall be allowed for
         each candidate to campaign for the position.  During this
         period, questioning of the candidates is encouraged.  Flaming
         is not.

               Regional Feedback Period  DEC 03-16, 2000
               All dates start at 00:00 and end at 00:00 EST

         Following the campaign period, a period shall be allowed for each
     region to conduct selection proceedings in accordance with regional
     policy and such methods as are determined as appropriate based on
     regional policy or the desires of the Sysops within that region.

         Your RC will inform you on exactly how this is to be done.

             Regional Coordinator Voting - DEC 17-22, 2000
               All dates start at 00:00 and end at 00:00 EST

         Following collection of regional input, the RC's shall cast their
     vote in the Z1C_ELECTION echo.  The candidate with the most votes,
     wins.  If there is a tie and there are more than 2 candidates, a
     revote with the top 2 candidates will commence.

                            Term begin/end:

         Upon completion of the election, the newly elected Z1C's term

     a @ preceding an individual's name implies a virtual email

     time between when the message is received, and when it is
     sent on to other nodes, or available to be sent onward,
     defined in minutes. A latency of ! implies that there is an
     immediate response, and an attempt to deliver immediately
