                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================


     [Editor's note:    This  week  marks  the  fifth  anniversary  of
     FidoNet's  present multiple  net  organization.    We  took  this
     occasion to invite Ken Kaplan to write a guest editorial.]


     This week  multinet  FidoNet  is celebrating it's fifth birthday.
     It  seems  quite   appropriate  that  current  world  events  are
     "proclaiming an end of  the  Cold  War  and  calling  for a joint
     venture in a new world  order".    FidoNet is also heading into a
     new  age  of  cooperation, cooling tempers,  and  new  democratic
     selection  procedures for its leaders.  FidoNet  is  one  of  the
     oldest  public networks and yet it has only  reached  a  maturity
     level now prepared to enter kindegarden.  My son Eric and FidoNet
     are the same age and it has been interesting over  the  past five
     years to watch them both grow and mature.

     The FidoNet *C's have their own bit of history.  In the beginning
     there was a single tier  network  and  no *C's as I was doing all
     the  data  collection,  hand  editing,  and   publishing  of  the
     nodelist.  The nodelist was split into Networks and Regions right
     after the St Louis FidoCon on June 12th  1985.   Zone's came many
     months later.  The original RC's were located in  places  outside
     of  major  metropolitan  areas and were there primarily to handle
     SYSOP's who could not locate in a network.  They had little to do
     and complained quite a bit.  In the meantime I still had too much
     of the  workload.    A  few  months  after the original Jeff Rush
     echomail  processor  was   released  (Summer  '86)  I  started  a
     conference called REGCON between all the RC's and that's when the
     first RC's started getting organized  and  writing  Policy.   The
     RC's  were  not really a major  factor  in  the  control  of  the
     formation of the Nodelist until late '87  when Ben Baker released
     MAKENL  which  allowed  the  RC's  to create their  own  nodelist
     segment.  MAKENL was further enhanced in '88 to  allow  the  NC's
     and even HUB's to prepare their own segment and that's  when  the
     power  of  the NC's came into play.  The control of  the  FidoNet
     Nodelist eventually  fanned out like a funnel stating with myself
     doing everything to  the  process  of  today  where  all  of *C's
     throughout the world are now involved.

     I keep getting asked where is all this heading?  What does future
     hold for FidoNet over the  next  decade?   Computers keep getting
     faster  and  more efficient and FidoNet's  developers  must  keep
     ahead of the pace if the network  is  to  survive.    FidoNet has
     truly brought the world a little closer together  and that effort
     will continue into the ninties.  The next five  years  should  be
     very entertaining as well as exciting.  I would send  you  all  a
     piece of FidoNet Birthday cake, but the one in our house only has
     Ninja Turtles.

     FidoCon '90 Update: 6/11/90

     We have good news, better news, and great news for you this week!

     The good news is that registrations have skyrocketed, and we can
     now say that we're confident this is going to be the biggest and
     most enjoyable FidoCon in years!

     The better news is that due to the increasing number of regis-
     trations, we've cancelled the July 1st pricing, and have settled
     on giving everyone the last $50 discount!

     The great news is that we're even ROLLING BACK prices for some
     of the plans!  The conference only, conference & banquet, and
     spouse plan have been reduced to their original May 1st prices
     of $75, $105, and $620.

     [However, if you plan on attending and staying for meals or at
     the hotel, we MUST know whether you're coming by July 1st, as
     that is our cut-off date for notifying the hotel of our 'final'
     numbers.  If you register after that, we cannot guarantee you a
     room or a meal ticket.]

     There's other news, as well.  Chris Irwin (author of D'bridge)
     has told us he's coming.  That means that the author of virtually
     every major mailer package will be attending to tell you about
     their programs!

     Ryugen Fisher of Blue Frog Micro Computing will also be
     speaking.  "Old Frog's" going to give a talk on the future of
     system architecture called "You Can Always Catch the Next Bus".
     Hector Santos and Silver Xpress Software will be attending and
     giving a seminar on off-line mail readers.

     Telecomputing Magazine will be attending and giving a seminar,
     as will Dr. James Waldron of UNITEX, the United Nations Press
     Release and UNICEF information service.

     The Tomorrow's Children Foundation will be participating to tell
     us how local sysops have helped children enjoy their stay at the
     Hackensack Medical Center while being treated for cancer.

     Chuck Gorish and Bennett Griffin of the GeneSys Project will be
     demoing their new multi-line continuous mail version of the
     Phoenix BBS program.

     US Robotics, as well as giving a talk on their new v.42bis
     upgrade and other new products, has graciously donated an HST
     9600 baud modem to our prize pool.

     Speaking of prizes, our pool of vendor hardware and software
     continues to grow!  The earlier you register, the more chances
     you'll have to win!  Registrations after 7/1 will not be
     eligible (we have to have SOME inducements for early
     registration, you know! :-)

     [Those registering before 5/1 will be given 3 changes in the
     drawings, while those registering before 6/1 will be given 2. If
     you register before July 1st, you can also participate in our
     prize drawings.  Rumor has it we'll be making an announcement of
     a 'super prize' any day now, so keep tuned to this channel.]

     Please use the updated registration form you'll find in this
     issue of Fidonews.  It's headed FIDO-CON '90 REGISTRATION FORM
     to take advantage of our new pricing.  We hope to see you there!

     Bill VanGlahn, FidoCon '90 committee chairman, 1:1/90 1:107/557

                               NEW ECHOS

          I thought I would take this oportunity to anounce that
     there are two new echos available which might be of interest
     to some of you.

     -=R&R=-
          The R&R Echo is an offshoot from the dBase and Clipper
     echos, where discussions concering the use of "Report Writer"
     software for dBase was building.  The R&R echo is dedicated to
     discussing the use and implimentation of report writing software
     used by many dBase/Foxbase/DBXL, etc., programmers.  This covers
     both commercial and shareware versions and can be of immence
     help to those using these programs.  The echo is open to any
     individual with interest in this type of software.
     Symbolic Name (TAG) - R&R


     -=RA_UTIL=-
          The RA_UTIL Echo is dedicated to discussions concerning the
     many "external" programs being written for the Remote Access BBS
     software package.  The participants include many of the authors
     of such programs and the discussions range from "problem solving"
     to what is upcoming in the future.  "Support" program authors,
     very often need a place to offer assistance for their users and
     do not always wish to utilize the primary BBS echo, the RA_UTIL
     Echo is available for their use.  The echo is open to anyone who
     has interest in the external programs written for Remote Access
     and "authors" wishing to discuss what they are doing.
     Symbolic Name (TAG) - RA_UTIL

     =================================================================

     From:   Jim Dailey of 202/309.0
     To:     Vince Perriello of 1/1.0
     Subj:   Fnews Vol 7, Num 23 - June 4, 1990

     I won't include it here as I am sure you have a copy of Policy 4.
     Section  1.3.6 contain  wording  on  the  use  of  Fido  Net  for
     commercial purposes.

     The above referenced issue  of Fido News has an article on "Short
     Story Disk" and "Electronic Book Club".

     These  articles  do  not represent  an  exchange  of  information
     between commercial interests and customers instead,  the articles
     represent a clear act of solicitation.

     My question - is Fido News, the offical news letter of Fidonet(r)
     International    BBS   Network,  exempt  from  the  policies  and
     procedures set forth in the current policy, Policy 4.

     [Editor's response:

     I wasn't really sure how to classify those submissions.  I always
     intended to publish them, but at first I was going to  do so with
     an associated editorial stating that I would not publish anything
     like it again unless the readers thought I should.

     Then I read  the  stuff  again while attempting to look at things
     more from the public  service  side of things, and decided that I
     had gotten too sensitive.   The  stuff  seemed to be a reasonable
     thing for one sysop to announce  to his fellow sysops, as long as
     it didn't become some kind of Kalah/Superdots kind of repeater.

     Obviously you read those things the way  I did at first.  Perhaps
     my first opinion was correct.  Of course, maybe you could try the
     same  process  I  went  through  and  arrive at the  same  SECOND
     conclusion that I reached.

     Now that it has become an issue, I suppose the  only  thing to do
     is to  invite  commentary.   Was this stuff blatantly commercial?
     If so, is  it  the kind of commercial stuff we want to read here?
     (Examples of stuff we seem to want to read here would be USR, SEA
     etc announcements which are most definitely commercial in nature)

     Comments welcome.  Preferably in ARTSPEC.DOC format with filename
     (something).LET. ]
