                  FidoNet: Stand Up Now or Watch it Die


     I just heard something about Randy Edwards that appalls me.  Oh,
     not what HE's said or done, but what is being done to him.  It
     seems that someone out there has decided that Randy's
     controversial and rather vociferous opinions have justified, in
     return, certain threats against himself and his family, telephone
     harrassment of them, and attempts to crash his system.

     This type of response is absolutely wrong.

     Some might argue that to quite some extent, Randy deserves what
     he gets, in that his behavior has also resulted in a crashed
     system or two and he has certainly abused the hospitality of
     others who freely provide certain resources for specific purposes
     other than those pursued by Randy.  But for the most part Randy,
     through overzealousness, is only guilty of certain
     insensitivities of the rights of others and the other results
     have been inadvertant by-products.

     But, regardless of his own level of any culpability, two wrongs
     never make a right -- and the escalation in this situation has
     moved beyond the realm of insensitivity of the rights of others
     to out-and-out anti-social behavior and illegality.  Make no
     mistake about it: telephone harrassment is illegal, regardless of
     whatever form it takes and it should be something that FidoNet
     totally stands against, instead of, unfortunately, being an
     uninvolved party to its promotion.

     To quite some extent, what we see now is the unsurprising result
     of not taking stands in the past to protect the rights of others.
     On far too many occasions, individuals have been unjustly
     attacked or harrassed and the Net has sat by with a collective,
     "So what?" attitude instead of speaking out against such
     practices or seeking to effect a just disposition of such cases
     as have been brought forward.

     The result of such inaction is that now we have an atmosphere
     where freedom of dissent - no, freedom of any opinion - is
     likely to bring about personal attacks and where escalation into
     illegality is becoming a norm.  The eventual result of this can
     only be the destruction of that ideal of FidoNet and the
     wonderful benefits it could provide to so much of society.

     Randy has questioned why IFNA should exist.  Well, he's certainly
     discovered one of the primary reasons: as a non-profit,
     FidoNews 5-13                Page 2                   28 Mar 1988


     educational body, IFNA sees as one of its main priorities the
     formation and distribution of certain basic policies and
     procedures that are designed to safe-guard the rights of
     individuals thereby giving them the protections to freely
     continue in their personal "pursuit of happiness."  Everyone,
     within FidoNet or not, should have the right to say, do, or
     experience anything they wish that, in turn, does not interfere
     with those same rights for others.

     But the net as a whole cannot just stand by and "let IFNA do it"
     or hope that perhaps someone else will speak out against
     injustices.  If you believe in the perpetuation of FidoNet you
     must now take a stand against any and all such practices as have
     been directed against Randy and others.  Each and every one of
     you should call for a stop of these blatant violations of rights
     and should demand that those in positions of authority take all
     necessary steps to see that the indiviuals responsibile for such
     acts be removed from FidoNet and that clear guidelines exist to
     prevent reoccurrences.

     This stand must be taken NOW, before it's too late -- if, indeed,
     it's not too late already.

                           Public Key Encryption

            I have seen a few referances to Public Key Encryption
     recently and since I claim to actually know something about the
     subject, I thought I would try to clear up a few misconceptions.

            Let me start with a bit of history. Some time ago people
     were thinking about electronic communication (lets call it email
     even if most of what I plan to say could also be applied to other
     forms of communications like voice phone calls).  This was quite a
     while before Fidonet. They thought that for email to be really
     usefull people need to have confidence in the confidentiality of
     their messages. To be honest it is just too easy to eavesdrop on
     email.

            These people thought that encryption was the best way to
     ensure confidential email. Other ways are possible but they all
     tend to rely on some form of trust in one way or another. Now
     there is nothing wrong with trusting someone but in practice it is
     depressingly rare.

            In fact various form of encryption were and are in common
     use for email already. They generally use a, so called, key which
     is used to translate, so called, plain text into a secure form
     before transmision and then used again to reverse the process
     after transmision. So to send a confidential email message you
     first must agree on a key since, of course, if you try to use
     different keys, you won't be able to reverse the original
     conversion appropriatly.

            This is where the problem comes up. How do you find out
     what key was used to encrypt the original message.  The
     conventional answer is that you use a separate channel of
     comunications for agreeing on keys. If you use a telephone for the
     encrypted messages, then you send the key via the post office or a
     courier or an armed gaurd depending on how serious you are.

            This is where the Public Key Encryption idea started.
     Theses people wanted to use the same channels of communication for
     their keys as they used for the confidential email. They wanted to
     do away with the couriers and the post office and all the
     rigamarole but they did not want to give up the security that had
     been already accomplished. It is pretty obvious that you couldn't
     just put the key to decodeing your message right in front of the
     message since then ANYONE listening in could decode and then read
     your message.

            What was eventually figured out was that it IS possible to
     first send a message telling someone how to ENCODE a message which
     is then sent BACK to the original person and still have a secure
     message. For instance I can tell you how to scramble a message in
     a certain way so that only I can read it. Anyone listening in will
     FidoNews 5-13                Page 4                   28 Mar 1988


     only find out how to scramble messages and they will also have a
     copy of the scrambled message that you eventually send me but they
     can't unscramble the message to find out what you are saying to
     me.

            The only practical and secure way of actually implementing
     such a system discovered so far is generally refered to as the RSA
     Public Key Encryption system. It is based on an article called "A
     Method for Obtaining Digital Signatures and Public-Key
     Cryptosystems" writen by R.L.Rivest, A.Shamir and L.Adleman
     published in the February 1978 issue of Comunications of the ACM.

            The system they discovered is based on very large prime
     numbers. The larger the numbers, the more secure the system
     becomes. Keys based on numbers of the size we contend with every
     day up to millions or billions are pretty easy to decode even if
     you don't know the key. However it is possible to set up keys with
     hundreds of digits and almost guarantee that no one will ever be
     able to decode the messages without the key.

            The process actually produces two different, but related
     keys. One part is used to encrypt or scramble the original message
     and the other part is then kept to yourself and used to unscramble
     the message. One you have produced a pair of keys, you can give
     out the first part to anyone that wants to send confidential
     messages to you. The half of the key that you give out is refered
     to as a Public Key because you send it out over the public
     comunications channel and it doesn't matter who knows it.

            If you want to send a private message to someone you must
     first get their public key. For two-way communication there is two
     sets of keys involved. Two public keys and two private secret
     keys. The public keys are exchanged before any confidential
     exchanges can take place.

            In fact you can publish your public key so that it is
     public knowledge. For instance I have generated a key for myself
     to use. It is:

       n = 2736819260645630669527694759316520435577
           74311021562498273154432038898470487
       e = 1318658420201053439930112933655370300596
           0307881881836602807819529828909731

            I had to break the numbers up to fit on these lines. They
     are about 75 digits each. This key is considered to be of
     "moderate" security. A high security key would consist of numbers
     of 150 to 200 digits each. Note that the two numbers above are
     just the one public key. There is a third number to go with the
     two above that is the private part of my key. Now you can use this
     key to send me absolutly (practicly speaking) confidential
     messages.

            About this time you might be saying "Now wait just a
     minute, what do I do with these big numbers? I don't think my
     computer will even understand numbers that big!" and you are
     FidoNews 5-13                Page 5                   28 Mar 1988


     perfectly justified in asking. As it happens, your computer WILL
     handle numbers like those well enough. You just need the right
     programs. To make it easier for you I have created a program to do
     all the RSA ecryption and decryption work for you. It will even
     generate the big number keys for you to have your own personal
     public keys. The encryption and decryption processes work with
     disk files on your MS-DOS computer. I called the program PKSCrypt
     and it is currently released at version 0.2a. You can call my Fido
     and download the file (called pkscrypt.arc) on your first call.
     (1-403-282-1703 no file requests though, sorry)

            If you actually go to the trouble of getting a copy of the
     program and play around with it, you will quickly find out why
     this system is not going to replace the conventional encryption
     systems.  It is very slow. For example it will take about 15
     minutes to encrypt a 1000 byte file using my key on a PC (give or
     take a few minutes). In fact it is so slow that you might think it
     is completely useless. Before we forget about the whole idea,
     remember what the original problem was. All we need to encrypt is
     the key for one of the standard encryption methods so that we can
     send it over our standard communications channel.

            Lets get more specific for a minute. Most of the readers of
     Fidonews are sysops on fidonet and I suspect that most of you are
     familiar with Bob Hartman's ConfMail system. Confmail has a built
     in encryption system of the conventional type. Some of you out
     there are probably already using this feature to make some of your
     links secure. You must have agreed with your corespondents on a
     key. Perhaps you just sent the other sysop a private message. You
     probably didn't and wouldn't have any trouble with such an
     arrangement BUT it is remotly possible that for the same reason
     that you descided to use the encryption in the first place, that
     key could have gone astray. You would be no better off than if you
     didn't bother at all.

            Maybe you thought of that and just phoned up the other
     sysop voice and told him the key. The only problem here is that
     the voice call is more expensive, in general, than a fidonet
     message since it is during daytime, higher rates and it usually
     will be longer in duration than a network call.

            However, if you knew the public encryption key of the sysop
     who you wanted to send the ConfMail key to, you could encrypt the
     ConfMail key with his public key. That way, only the person who
     knows the secret part of the key could decrypt your message and
     discover the ConfMail key. You can pretty safely assume that only
     one person will know that secret key. You can then send the
     resulting message over the regular insecure links.

            You can easily use the public key encryption to scramble
     the relativly small ConfMail key. You can still use the relatively
     fast and convientient encryption that is built into ConfMail for
     the bulk of the traffic. And you can do it all over Fidonet with
     the cheap communications possible with this medium.

            The topic of "digital signatures" was breifly touched upon.
     FidoNews 5-13                Page 6                   28 Mar 1988


     As it turns out the RSA public key encryption can also be used for
     identification purposes. It is possible to use the private key to
     create a, so called, signature which can be verified with that
     person's public key. While this would seem to be usefull to us on
     Fidonet also, it turns out that it is not as practical due to the
     slow speed of the algorithms. If you get my package, I talk about
     digital signatures some more in the dox that come with it.

            There are other, more controversial, applications of
     encryption techniques. If you are using regular netmail, but your
     mail is being routed through another node and perhaps you think
     the sysop of the intermediate system is reading your private
     messages, you could either "no-route" your mail or you could
     continue to use the same route but encrypt your messages. Most of
     us agree that a host or hub should pass along ANY traffic that he
     has promised to deliver but what would you say if the messages
     were encrypted? You might ask first of all, why is this person
     bothering to encrypt his messages? Is it because he is doing
     something illegal?

             Some places might even have laws about such practices (the
     cops think they should have the right to read your mail and listen
     to your phone calls even if they need to ask a judge about it
     first and some other government agentcies seem to have similar
     ideas). Of course none of us do anything along those lines do we?
     O:-)

            What about our pet crime - software piracy? If the pirates
     want to operate on the net they might be able to do it right under
     our noses. If you allow encrypted messages for any reason, you
     will not be able to prevent any other uses of the same techniques.
     One encrypted message looks just like any other encrypted message.

            You may have noticed, I have not come out and promised this
     system will BE secure for all time. That is only because it has
     not been PROVEN to be secure in a mathematical sense. I am very
     confident of the security of the system but it may be possible
     that tommorow someone will find a simple and cheap way to beat it.
     This situation is not unique to the RSA system. It is actually
     true of most of the modern encryption systems still in use today.
     The primary exceptions are the ones which have been broken. It
     seems that it is much harder to prove that a system is secure than
     it is to come up with the idea in the first place, all of which
     isn't really that surprizing.

     MetroFire - 135/14


                  FireNet Echo Recap for the Neophyte

     Those of you new to FidoNet may have heard of FireNet but may
     not be sure what FireNet is or what it does. Herein lies a
     brief synopsis.

     Shortly after getting into FidoNet back in early 1985, it
     occurred to me that the FidoNet structure was such that it
     could lend itself very well all sorts of spin-off sub-nets.
     Having set up this system for the fire department I work for
     (Metro-Dade Fire & Rescue in greater Miami)as an experiment,
     I began to toy with the idea that a private Net could be
     created that would allow direct and convenient message
     communication between participating departments. The software
     was readily available, operated on most standard machines and
     modems, and could be configured specifically for fire depart-
     ment use.

     I began to write articles for FidoNews on the subject and
     began contacting other departments and fire service types who
     might be cajoled into participating in such a venture.

     At that time, special interest Nets existed in FidoNet (since
     abandonded as redundant) so I applied for and received the
     number Net 911 (now operating as a private Net) and started
     gathering interested systems.

     It wasn't until the advent of Jeff Rush's famous Echomail
     programs that the real potential of the original idea began
     to emerge. Woody Wood and Chuck Sanders of the Colorado
     Springs Fire Department and I began to exchange ideas and
     plans and Woody and Chuck got Echomail installed on their
     system and began to link-in other FidoNet systems. Echomail
     was much easier to hook into for established systems and
     gave a new dimension to the original concept of a sub-Net
     or private Nodelist. For one thing, Echomail allowed users
     to participate without having to set up a system, first.
     All anyone had to do was find a system carrying FireNet and
     enter messages. This is how many departments first became
     aware of the Echo. Many of those departments went on to set
     up full-fledged FidoNet systems.

     FireNet is now carried on the Echomail Backbone and has many
     participating systems and even more users. A detailed account
     of the structure of FireNet is in the works and will be related
     in this forum by Chuck and Woody in a future article.

     Basically, FireNet is an Echo conference devoted to the Fire,
     EMS (Emergency Medical Services) and Public Safety sector. We
     discuss equipment, procedures, service related software,
     hazardous materials, service related legislation and other
     topics directly related to the Fire Services. It has been a

     valuable tool in communication and dissemination of bulletins
     and warnings.

     FireNet is available to anyone who has an interest in the Fire/
     Rescue Services. It is available from the Host and western Hub
     (FireNet Leader, 128/16), from the eastern Hub (MetroFire,
     135/14), or from the Echo Backbone. It is a moderated conference
     that anyone may read or post Fire/Rescue Service messages of
     international interest. A list of the systems carrying FireNet
     will appear in the Sanders/Wood article soon to be published.

     If you get a link into FireNet from the Backbone or your
     Regional Echo Coordinator, please let Woody or Chuck know about
     it by sending a Netmail message to 128/16. We are trying to
     compile a current list of participating systems.

     Try it. You'll like it. If you'd like to take a look at the
     Echo, you can call MetroFire at 305-596-8611 or FireNet Leader
     at 719-591-7415 or St. Joe's Hospital at 602-235-9653 or
     SoundingBoard at 412-681-9464 for starters.

     If you have any questions or comments, you may send them to me
     via Netmail to 135/14. I'll be happy to assist you in
     convincing YOUR department to set up a system and get into the
     FireNet Echo. For a complete ARC of all my previous FireNet
     articles and other FireNet material, you may GET via SEAdog or
     other Bark request type program the file FIRENET.ARC or just
     FIRENET. If you are unable to GET it, I will send it upon
     receipt of a Netmail request.

     FireNet. It's here. It works and it's growing.

                   Southern Bell Declares a New Area Code
                          Central/Eastern Florida

     Effective at midnight, 16 Apr 88, Florida will have a new area
     code. The new prefix will be 407 and will be replacing a large
     portion of what is now area code 305.

     The area of change will encompass the east coast from Palm
     Beach county north to Brevard and west to Orlando and south to
     Disney World/Kissimmee.

     Some of the cities affected will be:

        Apopka, Belle Glade, Boca Raton, Boynton Beach, Cocoa, Cocoa
        Beach, Debary, Delray, Delray Beach, East Orange, Eau Gallie,
        Fort Pierce, Geneva, Hobe Sound, Hutchinson Island, Indian-
        town, Jensen Beach, Jupiter, Kenansville, Kissimmee, Lake
        Buena Vista, Lake Mary, Melbourne, Monteverde, Orlando,
        Oviedo, Pahokee, Port St. Lucie, Reedy Creek, Sanford,
        Satellite Beach, Sebastian, St. Cloud, Stuart, Titusville,
        Vero Beach, West Palm Beach, Windermere, Winter Garden and
        Winter Park.

     There will be a transition period from 16 Apr 88 through 18 Jun
     88 to allow everyone to get used to the change and implement it.
     Net Coordinators in the affected areas of Florida should make
     sure that these changes are reflected in the Nodelist submissions
     as soon a practicable so the rest of FidoNet doesn't end up with
     voice connections from the Southern Bell recording that goes into
     place at midnight on 19 Jun 88. Both 305 and 407 will operate
     normally during the transition period. Don't forget to change all
     references to your area codes in your Origin lines, bulletins and
     questionnaires when the time comes.

     Those of you outside of Florida with manual overrides in your
     Nodelist compiler control files will want to make adjustments as
     necessary for any Florida Nodes you may be carrying that are
     affected by this change.

     Thanks.

                     Introducing the Good Egg Network

     By now, I suspect that there are very few in FidoNet that have
     NOT heard about "The Good Egg Net".  Many think it's a joke,
     since it is scheduled to go into operation on April 1st.  Some
     think it's an idea from Hell, designed to destroy the FidoNet
     and all who use it.  Some folks think that it is a simply grand
     idea, and have given it alot of support.

     What is the truth here?  Just what IS the "Good Egg Net", and
     who is behind it?  And why?

     To answer these questions, you must have a pretty basic under-
     standing of the FidoNet, EchoMail, IFNA, and what has been going
     on in the various conferences lately.  I will attempt in this
     article to give a little background, and provide the information
     that so many have been asking for.

     First of all, Good Egg Net (EGGNET) is NOT a joke, despite the
     fact that it begins it's operation on April Fool's Day.  This is
     just pure coincidence.  John Zimmatore (133/107) and I were just
     brainstorming at the end of February, and decided to start up an
     alternative network based on how FidoNet USED to be (pre-IFNA).
     We realized that we had two choices:  simply announce AND begin
     operations (and be swamped and over our heads), or announce for
     a future date (one month later), and use that month to prepare.
     We chose the latter.

     Why are John and I doing this?  Well, this has been the subject
     of ALOT of "flaming".  Very basically, we no longer believe in
     IFNA.  We think IFNA has had time enough to get it's act
     together, and it has not done so.  IFNA has made promises and
     has not kept them.  IFNA, by controlling the NODELIST, controls
     the Sysops in the FidoNet.  A good percentage of the members of
     the IFNA BoD are not elected, but appointed (this because the
     elected people got fed up and quit).  A full disclosure of the
     IFNA finances was promised; we got a small listing of very
     gross numbers that are meaningless.  But I think perhaps the ONE
     thing that it did it for ME, anyway, was the attitude of the
     IFNA Board of Directors that you have only three choices in the
     FidoNet:  Lead, Follow, or get the Hell out of the way.  This
     very statement is on the origin line of all EchoMail that the
     IFNA *president* puts out in EchoMail.  This attitude, quite
     frankly, stinks.  Since the early days when IFNA was formed,
     folks disagreed with the premise of IFNA.  These folks, myself
     included, were told that if we didn't like what was going on,
     then we should go out and form a NEW network.  We are doing so
     here.  Now we are being flamed for doing so.  Well, you can't
     please everyone it seems.

     Clearly, IFNA has stumbled and there are quite a few Sysops out
     there like me, like John Zimmatore, and like over two dozen
     others that believe that we need an alternative.
     FidoNews 5-13                Page 11                  28 Mar 1988


     EGGNET is that alternative.  What we propose to do with EGGNEt
     is to recreate the way that FidoNet USED to be.  We intend to
     have a nodelist that is published bimonthly.  This nodelist will
     be PUBLIC DOMAIN.  We further propose to have a newsletter that
     will be made available to everyone that wants it, but we will
     NOT make it a requirement that each coordinator down the chain
     carry it.  It will be available from one central node, and will
     be available for file request.  If a net host in EGGNET wants to
     make it available down the chain, then so much the better.  But
     if a certain person in EGGNET decides that he or she does not
     want to carry the newsletter, there will be NO threats, NO ill
     will, and NO warnings from "Powers That Be".

     How will EGGNET be organized?  Simply.  We will have a system
     based on democracy, at least as close as we can come to it.  We
     will have three "Egg Commissioners" at the top who have as their
     responsibility the creation of the NODELIST and the NEWSLETTER,
     and that is ALL.  Nothing else.  After the first 6 months, Egg
     Commissioners will be elected by the REGIONAL COORDINATORS.
     Also after the first 6 months, the Regional Coordinators will be
     elected by the Network Coordinators.  And of course, the Network
     Coordinators will be elected by the sysops that make up their
     networks.  If you have ever read Randy Edward's "Sysop Bill of
     Rights", you get the general idea of what it is that we are
     trying to do here with the "Power".  We are trying to put it at
     the BASE of the network where it belongs, rather than at the TOP.

     How do conflicts get resolved in the EGGNET?  Again, simple.  We
     will have a Supreme Court.  No one that is a Network Coordinator
     or Regional Coordinator will be permitted to serve in this court
     while they also serve as coordinators.  And of course, none of
     the Egg Commissioners may serve.  Members of the court serve for
     a period of one year.  All issues brought before the court must
     be submitted formally and have a preponderance of evidence to
     support the case brought forward.  Anyone may bring forward a
     complaint, but if it is judged that the complaint is trivial and
     is made simply for the sake of attention, then the court will
     recommend that the offender be suspended from EGGNET for a
     period of time that can range from 2 weeks to one year.  Each
     Region has a representative sitting on the bench, and each rep
     is elected by the Network Coordinators from a list drawn up by
     the Egg Commissioners.  The Egg Commissioners make this list up
     based on nominations submitted by anyone in the EGGNET.  The Egg
     Commissioners themselves have no vote in the selection of the
     members of the bench.  The decision of the Court CAN be appealed
     if an ONLY if at least 1/3 of the EGGNET petitions the court for
     a retrial.

     What is EGGNET all about?  Well, that is real simple.  We're
     in this for FUN!  Remember that?  Remember a time when running a
     node was fun, and you didn't have to worry about IFNA or the
     various cheerleading going on?  Remember when FLAMES were some-
     thing that happened in your fireplace?  Remember a time before
     Nomex suits were standard equipment in EchoMail?  By trying to
     move the POWER out of the way, we hope to make everyone in the
     EGGNET peers such that there are no real Power Brokers.  It only
     FidoNews 5-13                Page 12                  28 Mar 1988


     follows that if we can isolate and control the situations where
     power can be taken and abused, then what we are left with is a
     nice, friendly place to communicate and to enjoy our hobby.  And
     we end up with a SIMPLISTIC network where intrigue and innuendo
     just don't happen.

     What about the EGGNET nodelist?  How will it be structured?
     Well, it will be structured EXACTLY the same as the IFNA node-
     list is today, so all the various nodelist processors and
     software utilities will still work.  The nodelist will be pub-
     lished twice a month:  once on the 15th, and again on the 30th.
     We will use Zone 99.  Our Regions will lay out EXACTLY the same
     as the FidoNet Regions, and will be numbered 910 through 920.
     All Networks in EGGNET will be numbered 9000 through 9999.  As
     far as we are aware, this should not interfere with anything
     that currently exists in FidoNet.

     One other thing:  EGGNET is NOT an "international" system.  We
     are doing this for North America only.  This is not because we
     don't care about the rest of the world.  We do!  But trying to
     MANAGE something THAT big would become a nightmare, and we do
     not want to get bogged down in administrivia.  That is alot of
     what is wrong in FidoNet these days (our opinion).  We would,
     of course, suggest that each area of the world consider well
     their own special circumstances, and if IFNA does it for you,
     then by all means stay there and enjoy.  If you have problems
     with IFNA, then you can always do what we in the States are in
     the process of doing, and create your very OWN verison of the
     EGGNET.  Different strokes for different folks, and diversity
     there is beauty.

     Listen folks, EGGNET is not here to try and "destroy Fidonet".
     We do hope to coexist PEACEFULLY with it.  Lots of folks that
     will be coming to EGGNET will maintain dual identities so that
     they will ALSO be a part of FidoNet.  While we do not encourage
     nodes in EGGNET to have dual or even triple identities, we will
     certainly no prohibit it either.  We have decided to use ZONE 99
     so that few if any in FidoNet will become upset over it.  Our
     nodelist will be Public Domain, and if folks in FidoNet want to
     compile it in along with their regular nodelist, then super!  We
     won't complain at all.  No one will have to pay a cent to be in
     the EGGNET.  No yearly dues.  We will interface with the IFNA
     controlled Fidonet only through EchoMail (it is our view that
     Echomail belongs to EVERYONE, and not just FidoNet).  Other than
     that, we just don't see a whole lot of reason for folks that
     stay in IFNA/FidoNet to complain.

     Currently, we are scheduled to begin normal operations in EGGNET
     on April 1st.  John Zimmatore will be taking care of the EGGNET
     nodelist and nodediff, so if you are interested in becoming a
     node in the EGGNET, send a message to John at 133/107 (via 133/0
     after 4/1/88, as Steve Antonoff will be gating netmail into
     EGGNET after that time).  I will be continuing to develop the
     basic policies and procedures for EGGNET.  We are still looking
     for a third Egg Commissioner to handle miscellaneous chores for
     EGGNET, so if you are interested or know anyone else that would

     like to volunteer, please let us know!

     Finally, the one point to remember about EGGNET is that we are
     made up of volunteers.  No one gets paid, no one gets their
     phone bills paid for them, and there is no glory or power OTHER
     THAN the feeling of friendship and accomplishment.  This is how
     it originally was with Fidonet, and that is what we are going
     back to.  If this flies, then great.  Perhaps other networks
     will learn from us.  If EGGNET flops, then so be it.  At least,
     we will have tried.

                     MegaList - Seven Months Later
                            (an update)
                            Chris Irwin
                     D'Bridge Support, 1:135/68
                         (1200-9600/HST)


          BACKGROUND

          Well, it's been seven months since I first wrote an article
     announcing the MegaList and I figured that it was about time to
     write a follow-up.  For those of you that don't know about the
     MegaList, it's a national cross-system file listing and (if I may
     say so myself) it's doing rather well!  As of this moment, there
     are over 28,000 files listed on 58 systems.  (1.2 gigobytes!)

          When I first started, I envisioned the MegaList as a text
     file sorted by filename listing all the files on participating
     systems.  This file still exists today, but it is over 400 pages
     long and unARCs to over a megabyte; it's grown to a point where
     it's a bit unreasonable to file-request or download unless you
     have a high-speed modem.  So in early August, I wrote a database
     inquiry program called ML-FIND; this allowed users to inquire
     directly using wildcard searches identical to a DOS directory
     listing.  This was setup as the "O" command in the file section
     of my board; instantly, you can locate any file on any system.


          CURRENT STATUS

        Part of the reason for writing this article was to announce a
     revolutionary new service offered by 1:135/68; this is the Mega-
     List inquiry service.  Because of the awesome new capabilities of
     D'Bridge, it is now possible for all WaZOO-based mailers to issue
     "Function Requests" to D'Bridge.  I won't go into exactly how it
     works here, but I'd like to explain how you can use it.  If you
     wish to inquire into the MegaList via netmail, here's what to do:

         1) Make sure that you are using a WaZOO/ZMODEM-based mailer
            such as D'Bridge, FrontDoor, Opus or BinkleyTerm.

         2) Create a text file called MEGALIST.INQ; this file should
            contain the filenames (including wildcards) that you wish
            to search for.  (one per line)

         3) Send the file to 1:135/68 and make sure that you have the
            "pickup" option enabled.

         4) When my system receives MEGALIST.INQ, it spawns the Mega-
            List Search program.  This program prepares MEGALIST.OUT
            which contains the results of your search.  This program
            has an internal timer so that no search may take over 30
            seconds.

         5) By ZMODEM "pickup" mail, D'Bridge will send you the output
            file, MEGALIST.OUT.  This file is a subset of the current
     FidoNews 5-13                Page 15                  28 Mar 1988


            MEGALIST.TXT file containing just the files that you were
            looking for or an error message if the file doesn't exist
            or your MEGALIST.INQ format was invalid.


          Simple, right?  I am aware that some other NETs (both here
     and abroad) are creating their own MegaLists for their area.  If
     any of you are running D'Bridge or FrontDoor and would like to
     provide this service also, please contact me for the software; it
     is not available as a general release as of this time.


          To summarize, the MegaList is available from 1:135/68 in the
     following forms:

          - By download, WaZOO or Bark request with the filenames:

            MEGALIST.ARC - A rather "huge" file containing the text
                           file MEGALIST.TXT; ALL files on ALL systems.

            MEGA-ARC.ARC - Another "huge" file with MEGA-ARC.TXT;
                           .ARC files on ALL systems.

            MEGA-TXT.ARC - A small subset of .TXT, .DOC and files with
                           no extension.

            ML-INDEX.ARC - The current database files for ML-FIND.
                           This file is somewhere around 400K and can
                           only be used with ML-FIND or ML-SEARCH.

          - By online inquiry through my Opus system using ML-FIND,
            the "Outside" command in the file-section.

          - Or by the WaZOO-based inquiry described above


          JOIN THE MEGALIST

          All BBS systems in North America are invited to join the
     National MegaList;  All that is required is that your system be
     100% IBM compatable and your BBS has Fido/Opus-compatable SYSTEM
     and FILES.BBS files.  Get the ML-UPD program from 1:135/68 and
     run it about once per month; systems must supply updates at least
     once every 90 days to remain in the list.

          ML-UPD takes just a few minutes to run and is completely
     automatic.  It creates an update file, ARCs it, then mails it
     to the National MegaList center in Miami, Florida.  The following
     software relating to the MegaList is available for download or
     WaZOO/Bark file-request from 1:135/68:

          ML-UPD.ARC  -  MegaList update software; used to  add your
                         system to the national (or a local) list.

          ML-COL.ARC  -  Create MegaLists for your NET or REGION with
                         this program; this also can create database
     FidoNews 5-13                Page 16                  28 Mar 1988


                         files for ML-FIND.

          ML-FIND.ARC -  An "Outside" command designed to be used with
                         Opus that allows fast database inquiry into
                         the megalist.  Requires ML-COL or ML-INDEX
                         to operate.


          THE FUTURE

          Well, I meant to release a "version 2" late last year, but
     my six-month project of writing D'Bridge kinda kept me more than
     busy.  Now that D'Bridge is ready for preliminary release in the
     middle of March, I am ready to dedicate some time to making some
     revsions to the way MegaList works.  It has been suggested that
     the best way to organize the list would be to break down the
     collection process using Regional MegaList Coordinators.  These
     coordinators would maintain a list for their region plus submit
     the data to the national collection center on a monthly basis.

          I agree with this approach, but I think that we should go
     a step further and organize the lists by catagory/machine type.
     As of this time, I haven't written one line of code towards the
     "version 2" because I'm at a loss for exactly what to do.  I'm
     at a point where I really need some feedback from the users and
     potential users of the MegaList.  If you feel (as I do) that this
     project warrants continuing effort and organization, then your
     input and/or help would be greatly appreciated.  Help along the
     following lines is requested:

          - Regional MegaList Coordinators needed; the IFNA nodelist
            is broken down into logical regions.  If we could get one
            person from each region willing to act as a collection
            center, we could make the concept work much better.  As
            I said earlier, the national list (in text format) is a
            little bit unreasonable in size; database inquiry is the
            only logical way for inquiry into this ever-growning list.

          - Software authors for non-IBM machines; from the beginning,
            people have complained about ML-UPD not working on non-
            compatables.  I must admit, that I did this on purpose to
            keep non-IBM software out of the list.  If we can come up
            with a way to put a "tag" on each file-area defining the
            machine and software catagory, we could segment the list
            in a very logical way...

          - General constructive criticism; sometimes being the author
            of a widely-used package causes one to be a bit "myopic"
            in one's views.  I admit that this is the case here.  It
            would really help if I got some feedback about this and
            some suggestions about how I can make the MegaList work
            more effectively.  Over the last few months, interest has
            slacked off a bit in the national list.  There are many
            local/regional lists, but people seem less interested in
            the national list.  Right now, the MegaList is actually
            shrinking rather than growing; at one point, 70 systems

            were listed!

          Anyway, I can't believe that I could type so much; I didn't
     think that I had so much to say.  Thanks for listening/reading

     David Garrett, 1:103/501
     Nominations and Elections Chairman


     The time has come for all those who desire to run for the postion
     of Director for their Division (Region) to place their  names  on
     the ballot.


     The  following Divisions have their BoD Representatives Positions
     up for re-election:

         Division 10
         Division 12
         Division 14
         Division 16
         Division 18
         Zone 2

         At-Large 5 Members

     In order to qualify to run for the position,  it is necessary for
     to  be a dues paying member of IFNA,  if running for a Divisional
     position, to be a member of that Division (Region),  and have the
     support of 10 members of IFNA from your Region.  The procedure is
     as follows:

           1.  Send  a  Net  Mail  Message  direct  from  your node to
               103/501 stating that you intend to run for the position
               on the BoD (please state as to whether it  is  Regional
               or At-Large).

           2.  Have ten IFNA members submit their statement of support
               for  your  running  to  103/501 by Direct NetMail.  The
               subject line of the message should contain  your  name.
               If  you  are running for a Divisional position then you
               must have 10 Members  from  your  Region  support  you,
               otherwise   you   can  obtain  any  10  Members  names,
               duplicates are allowed.

     That's all that there is to it.  Your  Net  Mail  Message  should
     reach me no later than May 21,  1988, names will be listed on the
     Ballot in alpha sequence by Region.  At-Large directors  will  be
     listed in name sequence only.

     Ballots  will  be send to FidoNews for Publication by May 28th in
     order to meet the needs of the By-Laws.

     Remember that this is your organization and we need your  support
     to make it match the needs of our membership.

                        A New Net in Massachusetts
                       by David Kaufman (1:321/147)

     Starting with NODELIST.078 (barring some unforeseen occurence) a
     new net, Net 322, will form in Massachusetts.  The new net will
     be comprised of nodes from both of the existing nets (Net 321 and
     Net 101).  If you do echomail or have regular correspondence with
     any Massachusetts node, make sure you know which net that node
     will be in.  Here's a list of those which will be moving:

     Setting up NetMail with QuickBBS
     By Gene Coppola 1/114 (107/246)

     By now you have downloaded a copy of Quick BBS and have
     decided that it is the BEST Shareware Bulletin Board system
     and have decided you would like to join the network.

     Okay, great. The first thing you should do is get a copy of
     POLICY3.DOC and read it thoroughly from start to finish.
     This file explains all you need to know to get a Net/Node
     number and join the network. (Okay I was obligated to tell
     you that first, now let's continue.)

     The world is divided into seperate Zones in the network.
     Each Zone is then divided into multiple Regions. Each Region
     is further divided into Nets. Each Net has a Coordinator and
     in most cases several Hubs that service the individual
     Sysops in each Net.

     Each Sysop who joins the Net receives a unique Net/Node
     identification number to identify his system. The
     Coordinator's Net/Node number is easy to find in the
     Nodelist as it ends in a zero. For example a Sysop in the
     Net 107 area who would like to request a Net/Node number
     would send a message to 107/0 who would start the processing
     on it's way.

     Current policy REQUIRES that all requests for Net/Node
     number assignments be sent via NETMAIL to the appropriate
     person. This might sound strange, but in fact is based on
     sound reasoning. If you have set up your system properly,
     then the message will get through, and in most cases this
     also means that you will be able to receive NETMAIL as well
     as send it. If your system is not set up properly then the
     message will not be sent, and you will have to do further
     work to get your system set up properly.

     No matter what system you are running ie; Quick BBS, TBBS,
     RBBS, Fido or Opus, you NEED to get a copy of the Nodelist
     if you wish to join the public network. The Nodelist is
     updated once a week as is available on most systems. The
     first time, you will need to get the complete Nodelist. Each
     weeks list is numbered with a Julian day as the last 3
     digits of the file name. For example the Nodelist for March
     18, 1988 should be named NODELIST.078 or in the archived
     form it would be called NODELIST.A78. The last 3 digits
     increase as the year goes on. Once you get the first copy
     you can update it each week by obtaining that weeks NODEDIFF
     which contains the weekly updates.

     The NODEDIFF files are also numbered the same way so the
     NODEDIFF for the above date would be NODEDIFF.A78. Way back
     when I first started, we updated the Nodelist by hand,
     adding and deleting nodes manually. However this soon got to
     be too much work, and utilities were written to automate
     this task for you.
     FidoNews 5-13                Page 22                  28 Mar 1988


     The BEST utility to use for this is known as XLATLIST and is
     usually available on systems under the following names of
     XLATRGEN.ARC or XLATLIST.ARC. The current version of this
     utility is 2.86 as of the date of this article. XLATLIST was
     written and designed to make the weekly updates as painless
     as possible. Once set up, XLATLIST will take last weeks
     Nodelist, process the current Nodediff and produce a new,
     updated Nodelist for you. This utility was written by Thom
     Henderson of System Enhancement Associates, and we all owe
     Thom thanks for this fine utility.

     Other people have written utilities but none perform up to
     the high standards of XLATLIST. XLATLIST was freely given to
     Sysops to use, while other utilities require payment for
     continued use, and in certain instances have even been know
     to send Netmail messages to their authors, notifying them
     that you are using their software. XLATLIST is great, and
     the author is a concerned Sysop, who deals with problems as
     they occur and provide updates as needed.

     An important note is needed here. In order for XLATLIST to
     properly work, you MUST run it EACH and EVERY week without
     fail. This will assure you that your list is up to date and
     you will not be accidently calling a "little old lady" in
     the middle of the night, trying to send Netmail.

     Okay, once you XLATLIST, you set up the control file for it,
     with the appropriate information. In the case of a new Sysop
     requesting a node number, use a -1 as your node number. For
     example, after reading the nodelist and determining you are
     in the Net 107 area, you would put 107/-1 as your node
     number UNTIL you receive your permanent number. This special
     number (-1) notifies the Coordinator this a request for a
     node number.

     PLEASE, do not make up a node number. This is the "accepted"
     way of requesting a node number. Making up a node number
     will just confuse the entire process and result in a delay
     for you to receive your number.



     Now copy the file that XLATLIST produces (nodelist.bbs) to
     your Quick BBS directory. Run Qconfig and set up the basic
     parameters, including a message board for Netmail (there can
     be only ONE such board in Quick BBS) and the basic
     information requested.

     Now run Qnode which will process the information contained
     in nodelist.bbs and produce a file that Quick BBS uses to
     know where to send Netmail.

     Now send a message to the Coordinator in the area that you
     are in requesting a Net/Node number. Please be sure to
     include the following information as a minimum.

     FidoNews 5-13                Page 23                  28 Mar 1988


     1) Sysops Name
     2) Bulletin Board Name
     3) Phone Number
     4) Full Address Of The System.
     5) Maximum Baud Rate
     6) Hours System Operates.
     7) Name Of Front End Software
     8) Protocols In Use.

     This is the MINIMUM information required. If the Coordinator
     requires more information, you will be notified of this.

     Quick BBS requires some type of external software to handle
     the Netmail functions. The following software (in no special
     order) works quite well with Quick BBS. Binkley, SEAdog,
     Dbridge, Front Door, and Dutchie. I prefer Binkley which is
     widely available and works quite well.

     Once Quick BBS and your Front End are set up, it is time to
     send the message to your Coordinator. Remember that the
     Coordinator's number will end in a zero (107/0). Hopefully
     the Coordinator will send back information pertaining to any
     special routing your Net uses to process Netmail.

     At this point in time you must make your system available to
     process mail during National Mail Hour (NMH). NMH has been
     carefully established to allow mail to flow between systems
     when the costs are the lowest. On the East Coast (EST) NMH
     is currently between 4 and 5 a.m. Your Coordinator can help
     you translate this into the proper time frame for your
     location.

     So to recap, the following files are the minimum required to
     set up for Network mail.

     1) Current Nodelist File.
     2) XLATLIST or XLATRGEN File.
     3) One Of The Various Front End Mail Programs.

     If you cannot find these anywhere else, they are available
     from 1/114 at (516)-328-7064. We are open from 6:15 a.m.
     until 2:45 a.m. for bulletin board access. All files above
     and all the Quick BBS software and utilities are available

     Board program, which takes a back-seat to no other software.

                      Yet Another Complicated Komment

                            by Steven K. Hoskin
                        ( STEVE HOSKIN at 1:128/31 )

                       Episode 4:  Electronic Voting



          I don't know about  y'all  out  there,  but  I want to see a
     democratic FidoNet.  You know,  where each FidoNode gets one vote
     on matters that concern the InterNational FidoNet.

          I thought originally that was  why the InterNational FidoNet
     Association went corporate;  so  there'd be rules to follow about
     collective voting.

          As it turned out, for  whatever  reasons,  IFNA did not turn
     out to be that voting tool, that  graceful central coordinator of
     the collective will of all  FidoNet  SysOps.  One of its problems
     is that members of FidoNet are  NOT  necessarily members of IFNA.
     Therefore, IFNA cannot do things  to  control FidoNet, as FidoNet
     SysOps don't get to vote on IFNA matters if they're not IFNA.

          To join IFNA costs $25.    You  should  NEVER have to pay to
     vote on  something  that  affects  the  way  you  run  your life.
     Period.

          I joined IFNA because I thought  it would help to insure the
     survival of FidoNet during hard times.  That may still hold true,
     and I will probably be an IFNA member for life, but one thing has
     become clear to me:  IFNA IS NOT ESTABLISHING NET-WIDE DEMOCRACY.

          Don Daniels, president of IFNA, has requested ideas for ways
     to establish a fully democratic  FidoNet,  BE IT VIA IFNA OR SOME
     OTHER MECHANISM.  Now there's a man who's interested in FidoNet.

          Well, here we go again, folks, YET ANOTHER idea:  Electronic
     Voting.

          Reserve a FidoNode, just  like  1:1/0 does the NodeList, and
     1:1/1 does the FidoNews,  to  handle  strictly Electronic Voting.
     For sake of example, I'll use  1:1/9.   I don't know if this Node
     number is being used for anything, but that's my example.

          For starters, if IFNA is to be retained (as many of us would
     STILL like to see), we must adopt  a  by-law (if nothing stronger
     can be used) that states in whatever legal wording is needed that
     IFNA as an organization MUST ABIDE BY FIDONET SYSOP VOTE RESULTS.
     And that IFNA MUST  ISSUE  BALLOTS  FOR  VOTE  ON  ANY RESOLUTION
     REQUESTED BY ANY FIDONET SYSOP.
     FidoNews 5-13                Page 27                  28 Mar 1988


          Then get 1/9 going.  An automated  system, disallowing human
     tampering, whereby ballots and  resolutions are sent to the node,
     1/9 sends the ballot via Network  mail AUTOMATICALLY to ALL Nodes
     in the NodeList DIRECTLY, and waits for some predetermined amount
     of time for a vote result.

          If one month is  the  predetermined  time,  have 1/9 re-send
     ballots to any Node from  which  no  vote  has been received on a
     weekly basis until either a  vote  is  received or the time limit
     has been reached.

          As vote "ballot" messages come back to 1/9 via Network Mail,
     in   some   predetermined   format   such   that   a   relatively
     unsophisticated program can  determine  the vote, 1/9 tallies the
     vote, stores the message,  and  sends  a verification message via
     Network Mail DIRECTLY to the node that allegedly sent the ballot.

          Duplicate Node  votes  would  be  cancelled  and  the ballot
     reissued to the Node in  question  with  a note commenting on the
     duplication.

          A password  could  be  set  up  for  each  Node  and  placed
     somewhere  in  the  Ballot  return   vote  message.    Improperly
     passworded ballots would cause  1/9 to send a message DIRECTLY to
     that Node informing  him  or  her  that  a  password  failing had
     occurred.  A place for changing  of passwords could also be added
     to the ballot return message.

          This should eliminate "bogus"  node  voting, as the SysOp of
     the REAL Node could  then  be  aware  that  somebody is trying to
     break into his or her vote.

          When all Nodes have responded  OR the time limit is reached,
     1/9 forwards the vote  results  to  anybody that wants it, either
     via Network Mail or as an Echo Area.

          Have a preformed  message  format  for  requesting a ballot,
     which could be sent to  1/9  such  that  no human could interfere
     with the request for the vote.  This eliminates interference with
     the   vote   request   system  if  someone   feels   that   their
     ballot/resolution  has  not  been  properly  sent to 1/9 by IFNA.
     Improper resolutions  thusly  sent  could  be  construed as being
     "excessively annoying"  and  multiple  occurrences  of such could
     then be voted on by the Network  for  possible EXCOMMUNICATION of
     the offending Node.

          Choosing who runs Node  1/9  is  a  sensitive subject, since
     that person  could  theoretically  tamper  with  things.  There's
     simply going to have to be SOME kind of trust out there.

          This is not a full overview,  as  I  am  trying to limit the
     size of this column.  Replies, questions, comments, etc.  contact
     me as STEVE HOSKIN at Node 1:128/31.   I'd love to see this thing
     implemented.  I'd even write the software.  :-)
