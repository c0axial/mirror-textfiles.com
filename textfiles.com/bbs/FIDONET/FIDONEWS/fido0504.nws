     =================================================================

          Well, I  think I've  finally got  things worked  out here at
     FidoNews. There were a few problems  at first,  but I  think I've
     finally got everything worked out. Hopefully everything will work
     again this week and I  can  count  on  everything  working  as it
     should.

          Some of you may have a received a miniature copy of FidoNews
     two weeks ago. I'd like  to  apologize  for  this,  but  for some
     reason  the  software  that  puts  FidoNews  together  won't  run
     properly off of a file server. I caught  the error  at about 2:00
     am,  unfortunately  some  people  had  already  gotten  a copy. I
     quickly fixed the problem with the one being sent out, but missed
     a FNEWS502.ARC.  A few  more picked  up the  bad file and while I
     tried to send out a corrected  version to  everyone but  may have
     missed someone in all the confusion.

          I'd  like  to  thank  all  of  you who have sent me mail and
     submissions. You've all helped make FidoNews what it is, and have
     helped keep  the net  together at the same time. What are some of
     the articles you can look forward  to in  the near  future? Well,
     starting off  this week  there is the first of a proposed POLICY4
     document for FidoNet (not IFNA). These should be running over the
     next few  weeks. In  addition to the proposed documents, I'd like
     to see some discussion on them. If FidoNet  appears to  come to a
     consensus on a POLICY4.DOC, it will end up affecting everyone. So
     make sure you speak up now.

          We also have some articles on some of the new software being
     used in  FidoNet. Programs like BinkleyTerm and the new Opus. I'd
     also like to see  some articles  on Fido  version 12  and Dutchie
     while we're at it. I'm also still waiting for some new columns in
     FidoNews. It still  seems  a  little  empty  knowing  I  won't be
     writing my  old column  for some  time and  I'd like to fill that
     spot in the near future.

          Oh well...It's approaching print  time and  I've got  to get
     this over  to the  other machine  here. Next time around I should
     actually have something to  say about  some of  the recent events
     in FidoNet. Until then, read and enjoy!

                         The Bill of Rights
                              Follow Up



        Since I put out the FidoNet Sysop's Bill of Rights I've heard
     many comments and suggestions about it.  I'd like to share a few
     thoughts about the idea.

        Some have thought that this proposal in some way 'threatens'
     IFNA.  I couldn't disagree more.  I see it as complimenting IFNA
     and in fact making IFNA more 'legit'.  By this I mean with the
     Bill of Rights or something similar in place, we'll have a
     democratic, free for all FidoNet with elected coordinators
     managing the day to day operations.  What could compliment IFNA
     more?

        Some have mentioned that the Coordinator elections will
     become a big political circus.  I don't think so.  You'll notice
     the election 'season' is limited to 30 days and for 90% of the
     elections there will be 50 or less votes to count.  This should
     be fast and easy to manage and verify.  I think most nodes in
     the Network are quite happy with their coordinators (I am) and I
     don't foresee any massive changes or radical swings.  Even if
     that were to happen it'd be the _will_ of the net.  I don't
     believe we'll have a lot of problems with new coordinators.

        A new coordinator can't have less than a year in the FidoNet,
     so we won't have a chance of a raw rookie as Zone Coordinator.
     And with an orderly system of replacement we'll have less
     'burnout' and we'll bring fresh blood into the system.

        The FidoNet is getting too large and powerful to have it keep
     running the way it was when it had 50 nodes.  It's time for real
     netwide democracy.

        A few things to consider ...

        Do we have a consistent netwide policy of replacing
     coordinators and preventing 'burnout'?   No.

        Do we have a consistent policy of having assistant or
     temporary coordinators in case of unexpected events?   No.

        Does each node in the network have a fair and equal voice in
     FidoNews 5-04                Page 3                   25 Jan 1988


     how it is being governed?   No.

        Does each node have protection from software discrimination
     and unfair dues, taxes, or fees?   No.

        Does each node have protection from others deleting echomail
     or automatically copying all of their incoming netmail?   No.

        Here's one attempt at solving those and a few other problems.



           [*]  THE FIDONET SYSOP'S BILL OF RIGHTS  [*]

                         version  0.10


     [1]  Any new POLICYx document must be ratified by the
     same process as an amendment or deletion to this document.
     (see #10 below)

     [2]  (a) No node may delete or modify (except modification by
     recognized netmail utilities) intransit netmail unless it
     is obviously illegal in nature.  Copying or recording of
     intransit messages is forbidden.  An exception to this right
     is prior agreement between all parties.

          (b) No node may delete or modify (except modification by
     recognized net/echomail utilities) intransit echomail unless
     it is obviously illegal in nature.  An exception to this
     rule is an agreed-upon conference moderator.  All nodes must
     do any local modification or deletion ('chopping' or 'ed-
     meeseing') of echomail after it is scanned.

     [3]  (a) Every node has the right to choose to be listed in
     either  the local geographic network, or as an independent
     node in the local geographic region.

          (b) No independent regional node will be subject to any
     mandatory dues, taxes, or fees of any kind.

          (c) Every node has the right to run any FTSC approved
     software and no network will restrict software types.

     [4]  Every network will have an Election every 12 months.
     The election will be held in June (see {2} below), in honor
     of the month the original FidoNet converted nodelists.  Every
     node in the network will have one vote towards the position of
     Network Coordinator.  Elections are won by straight majority,
     but elections that are not won by more than 5% are submitted to
     an automatic revote within 30 days.  This is to ensure the
     winner of an election has enough support to work effectively
     and to help prevent controversial election results.

          The Network Coordinator, upon election, will name an
     assistant.  The Assistant Coordinator (at each level (Net,
     FidoNews 5-04                Page 4                   25 Jan 1988


     Reg., Zone)) will act as Coordinator at any time the elected
     coordinator is unable to.  Additionally, if a Coordinator
     resigns, the Assistant will take over until the following
     election (or recalled by a recall vote, see below).  The newly
     elected Network Coordinator will serve until the following June
     when a new election will be held.  The Network Coordinator will
     act as a combination 'Prime Minister' and 'Representative' of
     the Net in addition to any other duties outlined in Policy4.

          Additionally, if there are 10 or more independant nodes in
     a Region, (termed a Group, see {1} below) they are also
     encouraged to have similar elections as above selecting one
     person to be thier Representative, though since independent
     regional nodes are independent, the Representative's position
     will be in an unofficial capacity (see below).

     [5]  If at any time during a Network Coordinators term of
     office, if 25% of the nodes in the network agree they can
     submit a Request for Recall to the Network and Regional
     Coordinators, who will have 2 weeks to verify the Request
     for Recall and respond to the plantiffs via netmail.  Within
     60 days of the Request for Recall a new election will be held
     (unless the June election is within 60 days).

     [6]  Every region will have an Election every 12 months.
     The election will be held in August (see {2} below), in honor
     of the month of the first FidoCon and the birth of IFNA and
     the start of democracy in the FidoNet.  Every Network
     Coordinator in the Region will vote towards the position
     of Regional Coordinator.  Additionally, if a Region has 10
     or more independant nodes in it and the nodes have elected
     a Representative (see above), then that Representative will
     vote in the Regional elections.

          Each Network Coordinator (and Group Rep) will cast votes
     toward the position of Regional Coordinator which total up to
     the total number of nodes that the Network Coordinator (Rep.)
     had in his Network (or Group) at the time he was elected.  But,
     if the total number of nodes in any one net or group in any
     particular region add up to 50% or more of the total nodes in
     that region then that net must be broken up into two (or more)
     nets to prevent unfair elections.

          The Regional Coordinator, upon election, will name an
     assistant and serve until the following August when a new
     election will be held.  The Regional Coordinator will act as
     a combination 'Prime Minister' and 'Representative' of the
     Region, in addition to any other duties outlined in Policy4.

     [7]  If at any time during a Regional Coordinators term of
     office, if 25% of the Network Coordinators (plus one vote
     for a qualified 10+ elected independant regional Group
     Representative) in the region agree they can submit a
     Request for Recall to the Regional and Zone Coordinators,
     who will have 2 weeks to verify the Request for Recall and
     respond to the plantiffs via netmail. Within 60 days of the
     FidoNews 5-04                Page 5                   25 Jan 1988


     Request for Recall a new election will be held (unless the
     August election is within 60 days).

     [8]  Every zone will have an Election every 12 months.  The
     election will be held in September (see {2} below), in honor
     of the month of the first St. Louis nodelist.  Every Regional
     Coordinator in the Zone will vote towards the position of Zone
     Coordinator.

          Each Regional Coordinator will cast votes toward the
     position of Zone Coordinator which total up to the total number
     of nodes that the Regional Coordinator had in his Region at the
     time he was elected.  If the total number of nodes in any one
     region in the zone add up to 50% or more of the total nodes in
     that zone then that region must be broken up into two (or more)
     regions.

          The Zone Coordinator, upon election, will name an assistant
     and serve until the following September when a new election will
     be held.  The Zone Coordinator will act as a combination 'Prime
     Minister' and 'Representative' of the Zone in addition to any
     other duties outlined in Policy4.

     [9]  If at any time during a Zone Coordinators term of office,
     if 25% of the Regional Coordinators (plus one vote for a
     qualified 10+ Group) in the zone agree they can submit a Request
     for Recall to the Zone and Int'l Coordinators, who will have 2
     weeks to verify the Request for Recall and respond to the
     plantiffs via netmail.  Within 60 days of the Request for Recall
     a new election will be held (unless the August election is
     within 60 days).

     [10]  An amendment or deletion to this Bill of Rights or
     ratification of a new Policy document is done by a Constitional
     Convention.  The exact procedure is this:

     If a node wishes an amendment or deletion (which should be
     thought out carefully, for it is a very serious matter) he must
     write up a Proposal for the amendment or deletion stating the
     reasons for a change.

     The proposal is sent to the proposing nodes Net Coordinator (or
     RC for a Regional Ind.) who must verify it by responding in no
     more than seven days to the proposing node via netmail. The
     Network Coordinator then will put the proposal on the Net ballot
     for next election (whether it be recall or the June election).
     If the proposal does not win by more than 5% then is is a failed
     proposal and no further action is taken on it. If the proposal
     wins by more than 5% then the proposal is submitted to each of
     the Regional Coordinators and to the Zone Coordinator.  Upon
     receipt the Regional Coordinators have 60 days to vote on the
     Proposal and notify the Zone Coordinator of their vote.  The
     Zone Coordinator will then tally the votes and notify the RC's
     and the Node who submitted the proposal of the RC's vote via
     netmail.  If the RC's vote 75% in favor For the amendment or
     deletion then the Proposal is submitted for a Zone
     FidoNews 5-04                Page 6                   25 Jan 1988


     Constitutional Vote.

          The Zone Constitutional Vote (ZCV) is done in June. Every
     Node in the Network votes on a ZCV.  The ZCV is done by placing
     the Proposal on each individual Network's (and qualified
     Regional Group) ballot for Network Coordinator. Each Network
     Coordinator will then tally his/her Network's ZCV vote and
     submit it to the Zone Coordinator who has 30 days to add up the
     total ZCV vote and report it to the RC's and NC's.

          The ZCV vote is won on a  straight majority count of votes -
     but for a change to this Bill of Rights to take place the
     Proposal must 'win' the vote by at least 5% - if the proposal
     wins, but does not win by 5% then the Proposal is considered too
     controversial and is held over for an automatic ZCV revote the
     following June.

     ---


     {1} GROUP  =  A Group consists of 10 or more independant nodes
     in any given regione.  Some independent regional nodes don't
     directly vote in elections, but most large Groups organize
     themselves into unofficial 'mini-nets' for voting reasons, and
     elect a semi-official spokesman for the Group called a
     Representative to cast their vote in regional elections.  Each
     Regional Group Representative election must take place
     in the same month and manner as other Regional elections.

     {2} ELECTIONS  =  A potential candidate for a Coordinator
     position must think long and hard before volunteering, the
     demands are many and the pay is nothing.  A candidate must have
     already been a node in the particular net/region/zone for at
     least one year before you can volunteer to run.  Before each
     election, candidates for the Coordinator position must volunteer
     six weeks before the actual election date to the current holder
     of the desired position. The current holder must verify the
     candidacy by replying via netmail to the candidate within 7
     days.  The ballot is then made up of prospective volunteers.  If
     there are no volunteers then the immediate superior coordinator
     is free to appoint any node to the position (who will be subject
     to recall), assume the position temporarily himself, repeat the
     election process at a specified date, or to disband the
     net/region in accordance with appropriate Policyx document.

        The ballot is then made up by the current coordinator of all
     the people volunteering for the position.  This ballot should be
     posted as widely as possible by the current coordinator,
     candidates, and all net members beginning on the first day of
     the election month.  This is the beginning of the election
     campaign.  On the twenty-seventh of the election month the
     current coordinator will start accepting the actual ballots from
     the appropriate voters.  The polls close at midnight on the last
     day of the voting month.  The current coordinator then has 7
     days to tally the votes and announce the results.  If the
     current coordinator is to be replaced, then this shall be done

     within 7 days.


              [*]  End of the FidoNet Bill of Rights  [*]


     ---


     Standard version numbers are in effect:
           1.23
     1 = Major change, 2 = Minor change, 3 = Tiny change


        Changes:


     Version 0.10

     *    Added Policyx verification by ZCV. (Why not?!)
     *    Defined/outlined the election process.
     *    Gave the NC's and RC's a "total vote" which is the total of
     the nodes at the time of the NC or RC's election.  Since the
     FidoNet is made up of volunteers with limited time we cannot run
     a 'two-house' democracy (it'd be big, slow and would further
     hurt the effectiveness of the "dictatorship" of the various
     coordinators).  So to directly represent the will of the nodes
     in the FidoNet we give the NC's and RC's voting power based on
     the total number of nodes under them. Simple, effective, and
     fair.
     *    Added rights for discrimenation of software, and for no
     dues or fees to be placed on regional independents.  Some
     networks might want to charge a fee, so it'll be up to them.
     The regional ind's will have the right never to be charged
     (since all nodes can be reg ind's).
     *    Changes to recall and amendment percentages.  Added net-
     vote for amendments to the Bill of Rights, stressed netmail
     verification, other minor spelling/wording changes ...

                               Chapter 1

                               OVERVIEW

     FidoNet is an amateur electronic mail system.  As such, all of
     its participants and operators are non-paid volunteers.  Some
     may be professionals in the computer field, but in the net, they
     are volunteers.  From its early beginnings as a few friends
     swapping messages back and forth, it has now grown to (Date
     later) over 1600 different systems on four continents.  It
     includes more than just Fido systems now.  We have OPUS, Seadog,
     TBBS, Dutchie, and there will be more to come.

     FidoNet is large enough that it would quickly fall apart of its
     own weight unless some sort of structure and control were
     imposed on it.  Multi net operation provides the structure.
     Decentralized management provides the control.  This document is
     an attempt to describe the procedures which have been developed
     to manage the network.

     1.1   Definitions

     FidoNet systems are grouped on several levels.  These are as
     follows:

     o  Point: A point is the smallest unit of the Fidonet.  One or
        more Points can be assembled under a node.  These points are
        visible only to the node over the point.

     o  Nodes: A node is a single FidoNet address, and is the
        smallest recognized, addressable unit of FidoNet.

     o  Networks: A network is a collection of nodes, usually in a
        relatively small geographic area.  Networks coordinate their
        mail activity to decrease cost and increase mail throughput.

     o  Regions: A region is a well defined geographic area
        containing nodes which may or may not be combined into
        networks.  A typical region will contain many nodes in
     FidoNews 5-04                Page 9                   25 Jan 1988


        networks, and a few independent nodes, which are not a part
        of any network.

     o  Zones: A zone is a large geographic area containing many
        regions, and covering one or more countries and/or
        continents.

     o  FidoNet: This indicates the entire public amateur mail
        network, as defined by the weekly node list.

     o  IFNA (International FidoNet Association): An association
        formed by a group of FidoNet Sysops.  It was formed as a
        means to formalize some functions, such as nodelist
        compilation, and to defray expenses incurred in promoting
        FidoNet.

     o  Nodelist; A weekly file that contains the addresses of all
        recognized nodes.  This file is compiled on Friday by IFNA
        and is made available in electronic form at no charge by
        IFNA.  It is not required to be a member of IFNA to be listed
        in the nodelist.

     o  TechNet: Another nodelist compilation association.  It,
        unlike IFNA, is not a paid membership association.

     1.2   The Levels of FidoNet

     With the introduction of multi net Fido in early 1985, FidoNet
     has developed a hierarchical structure, with the following
     levels:

     o  The International Technical Coordinator;  The International
        Technical Coordinator compiles all of the node lists from all
        of the regions and creates the master node list, which is
        then distributed over FidoNet.

     o  The Zone Coordinator: In some cases the International
        Technical Coordinator will appoint a Zone Coordinator to
        oversee FidoNet operations in a given zone.  The exact duties
        and responsibilities of any given Zone Coordinator are
        assigned by the International Technical Coordinator, and will
        not be discussed here.

     o  The Regional Coordinator: The Regional Coordinator maintains
        the list of independent nodes in his region and accepts node
        lists from the Network Coordinators in his region.  He
        compiles these lists to create a regional node list for his
        region, which he then sends to the International Technical
        Coordinator.  A Regional Coordinator does not perform routing
        services for any nodes in his region.

     o  The Network Coordinator: The Network Coordinator is
        responsible for maintaining the list of nodes for his
        network, and for receiving and forwarding any mail coming to
        the network from outside.

     FidoNews 5-04                Page 10                  25 Jan 1988


     o  The Network Routing Hub: Network Routing Hubs exist only in
        three tiered networks.  They generally share some or all of
        the duties of the Network Coordinator, in order to ease the
        management of a large network.  The exact duties and
        procedures are a matter for the Network Coordinator and his
        hubs to settle, and will not be discussed here.  The Network
        Coordinator is still responsible for the maintenance of the
        network.

     o  The system operator (sysop): The sysop formulates his own
        policy for running his board and dealing with his users, so
        that will not be discussed in this document.  However, the
        sysop must also mesh with the rest of the FidoNet system if
        he is to send and receive mail, and that will be discussed here.

     o  The user: Policy and procedures for the individual user on
        any given board is determined by the system operator of that
        board, and will not be considered in this document.

     These levels act to distribute the administration and control of
     FidoNet to the lowest possible level, while still allowing for
     coordinated action over the entire mail system.  Administration
     is made possible by operating in a strict top-down manner.  That
     is, a person at any given level is responsible to the level
     above him, and responsible for the level below him.

     For example, a Regional Coordinator is solely responsible to the
     International Technical Coordinator for anything that may or may
     not happen in his region.  From the point of view of the
     International Technical Coordinator, the Regional Coordinator is
     totally and completely responsible for the smooth operation of
     his region.  Likewise, from the point of view of the Regional
     Coordinator, the Network Coordinators are totally and completely
     responsible for the smooth operation of their networks.

     If a person at any level above sysop is unable for any reason to
     properly perform his duties, then he can be replaced by the
     person at the next level up.  For example, if a Regional
     Coordinator is failing to perform his duties, then the
     International Coordinator can cause him to be replaced.  In
     addition, if a majority of the lower level are dissatisfied with
     the performance of the next level, they may ask for a
     replacement.

                        Chapter 2

                     SYSOP PROCEDURES

     A sysop of an individual node can pretty much do as he pleases,
     as long as he observes the mail events, is not excessively
     annoying to other nodes on FidoNet, and does not promote the
     distribution of pirated copyrighted software.

     National Mail Hour is the heart of FidoNet, as this is when
     network mail is passed between systems.  Any listed system which
     wishes to be a part of FidoNet must be able to receive mail at
     FidoNews 5-04                Page 11                  25 Jan 1988


     this time.  A system which is a member of a network may also be
     required to observe additional mail events, as defined by his
     Network Coordinator.  The only exception to this rule is a
     private node.  A private node, for some reason between the node
     and the network coordinator, is not required to list his phone
     number in the node list.  The reason for being listed as private
     are of no concern to anyone, other than the network coordinator.
     Private status is allowed on the following conditions;

     1) The private node has satisfactory arrangements with the
     network coordinator that any incoming mail will be handled
     without delay.

     2) There are not an excessive number of private nodes within the
     net.

     Failure to observe the proper mail events is sufficient grounds
     for any node to be dropped from FidoNet without notice (since
     notice is generally given by FidoNet mail).

     Network mail systems generally operate unattended, and place
     calls at odd hours of the night.  If a system tries to call an
     incorrect or out of date number, it could cause some poor
     citizen's phone to ring in the wee hours of the morning, much to
     the annoyance of innocent bystanders and civil authorities.  For
     this reason, a sysop who sends mail is obligated to obtain and
     use the most recent edition of the node list as is practical.
     With the current level of automation in the distribution of the
     nodelist, using a nodelist more than two weeks out of date is
     cause for concern by the network coordinator, and is reason for
     excommunication.

     A system which has been dropped from the network is said to be
     excommunicated (i.e. unable to communicate).  A node which has
     been excommunicated may or may not be listed for a time in the
     "dog house", which is included in the comments at the end of the
     node list.  If you find that you have been excommunicated
     without warning, then that means that your coordinator was
     unable to contact you.  You should rectify the problem and
     report back.

     The exact timing of National Mail Hour is set for each zone by
     the International Coordinator, or by his designated Zone
     Coordinator.  In the United States, National Mail Hour is
     observed from 0900 to 1000 GMT every day, weekends included.  In
     each of the United States time zones, this would be as follows:

       Eastern Standard Time     4 AM to 5 AM
       Central Standard Time     3 AM to 4 AM
       Mountain Standard Time    2 AM to 3 AM
       Pacific Standard Time     1 AM to 2 AM
       Hawaii Standard Time     11 PM to Midnight

     FidoNet does not observe daylight savings time.  In areas which
     observe daylight savings time the FidoNet mail schedules must be
     adjusted in the same direction as the clock change.
     FidoNews 5-04                Page 12                  25 Jan 1988


     Alternatively, you can simply leave your system on standard
     time.

     2.1   How to get a node number

     You must first obtain a current node list so that you can send
     mail.  You do not need a node number to send mail, but you must
     have one in order for others to send mail to you.

     The first step in obtaining a current node list is to locate a
     Fido bulletin board.  Each network and regional coordinator is
     required to have a current, full nodelist available for
     downloading.  Most bulletin board lists include at least a few
     Fido systems, and usually identify them as such, so this
     shouldn't be too hard.

     If the sysop of any Fido system does not have a node list
     available for downloading, then he can probably tell you where
     to get one.

     Once you have a node list, you must determine which network or
     region covers your area.  Networks always have a three digit
     number.  Networks are more restricted in area than regions, but
     are generally preferred since they provide more services to
     their members.

     If you cannot find a network which covers your area, then pick
     the region which does.  Regions always have a two digit number.
     The United States is divided into ten regions, so that you are
     certainly in a region even if you are not near a network.

     Once you have located the network or region in your area, send a
     request for a node number to node zero of that network or
     region.  The request must be sent by FidoNet mail, and must
     include at least the following:

       1) Your name.
       2) The name of your system.
       3) The city and state where your system is located.
       4) The phone number to be used when calling your system.
       5) Your hours of operation.
       6) The maximum baud rate you can support.

     Your coordinator may want additional information.  If so, he
     will contact you.

     Please allow at least two weeks for a node number request to be
     processed.  If you send your request to a Regional Coordinator,
     then he may forward your request to the Network Coordinator who
     covers your area (if any), which may take longer.

     2.2   If you are going down

     If your node will be down for an extended period (more than a
     day or two), then you should inform your coordinator as soon as
     possible.  If you do not do this, then other systems will still
     FidoNews 5-04                Page 13                  25 Jan 1988


     try to reach you while you are down, much to the annoyance of
     everyone.  Do not under any circumstances put an answering
     machine or similar device on your phone line while you are down.
     If you do, then calling systems will get the machine repeatedly,
     racking up large phone bills, which is very annoying.  See the
     section on Resolution of Disputes for details on what happens to
     annoying people.

     If your system goes down without warning, then you may be placed
     in the dog house, or even removed from the node list completely.

     If you will be leaving your system unattended for an extended
     period of time (such as while you are on vacation), you should
     notify your coordinator.  Systems do have a tendency to "crash"
     now and then, so you will probably want your coordinator to know
     that it is a temporary condition if it happens while you are
     away.

     2.3   How to join a network

     If you are an independent node and would like to join a network
     in your area, you must contact the Network Coordinator.  He can
     be reached by sending FidoNet mail to node zero of the network.
     He will inform you of any special mail schedules and/or routing
     required by the network.  Your Regional Coordinator will contact
     you to confirm that you wish to join the network.  Once you have
     been placed in the network, you will be informed by the Network
     Coordinator.

     There are many advantages to being in a network.  First and
     foremost is that it helps reduce congestion of FidoNet during
     National Mail Hour.  Also, many networks are "outbound" as well
     as "inbound", which can substantially reduce your phone bills.
     In addition, network members receive regular updates of the node
     list and FidoNews, while an independent node may not.

     2.4   How to form a network

     If there are several nodes in your area, but no network, then
     you may wish to form your own.  Again, this has several
     advantages as outlined above.

     Your first step is to contact the other sysops in your area.
     You must decide which nodes will comprise the network, and which
     of those nodes is going to be the Network Coordinator.  Your
     next step is to inform your Regional Coordinator.  You must send
     him a FidoNet message with the following information:

     1) The region number(s), or network number(s) if a network is
     splitting up, that are affected by the formation of your
     network.  The Regional Coordinator will inform the International
     Coordinator and the coordinators of any affected networks that a
     new network is in formation.

     2) The name that you wish to call your network.  Please try to
     select a name that relates to your grouping.  For example,
     FidoNews 5-04                Page 14                  25 Jan 1988


     SoCalNet for nodes in the  Southern  California  Area  and
     MassNet  for Massachusetts Area.  Remember if you call yourself
     DOGNET it doesn't help others know what area of the country (or
     even what country) your group is in.

     3) A copy of the proposed network's nodelist.  The nodelist file
     should be named Frrr-nnn.NET where rrr is the proposed host's
     current region or network number and nnn is his current node
     number.  For example, if the proposed host is currently listed
     as node 5 in region 13, then you would name the file
     F013-005.NET.  This file should be sent attached to the message
     of Application for a Network Number.

              SAMPLE FORMAT OF A Frrr-nnn.NET FILE

     (Ed note:  St. Louis format NODELIST.BBS example goes here)

     Granting of a network number is not automatic.  Your Regional
     Coordinator will review your application and inform you of his
     decision.

     Do not send a network number request to the International
     Coordinator.  All network number requests must be processed by
     the Regional Coordinator.

                        Chapter 3

               NETWORK COORDINATOR PROCEDURES


     A Network Coordinator has the following responsibilities:

     1) To receive incoming mail for nodes in his network, and to
     deliver it to its recipients.

     2) To assign node numbers to nodes in his network.

     3) To maintain the node list for his network, and to send a copy
     of it to his Regional Coordinator whenever it changes.

     4) To pass along to his nodes new international node list
     updates and new issues of FidoNews as they are received.

     5) To forward newsletter submissions to the FidoNews publisher.

     3.1   Routing inbound mail

     It is your responsibility as Network Coordinator to receive all
     inbound mail for nodes in your network and to forward it to its
     recipients.  You are left to your own discretion as to how best
     to accomplish this.

     There are certain exceptions to this, however.  If a node in
     your network is sending and receiving inordinately large volumes
     of mail you can request that he cease and desist.  If he refuses
     to do so, then you can request your Regional Coordinator to
     FidoNews 5-04                Page 15                  25 Jan 1988


     assign the node a number as an independent and drop him from
     your node list.

     There are two main reasons why a node might generate
     exceptionally large volumes of mail.  Once in awhile a node will
     try to make a "bombing run" (sending one message to a great many
     nodes).  Bombing runs are considered to be the surest form of
     self extinction.  If any of your nodes make a bombing run
     outside of your net, it is reason for removal or
     excommunication.  If a node in another Network is making bombing
     runs on your nodes and routing them through your inbound host,
     then you can complain to the network and/or Regional Coordinator
     of the offending node.  Bombing runs are considered to be more
     than annoying, and should be dealt with accordingly.

     The other common source of routing overload is EchoMail.
     EchoMail is a nice invention, and offers great benefits, but it
     cannot be allowed to degrade the ability of FidoNet to handle
     normal message traffic.  If a node in your network is routing
     large volumes of EchoMail, or using more than a small amount of
     quoted replies, you can ask him to either limit the amount of
     EchoMail, or even to stop routing his EchoMail completely.  The
     design of EchoMail is such that it is a simple matter to do
     either of these.  Complaints regarding this matter, must be
     acted on immediately.  Complaints from other nets must be
     answered immediately, and if sufficient in number, can and
     should be used as a reason for excommunication.

     If at all possible, routing of Echomail should be held to a
     minimum during NMH.  Setting up of separate schedules for
     Echomail is to be encouraged.

     3.2   Assigning node numbers

     It is your responsibility to assign node numbers to new nodes in
     your network.  You may also change the numbers of existing nodes
     in your network, though you should check with your member nodes
     before doing so.  You may assign any numbers you wish, so long
     as each node has a unique number within your network.

     You should not assign a node number to any system unless and
     until you have received a formal request from that system by
     FidoNet mail.  This will ensure that the system is at least
     minimally operational.  In addition, you must make sure, by
     means of testing, that each new node can receive can receive and
     send both files and messages.  The strict maintenance of this
     policy has been one of the great strengths of FidoNet.

     It is also required that you call a board which is applying for
     a node number before assigning it a node number.

     You should use network mail, during NMH, to inform a new node of
     his node number, as this helps to insure that he is capable of
     receiving network mail.

     3.3   Maintaining the node list
     FidoNews 5-04                Page 16                  25 Jan 1988


     You should attempt to implement name changes, phone number
     changes, et cetera in your node list as soon as possible, and to
     forward the revised node list to your Regional Coordinator
     whenever a change occurs.

     You should also on occasion send a message to every node in your
     network to ensure that they are still operational.  If a node
     turns out to be "off the air" with no prior warning given to
     you, then you can either mark the node as down, place it in the
     dog house, or remove it from the node list completely, at your
     own discretion.

     If a node in your network is acting in an annoying manner, then
     you can take whatever action you deem fit, according to the
     circumstances of the case.

     3.4   Passing along node lists and FidoNews

     As a Network Coordinator you should obtain a new issue of
     FidoNews and a new international node list update every week.
     The node list update is posted weekly on Saturday, and FidoNews
     is published weekly on Monday.  Both will be made available to
     you by your Regional Coordinator.

     You should pass both of these along to your member nodes as soon
     as is practical after you receive them.  It is also required
     that you make the Nodelist available for downloading by the
     general user, but the FidoNews is not required, but is
     encouraged.

     FidoNews and the node lists are the glue that holds us together.
     Without them, we cease to be a community, and become just
     another random collection of bulletin boards.

     3.5   Forwarding newsletter submissions

     The node list gives us our structure, but FidoNews gives us our
     character.  FidoNews is the primary medium by which sysops hear
     from each other.  It is FidoNews which gives us the sense of
     being a community of people with common interests.  Also,
     FidoNews is the means whereby matters of policy affecting
     network organization are discussed and announced, and is
     therefore of importance to every sysop.

     Accordingly, you should encourage sysops and users in your
     network to contribute to FidoNews.  If you receive any
     submissions, you should forward them to the FidoNews publisher.
     Think of yourself as being a regional bureau chief on the
     FidoNews editorial staff.

               REGIONAL COORDINATOR PROCEDURES

     A Regional Coordinator has the following responsibilities:

     FidoNews 5-04                Page 17                  25 Jan 1988


     1) To assign node numbers to independent nodes in his region.

     2) To encourage independent nodes in his region to join existing
     networks, or to form new networks.

     3) To assign network numbers to networks in his region.

     4) To compile a node list of all of the networks and
     independents in his region, and to send a copy of it to the
     International Coordinator whenever it changes.

     5) To ensure the smooth operation of networks within his region.

     6) To make new international node list updates and new issues of
     FidoNews available to the Network Coordinators in his region as
     soon as is practical.

     7) To forward newsletter submissions to the FidoNews publisher.

     4.1   Assigning node numbers

     It is your responsibility to assign node numbers to new nodes in
     your region.  You may also change the numbers of existing nodes
     in your region, though you should check with the respective
     nodes before doing so.  You may assign any numbers you wish, so
     long as each node has a unique number within your region.

     The procedures that apply to network coordinators apply fully to
     you when assigning node numbers within the region.  If the new
     node is within the assigned region or is a local call for one of
     the network coordinator, then you should pass the request to the
     applicable network coordinator.

     4.2   Encouraging the formation and growth of networks

     One of your main duties as a Regional Coordinator is to promote
     the growth of networks in your region.

     You should try to avoid having independent nodes in your region
     which are within the coverage area of a network.  There are,
     however, certain cases where a node should not be a member of a
     network, such as a commercial system with a large volume of
     traffic which would clog the network.  The resolution of such
     special cases is left to your own discretion.

     If several independent nodes in your region are in a "clump",
     then you should encourage them to form a network.  Refer to the
     sysop procedure on forming a network for details of what
     information you should get.

     Note that this does not mean to encourage the formation of
     trivial networks.  Obviously, one node does not make a network.
     The exact number of nodes required for an effective network must
     be judged according to the circumstances of the situation, and
     is left to your own discretion.

     FidoNews 5-04                Page 18                  25 Jan 1988


     4.3   Assigning network numbers

     It is your responsibility to assign network numbers to new
     networks forming within your region.  You are assigned a pool of
     network numbers to use for this purpose.  This pool consists of
     ten numbers starting at your region number plus ten, times ten.
     For example, if you are the Regional Coordinator for region 13,
     then your network number pool consists of the numbers 230
     through 239.  If you need more numbers than this, then you
     should ask the International Coordinator for additional numbers
     as they are needed.

     4.4   Maintaining the node list

     As a Regional Coordinator, you have a dual role in maintaining
     the node list for your region.

     First, you must maintain the list of independent nodes in your
     region.  You should attempt to implement name changes, phone
     number changes, and so forth in this node list as soon as
     possible.  You should also on occasion send a message to every
     independent node in your region to ensure that they are still
     operational.  If a node turns out to be "off the air" with no
     prior warning given to you, then you can either mark the node as
     down, place it in the dog house, or remove it from the node list
     completely, at your own discretion.

     Second, you must receive the node lists from the Network
     Coordinators within your region.  You should assemble a master
     node list for your region every week and send it to the
     International Coordinator no later than National Mail Hour on
     Friday morning.  It is suggested that you do this as late as is
     practical, so as to accommodate any late changes.

     You will need to maintain a set of node lists for each network
     within your region, since you cannot count on getting an update
     from each Network Coordinator every week.

     4.5   Overseeing network operations

     It is your responsibility as Regional Coordinator to ensure that
     the networks within your region are operating in an acceptable
     manner.  This does not mean that you are required to operate
     those networks; that is the responsibility of the Network
     Coordinators.  It means that you are responsible for seeing to
     it that the Network Coordinators within your region are acting
     responsibly.

     If you find that a Network Coordinator within your region is not
     properly performing his duties (as outlined above), then you
     should take whatever immediate action you deem necessary to
     correct the situation.

     It is your obligation as Regional Coordinator to maintain direct
     and reasonably frequent contact with the networks in your
     region.  The exact method of accomplishing this is left to your
     FidoNews 5-04                Page 19                  25 Jan 1988


     discretion.

     4.6   Passing along node lists and FidoNews

     As a Regional Coordinator, it is your responsibility to obtain
     the latest international node list updates and the latest issues
     of FidoNews as they are published, and to make them available to
     the Network Coordinators within your region.  The node list is
     posted weekly on Friday by node 1/0, and FidoNews is published
     weekly on Monday by node 1/1.  Contact them for more details on
     how to obtain the latest copies each week.

     It  is your responsibility to make these available to any and
     all Network Coordinators in your region as soon as is practical
     after you receive them.  The method of distribution is left to
     your discretion.  You are not required to distribute them to any
     independent nodes in your region, though you may if you wish.
     It is required that you make the Nodelist available for
     downloading by the general user, but the Fidonews is not
     required, but it must be available for forwarding by at least
     one of the nodes within your region.  .

     4.7   Forwarding newsletter submissions

     You should encourage sysops and users in your region to
     contribute to FidoNews.  If you receive any submissions, you
     should forward them to the FidoNews publisher.  Think of
     yourself as being a regional bureau chief on the FidoNews
     editorial staff.

        REDCON/GEDCON have been going thru several changes
     in recent months. REDCON now handles over 200 ECHO's.
     It's a full time job keeping up with the changes. REDCON
     is now running AUTOECHO to help with some of the work.

        Because REDCON is in a PC Pursuit city the traffic
     has been very heavy. All weekend long the machine sends
     and receives traffic.

        Thanks to the efforts of all the users feedback loops
     in the echomail paths have been, for the most part, avoided.

        GEDCON has been slower to develop. Because GEDCON's
     users are billed for the time on the system monthly. An
     accounting program had to be written. That is now done.
     Also an automatic billing system is in place. So as time
     permit we will be adding users again.

        To other ECHOMAIL BACKBONE(tm) sysops. Please contact us
     so we may better coordinate our efforts to provide ECHOMAIL
     services to the nodes of an even stronger FidoNet.

        A list of the ECHOMAIL handled by REDCON/GEDCON is in
     a file REDCON.ARC which may be requested from 151/100 or
     151/1000. Soon AUTOECHO will respond to the QUERY option
     and send a message to any requesting system all the echo's
     available.

        Now let's see... A ten jewel lazer ...
     Amnon got any spare 10 meter dishes ?????
     Signals have been bounced off the moon before....

     Ben Mann
     OPUS 151/0

                          SOUTHERNET(tm)

      When I saw the message (spelled flames) about the
     formation of another net/node list I was both happy
     and sad. Happy that there is going to be more than
     just one net around and sad that AlterNet(tm) has
     been met with such fear and distain by IFNA and the
     higher ups in FidoNet.

      I for one think it's time for ANOTHER(tm) net. I have
     been sending net 151's net/nodes to ANOTHER(tm) net
     for some time. It's called SOUTHERNET. It was set up
     so the ECHO's could get thru in the event of a BROWN out
     like happened with the FidoNet nodelist several times.
     I'am sure alot of you have  PRIVATE(tm) nodelists. They
     might not have a name, but that's the only difference.

      Why clutter the issue with ANOTHER(tm) net? Because
     cream always rises to the top. And in America it's
     competition NOT complacency that breeds the best.

      Will the new nodelist hurt FidoNet? I think not. The
     programs are there that support alternate nodelist now.
     There are enough nodes to build several nets. So let
     the games begin.

      One final thing I would like to see. Is node licensing
     like a HAM callsign. It's issued to a node and forever
     belongs to him/her. It can then be listed by any nodelist.
     It can't be revoked once it's issued. In this way each
     node has an idenity of it's own. And NOT subject to the
     whim (good or bad) of anyone. The node can then elect who
     they want to be their leaders. That's why ARRL works
     and IFNA doesn't. Leaders should work for the nodes, NOT
     the nodes for the leaders.

      The idea of a NMH (national mail hour) has gone by the
     boards. Current software that supports CPD (call progress
     detection) can tell if it's a voice answer and not redial.
     So there no need for a certain mail hour.

      If someone out there does take the licencing issue
     seriously. How about the net being the area code of the
     node? Then you would know where the node was your about
     to call. Na! Sounds to simple to work.

     And you thought your computer was flakey.  Here is a story about
     mans greatest  probe  ever launched  into space and  its flakes.
     This is  an  actual account  of  Voyager  1 and  the problems it
     encountered December  13'th, 1979.  Written by  Fredric L. Rice,
     August  1985.  Original  reference  material  may  be  found  at

     There is a concept making the rounds  describing the attitude of
     electronic equipment when it desides  to do something out of the
     ordinary,  by itself,  without  being  asked to.  The concept is
     titled "Digi-nerds". It may include just about anything you care
     to name. It strikes once, leaving much damage.

     The cause of digi-nerds is not known. Perhaps cosmic rays, which
     bombard us constantly,  strike our  equipment,  mutating  a zero
     into a one, or  a one  into a  zero.  The  result  may  never be
     noticed, or it may spell disaster for your bank account.

     When Voyager  1  completed  its  mid-course correction, December
     13'th, 1979, it met up with a digi-nerd at 48,000 miles an hour,
     and 619 million miles from home.

     The course  correction  required a  37 minute  burn to  effect a
     change in speed of eleven miles  an hour.  During that time, the
     radio dish had to be turned away from its Earth-Line so that the
     engine  would  be  aligned  according  to  its flight  plan. The
     Voyager  vehicles  were  designed  to  carry   out   complicated
     maneuvers like  this  without  requiring  any  instructions from
     Earth.

     All went according to plan; Saturn had been treated  to  a  rare
     and beautiful sight of a new  star  tracking through its distant
     skys. After the main burn,  an inhabitant of  Saturn, (if he had
     had a good telescope), might have  seen  some additional flashes
     as Voyager  attempted to realign  itself to its Earth-Line using
     its attitude control thrusters.

     Voyager 1 regains its Earth orientation  by locating the Sun and
     the star Canopus. When the Sun tracker  is  locked onto the Sun,
     and the star tracker is  locked onto  Canopus, the radio disk is
     aligned exactly at Earth. When contact was  not restored at 3:13
     p.m. P.S.T.  on December  13, it  was known  that  something had
     gone wrong.

     To find the Sun, the vehicle rotates  itself a  few degrees at a
     FidoNews 5-04                Page 23                  25 Jan 1988


     time until the Sun tracker lockes  onto  the Sun.  There is only
     one stellar object that can be  as  bright at  the Sun, (even at
     711 million miles the Sun is an impressive sight).  When the Sun
     is  positivly  identified,  the  vehicle  rotates  itself  along
     another axis until the star tracker locates Canopus.

     The Deep Space Network Antenna located in  Madrid  heard a faint
     signal from Voyager. This gave the scientist  the  idea that the
     probe was basicly healthy but somehow simply misaligned. Even if
     this be the case, if  the  device  was too  badly misaligned, it
     might not be able to read a command from Earth telling it how to
     find Earth again.

     Voyager 1 was on the verge of being lost  forever. Adrift in the
     heavens with no possibility of being recovered. Unable to report
     its posistion and the cause of its ailments.

     Dr. Jones and his Spacecraft Team knew  that Alpha  Centauri and
     Rigel could deceive the  star tracker.  Based on the possibility
     that one  of  these  stars  was  locked  onto,  the  team beamed
     instructions through  the Deep  Space  Network at  Madrid to the
     lost spacecraft in the hopes  that a  strong enough signal could
     be read. Dr. Jones directed the  spacecraft to align itself with
     the assumption that it was locked onto Alpha Centauri.

     Voyager 1 did receive the instructions,  and  it  did attempt to
     realign itself according to its new instructions. Alpha Centauri
     was the wrong star.  Radio contact  was  not  improved after the
     spacecraft completed its instructions.

     Next,  Voyager was  instructed  to  realign  itself  base on the
     assumption it was locked onto Rigel.  This did not improve radio
     reception, causing much disappointment to the Spacecraft Team.

     Though they did not  know what  star Voyager was locked on, they
     did know that from its point of view the Sun  and Earth appeared
     eight degrees apart.  If the spacecraft could be  made to wobble
     out an eight  degree cone, the signal from  the spacecraft could
     be made to sweep accross the Earth every now  and then, and they
     would  be  able  to  learn  more  information  about  where  the
     spacecraft was pointing.

     The maneuver worked.  On December 16'th, almost complete contact
     was regained through the Canberra, Australia,  tracking station.
     Total loss of signal time exceeded 71 hours.  In  order to learn
     why the spacecraft  has gone  astray, Dr.  Jones  and  his  team
     ordered it to replay all information it had on what had happened
     for  the   last   three   days.   Records  showed  an  error  in
     communications between  two on  board  computers, and  there was
     nothing showing  to  restrict  another attempt  to regain normal
     contact.  The  spacecraft  was  instructed  to  go  through  its
     Earth-Find  maneuver  December  19'th,  and  on  December 20'th,
     Voyager was again in full contact with the Earth.

     Reconstruction of the detailed  data Voyager offered showed that
     the spacecrafts master computer had ordered a secondary computer
     FidoNews 5-04                Page 24                  25 Jan 1988


     to shut down the  engines  at  the end of the course correction.
     Commands such as this are requested twice, and it was the second
     instruction that  got  garbled  between  the two computers.  The
     first instruction  had indeed  shut  down  the  engines  yet the
     second  corrupted  instruction  was   not   understood   by  the
     secondary  computer.   This   computer   reported   the  strange
     instruction to the master computer who declaired an abort.

     When a spacecraft abort is executed, all operations  are  thrown
     away and the Earth-Find maneuver is executed.  Voyager did this,
     and in fact did find the Sun. It was while the spacecraft was on
     its search for Canopus that another emergency was detected.

     The attitude  control  system  reported  a leak  in the  primary
     thrusters. Actually, the master computer had requested from 1026
     to 1094 "shots" from the  attitude control thrusters,  while the
     attitude control computer interprets more  than 1000 as evidence
     of a leak. It  reported  a  problem  and  the  star  search  was
     aborted.

     So there it stood, with only  a minimal  contact with Earth; its
     star tracker not pointing at  any  known object.  The spacecraft
     was compleatly  healthy  but  for  no  known  reason  a  garbled
     transmission from the master computer to the slave had triggered
     an emergency.

     There had been more than five hundred thousand  instructions  to
     cross its data bus,  and it  had  already  executed six previous
     Earth Find maneuvers.

     Sometimes our failures turn out  to be  our biggest triumphs. To
     defeat a problem which  might end  our achievements is  a better
     boost to our  moral  than  the  defeating  of  a  known  hazard,
     (Remember Apolo  13  and  the  problems  circumvented  by  those
     aboard).

     The space shuttle will no  doubt encounter  digi-nerds on one of
     its many scheduled flights. We can only hope it wont be over 600
     million miles away when it does.

        Authors notes:

        The Griffith Observer is a  publication that  everyone who is
        interested in astronomy  should subscribe to.  At the time of
        this articles  release into  the Public  Domain, 12 issues of
        the Griffith Observer were going for $5.00. This money, after
        paying for the  publication costs, goes  towards the "Friends
        of the  Observatory" fund.  Edwin C. Krupp,  who  manages the
        building, (who also hosted the series "Project Universe" that
        you have probibly seen on public television),  uses the money
        to  maintain   the  observatory.    If  you  want  additional
