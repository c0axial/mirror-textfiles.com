Editorial: Who me?

by Tom Jennings (1:1/1)


For a refreshing change, there is only one article, three echo
announcements, and nothing to put up with from your editor.

My long, dragged out job is about to end in the next few days.
Freedom! I will, I swear, write about my experiences at the Computers,
Freedom, and Privacy Conference in Wash. DC a few weeks back. I swear.

But for now, goodbye...

By Dave Bliss, 1:3639/4

                A suggestion for a binary nodelist

  Here's my proposal for a compressed binary nodelist format.
Suggestions are welcome and should be sent to 1:3639/4.  I don't know
how portable this will be to non-IBMs tho.  But, here goes:

Layout of individual record:
Number,System_name,Sysop_name,Location,Number,Max_Baud,2-Byte_Flag,Uxx
xx/Gxxxx flags

  To identify the start of a ZONE, the System_name will start with the
~ character, followed by a capital Z.  To identify the start of a
REGION, the name will start with ~R, and a network, ~N.  A hub is
indicated by a ~H in front of the name.  CASE IS SIGNIFICANT.  Number
is the zone, region, net, or node number, in unsigned long integer
format (Up to 65,536).  Numbers beyond this cannot be expressed.  ALL
TEXT, including the ~ combinations, is compressed, by converting each
letter into a 7-bit byte then assembling the 7-bit bytes into a
bitstream, which is then separated into 8-bit bytes.  That saves 1/8th
of the text space right there!  It is possible for a combination of
characters to combine and come up as a comma, in which case the comma
must be 'escaped' with a ~.  Any ~ appearing in the file that should
show as ~ must also be 'escaped', and shown as ~~.  Commas, being
separators, are exempt from this compression. Number is the phone
number, in a special format.  The high nibble of the first byte is the
country code.  The rest of the number is stored by converting each
2-digit section into the character for that ASCII code, and stringing
them together.  Max_baud is the max effective CPS rate (and can be
14.4k, etc), stored as an unsigned long integer.  2-byte flag replaces
all current FidoNet flags except Gxxx and Uxxx flags.  Each bit
represents a flag, in the following key:

0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
ON! CM  MO HST V32 V42 H96 V32b ^   XA  XB  XC  XP  XX     ON!
                               V42b

If I left out any of the St. Louis flags, tell me please!  Notice that
in this format redundant flags make no size difference so it's not
necessary to do anything about them.  It may be possible for one or
the other of the bytes to work out to a comma, in which case it can be
safely ignored since this is a fixed-length field.  The fields marked
'ON!' should ABSOLUTELY ALWAYS be 1, so that the fields can never
equate to nul.  Gxxx and Uxxx fields follow the flag field, comma
separated, and they ARE subject to the text compression described
earlier.  However they need not be present!  I know this format takes
a LOT of manipulation in ram to access it, but it is also VERY
compact.  If you think it should be less compact and therefore faster,
let me know.  But I suspect that this would reduce the nodelist to a
size of about (very rough estimate) 700k.  Maybe more, maybe less, but
that what I'd figure.  I am in the process of writing a conversion

util.  If you have any suggestions, PLEASE send them to me, either in
netmail or thru FidoNews.

                        HOWLING AT THE MOON

By Bill Jones & Missy Cauldwell, 1:231/370.

    A new echo is wandering about the reaches of Region 11.  It's
called the DOGHOUSE.  What're we here for?  Well, we're all dog
lovers, actually.  We love to get dirty and play with our favorite
pooch and brag about it to everyone else.  Sound like fun?  Read on!

    We got the idea for this echo in KATTY_KORNER.  Someone pointed
out that there was a whole dedicated echo for the feline persuasion,
the poor hounds had been left out in the cold.  This just wouldn't do
for a network named after a dog, so DOGHOUSE was born.

    A little about us.  We're the proud owners of a chow/shepard mix.
We "inhereted" her about six months ago and have loved having her
ever since.  Missy has also owned a shepard, shepard-husky and a pit
bull.  I've been somewhat of a Labrador fan for many years (I've
owned four).

    Please join us and chat it up about your favorite canine.  If
you're in Region 11, you should be able to obtain DOGHOUSE along with
the rest of your regional level echos.  If you're having difficulty,
please contact Bruce Berna or myself.  For those outside of the
midwest, you can contact me at 1:231/370 or Don Packwood at 1:231/50
to arrange for a feed.  Please note that if you're using InterMail, my
term software will not send to you (it receives fine) - you'll need to
feed from Don.  Of course, we'd like to get oodles of you involved so
we can move up to the Zone 1 backbone.

    Thanks for reading out our little project.  We hope you can make
it.

Announcing MAILBAG, by Charles Lasitter, 1:3641/1.206

This is a mail conference about the production and mass distribution of
letters, magazines and advertising circulars.  This conference is
oriented towards computerized processing of lists and production of
computer letters and labels.  The conference also covers postal
regulations and matters of printing and design relating to compliance
with those regulations.

FidoNews 9-16                  Page 4                      20 Apr 1992


The conference is open to discussions concerning mailings of 200 pieces
or more.  This excludes single-piece 1st class, 3rd class, and parcels,
but little else.  The conference is primarily oriented towards domestic
US mailings.  Extensive discussions of international mailings and any
discussion of mailings originating and destinating outside US should be
conducted elsewhere.

Topics on computerized processing includes areas such as Zip+4 and
other postal code assignments.  It also covers postal barcoding, walk
sequencing, CASS certification, National Change of Address processing,
automated ACS participation, Manifest Postage Payment, Optional
Procedure, Drop Shipping, Palletization and Destination entry.

Other areas of computerized processing include file conversion and
duplicate detection (merge/purge), ink jet and other methods of
addressing, and address standardization.

The conference will also address topics involving current and proposed
postal regulations, and to a lesser extent how changes in work rules or
other results of collective bargaining might change the flow of mail.

With 750,000 postal employees and numerous bargaining units in the US,
conference participants will be required to maintain civility in any
discussions of these latter areas.  No ad-hominem ("Union Brothers vs
Scabs") attacks will be tolerated.

Distribution will be private until sufficient interest warrants
otherwise.  Net-Mail Richard Lee, 1:3641/1 to get plugged in.

New RF4SALE Echo Available
by Bill Weinel 1:151/121.0

Just a quick note to all you RF enthusiasts, technicians, 2-way folks,
and hams out there....

The new RF4SALE echo is now available from 151/121, 151/155, 321/131,
or 151/1003. RF4SALE is available to all nodes in North America.

I started RF4SALE in order to try to fill a gap by allowing all RF
related sale items to be placed in one echo. This allows 'cross-over
RF enthusiasts' (such as myself) with interests in both ham gear and
commercial gear to place all their ads on one echo. It is coordinated
from 1:151/121.0 by myself. I have tried to limit RF4SALE strictly to
the buying and selling of RF related gear (ie: RF test gear, 2-way
equipment, ham gear, receivers, transmitters, repeaters, antennas,
scanners, etc.). If your into trading  this type of stuff... Then
RF4SALE is the place to do it.

FidoNews 9-16                  Page 5                      20 Apr 1992


The rules are few and pretty simple:

General Ground rules:

       1.  No flames or personal attacks or insults allowed.
       2.  No personal messages or "chatting".
       3.  Only legal merchandise is to be advertised in RF For-Sale.
           11m power amplifiers are considered illegal in the
           context of this echo.
       4.  No BBS Ads.
       5.  NO illegal activity or item may be advertised.  Any
           person breaking this rule will be immediately removed
           from the echo.  No warnings, no exceptions.
       6.  Be friendly.
       7.  Arguing with the moderator in the echo is defined as
           "excessively annoying" and shall result in the
           immediate cutting of feeds.
       8.  No Ascii artwork.  It takes up too much space and some
           systems choke on the wrong characters.

Strong suggestions:    (Not mandatory)

       1.  Put a price on it.  Its nice to know how much you
           expect for your stuff.
       2.  Don't take offense at a counter offer.  If its too
           low, just say so, or ignore it.
       3.  We would all like to know where you are and a phone
           number (including Area Code) where you can be reached.
           Some boards don't put enough info in their Origin lines
           so please provide complete information.

Commercial advertising is acceptable as follows:

Commercial Advertising Rules:

     1)  The seller must identify himself/herself as a
         commercial interest.

     2)  The items posted should be of a 'one of a kind' or
         closeout special, not a regular stock item.

     3)  Commercial posts must be limited to 1 per month and
         must include full contact information including phone
         number. All prices must be stated in post.

I hope you'll give RF4SALE a try. I believe it has the real potential
to be of use to you whatever your RF interests might be.
