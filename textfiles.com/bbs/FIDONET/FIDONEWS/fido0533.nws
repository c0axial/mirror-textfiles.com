     From:     System Enhancement Associates, Inc. (SEA)
               and
               PKWARE, Inc. and Phillip W. Katz (PK)


     August 2 1988 - Milwaukee, WI

     In the first known "Shareware" litigation,  pending in the  local
     United  States  District  Court,  the  parties System Enhancement
     Associates, Inc. (Plaintiff - SEA) and PKWARE, Inc.  / Phillip W.
     Katz  (Defendants - PK),  after reaching agreement,  consented to
     the entry of the attached  Judgment  for  Plaintiff  on  Consent.
     That Judgment was entered by Judge Myron L.  Gordon, effective on
     August 2, 1988.

     Part   of  the  agreement  reached  by  the  parties  included  a
     Confidential Cross-License Agreement under which SEA licensed  PK
     for  all  the  ARC compatible programs published by PK during the
     period beginning with the first release of PKXARC  in  late  1985
     through July 31, 1988 in return for the payment of an agreed upon
     sum which was not disclosed.  Additionally,  PK was licensed, for
     an agreed  upon  royalty  payment,  to  distribute  its  existing
     versions of PK's ARC compatible programs until January 31,  1989,
     after which PK is not licensed  and  agreed  not  to  publish  or
     distribute  any ARC compatible programs or utilities that process
     ARC compatible files.  In exchange,  PK licensed SEA to  use  its
     source code for PK's ARC compatible programs.

     PK agreed to cease any use of SEA's trademark "ARC" and to change
     the  names  or  marks  used  with  PK's programs to non-confusing
     designations.

     The Judgment provided for the standard copyright,  trademark  and
     unfair competition injunctive relief for SEA against PK,  as well
     as damages and litigation expenses to be paid by PK to SEA.

     Both parties agreed to refrain from any  comment  concerning  the
     settlement  of  the  disputes,  other than the text of this press
     release.    Also,   the   parties   instructed   all   of   their
     representatives to refrain from any such activity.

     Any  other  details of the Cross-License Agreement were agreed to
     be maintained in confidence and under seal of the Court.

     In reaching the agreement to dispose of  the  pending  litigation
     and  to settle the disputes that are covered thereby,  PK did not
     admit any fault or wrongdoing.

                     THE VERY BEST PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE


     Programming languages have improved dramatically since the inven-
     tion of early high-order languages like Basic and Fortran.   Many
     of us now program our PCs in Pascal,  C,  or  Modula 2.  However,
     Ada is an  improvement  over these languages,  with some exciting
     new features  not found in other  languages.   These features let
     Ada detect errors at  compile  time that other  languages  detect
     only at run time,  or not at all.   They also make  Ada  programs
     much easier to understand.  There are now at least three Ada com-
     pilers available for the PC for less than $100.

     Although it was originally invented for a specific purpose  (real
     time control of large,  embedded  systems),  Ada turned out to be
     the best  GENERAL PURPOSE  language  as well.   Because Ada's new
     features  help guard  against  bugs and make  programs  easier to
     read,  the U.S. Department of Defense ordered that all new criti-
     cal software be written in Ada.

     Ada isn't  particularly  easy  to  learn.   It's said to be seven
     times as much to learn as Pascal.   Because of this, I originally
     disliked Ada and hoped it would go away.   Apparently  many other
     beginners  shared  my  feeling.  "If it's mandated by the govern-
     ment, it must be bad!"  However,  after I studied Ada further and
     learned about its improvements  over earlier languages,  I became
     an enthusiastic convert.   I now do almost 100% of my programming
     in Ada.  I taught a  graduate  course in Ada at the State Univer-
     sity of New York at Binghamton,  and also taught Ada to employees
     of General Electric Co., Grumman Corp., and Harris Corp.

     To make Ada as easy to learn as possible,  I've written an inter-
     active  tutor program called  ADA-TUTR.   It's much more thorough
     than  the  "quizzes"  found  with  some  Ada compilers.  I'd like
     everyone to have a chance to learn Ada, so I released ADA-TUTR as
     Shareware with a low registration fee.  There's also a unique way
     for you to earn money distributing ADA-TUTR that's different from
     other Shareware programs.  See "A POSSIBLE SOLUTION TO THE SHARE-
     WARE PROBLEM"  in this issue of  FidoNews  (or in a nearby issue)
     for more details.

     ADA-TUTR  emphasizes that Ada isn't just another language,  but a
     whole new  programming  philosophy.   Beware of learning just Ada
     syntax,  or you'll write Basic-like  (or Pascal-like, etc.)  pro-
     grams that happen to be coded in  Ada.   Such programs would fail
     to  take  advantage  of  Ada's new features.   Instead,  ADA-TUTR
     teaches good program  DESIGN  along with Ada syntax.  This should
     make the student enthusiastic about Ada's special features.

     ADA-TUTR does NOT require an Ada compiler when run on a PC.  How-
     ever, a list of Ada compilers available for the PC is included in
     the documentation.   An Ada compiler is helpful,  because with it
     FidoNews 5-33                Page 6                   15 Aug 1988


     the tutor can check the "homework" assignments.

     Most Shareware doesn't include the source code with  unregistered
     copies.   However,  I included the Ada source code with  ADA-TUTR
     for two reasons.  First, the student can study the source code if
     he wishes.  Second, the source can be transferred to any computer
     with an Ada compiler, and then be compiled and run.  For example,
     I've successfully installed  ADA-TUTR  on several mainframes, in-
     cluding two VAX  (tm, Digital Equipment Corp.)  computers running
     different Ada compilers.  Ada programs tend to be very portable.

     In future articles,  I'll try to give examples showing WHY Ada is
     an  improvement  over other languages.  In the meantime,  you can
     find  ADA-TUTR.ARC  on the following  boards in  Zone 1:  11/210,
     18/8,  101/45, 106/504, 107/210, 110/55, 112/9, 124/210, 124/211,

     363/6, 363/10, 377/1.   Many of these boards allow  Bark or WaZoo
     file requests outside National Mail Hour.  I welcome any comments
     and suggestions you may have.

               EchoList - The EchoMail Conference List
                        (It's bAAAAaaaack...)

     Ever wonder what all those EchoMail conferences are about?
     Ever wonder if there was already a conference on some
     specific topic?  Well that's why the EchoList was originally
     created.  And that's why I've resurrected it.

     For those of you who might not be familiar with it, a little
     history...

     The EchoList is an informal listing of EchoMail conferences,
     as described by each conference's moderator.  It is now a
     monthly publication which attempts to document certain
     interesting information about EchoMail Conferences;
     "interesting" to people who would like to participate,
     interesting to EchoMail Coordinators and those who route the
     conference traffic, and potentially interesting to the
     Conference Moderator.  The base product of the EchoList
     database is the detailed Conference listing.  But, as needs
     are identified which can be satisfied with the available
     information, additional reports and analyses can be
     developed.

     The EchoList was originated by Thomas Kenny, who maintained
     it as a text file completely manually.  It was a time
     consuming effort, and was updated on a very sporadic and
     infrequent basis.  The last edition published this way was
     December 1987.

     Several people (myself included) were working with Thomas on
     developing ways to automate the maintenance, and provide a
     structured database that could be used for things other than
     a simple conference listing.  As a result, he assembled a
     specification for submitting messages that would be used for
     updating the list.  Unfortunately, Thomas decided to drop
     out of FidoNet before any of the code was completed.  He
     continues to have my gratitude for all he put in to getting
     the EchoList as far as he did.

     Since I was interested (for purely personal desire) in
     having an EchoList, I picked-up that last 1987 EchoList,
     built an R:base database and application, and keyed the
     whole thing in.  The result is a semi-automated update
     application, and some nice report generation facilities.
     There's a lot more to be done.  It's still a VERY labor-
     intensive task.  But, I'm happy to say I've been able to
     publish all updates received for the last 3 months on-time.
     Now, I'm going to try and ruin that by inviting more
     updates...

     HISTORY LESSON OVER...
     That's why I wrote this article.  It has been pointed out to
     FidoNews 5-33                Page 8                   15 Aug 1988


     me that there are a lot of people who don't realize the
     EchoList is available.  Most importantly, there are a lot of
     Conference Moderators who don't know, and as a result their
     conferences aren't in, or will soon be dropped from, that
     list.

     You see, one of things that seems to be widely agreed upon
     is that, in order to be really useful, an EchoList needs
     some control criteria.  Hating bureaucracy as I do, I've
     only implemented two (at this point).  First, in order to be
     listed, a conference must have a responsible party to whom
     questions can be directed; that person is the Moderator.
     Second, since reference information is only valuable if it's
     up-to-date, an EchoList conference entry must be updated via
     message to me on a regular basis.

     So there's the reason for the article.  A number of
     conferences have already been dropped because they had no
     moderator identified.  (How anybody's supposed to join a
     conference when there's no one identified to contact, I'll
     never know, but so be it.)  The other thing is that most of
     the entries' last-update dates are VERY old.  Starting with
     this next EchoList, I will start enforcing a purge criteria.
     An awful lot of conferences will be dropped as a result.
     Many are dead wood anyway.  But there are many such
     conferences I know are alive and well, and I hope this
     article gets the message to those moderators.  If you
     frequent a conference important to you, how about letting
     the moderator know about the EchoList?

     Oh yeah, I lied.  There is one more control, but it is for
     the Moderators themselves.  A Moderator can submit an entry
     that becomes password protected.  From then-on, the
     moderator has some feeling of control over the information
     listed in the EchoList for their conference.

     SO, HOW DO YOU UPDATE THE ECHOLIST?
     There are two ARC files that I publish.  One is the EchoList
     itself--which I'll get back to.  The other is ELISTMOD.ARC.
     It is essential that you get a copy of this file, as it
     contains detailed instructions on the update message format
     and contents.  This article is going to be too long as it
     is, so I can't put the whole thing here.  Suffice it to say,
     it's a fairly simple, but strictly structured, message
     format that has to be NetMailed to me at 1:1/201.

     The other file I referred-to is ELISTnnn.ARC, where nnn is
     the edition.  The August 1, 1988 edition is X03, and it
     contains the basic, detailed Conference list, and a few
     ancillary cross-reference listings.  I ship both of these
     files, when updated, to each of the Regional EchoMail
     Coordinators in the U.S., plus the Zone Gates for Zones 2,
     3, and 7 (in hopes they will pass them along).  I have no
     idea whether any of these people pass them along, make them
     available for download, or what.  I just hope they do.  If
     you can't find them locally, you can use the "magic" file
     FidoNews 5-33                Page 9                   15 Aug 1988


     names (specify them without a period or file extension):

       ECHOMOD  - to get the latest EchoList update instructions,
       ECHOLIST - to get the latest EchoList,

     in a SEAdog or WaZoo file request to 1:1/201.  They are also
     first-time-user downloadable from my BBS at (201)506-0472.

     WHAT IS A MODERATOR?
     I needed to establish some definitions for the EchoList, so
     these are MY definitions and others' may vary.  Critical to
     the identification of an EchoMail conference is the
     identification of its Moderator.  A  Moderator is the person
     who defines a Conference, and keeps it on track; making sure
     message content is within reasonable bounds of the topic for
     which the conference exists.  A Moderator should also set
     the base rules of the conference and cut off abuses of the
     media when they occur.  IF A CONFERENCE HAS NO MODERATOR, IT
     WILL NOT BE LISTED IN THE ECHOLIST.  If you know of a
     conference which you feel is important to the community and
     it doesn't have a moderator I seriously suggest you consider
     the job.  Basically, then, the Moderator "owns" the
     CONFERENCE.

     This is specifically contrasted with ECHOMAIL COORDINATORS.
     A dedicated group of volunteers have identified themselves
     as willing to expedite distribution of national EchoMail
     conferences.  There is (identified at the beginning of the
     NodeList) a National EchoMail Coordinator, and one Regional
     EchoMail Coordinator for each FidoNet Region.  These people
     run the National EchoMail Backbone, and facilitate timely
     and accurate distribution of the bigger conferences in the
     U.S.  They "own" that particular distribution channel, not
     the Conferences themselves.

     There are also nodes who can afford to aggregate a large
     number of Conferences and facilitate distribution.  They are
     frequently referred to as EchoMail Hubs, though it's a
     fairly unofficial title, I think.

     SO WHAT'S IN IT?
     I don't want to make this article too long, but as a brief
     overview:

     The minimum information required for an EchoList entry
     includes:  The Symbolic Area Name used by the conference, A
     Title or brief descriptive phrase for the conference, the
     Moderator's Name and the Moderator's Node Number.  Certain
     Moderators do not want to publicize the AREA: name, and the
     ability to supress the display of the Area Name in the
     EchoList is provided.  Perhaps the best way to show all the
     various fields in the EchoList is to show the format for
     submitting additions and updates, so an EchoList update
     message would be...

                A POSSIBLE SOLUTION TO THE SHAREWARE PROBLEM


     What Shareware problem?  The problem of people not paying for the
     Shareware they use, of course.

     Shareware is an ideal answer to the problems  of high-priced com-
     mercial software,  copy protection,  and  illegal  copying.   The
     Shareware author says,  "Go ahead.   Make all the copies you want
     and give them away.   Try the program  for free.   But if you use
     it, please send in $X to register your copy."

     The registration fee is usually small.  You're on your honor; you
     know if you're "using" the program or only "trying" it.   Usually
     there are  incentives  to  register,  such as a year of technical
     support and the right to get updates very cheaply.

     I don't think we have any way of knowing how severe is the  prob-
     lem of users not paying for Shareware,  because we have no way to
     tell  how many users there are.   We do know that some  Shareware
     programs are failures,  while others,  like  PC-Write  (tm Quick-
     soft), are phenomenally successful.

     PC-Write gives users an extra incentive to register.  The program
     contains a serial number which is displayed at startup.  When you
     register  for $89,  you mention this serial number and  Quicksoft
     assigns you a new number.  Before giving away copies, you put the
     new number into the program.  Then, for each person who registers
     from one of your copies  (mentioning your serial number),  Quick-
     soft sends you a commission of $25.

     I've received more money from Quicksoft than I spent to register,
     because  four or more people registered from my copies.   Thus  I
     actually earned money on a program I didn't even write!  We read-
     ers of FidoNews have a special advantage in distributing  copies,
     because almost all  of  us  have  modems  and  access to bulletin
     boards.

     I BELIEVE THE SOLUTION TO THE SHAREWARE PROBLEM  IS TO CARRY THIS
     EXTRA INCENTIVE A STEP FURTHER.

     I've written a Shareware program called ADA-TUTR,  an interactive
     tutor for the  Ada  programming language.   (See the article "THE
     VERY BEST PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE" in this issue of FidoNews,  or in
     a nearby issue.)   Individual registration for  ADA-TUTR  is only
     $25,  and a registered user receives  $5  for each individual who
     registers from one of his copies.  However,  there's an extra in-
     centive that's considerably larger than $5!

     As with some other Shareware, ADA-TUTR offers multi-user licenses
     to schools, companies, etc., priced as follows:

     FidoNews 5-33                Page 12                  15 Aug 1988


                 Number of Users:        Price of License:

                    Up to  100                 $ 450
                    Up to  500                 $ 725
                    Up to 2000                 $ 950
                    Unlimited                 $ 2400

     With  ADA-TUTR,  a registered individual receives  TEN PERCENT of
     the price of any licenses sold from his copies.  Thus, he can re-
     ceive up to  $240  per license sold!  I believe this idea is new.
     A person now has a real incentive to register  and give copies of
     the program to his employer,  to other companies, and to schools.
     (Of course, he'd also give copies to individuals, clubs, bulletin
     boards, etc., as with any Shareware.)

     The license fees are very  reasonable,  because they're not  SITE
     licenses,  but MULTI-USER licenses.   A company need buy only ONE
     license for ALL its locations,  paying according to the number of
     people who will use the program.   A license can  always  be  up-
     graded for only the difference in price.

     Since ADA-TUTR is a new program,  it's  too early to tell whether
     this idea will work.  If you'd like to see the program, a list of
     bulletin boards  that  have  ADA-TUTR.ARC  appears in the article
     "THE  VERY  BEST  PROGRAMMING  LANGUAGE."  I hope to be reporting
     here that we've found a solution to the Shareware problem!

     IFNA Issues:  My position
     Steve Bonine   115/777

     I did not receive a netmail copy of David Drexler's recent poll
     of IFNA Board of Directors candidates, but instead "happened
     upon" his message in the IFNA echomail conference.  This intro-
     duced delay into preparing my response, so I decided to submit
     it myself as a FidoNews article.  I understand that David plans
     to consolidate the responses into an article, but I don't know
     the timing and the date for FidoCon grows close.



     1. Why are you running? What do you, personally, hope to contri-
     bute to IFNA?

     I'm running because I feel that FidoNet needs an organization to
     provide certain services, and that I can help in that organiza-
     tion.  As for contributions, I bring a year of proven work on
     IFNA's behalf in providing responses mail inquiries.  I bring a
     record of a positive attitude as evidenced by my participation in
     several echomail conferences.  I bring twenty years of experience
     in the business world, both as a technician in the computer field
     and as a manager.

     Finally, I deplore the amazing amount of apathy in FidoNet today.
     Most sysops are quick to critcize (especially in echomail, which
     makes criticism so easy) and slow to do anything constructive.  I
     am not convinced that IFNA is the right answer, but it's where I
     have decided to put my personal effort to do something besides
     complain.


     2. What are your goals for IFNA? Short-term? Long-term?

     Short term, I would like to see the organization perform the
     minimum amount to be viable under its by-laws.  The current
     organization isn't even able to accomplish that.  I would expect
     IFNA to continue to perform two tasks which it has accomplished
     in the past:  Organize a convention and respond to inquires
     received by US Mail.

     By "perform the minimum amount to be viable under its by-laws" I
     mean items like announcing the nomination process for Board
     candidates in a timely manner and handling other routine items.
     Until the organization is capable of handling the most mundane
     administration of its own affairs, it has little chance of
     accomplishing anything more ambitious.

     Much of this failure is can be attributed to the small number of
     persons who actually participate in IFNA activities.  I won't
     speculate on whether this is a failure primarily on the part of
     the prospective volunteers or a failure of the current  adminis-
     tration to effectively recruit workers.

     A medium-term goal is to address public-relations issues.  IFNA
     FidoNews 5-33                Page 14                  15 Aug 1988


     currently has no organizational entity dedicated to handling its
     communications with its members or with the "outside world".  In
     a hobby which is basically communications, IFNA has a terrible
     record in communicating.

     Long term, I see IFNA serving to make FidoNet more responsive to
     the needs, desires, and opinions of the sysops which make it up.
     I have no desire to change the current structure of coordinators.
     The lack of progress on an update of Policy3 and in framing an
     echomail policy make it clear that something is missing -- an
     entity which can accomplish this type of project.  IFNA is not
     yet ready to take on that role because it does not have enough
     popular support within the network, but it is my hope that the
     day will come when IFNA will be an effective force for shaping
     the policy of FidoNet.

     3. Do you feel that the IFNA membership rules should be changed,
     and if so, how?

     Yes.  The proposed by-law amendment which comes the closest to
     reflecting my position is "D", which essentially gives a vote to
     associate members.  This proposal also allows the waiving of dues
     to anyone who contributes to IFNA, and I would like to see a
     liberal application of this option.  I don't believe that $25 is
     an unreasonable amount to pay, but I would hope that the folks
     who find that a "sticking point" would be willing to accept the
     vote based upon their (non-financial) contribution to the
     network.

     4. Should Directors be replaced if they do not fulfill all of
     their duties as specified in the By Laws? How much leeway is
     permissible?

     Absolutely.  This is an area which has caused untold harm to the
     organization.  Directors whose intent is to harm IFNA, rather
     than to help it grow, should be removed.  How to remove them is
     an important but difficult issue.  The existing recall procedure,
     which to my knowledge has never been invoked, may be adequate.

     A more significant problem is apathy.  There are too many people
     who have agreed to perform a function and have not done it, but
     who are still nominally holding the position.  I am painfully
     aware that this is a volunteer organization, but that is all the
     more reason to carefully monitor each task and be sure it is
     accomplished in a timely manner.

     If enough interested persons cannot be found to do the minimum
     amount of work to maintain the organization in a viable state,
     IFNA should be disbanded completely.

     5. Do you feel that the VP-TC should be held directly accountable
     to the BoD? (If your answer to this is "yes", what would be your
     recommended solution to the hypothetical scenario where the IC
     and RCs "hold the nodelist for ransom" to force the BoD to back
     down from a confrontation?)

     FidoNews 5-33                Page 15                  15 Aug 1988


     IFNA cannot fulfill its obligation under its by-laws to "ensure
     the smooth operation of the IFNA NETWORK as prescribed by the
     Board of Directors" [article 29] unless the IC is accountable to
     the Board.  On the other hand, at the current level of IFNA
     credibility, it would be political suicide for the Board to
     dictate to the IC.

     If the hypothetical scenario described did occur, then by my
     definition of FidoNet the Board would be in the wrong because the
     real decision-making power in the network is in the coordinator
     structure.  If such a confrontation did take place, IFNA would
     very properly be destroyed.  This seems highly unlikely, since if
     the Board had a strong consensus, the RC's would likely have the
     same consensus.

     6. Do you feel that the Statement of Position released this last
     February in St Louis contradictory to the By Laws and Articles of
     Incorporation, as some have claimed?

     No.  In fact, that Statement is a bit more ambitious than I have
     been, since it includes (in addition to maintaining the nodelist
     and sponsoring a convention) the FTSC.  IFNA must crawl before
     it can walk, and must walk before it can run.  The only way to
     walk is to first crawl, and that is what the Statement is in my
     eyes.  At this juncture, it is entirely appropriate that IFNA
     limit its activities to nodelist, FTSC, and FidoCon.

     7. How would you like to see the 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status
     used? Does it have any particular significance to IFNA? (To those
     outside of the US, this is the facility that allows people to
     make tax-deductible donations.)

     The 501(c)(3) status is absolutely key to the future health
     of the organization.  It will allow the organization to take
     advantage of corporate contributions.  I do not see an IFNA
     "rolling in money" with the advent of the tax-exempt status, but
     I do see a real opportunity to break the current 100% dependency
     on the dues structure.  More important, 501(c)(3) lends a level
     of legitimacy to an organization, and it is obvious that
     something name "FidoNet" needs all the help in that area that it
     can get.

     8. Should IFNA be in any way involved with professional telecom
     associations (like the ICA, the communications SIG of the ACM,
     etc)?

     I don't know enough about these organizations to comment.  I have
     no opposition to FidoNet's involvement with commercial ventures,
     since it provides a potential source for funds and for support in
     terms of equipment which can be used to move FidoNet traffic at
     night after being used for a commercial purpose during the day.

     9. How familiar are you with the By Laws, the Articles of
     Incorporation, and the Statement of Position?

     More familiar than I wish I was.
     FidoNews 5-33                Page 16                  15 Aug 1988


     10. Should IFNA compile and distribute nodelists for all the
     alternative nets? Please explain.

     No.  By doing so we would be attempting to interject policy into
     those nets, and they have their own policy.  We can't even handle
     our own policy yet; no additional challenges are required.

     IFNA is a FidoNet service organization.  Nets which broke away
     from FidoNet did so for a reason, and trying to "put Humpty
     Dumpty back together again" by having a common nodelist distri-
     bution mechanism won't work.

     I bear no animosity to the alternative networks, and I would like
     to see enhanced communications between them.  However, if those
     folks had wanted a common nodelist they would have stayed in
     FidoNet.

     11. What kinds of services should IFNA be providing to its
     members, and to the net, that it is not now providing? What
     enhancements to existing services would you like to see?

     Gaining credibility in the sysop world is not easy.  Sysops are
     independent folks, and "provide a service" is always dangerously
     close to "run my system".  Better communication of what IFNA is
     already doing would help.

     Acquainting the non-modem world with this hobby, and acquainting
     the modeming population with FidoNet, is a worthy goal.  A few
     well-placed articles in popular computer journals can provide
     great publicity if the structure is in place to take advantage of
     it.  Training for new sysops is another potential service area.

     Providing sysops with tangible day-to-day benefits is more
     difficult.  "Buying" the allegiance of sysops by negotiating
     deals on hardware or software is a dangerous technique.  It will
     always be difficult to convince the sysop who can't see beyond
     the computer monitor that a national organization has benefits.

     12. If someone donated a megabuck to IFNA, how would you want to
     see it spent?

     Such a donation would probably kill both IFNA and FidoNet.

     Assuming that IFNA received a moderate contribution of funds from
     one or more corporations, there are a number of projects which
     could be funded, at minimum cost, which could provide benefit to
     FidoNet.  These include a professionally-done PR package, seed
     money for FidoCon and regional FidoNet meetings, KidsNet, and
     FidoNet development in third-world countries.  This type of
     project, while not requiring massive infusion of cash, could
     enhance FidoNet's contribution to society and our enjoyment of
     our hobby as sysops.

             Hitch Hikers Guide to the Bylaws Amendments.
                  (Please read the entire article)

     1. 0001- A. NO.  It puts an untested and unused policy in the
        bylaws and in definitions.  Definitions are not for procedures
        and policy.  BAD amendment.

     2. 0002- B. NO.  Gives all sysops the "right" to vote without
        ever paying dues.  Why would anyone join?  Other problems: who
        amends bylaws.  Why give power to non members if IFNA has no
        power over them?  If you like that idea, please vote for
        0002 E!

     3. 0002- E. Called the Bacon-Jordan-Perriello Amendment.  It
        gives the organization half over to non paying sysops.  Okay,
        IF IFNA retains responsibility for FidoNet.  Otherwise, why
        bother?  NO RECOMMENDATION, but acceptable.

     4. 0004.  Sets dues within bylaws.  No recommendation,
        acceptable.

     5. 0006.  Fees.  IFNA has been poor for quite a while and with
        the number of directors we have, IFNA is not going to be sugar
        daddy.  Yes, but no affect.

     6. 0018- B. NO.  Gives seats on directors for members of
        Alternet, GoodEgg. 1. We have more than enough directors and
        nets now. 2. Why give multiple votes to a single person?

     7. 0020- A and B. Ahhh. . . this is interesting.  Proposition A
        assumes that the VP/TC has nothing to do with nodelist (not
        IC).  Proposition B clarifies old bylaws state that the VP/TC
        is IC.  Recommendation (no surprise) - B. Otherwise the VP/TC
        and IFNA do nothing.

     8. Remember if you vote for A, be consistent with other votes.

     9. Grievance committee.  Yes.  A committee can only report and
        suggest to the board.

     10.  Zones. ???  You call it.  (I do not like the idea tho'.)

     11.  Others are moderately safe and sane.



     You can vote on bylaws for IFNA.  Why should you bother?  What
     are the real issues?  You need some background and opinions.

     I got involved before and after Colorado Springs.  I wrote a
     draft set of bylaws to get things started.  And now...  I get
     ahead of the story.


     A. Background

     FidoNews 5-33                Page 25                  15 Aug 1988


     In the beginning, we had no rules.  Policy was open "Do it my way
     or leave."  There was no IFNA.  The International Coordinator(s)
     formed IFNA so that they could receive support without tax
     consequences.  The IC needed support.  It may be okay to do that
     job for 50, 200, or maybe 500.  When the list goes over 2,000
     including international nodes, it becomes far too much for one
     person to administer.

     We had a meeting in Colorado Springs.  Depending on your point of
     view, there was a revolt by some "flamers" OR the founders of
     IFNA blew it.  Both points have merit.

     After FidoCon, I decided that no one else was going to write the
     bylaws so I sat down and did a ROUGH draft!  We formed a
     committee.  EchoMail committees don't work.  We met in Nashua,
     NH.  We came up with another, different draft.  We were to go
     home to revise the rough parts.

     The BoD of IFNA put that draft to a vote against our complaints.
     The Bylaws Committee wanted to clean it up, but there was no
     final draft.  What you see today, should have been cleaned up
     before the first vote.  Why?  There are too many directors and
     ambiguities.  The procedures are terrible.  Since then I have had
     many suggestions and even final drafts of bylaws.


     Now here is the dilemma.  You have multiple amendments to
     consider.  The proposals are conflicting.  They are written by
     various people who disagree.  DO NOT APPROVE EVERY ONE!  Some
     sound better than they will taste.

     Some sysops are trying the middle ground.  Real danger!  Why?  If
     there are problems in any of FidoNet, then IFNA is supposed to
     help.  Our first response is an argument over what is our
     territory.  If FidoNet is successful, then credit goes to *Cs,
     no one joins IFNA.  No one joins IFNA -> no support for *Cs.

     If you try to please everyone by fuzzy thinking, you please no
     one.

     THE ISSUES:  Does IFNA control the FidoNet?  How much?  How?  No
     one suggests that IFNA try to enforce day-to-day control of
     FidoNet.  If IFNA does not control, can it and should it support?
     If IFNA does not control, then who does?  Is IFNA international?
     Are we an American organization that allows foreigners to join,
     but leaves them out?  How can we integrate our international
     friends?


     How does it all fit?  Please try to follow this logic.

     A. The FidoNet Sysops (FNS) need a coordinator system (*Cs) to:

          1. Maintain a nodelist with unique numbers.
          2. Process and expedite netmail.
          3. Develop standards so that net mail and echomail function.
     FidoNews 5-33                Page 26                  15 Aug 1988


          4. Make FidoNews available.
          5. Help them setting up their BBS.

     B. The *Cs need IFNA to:

         1. Raise money to support financially the FidoNet Sysops and
            the *Cs.
         2. Sanction the Technical Committee.
         3. Protect the *Cs from legal challenges.
         4. Protect the copyright of the nodelist for the benefit of
            the FNS.
         5. Interface with the world.  IFNA is a corporation and a
            legal entity and the *Cs are not.  The *Cs cannot enter
            into contracts or apply for copyrights.

     C. IFNA needs the support of the FidoNet Sysops to:

         1. Sell memberships.  No memberships -=> no money -=> no
            IFNA.
         2. Without membership, no feedback from the Sysops and IFNA
            cannot lead without feedback and legitimacy.

     D. IFNA needs the *Cs to:

         1. Operate the net by maintaining the weekly nodelist and
            adjudicating differences within the FNS and *Cs.
         2. Develop rules for operation of the net (policy).

     E. To protect and finance the *Cs (see above) and to protect the
        interest of its members, IFNA needs a strong link to the
        nodelist.  Without that link, membership shall decline and
        better leaders shall abandon IFNA.  Therefore, FULLY
        RESPECTING THE OPINIONS OF THE *Cs, IFNA shall:

         1. Elect the VP/TC.  The VP/TC shall either be the IC or
            appoint someone to be the IC.
         2. Adopt policy as recommended by the VP/TC without making
            unreasonable amendments.

     F. To protect its administrative function, the *Cs shall:

         1. Advise IFNA of their choice of VP/TC and their version of
            Policy.
         2. Retain the right to severe its relationship with IFNA.
            Severing its relationship with IFNA may have a negative
            effect upon the Sysops of the FidoNet.  Therefore, the
            *Cs shall get a vote from those sysops before any such
            separation.

     G. All the above is consistent with common sense and now accepted
        documents and require no amendments to bylaws nor policy.
        Therefore, be it resolved that:

         1. IFNA is the official organization of the FidoNet sysops.
            IFNA supports the operation of that Net.
         2. IFNA, consistent with its agreements with Tom Jennings,
     FidoNews 5-33                Page 27                  15 Aug 1988


            grants the *Cs authority and wide discretion to
            administer the FidoNet.

                    IFNA Status Report for August 1988



     General

     As will be seen below, no report was received from several areas.
     This is primarily to be blamed upon the distractions of summer,
     vacations, and high demands from other endeavors.  However, in
     one instance, the chairman of one of the committees refused to
     provide a report because, in part, he didn't want to see me
     "claim [I] and IFNA have done this or that for anybody".

     Now I will certainly admit to the fact that I find it difficult
     to separate IFNA and FidoNet in my mind because I honestly feel
     that whatever I undertake to do (regardless of results) is for
     FidoNet and IFNA is my usual vehicle for that.  I know of others
     who are trying to accomplish worthwhile ventures but have been
     denied support because it might accrue to the benefit of IFNA.
     This strikes me as petty behavior that hurts the many sysops and
     users of FidoNet more than anything else.  It is a shame on all
     of us that we still haven't learned to work together for the
     common good.



     ADMINISTRATION AND FINANCE

     This committee is still without a chairman.  We definitely need
     someone to volunteer to take on this responsibility.  Please send
     a message to 1/10 expressing your interest or talk to us about it
     at FidoCon.



     BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     Board of Director's voting reports are published in the IFNA
     EchoMail Conference and are often duplicated here.  Therefore, no
     report is provided here, however, I will indicate that although
     considerable discussion has taken place on various topics, few
     motions have occurred of late, mostly due again to summer fever
     and concentration on other matters.



     BY-LAWS AND RULES

     The head of this committee reports several problems with the
     current election.  Please see Nominations and Elections below for
     more detail.  A full report is expected from this committee at
     FidoNews 5-33                Page 29                  15 Aug 1988


     FidoCon.

     All members are requested to return their completed ballots as
     soon as possible to make sure that the August 23rd deadline for
     submittal is not missed.  Please note that the mailed ballot does
     not include the complete text of the amendments.  That may be
     found in FIDONEWS 531 or may be file requested from the nodes
     indicated in the ballot package.



     EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

     The Executive Committee is charged with administering the affairs
     of the corporation between meetings of the Board of Directors.
     Because the BoD is currently meeting in electronic session on a
     continuing basis, and because the members of this committee are
     so spread out (and also spread thin by their other duties) this
     Committee has deferred to the BoD.



     INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS

     The European nodes continue the impetus from EuroCon to work
     towards organizing on both the Regional (National) and European
     levels.



     MEMBERSHIP SERVICES

     No report was received.



     NOMINATIONS AND ELECTIONS

     The head of this committee reports several problems with the
     current election.  Although no one feels that there has been any
     conscious desire to not follow the bylaws, it appears that the
     high turnover in leadership of this committee, coupled with the
     demand of the many other responsibilities of those involved and
     some misunderstandings due to procedures in the prior year, have
     resulted in some slipped dates and the establishment of some
     procedures which are not in complete accord with our bylaws.
     This has presented us with a dilemna, as we have not been sure as
     to how best proceed, considering the mistakes that were made.

     It is our intention, based in part upon advice of our legal
     counsel, to continue the elections, and then to provide a full
     accounting of the procedures and problems involved to the
     membership and seek their directions as to future proceedings.
     A full report is expected from this committee at that time.
     This is expected to take place in an open session of the BoD at
     FidoCon.

     All members are requested to return their completed ballots as
     soon as possible to make sure that the August 23rd deadline for
     submittal is not missed.



     PUBLICATIONS

     No report was received.  However a few concerns were raised at
     EuroCon.  The European sysops, concerned with the high cost of
     international communications, would like to see FidoNews divided
     into more manageable pieces.  They are also requesting the right
     to translate the articles and redistribute the newsletter in
     their own languages.



     TECHNICAL STANDARDS

     No report was received.



     ETHICS COMMITTEE

     This committee has completed its draft of an Ethics and Conduct
     document that applies to officers, directors, and other leaders
     of IFNA.  It is expected that this document will be acted upon in
     the BoD sessions at FidoCon.



     VP-TC

     In a previous report I indicated that no report was received from
     David Dodell, but it turned out that I was in error.  My
     apologies to Dave.  The new report from the IC:

     The changeover of the Eastern Canadian Region in Zone 1 went
     smoothly.

     No changes in Region 60 (future Zone 4) South America.
     Communications are constantly plagued by poor phone lines, and
     bad connects.  Also due to the expensive costs of communicating,
     this has put a limitation on the support that can be offered long
     distance.  We are presently looking at using some other networks
     we have connections in, to keep the cost down.

     Technically, and this is a joint FTSC project, we have been
     working on updating the nodelist flags.  This is to take in
     account the tremendous changes in FidoNet technology since
     FSC-002 was issued.

     No official report was received but previous communications have
     indicated that registrations are running ahead of last year.
     However, a poor vendor response may result in some changes to
     that side of the convention.  A computer fair was being
     considered.

     I'm all set and looking forward to FidoCon!  Are you?

                    IFNA Status Report for August 1988
                              (Addendum)



     MEMBERSHIP SERVICES

     This report was received too late to make the original report.

     Considerations concerning revising the method of site selection
     for FidoCon '89 and efforts to accomplish this prior to FidoCon
     '88 proved to be unfruitful.  This process will proceed
     immediately after FidoCon as it did last year.

     The FidoCon tapes continue to be a problem area.  The tapes were
     sent to Tim Pozar for duplication.  He has yet to produce any of
     the requested copies of the tapes from prior FidoCons.  An
     attempt is being made to have them personally picked up.

     The Committee had a discussion regarding how IFNA operation might
     work more effectively based around the premise that groups work
     best when they can meet in person.  The committee feels that the
     major non-technical duties of IFNA should be handled by different
     nets each year so that they can get together at least monthly to
     talk and confront their problems and opportunities in person.  In
     short, using EchoMail for this purpose doesn't work.  The
     Cincinnati group planning FidoCon serves as the best example of
     what works well in this regard; the Membership Services Committee
     itself is an example of how EchoMail has not served us well in
     getting the job done.

     Chairman Phil Ardussi feels that it is best for the organization
     to have fresh input from new voices to continue to develop the
     full capability of the committee.  Therefore, he does not intend
     to take on this job next year.  Immediate concerns for the new
     Chairman include site selection for FidoCon '89 as well as
     responding to a list of very fine proposals from Ken Kaplan in
     the MEMSER conference.



     PUBLICATIONS

     No report was received.  However, late word did come from Tim
     Sullivan the Chairman of this committee (and also the Chairman of
     the FidoCon '88 Organizing Committee) indicating that, because of
     his other responsibilities, he was able to keep up with the
     requirements of this position.  Tim added that he strongly felt
     that the committee required more attention and therefore
     considered it necessary that he resign as Chairman.



     A FINAL WORD

     This is the last report that I will submit as President of IFNA.
     FidoNews 5-33                Page 33                  15 Aug 1988


     As I indicated at the beginning of my term, for a combination of
     reasons, I would take on this responsibility only for one year.

     In looking back over a year that has had its shares of ups and
     downs, a few points stand out:

       o  Most IFNA officials are over-worked.  There is far too much
          to be done and too few people to do it.  Mistakes and
          failures are only to be expected considering the current
          level of involvement.  FidoNet and IFNA need you INVOLVED,
          not complaining.

       o  Generally speaking, it does not work to have an individual
          attempt to handle more than one position in FidoNet.  This
          year has really proved that attempts to do this result in
          too many failures.

       o  To quite some extent, the BoD has not taken action on
          certain issues because the feeling is that there is no clear
          direction to do so by the Sysops of the Net on these issues.
          If you want more action, you must make your positions known.
          In many cases, I believe, IFNA has failed the majority of
          the Sysops in the Net because a strongly vocal minority has
          exerted more influence.  The BoD has definitely indicated
          that it has no desire but to be responsive to the wishes of
          you Sysops.  If you are not getting what you want, it
          probably is because you are not doing your job to see that
          it happens.

       o  FidoNet and IFNA need to come to terms with certain
          situations.  There is tremendous potential for maximizing
          the services FidoNet provides while minimizing the costs.
          But certain issues stand in the way of this.  You must
          decide how FidoNet and IFNA are to resolve the questions of
          needed financial support for administration and operations,
          while also addressing Sysop representation, inter-network
          interfacing, and a host of similar concerns.

       o  Confusion over international vs. local concerns is causing a
          great deal of ill feeling and misdirection throughout the
          Net.  IFNA is the INTERNATIONAL FidoNet Association; it
          should almost exclusively be concerned with policies,
          services, and other concerns that apply on a UNIVERSAL
          basis.  Support of local (i.e., Zone and all levels below)
          operations and the nitty-gritty of all local administration
          IS NOT AND SHOULD NOT be the responsibility of IFNA, per se.

          Unfortunately, the LACK of local organizations (be they
          formal or not), to handle local concerns has left a vacuum
          into which IFNA has been drawn.  There is a strong need,
          particularly within North America, for local organizations
          (at whichever levels that make sense) to form and take on
          the responsibility of local administration and service.
          These organizations and structures should form affiliations
          with IFNA which then should be limited to "umbrella"
          concerns.  [The fact that other Nets are springing up
     FidoNews 5-33                Page 34                  15 Aug 1988


          demonstrates that Sysops want and need this capability.
          A clear picture of how this should all happen does not yet
          exist, however.]

        o The present Bylaws don't work.  As it stands now, the BoD
          has the power to change the Articles of Association (the
          high-level statement of purpose of the organization) while
          the Sysops ONLY have the power to change the Bylaws (the
          rules covering day-to-day operation of the organization).
          It appears that this is the exact opposite of what is
          needed.  The Sysops should set the general direction of the
          organization by being responsible for the Articles.  The BoD
          (subject always to review and recall by the membership)
          needs the power to change the day-to-day rules to respond to
          what should be an evolution of IFNA from an organization
          trying to be all things for all people, into one that
          concentrates on just the high-level concerns.  I strongly
          urge you to vote YEA on Docket Number BLA-88-0025.

     A final point.  FidoNet ultimately will be what YOU make it.
     It makes no sense to me that anyone concerned about its future
     would not utilize to the fullest extent possible all resources
     available to shape and promote it in the form that they
     individually feel is right.  To not do so just shows a lack of
     responsibility.

     Are YOU prepared to live up to YOUR responsibility by joining and
     working together with others to see that FidoNet is and remains
     what you want it to be?


            If so, start now by answering your ballot!
