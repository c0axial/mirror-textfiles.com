                         HOW TO AVOID SYSOP BURNOUT
             By John Olson, SYSOP Third Coast Software Exchange
                                713-523-5000

     In conversations recently, I have heard at least two other sysops
     make statements to the effect that they  were  "burning  out"  on
     being  in charge of a bulletin board.  I too,  in the past,  have
     had similar feelings,  and I began to wonder  how  I  could  help
     others suffering from this affliction.

     In  my case,  the feeling has typically accompanied problems with
     the system.  For instance:  you sit in  front  of  your  machine,
     which  you  purchased  with hard earned dollars (and/or for which
     you spent countless hours developing and  maintaining  software),
     and  listen to the squeaking bearings as one of your floppies (or
     even worse,  your hard disk!) gasps its  last  breath.  You  read
     comments  to the SYSOP where someone is complaining about getting
     "read errors" on that drive.  Then the final crushing  blow;  you
     watch as a "Twit" tries to crash your security.  Its sort of like
     a half dead beetle being dragged away by ants.

     The systems I run are typically for file exchange, with little or
     no BBS facilities.  Once in a while,  someone will call up over a
     period of several days,  and download files for hours at a  time.
     They  obviously are simply going down the directory,  and have no
     purpose in mind other than to fill up disks (or  to  keep  others
     from  getting  in).  They never upload anything,  and are usually
     never heard from again.  Hey!  I accept uploads too!

     What's the solution?  In my case,  I can trace my longevity (over
     5 years as SYSOP of 5 computers) to the caring actions of maybe 3
     or  4  people.  These  are  the people who use my system and then
     reciprocate in some way.  Some of these  people  are  responsible
     for the vast majority of my uploads.  One gentlemen ALWAYS leaves
     a  short  message to say "Thanks" when he downloads a file.  (Try
     THAT sometime; you'll be amazed at the impression it makes on the
     SYSOP!) Having an assistant SYSOP and donations of equipment  are
     more direct ways to relieve the grief.

     The  point  is,  if  only  a  few  people  would express a little
     compassion for the guy that runs their favorite board,  it  could
     insure  that  it  will  be there a while longer.  The acts of one
     person (YOU!) might make the  difference.  Don't  assume  someone
     else  will do it.  There have been some very fine boards that are
     no longer around simply because of thoughtless users.

     Jim Lynn, 129/384

                                  ANSI ART


     When last we left our faithful Fido,  we had the basis for simple
     ANSI  cursor control and color changes....now,  let's do a simple
     trick that will leave 'em with their mouths open and their  chins
     in their laps...

     Imagine a plain ol' text file,  scrolling up off the screen, when
     all of a sudden, a window appears in the middle of the screen and
     "really important" information pops up.  Not too  impressed,  you
     say?  Qmodem  does  it  all  the time..  but what if the caller's
     software doesn't support windows,  and what if you are  tired  of
     people  "missing"  something  really important in the bulletin or
     welcome messages... well read on..

     Once you think about it,  there is nothing really difficult about
     faking a window on the screen of the caller. (Please refer to the
     previous  article  for  explanations  and  examples  of  the ANSI
     codes).  All we have to do is:

     1) Issue a SCP (Save Cursor Position) so that we can restore  the
        cursor to where it belongs.

     2) Send  the  cursor  to the location where we want the window to
        display.

     3) Send  the  contents  of  the  window  (complete  with   border
        characters)

     and last:

     4) Restore the cursor by sending the RCP sequence.

     You  can  also set the colors,  so that the window will REALLY be
     noticeable,  but then you are faced  with  a  decision...  Either
     reset  the  colors to the defaults (which might not be the colors
     that the caller or his/her software chose....  or just leave  the
     colors  alone,  which might be preferable if the caller's default
     colors happen to be White on Black!  If you do change the colors,
     it is worth it to make the border appear in a different color.

     Last item for the week,  if you work it just right,  you can pace
     the text so that immediately after the window appears,  the MORE?
     prompt kicks in giving you a pause.  Building on that  thought...
     why  not do a Clear Screen,  send out the "normal" text and build
     the window,  and after the MORE?  prompt (since you have a fairly
     good guess where everything is on the caller's screen) proceed to
     'erase'  the  window  by  writing  a  copy  of what was under the
     window.  This will make it appear that the window vanished,  like

     good windows should...

     The following should serve as an example.  Explanations follow...

     |+|+|
     ^[2JThis is a demonstration of a faked window.  The only
     dead giveaway is that the "window" is destructive and can
     not restore what was underneath.... but we can fake that
     also!!!!

     |+|+|

     First, save everything between (but not including) the |+|+|'s in
     a file.

     Secondly, replace the ^ symbols with ASCII 27's (ESCape sequence)
     Third  replace  the % symbols with non-printing characters (I use
     an ASCII 8 which is a backspace.) Fourth, type it from DOS.

     The lines with the %'s at the end are simply to eat up  time.  If
     it wasn't for them and the time that they take to print, then the
     window would appear, scroll, and disappear before you have a good
     chance to see them.

     In  a  nut-shell,  what we do is clear the screen so that we know
     where we are on the user's screen,  print some of the text on the
     screen,  save our position,  fake the window,  make it go away by
     printing over it with a copy of what was under it,  and lastly we
     restore the cursor position and continue to print...

     If  you  notice,  I used "plain normal" characters for the border
     characters, instead of IBM graphics....  This allows us to show a
     border  to  all the machines that do allow ANSI's but do not have
     the same high-ASCII characters as IBM.

     Next article,  we will do some things with  animation  that  will
     make Disney turn in his grave!

     Fido 106/2

                       FIDO CATALOG AUTHOR SEEKS HELP

     I am compiling a  Fido  Utility  Catalog  for  reference  by  all
     current  and new sysops.  Henk Wevers submitted a similar project
     to FidoNews  several  issues  back;  his  was  directed  more  at
     recommendations, while mine is intended as pure reference.

     The  Utility  Catalog  is  the first part of a planned Fido Files
     Reference which will include Documentation Files,  Utility Files,
     Communications Packages and possibly a selection of miscellaneous
     programs which would make up a downloadable base for new boards.

     At  this  time  I  am asking the help of Fido utility authors and
     sysops in verifying the version,  date,  author and home Fido  of
     the utilities in my listing.  In addition,  I would appreciate it
     if authors and/or sysops would forward to  me  a  description  in
     their  own  words  of  what  the  utility does.  If you have Fido
     utilities not on this list, please let me know.

     Thanks for your help.  If all goes  well,  I  will  complete  the
     Utility  Catalog  in mid-April and submit it to FidoNews.  In the
     meantime,  a reasonably current draft will be  maintained  on  my
     board (106/2, I.T.C. BBS) in the FIDO file area.

     I  must  acknowledge  the  following people for their help:  Henk
     Wevers,  whose catalog format I found much clearer  than  my  own
     original  draft;  Allen  Miller and David Reinsel,  whose utility
     libraries provided me with much of my  starting  base,  and  Kurt
     Reisler  at  Wash-A-RUG  who  sent me the utilities I needed back
     when I was still getting this board on its feet.

                               MODIFYING FIDO
                                     or
                   Some times the only way to get it done
                           is to do it yourself.


          I have seen more  than  a  few  "wish  lists"  in  FidoNews,
     directed to Saint TJ,  asking for changes to Fido.  I,  too, have
     written that mystical person, requesting some simple mods.

          Don't get me wrong! I do understand that TJ is not only tied
     up with a full time job,  but he is also busy with  some  of  the
     more important Fido jobs,  like making POLLing work.  He probably
     just doesn't have time to tweak and tune Fido to suit the rest of
     us.

          Like most sysops,  I get tired of asking callers to  conform
     to the arrangement of my board.  As a friend who is the president
     of software publishing firm once said,  "people want well-written
     documentation,  but no one wants to read it!" Analogously,  on  a
     bulletin  board,  people want multiple message areas,  but no one
     wants to leave his messages in the appropriate message bases.  My
     wish list to TJ included adding the facility to  Fido  such  that
     some  message areas could be configured to be private-only,  some
     mixed, and some to be public-only.

          As the title suggests,  I  did  it  myself.  With  a  little
     effort,  using  Phoenix  Software's Pfix-Plus (hooray for TJ - at
     least he gives us the tools!),  I traced down the section of code
     that asks the user whether a message is to be private.  With some
     minor  patching,  I  was  able to make message areas zero and one
     always private.

          Here is the code for these changes in Fido Ver. 11q.

     ===( PRIVAREA.BAT )==============================================

     ren fido_ibm.exe f.x
     debug f.x < privarea.pat
     ren f.x fido_ibm.exe

     ===( PRIVAREA.PAT )==============================================

     ea2ce
     83 3E 1B 51 01 7e 1c
     w
     q

     =================================================================

          As new versions of  Fido  reach  me,  I  will  update  these
     patches, and make them available on Remark - Fido 147/0.

     Luck Hurder
     Cape Cod Fido 101/105

                     FIDOGRAMS - YOUR LINK TO EVERYONE!

     It's been several months since an article about the FidoGram free
     telegram service has appeared in  FidoNews.  That,  coupled  with
     the  fact  that  the telegram rush of the holiday season has long
     since gone by, makes me feel that it's time to review some of the
     pertinent features of the service,  and how you can make it  work
     best for you.

     First,  for those of you new to FidoNet,  the FidoGram service is
     brought to you as a free  public  service  by  the  thousands  of
     Amateur  Radio  operators across the country who participate in a
     network called the National Traffic System.  The purpose  of  NTS
     is to provide the public with a free communications service which
     also  serves  to  exercise  our  skills  and equipment on a daily
     basis.  This exercising is necessary to insure our readiness  for
     times  of  emergency  when normal communications lines are either
     severely loaded or non-existant,  such as during the Mexico  City
     disaster.  To put it in perspective - we NEED your FidoGrams...

     What  type  of  messages  can  you  reasonably expect to send via
     FidoGram?  Any  non-business,  personal  message  that  does  not
     result  in  a profit for any party,  and which is not contrary to
     the laws of decency.  You should be  aware  that  youngsters  and
     little  ole  ladies are equally likely to be responsible for get-
     ting your FidoGrams to their ultimate destinations.

     FidoGrams should be kept short.  That's simple enough to do -just
     pretend that you were asking  my  employer  (RCA)  to  send  your
     FidoGram to a ship at sea at the standard $.67 per word!  If your
     FidoGrams  get lengthy,  we will just break them up into multiple
     messages,  but 15 words seems about right.  Stay clear of numeric
     data  such  as "call me at 300/1200/2400 baud using X.25 protocol
     at 9:30 PM" or messages of this nature - it is often confusing to
     the relay stations (usually human) and may get garbled along  the
     way.

     Finally,  how do you actually send free FidoGrams?  That, too, is
     simple.  Just send the following info  to  Luck  Hurder  at  Fido
     101/105, either direct at (617) 255-9465, or by FidoMail.  Unlike
     MANY  nodes  we've  run across at much expense,  Cape Cod Fido IS
     available at the proper national mail time slot:

     1. The SENDER'S complete  name,  address  and  telephone  number.
        (The  Fido  net and node is NOT sufficient.  If we need to get
        back to you with a response or a question,  we don't  wish  to
        spend  money  on  FidoMail,  when  we  can send it for free by
        Amateur Radio!)

     2. The  complete  name,  address  and  telephone  number  of  the
        recipients of your FidoGrams.

     3. The text of your messages.
     Fidonews                     Page 11                  14 Apr 1986


     4. A signature.

     You  can  send 20 FidoGrams in one piece of FidoMail if you like;
     there's no limit to the number that you can send at once or as  a
     total.

     If  you  need further information on FidoGrams,  I recommend that
     you scan your local node for the FIDOGRAM.ARC file, which,  among
     other  things,  gives  you  the list of countries that allow free
     FidoGrams across their borders.  If FIDOGRAM.ARC is not available
     locally,  don't hesitate to call Cape Cod Fido  and  download  it
     from the 4th file area - Fidfile.

     Feel  free  to  use  and  enjoy  FidoGrams  as often as you like.
     Input,  both good and bad,  regarding the service is always  most
     welcome.

     Mike Ringer, 117/1262

                         One of those Crazy Nuts


     I would like to  compliment  the  fellow  that  wrote  the  first
     article  in  FidoNews  312.  It just happened to follow the exact
     problems I'm having at Elite Software.  It seems that  some  bozo
     has been hacking at the sysop password and messed with my system.
     Oh well I guess immature people will be that way.  Another one of
     my  problems  is  with  11  year old users.  One of them has been
     talked to by his father and the other?  Well there isn't  much  I
     can do about him.

     For  those of you who have been wondering,  I have finally bought
     my own computer!  I got a Panasonic Exec.  Partner a couple weeks
     ago,  its a great machine, even the built in printer is nice.  It
     uses both regular bond and thermal paper.  I can  switch  between
     4.77  MHz clock freq and a 7.16 MHz freq clock.  The machine also
     lets me switch to an external printer.  My only gripe is I  can't
     find a way to turn off the stupid speaker.

     Ok  I  know  I've  seen it somewhere in FidoNews but I'm not sure
     where.  Is PANGO.EXE pirated or not?  I won't  put  it  out  till
     somebody tells me it is or isn't.

     Is  there  anybody  out  there  that is interested in starting up
     another one of the disk swaps?  I'd like to do one before I leave
     College Station.  I'm interested mainly in one in Texas, but If I
     have to go out side of Texas it's ok.

     Once again things have seemed to come  back  to  the  pay/no  pay
     situation.  I'm  not really sure where I stand on the problem.  I
     barely have enough time to run Fido,  and if it wasn't for  Elite
     Software giving me the machine, modem and 30 meg hd I don't think
     it  would  be possible to run the system.  My system used to be a
     situation where you had to be validated, but I'm just plain tired
     of having to go through and validate everyone so I opened it  up.
     Well  this  caused  problems,(no  doubt),  every hacker and there
     mother's dog felt they had to call the system so since  I  opened
     the system I've had 5 break-ins and two of them where in the same
     week.  I ignored the first three and filed reports about the last
     two.  And  one  of  the  local newspapers picked up on the report
     before the police talked to me, and that was about a week ago and
     I still haven't talked to the Bryan Pd about it yet!  Oh  well  I
     guess  there  to  busy trying to catch all of the locals speeding
     through  school  zones  or  something.  Someday  I'll  get  there
     attention but I'm not sure how.

     Stu Turk, 129/17

                           Should BBS's be Free?


         This is in reply to Fred Berger's Editorial in FidoNews v.312
     about the growing number of BB's  that  are  starting  to  charge
     either a membership or a registration fee, sometimes a "one time"
     charge,  other times a "per year" fee.  The fees do bring in some
     extra money to cover operating expense and also help maintain the
     system by cutting down on the number of Users -and that's the bad
     part.

         Berger pointed out that he got quick answers to questions  on
     the  pay  board  he subscribes to,  and almost no response on the
     free board.  My experience is a  little  different;  I've  always
     received responses to questions I've posted on local free boards.
     But  the  reason  Berger is more likely to receive a reply on the
     pay boards is because that board's Users are more  likely  to  be
     dedicated  computerists while the freebee's user list may be made
     up of a larger number of hobbyists with minimal  experience,  and
     young people.  They may not know enough to reply to anything, but
     they   are  lurking  there  reading  replies  to  other  people's
     questions and  learning.  And  they  are  the  people  who  might
     benefit  most  from  the  information  being exchanged on the pay
     boards;  boards that they will not subscribe to because  they  do
     not know what they are missing.

         The  small  subscription/registration  fee  itself  isn't the
     problem. But consider this: how many boards do you use regularly?
     If each charged only $5 or $10 how much would the total be if you
     kept using all of them?  How  about  the  boards  you  call  long
     distance  once a month or so,  just to see what's new.  Would you
     keep calling all of them if you had  to  pay  each  one?  Do  you
     think  all  users can afford to subscribe to all boards?  I don't
     think so.  You  may  remember  TJ  said  "..not  all  users  have
     IBM's.." I'll add to that: Not all users are rich!  Some are just
     people who like to read messages.

         And there are the young users.  Kids who  may  not  have  the
     money or any way to send it in if they had it or any knowledge of
     why  they  should send it.  Yes,  kids are a problem;  they often
     don't know what they are doing and they leave silly  messages.  A
     sysop in my net remarked recently "...I see no reason I should be
     a  nursemaid  to  other people's children who haven't been raised
     properly." I can't disagree with him.  But those kids will learn,
     will grow up,  and will buy "real" computers.  And in time,  they
     will be the ones answering the questions.

         When  my  bulletin  board goes up a month or so from now,  it
     will be free.  Yes, I will ask for donations.  And,  no,  I won't
     get any.  My board will be aimed at the handicapped user who,  as
     a group,  is more likely to be underemployed and I don't want  to
     do  anything  that  might  discourage them from using it.  If you
     feel you must charge a fee,  so be it.  But part of your  out  of
     pocket  operating  expense  is the telephone expense you incurred

     while getting files for your  users  to  download.  Your  message
     area cost you nothing.  Instead of a subscription or registration
     fee, how about just charging for downloading privileges AND LEAVE
     THE  MESSAGE  AREA  OPEN  TO  EVERYONE.  So  information  can  be
     exchanged and others can learn.

     Chris Irwin, 108/68

                 Creating the political WILL to end hunger.


     RESULTS FidoNet is an experiment in public communication  by  the
     Cincinnati RESULTS group.  We hope that it will become a national
     center  for  collecting and distributing hunger-related articles.
     We HAVE the technology and resources to end starvation by the end
     of the century.  We MUST create and sustain the political will to
     accomplish this goal.

     RESULTS  is  a  grass-roots  citizen's  lobby  dedicated  to  the
     knowledge  that  EACH ONE of us can make a difference.  Against a
     background of silent indifference,  those of us who speak out can
     make a profound impact.  If we look around,  we see that very few
     of the people we know spend any  time  communicating  with  their
     representatives  about  their  concerns.  RESULTS members educate
     themselves so that they can write to  Senators,  Congressmen  and
     editorial  writers  about  key  issues.  RESULTS  is  a  national
     organization with 57 groups in 33 states.

     The purpose of RESULTS FidoNet is twofold:

     1) To  allow  the  efforts  of  different   hunger   groups   and
        organizations  to  be  combined in a public forum of articles,
        information and conferencing.

     2) To educate the members of the electronic community  about  the
        problems  facing  developing countries and what we as citizens
        can and must do about it.

     The system has only been up since 3/12,  so we haven't  collected
     many  articles  yet.  We  would like to encourage other sysops to
     redistribute any articles that are of interest so that more users
     will be informed.  Uploads would be greatly appreciated  so  that
     we may expand our libraries.

                              "Each of the great social achievements
       ---------------         of recent decades has come about not
       RESULTS FidoNet         because of government proclamations
       ---------------         but because people organized, made
                               demands and made it good politics for
       (513) 531-4654          governments to respond.  It is the
     300/1200/2400 Baud        political will of the people that
                               makes and sustains the political will
       "Creating the           of governments."
        political WILL
        to end hunger."        James Grant, Executive Director UNICEF

                             Notes from Abroad


     I feel like I'm shouting at a brick wall!  I wonder can you  tell
     why?  I  have  heard  rumors  that  the  Fido software contains a
     network system.  This network  system  is  for  sending  messages
     remotely  from  one  FidoNode to another.  I have been online for
     about nine months now,  I run 24 hours a day,  seven days a week.
     I am also the only Fido node in Europe that is running two Fido's
     concurrently.  Do  you  know  how  many  FidoNet  messages I have
     received in the last 9 months? 200? 100?  50?  No!  At last count
     I have received the staggering total of FIVE !!!!!!!

     Admittedly  this  is more than I have sent out,  but it's still a
     pretty bad figure.

     As far as I can tell I am the record holder for FidoNet  messages
     in  the  UK.  Why  does  no one send mail to the UK?  Does anyone
     send mail at all?  We have had problems with mail in the  UK  but
     we can all receive mail.  There are more Fido's in the UK than in
     any other country in Europe.

     I  would  dearly  love  to  know  if I can contact anyone else in
     Europe  with  my  USR  modem,   particularly  the  other  country
     coordinators.  I  hear  that  some  of  you  have "Bell Annexes".
     Could I have the details of these please?


     OK that's about it,  I hope that we get some response in  the  UK
     from  this.  I  will be polling the UK nodes for mail from now on
     so I hope to get the mail moving internally.

     Mike Miller, Orlando Florida

                  The Great Brown Bag Word Processor Hoax


     The April 15 issue of PC Magazine has a free disk  enclosed  -  a
     full  working  copy of the Brown Bag Word Processing program with
     Mail Merge. Wow!  What a great idea and what a great magazine!

     But  what's  this  - there's something about "Unlocking" the copy
     protected disk for $85 - If I don't,  it's going to suddenly stop
     working  after a while.  I couldn't resist the temptation to test
     their copy protection - sure enough,  even the latest versions of
     COPYIIPC and COPYWRIT admit defeat in trying to make a copy.

     By  this  time  I'm  thinking  that  this  program must really be
     something special - mass marketing it to everyone  in  the  world
     who  buys  PC  Magazine  and  incorporating  the very latest copy
     protection methods.  I'd better try this program out - maybe it's
     really worth it to unlock it for $85.

     I do a disk directory and recognize some familiar looking files -
     ED.EXE,  HELPE.DEF,  RULER.DEF,  etc.  I think, "this must be the
     wrong disk in the drive,  because those are PC-WRITE files." Nope
     -  it's  the Brown Bag Word Processor alright.  This can't be!  I
     crank the program up and with the exception  of  an  introduction
     screen identifying it as the Brown Bag Word Processor - it is PC-
     WRITE v2.55 - licensed by the author,  Bob Wallace, to Brown Disk
     Manufacturing, Inc.  What will they think of next?

     So - you get to try out this Brown Bag "mystery" program  for  an
     unspecified  length of time,  and just as you're starting to like
     it,  it dies.  You send off your $85 to get it fixed  and  you're
     happy  again.  But  of  course,  you have to put up with the copy
     protection nonsense in the meantime.

     Wait! I have a great idea!  Why not get a legal SHAREWARE copy of
     PC-WRITE v2.55 (if  you  are  one  of  the  .0001  %  of  the  PC
     population  that doesn't already have a copy),  try it out for as
     long as you wish,  and then register if you choose to do  so.  No
     copy  protection,  no  "rigged" program that dies just as you are
     getting  used  to  it,   but  the  same  program  with  the  same
     capabilities.

     What do I think of this particular offer?  (I'll  bet  you  can't
     guess).  Well,  I think PC Magazine is an excellent magazine, the
     idea of putting a trial or demo disk in the magazine  is  a  good
     one,  and  PC-WRITE  is  a  very  good  editor (I am a registered
     owner).  BUT - putting a copy protected, boobytrapped,  identical
     clone of a readily available SHAREWARE program in a magazine with
     no  reference  to the fact that it really is just another program
     in disguise - well,  that stinks!  They'll probably make a ton of
     money from all of the people who don't know any better - and that
     makes it smell even worse!

              Now available from Micro Consulting Associates!!

     Public Domain collection - 300+  "ARC"  archives  -  10  megs  of
     software  and  other  goodies,  and that's "archived" size!  When
     unpacked,  you get approximately 17 megabytes worth of all  kinds
     of  software,  from text editors to games to unprotection schemes
     to communications programs, compilers, interpreters, etc...

     This collection is the result of more than 10 months of intensive
     downloads from just about 100 or more BBS's  and  other  sources,
     all  of  which have been examined,  indexed and archived for your
     convenience.  Starting a Bulletin Board System?  Want to  add  on
     to your software base without spending thousands of dollars? This
     is the answer!!!

     To  order  the  library,  send  $100  (personal or company check,
     postal money order or company purchase order) to:

                    Micro Consulting Associates, Fido 103/511

     Please allow 3 weeks for delivery of your order.

     Note:  No profit is made from  the  sale  of  the  Public  Domain
     software  in  this  collection.  The price is applied entirely to
     the cost of  downloading  the  software  over  the  phone  lines,
     running  a  BBS  to  receive  file  submissions,  and inspecting,
     cataloguing, archiving and maintaining the files.  Obtaining this
     software  yourself  through  the  use  of a computer with a modem
     using commercial phone access would cost you much more than  what
     we charge for the service...

     Please specify what type of format you would like the disks to be
     prepared on.  The following choices are available:

             IBM PC-DOS Backup utility

             Fastback
             Plain  ol' files (add $50,  though,  it's a lot  of
             work and takes more diskettes...)

     Add  $30  if  you  want  the  library  on  1.2 meg AT disks (more
     expensive disks).  There are no  shipping  or  handling  charges.
     California residents add 6% tax.

     For each sale, $10 will go to the FidoNet Administrators.

                               European Time

     It's all very simple,  really.  The clock moves one hour further.
     So it looks like it's an hour later.  But it is one hour earlier.
     Because  we  subtract  one hour in the evening and so it's longer
     light.  But then again,  we add that in the morning so it will be
     dark  longer.  But not in the UK,  they keep their own time.  Ah,
     well,  what is time anyway.  I hope all of you in europe made the
     time  change in the right direction.  Fido sysops measure time by
     the mailslot, don't they?
