       ============================================================

       This week's guest editorial is by Bdale Garbee, Fido 129/13.


                          Fido for the Deaf/Blind


       Last week's issue of Fidonews contains  an  article  from  a
       user of my board who is legally blind,  and deaf as well.  I
       think the subject of his article is worthy  of  considerable
       thought, and I hope everyone will take the time to both read
       it and try what it suggests.  Let me try and explain why...

       There  has been a fair amount of public chatter lately about
       why an individual would want to be a Fido sysop.  There  was
       even an editorial on the subject not long back.  I do what I
       do  to  serve  as  my  contribution to the grass-roots space
       movement.  But in addition,  the public nature of my  system
       has resulted in a fairly large user base,  some of whom have
       come almost to depend on the services provided.

       The most obvious example of what I mean  is  Stu  Turk,  the
       gentleman  who  wrote  the  article last week.  He has found
       Fido  and  Fidomail  a  far  superior  replacement  for  the
       communications  channels  usually  available  to people with
       hearing and/or sight impairments.

       Stu suggests in his article that we as sysops and  users  of
       Fido  could  do an awful lot of good by helping to introduce
       deaf and blind people to our systems,  to Fidomail,  and  to
       the  amateur radio Telegram service accessible via Fido.  We
       know how powerful  these  communications  channels  are  for
       us... think what they could mean to someone for whom many of
       the traditional communications channels are worthless!

       What's the incentive?  If you really need one,  consider the
       following...

       The  possibility  of  Fido/Fidonet   becoming   a   regular,
       dependable  part  of  the  daily  communications between D/B
       people could be a way for Fido,  and other BBS's,  to become
       somewhat more respectable.  We would actually be providing a
       real, public service to the handicapped.  Imagine what would
       happen if Congress or state governments then tried to impose
       restrictions  on  the  use of BBS's and modems!  If we could
       turn the tables in such a way that they were seen as  taking
       away a valuable service from the handicapped....  how far do
       you think they'd get?  Public opinion can be a VERY powerful
       tool.  Enough said on the subject.

       Even if we aren't worried about all that....  it just  gives
       me  a  good  feeling to know that my system is being used by
       someone to do something they otherwise couldn't  do,  or  at
       least  couldn't  do as well.  I think other sysops might end
       up feeling the same way.  Give it a try!

       John Plocher
       Fido 121/90

               A Request to Writers of Online Documentation

        This  is a response to the request for newsletter  feedback
       about  the FidoNewsLetter layout.  I just spent my last  few
       timeslices downloading and printing the FidoNewsLetters from
       2-18  to  2-42.  Up to about 2-26 or so,  I could say  PRINT
       FIDOxxx.NWS and ignore the thing as it printed.  But, then I
       noticed that the header didn't always get printed on the top
       of the paper!  That got me thinking (a dangerous thing to do
       ANYTIME!)  about  what  Bdale  said  in  his  article  about
       document standards.

        Why  does  FidoNews (or for that matter,  any of  the  Fido
       manuals) have to be sent out in a "print image" format?  The
       problems of doing things that way are numerous:

        1) If your printer does things differently from the way the
           file  is set up for (8 lpi instead of  6lpi,  compressed
           print...)  you  have to hand edit the file  to  make  it
           work.

        2) If  you  never print the thing,  but only TYPE them  out
           while online,  you have to wade through the page  breaks
           without losing those last few lines which seem to scroll
           off the top before you can read them...

        3) In the current incarnation of the text formatter used to
           produce FidoNews (I assume its TEXTFORM?) every line has
           8  to  10 spaces pre-pended to it.  This INCLUDES  BLANK
           LINES!  Indenting  like that seems to be a great way  to
           make  a 600 line (10 page)  newsletter 5K to  6K  LARGER
           than  it really should be!   Could that be why ARC seems
           to shrink the file OVER 50%?

        Instead of just complaining,  I offer this  solution:  Send
       FidoNews  out  in  an  unprocessed  format.  (ie.  with  .pa
       commands for page breaks, and a .he FidoNews Vol x Number xx
       Page # command to set up the header.

        That  way  anyone with WordStar  (shudder),  Tom  Jenning's
       TEXTFORM,   or  any  of  the  nroff  type  formatters  which
       recognize the .he and .pa commands can print it out on their
       own printer, and those who only want to read the thing while
       online don't have to see the blank pages scroll by.

        The programs:
        TEXTFORM       Tom Jenning's print formatter, -and-
        PRINTWS        My version thereof including ^char support
        can both be downloaded from Fido 121/90, MidNet.

       PS. Before I decided to print out the FidoNewsLetters, I had


       Fidonews                   Page  4               23 Dec 1985





           been  using FGREP to search for articles which I  wanted
           to refer to. I'm sure that I'm not the only one who does
           this sort of thing, so thus the following PLEA:

               At  the beginning of an article,  include a line  or
               two  or three labled with Keywords:  and  containing
               words which describe what the article is  about.  If
               you  are replying to someone's article,  use some of
               his/her keywords, also, so your article will show up
               in the list with the one it references.

           Things  like  that would make it feasable  to  implement
           some sort of index generator to produce a subject  index
           for  the newsletter.  Sound useful?  Let me know how you
           feel!  (I took the chance and stuck my neck out in  this
           FidoNewsLetter; so can you!)

                                   TROFF
                        by  Rich Gough  Fido 129/13

       (I  wrote  this  story 3 years ago for the  Pittsburgh  Area
       Computer  Club newsletter to spoof the movie "TRON",  but it
       still seems  apropriate.  Send me some fido mail if you have
       comments about it.)

            On cold winter evenings,  I spend a lot of time sitting
       at  my home computer.   Last night  however,   very  strange
       things  started happening while I was loading the  operating
       system.    I meant to  type  "LOAD  CPM",   but I goofed and
       put "LOAD MCP"  instead.     Suddenly,   my  fingers started
       to disintegrate,   then my  hands and my arms.   I was being
       sucked through the CRT piece by piece!

            I   woke   up in a  strange  universe  where   personal
       computers are  computers that own people,   while  corporate
       computers    actually  run  huge  corporations (instead   of
       only  seeming to as they  do here).    I  found myself at  a
       computer club meeting,   which is where a bunch of computers
       get   together  to  nibble  on sugar-coated   diskettes  and
       gripe  about the  people they own.    The people  they bring
       with  them to the meeting  usually just   sit   on  a  table
       and  hum   to themselves.

            Apparently,  different  types  of  personal   computers
       prefer different  kinds of people.    (The computers usually
       call  their   particular person their  "user".)   A    small
       video  game  system   angrily pointed a joystick at his user
       and said,  "This  jerk  wants me  to  run  Accounts  Payable
       and  then complains  about  how slow I am!   I've only got 8
       bits.  What should  I  have expected for  a  measely hundred
       bucks!   I  should have  gotten some  teenage  kid who would
       let   me   do what  I do best - shoot down   spaceships  and
       munch dots."

            "You  think you've  got  problems",  moaned  a powerful
       16-bit   system.     "My  user   has  one  dumb  spreadsheet
       package,  and  that's  all he runs!   I wish he'd  get  some
       interesting  software,    something that  would use me to my
       full  potential.   Maybe  some business graphics once in   a
       while to keep me in shape."

            "At least your user gives you something  to do once  in
       a  while",  said  a dusty  system as he brushed the  cobwebs
       from his keyboard.   "My user and I don't communicate.    He
       wouldn't  know  a  Move Register  instruction if I  hit  him
       over  the head with it.   I even bought a BASIC  interpreter
       for him,  but he won't bother to learn how to use it.   If I
       don't  get  a break to the boredom soon,   sometime I  think
       I'm just going to pull my  plug."  He  choked  "I'd even  do
       biorhythms  for him."

            "What   are  biorhythms?"  asked  one  of  the   newest
       machines.   An  old  Altair  in a grey     metal     cabinet
       spoke     up.   "Biorhythms    were   charts    that    were
       supposed   to  tell when your user  would operate   at  peak


       Fidonews                   Page  6               23 Dec 1985





       efficiency,   but  they were never very accurate.   What you
       need  for that is a special-purpose diagnostic user--they're
       called psychiatrists."

            The   game  system  who  had  spoken  first  said,   "I
       guess  the  problem is,  we just  didn't  think  about  what
       kind  of user  we wanted before we each went  out and bought
       one."

            The   16  bit  system  said,    "The problem  is,    we
       just  didn't   think, period."

            The  dusty system said,  "Didn't we buy users to do the
       thinking for us?"

            I  was  about to speak up and add  my two bytes  worth,
       when I heard a terrible crash  and the lights went out.    I
       woke  up  sitting at my computer and  the  CRT  screen  said
       "MEMORY  SIZE",   meaning that its'  memory had been erased.
       I  could hear  the refrigerator running - it must have   cut
       on  and  dropped  the   line voltage.    It was late,  and I
       had to get up early for work the next morning,  so I  turned
       the  system   off.    Next   weekend (after  I   unplug  the
       refrigerator)  I'm going to try to load that diskette  again
       and tell those computers what it is like to  be a user.   If
       I  don't  come  back,  well,   I  wanted all of you to  know
       what happened.

       As a user of an ITT Xtra PC I am trying to start a nation-
       wide users group via FidoNet.  Currently there are two
       fido's involved. Fido 107/311 the XTRA BBS located in
       Clifton, NJ and Fido 114/446 Xtra #1 located in Arizona.
       These two Fido's will serve as the east and west region
       headquarters for information on the ITT Xtra PC.  We are
       asking all owners and users of ITT Xtras to contact either
       of these Fido's via FidoNet with the following information:

              1. Name and net/node#
              2. Configuration of ITT equipment (#drives,RAM,etc)
              3. Address ( for fortcoming newsletter)
              4. Comments and suggestions on the user's group
                 goals and objectives.

       We will be compiling a list of hardware and software that
       functions with and without patches for the ITT Xtra as well
       as providing technical reviews, findings and information
       about upcoming products.  Employees of ITT and its many
       various divisions are especially welcome (please note
       this in your introductory information).

                  Software Piracy -- A Personal Opinion

           Software  piracy  has  been  around  for what seems like
       forever.  Since  the  beginning  of  software,  people  have
       copied  friends'  software,  and thought nothing of it.  I'm
       writing  this  because  I  feel  that  people  SHOULD  think
       something  of  it, and we should start telling people not to
       copy software.

           Don't walk away from your monitor  thinking,  "Oh,  boy.
       Here   comes   another   lecture  on  how  to  use  software
       correctly."  My reason for writing is just  as  a  concerned
       user,  not as a commercial programmer, not as a person whose
       income depends on advertisements  from  software  companies,
       and  not  as a relative or friend of someone who wants me to
       write it.  I see people copying disks all of the time, and I
       think that it's time that we took a stand.

           The first users of  computers  were,  as  we  know,  the
       hackers.   These  hackers, as detailed in Steven Levy's book
       "Hackers," (an  excellent  book,  by  the  way),  felt  that
       programs  should  be  shared  between  fellow hackers.  When
       commercial software came out, the  authors  did  not  follow
       this  code  of  conduct,  but instead, told people that they
       must buy their own copy of a program if they want to use it.

           Over  the  years,  more  and more people have started to
       copy software.  Today, most people  who  buy  software  will
       willingly  make  a  copy  of  it  for  a  friend  who  seems
       interested.  No longer is it just the people who write  copy
       programs who pirate; everyone else can have the programs for
       -- what else?  -- a copy.

           Before  I  outline several of the methods that have been
       used to deter pirating, let me just make one thing clear, in
       case my opinion hasn't  been  understood  yet:  Pirating  is
       STEALING.   Yes, stealing.  Pirating software is the same as
       Xeroxing a book for a friend who wants it.  If  I  gave  out
       free  copies  of  an  Isaac  Asimov  book,  wouldn't that be
       illegal?  The same with software -- except that it costs the
       disk space and nothing more.

           The first method, and by far the most common, is that of
       copy "protection."  For those of you  who  might  not  know,
       this  usually  involves changing the disk format so that the
       computer can read from the disk, but  cannot  write  to  it.
       There are different levels of copy protection -- some can be
       copied  file-by-file but not a disk at a time, while on some
       others, you can't even get a directory.

           Copy  protection,  in my opinion, is wrong.  Period.  It
       just adds a little to the cost of the software (although  it
       costs  no  more  to  mass-copy disks, the company has to pay
       another company to protect them), is usually (if not always)
       broken into and copied and distributed, and makes it  harder
       for us regular people to make back-ups.

           Several  software  companies  have now started including


       Fidonews                   Page  9               23 Dec 1985





       two or three copies of the software with the package.  A few
       other companies, in order to get people  to  send  in  their
       warranties,  give them the additional copies only after they
       have registered as users of the software.  This  helps,  but
       is not perfect.

           Why, you may ask, am I so much against copy  protection?
       I'll  tell you -- I'm a real klutz, and on several occasions
       I've done different things to destroy disks.  Granted,  they
       weren't  my  originals,  and  the greater percentage of them
       were programs that could be re-written easily, but  had  the
       software  been  copy-protected, I would have been out $50 or
       $100.  I'd rather make a back-up copy or two, and use  that.
       In the event that I accidentally erase my disk, I don't want
       to  have to either pay or waste two weeks of my time just to
       get another copy.

           A few companies, such  as  Microsoft,  let  you  make  a
       limited  number of copies.  This is better, but has the same
       drawbacks as giving you two or three copies -- what  if  you
       lunch  all  of  them?   And still other companies use a "key
       disk," which means that you can copy their software to  your
       heart's content, so long as you have the original disk in at
       the  beginning.   That's  just  as bad a regular protection.
       What if the original gets ruined?  You can't use the copies,
       since  they're  useless  without  the   original.    Borland
       International  (see  later  on  about  them)  marketed their
       SideKick program with this kind  of  protection.   Within  a
       month,  so  many  letters of complaint had arrived that they
       offered a higher-priced version, with no protection.  That's
       very fair, and showed that they are a company  that  listens
       to its users.

           The  second most-common way of protecting software is by
       using a hardware key.  I've used these on several occasions,
       and although I prefer them to software protection, I  detest
       having  to put this little thingy into my computer each time
       I want to use the program.   I  work  on  several  different
       computers,  and  when  I  want  to  take a program back from
       school to work on at home, I don't  want  to  have  to  plug
       something  into  the  game  port,  or  carry around an extra
       expansion card.

           I'll  admit  that  this  is  much  better   than   plain
       copy-protection  on many grounds.  First and formost, I like
       being able to make back-ups of the software, so  that  if  I
       trash  a disk, I can always make another back-up.  Secondly,
       it lets me roam free  with  my  software,  only  carrying  a
       little thing, rather than the original diskette (but I still
       like back-ups; see above).

           Unfortunately,  there  are  many more disadvantages than
       advantages with hardware protection.  As I  said  before,  I
       would  rather  carry a hardware key with me than an original
       disk, but who wants to carry it,  and  what  if  it  breaks?
       Also -- if my friend wants to see the software (NOT copy it,
       just  see  it),  and  I  go over to his house or bring it to
       school, knowing me, I'll forget the key.

           The third method to deter pirating,  and  the  only  one
       which  I  endorse,  is low prices and no protection.  That's
       it.  I personally  refuse  to  pay  more  than  $100  for  a
       program,  or  for  one  that  is protected in any way.  Many
       companies have started endorsing this policy, and it  works.
       Two  companies  from whom I've bought software, Beagle Bros.
       (for the Apple II's that I use), and  Borland  International
       (I  bought Turbo Pascal from them) are examples of companies
       that have not  done  just  well,  but  EXTREMELY  well  from
       selling low-cost software with no protection.

           People,  in  general, don't like to be policed, and when
       given the choice, probably go for no protection.  Using  the
       example  I  used  before,  I  have  no  doubt  that sales of
       unprotected SideKick outnumber protected sales by 10 to one.
       As for companies like Lotus and Microsoft, well, I just hope
       that one day they lower their prices.  Microsoft has already
       started unprotecting Access and  Chart,  and  in  due  time,
       Lotus will probably do the same with some of their products.
       The  reason  that  they  can keep doing that is because it's
       mainly huge corporations who buy their products, and to them
       $600 is pennies.

           I'd  just  like  to say two more things before you go on
       with your reading.  Firstly, we have to think of  the  other
       side  of  the  coin,  the  software  company.  I'm sure some
       employee of a software firm is reading this and saying  that
       what  I said is unfair.  Well, I do understand that there is
       a lot of time and expense put into any  piece  of  software,
       and most companies are just trying to get their money back.

           My argument on that point is that any software publisher
       who  puts  out  a  product  at, let's say, $100, will get at
       least as many customers as at, say, $600.  The companies who
       would buy it at the higher  price  will  probably  buy  more
       copies  for  their  use, and the small business and home use
       will get it because it does a good job for a great price.

           Secondly, I'm not alone.  I don't know any other  people
       personally  who agree with my philosophy, but I do know that
       several  major  software  firms  have  started  taking   off
       protection.    MicroPro,   makers   of  WordStar,  protected
       WordStar 2000 for the first month or so, and because  of  so
       many  letters  of  complaint, unprotected it.  Microsoft has
       now taken the protection off  of  their  Chart  and  Project
       software.    Scarborough   Systems,   Inc.    is  no  longer
       protecting its IBM versions of software.

           To finish up, I believe in the 3P software philosophy --
       Priced under $100, no Protection, and no  Piracy.   I  think
       that  if  everyone  in the computer industry bought software
       according to that method, we'd have a lot fewer problems.

       From:    David Drexler/Mark Grennan, sysops REMARK 19/202
       Subject: Libraries and Squeezed files: an Explanation
       Date:    10 DEC 85

            Among  the  most frequently asked questions  on  REMARK
       are:  "What are .LBR files?",  and "How do I use files  like
       TEXT.TQT?"  Those  of you who have been working with  micros
       for  years will probably not find this article very  useful;
       the rest of you: lissen up!

            Nearly  any  filename extension that has a 'Q'  as  the
       second letter (ex.  TEXT.TQT,  FILE.QQQ,  PROG.CQ) has  been
       packed  with a variant of SQ.  SQ uses an algorithm known as
       Hoffman  Dynamic  to compress a file so that  there  are  no
       repeating bit patterns in it. Before the file can be used in
       any way,  it must be unpacked with USQ,  NUSQ,  or a similar
       program.  SQueezed  files,  whether originating on MSDOS  or
       CP/M, can be unsqueezed on either system.

            Files  with  the  .LBR filename extension  are  library
       files  created  with LU or one of  its  many  variations.  A
       library  is a collection of files,  tacked together  end-to-
       end,  with  an  index at the head to identify each of  them.
       Library files are likewise portable between MSDOS and  CP/M.
       The primary reasons for using libraries are to (a) collect a
       group of related files into a single unit for organizational
       purposes, and (b) to save disk space.

            Libraries are great for grouping an executable together
       with its documentation and source code;  when you download a
       library, you'll likely find that all the pieces are there in
       one unit. Likewise, you should put those sorts of files into
       a library before you upload to a board.

            A  file  that contains fewer bytes than  the  operating
       system's allocation unit size (4096 bytes under MSDOS) still
       reserves  the full allocation unit on disk.  For example,  a
       file  that is 10 bytes long on an MSDOS system takes up  the
       full  4k allocation unit on disk.  Ten such files would  use
       only 100 bytes in actual space,  and would waste nearly  40k
       of  disk  space!  If those same 10 files were collected  to-
       gether  into  a library as a single file,  only 4k  of  disk
       space would be reserved.

            Files  are  SQueezed for similar reasons;  if  the  un-
       squeezed file takes up just a little bit over an  allocation
       unit,  then squeezing it will save some disk space.  Another
       reason  why files are squeezed,  and put into libraries  (if
       they are libraryized and then squeezed,  the filename exten-
       sion  is  .LQR) is to reduce transfer time over  the  modem.
       Sysops  often squeeze files that are already smaller than 4k
       for that reason.

            A   discussion  of  library  and  compaction   programs
       wouldn't  be complete without a mention of ARC,  one of  the
       most  useful of this genre of utilities for MSDOS  (we  hope
       that  it will eventually be available for CP/M - Thom?)  ARC
       performs the functions of both a library program, and a file

       compression program, in one step, and is far more efficient,
       versatile, and easier to use, than any others I have encoun-
       tered.  Rather than go into detail here, I will suggest that
       you obtain the documentation and examine it. Thom Henderson,
       editor and distributor of Fido News, is the author of ARC.

                        More Sysop Utility Updates
                                    by
                               Bob Hartman
                           Sysop Fido 132/101
                            The UN*X Gateway
                          and Home of Rovermsg


            Well, after many moons I have finally updated another
       Sysop favorite, the FILEDATE program.  As many of you know,
       this is a program which creates a file containing a list of
       all files that are listed in all of your FILES.BBS files,
       along with their creation date, what directory they are in,
       their size, and the description that goes along with them.
       This is useful for each Fido node to do, since a user can
       then T)ype this file and see which files have been recently
       updated or changed (after the file gets run through the sort
       program, the most recently changed files are listed first).
       Anyway, on some strange versions of DOS, this command used
       to give the strange error "can't chdir(directory)", where
       directory was a valid Fido directory.  Worse yet, it would
       actually leave you in that directory after saying it could
       not get there!  Well, I think that I have fixed the problem,
       and the new version should work properly.  Any Fido sysops
       that would like the new version can call my board at any
       time and download it from the FIDO file section.

            Also, I have released version 2.14 of Rovermsg.  This
       new version has some nice enhancements including the fact
       that if you use the 'RK' (reply and kill) command, then
       abort the message, Rovermsg will not delete the original.
       Also, Rovermsg and SEAdog and Fido can all understand each
       other.  There were some problems with Rovermsg not being
       able to read messages created on a SEAdog system, but that
       has been fixed.

            Oh well, that is all I have for this week, but I am
       hoping to have some more news about Rovermsg, Filer, Renum,
       and Filedate in the near future.

                              PIBTERM Review


                 I have been using PIBTERM v3.2 communications
       software for about 2 months now and think it is just great.
       Having used many commercial communications programs as well
       as several public domain programs, I just wanted to share my
       experience with this one with you.  PIBTERM is written by
       Philip Burns and distributed for free for noncommercial use.
       The source code is also available.

                 I run a Fido electronic bulletin board (net/node
       108/10) and enjoy the nice features of the Telink file
       transfer protocol; namely supporting batch transfer and
       original DOS file size and time/date stamp.  PIBTERM
       supports Telink file transfer protocol as well as Xmodem
       checksum and CRC, Modem7 checksum and CRC, Ymodem, Kermit,
       ASCII and Compuserve 'B'.

                 PIBTERM has a dialing directory which is stored as
       a straight record oriented ASCII file.  This is particularly
       nice since you can use your favorite editor if you want to
       add several entries at one time.  Also you can easily SORT
       the file alphabeti-cally or by area code using as unpowerful
       a program as the DOS SORT routine.  I use a .BAT file which
       FINDs all records with an entry, pipes to SORT and outputs
       to the directory file to periodi-cally maintain my dialing
       directory.  PIBTERM also has a built in area code directory.
       You supply the area code and PIBTERM will tell you where it
       is or you supply a state and PIBTERM will tell you what area
       codes are covered.

                 PIBTERM emulates several terminal types: VT52,
       VT100, ANSI, dumb terminal and dumb terminal in split-screen
       mode.  VT52 is good to use with Compuserve, ANSI works well
       for the BBS's with their color graphics and music, VT100
       works for many main-frames and the split-screen is a must
       for conferencing on net-works.

                 PIBTERM supports capturing of session to printer
       or disk and has macro-key definition capability.  PIBTERM
       has a script language similar to those of $200 commercial
       communi-cations programs.  You can setup completely
       automated sessions with this script language.  PIBTERM also
       has a built in HOST mode to use for unattended access to a
       PC for limited file transfer and message functions.

                              Rainbow Corner
                           by Theodore Needleman

       Last week's column speculated on the fate  of  the  Rainbow.
       This  week  we  know - it has been repackaged as the Rainbow
       190.  Big deal!  While I am glad to  see  that  the  Rainbow
       line  will  not  just  fade into oblivion,  I was hoping for
       something more than a  "Super  100+".  Except  for  the  new
       software,  some  of  you  are already running Rainbow 190's.
       Anyone who has a 256K Rainbow  100+,  with  the  "Gold  Key"
       keyboard option, just needs one of those little "190" plates
       and a piece of double-stick tape.

       Don't  get me wrong.  I think that DEC will be successful in
       selling the 190 into their existing VAX  user  base.  I  saw
       the Rainbow Office Workstation and WPS-PLUS/Rainbow Software
       packages  at their March 4th Merrimack press conference.  If
       you're running All-in-1 or WPS you're gonna love them.

       The problem I foresee is that DEC appears to  be  abandoning
       not  only  the retail market,  but the small business entry-
       level market as  well.  According  to  Henry  Ancona,  Group
       Manager-Office  and  Information  Systems,   "...stand-alone
       personal computing in the office is a thing  of  the  past".
       Well,  Henry,  maybe  in  your  office,  where  they  have a
       VAX/8600 or two, but there are plenty of one, two, and three
       person offices (and small businesses).  Lots of these people
       are  getting  into  computers  for  the  first  time.  Maybe
       they'll  buy  a  MicroVax,  maybe a $6500 Rainbow 190,  or a
       $3500 Rainbow 100.  Most likely they  are  going  to  buy  a
       $2500  IBM-PC.  People  tend  to buy products from companies
       that want to sell to them.  IBM has  been  selling  electric
       typewriters  to  one  person businesses for a long time (and
       has been more  than  happy  to  do  this).  Over  the  years
       they've sold a whole lot of typewriters.  They also are more
       than happy to sell you a computer.  You want a real big one?
       OK.  A  real little one?  That's fine too.,  Want to buy one
       today?  You won't even have to hunt around.  Just go to your
       nearby Computerland, Entre, MicroAge,  Sears Business Center
       or IBM Product Center, pay your money, and take your system.

       DEC's  positioning  of  the Rainbow as an adjunct to the VAX
       may  be  realistic  marketing,   but  it's  also   extremely
       arrogant.  Not  everyone  can  afford  to  spring  into full
       blown,  heavy-duty data processing.  Some of us would prefer
       to  grow  into it,  one "baby-step" at a time.  Rumors still
       abound  about  an  IBM-compatible  Rainbow.   Hope   springs
       eternal!

       Enough  diatribe,  on  to  other business.  Last week I also
       discussed Rainbow resources.  One of the resources mentioned
       was Bulletin  Board  Systems.  I  recently  came  across  an
       interesting one.  Located in Boston,  DEC-Line is a FIDO-net
       BBS specializing in the coverage of DEC's  Rainbow.  Run  by
       SYSOP (system operator) Bill MacNeill,  this BBS offers over
       a hundred public domain software programs for the MS-DOS and
       CP/M operating systems,  as well  as  a  separate  area  for
       MBASIC  programs.  Some of these programs look really useful


       Fidonews                   Page 16               23 Dec 1985





       and I will be reporting on a few of them after I have had  a
       chance to use them for a week or two.

       In addition to the public domain software, DEC-Line also has
       a message area.  This is a good place to "meet" people,  ask
       questions, or share information.  DEC-Line operates more-or-
       less 24 hours a day,  7 days a week at 300 or 1200  baud  (8
       bits,  no parity, 1 stop bit).  You can reach it at 617/721-
       1688.  Give DEC-Line a call.  I think you'll like  it.  When
       you  do,  be  sure  to leave a message to the SYSOP that you
       heard about DEC-Line here at Rainbow Corner.

       The last piece of business  for  this  week's  column  is  a
       modest  proposal.  One  of  the  problems in being a Rainbow
       owner is finding software that runs on  your  system.  Sure,
       the   Rainbow  Referral  Software  Guide  lists  about  1400
       programs,  but this is a small percentage of  the  estimated
       30,000  to 50,000 programs supposedly available for the IBM-
       PC.  Many of these "generic" MS-DOS  programs,  as  well  as
       CP/M-80  programs,  will  run  on the Rainbow.  Transferring
       them onto RX-50 media is not a tremendous problem  (see  the
       article  in  the  MARCH  '85  HARDCOPY),  just  a  bit  time
       consuming.  Thinking about all those programs that might run
       on  the  Rainbow  gave  me  an  idea.  I  call  it  "PROJECT
       TRANSPORT".

       "PROJECT  TRANSPORT"  involves  a concerted effort to obtain
       software released in formats for "other" computers,  port it
       over to the Rainbow, test it to see how (or if) it runs, and
       report the results.  As the project progresses,  the results
       would be reported here in Rainbow Corner, with the intention
       of publishing an annual (or bi-annual)  compendium.  Nothing
       too  fancy,  you  understand.  Just the name of the program,
       its provider,  the original system it was intended for,  the
       porting method,  whether or not it ran on the Rainbow,  and,
       if so, how well.

       I need your help with this,  in the form of  some  feedback.
       Take  a  moment,  and  write to me.  It doesn't have to be a
       letter,  or postcard,  I'll give my Source ID,  and MCI mail
       address, as well as my P.O. Box.  Let me know what you think
       of  "PROJECT  TRANSPORT"  (YES,  NO,  or  YAWN).  Are  there
       programs (or types of programs) in particular you would like
       to see tested?  If there's  a  specific  piece  of  software
       you'd  like  to  see  tested,  I'll  contact  the author and
       request a review/loaner copy.  Are there packages  you  have
       already ported and tested?  If so, I'll report the results.

       So  drop me a line.  Letters and postcards should go to IDEA
       TECHNOLOGY, P.O. Box 668, New City, NY 10956.  SourceMail to
       TCA920, and MCI mail to "THEODORE NEEDLEMAN".

       See you next week.
