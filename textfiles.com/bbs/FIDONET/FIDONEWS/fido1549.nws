     Greetings,

     Have you had contact with Zone 6 lately?  It appears they are just
     at their end of usefullness.  I mean, they may as well not exist, as
     nothing is being heard from that part of the world.

     Mike Muller <mik@treebranch.com> would like to know if you have any
     NODELIST or DIFFS files around from say 6 years ago.  He is looking
     for a friend who he seems to think, was in net 1:2078 NYC.
     Please e-mail him direct.  Thanks.

     Happy reading,

     PS: Another article did not wanted to be taken up by Makenews and
         as such, I have appended it to the end of this issue.  My
         apologies in advance, if this issue does not print to well.

     What's Wrong wiht this Picture?

                       What's Wrong with this Picture?
                         The Other Fidonews Position
                       Douglas Myers         1:270/720

     Henk Wolsink's editorial in last week's Fidonews has found one
     ardent supporter in Bob Morasvik.  Bob apparently feels that it can't
     be comprehended in one reading, and has bent his effort to reposting
     it on a daily basis to anyone who will listen and many who won't.
     Parts of that article are quoted here.  Readers who wish to see the
     full editorial in context are invited to review last week's Fidonews
     or just about any Bob Morasvik post in the FN_SYSOP echo this week.

     Henk's editorial presents his opinion of an action by Thom LaCosta,
     the Echolist Keeper.  Thom's action followed a recent election in
     the FN_SYSOP echo.  Echo rules mandate an annual election of the
     moderator.  Rob Ferrara was elected to this position this year,
     defeating Zorch Frezberg, the incumbent.  The problem developed when
     Rob contacted Zorch to get the echo password, a necessary item for
     changing the echo listing.  Zorch did not respond to Rob's request,
     except to change the listing naming Rob as moderator, but retaining
     the password.  Rob requested the Echolist Keeper change the password
     to one of his choosing.  Since Rob was the moderator by virtue of
     both the election and, at that point, by the echo listing... Thom
     complied.  After Thom changed the password to give Rob control of
     his echo, Zorch Frezberg broke his silence and revealed a
     questionable "trusteeship" which, he claimed, gave him to right to
     control the password irregardless of the fact that he'd been voted
     out of the moderator position (with whom the password normally
     resides).

     Henk came down firmly against this in his published opinion last
     week, stating in part:

     -------- extracted from Henk Wolsink's Editorial Opinion --------

     The list keeper has NO right to -

        a. supply the new moderator the current password or
        b. change the password or
        c. change details of the echo with(out) permission of the
            password holder. ie. Ex-moderator in the above scenario.

     -----------------------------------------------------------------

     Applied to the events which actually transpired, these high sounding
     principles translate into little more than a ringing endorsement for
     Zorch Frezberg to do as he wishes with the area FN_SYSOP, despite
     the expressed wishes of the sysops in that echo, and despite the
     rules and tradition which make them the owners of that echo.

     Henk moves on to this passionate conclusion:

     -------- extracted from Henk Wolsink's Editorial Opinion --------

     Secrecy has been violated!  Get rid of the echolist keeping system.
     It's useless with what has happened recently!

     -----------------------------------------------------------------

     And he's correct that secrecy has been violated.  But it's the
     "secret" trustee arrangement which has been busted - an arrangement
     which was only known to Zorch Frezberg, Bob Morasvik, and Bob Kohl.
     This was an arrangement se secret that it couldn't be shared with
     the sysops, the owners of the echo, at any point during the
     election.  This was an arrangement so secret that it couldn't be
     shared with the Echolist Keeper until after he took the common sense
     action which busted it.  This was an arrangement which, when finally
     exposed to the light of day in an effort to discredit the Echolist
     Keeper, was universally rejected by the sysops participating in
     FN_SYSOP... the owners of the echo, and the very people for whom the
     password was supposedly held in "trust."

     But is Henk correct that the Echolist Robot should now be abandoned,
     a useless commodity?  That would depend on your view as to the rule
     of the Echolist Keeper.

     One school of thought is that all Fido positions should be that of a
     clerk.  Fidonet Coordinators should just write their section of the
     nodelist and stay away from any decisions.  Thom should just let the
     robot run unattended and stay out of anything requiring judgement.

     I reject that position myself.  Neutering those who hold a Fidonet
     office simply puts someone else in charge... in this case the person
     who can find a loophole in the existing rules, the person who can
     convince others that a rule exists where it doesn't, or he who can
     seize such things as knowledge of a password and elevate that
     acquisition to greater prominence than a proper election.

     The other view is that Fido positions are a trust, and the office
     holders should actively seek to improve Fido... should help when
     help is needed, and do what needs to be done to make the system
     work.

     Thom did what needed to be done, and my editorial hat is off to him.

     [ ED:  No Douglas, I do NOT support Zorch, nor Thom and neither YOU!
       What I write in the editorial, is how I see it and believe it is
       happening, for the good or bad and my comments and/or views, are
       mine and NOT that of the ZCC or the IC nor for that matter, of
       FidoNet and it's SysOp's.
       There are many ways to kill a bird, or what ever saying you wish
       to use, and I still believe Rob could have used alternative ways
       in getting the password.
       Please note: Zorch made an announcement in that he conceeded he is
       no longer the moderator of FN_SYSOP and Rob having won most of the
       votes and as such, was declared the moderator.

       Your comment about FidoNet positions, has nothing to do with the
       e-list system.  But since you brought the subject of 'positions'
       to the fore, how about killing of Policy 4? :-)

     Nonsense.  The list keeper had no choice in the circumstances.
     Withholding the password from an elected moderator for any reason
     would be doing a disservice to all of the participating sysops.

     SYNOPSIS:

     FidoNews is the newsletter of the FidoNet computer network,
     for both its Sysops and users.  It is passed to its readers
     electronically via the FidoNet and other computer networks
     and to non-network readers as well as to the InterNet.

     This document intends to tell you how to write and submit
     articles for publication in FidoNews.  Much of it describes
     the technical specifications which an article must meet in
     order to be included in the newsletter, as well as broad
     (very) guidelines on content.  (Of course you realize
     articles can be submitted only electronically.)

     Please read this document carefully.

     The article you save might be your own.


     -----------------------------
     INTRODUCTION:

     FidoNews was originally founded in early 1984 to include
     all parts of the lives of its member Sysops and users,
     which of course means not just technical matters.  We do
     not have fixed goals of maximum distribution or maximum
     readership (i.e. lowest common denominator) but only to
     meet the needs of our individual network members.  The
     success of this venture has always been contentious at
     best (ahem).

     In any case the grand experiment continues.

     Over fifteen years later and roughly 20,000 Nodes in the
     FIDONEWS 15-49               Page 7                    7 Dec 1998


     network, the editorial policy, or lack of one, of FidoNews
     has shown to best fit our ever-changing and unpredictable
     needs.


     -----------------------------
     SUBJECT MATTER:

     Articles on any subject of interest to FidoNet members and
     users are welcome and encouraged, not necessarily of a
     technical nature, though priority may be, but not
     necessarily, given to articles of importance to the FidoNet,
     its technology and its uses; other networks such as uucp and
     the Internet; social aspects of communications; ethical
     issues; other related matters.


     -----------------------------
     ARTICLE LENGTH:

     Try to keep articles short.  The longer it is, the less
     likely people are to read it.  Consider splitting long
     articles (more than five pages) into smaller articles to
     be run serially.

     Exceptions will be made at the whim of the editors.

     For practical reasons, we will attempt to keep FidoNews to
     a "reasonable size", which is of course a highly subjective
     and variable thing.  As of Mar 1998, the goal is to keep
     each issue under 100,000 bytes.  Decisions regarding content
     may be made based upon this, though in general it shouldn't
     be an issue.

     As above, exceptions will be made at the whim of the
     editors.


     -----------------------------
     WRITING GUIDELINES:

     We are not all professional writers, nor is that even a
     goal for the FidoNews -- we want real communication to and
     from real people; even at the expense of so-called "good
     writing", which is frequently a tool to exclude.

     There are, however, a few minimum requirements for any
     successful writing, even for the lowly FidoNews:

     * The subject discussed must be clear to people other
       than the author!  Don't assume that people will pick
       up the context from your writing.  Tell them
       _explicitly_.

     * Why are you writing this?  It may _seem_ obvious --
       "Review of the new Acme 75-baud Modem" -- but it's
     FIDONEWS 15-49               Page 8                    7 Dec 1998


       not.  Are you the manufacturer? An irate customer?
       Let us know your point of view.

     * Who *are* you?  A good question!  Anonymity is
       acceptable, though most people want to take credit
       for their work.  Include full contact information
       including NetMail and E-Mail addresses, where such
       is feasible.

     * Articles submitted via Netmail or E-Mail must
       contain all the technically required lines and
       delimiters in the BODY of the message.  This
       includes the *[title] line and the 70 character
       width requirement.  To indicate the filename type for
       one of these message submissions, place the
       FILENAME.TYP in the SUBJ: line of your E-Mail,
       NetMail, or EchoMail.  Those that require extra
       editing may be delayed from appearing in FidoNews.

     * Articles will appear when space becomes available,
       not necessarily the "next" issue.  If your article
       is of a time-critical nature, please say so when you
       submit it; the editor still has final say.

     * The editor reserves the right to request changes
       from an author to meet these "standards", which you
       have to admit are pretty loose. It is not the intent
       for this to be a mechanism to refuse articles the
       editor does not like, but simply to keep the
       contents intelligible.

     * If we have a backlog of articles, we may get fussier
       about things.  Historically, this has not been a
       serious problem.


     -----------------------------
     SUBMITTING AN ARTICLE

     TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

     If all that hasn't scared you away, the next step is to
     create a text file which contains the text of your article.
     The resulting file should be sent or uploaded to "Editor",
     | FidoNet address 5:5/23, or to "editor@fidonews.org".

     The "physical" location (and phone number) of FidoNews
     varies, and hence must be found elsewhere, such as
     within a recent copy of FidoNews itself.

     Filenames must follow the MSDOS standard:

         FILENAME.TYP

         a 1 to 8 character file name (A - Z, 0 - 9)
         a period,
     FIDONEWS 15-49               Page 9                    7 Dec 1998


         a 0 to 3 character file type (A - Z, 0 - 9)


     File types are used to distinguish types of submissions, as
     follows:

         .LET Letters to the Editor.
         .ART An article, commentary, open letter, or
              general news item.

               renamed to .GUE]

     If your file doesn't have one of the above extensions, then
     it will lay around taking up disk space until someone takes
     a look at it and realizes what it is.

     Maybe.

     The name of the file is up to you, though you should use a
     name which is not likely to be "stepped on" by someone
     else -- the system will not guarantee file names are unique.
     For example, FNEWS.ART is probably not a good name for an
     article.


     -----------------------------
     CHARACTER SETS:

     The character by character contents of the file itself must

     meet the following standards or it cannot be published in
     FidoNews.

     The FidoNews staff WILL NOT be responsible for making file
     contents conform to these standards.

     * FLUSH LEFT MARGIN:  Please do not put a "left margin"
       on your articles.  Have the text start at the very
       first column.

     * RIGHT MARGIN AT COLUMN 70 OR LESS:  Less is tolerable,
       more is definitely not.  If your cursor is resting at
       column 71 when your line is ended, you're okay.  But,
       *one* character past that, even with trailing spaces
       and MAKENEWS will barf on your submission.

       If your submission is physically rejected, the Editor
       will have to fix it manually or send it back for
       reformatting.

     * RAGGED-RIGHT TEXT:  Word-Star style "justification"
       (inserting spaces into sentences so that a paragraph
       is perfectly rectangular) is extremely hard to read,
       and consumes needless space.  Please don't use it!

     * NO FUNNY CHARACTERS:  This includes formfeeds, returns
       without linefeeds, linefeeds without returns, tabs and
       other oddities.

       The only control codes (character codes 0 through 31
       decimal) allowed are carriage return (CR) and
       linefeed (LF).  The only exception is:  Control-Z
       "end of file" terminator characters are tolerated.
       Not required.

     * NO GRAPHICS CHARACTERS:  Believe it or not, not
       everyone in the world has an IBM PC.  Please restrict
       yourself to printable ASCII characters in the range
       20 hex to 7E hex (space to tilde).

     * LINES TERMINATED:  Each line in the article should
       be terminated with a 'newline' -- either the MSDOS
       standard (CR/LF) or the unix standard (LF only).

     SUBMISSION FORMAT:

     Below is a sample article properly formatted.  Features of
     it are discussed further below.

     *A Sample Article [this is in LINE 1 starting at COLUMN 1]

     This is My Title
     by Joe Schmoe, [Netmail/email address]

     And here is my article. Note that it is flush left (zero indent).
     Also note that the right margin is at column seventy so that it
     won't overflow "most" text windows. Each line has a newline. Note
     the *'ed first line. My article will be listed in the table of
     contents exactly as it appears after the * above.

     Figure 1.                       Table 1.
             +-------+               ========
             | A Box |                 Alpha
             +-------+                 Bravo

     Note that we am not using any funny-o characters. This ensures
     that the final article will look the same to every user, no
     matter what sort of hardware he has.

     This is the last sentence of our article.

     --article file example ends above this line--


     The FIRST line of text is the Table of Contents line.  It MUST
     begin with an asterisk * as shown above.  NO BLANK lines above
     title line are permitted.  If you do not follow this instruction
     exactly, the article will not be listed in the Table of Contents.
     This Table of Contents listing method works for all submission
     file types.

     * Everything that follows the *'ed line will appear in
       the body of the newsletter.  The *'ed line will be
       stripped out of your article text so if you want it
       repeated as your title in the article BE SURE to REPEAT
       it on a second line without the *.

     * Next should be the title or name of your article,
       your name, and contact information (network
       address(es), Postal Service address, etc).  Try to
       keep it to one or two lines each.

     * Put a blank line between paragraphs.  Paragraphs that
       all run together are very difficult to read, and may
       be rejected.

     * If you want to put in a table or a figure, go right
       ahead.  We do not rearrange text if you follow these
       submission guidelines, so your table or figure should
       remain exactly as you entered it. Try to limit them
       to ones that make the communication CLEARER.

     * Don't put a lot of blank space at the top or bottom.
       The FidoNews-generator programs will visually
       separate articles automatically.

     * Please check for basic errors in spelling, grammar,
       and punctuation. We're not publishing a textbook, but
       you don't want it to embarrass yourself do you?

     * Don't use FidoNews to grind your personal axes
       against other FidoNet members.  An article presenting
       a side of an internal dispute is one thing.  An
       article defaming or perseverating over several
       Issues is another.  Articles that merely quote
       endlessly from other sources to no particular effect
       are also not a good idea.

     * Don't republish copyrighted material from other
       sources WITHOUT the permission of those sources.
       Include the permission in such articles.

     * Remember that FidoNews is no better or worse than
       the articles submitted to it. If you want FidoNews
       to be a useful newsletter, get involved and submit
       useful articles. It's up to YOU to make it work.

     Todd Cochrane on the subject of supporting the OBO:

     -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Give the man a chance. Personally I think it is time a lot of us
     FIDONEWS 15-49               Page 13                   7 Dec 1998


     started pushing our way into roles within this organization the old
     guard has sat on there ass for years and accomplished nothing.

     They are arguing over the exact same issues now as they were 6-7
     years ago. I have been at this as long as anyone probably longer
     than most yet the same people same idiotic ideals keep pulsating
     thru and personally it is way beyond time to move forward

     Maybe you ought to get on the bandwagon and help this thing move
     forward instead of bitching all the time. There was a time when
     Sysops helped one another and it was like a unwritten oath that you
     were to help your fellow sysop.

     Today all i here is me me me me me me etc... Get a grip instead of
     bitching ask butch if he needs any help and offer assistance instead
     of criticizing him..

     I am very glad he put John in his place it was time that John get
     knocked around a bit he is to big for his own britches..
     -------------------------------------------------------------------


     Dave Hamilton on the subject of sysop-level elections:

     -------------------------------------------------------------------
      DS> The best thing he could do is to return Fidonet to the sysops by
      DS> trashing P4, breaking up the "inner circle", and immediately
      DS> calling for a ZC election.

     Who would vote? 30% of R12 sysops?

     I don't disagree with a lot of what you say, but I think you are one
     step ahead of what needs to be done. What is the point of Satti
     turning Fido over to the sysops when they don't even know who he is?
     Or who their RC is? Or their NC?

     Fidonet needs to be promoted INSIDE of Fidonet before it is promoted
     outside. Then we can know if there is anything left to salvage.

     It may be that all that will survive is the IP-listed nodes and the
     WWB; I don't know. What I DO know is that rigor mortis has set in to
     the vast majority of sysops, and even the active ones are leaving.

     Sure, let's have sysop-level participation. But first, let's find a
     way to wake the sysops up.

     Hello Henk,

     As a point of interest, the Zone 1 Nodelist Segment now contains a
     special section listing IP Nodes. This segment is using the 1:1/3xxx
     series of numbers and appeared first in NODELIST.331
     Zone 1 is using the flags proposed by Lothar Behet (2:2406/301) in his
     recent FTSC submission to designate the IP protocols in use by those
     FIDONEWS 15-49               Page 14                   7 Dec 1998


     nodes.
     I have been designated as the IP Segment Coordinator for Zone 1 and
     will be accepting further listings upon notification from nodes that
     wish to be added to this segment.

        | There isn't always something happening on Fidonet, but |

                              A FALLEN STAR

     If a star falls where no one can hear, does it make a sound?  The
     publication which charts the movement of the stars, BACKSTAT.NA,
     footnoted a change in the Fido Echomail Constellation last week:

                              ------------------
     Zone Hubs:
       Eastern Star   George Peace      1:270/101    george@paonline.com
       Southern Star  John Souvestre    1:396/1      johns@sstar.com
       North Star     Ken Wilson        1:12/12      kwilson@ccai.com
                              ------------------
     Bob Seaborn, the NorthWestern Star, has fallen,,,

     The rumblings between the Southern Star and the NorthWestern Star
     have portended this change.  John Souvestre and Bob Seaborn engage
     in constant wranglings over such cosmic issues as the importance of
     low-volume echoes, backbone listing protocol, suitability of Gecho
     as a tosser, whether Bob joined NAB or John joined Fidospine...

     So what's not happening here?

     To my knowledge, there's been no change in echomail connections
     related to the fallen star, no change in traffic patterns... nothing
     except a change in the listing.  Bob Seaborn has still not conceded
     that he's part of NAB, John Souvestre does not concede that he's
     part of the FidoSpine, and George Peace and Ken Wilson continue
     their strong tradition of not commenting on the proceedings.

     A star has fallen, but without impact...

               -------------- Hold the Presses! --------------

     In a late reading of the echoes, I find a post by Bob Seaborn
     conceding that he is an NAB Zhub.  Now that he's paid ritual homage,
     will his star rise again?  Or will John Souvestre reciprocate with
     an announcement that he's a FidoSpine Zhub.  Will the echoes
     continue to move?  Will Lisa Gronke ever figure out the topology?
     Stay tuned to the BACKBONE echo for the continuing Star Opera...
