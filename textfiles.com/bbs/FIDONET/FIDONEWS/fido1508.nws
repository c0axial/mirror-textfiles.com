     What can I say, other than this has been one heck of a week?

     With this issue, and an hour later than I planned, I am assuming
     the role of Editor of one of FidoNet's oldest traditions, and
     will turn the FidoNews into a "sewer of feces and lies", as
     one Region Echomail Coordinator claims my appointment has caused.

     And I haven't even *published* an issue until now.

     Of course, this fails to note that the FidoNews is made from the
     submissions of other sysops...all the Editor does is to bring these
     together, uncensored, into a coherent form.

     As long as the submission follows the ARTSPEC.DOC parameters (see
     the masthead at the end of the FidoNews for details), what is
     submitted is going to be printed.

     I would suggest, however, that the use of profanity unnecessarily
     doesn't always build up your audience to sympathize with you.

     There may be some changes in the format of the Snooze, interms of
     placement of articles and information, and alternate distributions
     are being discussed in the FIDONEWS echo.  Join us as the "de facto"
     FidoNews Editorial Board if you have input.  If you want to discuss
     an article you see here, connect to the NEWSCHAT echo, where each
     issue is posted each week.

     Beyond that, well...let's not give *everything* away at once, right?

     In this issue, we ignore the last two issues and pretend that they
     never happened, and continue with Ward Dossche's "Countdown to
     Destruction", two articles, and a plea for help from a person in
     Zone 2 who needs to know the routing set-up for a Fido<>InterNet
     Gateway.

     And, of course, the Zone 1 Echomail Coordinator Election results.

     Revitalizing a Small Part of Fidonet by Neil Hoener, 1:128/103,
     nhoener@fatalerr.com

     Introduction:

          Following is the approach that the Pikes Peak Net took to
     change, ward off, slow down, warp, the decline of Fidonet in Colorado
     Springs. You might find our path entertaining.  Hopefully it might
     even give you insight about how to combat the general malaise
     affecting Fidonet in your own local area.

     Background:

          Colorado Springs is a paragon of economic growth nestled in the
     shadow of Peaks Peak, one of Colorado's many 14,000 foot Rocky
     mountains.  It is home to the Air Force Academy, three air force
     bases and one army base.  High technology is in abundance here.  From
     the ever-present defense contractors, to telecommunications and
     computer giants in the private sector with MCI, DEC, USANET and HP;
     Colorado Springs is known in some circles as Little Silicon Valley.

          Since the early 1980s, Fidonet Net 128 (The Pikes Peak Net), has
     been an active partner in Colorado Springs' telecommunications and
     computing community.  Boasting of more than 80 BBS'es at its peak in
     1994-95 and just like the rest of Fidonet, we have been suffering
     from a general malaise and a drastic decline in the number of users
     that call our boards.

     Identifying the Problem:

          The commonly touted explanation for the decline in Fidonet
     callers has been that they were opting for the Internet over the
     Fidonet BBS community they used to call.  While the attraction for
     the Internet is certainly one of the reasons for decline in callers,
     we also found that they do not have the software they need to call
     us.

          In our surveys of local computer stores, we could not find a
     single terminal program that could be used to call an ANSI screen
     BBS.  Plenty of web browsers and web construction software, but not a
     single terminal program.  Fidonet is not being so much as abandoned
     for the World Wide Web, as our callers can not reach us.  They do not
     have and will not be able to find the prerequisite software they need
     to call the old style Fidonet BBS.

     Impact of Windows 95 on Fidonet:

          The general lack of commercial terminal software is singularly
     important when you consider the number of computers that have been
     sold in the past three years with the "point and click" simplicity of
     Windows 95.  It is this new generation of Windows 95 computer users
     FIDONEWS 15-08               Page 3                   23 Feb 1998


     that are not calling the old style BBSs.  The software giants have
     effectively steered our callers away from us.

          We began by identifying terminal software that would:

               1) allow an ANSI screen terminal display,
               2) use an external dialing directory and
               3) be easily understood and used by this new
                  Windows 95 generation.

          What we were looking for was a shareware windows product that
     was point and click.  What we found was a vastly improved upgrade to
     a terminal program originally included with Windows 95, HyperTerminal
     v.3.0.  We asked Hilgraeve, the author of HyperTerminal v.3.0, if we
     could distribute their software as part of our terminal software
     package and received their blessing.

          The beauty of HyperTerminal v.3.0 is you can place a dialing
     icon anyplace on a hard drive in a Windows 95/NT environment and
     invoke HyperTerminal by merely clicking on an .ht icon.  We wrote an
     install program that places a .lnk icon on the Windows 95/NT desktop
     and installed our BBS dialing icons to a directory created by the
     install program.

          Each of our sysops submitted a short readme file describing the
     theme of their BBS and they were placed with the dialing icons.  The
     BBS readme files were reformatted as .doc files, so a click on the
     file would default to wordpad, Windows 95's built in text editor.

     Distribution Scheme:

          Now that we had the software in place, the next question was how
     to get that software into the hands of our potential point and click
     Windows 95 callers.  Distribution of free proprietary software worked
     very well for AOL in the early 90s and it could work for us.

          We setup a web site with our terminal software and put the
     archive on disk in the local public libraries.  We then picked
     several computer-related locations in town to place disks and asked
     the proprietor if they would support Fidonet by providing display
     space.  There are still a surprising number of people out there that
     remember what Fidonet and a BBS are.

     Finance and Marketing Schemes:

          I am sure at this point you are saying, "DISKS?  Don't they cost
     money?"  Where did a bunch of hobbyist, amateur sysops come up with
     money to buy a lot of disks?  Well, four of our sysops came up with
     about 800 disks, another provided and designed the labels, others
     assisted with disk copying and still others dropped their ducats into
     a common pot to help out.  It was a true group effort, coordinated in
     our sysop echo and at our monthly Net meetings.

          Now to get the word out.  Peak Computing, a weekly Computer
     magazine for Colorado, publishes a list of bulletin boards systems
     for the state.  The senior editor of the magazine was extremely
     FIDONEWS 15-08               Page 4                   23 Feb 1998


     supportive and offered to place a full page ad advertising Fidonet,
     the availability of the software and where to find it.  She said
     she'll run the ad until we ran out of disks.

          The disks and labels cost about 26 cents a piece.  The displays
     we put up were in most cases provided by the location sponsor.  The
     library disks were placed in video cases donated by Blockbuster.
     They were going to thrown away anyway.  Always think "donation",
     you'll never know if you don't ask.

          After a month our sponsors noted the public response to the
     net's software offering and have offered to fund the next round of
     disks.  They are also suggesting additional ways they could
     distribute the disk.  This time we are going to shoot for a run of a
     thousand.

     Who knows where it will end.

     Conclusion:

          Where is Pikes Peak Net going with this effort?  The nay-sayers
     suggest that we are just flying in the face of change and all our
     efforts will be for naught.  However, this generation of computer
     users deserves to have calling options other than the large online
     services and the Internet.

          A hobbyist Fidonet BBS offers a sense of local online community.
     The large online services are huge, but have no community.  A
     hobbyist Fidonet BBS is free.  Neither the large services or the
     Internet are free by any stretch.

          Maybe the Pikes Peak Net is flying in the face of change, but
     we're having fun trying.  The net has more new callers and we're
     having an effect.  There is still room for the small hobbyist BBS in
     today's high-charged computer world.  We just need to give our
     callers the venue to call us and, if we have to, give them the
     software to do it.

          If you are interested in applying our experiences to your local
     Fidonet area, or if you would like to share your own net's success
     stories; contact the Pikes Peak Net NC via netmail at 1:128/0 or

     Why Web Pages?
                  A short article by David Hallford

     Have you ever read an echomail message that refers you to an
     Internet web page? Ever wonder why the person didn't just post
     whatever it was in the echo? I have. I have even been the point
     FIDONEWS 15-08               Page 5                   23 Feb 1998


     of a web page! I'm sure that gives me a greater claim to fame than
     my previously having been condemned to Hades for all eternity by
     someone who was not a "false modem scum".

     Having now shown why I became interested in the topic, I can
     continue.

     I spent a few nanoseconds wondering what the point of an 'assault'
     style web page was, when it dawned on me. No one can file a Policy 4
     complaint on the contents of a web page! Voila - a new 'work around'
     for Policy 4. I'll just learn a little HTML and say what I want about
     folks in Fidonet and they can't do anything against me, because I am
     outside the scope of Policy 4!

     After realizing this, I went and looked at my web page to see if I
     had said anything about folks in Fidonet. I went to http://www.the
     vision.net/hallford and looked. Hmmm a section that talks about my
     military service...maybe that was a 'slam' on the President of the
     United States?

     A section on TransX...hmmmm maybe that was a 'slam' on other
     software?

     Nope...couldn't find a negative word anywhere.

     Maybe I am misusing my web page. If any of my brother or sister
     SysOps has one of these 'assault' style web pages, could you please
     send me the data on it so I can go review it? I can write an regular
     piece for the Fidonews... a review of web page assaults, so to speak,
     if there are enough of them.

     The sad news is that after 11+ years in Fidonet, meeting and
     messaging with many SysOps, I just don't believe that there will be
     enough material for a continuing article.
