     =================================================================
                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================


     This is the Issue number where I took over the Editorial operation of
     FidoNews last year. It's STILL fun. [grin]

     This is quite a full Issue with lots of Echomail-related stuff and
     some odds and ends that came in at the last minute.

     One of the items is a note about the resignation of the FTSC Chairman,
     David Nugent [who is also ZC3]. This was first reported in several
     Sysop Echos and is confirmed here. Nugent is indeed resigning and is
     also leaving FidoNet. Along these lines, I sent direct Netmail to each
     Zone Coordinator asking for information, comment, and publication
     permission for any replies. They will appear here or in subsequent
     Issues as they arrive and are released for publication. Nugent advises
     that he has a few unpublished Proposals to get out and list updates to
     make before his successor takes over the Chairmanship and that will be
     done in the next weeks.

     Another is a plea for assistance from a fellow in Hong Kong who can't
     seem to get a Node number over there. Somebody help him, please.

     Speaking of the Comix section, if any .CMX come in that are political
     in nature, they will be reassigned to the Guest Editorial [.GUE]
     section so as not to confuse anyone. It also puts them up front.

     I forgot to add the two new sections mentioned in 1424 to the ARTSPEC
     doc. That omission has been corrected and the updated ARTSPEC.DOC has
     been hatched into the pipeline for the FIDONEWS file echo and
     ARTSPEC.ZIP into the SDS area SOFTDIST for further distribution. The
     entire ARTSPEC.DOC will be reprinted next week [due to space
     constraints this week] for information. Look for it once a year or
     whenever updated. The two, new sections are the .TRU and .FIC sections
     for FidoNet-related true stories or fiction. Both ARTSPEC.DOC and
     ARTSPEC.ZIP can be file-requested from this system or found on the
     FidoNews webpage and many other FidoNet file sources.

     And now that we've successfully put a robot rover on the surface of
     the planet Mars, maybe someone can tell me why FidoNet still doesn't
     have an International Coordinator? [How about that MARS MISSION?!!]

     Baker in the NET_DEV echo:

     Where O Where is the FTSC_Chair?

     I sent Internet email to David Nugent, davidn@csource.oz.au, and asked
     him.

     He said that he resigned as FTSC chair since he is leaving FidoNet at
     the end of July. His BBS is already offline due to lack of callers.

     He said he informed the other FTSC members of this fact about 3 weeks
     ago via the ftsc mailing list, but has gotten no response at all.

     He also says the ftsc web page will be disappearing at the end of July
     unless he finds a current member of the FTSC who is willing to
     maintain it.

         Hi, i'm a sysop in Hong Kong, I met a problem of applying a
         fidonet node in Zone6 Host700.

         A few month before, I have tried to contact 6:700/0 via netmail,
         however, his system doesn't receive any netmail at all, I assumed
         that his mailer couldn't work properly.

         Later, luckily, i found his E-Mail address from fidonet nodelist
         and i sent him a E-Mail about apply a fidonet node in Z6H700 with
         my system information, he then replied within a day and told me
         that he would help me to do so. However, a few weeks later, i
         didn't get any reply from him any more. i then got a fidonet
         nodelist to see if my node had already inside or not, but it had
         no change at all in Z6H700 part of fidonet nodelist. So I tried to
         send him the second E-Mail to him about the applying of fidonet
         node, he has replied that he would do so. Again, no more reply was
         received from him.

         Luckily, i read Fidonews and find out some fidonet sysop contact
         methods from it for help.

         I wanna have a fidonet node because of the international purpose
         and the fidonet node is always required if being a bbs product
         oversea distro sites in order to prove that my system works
         properly.  this is why i wanna join fidonet family. :)

         Now, i hope i can apply a fidonet node directly from ZC of Zone6
         but i can't find his e-mail address (E-Mail is the unique contact
         method for me for contacting oversea).

         Anyone can help me about this? below are my contact methods.

     A remark concerning FSC-0093
     by Frank Ellermann, 2:240/5815.1@fidonet.org

     Hello Chris...

     I don't know how this *.LET submission type is meant to work, but at
     least I try to stay within the 70 columns limit. <g> First an idea,
     how you could get more replies like this into FidoNews. Just replace
     the useless (?) publishing of pages in NEWSCHAT by posting of the
     complete articles there. Then whoever wants to answer can simply use
     the quote function of his news reader... et voila, a new article !?

     Two additions to your publishing of FSC-0093. Reduced seen-by lines
     are implemented in IMAIL version 1.85. If some users of this fine
     product weren't aware of it until today: Reduced seen-by lines are by
     far safer than tiny seen-by lines, because the vital informations to
     detect dup-rings automatically are preserved by reduced seen-by lines.
     So if you still use tiny seen-by lines today (and you're not by
     accident a zonegate :-), then please try reduced seen-by lines.

     Second point, it would be quite simple to extend FSC-0093 in a way
     that allows interzonal dup-ring detection. Still fully compatible with
     FSC-0074 (i.e. FTS-0004) of course, and mostly of interest for
     zonegates. Today it's almost impossible to detect multi-zone rings
     automatically, but based on the old SPTH-proposal it's possible to
     extend FSC-0093 in this direction... However, before I try it, there
     should be at least one zonegate (all those internet tunneling nodes,
     hi, that's you :-) really interested in using this method, if it's
     implemented in e.g. IMAIL or FASTECHO.

     "QOFM" to Chris, you probably know, that in practice FidoNews is the
     last working "official" glue keeping FidoNet together, don't you ?

                             Tnx and bye, Frank

     Got my CRC problems solved...

     Anybody with a nodelist later than day 150 punch up

     Susana Baratta 4:851/7

     The entry for this node contains high ascii characters at the end,
     some utils probably do not allow for this, so the CRC comes out
     incorrect!

     The bad file was NODEDIFF.157 which has a grunged entry. The CRC
     calculates correctly if the data type is changed from signed 8-bit
     FIDONEWS 14-27               Page 6                    7 Jul 1997


     (char) to unsigned char for the calculation...

     Therefore the CRC error message was correct because there was a
     problem, but incorrect because the checksum on the top line is
     accurate if you allow for the high-ASCII characters.

     I've really enjoyed figuring this out for myself.  I've spent a lot of
     time testing my routines for CRC calculation, and come to the
     conclusion that any nodelist utility really should check a byte at a
     time for illegal characters.  It may really slow things down, but it's
     probably for the best.

     ... Yes, Socrates himself is particularly missed.

     Subject: For FidoNews: FTPoint in z1 wanted

     This is for Fidonews. Please put it into the appropriate section.

     I am Mikhail Ramendik of Moscow, Russia, 2:5020/768.45,
     mikhram@dataforce.net

     I have a good command of English and want to receive some echos from
     the z1 backbone.  Notably HOLY_BIBLE and company, HISTORY and
     MILHISTORY . Even though some of them do get to z2, they're SLOW!!!
     And HOLY_BIBLE is NOT here AFAIK...

     What I am searching for is a Point in Zone 1 with Mail transfer via
     FTP (or if impossible - via VMODEM). I am a Point since 1993, have
     software tuned OK, will never generate dupes and annoy the bossnode.

     (Yes I have seen the commercial hub list. I wish I could use such a
     hub, but transferring the bucks from Russia is impossible)

     If anyone can help me join Z1 please email! Thanks in advance!

     As I figure it's better in this format than none at all, and I do find
     artspec a little off-putting, I've decided to post this to you as a
     message. Do with it what you will. :-)

     Fidowhere (Where can I get Fidonews?) by John "Fuse" Gardeniers
     (3:632/360.70)

     In FIDO1425 there was yet another comment about the unavailability of
     Fidonews, so I thought I'd share my own experiences in that regard.

     When I became a Fido point last late last year one of the things I
     looked forward to was getting a regular copy of Fidonews. This had
     always been intermittent, to say the least, on various local BBSes.
     Indeed, many BBSs around here don't even carry a single issue. :-(

     Having obtained lists of the available message and file areas I
     immediately proceeded to link to the Nodelist and Fidonews areas.
     "Great" I thought, I'll most likely get the first one within a few
     days. It was not to be. :-( After a couple of weeks I contacted my
     boss to try to find out why the news wasn't arriving.

     Not being a reader of it herself, my boss was a little surprised that
     Fidonews wasn't arriving at her system either. The system in question
     is a major mail hub, not just an end leaf. A few messages here an
     there soon revealed that Fidonews wasn't available locally, at least
     not via Fidonet. We did learn that it was readily available via
     Internet! The idea of having to use the Internet to obtain Fidonet's
     newsletter struck me as just a little absurd.

     Due to some persistence on the part of my boss we finally had Fidonews
     being delivered to these parts via Fidonet itself, as it always should
     have been. Am I the only one who finds at strange that so many sysops

     didn't bother chasing it up? We are in the largest network in the
     state, so many systems must have been affected by the unavailability
     of the newsletter. I wonder how many sysops currently believe that
     Fidonews has ceased to exist.

     On a slightly more critical note, the fact that so little effort
     appears to be put in by so many people to get a copy at all says quite
     a lot about it's value. :-/

     =================================================================

                        FidoSpine Distribution System Pledge

     1. The FidoSpine Distribution System recognizes all echoes as listed
        in the Echolist for June 1, 1997 (ELIST706.*) along with their
        first-listed moderator as the Moderator-of-Record.

     2. The FidoSpine Distribution System will initially carry all Fidonet
        Zone one echoes that appear in the June 1997 echo listing, plus
        some that are not. The FidoSpine Distribution System will use it's
        own echo distribution list, FIDONET.NOW. The FidoSpine Distribution
        System does not require echo listing renewals or minimum traffic
        levels for any echo(s).

     3. The FidoSpine Distribution System recognizes the Moderator-of-
        Record as the "owner" of their echo. As such all moderator requests
        for feed cuts are honored, provided that the moderator follows the
        path from the 'problem' system and works backwards.  Any FidoSpine
        Distribution System hub retains the right to not distribute any
        echo who's moderator's actions causes too much of a burden on their
        system or well being.

     4. The FidoSpine Distribution System recognizes the validity of
        Fidonet Policy 4.07 in determining the legality and appropriateness
        of messages carried in echomail. Since the Moderator-of-Record is
        the "owner" of the echo, The FidoSpine Distribution System
        recognizes the moderator's responsibility in maintaining the
        legality and appropriateness of message traffic in their echo(es).
        The FidoSpine Distribution System is not responsible for the
        content of echomail traffic.

     5. The FidoSpine Distribution System will work toward establishing
        SuperHubs in each zone and region. The FidoSpine Distribution
        System does not mandate any specific routing scheme, and allows
        each zone, region, and net to adopt and use their own methods. The
        FidoSpine Distribution System, where netmail and other traffic is
        concerned, will use routing charts provided by recognized Fidonet
        Coordinators (as indicated in the Fidonet Nodelist).

     6. The FidoSpine Distribution System distribution system will not
        interfere with any traffic in any echo, aside from eliminating
        duplicate messages ("dupes") and adding necessary routing
        information in accord with Fidonet Technical Standards.

     7. The FidoSpine Distribution System will accept input from any
        moderator as to a request to carry his/her echo. We will NOT
        require multiple requests from various NEC's and REC's to
        'authorize' distribution of any echo.  All that is required is that
        the moderator have properly established an entry in the current
        Echolist, and make a request of the FidoSpine Distribution System
        to distribute his/her echo.

     8. The FidoSpine Distribution System may, from time to time,
     FIDONEWS 14-27               Page 10                   7 Jul 1997


        establish, and distribute, technical criteria that messages must
        meet in order to be carried on FidoSpine. Such criteria may
        include, but not be limited to, definitions of character set,
        Origin Line length, age of messages, technical specifications of
        the SEEN-BY's, the PATH, the tearlines, and assorted control lines.

     Observational Titbits
     by Lee Kindness, 2:259/7

     Well, just a couple of observations...

     3:3/20, the FTSC Chair alias address is no-longer in the nodelist,
     what gives? A number of people have been trying to form a new FTSC
     (without an IC) but these guys should perhaps show a bit more common-
     sense (use NET_DEV rather than FTSC_PUBLIC due to NET_DEV having
     better distribution) and a bit more 'get-up-and-go' (like contact me
     about all those FTSC additions/revisions I published in Fidonews a
     couple of weeks back). I wonder if we'll ever see an FTSC entry in the
     nodelist ever again... Hell, a united world-wide Fidonet is looking
     very shakey...

     ftp.fidonet.org is now an alias for ftp.paonline.com rather than the
     IEEE server it used to be on. Interesting to note that only FSC
     documents up to fsc-0090 are on the site (up to fsc-0093 exist on
     ftp.blaze.net.au - the 'former' FTSC internet site) while the two
     'fta' documents by the would be new FTSC are present...

                          TRUE STORIES OF FIDONET
     =================================================================

     [This is the inaugural True Story of FidoNet. It's old but it's
      true. Send yours today!] Ed.


     [In 1989 I was injured on-the-job and had little and then no access
      to my FidoNet computer which was at work. The members of my Net at
      the time, built me a computer to use at home to operate the one at
      work remotely.]

     --Original post:

     This file is my way of expressing my gratitude to the members
     of my Net (FidoNet Net 1:135, SFLorida NET, Miami_FL_USA) for
     a holiday gift they presented me in mid-December.

     Composed on 5 Jan 89.

                       A Holiday Ode to Net 135
                         by Christopher Baker
                            RC 18 / NC 135

      Twas two weeks before Christmas and all thru my house,
      my body was aching, I started to grouse.
      "If I don't dump this backache and get back to work
      my Users and Sysops will think I'm a jerk."

      I'd been laid up at home for many a week
      and I had no computer through which I could speak.
      It's tough to do business without a remote and I'm sure
      many NCs thought things I can't quote.

      All the while in the background quite unknown to me,
      the folks of my own Net were planning a spree.
      They talked and they chatted and gathered up parts
      to build me a system for home, bless their hearts.

      They Netmailed and Echoed and telephoned, too,
      deciding just which part was what and from who.
      They assembled a system that was based on a Tandy;
      with modem and hard drive, I mean, it's a dandy!

      I was tired and cranky the night it was due
      and had NO idea this dream would come true.
      I had pains in my back and a pain in my head
      but my wife kept insisting I not go to bed.

      It didn't seem normal the way she cajoled.
      It wasn't till later she said, "I was told."
      So unknown to me I was being prepared
      for a real demonstration of how my Net cared.

      It was close to eleven P.M. when I said,
     FIDONEWS 14-27               Page 12                   7 Jul 1997


      "I can't stay up longer. I'm going to bed."
      Then suddenly and very much to my shock
      came a tap on the door and then a loud knock.

      "Ho, Ho, Ho!", said a voice not too clear through the door.
      "Open up! I have presents for you by the score!"
      The door was thrown wide to allow the sprite in
      but he wasn't in red; not a hair on his chin.

      He was thin as a rail and no Santa was he.
      I recognized Peter; our own NEC.
      "What the heck's going on?" I exclaimed to the air.
      He said, "Just a token to show that we care."

      He said nothing else but went straight to his work
      and set up the system then he turned with a smirk.
      "No more excuses!", he said, "Now, get cracking!"
      "Your traffic's piled up and the stuff keeps on stacking!"

      I stood there dumbfounded, amazed and confused.
      My mind boggled speechless and he seemed amused.
      "What? How? Who and why?", I managed to say.
      "It's nothing", said he, "now, get back in the fray!"

      It wouldn't sink in that such things still take place
      that confirm all your faith in the rest of the race.
      The best I could do was to stammer my thanks
      and then write this poem to honor our ranks.

      I still can't believe it and simply must say,
      "All the folks in my Net, you made my whole day!"
      "I never can thank you enough for this gift."
      "Your generous act brings a permanent lift!"

      So, all of the rest out in FidoNet land,
      keep your faith that our concept continues to stand.
      The FidoNet concept of help and of sharing
      is here. Look around and you'll see people caring.

      It's never too late to put egos aside.
      Let go some bygones and take them in stride.
      This Network is people and people are kind.
      When your urge is to flame them, please keep that in mind.

      To all of my Net, I say "Thank you, nth times!"
      To the rest of the world who are sick of my rhymes
      I say "I hope the New Year will bring you much joy!"
      Now, I think I'll stop here and go play with my toy! [grin]

                         The End


     Happy Holidays and Happy New Year to the wacky world of FidoNet!

                              FIDONET HISTORY
     =================================================================


     [This an abortive chapter of FidoNet History from 1989. This is the
      original EchoPol that was 'ratified' and then revoked by the IC of
      the period {David Dodell} as non-representative. With the recent REC
      Echomail effort, it might be well to reflect upon that which has not
      been enacted for going on ten years after Policy4. It has been
      reformatted to 70 columns for FidoNews and the spelling and
      punctuation corrected where necessary. The original is available at
      1:18/14 for file-request as ECHOPOL.] Ed.


                            GENERAL ECHOMAIL POLICY 1
                                April 22nd, 1989

       PROLOGUE

       This document sets forth policy governing Echomail conferences and
       their distribution.

       If any item in this policy is in conflict with any existing or
       subsequent General FidoNet Policy, then General FidoNet Policy will
       be in effect.

       This Policy applies to Zone One Backbone Echomail conferences and to
       any other conferences for which the Moderator desires it to be
       applicable.

       Future changes to Echo Policy may be proposed by any FidoNet Sysop
       by submitting the proposal to their REC. The REC will then determine
       if the proposal should be brought before the rest of the RECs. If an
       REC decides not to bring a proposed change before the rest of the
       RECs, a message stating why must be sent. If 10% or more of the NCs
       and NECs in a region request that a proposal be brought before the
       RECs then that proposal must be brought before the RECs.

       A majority vote of the Regional Echomail Coordinators is required in
       order for a proposal to be formally voted on. If 10% or more of the
       NCs and NECs in the Zone request that a proposal be formally voted
       on, then that proposal must be formally voted on.

       Those eligible to vote on any proposals made by the REC structure
       will be the ZEC, RECs, NECs, NCs, RCs and ZC.  Only one vote per
       person is allowed.  Adoption of changes will require a simple
       majority of those voting to pass.

       In this document, "a simple majority" means more than 50 percent
       of those voting.  A good faith attempt must be made to make all
       potential voters aware that a vote is occurring and make available
       all necessary information.


       I.  HISTORY
     FIDONEWS 14-27               Page 15                   7 Jul 1997


       Echomail consists of the sharing of message bases or conferences
       between various independent network addresses.  The Echomail concept
       started with a series of programs by Jeff Rush.  Since the original
       implementation, many authors have written programs improving on the
       original idea.  In spite of worries that the flow of Echomail would
       increase Netmail traffic to the point that the Network would
       collapse under its own weight, Echomail has been a success.  To
       simplify the distribution of Echomail, a national Echomail Backbone
       formed whose primary purpose is the distribution of Echomail at a
       national level.  Of recent introduction to the Backbone system has
       been the generous contribution of the Echomail Stars.  As a result
       of the growth of Fidonet and the increase in the volume of Echomail,
       it has become necessary to set forth a formal policy governing
       Echomail.


       II.  DEFINITIONS

            1. ECHOMAIL:  The process of sharing message bases between
               independent systems with unique net/node addresses.

            2. ECHOMAIL CONFERENCES:  An Echomail conference is a message
               base of forum design distributed under a specified
               conference name dealing with a defined area of interest.
               Notable examples include TECH, the National Technical
               Conference and COMM, the National Telecommunications
               Conference.

            3. MODERATED CONFERENCE:  A moderated conference is an Echomail
               conference for which a moderator has been appointed to
               supervise the flow and content of the conference.  All
               conferences carried on the Backbone must be moderated.

            4. SYSOP-ONLY CONFERENCE:  A Sysop-Only Conference is one in
               which the Moderator has decided that the conference will be
               made available only to Sysops and not to users.

            5. RESTRICTED DISTRIBUTION CONFERENCES:  A restricted
               distribution conference is one which is restricted only to
               eligible recipients.  Notable examples include REGCON, the
               Regional Coordinators Conference, COORD, the National
               Echomail Coordinators Conference, and MAGICK, a pre-register
               Echomail Conference.

            6. ZONE ECHOMAIL COORDINATOR (ZEC):  This individual is
               responsible for coordination of Echomail on a FidoNet Zone
               level.

            7. REGIONAL ECHOMAIL COORDINATOR (REC):  This individual is
               responsible for coordination of Echomail within his region.

            8. NET ECHOMAIL COORDINATOR (NEC):  This individual is
               responsible for coordination of Echomail at the Local Net
               level.

            9. ECHOMAIL Backbone:  The Echomail Backbone consists of
     FIDONEWS 14-27               Page 16                   7 Jul 1997


               voluntary members who provide services to enhance the
               national distribution of Echomail.  The Backbone consists of
               nodes which handle a high volume of Echomail traffic and are
               responsible for distribution of Echomail down to the
               regional level.

           10. NATIONAL ECHOMAIL LIST:  The National Echomail List
               identifies the available national conferences, the
               conference moderator and requirements of the specified
               conference.  The ZEC will appoint the keeper of the National
               Echomail List.

           11. AUTOMATED CENSORSHIP:  The term Automated Censorship refers
               to programs which cause messages to be removed from the
               intended conference or have their content altered.

           12. FIDONET POLICY:  The document which governs Fidonet as
               adopted by Fidonet.  The document as of this writing is
               Policy3 and is subject to change.  This policy is intended
               to become a part of general Fidonet policy.  Until it is
               incorporated into General Fidonet policy, this document
               shall serve to define policy violations occurring in
               Echomail.

           13. OPEN ACCESS CONFERENCE:  This is a non-restricted conference
               open to all users who are willing to follow the posted
               conference rules.

           14. TERMINAL NODE:  A system which does not process echomail for
               pickup by another system.


       III.  DUTIES OF ECHOMAIL COORDINATORS

            1. GENERAL:  It is the duty of the *ECs to make available to
               any Fidonet Sysop, any conference which the  Sysop is not
               prohibited from receiving by not meeting requirements as
               mandated by the conference moderator.  If for any reason the
               *EC does not have access via recognized distribution
               channels to a specific conference, they can not be expected
               to pass it on.  If a *EC fails to make available any
               conference to qualified lower distribution levels, this
               shall be deemed to have violated the outlined duties of the
               position held.  Such violation is cause for the removal as
               provided by this document.  Nothing in this provision
               requires that a *EC must import any conference to the extent
               of adverse economic impact.  It is recommended that cost
               sharing arrangements be employed.  Where financially
               feasible for the supplier any conference on the Backbone
               must be made available (other than restricted conferences)
               when requested.

               An exception is when a *EC cuts a link to end unauthorized
               distribution of a conference.  In this case, some otherwise
               authorized nodes may temporarily lose their link.

               A *EC shall do everything in their power to insure that:

                    1.   All downstream links are educated as to this
                         policy.
                    2.   Downstream links know how to properly link into
                         conferences.
                    3.   Acceptable and unacceptable behavior in echomail
                         conferences is explained.
                    4.   Downstream links are not engaging in topologies
                         that increase the risk of duplicate messages.

            2. DUTIES OF ZONE ECHOMAIL COORDINATOR:  It is the duty of the
               ZEC to coordinate the connections between the Echomail
               Backbone on both an inter-Zone and intra-Zone level as well
               as coordination of inter-regional connections.  The ZEC will
               coordinate transmission of Echomail and to provide for
               routing in a manner that will avoid the transmission of
               duplicate messages within the same conference.  It is also
               the duty of the ZEC to monitor compliance with this policy
               on both a national and international basis.

            3. DUTIES OF REGIONAL ECHOMAIL COORDINATOR:  It is the duty of
               the REC to provide for regional Echomail distribution.  In
               addition, the REC will coordinate any inter-regional cross-
               linking of conference feeds with the REC of the
               participating region with the direct knowledge of the ZEC.
               The REC will provide for transmission and routing of
               Echomail within his/her region in a manner to avoid creation
               of duplicate messages within the same conference.  It is the
               duty of the REC to monitor compliance with this policy at a
               regional level.

            4. DUTIES OF NET ECHOMAIL COORDINATOR:  It is the duty of the
               NEC to coordinate the intra-net Echomail and to cooperate
               with the REC and NECs of other nets to arrange for the
               inter-net transmittal of echomail.  The REC may require the
               NEC to provide links for independent (regional) nodes.  The
               NEC shall maintain a list of available Echomail Conferences
               within the net as well as the requirements of each
               Conference area as supplied by the conference moderator
               (Echolist).  The NEC shall also monitor compliance with this
               policy at a net level.

            5. DUTIES OF ECHOLIST COORDINATOR:  It is the duty of the
               Echolist Coordinator to compile and make available a listing
               of national and international Echomail conferences and,
               optionally, conferences at various local levels.  The
               content and format of the Echomail listing shall be at the
               sole discretion of the Echolist Coordinator, but shall
               include the conference name and moderator for each
               conference.  The Echolist Coordinator shall also maintain a
               list of requirements applicable to each listed conference.

            6. DUTIES OF ECHOMAIL CONFERENCE MODERATOR:  It shall be the
               duty of the Echomail Conference Moderator to make in good
               faith every reasonable effort to insure that the moderated
     FIDONEWS 14-27               Page 18                   7 Jul 1997


               conference does not distribute or promote illegal activities
               or information as defined below in Section V Paragraph 2.
               The Moderator shall be responsible for insuring that
               messages contained in the conference corresponds to the
               conference theme.  The Moderator shall report any violations
               of this policy to the proper Echomail coordinators and lodge
               any appropriate policy complaints as provided for in policy
               documents adopted by Fidonet.  The Moderator shall post the
               conference rules in the conference at least once a month.
               The Moderator is to authorize the disconnection of the
               conference feed.  Any Sysop the moderator believes is
               violating policy shall be reported to the offending node's
               nearest local echomail coordinator (may be a NEC, REC or in
               extreme situations, a ZEC); and the moderator shall formally
               authorize the feed to the offending node to be severed.  The
               conference moderator is the sole judge - subject to review
               only by the ZEC (or his delegates) if a complaint is filed
               by the banished party.  The Moderator may request in direct
               written form (netmail) that the *ECs disconnect a node from
               the conference when that node refuses to follow the
               published conference rules after at least 3 warnings.
               Knowingly feeding a conference to a node that has been
               severed by the Moderator is considered a violation of this
               echomail policy and is subject to suspension.  The length of
               this suspension will be determined by a joint decision of
               the conference moderator and the nearest local echo
               coordinator of the node illegally feeding the conference to
               the original offending node or point.

               Echo conference complaints from a Sysop should be filed at
               the net level (NEC) or if the complaining party is an
               independent node then with their REC.  The NEC or REC
               receiving such a complaint must take action in accordance
               with the provisions of this echomail policy.

               For severe or chronic infractions, the NEC, REC, or ZEC may
               file a complaint under general Fidonet policy for
               excessively annoying behavior.


       IV.  APPOINTMENT AND ELECTION OF ECHOMAIL COORDINATORS AND
            MODERATORS.

            1. GRANDFATHER CLAUSE:  Those Zone, Regional, and Net Echomail
               Coordinators and Echomail Coordinators currently holding
               these positions as of the date of acceptance of this
               Echomail Policy shall continue to service in said capacity
               until resignation or replacement under this policy.

            2. ELECTION OF ZONE ECHOMAIL COORDINATOR:  The ZEC shall be
               elected as follows:

                    a) upon resignation or replacement of the existing ZEC,
                    the FidoNet Zone Coordinator (ZC) shall nominate at
                    least five individuals to be voted upon.

     FIDONEWS 14-27               Page 19                   7 Jul 1997


                    b) 10 days after the nominees are selected, an election
                    shall be held.  The ZEC will be elected by a simple
                    majority of IC, ZC, RCs, NCs, RECs, and NECs in their
                    Fidonet zone.  An individual holding more than one
                    position can only cast one vote.  That is, if an
                    individual is both a NC and a NEC, they may cast only
                    one vote.

            3. ELECTION OF REGIONAL ECHOMAIL COORDINATOR:  The REC shall be
               elected as follows:

                    a) upon resignation or replacement of an existing REC,
                    the ZEC shall nominate at least 3 individuals for
                    election.

                    b) 10 days after the nominees are selected, an election
                    shall be held. The REC will be elected by a simple
                    majority of the RC, NCs, and NECs in their FidoNet
                    Region.  An individual holding more than one position
                    may only cast one vote.

            4. NET ECHOMAIL COORDINATOR:  The NEC shall be appointed by the
               FidoNet Net Coordinator (NC) or in such alternative manner
               as determined by the NC.  If a NEC is not appointed within
               30 days, the REC will appoint the NEC.

            5. REMOVAL OF A *EC:  A *EC may be removed from their position
               by a simple majority of those allowed to vote for their
               successor.  For a NEC, the members of the Net may vote by
               simple majority to remove the NEC.  The position directly
               above (in the *EC structure) will oversee the recall
               election in the same manner as prescribed for electing
               successors.

               A *EC may only be subject to recall for failure to properly
               carry out their  duties described above, or if they are no
               longer a member of  Fidonet.  A promise of 'free' echomail
               delivery from another source is *not* considered an
               acceptable reason for recall.

               A *EC maybe removed by the level above for continued
               violations of policy or for gross misconduct.

            6. RECOGNITION OF CONFERENCES:  The *EC corresponding to the
               appropriate level recognizes a conference at his level.
               Examples: The NEC recognizes a conference as local.  The REC
               recognizes a conference to be regional.  A ZEC recognizes a
               conference to be zonal.

            7. REMOVAL OF AN ECHOMAIL CONFERENCE MODERATOR:  An Echomail
               Conference Moderator may be removed from their position by a
               three fourths (3/4) vote of the *EC structure voting.  This
               vote must be carried out in a fair and decent manner while
               giving at least ten (10) days notice to the entire *EC
               structure of the upcoming vote.  The ZEC shall notify the
               RECs who in turn shall notify the NECs in their region of
     FIDONEWS 14-27               Page 20                   7 Jul 1997


               any upcoming vote.  Notice must be given via NetMail.
               Additional postings in such conferences as COORD and
               regional conferences are encouraged.

               An Echomail Conference Moderator may only be subject to
               recall for failure to properly carry out their duties
               described above or continued pre-meditated violation of this
               documents section V. Statement of Policies as seen below.
               Failing to perform the above duties of a conference
               moderator for a period of 3 or more months and/or failing to
               designate a proxy in his absence shall be in violation of
               this policy and be subject to recall.  A vote may only be
               callable by the ZEC (or his delegate).  This delegate should
               not be from the region or net of the affected conference
               moderator.

               Membership in Fidonet need not be a paramount issue, but is
               highly recommended.


       V.  STATEMENT OF POLICIES

            1. BASIC ECHOMAIL POLICY:  The basic policy of Echomail is to
               promote communication in Echomail Conferences in a lawful,
               friendly manner consistent with the general principles of
               FidoNet.

            2. PROHIBITION ON ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES:  Any Node which knowingly
               distributes or allows to be entered into echomail
               conferences any messages containing or promoting illegal
               activities or information shall be deemed to have violated
               general FidoNet policy as being excessively annoying.  As
               used in this paragraph, "illegal activities" includes
               activities which are a violation of civil law as well as
               activities which would result in criminal prosecution.

            3. AUTOMATED CENSORSHIP:  The use of Automated Censorship in
               the passing or distribution of echomail will be considered a
               violation of this policy and will not be tolerated.
               Disciplinary action will be as referred to in General
               Fidonet policy as being excessively annoying.

               An exception to this provision shall be the deletion and not
               censorship of messages by any Sysop which may lead to legal
               action against that Sysop.

               No echomail shall be modified in any manner which could
               potentially cause duplicates.

            4. INTER-NETWORK CONFERENCES:  Inter-Net conferences shall
               conform to general Fidonet policy as well as the provisions
               of this policy document in addition to any foreign network's
               provisions.  Conferences which originate outside of FidoNet
               must be designated as such in the list of conferences kept
               by the Echolist Coordinator.

     FIDONEWS 14-27               Page 21                   7 Jul 1997


            5. CHARGING FOR DISTRIBUTION:  Any entity which makes a profit
               from the distribution (passing from system to system) of
               echomail shall be deemed to be excessively annoying and in
               violation of Fidonet policy subject to enforcement under
               existing Fidonet policy.  Profit as defined in this
               paragraph is the charging for echomail distribution that
               exceeds actual cost to obtain and distribute the Echomail
               over a sustained period.  The cost of the equipment used to
               obtain and distribute echomail may only be recovered on a
               strictly voluntary basis.  A Sysop that charges users for
               access to their BBS shall NOT be in violation of this
               paragraph.

               Implementation of cost recovery plans may vary greatly.  In
               general cost recovery plans should not be overly
               restrictive.

            6. RESTRICTED DISTRIBUTION CONFERENCES:  Participating Nodes
               shall honor and support the restrictions placed upon
               restricted distribution conferences.  Violation of this
               restriction by individual nodes and points shall be a
               violation of this echomail policy and result in suspension
               of the violated echo in accordance with the above paragraph
               in Section III Duties of the Echomail Conference Moderators.

               A SYSOP only conference shall be made available only to the
               Sysops or Co-Sysops of Fidonet or other nets with which
               inter-net conferences exist.

               A violation of the restrictions placed on a RESTRICTED
               DISTRIBUTION CONFERENCE will be a violation of this policy
               if and only if the moderator has posted and specified the
               restrictions governing the conference.

            7. PATHLINE OPTION:  The PATHline (as defined in FTS-0004),
               originally implemented by SEA in the MGM package, is
               recommended for all nodes.  If your current Echomail
               scanner supports the pathline you should enable it.  While
               the pathline does not eliminate duplicate messages, it can
               be a very useful tool in determining where a topology
               problem exists.

               Systems operating as Echomail Stars, Backbone nodes, or
               Echomail Hubs must implement the PATHline option (as defined
               in FTS-0004 within 30 days of adoption of this policy.
               Since these system are operating beyond the scope of the
               typical FidoNet system, they are required to implement
               features that are otherwise optional.

            8. SEEN-BY LINE:  Under the current technology and topology
               (the routing structure of echomail), SEEN-BY lines play an
               important part in reducing duplicate messages.  Tiny SEEN-
               BYs will not be allowed until the respective ZECs feel
               topology will allow their use.  Nor will the stripping of
               SEEN-BYs (except Zone-Gates and Inter-Network EchoGates) be
               allowed unless approved by the ZEC.
     FIDONEWS 14-27               Page 22                   7 Jul 1997


               Violation of the above shall be excessively annoying
               behavior enforceable under general Fidonet policy.  Zone-
               Gates and Inter-Network EchoGates SHOULD strip the SEEN-BYs
               of the exporting Zone or Network to reduce addressing
               conflicts.

            9. COUNTERFEIT MESSAGES:  Entering or knowingly distributing
               counterfeit messages shall be considered excessively
               annoying and a violation of Fidonet policy enforceable under
               the terms of Fidonet policy.  As used in this paragraph, a
               counterfeit message is defined as any message entered using
               another person's name, handle or node address with the
               intent of deceiving others about the true author of the
               message.  No handles shall be used to enter messages to
               knowingly provoke, inflame, or upset participants in a
               conference with the purpose of deceiving others about the
               true identity of the author.

           10. SYSOP'S RESPONSIBILITY:  It is the responsibility of each
               Sysop to make every reasonable effort to assure that the
               users on his board conform to the provisions of this policy
               document.  A Sysop may be held responsible for the acts of
               his users unless the Sysop can show that a reasonable
               attempt was made to conform to this policy document.

           11. ECHOMAIL SOFTWARE:  Echomail software which does not conform
               to the minimum acceptable standards as defined by the
               Fidonet Technical Standards Committee (FTSC) shall lead to
               disciplinary action as described previously in this
               document.

           12. HOST ROUTING OF ECHOMAIL:  Host routing of Echomail without
               the prior consent of both the Sending and Receiving Hosts
               shall lead to disciplinary action as described previously in
               this document.  See Section III.

           13. INTER-NETWORK CONFERENCES:  It is the general policy of
               Fidonet to encourage the development of INTER-NETWORK
               CONFERENCES.  It shall be the duty of those providing the
               INTER-NETWORK CONFERENCE links to remove foreign net
               distribution identifiers which will adversely effect the
               distribution of the Echomail Conference while in Fidonet.
               The INTER-NETWORK CONFERENCE links maintained in Fidonet
               shall be operated in a manner not to interfere with the
               foreign network's distribution of Echomail. INTER-NETWORK
               CONFERENCE links maintained in FidoNet must also conform to
               General FidoNet Policy.

           14. DEFAMATORY POSTING:  The posting of any DEFAMATORY MESSAGE
               other than in conferences dedicated to this purpose (i.e.
               FLAME) shall lead to disciplinary action as described
               previously in this document.  See Section III.  The posting
               of substantiated facts shall not be considered a violation
               under this section.

           15. ADDING OR REMOVING CONFERENCES FROM THE Backbone: A
     FIDONEWS 14-27               Page 23                   7 Jul 1997


               conference may be added to the Backbone only at the request
               of the RECOGNIZED Conference Moderator.  A conference must
               be registered with the Echolist Coordinator before it can be
               added to the Backbone.

               A conference may be removed from the Backbone by lack of
               traffic.  A committee composed of the ZEC and 4 RECs shall
               review the status of backbone echos every 3 months.  At
               which time those echos which have not maintained a minimum
               10 messages a week over the preceding 3 months will be noted
               and their Conference moderators will be contacted.  These
               conferences will be given 1 months to improve their traffic
               or be withdrawn from Fidonet backbone distribution.  The
               recognized conference moderator may request removal of their
               conference from the Fidonet backbone distribution at their
               discretion.

           16. TOPOLOGY and DUPLICATE MESSAGES: Cross Regional links should
               be avoided as they increase the risk of improper linking and
               generation of duplicate messages.  Cross Regional links may
               only be established with the knowledge of the REC in both
               regions.  The REC must be notified prior to or at the time
               of the link being established.  If an REC determines that a
               cross regional link is contributing to the creation of
               duplicate messages, the REC may request that the link be
               terminated.

               The use of the PATHline option is required for all out of
               region links.

               If a sysop has a prior history of creating duplicate
               messages because of out of region links, the REC may require
               prior notification and approval before an out of region link
               can be established.

               Cross Regional links are permitted without notification if
               one of those systems is a dead-end.  Should the status of
               this link change, then notification is required.

               Each REC will do their best to make available high speed
               hubs, out of state hubs, PC Pursuit hubs, etc., to
               facilitate the low cost, efficient movement of mail within
               their respective Region.

               Any Sysop who willfully and knowingly establishes links that
               either create duplicate loops (topology that creates
               circular feeds) or who refuses to break such links upon
               request by their NEC, REC, or ZEC shall be subject to
               disciplinary action as described previously in this
               document.  See Section III.

           17. MESSAGE STANDARDS:  Until the adoption of a superseding
               standard by the Fidonet Technical Standards Committee, the
               following Echomail message standards are recommended:

                    a)   Eight-bit characters (ASCII 128-255) and non-
     FIDONEWS 14-27               Page 24                   7 Jul 1997


                    printing low-order codes (ASCII 2-31) are prohibited,
                    except the use of 8Dh (soft <CR> character) per FTS-
                    0004.  This is not intended to discourage participation
                    of foreign zones or networks, which may permit said
                    characters.  Any echomail processor should pass
                    information exactly as it was received, without
                    stripping any non-standard characters.

                    b)   Origin lines should be limited to 79 characters
                    including the required ending of a proper network
                    address (i.e. Zone:Net/Node.Point with zone and point
                    being optional).

                    c)   Tear lines should be limited  to 35 characters
                    including the required "---" lead-in.  These should
                    only contain packer or editor program identification.
                    Tear lines for message editors are discouraged.  If an
                    editor adds a tear line, it should also add an origin
                    line to avoid multiple tear lines.

                    d)   "Extra" origin lines (ZoneGating) are limited to
                    essential information  only.  This consists of the
                    required lead-in plus the network name "Gateway" and
                    optionally the software ID followed by a Zone:Net/Node
                    address.

                      Example:

                       " * Origin: FidoNet Gateway (TComm 88:372/666)"

                    e)   SEEN-BY addresses should be in sorted order.
                    Multiple AKA's are not allowed in SEEN-BY lines unless
                    you have more than one address which processes mail.
                    Or for one month during change of an existing address
                    (to avoid duplicates to the previous address).  Node 0
                    addresses should not be used for echomail distribution.

                    f)   All current FTSC specifications must be followed.


       VI.  ENFORCEMENT

               Enforcement of this policy document shall be under the
               provisions of General FidoNet policy.  Complaints concerning
               Echomail violations defined under this policy may be filed
               by the aggrieved individual, the conference moderator or by
               any level of Echomail Coordinator to the appropriate *C
               level.  All complaints made pursuant to this policy must be
               made within 60 days of the date of occurrence or discovery.
               Complaints shall be filed under the provisions of General
               Fidonet Policy, with a copy to the respective *EC.

               Enforcement is immediate, with any currently existing
               software allowed 60 days to conform (from the date EchoPol1
               goes into effect).  A 30-day extension may be granted solely
               at the discretion of the ZEC if efforts to bring about
     FIDONEWS 14-27               Page 25                   7 Jul 1997


               compliance are clear.  Continued use of aberrant software
               after this period shall be deemed excessively annoying.


       VII.  ADOPTION OF POLICY

            1. ADOPTION:  This policy shall become effective upon
               ratification by a simple majority of those voting.  Those
               eligible to vote shall be the IC, ZCs, RCs, NCs, ZECs, RECs,
               and NECs.  Those individuals holding more than one position
               can cast only one vote.

            2. GRANDFATHER CLAUSE:  Within 60 days of adoption of this
               policy, moderators shall be appointed for all existing
               Echomail Conferences which do not now have a moderator.
               Moderators shall be appointed by the ZEC from those
               volunteering as moderator or if no volunteer is available
               then the ZEC shall request and appoint a moderator for the
               conference.  In the case where more than one individual
               claims to be the conference moderator and no agreement can
               be reached, the ZEC may order the conference retired and ban
               the further use of the specific conference name.  Failure of
               the individuals to retire the conference name shall be
               deemed excessively annoying behavior.


       VI.  BACKBONE STRUCTURE

               This section is for information purposes only.  It gives a
               plain English description of the current structure and
               operation of the Backbone.  The ZEC may change this
               structure without amending this document.

               At the top of the Echomail distribution network, there are
               systems commonly called Stars.  These systems are usually
               dedicated to passing Echomail.  The stars operate at the
               discretion and direction of the ZEC.  At the time of this
               writing there are 3 stars, each has a backup system/plan in
               the event of a failure.  In general, the Stars link to one
               another and feed the RECs.

               The RECs are then responsible for distribution of the
               echomail within their  Region.  Normally, the REC will feed
               the NECs in that region.

               The NEC is responsible for distribution of Echomail to the
               individual Sysops within a net.

               Note that the RECs and NECs can appoint Hubs to help in the
               distribution of Echomail.  That is, they do not have to
               directly feed the lower level.

               This is the distribution GOAL.  Because of less expensive
               phone rates and other reasons, this distribution method is
               not followed exactly.  Any change to the above requires
               agreement of the *EC's involved.  All *ECs will use all the
     FIDONEWS 14-27               Page 26                   7 Jul 1997


               tools at their disposal, such as hubs, high speed modems,
               ROA, Wide Area Calling plans, PC Pursuit, corporate
               sponsorship, etc., to provide fast, efficient, and cost
               effective movement of echomail.

     No more "Getting technical" ?
     by Frank Ellermann, 2:240/5815.1

     I hate the idea, that now after all old FTSC documents the "Getting
     technical" corner could vanish from FidoNews. And there are lots of
     other interesting technical documents, which should be part of the
     FTSC library. So when my time allows it, I'll submit some texts I'm
     aware of. The first one is easy, a FSC proposal lost somewhere in
     cyber space between David Nugent and me... Fortunately, because here
     is the newest third edition: Z2C approved X2C and X2S as user flags in
     zone 2... :-)

        Zone 2 nodelist flags
        Frank Ellermann, 2:240/5815.1

        Introduction
        ------------
        This document informs about known differences of FidoNet zone 2
        nodelist flags from FTS-0005.003.  The ultimate sources for these
        informations are the current zone 2 nodelist epilog and the setup
        for flag corrections at Z2C, but it may be difficult to get these
        sources for readers in other zones.

        FTS-0005 flags
        --------------
        The following flags are used as specified in FTS-0005.003:

             CM      Node accepts mail 24 hours a day
             MO      Node does not accept human callers
             LO      Node accepts calls only from valid listed node numbers
                     in the current FidoNet nodelist

             V21     ITU-T V21      300 bps full duplex
             V22     ITU-T V22     1200 bps full duplex

        In zone 2 a value of 1200 in the former "baud rate" field implies
        V22.  Today only two nodes not supporting at least V22bis or ISDN
        still exist in the zone 2 segment, therefore the flags V21 and V22
        are obsolescent.  Both flags should be dropped from FTS-0005.

             V29     ITU-T V29     9600 bps half duplex
             V33     ITU-T V33

        V33 cannot be used in connecting Fido nodes over public dial-up
        lines and is most probably a historical error in FTS-0005.  This
        flag should be removed from FTS-0005 a.s.a.p.  A similar argument
        is applicable on V29, and few nodes flagging V29 today all support
     FIDONEWS 14-27               Page 28                   7 Jul 1997


        at least V32.  The next version of FTS-0005 should drop V29.

             V32     ITU-T V32     9600 bps full duplex
        ->   V32B    ITU-T V32bis 14400 bps full duplex (implies V32)
             V34     ITU-T V34    28800 bps full duplex

        FTS-0005 specifies V32b and V42b (capital V and small b), current
        nodelist practice in FidoNet shows all combinations of small and
        capital letters for flags.  This was no problem before FSC-0062
        introduced case-sensitive flags.  In zone 2 all old flags except
        from FSC-0062 flags are upper case, and a NODEDIFF changing this
        convention would be annoying.  The best solution is to stick to the
        current practice and treat all old flags as case-insensitive.

             H96     Hayes V9600
             HST     USR Courier HST up to 9600  (implies MNP)
             H14     USR Courier HST up to 14400 (implies HST)
        ->   H16     USR Courier HST up to 16800 (implies H14 and V42B)
             MAX     Microcom AX/96xx series
             PEP     Packet Ensemble Protocol
             CSP     Compucom Speedmodem
        ->   ZYX     Zyxel series 16800 bps (implies V32B and V42B)
        ->   V32T    V.32 Terbo   19200 bps (implies V32B)
             VFC     V.Fast Class 28800 bps

        If a flag directly or indirectly implies other flags, then these
        other flags are not shown in a nodelist entry, because this would
        be redundant.  Unfortunately the rules for redundancies in zone 2
        and FTS-0005 are different.  Zone 2 continued to avoid redundancy
        with most "new" flags, but FTS-0005.003 specified no redundancies
        for "new" flags like ZYX, H16, V32T, or VFC.  "New" flags in this
        context are flags approved by FidoNet International Coordinators
        since 1989, when FTS-0005.TXT, the predecessor of FTS-0005.003, was
        published.

        For details see the chapter "implications" below, for now only
        note, that in zone 2 H16 implies V42B, ZYX implies V32B and V42B,
        and V32T implies V32B.

        Zone 1 and zone 2 have introduced a user flag Z19 approved by the
        corresponding Zone Coordinator.  User flags are discussed later,
        for now only note, that in zone 2 ZYX is specified as Zyxel 16k8,
        while FTS-0005.003 not knowing Z19 specifies ZYX as generic flag
        for all Zyxel protocol speeds.

     |  Today there is no more node in FidoNet still flagging MAX, this
        flag is obsolete and should be dropped from FTS-0005. The flags
        HST, H14, and CSP should be marked as obsolescent.

        ->   V42B    ITU-T LAP-M error correction w/fallback to MNP 1-5

        As mentioned above FTS-0005 specifies V42b (capital V, small b).
        In zone 2 all case-insensitive flags are listed in upper case.

     FIDONEWS 14-27               Page 29                   7 Jul 1997


        The next version of FTS-0005 will probably adopt the better V42B
        and MNP definitions of the zone 3 nodelist epilog.  FTS-0005.003
        specifies an implication of V42 by V42B, but the exact meaning of
        the flag MNP is unclear.  Most probably this flag was meant to
        indicate support of MNP 1-4, and in this sense V42B implies MNP:

             MNP     Microcom Networking Protocol 1-4 error correction
             V42     ITU-T LAP-M error correction w/fallback to MNP 1-4
             V42B    ITU-T V.42 LAP-M plus V.42bis BTLZ data compression

        In zone 2 MNP is considered as redundant, if V42B is flagged or
        implied by other flags like H16, ZYX, or Z19.

             XW      WaZOO file requests
             XX      WaZOO file/update requests

        These flags are equivalent in FTS-0005 and in the zone 2 segment.

             Gx..x   Gateway to domain 'x..x'

        Valid values for this flag are assigned by the Fido International
        Coordinator, FTS-0005.003 explicitly mentions GUUCP.  In zone 2
        only GUUCP gateways are flagged.

             #02     Zone 2 mail hour (02:30 - 03:30 UTC) w/ Bell 212A
        ->   #08     Zone 4 mail hour (08:00 - 09:00 UTC) w/ Bell 212A
             #09     Zone 1 mail hour (09:00 - 10:00 UTC) w/ Bell 212A
             #18     Zone 3 mail hour (18:00 - 19:00 UTC) w/ Bell 212A
             #20     Zone 6 mail hour (20:00 - 21:00 UTC) w/ Bell 212A

        The variants !01, !02, !08, !09, !18, and !20 indicate missing Bell
        212A support.  In zone 2 #02 or !02 would be obviously redundant.

        Today less than five 1200 modems (V22 or Bell 212A) are listed.
        A future version of FTS-0005 should drop !mn variants together with
        V21 and V22 flags.

        Further most non-CM systems flagging #mn or !mn today probably want
        to show additional online times instead of additional mail hours.
        As soon as FSC-0062 flags have been approved by the IC or adopted
        as FTS by the FTSC, the following version of FTS-0005 should mark
        #mn as obsolescent and recommend the more flexible FSC-0062 flags
        (see below).

        User flags
        ----------
        An example for one of several problems in zone 2 with user flags:

     FIDONEWS 14-27               Page 30                   7 Jul 1997


             ...,U,Z19,V110H,V120L,V120H,X75,ENC,NEC

        These flags indicate a modern Zyxel ISDN-modem and two additional
        user flags ENC and NEC.  This possible user flags string contains
        34 characters, but at most 32 characters are allowed in FTS-0005.

             ...,U,Z19,V110L,V110H,X75,ISDNA,ISDNB,ISDNC

        During the period for the replacement of old by new ISDN flags
        (several months !) many nodes listed both old and new flags for
        maximal compatibility, and no problems with nodelist compilers
        or mailers caused by too long user flags strings were reported.

        Therefore the length limit in FTS-0005 is probably unnecessary
        and at least inconsequent:  Other nodelist fields like the system
        name are unlimited, so why only restrict the user flags string?  To
        help developers an upper limit of e.g. 255 characters for a
        nodelist line and 63 characters for fields 3 to 6 would be more
        useful.

        The next problem with user flag strings as specified in FTS-0005 is
        their introduction by the letter U with no comma following:

        Nodelist compilers could parse ...,UISDN,USR in user flags ISDN and
        USR.  But USR cannot be approved as "real" flag, because the
        combination ...,USR,UISDN would then be parsed in SR and UISDN.

        Other side effects of the FTS-0005 specification are additional
        difficulties in finding flags.  Almost all flags are separated by a
        comma, only the first user flag can be an exception to this simple
        rule.  If the order of user flags has no meaning, then...

             ...,UV120L,V120H
             ...,UV120H,V120L

        ... are equivalent.  A "simple" solution of this problem could be
        to treat UV120L as synonym for V120L, and UV120H as synonym for
        V120H.  Similar problems show up, if user flags are counted, etc.

        Obviously a nodelist compiler looking for user flags has always to
        consider the case "user flag separated by comma".  In zone 2 this
        idea was simply extended to the first user flag:

        All flags are separated by commas.  Flags not yet approved by the
        International Coordinator or the FTSC (i.e. user flags only used
        experimentally or locally) are separated by a new pseudo flag U.

        ->   U       pseudo flag to the left of at least one user flag

        All flags following this pseudo flag U are user flags, all flags
        before this pseudo flag are "real" flags specified in FTS-0005 or
        approved by the International Coordinator.

        Because this definition should be compatible with any reasonable
        software implementation based on FTS-0005.003, and simplifies the
        handling of user flags significantly, a future FTS-0005 version
     FIDONEWS 14-27               Page 31                   7 Jul 1997


        will hopefully adopt it.

        Approved zone 2 user flags
        --------------------------
        In zone 2 user flags have to be approved by the Zone Coordinator.
        Currently the following zone 2 user flags exist:

        ->   V110L   ITU-T V.110 19k2 async 'Low'    (former ISDNA)
        ->   V110H   ITU-T V.110 38k4 async 'High'   (former ISDNB)
        ->   V120L   ITU-T V.120 56k6 async, N1 = 259, W = 7, modulo 8
        ->   V120H   ITU-T V.120 64k  async, N1 = 259, W = 7, modulo 8
        ->   X75     ITU-T X.75 SLP (single link procedure),
                     64kbit/s B channel; layer 2 max. framesize N1 = 2048,
                     window size W = 2, frame numbering modulo 8;
                     layer 3 transparent (no packet layer)
        ->   ISDN    Other configuration, used only if none of above fits

        These ISDN flags follow the specification in FSC-0091.

        ->   Tyz     Online time flags as specified in FSC-0062

        The flag Tyz is used by non-CM nodes online not only during ZMH,
        y is a letter indicating the start and z a letter indicating the
        end of the online period as defined below (times in UTC):

             A  0:00,  a  0:30,   B  1:00,  b  1:30,   C  2:00,  c  2:30,
             D  3:00,  d  3:30,   E  4:00,  e  4:30,   F  5:00,  f  5:30,
             G  6:00,  g  6:30,   H  7:00,  h  7:30,   I  8:00,  i  8:30,
             J  9:00,  j  9:30,   K 10:00,  k 10:30,   L 11:00,  l 11:30,
             M 12:00,  m 12:30,   N 13:00,  n 13:30,   O 14:00,  o 14:30,
             P 15:00,  p 15:30,   Q 16:00,  q 16:30,   R 17:00,  r 17:30,
             S 18:00,  s 18:30,   T 19:00,  t 19:30,   U 20:00,  u 20:30,
             V 21:00,  v 21:30,   W 20:00,  w 20:30,   X 23:00,  x 23:30.

        For example TuB shows an online period from 20:30 until 1:00 UTC.

        ->   Z19     Zyxel series 19200 bps (implies ZYX)
        ->   X2C     x2 client w/ 56000 bps (should imply V34 and V42B)
        ->   X2S     x2 server w/ 56000 bps (should imply V34 and V42B)

        ->   K12     Systems offering all educational K12-conferences
        ->   ENC     The node accepts inbound encrypted mail

        ->   NC      Network Coordinator (only if the NC is not the host)
        ->   NEC     Net Echomail Coordinator    (at most one per net)
        ->   REC     Region Echomail Coordinator (at most one per region)
        ->   ZEC     Zone Echomail Coordinator   (at most one per zone)

        Redundant AKAs used to indicate echomail coordination in zone 2 are
        no longer permitted.  One *EC flag is valid for all AKAs of a given
        sysop.

        Flag implications
        -----------------
        Flag implications directly or indirectly specified in FTS-0005:

     FIDONEWS 14-27               Page 32                   7 Jul 1997


             HST     => MNP
             H14     => MNP HST
             H16     => MNP HST H14
             V42b    => V42 (MNP ?)
             V32b    => V32

        Flag implications specified in the zone 2 nodelist epilog:

             HST     => MNP
             H14     => HST MNP
        ->   H16     => V42 MNP V42B H14 HST
        ->   V42B    => V42 MNP
        ->   ZYX     => V42 MNP V42B V32B
        ->   Z19     => V42 MNP V42B V32B ZYX
             V32B    => V32
        ->   V32T    => V32 V32B

        ->   V110L   => ISDN
        ->   V110H   => ISDN
        ->   V120L   => ISDN
        ->   V120H   => ISDN
        ->   X75     => ISDN

        The latter ISDN flag redundancies are a consequence of FSC-0091.
     |  Maybe some of the following implications could be added in zone 2:

             VFC     => V32 V32B
     |   or  VFC     => V32 V32B MNP V42 V42B
     |       X2C     => V34
     |   or  X2C     => V34 MNP V42 V42B
     |       X2S     => V34
     |   or  X2S     => V34 MNP V42 V42B

        Flag implications (i.e. not listing redundant flags) have several
        advantages:  Some old nodelist tools are unable to handle too long
        lines.  Old flags like HST, MNP, V42, or V32 vanish automatically,
        if they are implied by H16, V42B, V32B, or better.  Redundancies
        defined globally for the whole nodelist help to avoid flag errors.

        "Baud rate" field
        -----------------
        The former "baud rate" field 7 in the nodelist as specified in FTS-
        0005 is nearly useless today:  Except from a few remaining 1200 and
        2400 nodes almost all nodelist entries show either 9600 for all
        modem protocols better than V22bis or 300 for ISDN only nodes.  No
        more V21 or Bell 103 modems are listed today.

        Obscure "baud rate" values 19200 and 38400 specified in FTS-0005
        have not been used in the FidoNet nodelist.  So all a reasonable
        nodelist compiler can do today, is treat 300 as indicator for ISDN
        only, and treat unknown or missing values in field 7 like 9600.

        A new meaning for field 7 as speed field could be really useful.
        An example is ZYX, if we would have 16800, 19200, 28800, and 33600
        as speed values, then their combination with ZYX is all we need
        technically, Z19 would be unnecessary.  Another example is HST,
     FIDONEWS 14-27               Page 33                   7 Jul 1997


        flags H14 and H16 are unnecessary, if HST is combined with 9600,
        14400, 16800, 28800, or 33600.  Variants of PEP could be shown in
        the speed field without new flags.  "Enhanced V32.terbo" could be
        shown by 21600.

        Most important:  V34 may have the famous bug not allowing connects
        from new "V34+", unless the caller disabled symbol rate 3429.  If
        "V34+" is indicated by speed 33600, then an appropriate setup for
        all kinds of V34 connects is possible.

        A future version of FTS-0005 hopefully allows the following speed
        values in field 7:

               300   reserved for ISDN only (for historical reasons)
              1200   V22 or Bell 212A (obsolete)
              2400   implies V22bis
              9600   default, used with V32, HST, H96, PEP, CSP
             12000   rare variant of V32
             14400   used with V32b or HST (obsoleting H14)
             16800   used with ZYX  or HST (obsoleting H16)
             19200   used with V32T or ZYX (obsoleting Z19)
             21600   rare variant of V32T (no "H21" needed)
             28800   used with VFC or V34
             33600   used with V34 (no V34+ or V34b needed)
     |       56000   used with X2C, X2S, or "K56FLEX"

        The following values should be specified in FTS-0005, because they
        are already used in nodelists of other FTNs:

             empty   no value, useful for Pvt nodes or in point lists
             19200   used with V110L, V32T, or ZYX (obsoleting Z19)
             38400   used with V110H
     |       56000   used with V120L, X2C, X2S, or "K56FLEX"
     |       64000   used with V120H, X75, X2S, or other ISDN equipment

        Allowing more than 12 speed values or allowing ISDN speeds could
        break old software.  Therefore the transition could be done in two
        steps, first add all non-ISDN speeds (ISDN only shown as 300).

        Later remove 300 (ISDN only) and 1200 (obsolete) replacing 300 by
        19200, 38400, 56000, or 64000.

     Due to the proximity of my vacation, the July issue of the Elist will
     be dropped.  The next regular issue will be 01 August 1997.  My
     apologies for the inconvenience.

     =================================================================


     Don't risk being banned! Use FIDOTEST.

     Almost ALL other echoes FORBID posting TEST messages.  Where do you
     and your users send test' posts to ensure they are leaving your
     system?  Which Backboned echo can you use to ensure your posts are
     reaching the far corners of Z1, or to see if upstream/downstream
     systems are wrecking or loosing your message?

     Why not a specific echo devoted to testing echomail links?

     There is one!  If you believe it to be beneficial for the Fidonet
     community to have a _dedicated_ and _authorized_ echo for testing,
     be sure to ask your REC to ensure that

             FIDOTEST -

             the Fidonet TEST echo and malfunction conference gets
             Z1-Backboned.

     For your edification, the complete echo rules follow:

     Remember: only YOU can make sure your REC knows your position
     on the backboning of FIDOTEST.  Netmail him today, because
     without your help, tomorrow's Fidonet may never arrive.
