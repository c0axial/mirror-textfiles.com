                            HOT NEWS

                Happy holidays and all that stuff ... at least
        FidoNet is so far pretty immune to overdose advertising!

                This is the fourth issue of FidoNews, and it is
        finally taking shape. Send articles on any subject, please
                Bumper stickers will be ready in Jan. They will be
        cheap, and totally meaningless to those unfamiliar with the
        little doggie. I'll take a dozen.

                If you are reading this (? pointless and
        paradoxical, but grammatically correct recursive, followed
        by a note referencing the phrase and the note itself ...
        never mind, it's late) you are are part of FidoNet, so
        please send articles!

                The first intercontinental FidoNet message was sent
        from Jakarta Indonesia (Fido #117, Jim Filgo) to St. Louis
        (Fido #51). It may have been routed through Maui, Hawaii, I
        don't know, I get everything second hand. See the article
        below.

                Fido is now running on the Sanyo 555, and the TI
        Professional version is being tested. The Sanyo version
        isn't released yet, it's awaiting testing on other MSDOS
        versions available for the Sanyo. (The MSDOS implementation
        from Sanyo is so bad, there are aftermarket versions!) In
        any case, it cannot be downloaded from Fido #1 until I get
        it replaced. (Dead disk drive.)


                Note that last weeks FIDOLIST is included this
        issue; my single floppy filled up while receiveing the
        latest mailed from St. Louis, and I didn't get a chance to
        get a new copy. Next issue will have the latest, I promise.
        (Unless I still haven't replaced my broken machine, and the

                        EUROPEAN FIDO

                There are nodes in England, one or two in Japan, and
        some raring to go guys in Sweden that should be up soon.
        There are three main problems in FidoNetting across the
        oceans; modem compatibility, extreme time differences, and
        cost.

                Modem compatibility may be fixed by sticking to Bell
        103A 300 baud (what the Hayes, etc does). The time
        differences can be handled easily with two schedules; at a
        convenient time (for Europe) mail is sent from Europe to the
        US; at a convenient time (for the US, probably around the
        current 1:00 AM) mail is sent to Europe, who runs receive-
        only. The times are chosen for the lowest cost for the
        sender.

                Cost ... well, no way around that, though with the
        extreme connect charges (I'd guess $1.00 to $3.00 per
        minute) FidoNet will be much cheaper than calling direct! If
        the optimum four or five messages were sent at once, the
        cost would be about 60 cents max, not bad for an overnight
        intercontinental letter ...

        IBM Software Digest                Allen Miller Fido 85
        -------------------------------------------------------

        Fido 85, Allen's BOARD, in Cincinnati is an IBM based
        Fido, interested in public domain software of all
        types.  I have amassed a fair collection of software
        over the last 2 years, but I am always interested in
        knowing what new and useful programs are being
        developed.

        I will provide the support effort in two areas for
        those of you that are interested in participating in
        an experiment.  The two areas are:








fidonews.man --           24 Dec 84  22:46:48           Page 4

           1. Compile a list of Fido's that are IBM.
           This will be useful to Fido's that are IBM
           since there is currently no way of knowing
           which Fido's share your interests.

           2. Act as clearing house for a 'national'
           collection and catalogue of IBM personal
           computer software.  All the IBM Sysops can
           contribute and I will compile and organize
           their program contributions and
           comments/descriptions.

        If you think you are interested, send me a FidoNet mail
        message saying you want to participate and stating any
        particular categories of software you are interested in
        (C, graphics, assembler, etc.).  I will assemble a list
        of the people that respond and distribute the list to
        all of you.  You can use this list to streamline your
        searching for software in the future.

        If you want to participate in phase #2, send me a few
        of your favorite programs with good comments if they
        are not thoroughly documented.  I will compile a
        library and listing and make it available to you.

        If you have any additional suggestions, please let me
        know.

        -------------------------------------------------------
        Dallas, Texas (FNM) - A Dallas-area Fido sysop has taken Tom
        Tcmpidis' dilemma to heart.  After reading a FidoNews
        article describing the continuing plight of Mr. Tcmpidis,
        the realization that "open" bulletin board systems can be an
        invitation to would-be software pirates and other
        traffickers in illegal information led him to implement a
        security system to ensure that callers to this particular
        board were not "perfect strangers." 

        The means of "getting to know your callers" already exists
        within the current release of the Fido software, with the
        ability of Fido to screen callers who do not yet have a
        valid password, and to request information from new callers
        prior to the granting of full access to the features of the
        board.  This is described in "Fido's Operating Manual,"
        release 10, as the Private Message System.

        Most Fido sysops are aware that the capability for
        generating a "private" system exist, by simply adding the
        "/M" flag to the command line that starts the Fido software. 
        However

        the original file!]

        Users tend to think of FidoNet nodes in terms of location
        rather than node numbers. It is convenient to maintain and
        distribute NODELIST in node number sequence, but this is
        awkward at best for our users.
         
        On Fido 51, once the node list has been edited for Fido
        consumption, I run the following batch file against it:

                SORT <NODELIST.BBS >NODELIST.TMP /+55
                SORT <NODELIST.TMP >NODELIST.BBS /+69
                DEL NODELIST.TMP

        The first (minor) sort orders the node list by city. The
        second (major) sort orders by state and city within state.
        This is far more useful to a user who wants to send a message
        to someone in Podunk Idaho, but can't think of the node 
        number.

        One added step may be beneficial. The sort should group
        the local nodes together. You may want to use your editor to
        move them to the front of the file.

        Remote Contol of Fido              Allen Miller Fido 85

        I run a Fido system at my office and also have a PC at
        home.  It has been very frustrating when I wanted to
        dial up my own Fido system from home and could not get
        through.

        There is a now device on the market that will enable
        you to take control of your system, from a remote
        location, even if a user has it tied up. This device is
        referred to as the BSR SYSTEM X-10, marketed by Radio
        Shack, Sears, and I suppose others.  The system
        consists of a control module that plugs into the house
        circuit and small modules that go between wall plugs
        and appliances.  Through the house current, the control
        module is able to switch the appliance modules off or
        on.

        One of the different control modules that are available
        has the added function of being able to 'answer' the
        phone and respond to a hand held remote transmitter
        tone generator.  So, if you have an extra phone line at
        the Fido location and one of these devices set up, you
        can call the control module when the Fido line is busy
        and 1) turn the modem off and back on or 2) reboot the
        system.  Once you have done this, it should be easy to
        get through to your system.

        Cost of the control module is about $50 and the
        appliance module is $10-$15.

                                 FOOD FOR THOUGHT
                                Ben Baker - Fido 10

        I recently called AT&T to inquire about the cost of inward WATS
        service, and was astounded by the result.  A 2-line nationwide
        inward WATS line in Missouri or Illinois would incur these charges:

                One-time installation                   $367
                Monthly access charge (both lines)       $75
                Connect charges (11PM-8AM)
                        6 second increments               $5.40/hr

        Let's say we had a "national Fido" supported by a network of 50 of
        the more than 100 current Fidos. What would it cost per board?

                One-time installation                    $7.33
                Monthly access charge (both lines)       $1.50
                Connect charges (11PM-8AM)
                        6 second increments              $5.40/hr

        I have talked with TJ about this. (It was his suggestion I write
        this.) He would be willing to make the necessary changes to Fido
        to support this concept. A using Fido would call the 800 number with
        FidoNet and deposit out-going and pick up in-coming mail. Two calls
        per night would guarentee overnight service in both directions,
        however the Sysop of a low-traffic board might elect to call only
        once a week.

        Charges could be arranged so that the sending node paid for both
        legs of the transfer.  Lets say a board averages 20 out-going 
        messages per week at an average of 18 seconds transmission time
        per message. His average monthly charge would be:
         
                Access                          1.50
                Connect                         1.08

                Total                           2.58

                Cost/Message                    0.13

        The more messages you send, the less the per message cost. The more
        participating Fidos, the less the fixed cost per Fido and the less
        per message costs. For instance, with 100 nodes participating and 50
        messages per month the costs would be:

                Access                          0.75
                Connect                         2.70

                Total                           3.45

                Cost/Message                    0.07

        The first per message cost above is competetive with any available
        alternate method of sending FidoNet mail. You can't beat the second
        per message cost with a stick!

        There are nine hours a night plus all day Saturday and much of

        Sunday available at this rate.  If this board operated two 1-hour
        mail schedules each night that would leave a lot of hours that it
        could be operated as a national Sysops only Fido Board, with connect
        charges lower than CompuServe's!

        I am not prepared to say at this time that we will do this, but
        it is certainly inviting to think about.  I do solicit your responses
        on the subject.  Please send all comments via FidoNet mail to
        Ben Baker, Fido 10.  Include suggestions, constructive criticism, 
        willingness or unwillingness to participate, etc..

        Oh, by the way -- Happy Holidays!

                              Messages as Attached Files
                                by Ben Baker - Fido 10

        It is sometimes convenient to mail a message from one Fido to another
        as an attached file.  For instance, lets say that one of my users
        leaves a messae to Sysop with a good suggestion for a change to Fido.
        I'm in no position to make changes to Fido, but Tom Jennings is.

        However, Tom hasn't logged onto my board since last May and I have
        no reason to believe he will do so any time soon.  I have three
        options.  I can send a message to Tom, carefully relating the 
        suggestion (42 lines or so), I can ignore it altogether or I can send
        Tom the original message as an attached file.

        The latter is the best choice for me, but when he gets it, how does
        Tom read the message?  It's not clear text, and only Fido or another
        program that understands message structures can read it easily.
        Since Fido is already written it's the obvious candidate, but the 
        message must be in a message area for Fido to read it and it is in
        the mail files area.

        I solved this dilemma on Fido 10 by creating a new area with Sysop only
        priveledges.  In it both the message and the files paths point to the
        FidoMail files area.  If someone sends me a file, I can preview it in
        this area before making it available in another area for my users.
        If the file happens to be of the form nn.MSG, it is a message and I can
        read it in the message section in this special area.

        It's simple and direct, but very useful when you recieve messages as
        files.
