Editorial: oops

by Tom Jennings (1:1/1)

Oh well, nothing like inventing everything as you go...

To get to the point: an article a few weeks ago by Ann Ioannides
complaining of problems should not have been published. I apologize to
everyone involved. I owe Dave Rawson (102/34, moderator INTERUSER)
especially an apology.

Two things result.

One -- this problem happened, besides my not looking more carefully at
the particular article at hand (see below) partly because of the
process, or lack thereof, in dealing with these sorta things.

Two -- this particular thing won't happen again, because I am adding
more rules to FidoNews article submission:

... when an article accuses anyone of wrongdoing, or other somesuch
type thing, I will inform the author that I will send a copy of the
article to all referenced people, and await there reply (or a
reasonable interval and attempts to contact), and,

... FidoNews will not run personal attacks as articles, period.

The astute observer will notice (I did, just now) that many if not
most of the ahem problems with FidoNews content are this sort of
thing, one way or another.

Oh well. Now we know. I told Dave Rawson I will allow them to get in
the last word.

                        * * * * *

The only thing I'll say in my defense is the following:

I was told I should research submissions before publishing them (see
related item, below). My response is, flatly impossible. I am editor,
and publisher, not author. While I do have an overall responsibility
for content, duly acknowledged, I do not make this stuff up. Now if I
knowingly take part in false or damaging content, it's another story.

I wanted to keep FidoNews an wide-open medium for publishing
"anything". It looks more and more like this is flatly impossible.
Before you write in those "I told you so"'s, I'll reiterate that I
want to keep all changes to FidoNews public and open and in response
to some particular need, rather than merely the whim of some know-it-
all, as is so often the case in FidoNet. Mistakes get made, and I
really am truly sorry for Dave and everyone in INTERUSER.

                        * * * * *

And I received this interesting comment in netmail this past week.
It's related, tangentially at the least, and raises yet another
possible question. I'll mark items in the text with [x].

Subj: Question

You published an article in FidoNews by a NON-FidoNet member
using someone else's valid FidoNet address. Is this ok? [a]

Would you please clarify "published weekly by and for the Members of
the FidoNet International amateur network" as it appears in FidoNews?
[b]

Does this include material by and for members and NOT include a bbs
USER's comments or article?  If open to all for their views, (FidoNet
members as well as anyone else as long as a valid node number is
used), then perhaps I misunderstood.

I thought only actual FidoNet members have the privilege of having
their comments and articles published in your excellent publication.
[c]

Thank you.

First, thanks for the well thought out message!

[a] I don't know which article you are referring to, but I don't think
it matters. Presumably it was a user of that BBS. Presumably that
person had access (ie. permission) from the sysop. Contextual
assumptions (does this user represent that BBS; does the sysop
represent a BBS; etc) depend on answers to your other questions.

[b] Personally, I take "members of..." to include, yes, users. At
various times, for various purposes. I don't recall it ever coming up,
and I think it's safe to say over 90% of FidoNews is from sysops, and
the user-generated content is in general equally as pertinent. There
has been stuff from non-BBS/non-FidoNet and even non-telecomm. people
as well. I believe that this non-policy helps, not hinders, FidoNews,
though others may disagree, certainly!

[c] Depends on [b], I guess....


                        * * * * *

And last but definitely not least, one wonderful reader wrote to tell
us of a source of problem resolution available to echo users, which
I've included as an article in this issue. Thanks, Wilma, for taking
the trouble to write.

FidoNet echo help, guidance, etc...

Subj: Policy Echo

[...]
If you are wondering about an echo where anyone who is able to access
FidoNet echos can go and look for help/guidence/etc. it does exist
(almost 3 years old now). The name is NET-POL and it is on the
backbone. I don't claim we can solve all the problems in FidoNet, but
we (the echo) has been able to help quite a few FidoNet users with
various problems. The members of the echo range from very young bbs
callers to (last I knew) RC's, EC's and NC's, with everything in
between.

Aloha from Hawaii!
by  Lou Ludwig 1:345/20 and Pj Estes 1:345/10

  Did you know the single word, Aloha, means more than just hello or
good-bye?  It also means love, kindness, affection, or goodwill.  This
one word conveys the Hawaiian attitude better than any other I can
think of.

FidoNews 9-17                  Page 7                      27 Apr 1992


  Hawaii.  The state, the myths, the lifestyle, the people....

  Almost everyone dreams at one time or another of the beautiful
tropical setting of our 50th state. To some it's their dream vacation.
To others it's their dream of living here.  Yet others may just have a
curiosity of the history, culture, or tourist attractions which are so
abundant on the islands.

  Until I moved here my knowledge of Hawaii consisted of what I had
seen on TV or read in books.  Things like bits about the Pearl Harbor
attack, fantasy TV series such as Hawaii Five-O and Magnum PI, and the
glamour of the ads in travel brochures - Life in the fastlane...

  Oh Boy!  Was I ever in for a culture shock!  Although it wasn't
everything I had expected (Is it ever?), I'm not the least bit
dissapointed with my decision to move here.

  Hawaii has so much to offer.  We here on the islands would like to
share the "Spirit of Aloha" and information that we have found with
others, to help everyone become more aware of Hawaii and all it has to
offer.  Whether the topic is History, the Economy, Beaches, or anything
in-between, you're sure to find the answers here.

  Whatever your attraction to Hawaii is, you're sure to enjoy this
echo.  Why not join us and catch the "Aloha Spirit"?  Contact our NEC,
Bill Arrington at 1:345/7 for the "HAWAII" feed today!  He'll be more
than happy to hook ya up, and as soon as we can get enough people
involved we will be moving to the Backbone for distribution.  Aloha and
Mahalo.  Hope to see you all here soon.

A new echo has been created in Net 247 called DR_DOS.  This echo is
aimed towards users and SysOps who run DR-DOS, or are interested in
DR-DOS.

The echo is open to all who wish it.  The echo though will have to
be picked up from 247/99 since it is not on the backbone.  At least
not yet.

NETMail Cal Gardner, 1:247/99 to get hooked up.

Perot_92 Echo Started

We are pleased to announce the creation of PEROT_92, an echo devoted
to the discussion of H. Ross Perot's candidacy for the Presidency.

FidoNews 9-17                  Page 8                      27 Apr 1992


Distribution at this point is limited, but feeds can be arranged at
1:260/246 and 1:260/222. We assume other feeds will be available as
the echo, like Ross' campaign, grows.

(This echo is not affiliated with the official H. Ross Perot petition
drive. Yet.)

PEROT in 92!

"P_news" PROGRESSIVE News & Views


There are ALTERNATIVES. This is an echo conference for
articulating ideas that challenge prevailing views. Except for
"Anews" and very few others, there is a shortage of alternative
networks. BUT NOW, there is "progressive" news, views & poetry.

Why another alternative echo? Why not? Why not a dozen
alternative echos to discuss NEW VISIONS?  Discuss the news you
read in the alternative press and on Anews, nytransfer, peaceNet,
ecoNet, conflictNet with a little poetry thrown in.

What is P_news?

It is "Progressive" news, views & poetry.

The "P" also stands for a "Peaceful" resolution of conflicts,
wherever possible and not wars for oil or tyranny or right wing
dictatorships because they are supportive of exploitive social
orders. No more genocide in our name.

It  stands for "Poetry", that contains social commentary, and
relates to the human condition. Poetry contains a language of its
own. It is metaphor and images, a painting on the canvass of the
mind, using words to evoke feelings and stir the sleeping soul.

And it stands for "Progressive", that tendency for justice and
more humane attitudes and a recognition that abuses will occur
unless we vigilently struggle for the protection of the weakest,
the dowtrodden and the most unfortunate among us.

It is the recognition that we desperately need a clean
environment, affordable housing, decent mass transportation.
We need sanity and to vigorously move away from the
conspiratorical hypocracy that rules. We need democracy for all
the people and we don't have it, not enough of it, and we aim to
get it, and that's human nature----or put in another way, in the
nature of our humanity, to insist on decency, peace, and social
justice.

FidoNews 9-17                  Page 9                      27 Apr 1992


This echo is for PROGRESSIVE positions only. NO flames! NO right
wing debate. NOT a forum for reactionary politics.

We hope to be on the national backbone soon. Ask your sysop to
have the REC request it on the ZEC conference echo so we can
establish your link to P_news.
