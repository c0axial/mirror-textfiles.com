     I've  always been big on giving out free advice.  Some would call
     that a shortcoming,  but at least  I  occasionally  take  my  own
     advice.

     I  remember  in particular one company I used to work for.  Every
     week they had a staff meeting I was required to go to,  and every
     week  the  head of the company would encourage anyone who had any
     criticisms to stand up and speak his peace.  Never having learned
     to be especially diplomatic (I was once told that I had the  tact
     and subtlety of a Sherman tank), I would take him at his word and
     speak out.

     This had several unfortunate side effects,  one of which was that
     disgruntled employees started standing around my desk complaining
     about how awful things were.  They would be surprised to discover
     that I wasn't very sympathetic.  I generally told them  that,  if
     things  were  all that intolerable,  then they should quit and go
     somewhere else.

     Then  the  day  came  where  something  happened  that  I   found
     intolerable.  Within  the hour my letter of resignation was on my
     supervisor's desk and I was out the door.  I've never  had  cause
     to regret that.

     What  does  all  this  have  to  do with FidoNet?  Patience,  I'm
     getting to that.

     Quite  some  time  ago  (more  time  than  I care to think about,
     actually) Ken Kaplan and Ben Baker roped  me  into  helping  them
     figure  out  how  to  run  this  net.  This was before we made it
     democratic,  so there wasn't a whole lot in the way of  feedback.
     We  worked  under  the  premise that if anyone was really unhappy
     with what we were doing, they'd leave and form their own net.

     So once again it's time for me to  take  my  own  advice.  For  a
     number  of  reasons  I'm unhappy about how things are going these
     days,  so I'm leaving to help form a new net.  This  will  be  my
     last issue of FidoNews.  Dale Lovell will be taking over  as  the
     FidoNews publisher starting next week.

     To all of you who have been supportive for lo these  many  moons,
     you  have  my sincere and heartfelt thanks.  To all the rest,  no
     hard feelings.  Best of luck to all of you.  By and  large,  it's
     been fun.

     Bob Morris, Co-Chair, FTSC High-Speed Modem Committee
     16/0

     After three months of testing, it is finally out, at least for a
     couple of manufacturers we, the committee, have tested the name
     brands with more to come.

     If you had thought that we were going to recommend a modem, well,
     you will have to make your own decision!  As a committee we have
     decided that we would undertake this task with you, the sysop and
     user in mind.  As such, we will not be making a decision as to
     what should be or should not be a "Standard" for the FidoNet
     community.  What we have done is to evaluate these modems "Out of
     the Box" so that we would do a equal comparison of what happens
     when you get the boxes yourselves.

     As of this writing, we have looked at and tested the Telebit
     Trailblazer, the Microcom AX9624c, the Hayes V-Series 9600 and
     the US Robotics HST with MNP 5.  We have also started to look at
     the Ven-Tel Pathfinder 18K modem, which is compatible with the
     Trailblazer and is the only other modem on the market that is
     compatible with any of the other brands at high speed.

     The testing on the Hayes, Robotics and Ven-Tel is basically
     unfinished at this time, but we thought that it was time to at
     least report on what we have found to date.  The prices for the
     modems vary from the HST at $495.00 to $672.50 for the
     Trailblazer modem.  Additionally, we have not yet tested the
     Trailblazer Plus within the Fido Compatible software available,
     nor were we able to bring into our testing a copy of Fido V 12,
     but we will assume that it is compatible with the current
     software versions in use today.

     Many of the manufacturers have been more than willing to assist
     us in this endeavor and have contacted us to insure that the
     products we had were operating properly.  We must state at this
     time that the V.29 "Standard" which exists today is not a true
     data communications standard but one which exists for FAX
     machines and the transmission of data for those pieces of
     equipment.  The high speed modem standard will probably be based
     upon the V.32 standard under which we can probably expect that
     all of the manufacturers will have equipment which talks to one
     another at high speed.  All modems tested talked to other brands
     at at least 2400 BPS.  Data transmission to locations outside of
     the Continental United States were tested and the modem which
     communicated the best via high speed using a registered data jack
     and a "Data Line" was the Trailblazer, which obtained 815 CPS to
     Australia.  However, this modem is fairly well distributed
     overseas and has been accepted, as the V.29 standard, in a number
     of countries outside of the United States.

     It is important to note that owners of systems which are based
     FidoNews 4-48                Page 3                   28 Dec 1987


     upon the 8088 which run on an original clock speed of 4.77 MHz
     should be aware that a problem does exist when attempting to
     utilize these modems above 9600 bps.  According to most of the
     documentation available at the time, the data bus cannot handle
     sustained speeds of 9600 or greater.  This would limit the speed
     of the modem, but XT and XT Clone owners can expect between 3600
     and 9600 BPS, AT owners can expect between 7200 and 13000 when
     using systems equipped with the 16450 UART and machine speeds of
     at least 6 MHz when dealing with archived data as is found in
     Echomail and file transfers of Archived data.

     There is a new term which is CPS, which is the character
     throughput with these new modems.  CPS, simply stated, is the
     character count expressed as actual characters (10bits = 1
     Character).  Therefore if throughput is expressed as 1320 CPS,
     then the actual throughput (in old and familiar terms) is 13200
     BPS.

     The following is a report dealing with the Microcom AX9624c and
     the Telebit Trailblazer.  Both of these modems operated on both
     the AT&T PC6300 Plus and an ARC Turbo AT Clone, both of these
     machines worked in different environments, the AT&T utilized
     SEADog 4.1 as the communications program and operates at 6MHz
     utilizing the 8250 UART.  The ARC Turbo AT utilized OPUS 1.03a as
     both the BBS program as well as the mailer, this AT uses the
     16450 UART and an 8MHz clock.

     The Microcom was equipped with the current version of the
     Firmware (ROM Version 1.6) and the Telebit was equipped with
     their current version (Rom Version 3.00).

     The Microcom utilizes MNP Class 6 as a form of error correction,
     but the Microcom's implementation appears to be less tolerant of
     noisy Central Offices, weather changes and long distance
     connections.  If utilized within a one hundred (100) mile radius
     the modem appears to communicate reliably with another Microcom
     of the same type.  Technical support is available for the
     product, but this support is somewhat onesided, when called about
     a problem, they do not appear to have the desire to call back
     with a solution if one is found.  On two occasions I have had to
     make calls to obtain the answer to a question which was given to
     them.  They have stated that the modem works best when "No
     Protocol" is used to transmit the data.  This would require Opus,
     Seadog, BinkleyTerm and presumably Fido Version 12 to provide for
     this modem and develop some sort of protocol when talking to
     another Microcom.  Users of this modem will notice that the modem
     must be sent the dialing string twice in order for it to actually
     dial the number.  It also appears to be slower to respond to
     commands issued from the keyboard (Opus' "K" command for
     example).

     The Trailblazer works directly out of the box, just like the
     Microcom, but requires a different type of setup string, in that
     Telebit utilizes internal switches instead of the more
     recognizable commands.  The Trailblazer appears to talk well in
     almost every situation, yet to be tested is the super long
     FidoNews 4-48                Page 4                   28 Dec 1987


     distance communication to a super noisy central office
     environment.  The physical size of this modem is larger than the
     Microcom but also provided is a fan for cooling and an on/off
     switch.  The options, once written into the memory of the machine
     remain there until changed by the Sysop.  This modem works in
     both the Opus and SEAdog environments and it is assumed to also
     work in the Fido Version 12 environment.  Technical support was
     not used during the first 120 days of the test but additional
     data will be attached to the next report if it is utilized.

     Modem set-up for the Telebit Trailblazer and the Ven-Tel
     Pathfinder 18K are as follows:

         E1 F1 M0 Q0 P V1 X1
         S0=1 S1=0 S2=43 S3=13 S4=10 S5=8 S6=2 S7=60 S8=2 S9=6 S10=7

         S110=255 S111=255 S112=1
         S121=0

     Note:  Pathfinder settings differ a bit.  Set S09=3, S53=4 and
            S64=1 when using Binkley Term.

     The Microcom AX9624c has external switches which must be set
     before the modem is placed on line.  The rear switch bank
     contains 8 switches, all switches must be up except for switches
     3 and 7.  On the front panel, switches 1, 6, 7, 9 and 10 are up
     with the others (2, 3, 4, 5 and 8) are down.  Additionally, the
     A/S switch must be released and in an out position.

     The Init strings for the Microcom is as follows:

     SEAdog 4.1

     The Hayes V-Series 9600 Modem was then tested by the committee
     and was found to be able to communicate with another Hayes V-
     Series 9600 in either an Opus to Opus or an Opus to Seadog or
     Seadog to Seadog envirnoment.  Throughput on this modem, using
     standard Echomail packets did not exceed 628 CPS, but when used
     in a standalone environment, file transfers did approach 800 CPS
     when using ZModem protocol for file up/downloads.  The set up
     used on this modem is the same one as found in the OPUS.CTL file.

     It is important to note that although this modem gave the lowest
     average transfer rates, the representatives from Hayes are
     continuing to work with the committee to evaluate the setting
     utilized and attempt to isolate the problem.  There will be
     furthur testing on this modem, providing that Hayes will allow us
     to have access to the modem in the future.  Until that time, we
     will simply state that the modem does work in all of the current
     environments in use today.

     The committee also obtained two of the new US Robotics HST modems
     equipped with the MNP 5 programming.  To date our testing has
     shown that when tranferring data from one of these new modems to
     a "Old Style" HST, the new modems do not appear to be downwardly
     compatible with the older modems.  These modems when talking to
     another MNP5 modem become very sensitive when using either XModem
     or similiar protocols.  As the tests are not completed at this
     time for these new modems the report on this modem will be
     forwarded at the time that the tests are completed.

     It is important to note that in almost all cases, when dealing
     with a modem which utilizes MNP Protocol 4, 5 or 6 that there
     appears to occur a condition in which the modem to modem link
     becomes questionable to the modems themselves and causes major
     problems when using protocols which utilize error corrction
     routines, such as XModem, since it appears that the two error
     checking routines clash with one another.  This clash appears to
     cause a loss in data transfer rates from 35-60% of the rated
     speed of the interface (UART).

     The committee is also evaluating the Ven-Tel Pathfinder 18K modem
     FidoNews 4-48                Page 6                   28 Dec 1987


     for use within our environment.  The Pathfinder also uses PEP,
     Packetized Ensemble Protocol like the Trailblazer, and it's major
     positive attractions are the smaller size and the setup which
     duplicates the Trailblazer.

     In discussions with the Regional Manager from Microcom, there
     appears to be some inconsistancies when dealing with protocols
     which within themselves provide for error checking.  This is
     evidenced by the lower transfer rates using Xmodem type protocols
     and the higher transfer rates under YModem or IModem.  This
     particular company has stated that they are planning on offering
     a PROM change which will allow high speed without MNP 4, 5 or 6.

     From all of the conversations that we have seen, both in EchoMail
     areas as well as in Private NetMail, there has been a lot of
     discussion concerning which modem if any should be selected as a
     standard for high speed data transmission.  It doubtful that any
     of the manufacturers, except for Telebit, have the capacity
     available to them within the existing modems to duplicate the
     protocols of any of the other brands currently in the
     marketplace.  It is felt that at the current V.29 standard there
     will exist no one standard, therefore the battle for marketshare
     will be made by price alone and not by the technology itself.
     The V.32 standard, however, will force each of the manufacturers
     to adopt one standard for High Speed data communications and will
     force the standard as it will be an International Standard for
     all manufacturers and not open to interpretation by each of the
     modem manufacturers.  Until that happens, it is doubtful that any
     one manufacturer will be able to capture more than a percentage
     of the market.

     Anyone wishing to forward their comments may do so to me at 16/0
     or 16/2.

     This is a copy of an open echo mail message I received on
     12/14/87. My reply to this message is also here. I think everyone
     should read both of these and send comments as soon as possible.
     This could have a drastic effect on our Net, and we need input
     (good or bad) from EVERY Sysop in the Net as soon as possible.


     Date:  12-12-87  19:13
     From:  David Hart
     To:    William Bertholff
     Subj:  AN OPEN MESSAGE


     I feel obligated to comment on today's Sysop meeting which, in my
     opinion, was nothing less than a fiasco.

     On or about November 13, you asked us by netmail if we would be
     interested in attending a Sysop meeting to explore forming a
     Sysop Association. One month was adequate notice but the meeting
     was not confirmed until about one week ago. At that time, you
     sent the original respondents the files for the meeting including
     an agenda, "proposed" articles of the Association and a statement
     of ethics.

     Though the entire Net 107 could be effected by these actions, you
     chose to supply this material only to those individuals who
     indicated an interest in attending. You have subsequently stated
     that the files were posted at the IGATE (who would know and so
     what?).

     A few days ago, you and I spoke by telephone. Rather than discuss
     any of the issues at hand we discussed the format of the meeting.
     I thought that we both agreed that the format would be a forum to
     openly discuss our views. I expressed my fears that the meeting
     would become either autocratic or technocratic. You assured me
     this would not be the case.

     I arrived, as schedule at 12:00 noon.

     You arrived, without apology, at 1:00 PM.

     From the outset, you made it very clear that this was your
     meeting. You stifled discussion. You yelled and screamed (like a
     child) at cross talk.

     Nevertheless you made no attempt to follow an agenda or do
     anything in a democratic or in a professional manner.



     Now I run a prosperous company. I have been the COO of a
     $40,000,000 organization and I won't be subjected to your temper
     tantrums.

     During the first hour, in your absence, I spoke with the attorney
     who you had hired (without anybody's consent).  I was informed
     FidoNews 4-48                Page 8                   28 Dec 1987


     that you had encumbered (without authorization) the association-
     to-be to the tune of $2,500 which the lawyer had agreed to
     discount to $700.  I also learned that you instructed counsel
     (without prior consent of anyone else) to form a FOR PROFIT
     corporation.

     From a tax and organizational standpoint this would be
     preposterous but in true Bertholff style, ya' just did it! This
     meant that my buy in would include assumption of YOUR structure
     and YOUR legal fees.

     Frankly, a better first step would have been to form the
     association and then to have the association retain counsel and
     draft by-laws in accordance with the wishes of the membership as
     contrasted to the wishes of William.

     During the "meeting" you presented and allowed some other people
     to present their views for what the association could and should
     be.

     We differed in that YOU were suggesting that the association, by
     natural process over time become net 107 (or visa versa). I
     agreed and suggested that the association become the legal entity
     formed by Net 107. I felt that your approach was deceptive to the
     Net but you didn't want to hear it and wouldn't allow discussion.
     We both know that, though this was not a net 107 meeting you were
     attempting to form a legal entity that would control the net. You
     admitted as much.  Unfortunately, your way of doing things is
     through self-egrandizing subterfuge.

     You then asked that we agree to accept the by-laws which were
     never discussed. You further suggested that we agree to meet
     again in late February to elect officers.

     I suggested that we form a steering committee to author a "Call
     for Comment" of net 107 of the by-laws as you had drafted them
     and that the steering committee draft revised by-laws based on
     the input of the entire net.

     These would then be presented for ratification in the February
     meeting. No time would be lost but some of your power might be.
     Others suggested that this might not be practical and that the
     by-laws could "always be changed".

     However I think some people lost sight of the fact that this
     change would have to then be by 2/3 majority rather than a simple
     majority. Therefor, it is possible that a minority could
     effectively control the organization.

     You then had the unmitigated gall to present the situation as
     your way or no way. NO DISCUSSION, NO IDEAS, NO DISAGREEMENT;
     King Bertholff. I tried to get my point across diplomatically and
     inoffensively but you can't handle anyone disagreeing with you.

     At this point, you slammed a fist down on the table, had an
     enormous temper tantrum and stormed out of the room.  You behaved
     FidoNews 4-48                Page 9                   28 Dec 1987


     like a 3 year old child who couldn't get his way. You asked those
     who disagreed with your approach to leave and I did (strange form
     of democracy).

     I came prepared to join (check in wallet). I left with nothing.

     I call for your immediate resignation as Network Host.  If that
     does not occur I will ask those who feel as I do to form a "more
     perfect" network in this area!

     Here is my reply to the above message.

     Date:  12-14-87  10:33
     From:  Gene Coppola
     To:    David Hart
     Subj:  Re: AN OPEN MESSAGE

     This is a reply to the echo mail about the meeting held Saturday.

     I was at first in favor of this new association. Now I am not so
     sure! Here are some of my concerns.

     The first question I have is a simple one. I am a host/hub for a
     private network (33 systems - Pace University) and have been
     refused the use of certain software granted to other hubs/hosts
     in the normal network. If 107 incorporates and becomes a FOR
     PROFIT corporation will they lose the right to use some of IFNA's
     software as well? If so, then this could be a problem.

     The second question I have is regarding taxes.  Stockholders in a
     FOR PROFIT corp. must pay taxes on earnings, if I understand the
     IRS laws on this matter?  Also, who pays the corporation taxes,
     etc; required by state law?

     Third, what state will this corporation be started in?

     Fourth, what protection if any will it grant a sysop from
     liability resulting from, incorrect phone numbers, messages
     containing information not normally public (unknown to sysop) and
     other protections? And, does not IFNA provide these same
     protections as well?

     Fifth, as a FOR PROFIT corporation, does it not go against the
     very reasons behind the initial formation of Fidonet?

     Sixth, if a node currently in Net107 refuses to join the
     corporation does he lose the right to use his hub, and the
     resulting OGATE?

     FidoNews 4-48                Page 10                  28 Dec 1987


     Seventh, by forming this corporation, will the resulting Net
     still be included in the official "IFNA NODELIST"?  Perhaps not,
     we will have to see how IFNA will rule on this A comment from
     IFNA would be nice if IFNA cares to make one on what effect it
     would have.

     Eighth, what costs would be involved both to the sysops who join,
     and the sysops who don't join? Will the IGATE start charging to
     handle incoming mail? Will the OGATE start charging to handle
     outgoing mail? Will OTHER Nets charge to handle mail from 107
     systems?

     And last, since Net 107 is NOW IN EXISTENCE, I feel that any move
     like this to organize should be made, by FIRST applying to the
     Regional Coordinator for a NEW Net Number Assignment for the
     corporation. I am sure there will be some people who WILL NOT
     desire to join, so why inconvenience them? If people feel a need
     to form a new corporation then they should break away and obtain
     a new Net number for their group! There are plenty of people in
     Net107 who can take over the various duties, if it comes to this!

     I think this is a SERIOUS issue, that needs to be fully discussed
     BEFORE anyone votes on this matter.  Comments pro and con are
     welcome from anyone interested!



     That ends my reply. I am not saying that anything in the above
     reply will come true. These are just questions I feel I need
     answers to BEFORE I vote on this matter.

     Sak, 107/529

                         The Other Side of MetroNet

     Apparently, the meeting of December 12th didn't satisfy everyone.
     A message has been going around the net intended to  explain  the
     events  of  that  meeting  in  such  a  way  as  to color William
     Bertholff as Hitler.  Seeing as I also attended this  meeting,  I
     thought  another point of view might balance the net's perception
     a bit better.

     About a month or so prior to the meeting,  Bill posted a net wide
     invitation to all sysops.  As a courtesy, I responded saying that
     I doubted that I could manage to make it into NYC. Bill called me
     voice and helped arrange a ride  for  me.  Later,  the  meeting's
     location  was  changed  to New Brunswick and my commuting problem
     vanished. Nonetheless, it should be noted that when I showed even
     the slightest bit of interest, Bill responded, and responded in a
     manner intended to solve those problems that stood between me and
     my attendance.

     At some point during the next few weeks,  I received a call  from
     Bill  notifying me that several files would be sent to my system.
     He  explained  further  that  these  files  were  the  definitive
     documents  of  a proposed BBS related organization and should be,
     therefore, read carefully.

     In other words,  he was calling a meeting to show his  peers  the
     work he had done and asking them to accept or reject it.

     Granted,  those  that didn't respond to that invitation,  may not
     have had the background I did,  but,  considering the  amount  of
     work  such  a task entails,  I can surely understand making those
     who showed interest the target of  the  work.  Egos,  being  what
     they are,  and practicality,  being what it is,  often collide in
     bruised self-interest.  Most understand and make  room  for  this
     relationship;  some  don't  and,  in  so doing,  belittle all but
     superhuman efforts.

     The meeting was to start at 12 noon.  Bill wasn't there  at  that
     time  so  the  lawyer  retained  by  Bill opened the meeting.  He
     explained that:

      1) he in no way represented any incumbrance  to  anyone  in  the
         room,

      2) only  in the event the organization was accepted by the group
         did he expect any payment at all,

      3) he was willing to discount  his  fee  for  the  sake  of  the
         organization creation,

      4) such  and organization was necessary for numerous reasons (of
         which he gave very good examples), and

      5) related his background in law to verify his credentials.
     FidoNews 4-48                Page 12                  28 Dec 1987


     Of the Sysops present (maybe 25 at the time,  although the number
     grew  to  over 40),  two Sysops assumed a confrontational posture
     asserting that Bill had no right to retain a lawyer for them, nor
     did the lawyer have any right to incumber them. The lawyer simply
     restated that no one was  incumbered  and  that  Bill  alone  had
     retained him.  Nonetheless,  these two pressed the same questions
     again and again.  In fact,  discussion was reduced to a three way
     conversation to the exclusion of the rest of us.

     At  about  1pm  Bill  arrived.  The  anonymous  message's  author
     maintains that he did so without  apology.  This  is  untrue.  He
     apologized  about missing his train,  and immediately got down to
     business.

     He began by asking everyone present to make some noncontroversial
     changes to the articles and ethics standards.  These changes were
     culled  over  the  preceding week from conversations with several
     sysops.  Largely these changes were inconsequential to the  sense
     of the document, save the change from 3 board members to 5. Next,
     he explained the "big picture" (i.  e., the why's and wherefore's
     of  such  and  organization).  Then  he  opened  the  meeting  to
     questions from the floor.

     During  the  question  period,  one  of  the  two sysops that had
     previously taken the lawyer to task,  demanded that he be allowed
     to  make  a  statement.  Bill  reminded  him  that  he was taking
     questions at present,  that there would be a  time  for  comments
     later. The sysop persisted, making asking question very difficult
     in deed.  Nonetheless,  quite a few were asked, and Bill answered
     them all candidly.  Once the questions stopped, and after another
     sysop announced that he supported the proposed organization (over
     Bill's objections that he too was out of order,  I might add),  a
     ten minute break was announced so that sysops  could  talk  among
     themselves.  The  break  lasted 20 minutes and everyone exchanged
     opinions.

     The meeting reconvened,  and the floor was opened for discussion.
     The  sysop  that demanded to make a statement during the question
     period,  now demanded to ask questions.  Once  again  this  sysop
     asserted  that  Bill  had no right to do any of the things he had
     done; that Bill had some how stolen everyone's rights. I think at
     this point everyone was pretty fed up with  the  same  questions,
     the  same  accusations,  the same "if-you-make-your-idea-MY-idea-
     I'll-be-quiet",  but order was the privilege of the  chair.  Bill
     did  attempt  to  call order any number of times,  but this sysop
     persisted  in  trying  to  assert  his  out-of-order   questions.
     Finally,  Bill  slammed his fist to the table and demanded order.
     With that, a very small contingent of sysops walked out.

     Thus the letter of complaint came to be.

     In it the writer lays claim to  superior  business  judgement  by
     stating that he runs his own organization and once was the CEO of
     a  $40,000,000  firm.  I  wish  I could tell you how many times I
     heard that at the meeting.  I also run my own  company  and  have
     done  so  for  more  than  10 years;  I think I can make business
     FidoNews 4-48                Page 13                  28 Dec 1987


     decisions too, and most of mine have paid off just fine.  I would
     like  to  tell  the  writer of that message here and now that his
     resume doesn't mean that "no one else can  think".  Besides,  the
     moderate  successes  that  it reports seem to indicate a downhill
     trend.

     The letter also states that incorporating in  NYC  is  the  wrong
     thing  to  do.  I have my own opinion on this,  but I do remember
     this post-CEO of a $40,000,000 company proclaiming to the meeting
     that he could offer  NYC  office  space  should  the  company  be
     incorporated there.  It's interesting that now, once the post-CEO
     of a $40,000,000 company walked out  of  the  meeting,  this  has
     become a bad idea altogether and proof of bad decision making.

     Furthermore,  the  letter  states  that  it  is terrible that the
     lawyer and Bill incumbered the organization-to-be.  I sure  would
     like  to  know  what  the  author  expected.  It seems to me,  we
     received the cheapest legal advice any of us are likely  to  get.
     It  also  seems  to  me,  the lawyer bent over backwards to be as
     accommodating fee-wise as is humanly possible.  If anything,  I'd
     say that Bill cut a mean deal, and that we should all be grateful
     for it.

     The   author   maintains   that   a  FOR-PROFIT  organization  is
     ridiculous, that it should be NONPROFIT organization. I'll really
     have to check my facts here,  but I believe there  are  far  more
     governmental  regulations  and  red  tape  attached  to nonprofit
     organizations  than  there  are  to   for-profit   organizations.
     Furthermore,  the tax liability issue is easily managed by virtue
     of the organization's ability to manage its profits.  Once again,
     it seems to me, the choice was a wise one.

     The  letter  also mentioned that by buying into the organization,
     one  would  also  be  buying   into   Bill's   legal   fees   and
     organizational  structures.  I  never  bought  into anything that
     didn't  have  overhead  as  a  cost   consideration.   CEO's   of
     $40,000,000  companies  usually deal with this concept daily.  Be
     that as it may,  buying into the structure still remains.  As far
     as I can remember,  I must have seen 100 different structures for
     as many organizations.  Most of them seem to work as long as  the
     people involved want them to. It's pretty obvious to me, overhead
     and  organizational  structure aren't really the objections here;
     rather they are skinned egos and self-importance.

     All in all,  I have to say I'm glad Bill took  the  bull  by  the
     horns.  For  too  long the net has been talking about the weather
     but doing nothing about it.  Now,  that one of  our  members  has
     taken the initiative to do something about it,  some seem to feel
     cheated rather than gratified. Perhaps this is a natural feeling.
     Bill's action has underscored the notion that other  people  have
     good ideas too . . . with or without CEO approval.
