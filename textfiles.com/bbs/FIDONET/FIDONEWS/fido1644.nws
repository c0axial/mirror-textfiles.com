                            New Fidonews Columnist

     Fidonews welcomes Warren D. Bonner to the Fidonews staff as a
     feature columnist.  Warren writes under the pen name of "Ol'WDB" and
     specializes in history and humor.

     Ol'WDB revealed that he maintains a collection of "keepers," such as
     the articles he published last week and this, in conjunction with
     his work as a free-lance writer.  Warren is currently working on a
     historical manuscript about the true high seas battles in the
     Atlantic Campaign of World War II.  His latest book, "The Mighty
     `E'astwind" is due for publication soon by the U. S. Government
     Press.

     Warren is a member of Net 103 along with Joe Jared, Fidonews
     columnist who has done such a great job in keeping the Internet
     information current and accurate.  Speaking of Joe, catch his column
     this week.  He's been looking at the Fidonet sites and identified
     some which don't respond or don't appear to be related to Fidonet.
     If you operate one of these sites and are experiencing temporary
     difficulties, now is a good time to talk with Joe before your site
     is deleted.  Joe has also added information about Internet Relay
     Chat and Newsservers.

                         The New MODERATOR Moderator

     Last week, even as Fidonews was being put together, Kent Anderson
     announced that Tom Knowles had resigned as moderator of the echo
     MODERATOR and named Kent to the job.  Tom, presumably, had found
     personal issues would limit his further involvement in Fidonet...
     though many speculated that charges of ELIST tampering may have
     influenced his decision.

     Kent Anderson has been a moderator's moderator for some time on
     Fidonet.  He's well known for his even approach in the echoes he
     moderates, and his helpfulness to other moderators in general.
     Already, Kent has defused most of the unrest in the MODERATOR echo
     brought about by Tom Knowles authoritarian style.

     As Tom Knowles - either the real person or the alter ego - becomes
     but a dim memory in Fidonet, I expect the ELIST tampering issue to
     fade also... unresolved.  Like most unresolved issues, though, it
     will rise Phoenix-like from it's own ashes, at the most inconvenient
     times.

      Hi All

     Jackson Harding has asked me to pass on the following information
     due to his system having crashed.

     The other day his system had a fatal failure. The system is beyond
     immediate repair and due to work committments (possibly overseas for
     a few months) available time to make such repairs is in short
     supply.

     As such and the fact he can not get on line to tell you personally,
     he has asked me to make this post.

     Jackson has stated he will not be returning to the net. That he has
     formally resigned as Z3C as of now.

     He wishes all of us well and has asked me to contact the RCs (which
     has been done) to organise a replacement.

     As for the nodelist, well, if its on his machine we may be up the
     creek for trying to retrive it. I have put it to the RCs perhaps
     whoever replaces Jackson should give us a FULL list asap and we can
     go from there.

     You will no doubt be hearing from the RCs soon. In the conversations
     I have had with them it looks like Malcolm Miles will be a good
     prospect to take the caretaker role pending an election.

     I suggested that if everyone is happy with Malcolm that we just get
     on with it (forego an election). We have just had one recently and
     there is no point to re-invent the wheel so soon unless there is
     severe discontent. (sorry Malcolm, I've put you in it).

     This is all of course is all subject to Malcolm and the majority of
     RCs being in agreement.

     Even though Jackson can not read this I think a thank-you is in
     order from us here in SA and on behalf of the member boards here

     best wishes with the future.

     I suppose this is all that really needs to be said at this point and
     it will now be up to the RCs and input from the rest of us.

     Z2C's IP node hostility
     By Peter Karlsson, 2:206/221.0

     About a month ago, I got a netmail from the Z2C stating that my IP
     node, 2:206/222.0, wasn't allowed to be listed according to the
     specifications used in the nodelist and recently documented by the
     FTSC:

     "To make a long story very short, in Z3 '000' is the number to alert
     the emergency-services. Whether or not dial-translation should take
     care of that in the nodelist is irrelevant because there always will
     be buggy systems that may create havoc; when we have an opportunity
     to avoid potential problems we shouldn't dismiss it, therefore I
     support Jackson Harding (the ZC/3) in his actions."

     "Therefore I am now instructing you, nodes/hubs/hosts/NCs/RCs that
     are involved in zone-2, to deal with this issue and get rid of the
     '000-'-entries. You have until Nov.1 1999 to do this, after that
     date the '000-'-number will systematically be replaced by
     '-unpublished-' and a 'Pvt' inserted in front."

     This is utter stupidity. IP nodes are here to stay, and we have a
     standard of listing them that is actually supported by both mailers
     and nodelist compilers. Why should people that can't configure their
     mailers properly stop that?

     Oh, and if anyone wonders why I'm writing this here instead of
     taking it up with the Z2C, let me quote the ending paragraph in the
     netmail:

     "Anyone that doesn't agree may make himself heard but unless a
     loaded and cocked hotgun points to my delicate parts I am not
     inclined to move on this one."

     Oh, well. Guess I'll see in the next nodelist whether my nodelisting
     of 2:206/222.0 is gone or not. And if it is, well... I'm seriously
     considering leaving Fidonet after over five years of active
     participation. :-(

     \\//
     Live long and prosper,
       Peter Karlsson

     Subject: Root of Modern Engineering Design Principles
     From:  Ol'WDB

     The US standard railroad gauge (distance between the rails) is 4
     feet 8.5 inches. That's an exceedingly odd number.  Why was that
     gauge used? Because that's the way they built them in England, and
     the US railroads were built by English expatriates.  Why did the
     English build them like that? Because the first rail lines were
     built by the same people who built the pre-railroad tramways, and
     that's the gauge they used. Why did 'they' use that gauge then?
     Because the people who built the tramways used the same jigs and
     tools that they used for building wagons, which used that wheel
     spacing. Okay! Why did the wagons have that particular odd wheel
     spacing? Well, if they tried to use any other spacing the wagon
     wheels would break on some of the old, long distance roads in
     England, because that's the spacing of the wheel ruts.So who built
     those old rutted roads? The first long distance roads in Europe (and
     England) were built by Imperial Rome for their legions. The roads
     have been used ever since.  And the ruts? The initial ruts, which
     everyone else had to match for fear of destroying their wagon wheels
     and wagons, were first made by Roman war chariots. Since the
     chariots were made for, or by Imperial Rome, they were all alike in
     the matter of wheel spacing. Thus, we have the answer to the
     original question. The United States standard railroad gauge of 4
     feet, 8.5 inches derives from the original specification for an
     Imperial Roman war chariot. Specifications and bureaucracies live
     forever. So the next time you are handed a specification and wonder
     what horses ass came up with it, you may be exactly right--because
     the Imperial Roman war chariots were made just wide enough to
     accommodate the back ends of two war horses. Now the twist to the
     story.............. There's an interesting extension to the story
     about railroad gauges and horses' behinds. When we see a Space
     Shuttle sitting on its launch pad, there are two big booster rockets
     attached to the sides of the main fuel tank. These are solid rocket
     boosters, or SRBs. The SRBs are made by Thiokol at their factory at
     Utah. The engineers who designed the SRBs might have preferred to
     make them a bit fatter, but the SRBs had to be shipped by train from
     the factory to the launch site. The railroad line from the factory
     had to run through a tunnel in the mountains. The SRBs had to fit
     through that tunnel. The tunnel is slightly wider than the railroad
     track, and the railroad track is about as wide as two horses
     behinds. So, the major design feature of what is arguably the
     world's most advanced transportation system was determined by the
     width of a Horse' Ass!

                           The Last Chocolate Chip
                              Thanks to Roy Reed
                               rcreedv@juno.com

     An elderly man lay dying in his bed.

     In death's agony, he suddenly smelled the aroma of his favorite
     chocolate chip cookies wafting up the stairs. He gathered his
     remaining strength, and lifted himself from the bed.

     Leaning against the wall, he slowly made his way out of the bedroom,
     and with even greater effort forced himself down the stairs,
     gripping the railing with both hands, he crawled downstairs.

     With labored breath, he leaned against the door-frame, gazing into
     the kitchen. Were it not for death's agony, he would have thought
     himself already in heaven: there, spread out upon waxed paper on the
     kitchen table were literally hundreds of his favorite chocolate chip
     cookies.

     Was it heaven? Or was it one final act of heroic love from his
     devoted wife, seeing to it that he left this world a happy man?

     Mustering one great final effort, he threw himself toward the table,
     landing on his knees in a rumpled posture. His parched lips parted:
     the wondrous taste of the cookie was already in his mouth, seemingly
     bringing him back to life.

     The aged and withered hand trembled on its way to a cookie at the
     edge of the table, when it was suddenly smacked with a spatula by
     his wife.

     "Stay out of those," she said, "they're for the funeral."
