If you really want to screw up...

by Tom Jennings (1:1/1)

...use a computer.

Because I was going away for a week, over a Sunday night I automated
FidoNews generation, and tested it quite thoroughly. It even handled
errors. I set a ONCE event to run, well, once, late Sunday afternoon.

However after testing I turned it ON instead of ONCE... even withouth
knowing Fido/FidoNet innards, you can maybe guess the rest...

(If you missed the excitement, FidoNews issues 9-06 through 9-23 came
out, once every few minutes, until George Peace stopped accepting them.
All of them were empty; my machine having decided to pitch them since
they were "last week's" articles.)

No one yelled at me. (Thank you!) One snickered. (Thanks for nothin' :-)
Maybe you all figured out the problem...

If you sent me an article that was supposed to run in Volume 9 Issue 6,
and you don't see it in this issue, it was lost. Please send it again.

Feedback on an "anonymous" article in 9/4
From: Bob Davis on 1:106/114
To: Tom Jennings on 1:125/111
Subj: fnews 904
Tom,

I was disappointed that you ran an anonymous article in this issue of
fidonews.  I wanted to give some intelligent rebuttal to the author via
netmail, but could not.

Anyway, this is just feedback for the future.  Please insist on public
authorship.  Some of the comments in this article could be rebutted with
hard facts.  I prefer not to write an article just to provide a counter
point.

                                        Thanks for listening,
                                        Bob


(* Ed note: While I believe there is frequently valid reason for
anonymity, I believe you are right in this case. It was a Rant, and
didn't cover dangerous ground (except maybe to ruffled feathers in the
author's life...). I will more carefully look at requests for anonymity.
Thanks for the feedback!  -- tomj *)

NEWSCHAT ECHO... or how to easily read Fidonews without really trying!
Do you receive Fidonews every week but never read it because it's too
much of a hassle to even remember where it is? Are you tired of using
your word processor or editor to view Fidonews? Are you just plain
lazy? :)

Now you don't have to unzip and print or read the FNEWS file in order
to see what's going on in Fidonet. The NEWSCHAT conference has been
started with the sanction and blessings of former Editor, Vince
Periello, and new Editor-in-Chief, Tom Jennings. It's for all of you
who are like me.... too lazy to bother unzipping the Fidonews and read
it. <grin>

This echo will contain the Fidonet News every week in message format.
Open to sysops and users alike.

There will be no acceptance of articles for submission to Fidonews in
the conference. This is strictly a place to read and comment on the
news and what's going on in Fidonet.

Come on in and find out what's new in Fidonet!!! Read the news online,
chat, or just talk about the news and how it affects us all.

NEWSCHAT is on the Backbone!!! Ask your NEC for it now!!

  ------------------------------------------------------------------

                        NEWSCHAT ECHO RULES

   This is an echo for sysops and users to read the weekly Fidonet News
online and to comment, chat and discuss what's happening in Fidonet as
read about in FidoNews. Please try NOT to address messages to EDITOR
since I can't guarantee that Tom Jennings will see them.  Durned if I
even know if he reads this echo. <sigh>  Send all mail for him directly
to him via netmail.  However, messages addressed to EDITOR in here will
be assumed to be to ALL.

Lastest Revision: 2-08-92
---+      new rule since last posted
---+C     changed rule since last posted

    The rules are simple.

  1. No submissions of articles for FidoNews will be accepted. Please
     make sure and send your submissions directly to 1:1/1. You may
     f/req ARTSPEC.DOC for information on submitting articles to
     Fidonews from my system or Tom Jenning directly.

  2. Though the news messages indicate that the news is issuing from
     1:1/1, please understand that they are coming from my system. If
     you have a problem, please netmail me directly and not 1:1/1.

  3. Play nice. This means CHALLENGE the issue, not the message
     poster. If you have a problem, please netmail the moderator.

  4. Foul language belongs in the street not here. Remember, people of
     all ages will be reading this conference. Please keep it clean.

  5. Spelling doesn't count! But check it anyway. You don't want to be
     embarrassed. Do you? <hehehehehe>

  6. This conference MAY NOT be ported to the BIX echomail system,
     GroupMail or to any other network's echomail system without
     permission of the Moderator.

  7. There is only one Moderator. If you feel someone has broken the
     rules please NETMAIL the Moderator and don't take it upon yourself
     to admonish anyone.

  8. Messages from the moderator concerning enforcement of the rules
     are not considered offtopic, however, neither are they topics for
FidoNews 9-07                  Page 4                      17 Feb 1992


     general discussion by anyone other than the moderator and the
     person being addressed.

  9. No advertising. You can advertise to your heart's content in the
     Fidonews itself and it will get here.

---+
 10. Discussions in this echo on ANY subject should be limited to one
     or two weeks ... long enough to determine if you'd like to
     continue in a more appropriate echo, netmail or drop the talk
     altogether but no longer. Let's not get bogged down on any one
     topic since Fidonews contains so many of interest.

    I work on a "three strikes you're out" basis.

    First a public warning.

    Second a netmail warning, if netmail capable.  CC'd to the sysop
(if you have one and you're not the Sysop yourself, in which case,
shame shame).

    Third time and you are asked to leave the conference.

    If you do not comply with a request to leave the conference, or if
a sysop does not comply with the moderator's request to disallow a user
from access to the conference, distribution of the echo can and will be
cut to that node. Excommunication from the echo shall be for a 15 day
cooling off period for first offense, 30-60 days for a second offense
(Moderator's option) and permanently should you be cut a third time.

  Sysops: Please don't make me do this. Curb your users and yourselves!

    The SysOp of each board carrying this echo is granted the right to
Edit or Kill messages which, in their opinion, are inappropriate and
unacceptable on their system.  Exception to this rule is the killing
or editing of any messages received prior to feeding them to linked
systems.  This is NOT permitted. Please use common sense when interpre-
ting this rule and, if in doubt, netmail queries will be promptly
answered.

     That's it, except that if someone comes up with a new and
     improved way to aggravate all and sundry I reserve the right
     to make a rule to fit the occasion.

Exit: Mark Howard, Enter: Bruce Bodger

The TAP feed between North America (Zone 1) and Europe (Zone 2)
has recently been changed from Mark Howard (1:260/1@fidonet) to
Bruce Bodger (1:170/400@fidonet). The European side is maintained
by Joop Mellaart (2:512/0@fidonet).

Aside from Felix Kasza (hey, are you still alive?), I think Mark
Howard is the person who has put more energy, blood, and tears
into TAP than anyone else. For those of you who don't know what
TAP is, it stands for (T)rans(A)tlantic(P)roject and is one of
the quickest mail movers in FidoNet.

I'd just like to say -- Thanks Mark, we couldn't have done it
without you -- and to Bruce, welcome!

                             SEAmail 1.10
                              Revision C

Revision C to SEAmail version 1.10 has been released and incorporates
the following changes:

 *  File requests and update requests generated by MAIL were not being
    properly targeted.  This has now been fixed.

 *  SEND, GET, REQ, and STARLINK were always routing per window S.
    They will now route per S only if given the NOW option, and will
    otherwise route per the current window.

 *  The network server could miss the start of a window if it was not
    in control at the time.  This has now been fixed.

 *  Kitten was failing to create the USERS.CAT file if it did not
    exist, thus causing problems on initial installation.  This has
    been fixed.

 *  Under certain circumstances RENUMBER would reference an internal
    table beyond the limits of the table.  This would cause the OS/2
    version to abort with a segment violation, and could also have
    deliterious results in the MS-DOS version.  This has now been
    fixed, along with some other pointer problems.

FidoNews 9-07                  Page 6                      17 Feb 1992


 *  MAIL was not inserting the proper destination address on non-
    private replies.  This has now been fixed.

 *  PACKER would sometimes skip over echomail messages when unpacking
    a compressed mail packet.  This should now be fixed.

 *  MAIL would hang if you tried to blank out the uplink address for a
    GroupMail folder.  This has now been fixed.

 *  A new VERSION.DOC file was added.  This will be automatically
    updated with each upgrade to reflect the current installed
    version.

 *  CFGEDIT used to reset the obscure parameters whenever it was run
    with the /I switch, which happens as a part of the upgrade
    process.  This has been changed.  CFGEDIT now has a /R switch to
    reset the obscure parameters.


Those with the MS-DOS version of SEAmail should go to their SEAmail
directory and type the command:

    upgrade sm110c

Those with the OS/2 version should type the command:

    upgrade sm110cp

NOTE: SEAmail revision patches are cumulative.  You *MUST* have
applied the SM110B revision patch in order to apply revision C.

We would like to take this opportunity to invite Desert Storm and any
other veteran holding a campaign ribbon to visit the In_Country Echo.
This echo is for veterans of any war, any conflict, any service and any
country.  We hope to be able to contact others whose experiences are
common to ours, but possibly from the otherside's viewpoint.  We are all
proud of our combat service and realize that it places us apart from
servicemen that may have served during our era; but whom may have not
earned a campaign ribbon.

We hope to make it a place that Combat Veterans can meet and maintain
that comeraderie that may be missing in civilian or military life.
Basically, to give us all a place where we can come to talk to people
that 95% of the time are going to understand exactly what we are trying
to say.  A place that is for the Combat Vet, not for his sister.

FidoNews 9-07                  Page 7                      17 Feb 1992


The Echo is moderated by Lefty Frizzell and Scott Summers.  Both of us
are
veterans of the Vietnam Conflict.  Scott is one of the founders of the
Houston
Foundation for Vietnam Veterans.  His son is a Saudi veteran...a fact
that Scott
is doubly proud of.

The echo has been available regionally for quite awhile and on the back
bone for 3 months.  Come join us and talk over old times.  We may not
have all the answers to your problems either personal or with the VA.
However, we may know someone that does.

The echo is sponsored by the Houston Foundation for Vietnam Veterans in
Houston, Texas.  They have helped many veterans since their inception.
They may be able to help you if you have a problem.

Anyhow, welcome home guys.  Hope to see you In_Country.

MISSING TEENAGE GIRLS

By Ward Dossche
   2:295/49

In the morning of February 26th 1991 Nathalie Geysbrechts was
abducted not far from her home in Bertem-Leefdaal (Belgium)
while waiting for the schoolbus. Very likely she was sighted
shortly afterward inside a car who was leaving the area.

Nathalie Geysbrechts was at the time of her dissappearance 10
years old, she was 1.35 meter tall and has blond hair.

In the evening of December 17th 1991 Katrien De Cuyper
dissappeared in Antwerp (Belgium) while en route home after
visiting a friend. She called home from a pub to tell her
parents that she missed the bus and would take the next one.
She was never heard from again after that.

Katrien De Cuyper is 15 years old, she stands 1.70 meter tall,
has shoulderlength blond hair, is slender and has blue eyes.

On December 30th 1991 Inge Breugelmans vanished close to her
home in Wuustwezel (Belgium) while biking to her boyfriend who
lived a few kilometers away. Her bike was found next to the
road without any further trace of what had happened.

Inge Breugelmans is 15 years old, stands 1.55 meters tall, has
very long blond hair, is slender and has green eyes.

FidoNews 9-07                  Page 8                      17 Feb 1992


Three dissappearance cases that shook this small country
because of a.o. the similarities involved.

All 3 girls are very young, have blond hair, good looks and
dissappeared without the slighest trace at all. They were never
heard from again. The same scenario applies to other
girls that dissappeared over the years in Belgium.

Needless to say the families are shattered and are going
through hell.

Everything possible has been done but, despite massive help and
search-parties in the surroundings, not one usable clue has
turned up. The authorities are not releasing news about the
investigation, but it is clear this is a very difficult case.

Because of the method that seems to be present in the way all
girls dissappear, the possibility of a gang-operation must not
be dissmissed, there may be a chance that all or some of the
girls are still alive but have been smuggled abroad to be
forced into hard-core child-pornographic stuff.

Three GIF-files have been produced with their pictures in it,
they are called NATHALIE.GIF, KATRIEN.GIF and INGE.GIF and are
available for download or file-request from 1:1/1 (Tom Jennings)
in the USA and 2:295/3 (Louis Van Geel) in Europe. Both systems
are HST-capable.

The three files are equally available in one file with the name
MISSING.LZH from these two systems.

It is asked that as many people as possible request or download
these files, that each person unpacks them and gives the
fotographs a circulation as wide as possible and asks around if
anyone anywhere has seen these girls lately or has any clue re:
their where-abouts.

Should information this way become available, please do not
hesitate to inform the non-profit-association of stricken
relatives here in Belgium who are coordinating the unofficial
search for Nathalie, Katrien and Inge.

They can be reached at the following address :

    Hulpfonds voor Ontvoerde en Vermiste Kinderen
    Borsbeekbrug 5 Bus 19
    2600 Berchem (Antwerp)
    Belgium

FidoNews 9-07                  Page 9                      17 Feb 1992


or send a netmail (preferably crash) to 2:295/49.

The search for the 3 girls is executed in close cooperation
with local and state police who are running their own
investigation as well. Any information that can be obtained in
this way will be as fast as anyway possible be made available
to the authorities here.

The non-profit association is also producing a stock of posters
in 4 languages (Dutch, French, German and English) with
fotographs and information about the missing girls. If anyone
wants some of these for local distribution, please order them
directly at the above address or netmail to 2:295/49. They will
be mailed free of charge.

Print quality computer files are also available (roughly 300 KB
per foto/unpacked), if necessary they will also be mailed free
of charge.

Any cooperation will be greatly appreciated, will be
aknowledged and mentionned in the reporting to the concerned
families. I am sure it will be comforting to them knowing that
so many people care.

C'mon fellas, show yourselves, we've got a piece of technology
here that can finally be put to some serious use instead of
ranting and flaming.

Thanks in any case already go to B-NET, the Belgian
sysop-association for sponsoring this initiative, to Willy
Brepoels of 2:292/101 for his immediate offer and cooperation
to produce the GIF- and printfiles, to Tom Jennings and Louis
Van Geel for opening their systems to distribute the files and
to all the others who are helping out.

Greetings,

BTW, just the other day another young girl was ambushed by a
guy who had a collaborator waiting in a car with Dutch
registration nearby. Luckily the girl managed to escape ...

             SKEPTIC Echo is alive and well!

SKEPTIC is presently a non-Backbone Echo that originally
sprang forth from the San Francisco area in the person of
Fredric Rice and the Node of 1:102/901. Fred and his system
went down suddenly last year and some of us still around
have been picking up the pieces and trying to restore all
the lost links coming out of that now defunct system.

I'm happy to report that the Bay Area Skeptics of San
Francisco are now back in the chain from Rick Moen's system
at 1:125/27 and that Australia [where the current Moderator
resides in the person of Jackson Harding of 3:681/857] and
Germany [in the person of Dieter Hummel of 2:243/11] and the
U.K. are also back in the loop. Tampa Bay Skeptics will soon
have their BBS up full-time and linked into FidoNet. Georgia
Skeptics may be able to link from their Familynet gates.

If any of you or your Sysops are interested in obtaining
this Echo, you or they should contact me at 1:374/14 or one
of the other Hubs above. SKEPTIC is also going to 1:203/53,
1:114/15, and 1:109/120 as a passthru if they are near you.

SKEPTIC is devoted to examination and report of paranormal
and fringe-science claims. It has NO official or unofficial
connection to CSICOP {Committee for the Scientific
Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal} but has a similar
philosophy. Claims are not rejected on a priori grounds but
rather are investigated by objective and critical inquiry.

The Echo is now fully activated and waiting for those with
an interest in the mission stated above.

It will be relisted in ELIST in next month's issue.

TTFN.

The HOLY_BIBLE conference guidlines:

             Official Guidelines for HOLY_BIBLE

1.  Prove your point with Bible verses.

2.  This is not a "Christian fellowship" conference, but rather a
    Christian Bible Study Conference.

3.  Please understand that there is not a cult, false church, or
    any variation thereof claiming affiliation with the Bible
    that doesn't just *know* in their heart that they are:

        a.  "Christian"

        b.  "saved"

4.  Four things that almost all fake christians will have in common are:

         a. Their utmost confidence in their false "salvation".

         b. Their staunch claim that they are "christian".

         c. Other people that are just as convinced as they are.

         d. A few misunderstood Bible verses that appear on
            perfunctory examination to support their "theories".

5.  The purpose of this conference is to look and see what the Bible
    *really* teaches and hopefully expose the con men that are claiming
    to be preaching the Bible while actually preaching an anti-Bible,
    false christian "message of deception".

6.  It is not a requirement that anyone believe the Bible in order to
    participate in it's study in this conference.

7.  If the Bible really is true and it is the Word of the great 'I
    AM' that created all things, then it is a spiritual book.  As
    such, true in-depth understanding of it requires serious PRAYER.
