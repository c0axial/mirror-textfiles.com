     As  I write this, the white stuff  outside  my  door  is  getting
     deeper  and  deeper.  Perhaps I'll get to  stay  home  from  work
     tomorrow and play with my computer.  That would be nice.

     In a few  months,  we're  going to reach the fifth anniversary of
     FidoNet's switch to Multinet.    Maybe  there  aren't  enough old
     geezers out there who appreciate  that  fact, but this one thinks
     we should do something to observe  that occurrence.  It will be a
     nice dry run for next year's fifth anniversary of Echomail...

     One of the criticisms I have heard of FidoNews  is the difficulty
     of locating the articles and their authors' names.  This is (yes,
     I know you hear  this  all  the  time)  not  entirely  my  fault.
     ARTSPEC.DOC is pretty clear on  a  suggested  style, and articles
     using  this  style  will  have the  information  presented  in  a
     consistent  location  in  the  story,  and will  most  likely  be
     properly indexed in the Table of Contents.   Many  weeks  I  find
     myself fixing up stories to conform to this, but  if I don't have
     the time, it just doesn't happen.

     Last week's banner page was so long  that very few items fit into
     the  Table  of Contents.  Since there were  so  many  interesting
     articles last week, that's  unfortunate.    I  have shortened the
     banner page somewhat.  I'm  going to work on it some more between
     this week and next, hopefully resulting  in  a basic presentation
     that will last a while.

     We now  have  the  route-through  arrangement with Harry's system
     complete.  He  tells  me that a few file requests for ARTSPEC.DOC
     came up empty this  week, though.  We've now fixed that.  At this
     point, I believe that we have 1:1/1 completely working at Harry's
     site.    We're  sorry  for any  inconvenience  our  fumbling  and
     bumbling might have caused you in the interim.

     That's it until next week. Happy Trails.

     Fidonet 2:507/8

                     A 300 bps modem tells about its past

     My career began under the christmas-tree, when a 12-year-old
     pupil living in New York got me as a present. He  had  never
     expected  to get  me (some  people fear  a 120% increase  of
     their phone bill), so his joy was  enormous, and  he  wanted
     to start the "maiden-voyage" immediately. But there was  the
     first hurdle: all the New York numbers were busy - many  pu-
     pils seemed to have gotten a modem as a  christmas  present.
     Luckily the resources of numbers were not  exhausted:  there
     still was the number of a very good multi-user  BBS  in  San
     Francisco. That wasn't a local call at all, and  I  wondered
     what the parents of my new owner would say about  the  phone
     bill. But at least that number wasn't busy - Pacific Time is
     3 hours  different  from  New York Time, and therefore there
     surely wasn't distribution of presents yet. The  first  ses-
     sion with  me could start. A very simple communications pro-
     gram had to be enough, but it was certainly better than  no-
     thing. The session lasted about 30 minutes, when  the father
     of my new owner asked: "Where are you connected to?  I  need
     the phone for ordering a table in the restaurant."  When  he
     heard the true answer  -  "San Francisco"  -  his  face went
     white, as he expected his statement of account  to  get  red
     numbers (for minus). That was no wonder , because  the phone
     bill had  been increased by at least 80%. I had a long break
     now.

     It was a "bad-cluster-life" for me to lie  in  the  cupboard
     unused.  The  father called  me  a  "100-$-note-eater",  and
     every time the son asked for the permission to use me  again
     the answer was "No". He seemed not to bear the high  bill  I
     had caused with the long-distance call to San Francisco. Af-
     ter three weeks (when  the holidays  were  over  and  school
     ate up most of my owner's time) I was used again. The father
     had caused more telephone charge than I with  the  long-dis-
     tance call by asking everybody who had something to do  with
     computers in any way for local BBS numbers that weren't busy
     and not too expensive to call. And - he had success.  Now  I
     wasn't a "100-$-note-eater" any more,  as  the  local  calls
     were free of charge. My owner could make long sessions with-
     out having to get pangs of conscience. I didn't have to  lie
     in the cupboard again.

     One of the local numbers was the "favorite": the number of a
     BBS which had a direct conference with one  in  Sydney,  Au-
     stralia. The messages were transported at night (the oversea
     charge was lower then) and arrived at the  destination  more
     quickly than a letter. One thing was not so good: the  sysop
     had to charge a little price for  the  usage of  the  confe-
     FidoNews 7-06                Page 3                    5 Feb 1990


     rence. That was easy to understand, oversea charge  was  not
     cheap at all, and he had to pay very much  for  that  hobby.
     But  that price was not so high as the first increased phone
     bill. Luckily, because the first one wasn't paid off yet. It
     had made a really big hole in the purse.

     When access to file areas was opened, my owner began to  no-
     tice that 300 bps aren't very fast. Programs got bigger  and
     bigger, and the transmission  time  made that the father  of
     my owner was an extremely hard-to-reach person. The line was
     always busy, callers had only a chance when my owner was  at
     school or doing homeworks. I feared a new "cupboard period".
     That nightmare didn't become true, but the busy line  prohi-
     bited my owner to wish a faster modem. If those  long  calls
     had been long distance or oversea calls -  imagine  what  an
     astronomical phone bill would have been caused!

     The highest point of my career began when my owner  discove-
     red a BBS which was connected to several hundred  others  in
     the USA. He could write messages to San Francisco, Los Ange-
     les, Anchorage or Nome now  without breaking  the  telephone
     charge world record. And his private mail was  full  of  re-
     plies every day. Unfortunately, the  300  bps prevented  him
     to read ALL the messages in the message boards. So the  call
     for  a  faster modem got louder and louder.  But  it  wasn't
     heard for a long time. I think it was the first  bill  which
     had caused that. What a pity - 300  bps became  less  actual
     from day to day, and long-distance calls were impossible be-
     cause of the long time needed for transmission...

     Then, after a few months, when my owner broke his  money-box
     in order to buy a faster modem and open  the door  to  long-
     distance and oversea calls, my hour rang. My owner  celebra-
     ted the "maiden-voyage" with his new, faster  modem,  and  I
     was no longer used. But I had a "memorial" - the first bill,
     and I could be sure that I had served  loyally in  my  time.
     And then, when I was put into  the  corner,  I  made  a  few
     questions: What a phone bill will the new modem cause?  Will
     the new modem remain actual for a longer time than  I?  Will
     my owner remember me, or will I simply no longer  exist  for
     him?

     I only found out the answer for the first question: The bill
     caused by the new modem got the  3rd  dimension -  exponents
     had to be used, otherwise the field "Amount to pay" had been
     to small. But I don't know what the father said  about  that
     bill. I only know that it had been caused by a  few  oversea
     calls.

     Secretary's Note:

                     The following is the completed Resolution that
     is presented to FidoNet.

          On the Future Dissolution of the International FidoNet
          Association


     WHEREAS:
         At the Board of Directors Meeting concluded on 27 Aug 1989
         a Resolution was passed to hold a Referendum of FidoNet to
         determine if the International FidoNet Association, Inc.
         should continue to exist, and

     WHEREAS:
         In the Referendum of FidoNet concluded on 1 Dec 1989 fewer
         than one half of the sysops of FidoNet desired that the
         Association officially represent them, and

     WHEREAS:
         The Board of Directors established the rule for the
         election that upon failure of this Referendum the Board of
         Directors would initiate dissolution of the Association,
         and

     WHEREAS:
         Missouri statute requires receiving at least two thirds of
         the votes entitled to be cast by members present at a
         membership meeting in order to dissolve a corporation


     therefore be it


     RESOLVED:
         That the Board of Directors recommends to the membership
         that the Association be dissolved.

     RESOLVED:
         That the question of dissolution be submitted to the
         membership for a vote at the next Annual Membership
         Meeting, or, prior to that meeting, by consent of the
         membership pursuant to Missouri statute 355.460.

     RESOLVED:
         That the Association take no action that is not required
         by statute, Articles of Association, or Bylaws until such
         time as the vote to dissolve is completed.

     RESOLVED:
     FidoNews 7-06                Page 12                   5 Feb 1990


         That the Regular Annual Board Meeting of our Association
         scheduled for 16 February 1990 is hereby canceled.

     RESOLVED:
         That the next Meeting of the Board of Directors of the
         Association shall be at the Annual Meeting of our
         membership after the vote is concluded, and that all
         motions now before the Board regarding the disposal of
         assets be tabled until that time.



     ==============================================================

     Secretary's Report:

             Please find enclosed the content of the letter sent
     to the Secretary of this Corporation by Tom Jennings.

             1.  This letter is to inform IFNA that I am
                 terminating our Trademark License Agreement that
                 allows IFNA the use of my trademarks, commencing
                 28 February 1990.

             2.  The vote by the network members this past 1
                 December 1989 clearly indicates that IFNA does
                 not represent the wishes and needs of the Fido
                 Net network at large, and therefore myself.


     Elections and Nominations Report

     Please consider my article in the January 1, 1990 edition
     of FidoNews (FNEWS701.ARC) to be the Final Report from the
     Elections and Nominations Committee.

     I have no recommendations on conclusion of ongoing business,
     as I do not consider that there is any ongoing business of
     this committee.  The election is concluded, and it would appear
     that there need be no nominations for any future posts.  Thus,
     the work of this committee is done.

     "Captain's Log, Stardate 9002.03..."
     by Phil Buonomo, 1:107/583@FidoNet 520/583@AlterNet 9:807/1@PNet

     The opinions expressed here are MINE, and do not represent anyone
     else's.  If you don't like 'em, tough.  Those wishing to express
     differing opinions are invited to jump off a cliff.  ;-)

     I suppose I should explain a little about the title of this
     column.  Ever since my CB days back in high-school, my handle
     has been "The Captain".  When I put up my first bbs, a Networks
     ][ that ran on my Apple ][ plus, back on July 1st, 1980, my
     handle was "The Captain" never "Sysop" (hence the name of my
     board, The Starship, now the Starship ][, since converting to an
     IBM PC).  Unlike most other 'starship' boards, however, I never
     called my system "The Enterprise", nor did I ever fashion myself
     as "Captain Kirk".  I wanted my own identity.  So, I called my
     'ship' the Potemkin ("P" for Phil), which has been the answer to
     a trivia question ever since ("So, what's the name of your
     StarShip?").  That over, on with the REAL column!

     A few issues ago, I wrote an article warning folks about
     incompatibilities between the new Front Door 1.99b and the
     SEAdog mailer.  The author had removed support for BARK style
     requests, which SEAdog generates, and the SEAlink protocol,
     which SEAdog supports.  This, and a bug in the new FTS-0001
     implementation, led to a failure for the two mailers to send
     files to each other (one of the basic definitions for being
     "FidoNet compatible" going back to distribution of the nodelist
     in the original Fido Network).  I warned of the incompatibility
     and demonstrated some ways to keep your mailer (whichever one
     you run) from running up your phone bill.

     Since then, the Front Door author has announced his intention to
     release a new version that WILL talk to SEAdogs, although it
     still won't support BARK requests or the SEAlink protocol, which
     means that while you WILL be able to get those files across,
     it'll only be at about 35% efficiency at 9600 baud.  The author
     has also returned the money of those Front Door users who've
     asked for it.  I think he's to be commended for showing good
     business sense in offering refunds.  There are lots of FD users
     who still have to communicate with SEAdog users, and will find
     it very inconvenient to run the new Front Door.

     So, if you're one of those FD users that are dissatisfied with
     the lack of BARK request of SEAlink support, and would like a
     refund, contact Joaquim Homrighausen at 1:135/20.  It's to his
     credit that he's willing to return your money if you don't like
     his product.  Too many businesses wouldn't do that these days.
