by Tom Jennings (1:1/1)

Some interesting articles this week... I'll let them speak for
themselves. FidoNet is rapidly becoming part of the world-wide
networking world, in some cases dragged kicking and screaming, but
mostly quite enthusiastically. Personally, I think it's great, the
more connectivity the better. It does bring with it all sorts of
problems, technical and otherwise, but hey, this *is* an experimental
amateur (in the nicest sense of that word) network. Change is our
middle name (if we could only figger out what our first and last names
are...).

                             * * * * *

WHINE MODE:

OK, I give up. I admit defeat. I cannot win. Stupidity rules the
planet.

I have applied for another node number for FidoNews, to replace 1:1/1.
I have also suggested that 1:1/1 be set aside for time immemorial. It
is the algorithmic "zone gate for zone 1 messages to zone 1", which
when you think about it is crazy, which is exactly the point -- BRANE
DED programs and their mental-equiv. sysops send echo tosses to 1:1/1
when the program and/or the sysop screws up. Which is a lot. Over 300
messages this week alone. It is most annoying.

Thank you, thank you, author of MBOUNCE. My solution: I MBOUNCE the
offenders bad mail, and mark it all for HOLD, so the next time I get a
bucket of crud, they get to pick it all back up, on their dime (dollar
(mark (yen (guilder (whatever))))). Annoying! Once they get a bundle
back, the problem magically disappears. (I tried sending messages to
the sysop, to no avail.)

WHINE OFF:

I wonder if this happens to 2:2/2, 3:3/3... as well.

Introduction
------------

A number of the FidoNet zonegates tunnel FidoNet-FidoNet traffic over the
Internet's intercontinental TCP/IP links.  This note is a short technical
explanation of how it is done.  For the purposes of this note, it will be
assumed that you are familiar with FidoNet, TCP/IP, the Internet, and odd
bits of MS-DOS and uucp cruft.


Legalities
----------

FidoNet owes very deep appreciation to the IP networks which have consented
to the tunneling of FidoNet traffic through them.

FidoNet has a long-standing written agreement with the Internet not to use
the Internet for FidoNet-FidoNet traffic without explicit consent.  It is
exceedingly important to note that the tunneling discussed in this note is
done with the explicit consent and encouragement of the owners of the IP
links concerned, e.g. EUnet and UNINET-ZA.  It is also of note that it has
been agreed that the traffic on the link between Europe and North America
will not 'compete' with EUnet, i.e. carry traffic which should, more
appropriately, be gotten from EUnet directly, such as Internet mailing
lists, MBAS file requests, ...


Overview
--------

A goal of the hack is to make it appear as if the two FidoNet systems had
actually communicated the 'normal' way by telephone.  Hence gating, in the
UFGATE sense, is not done.  Instead, packed and compressed FidoNet files
(xxxxyyyy.MOn) are magically moved from the sending node's outbound
directory to the receiving node's inbound.  They are then unpacked as if
they had been transported by phone.

Files are transported by moving the data from the sending FidoNet node to a
nearby UNIX<tm> host which is on the Internet.  The UNIX host then sends
the file to a distant UNIX host which, in turn, transfers it to the distant
FidoNet node.

FidoNews 9-44                  Page 3                       2 Nov 1992


Different transports may be used between the FidoNet node and its local
UNIX host.  Sending and receiving scripts are run on the UNIX hosts in
order to acommodate these differences.  In the examples below, it will be
assumed that the FidoNet node is on a local ether with its local UNIX host,
but there are cases where the connection is via uucp etc.

In order that the file can be routed by the distant UNIX system to the
target FidoNet node, special processing and routing needs to be done by the
receiving UNIX system.  Hence, inter-UNIX transport by ftp or rcp is
inappropriate, and uucp over TCP/IP, aka UUCP-t, is used, so that a command
script may be uuxqted against the data file on the target host.


The Fidonet Node
--- ------- ----

On the local FidoNet node, mail and echomail are processed in the normal
manner using normal FidoNet tools.  I happen to use Binkley and QM because
of their excellent standards conformity and their attempt to work well
despite some of the non-conforming brain-damaged implementations out there.
1:105/42 uses FTP Software's excellent PC/TCP package for IP communication
with the local SUN UNIX host rain.psg.com.  Thus 1:105/42 can rcp, rsh,
etc. to its ether neighbor.

On 1:105/42, the FidoNet node actually used as the zonegate, QM packs the
mail and echomail for the target FidoNet node in an outbound directory as a
uniquely named file, xxxxyyyy.MO?.  As there are only ten possible unique
files of this form in any one day, *.MO[0-9], the outbound processing of
the file is done ten or less times in any one day, and is therefore run
from Binkley's event management system.  So, ten times a day, 1:105/42 runs
the following .BATch file for each of the tunneled connections:

    : %1 - outbound directory
    : %2 - .MOn filename in outbound
    : %3 - target UNIX Internet host
    : %4 - script name on target UNIX Internet host
    : %5 - .flo filename in outbound
    : %6 - target FidoNet node on the other side of %3
    :
    : load ether driver and move to outbound directory
    3c500
    h:
    cd %1
    if not exist %2.* goto noout
    :
    : send the outbound files
    for %%i in (%2.*) do call bink2eux 2fidoeu %%i %3 %4 %6
    del %5.?lo
    :
    :noout
    : go to inbound directory
FidoNews 9-44                  Page 4                       2 Nov 1992


    cd h:\105-42
    l:
    cd l:\105-42\files\net\europe
    :receive inbound files
    rcp -b fido@rain.psg.com:%3/* .
    for %%i in (*.*) do rsh rain.psg.com -l fido rm %3/%%i
    : move received file to real inbound directory
    mv *.* ..
    :
    : reset directories and get rid of driver
    cd l:\105-42
    c:
    cd c:\105-42
    inet unload

The subsidiary .BATch file BINK2UUX.BAT is as follows:

    rcp -b %2 fido@rain.psg.com:%1
    if errorlevel 1 goto end
    rsh rain.psg.com -l fido fido2uucp %1 %2 %3 %4 %5
    if errorlevel 1 goto end
    : set the file length to zero but don't delete it
    nullit %2
    :end


The Local UNIX Host
--- ----- ---- ----

The local UNIX host, rain.psg.com, is a SUN which is on the international
Internet via UUNET's commercial IP service, AlterNet, at 56kb.  It has a
user account set up named fido, with the directory structure as follows:

    % ls -alg ~fido
    total 9
    drwxrwx---  7 fido     uucp          512 May 30 19:34 ./
    drwxr-xr-x 20 root     daemon        512 May 28 07:46 ../
    -rw-r-----  1 fido     uucp           83 May 23 18:25 .profile
    -rw-r-----  1 fido     uucp           74 Dec 21  1991 .rhosts
    drwxrwx---  2 fido     uucp          512 Sep 20 08:17 2fidoeu/
    drwxrwx---  2 fido     uucp          512 Sep 20 07:02 kudu/
    drwxrwx---  2 fido     uucp          512 Sep 19 21:34 mcsun/
    drwxrwx---  2 fido     uucp          512 Sep 18 07:25 pacifier/
    drwxrwx---  2 fido     uucp          512 Sep 20 04:22 tmp/

The .rhosts file has an entry for puddle.fidonet.org, the FQDN for its
local friend 1:105/42, and the .profile has a restricted path as one would
have for a root account.  There is a directory for each of the remote UNIX
hosts.  There is also, in a directory on the .profile path, the script
invoked by 1:105/42 and that invoked by the remote UNIX system.

FidoNews 9-44                  Page 5                       2 Nov 1992


The script invoked by the rsh in 1:105/42's .BATch file is fido2uucp, and
is coded as follows:

    #!/bin/sh
    FILE=`echo $2 | tr "[A-Z]" "[a-z]"`
    cd /home/fido/$1
    if test -s $FILE; then
        uux - -r $3!$4 $5 $2 < $FILE
        fi
    rm $FILE

The fidouucp script invoked by the foreign UNIX system via uuxqt is as
follows:

    #!/bin/sh
    SPOOL=/home/fido
    SPOOLDIR=$SPOOL/$UU_MACHINE
    SPOOLTMP=$SPOOL/tmp
    file=`echo $2 | tr "[a-z]" "[A-Z]"`
    cat - > $SPOOLTMP/$FILE
    ln $SPOOLTMP/$FILE $SPOOLDIR/$FILE
    rm $SPOOLTMP/$FILE
    find $SPOOLDIR -size 0 -exec rm {} \;


Tying it all Together
----- -- --- --------

Of course, the two UNIX hosts must have uucp accounts for each other which
allow uuxqting of the appropriate scripts, and providing the appropriate
directories, Systems (or L.sys) entries, etc. as usual.

The observant reader will note that the system described above does not
handle transfer of arbitrary files, but only packed and compressed mail.
To make the Internet hack more general, i.e. move more than outbound mail,
we sorely need a DOS command to drive the scripts through the .?LO file in
the outbound directory.  It would be invoked as, for example,

    OFILES <batchname> Z:N/N <more-params>

OFILES invokes the DOS .BATch file <batchname> once for each file listed in
the .?LO file of the FidoNet node Z:N/N as follows

    <batchname.BAT> <znn> <filename> <trunc-del-leave> <more-params>

where

    <batchname.BAT>   is the batch file named in the OFILES command
    <znn>             is the Z:N/N from the OFILES command
    <filename>        is the name of one file in the .?LO filelist
    <trunc-del-leave> is TRUNC, DEL, or LEAVE depending on the .?LO options
FidoNews 9-44                  Page 6                       2 Nov 1992


    <more-params>      are the rest of the params from the OFILES command

What is missing is how OFILES knows if it can delete the entry in the .?LO
file, i.e. if the invoked .BATch file considers itself successful.

I wish to use it, for example, as

    OFILES BINK2EUR 2:500/1 2fidoeu

with the .BATch file BINK2EUR as

    IF NOT EXIST %2 GOTO end                 ; del entry if can't find
    RCP -b %2 fido@rain.psg.com:%4           ; copy the file to UNIX
    IF ERRORLEVEL 1 GOTO error
    RSH rain.psg.com -l fido fido2uucp %2 %4 ; run the UNIX send script
    IF ERRORLEVEL 1 GOTO error
    IF %3 == DEL RM %2                       ; delete   ^ files
    IF %3 == TRUNC TYPE NUL: > %2            ; truncate # files
    GOTO end
    :error
    <tell OFILES not to delete the entry>
    :end

Which would allow one to use, for example, file attaches, PLEASE, TICK, ...
via the Internet hack.  Note that this hack would also allow a .BATch
hacker to drive anything against the list in a .?LO file.

Zone 4 - The Sound of the Whistle
By Clovis Lacerda - Brazil's Region Coordinator 4:80/0

Dear ZCs, IC, Fidonews editor, sysops:

  Our History is full of examples of weak countries against powerful
ones, the force of intelligence against muscles. It seems to be a
tendency that  the Nobel Academy will keep on  giving awards to
oppressed people, like this year's. It is also, at first sight,
beautiful to see a Fidonet sysop trying to bring democracy to his
environment, where people could be heard and respected. What I will
report to the Fidonet community is an example of History upside down,
an example of someone that says beautiful things to the big audience
but uses the most abominable tools he is trying to abolish from
Fidonet. We will see an example of "Do what I say, not what I do", a
sample of intolerance and megalomania.

Zone 4, Latin America, has been used as a laboratory for Political
Science, where experiences are translated into complex sentences in
uncountable Worldpol drafts.  Zones 1 and 3 have been shown to us as
made of dictators, that took advantage of their majority and
implemented Policy4. I am not here to say whether Policy4 is right or
wrong, whether Worldpol is or is not. I only want to report what a
big Fidonet Region (Brazil) has suffered this year. In 1989 and 1990,
our ZC, Pablo Kleinman, started to put in practice his intolerance
against Z1 and Z3. First, he implemented the "democratic system",
where coordinators in all levels were elected on a "one sysop-one
vote" basis, facing with disrespect Policy4 rules.  Nobody can say
that, even though the majority of RC's accepted the system, it was
legal. It is the same as saying that, in a group of 6 people, 5
decided to kill the other, and, being the majority, they are not
against the law. In Fidonews 747, 1990, Pablo Kleinman proclaims:

--start of quote
        General Elections in Zone 4

     FidoNet's Zone 4 "Latin America" has just finished it's first
"general elections for all coordinators" process, where all the
coordination positions were democratically elected simultaneusly.

--end of quote

  This continues in the next years, until 1992.  Meanwhile,
1989-1990, the sysops of Zone 4 found themselves in the middle of a
heavy discussion between Pablo and Bill Bolton.  Even though the
discussion was held in the private zone council conference, it was
being brought to us as forwarded messages. The discussion ended in
the area of racial discrimination, according to Pablo's oppinion. But
racial discrimination isn't anything Pablo should claim in his favor,
FidoNews 9-44                  Page 8                       2 Nov 1992


since (last May) he pictured me and my fellows as "Inhabitants of the
Belt of Complex of Inferiority, where poverty makes people ignorant".
In the Northeast region where I live, thousands of poor children
starve and most of them die. My reaction was insane, and I offended
his Brazilian one supporter in his japanese origin. In the next day,
I publicly apologized. In his attempt to make things different in
Fidonet in such a hurry, he is trying to change the Fidonet netmail
routing, today, with his IDS project. Let's read what he has to say
about this problem:

 * Message originally:
From: Pablo Kleinman
To  : Bill Oxner
Date:27-09-92
Area: "INTERUSER"

IDS stands for Independent Distribution System. In today's FidoNet,
the zonegates don't work, netmail routing host-to-host is deceased,
and all the major echomail distribution systems are conditioned by a
ton of different rules and politics.

Cheers,  -Pablo

* Origin: [-Fiesta-Americana-] IDS - HollywoodCalifornia (1:102/631)

Yes, zonegates, like those in Zone 4, don't work because Pablo took
all the job for him!  Again, I am not here to say whether he is right
or wrong, but how he does his "marketing", using people and putting
one against the other.  But, let's come back to the laboratory, Zone
4.  A brief review of what's happened here in the last years will
clear your ideas.

- 1989 - Pablo Kleinman is the ZC4 since its foundation.
1990 - Democratic elections - Pablo Kleinman is the ZC4 (again)
1991 - Democratic elections - since Pablo was moving to the USA,
finally another candidate could dare to participate. Let's analyze
the facts, according to Pablo's words in Fidonews 822:

--start of quote

The election was done on a one-sysop-one-vote basis, having ALL of
the sysops in the Zone the right to vote. The most encouraging
ingredient of the election that has very much impressed me was the
formidable level of participation: slightly over 80 percent of the
Zone's sysops exercised with commendable responsibility their RIGHT
to vote.

The complete vote-by-vote results were published on the LATIN.SYSOP
echomail conference. Here are the totals:

Alejandro Hopkins received    1.59 percent of the votes
Clovis Lacerda received      39.68 percent of the votes
Gustavo Zacarias received    58.73 percent of the votes

FidoNews 9-44                  Page 9                       2 Nov 1992


--end of quote

   Few days *BEFORE* this election, we were completely aware that I
was not going to win, since our region was smaller than Argentina.
This was also a conclusion from his brazilian supporter, who gave me
moral support: "The most important thing is to participate". A quick
Math calculation showed me that the ratio of the vote the most voted
candidates received was exactly the same compared to  the ratio of
the number of sysops in each region. In other words, SYSOPS IN ONE
COUNTRY WILL VOTE FOR A SYSOP FROM HIS COUNTRY, thus, making
ridiculous this "democratic" system, completely anti-democratic,
considering that countries will be fighting for power in one single
zone. This anti-democratic system has made similar disasters in
Fidonet recently. If you look at what happened in the timetable I
showed above, you will see that *every* year, since 1990, we had
elections.  Nothing more natural than expecting another election for
Gustavo's substitute.  Considering this, we, brazilians, decided to
start a campaign to increase our region, thus, making us the largest
in Zone 4, capable of electing the new ZC4. May comes and no election
is announced. Brazilian sysops ask me what was going on, and I asked
them to be patient and wait. All of a sudden, all Zone 4 RC's receive
a netmail from Billi Cohen, Argentina's RC, asking for the removal of
Gustavo (Pablo's article in Fidonews 934, that goes in the following
pages, gives the reasons, but doesn't say about the deal made, wisely
omitted), and, in the same netmail, he suggests Gamey Garcia,
Mexico's RC, to be temporal in the coordination. I said that I would
not agree, since the elections should have been called already.  He
then says, in his reply, that Gamey would be a temporal, with the
obligation of calling the new elections. Elections that were NEVER
held in Zone 4, since Pablo gave himself the right to interfere in
the process, even being a zone 1 sysop. Does he have the right to
interfere, is it a honest attitude?  His intereference is well
documented with the IC Matt Whelan, in the form of many netmails
requesting Gustavo's removal. Let's see what Pablo has to say about
this, reading Fidonews 814:

--start of quote

         Folks Who Oppose Democracy In FidoNet Are Nervous But...
               WORLDPOL IS NO NONSENSE

     Yes, that's what Policy4 proposes: John ZC elects Jim RC, Peter
RC and Paul RC. And then Jim RC, Peter RC and Paul RC elect John ZC!
Added to this is the fact that then Jim RC, Peter RC and Paul RC go
and choose their respective regions' NCs.  In between, where are the
FidoNet sysops? They are right there: forgotten and ignored. But
according to those that defend Policy4, the poor sysops like to be
forgotten and ignored!  Excusez-moi, but I simply don't buy that.

     But I know very well that across the Ocean, in Europe, things
are different. The two biggest regions there: Holland and Germany,
have non-geographic nets.  Should I, from Buenos Aires, tell the guys
in Antwerpen and Hamburg that what they do is wrong? I rather chose
to sit and watch. It is their experience and if they do it that way,
it's maybe because that is the best for them. It does not and will
not in any way, harm the rest of FidoNet... So why should I complain?

Why should anyone complain?

--end of quote

But Pablo's knowledge of democratic principles is too confusing.  He
defended himself saying that the coordinator would be elected, but
with no limitation in his term! I am still looking for this concept
in my History books. Questioning him why Zone 4 didn't have a Zone
Policy yet, he said we didn't need any bureaucracy, like those in
Policy4 and Zone 1. Let's see what he said two years ago, in Fidonews
814:

--start of quote

     I will probably support establishing geographic restrictions in
Zone-4, when we write our Zone policy. I believe it will be better
that way for us but why in the world should I pretend to indicate
somebody thousands of miles away what to do?

--end of quote

The word "when" is being waited since then. This way, I can only say
that he was neglectful, or probably too busy with politics in Fidonet
that didn't find time to implement a zone Policy, establishing every
detail about this extraordinary democratic system, where the results
are known before the first ballot. About ZC4 Gustavo Zacarias'
removal, he said, in FIDONEWS 934:

--start of quote

The RCs then, after procuring majoritarian support from their
region's sysops, staged what could be considered a coup. Gamey Garcia
from Mexico, was voted in. A P4 impeachment process was then started,
but Gustavo voluntarily resigned before it went through.

No, I hate it. I find it stupid, repulsive, immature, disgusting.
But I'm glad that the attempt to Policy4-ize Zone 4 didn't work out.
It also convinces me once more that until we get rid of it, we'll
keep on having this kind of problems, like Zone 2 is now proving.

--end of quote

This kind of problem is simply made by people that love to play
politics and use others as instruments to reach their goals. Now that
he finds himself "against the wall", with the eminent election of a
non-blind follower, he changes the game with his beautiful speech and
says that the brazilian majority of sysops would create (his words)
"The Dictatorship of the Majority" !! What does he really think about
this? Let's read his own words in Fidonews 814:

--start of quote

FidoNews 9-44                  Page 11                      2 Nov 1992


     Policy4 was written in North America by North Americans, and
while Europeans did not participate or support it, we Latin Americans
were denied a say. And Zone-4 did exist even before Policy4 was
approved.

     Now: is sustaining democratic values a symptom of adolescence?

     I don't know what will come up from the vote, but in one way or
another, they know there is a group on FidoNet that advocates to
democracy and the rights of every sysop in the network.  These rights
include the possibility of the groups of sysops in different parts of
the world to organize and operate according to their customs and not
to which some intend to dictate from some faraway place.

     This ideal, today expressed by the current policy proposal
WorldPol, is likely to win. Sooner or later. The sooner, the better
for FidoNet.

     Pablo Kleinman
     Democratically Elected Zone-4 Coordinator April 5, 1991

--end of quote

For years, we have been obliged to participate in his xenophobia
against North Americans. While the majority was in his favor, we were
playing democracy and it was a great example for the planet.  To make
his arguments stronger, he accuses me of putting "ghost" systems in
the nodelist. But, is there anything more "ghostly" than a sysop of
three different systems, in three different countries, AT THE SAME
TIME? One in Los Angeles, a PVT in Mexico (is there any computer
hooked on the line?), and another one in Germany.  "Party" in Spanish
means "Fiesta".  What a great party, folks!

As one sysop in Argentina wisely said, "Clovis was trying to do
exactly what we did last year". Former ZC4, Gustavo Zacarias, told
me, after resigning, that his "capital sentence" was determined in
advance by Pablo, since Pablo's orders and interference were not
being accepted anymore. One of the orders was the removal of "Clovis'
bureaucracy", like a newspaper editor and an Echomail Coordinator.
Yes, he hates people interfering in someone else's business. "In the
name of democracy", we, RC's, were asked to remove Gustavo and put
Gamey as temporal. How cute! Everything was meticulously prepared,
how stupid I was. I asked myself for some months: Why Mexico? It is
so obvious! From Los Angeles to Mexico, a short trip by bus could put
the two close friends together, and keep Z4 administration close to
home, far away from those "under the Equator". But Pablo's last card
was put on the table, something I have been waiting for months! Now,
20,000 systems can read and learn about intolerance and disrespect
for others' oppinion:

Clovis and Alexandre:

I've seen the nasty comments both of you have made about my person
and I expect a public apology. The insults, more specifically refer
to the VARIOUS comments by Clovis (one of them was "PC Farias a moda
de California") and Alexandre's epithet in a message titled "Japona
Traidor".

I will wait until October 1st for a reply to this message, or else, I
will proceed to file a policy complaint against both of you for
defamation.

I want a full apology on the echo where the insults were written,
with a netmail copy to myself and your zone coordinator.

Thank you.    -Pablo pablito@fido.lu

--end of message

I kindly ask you Pablo: Take me out of Fidonet, the same way you did
with a whole country, Uruguay, where the RC would be the only one
against Gustavo's removal. Uruguay, folks, has been wandering around
Internet, calling up my system, trying to come back to Fidonet, and,
during this time, receiving help from one of the dictators of Zone 1,
that put him in his fdnet.pvt! Yes, zone 1 coordinators are all
dictators. Everybody in Fidonet is invited to try to connect the
following phones, to check things out.

There are two options:

1 - I am removed from the coordination of my country. Like the
episode in Los Angeles this year (he learns too fast), when only
whites judged a black with bad consequences, I know I will be
removed, even before the trial takes place. We do magic in Zone 4,
before things happen, we know the results.  Who will be in charge of
the trial?  PLEASE, do it!

2 - People may back off, "forget", giving us a good reason to laugh.

But, in spite of everything I exposed here, what if I say that he
called me "full of shit... having psychotic problems blurring my
mind"? How can he dare to do that? How come a person, who removes a
message from me, in our private sysop's conference (Brazil),
TRANSLATES it into Spanish (what a wonderful way to bring latin
people closer), putting it in an international conference, wants to
file a complaint against me? Is what he did annoying behavior?

Is Zone 4 Laboratory a big annoying behavior against Fidonet?

Is it really me who has psychotic problems blurring my mind?  Pablo
gives us some hints about who may have these kind of problems.  Let's
read, again, Fidonews 934:

--Start of quote

I'm no politician. But I grew up under the boots of a bunch of
fascist generals, and terrorized by the vice principal's whistle blow
when we were too noisy in the cafeteria or when I ate an orange
without using fork and knife. I was brainwashed with fascist
propaganda by my teacher in 3rd grade, while the commits were blowing
up the front of my family's house with a bomb one night. I was
victimized by anti-semites when I was just too young to understand
what being a Jew was. I guess that at some point it just became
sickening.

People I know "disappeared" for simply speaking their minds. The
worst that could happen to me is being "disappeared" from the
nodelist. I hate this authoritarian bigots and I'm not willing to
deal with the feeling of being "submitted." I guess it'll be just way
too hard for me to shut up.

--end of quote

Please Pablo, I want to be removed. Give us the flag that you always
said to be with you, so much stated in your quotations I put here (1%
of the library of messages I have from and about you), the flag of
Democracy, Respect, People's Determination, Honesty.  Sorry, I cannot
hold this last flag, I am a bad guy, I am cannibal and eat up little
children. Better adjectives about me you will all have the pleasure
to read in the "verbal flood" he will flush in Fidonews, as usual.
Believe in all of them. I must, in advance, say that everything Pablo
FidoNews 9-44                  Page 14                      2 Nov 1992


will say about me is true. He is an incompetent politician, even
though I must recognize in him a great intelligence.

Your vice principal's whistle is echoing everywhere. You claim for
your rights when the whistle is against you, but you have a whistle
of your own, blowing it in Zone 4 for years. Freud may explain it.

As my defense against every terrible detail he is going to say about
my person and the admistration of my country, let me repeat his own
words. Let them echo in every little corner of Fidonet!

Sorry folks, my article was too long. I have plenny of material to
make Fidonews a great success for the next two years. But this is
enough for me. I just want to be a loser. History will bring things

little problem is putting us, brazilians, closer and closer, and
showing Fidonet what it is made of.

OF BYTES AND RIGHTS, by Herb Brody

Abstract:

DO CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS TO FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND PRIVACY EXTEND
INTO THE TERRITORY OF ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS? WE'D BETTER DECIDE
SOON--BEFORE THE SETTLERS ARRIVE IN HORDES.

FidoNews 9-44                  Page 15                      2 Nov 1992


Computer communications make figurative return to close community of
yesteryear by embracing the world through the computer keyboard. Dark
side of metaphor: gain friendliness, lose privacy.

Page 24:

"Computers and electronic communications, with their seductive power
to store and manipulate enormous quantities of information, are
raising threats to privacy that go far beyond the benign meddling of
small towns. Computers linked to telecommunications networks spread
information--and misinformation--faster than it can be managed. As
access increases, so does the potential for loss of privacy. While an
outcast of a small town can always leave, few can escape the
evermore-ubiquitous computer network.

The emerging network is also raising questions about freedom of
expression.  Who can be held responsible for statements posted on a
computer bulletin board? What right do government and private
organizations have to censor 'speech' disseminated over the network,
and to prevent citizens from encoding their electronic communications?


These questions defy easy answers because computers differ
fundamentally from any other communications medium. Telephones permit
one-to-one contact. With broadcast media such as radio, television,
and print publishing, information flows in one direction, from one
source to many receivers. With computer networks, millions of
individuals can communicate with one another more or less
simultaneously. Everyone becomes, in effect, a potential publisher or
television station. Nothing in the present legal or regulatory
framework anticipates such a dispersion of information sources.

Today comparatively few people take advantage of the opportunity to
tap into networks, but use is growing much faster than any consensus
on rules for governing privacy and free expression. As of 1991, there
were almost 60 million personal computers in the United States, and a
PC could be found in 26 percent of households. Many of these computer
users exchange ideas and trade software on local computer
bulletin-boards, thousands of which are linked in a national system
called FidoNet."

[article reports the Electronic Frontier Foundation [EFF] and the
American Civil Liberties Union [ACLU] and Computer Professionals for
Social Responsibility [CPSR] are working to ensure privacy and freedom
of expression do not get lost in the shuffle.]

[Prodigy censorship of messages noted. Alan Westin, professor of
public law and government at Columbia University, suggests a 'rating
system' similar to the one used for motion pictures.]

Page 25:
FidoNews 9-44                  Page 16                      2 Nov 1992


"However, a recent federal court ruling in New York suggests that this
strategy may be counterproductive. CompuServe Information Service was
sued for libel because of information disseminated in an on-line
newsletter. The judge ruled that CompuServe could not be held
responsible because it was not like a newspaper, resembling instead a
bookstore or library. A newspaper publisher is responsible for
libelous statements, but a bookstore owner is not, because it is
unreasonable to expect the owner to review the contents of all books
sold.

This decision means that operators of bulletin board systems
('sysops,' as they're known) can shield themselves from liability by
practicing laissez-faire--letting anything and everything go on-line.
Any service that adopts a more restrictive approach by, say,
prohibiting obscenity or racial insults, begins to resemble a
newspaper and can thus be held accountable.  Prodigy vice president
and general counsel George Perry suggests that bulletin boards issue a
disclaimer each time a user logs on--a statement saying, in effect,
that they can read posted messages at their own risk."

[article continues to address the issues of 'reasonable privacy', the
FBI proposal to build in monitoring capability to digital networks,
Harvard law scholar Laurence Tribe suggests a Twenty-Seventh Amendment
to the Constitution to ensure that protections of free speech and
against unreasonable searches apply regardless of the technological
medium used to transmit, store, or alter information.]

Page 27:

"Right now, anyone in the United States can legally encrypt an
electronic message. This is a relatively tolerant policy; France by
contrast, permits encryption only for government-related
communications. Several U.S. software companies license the the most
advanced and commonly used encryption algorithm, patented by RSA Data
Security of Redwood City, Calif.

Still few commercial products have built-in encryption capability. The
reason is that the United States forbids export of any product
containing the RSA algorithm, and software companies are reluctant to
develop programs they cannot sell abroad. (Ironically, the U.S.
government does not restrict cryptography imports. Thus a U.S. company
wishing to sell cryptography products in the United States would do
best to move operations overseas.)"

Page 29:

"Meanwhile, there is reason for optimism in the United States; civil
libertarians are joining with technologists as the network grows from
infancy.  And computers users are, in fact, a particularly powerful
elite, assuming that the country's economic future belongs to
information-saavy people.

FidoNews 9-44                  Page 17                      2 Nov 1992


Still, policymakers should not be distracted by a misguided focus on
the elites: a universally accessible computer network that citizens
may contribute to freely, without fear of surveillance or censorship,
will be good for everyone. Utimately, computer users are hoping to
create far-flung communities that combine the friendliness of a
pastoral village with the sophistication, tolerance, and opportunity
for growth and new experience offered by life in a modern city."

-30-

food for thought.

if, as the article states, it is legal in the United States for
'anyone' to 'legally encrypt an electronic message', how does FidoNet
forbid such a thing if they are so worried about legal operation?
[grin]

hmmm?

TTFN.

"Industrial melanism" can be just a bit of jargon until you ask a
knowledgeable zoologist to fill in the details.  Then, you can find out
why _Biston betularia_ provides an excellent example of what biologists
today call "evolution".  Along the way, the ecology of visually
oriented predators and color-camouflaged prey items gets explained.
Changes in environment become linked to changes in allele frequencies,
and the whole process starts making sense.  For those with a
mathematical bent, the Hardy-Castle-Weinberg equations for population
genetics may provide some fascinating calculator math in pursuit of
biological relevance.

Or if you are interested by fossils, discussions of taxonomy concerning
our favorite critters from the Burgess Shale will definitely prove
thought provoking.  Is _Hallucigenia_ really an onychophoran?  No, says
Marty Leipzig, despite Stephen Gould's apparent capitulation on the
matter.  And just how large was _Anomalocaris_, the extra-large model
predator of Burgess Shale fauna?  Is _Wiwaxia_ really just another
trilobite?  (Trilobites, BTW, have nothing to do with computer memory.)

Does the speed of light decay, as SciCre-ists Norman and Setterfield
have averred?  Various folk knowledgeable about the fields of physics
and statistics not only say no, but explain why not.

Or did Forrest M. Mims III get a fair deal or a raw deal when turned
down for a columnist slot at Scientific American?

How can you help preserve science instruction in secondary schools when
biology classes are threatened by SciCre-ist dogmatists or animal
rights activists?

Do simulations of natural selection "jam" computers, as asserted by
three-time doctorate SciCre-ist A.E. Wilder Smith?  Learn why "genetic
algorithms" are a hot topic in optimization problem solving, and why
Wilder Smith was wrong.

On all these topics and more, the Evolution Echo helps put you in touch
with folks who either have a handle on answers or who are willing to
help you locate the answers.

Already, the phylogeny of therapsid reptiles, bases of molecular
biology, definitions of abiogenesis, the extent of dendrochronological
timelines, and various other nifty topics have been discussed in the
Evolution Echo.

If you enjoy science and either have a clue or wish to obtain a clue
concerning biology, the Evolution Echo is a place that you should
frequent.

The Evolution Echo is a science echo, which means that flame-fests and
invalid argumentation are discouraged, while the posting of references
and proper arguments are encouraged.  Science also says nothing (and
can say nothing) concerning the validity of theological issues, so
either supporting or denigrating religions is off-topic in the
Evolution Echo.  Those who must make comments concerning religion when
discussions of biology come up are encouraged to continue frequenting
the OPEN_BIBLE or A_THEIST echoes according to their viewpoint.  Those
of you who believe that the tag for this echo should be
SATAN_INSPIRED_CONSPIRACY (Ken Ham, are you listening?) are welcome to
join in, but do remember that the level of respect you give is likely
to be the level of respect you get.  The echo rules are available for
F'Req from 1:347/303 as EVORULES.LZH.

The goal is to make the Evolution Echo accurate, useful, and fun.  The
topics can be both technical and important, but a little levity goes a
long way toward keeping things pleasant.

The Evolution Echo is now available on the Zone 1 backbone.  Areafix

     The first file is the Main Network documentation and the
application is included.  XX is the version #.  The second file
is a listing of all the missing persons files that are

     If you're a user you can also use our network via file
distribution.  If you have a missing person (Family, friend, etc)
just send a color photo, a precise description of the person,
and possible reasons why they could be missing.  Once I acquire
this information, I'll scan and compress the file for you, and
later distribute it to every member on the net.  In turn, almost
every member is running a bulletin board, and the files are
available for users to download freely.  At this time there
is no fee for our network.  No cost recovery system exists at
this time, but in the future it may because necessary, if the
network gets to be as large as FidoNet.
