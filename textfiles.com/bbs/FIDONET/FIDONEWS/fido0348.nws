                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================

                         Welcome to the Big League


     I've just  gotten  back  from  the  Electronic  Mail  Association
     conference for 1986,  and I thought I should say something  about
     it while it's still fresh in my mind (or as fresh as anything CAN
     be after 2 AM).

     The  conference was held in Washington DC,  and was well attended
     by all of the "biggies" in electronic mail.  CompuServe  and  The
     Source  were  there,  as well as Western Union,  MCI Mail,  AT&T,
     Telenet,  and enough GEISCO people to sink a small battleship.  I
     went  in  more  than half expecting to be told to go run and play
     somewhere.

     Big surprise.  My usual introductory line  went  something  like,
     "I'm  from   the   International   FidoNet   association;   we're
     representing the amateurs." My friends, they'd heard of us.  They
     knew  we  existed,  and  they  usually  knew  something of how we
     worked, and they weren't laughing.

     Let me tell you why.  I heard one speaker stand up  and  describe
     his  network.  He  gave  these numbers as if he were describing a
     large network,  and people seemed to take it that  way.  He  said
     they have 250 nodes across the country,  with about 12,000 users,
     and that they transmitted about 10,000 messages a day.

     And here we sit with more nodes than he has users,  at least  ten
     times  that  many users (even by the most pessimistic estimates),
     and moving hundreds of thousands of messages a day.  We are NOT a
     small network!  I'll go  further  than  that.  Based  on  what  I
     heard,  we are probably one of the largest public electronic mail
     networks in the world!

     Oh,  some  of  the  real  "biggies"  are bigger than we are.  The
     speaker for Western Union mentioned 2,500  nodes  worldwide.  But
     does that sound all that big to us these days?

     And  they know it.  By and large,  they know it.  Several times I
     got pulled into discussions with people who mainly wanted to know
     how we could get the kind of throughput we  have.  This  sort  of
     thing was not at all unusual.  It seemed that I could hardly turn
     around  without  bumping  into  someone  that had noticed an IFNA
     representative on the attendance list and who was hoping to  meet
     me.  They were all very interested and very supportive.

     This is understandable,  I suppose,  as it is really the amateurs
     that created the electronic mail industry.  It's  not  that  many
     years  ago  that  electronic mail meant bulletin boards.  Most of
     these companies are copying from us in a big way,  and almost all
     of them are counting on us to educate people about the advantages
     of electronic mail.

     But moving on,  I felt that my reason for being there was to find
     out what I  could  about  the  legal  issues  facing  sysops.  Of
     primary  concern,  of  course,  is the recently passed Electronic
     Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA).  The  congressman  who
     sponsored  ECPA was a guest speaker,  and I managed to buttonhole
     him and his aide as they were leaving, and he promised to send me
     some literature about it.  But as a byproduct of my  conversation
     with  him,  I  quickly wound up in a conversation with two of the
     higher ranking officers of EMA,  including one fellow  who  is  a
     vice  president  and  legal  adviser  of  one  of  the major data
     networks, and who wrote better than two thirds of ECPA,  so I can
     give some pretty certain assurances about how it affects us.

     In a nutshell, it doesn't.

     ECPA  deals  mainly  with  assuring  the  privacy  of  electronic
     communications over secure networks.  Bulletin boards per se  are
     not  private,  and  hence are not affected.  On the one hand,  it
     means that the messages on your board are subject to  the  normal
     legal protections involving search warrants and such, without the
     much stricter controls on such things as wiretapping.  But on the
     other  hand,  it  also means that you are not legally responsible
     for the security of mail on your board.

     You see,  ECPA makes it very difficult for anyone to legally gain
     access  to  private  mail,  but  it  also  makes  the mail system
     operator responsible for  ensuring  that  private  mail  is  kept
     private,  even  from the operator of the mail system.  I've never
     seen  a  BBS  program  yet  where the sysop couldn't read private
     mail,  but that's a no-no under ECPA.  But we're not a commercial
     system, and we're not a secure system, so it doesn't apply to us.

     One  of  the more gratifying aspects of this whole conference was
     the sheer power and magnitude of legal talent  that  was  willing
     and  eager  to  jump  to our defense.  I had to leave,  but I was
     assured that a  committee  meeting  the  next  day  is  going  to
     consider  our  legal  position  in  detail  and draft recommended
     interpretations  of  ECPA  to  ensure  that  we  can  remain   in
     operation.  One  of  the earlier ideas is that they may draft for
     us a recommended disclaimer to help ensure that we are  not  held
     liable for misuse of our mail system by outsiders.

     I'm left with a  very  strong  impression:  The  commercial  mail
     systems  know  that  we  exist,  and are glad that we exist,  and
     intend to help us to keep existing.  It's a good feeling.

                              DoubleDOS & Fido

             David Melnik 107/233 or 1/105  DoubleDOS Help Node

         As many of you may know there are quite a few nodes out there
     that can not have Fido using their systems 24 hours a day.  There
     are some solutions to this problem,  one of which is to run  Fido
     only when you are not using the system.  This method is the least
     desirable  as  users  often  get a no answer and don't call back.
     Also if you forget to put Fido  back  up  you'll  miss  the  mail
     period.

          The ideal way to solve the problem is to have two systems or
     even  better  to be able to multi-task on one PC.  There are some
     excellent packages that can do this like  Multi-link  (See  Allen
     Miller about this),  but for those of us that did not want to pay
     the $500 for it,  we tried DoubleDOS.  The idea of  DD  is  great
     except that the implementation leaves a lot to be desired.  There
     are  many  problems  with  DD,  some can be easily overcome while
     others may not be.  What I'd like to do is first tell you of some
     problems that other users of DD have had and  then  ask  you  for
     help in solving these problems.

     1. Fido  does  not  work  with  DD  version  V.  A  sysop  called
        SoftLogic and they admitted that Fido did  not  work  with  DD
        version V. Has anyone else been able to get DD to work with V?

     2. The  old  problem  of DD crashing when the SYSOP has used CTTY
        and then later switches sections and the system freezes. A fix
        for this was proposed by Gee Wong,  he said that  the  way  to
        handle  this  problem  was  to make sure that there was an odd
        number of CTTYs in effect.  This solution seemed to  work  for
        some  but  not  for  all,  so  does anyone else have any other
        solutions?

     3. Another problem that is very  similar  to  the  above  one  is
        running  a communications program first,  then starting DD and
        Fido.  After doing this  the  system  freezes  completely  and
        requires the BRS (Big Red Switch) to get going again.

     4. Bill  Bolton  brought  to my attention the fact that there are
        some problems with DD and FrontDoor.  He  did  not  articulate
        what these problem are, so Bill if you are reading this please
        respond with some details.



     I  will  collect  and  try  to  test the solutions you send to me
     (1/105 or 107/233) and put them into Fidonews as soon  as  I  get
     them.  Please  when  you  send  your  additional  problems and/or
     solutions please be very specific as to the nature of the problem
     and the system configuration.

     If you have additional problems not mentioned  here  please  send
     them in and we'll try to solve them together.

     Dennis Director, 115/100

                          True Hard Disk Security
                                    and
                          The GUTLESS Trojan Horse

     By now,  most of you are aware of  the  Trojan  ARC513.COM.  It's
     story  is  the latest chapter in the history of vandalism against
     computers.

     The problems caused by this program have been  discussed  in  BIX
     and  FidoNews,  and were recently printed in "Best of BIX" in the
     special edition Vol. 11, Num.  11 of Byte Magazine.  According to
     participants  in  the MS-DOS conference of BIX,  a program called
     "check4bomb" was unable to detect the dangers of  ARC513.COM.  In
     addition,  several  participants  discussed attempts to patch DOS
     software  to  SIMULATE  a  write-protected   disk   by   catching
     interrupts.  Unfortunately,  ARC513.COM  has  not  been  easy  to
     second guess and the complicated interrupt catching often fails.

     I am pleased to announce that there is  now  a  product  to  help
     bulletin board sysops STOP TROJANS DEAD!  The device is call DISK
     DEFENDER.  The  DISK  DEFENDER  is  a hardware add-on device that
     lets you write-protect any Winchester  fixed  disk  on  IBM  PCs,
     PC/XTs or compatibles.  Although there is a compatibility problem
     with  the  IBM  PC/AT,  DISK  DEFENDER  does  work  with  most AT
     compatibles.  It consists of a circuit board which  fits  into  a
     short or long IBM expansion slot and a control box which connects
     via  a ribbon cable (so it can be placed on top of you monitor or
     nearby).

     The box contains a three position switch  that  lets  you  choose
     between  full  protection,  under  which  the entire hard disk is
     write-protected;  zone protection,  which  allows  for  a  single
     partition  to  be  protected;  or  none,  for full read and write
     capability.   Status  LEDs  indicate  when  the  disk  is   being
     accessed,  when data writes are being attempted,  and when write-
     protection is active.

     Software included with the DISK DEFENDER enhances DOS  to  permit
     two  concurrent  hard  disk  partitions,  one  of  which  can  be
     protected using the zone method.  Other operating systems,  which
     support  logical  units,  use  DISK  DEFENDER  without additional
     software.  An installation program displays a map on  the  screen
     to show where configurations switches are and how to set them.

     The  Trojan nature of a program like ARC513.COM could be revealed
     easily.  First,  select FULL write-protection for  your  VALUABLE
     hard  disk.  Then run ARC513.COM with a floppy as the destination
     for files.  When the program tries to write on  your  hard  disk,
     you  will  see  the WRITE LED flash,  indicating that a hard disk
     write was "attempted".  In addition, if and only if the WRITE was
     attempted through the DOS driver,  you will get the message "Disk
     error writing drive C:".  Notice,  the HARDWARE PROTECTION of the
     DISK DEFENDER guarantees that no  matter  where  the  WRITE  came
     from, the LED would flash and NO DATA WOULD BE WRITTEN.
     Fidonews                     Page 7                   15 Dec 1986


     Of  course,  DISK DEFENDER is extremely well suited to protecting
     bulletin board computers during routine operation.  A  sysop  can
     divide  his  or  her computer into a read-write upload area and a
     write-protected area for all  other  files.  HARDWARE  protection
     means that NO dial-up user,  NO "whiz kid" and  NO  software  can
     penetrate your disk!

     Sysops of bulletin boards  generously  dedicate  their  time  and
     their  computers  to  others.  It  is ironic and even tragic that
     these Trojans strike out against those of you  who  provide  this
     great  service.  At  Director Technologies,  we are very proud to
     provide such a powerful,  defensive weapon in the war against the
     Trojans.

     The  retail  price  of  the  DISK DEFENDER is $196.00 and special
     discounts are available for Fido  sysops.  For  more  information
     contact, Director Technologies, Technology Innovation Center, 906
     University  Place,  Evanston,  IL  60201  or call (312) 491-2334.
     Fido inquiries can be sent to Dennis Director 115/100.

     Doug Mohney, 109/74, "The Bear's Den"

                              Computerfest '86

         Computefest '86 is designed to be a gathering of  local  area
     user  groups  and vendors in the Washington D.C.  area,  an event
     where everyone can benefit from attending,  from the  person  who
     knows very little about micros to the hard-core "Give me assembly
     or give me death" hacking types.

         It  will be on Saturday,  October 25,  1986,  from 9:30 AM to
     5:00 PM at  the  Adele  H.  Stamp  Union  at  the  University  of
     Maryland, College Park.

         There  will  be  representative  from  the user groups in the
     area, including Capital PC User Group, Washington Apple Pi, WARUG
     (I hope!), NOVAtari, AURA,  Hyattsville C-64 UG,  Baltimore Amiga
     User Group,  FOCUS,  and Rockville C-64 User group.  They'll have
     members available to answer questions and public domain  software
     available for purchase.

         Seminars:  We  currently  are  in  the  process  of arranging
     seminars on  the  following  topics:  Small  Business  Computing,
     desktop publishing in three different flavors,  Computers and the
     Disabled, MIDI,  Enhancing MS-DOS,  and BBSing and Society,  with
     WARUG's own Kurt Reisler participating.

         Apple  Computer has stated it will send out a speaker for our
     event.  We also are working on getting someone  from  Atari;  I'm
     hoping  Sig  Hartmann is able to do all that he's made reference.
     Unfortunately, Bruce Webster of "BYTE" magazine pulled out on us.
     He's apparently going to Hackers 2.0 instead.

         In addition,  we'll have  a  number  of  local  area  vendors
     displaying their equipment and peripherials in the Grand Ballroom
     of  the Student Union,  for the whole range of personal computers
     currently available today,  PLUS a "Swapfest" where users can get
     rid of their surplus hardware and legally acquired software.

         Why  should you come?  Basically,  this event is designed for
     you to have fun and learn more about computers.  It is  a  single
     day event,  so I'd feel kinda guilty if you came all the way from
     New York or Florida just to say "hi". However, if you live within
     an hour or two of College Park,  Maryland (this means  Baltimore,
     large parts of Maryland,  Northern Virginia),  it should be worth
     your time.

         Admission is $6.00/general and $4.00/discount.  Print a  copy
     of this from your printer & you qualify for a discount. Xerox it,
     give it to your friend Fred & he can get in for a discount.  Very
     easy to get a discount.

         For more information,  contact me (Doug Mohney) at (301) 350-
     1437 (U.S. phone) or send Fidomail to me at 109/74.

                           CALL FOR PRESENTATIONS

     The  Computer  Applications in Social Work and Allied Professions
     Editorial Group The Computer Users in  Social  Services  Network,
     and  the  Computers in Human Services Editorial Computer Users in
     Social Services Network,  and the  Computers  in  Human  Services
     Editorial  Board  are  proud  to announce the First International
     Conference on Human Service Information  Technology  Applications
     or HUSITA, to be held in England in September 1987.

     CONFERENCE THEME

     "A technology to support humanity." Presentations with this theme
     will be favored.

     BACKGROUND

     Human  Services  throughout  the world are utilizing new forms of
     information technology in their work.  The Conference  will  pro-
     mote presentations which describe, define, share, or evaluate the
     ways  that  these  technologies can be or are being used.  We are
     interested in sharing and examining  the  roles  that  the  human
     service worker takes in regard to these technologies,  approaches
     to  training  workers  to  fulfill  these  roles,   and   ethical
     frameworks which providea context for these roles.  Computing has
     altered thework situation and, in some cases, microcomputers have
     made computing power available to the worker and  to  the  people
     that they serve.  The Conference is a place to discuss changes in
     the  work  situation  and  to provide others with ideas about how
     systems are developed.  Workers are  particularly  interested  in
     the  way  that  these  technologies will impact the person who is
     receiving  services:   how  will  they  access  and   use   these
     technologies; what will be their impact; how will they meet their
     needs;  how  will  they network with others or service providers.
     How  can  such  technologies  provide  power  to  the  powerless,
     minorities, women, the third world? We invite presenters to share
     points  of  view  about the development of information technology
     applications in the human services.  The Conference will  provide
     a forum in which we can gather to examine and share applications,
     knowledge,  and experiences,  reassess our concerns,  and provide
     direction to our futures.

     PARTICIPANTS:

     Human services are carried out by different professions  in  dif-
     ferent  countries,  but  will  commonly  include  social workers,
     psychologist, psychiatrists, social planners,  the rehabilitation

           Updates to FIDO modem compatibility information needed

     I have been maintaining FIDOMDM.ARC on 11/301 for some  time.  It
     contains  user  supplied  info  on modem usage with FIDO.  As new
     modems come on the market,  this information needs to be updated.
     If you are using any of the following modems, please send a short
     message to me containing info on:

        (1) Modem brand
        (2) baud capabilities
        (3) Bell and CCITT standards supported
        (4) Cost
        (5) switch settings
        (6) any special modem control file entries
        (7) your name, address and phone (optional)
        (8) problems you might have experienced
        (9) compatibility with other FidoNet systems (SEAdog, OPUS,
            etc)
       (10) any other comments you might have

     Specific information is needed on  Leading  Edge  1200  and  2400
     units, IBM 1200 and 2400 units, Ven-Tel modems, any generics that
     have worked,  Everex modems, Quibie 2400, and any of the new 9600
     baud units that might have been tried with,  say,  OPUS,  which I
     believe  supports  that  baud  rate.  If  you indicate usage with
     SEAdog,  please include your modem  initialization  values.  Many
     users  will  no doubt appreciate your taking a moment to do this.
     Best Wishes for a Merry Christmas to All, Bill Allbritten, sysop,

     Edward M. Rauh, 141/215

                         IFNA is not International!

     In my efforts to present the drawbacks of making the IFNA a truly
     International organization,  I wrote a  minority  position  paper
     suggesting   that   the  IFNA  limit  itself  to  North  American
     membership.  This document,  included in  FidoNews,  demonstrated
     why I felt that we should limit our International membership.  It
     did not,  in any way,  represent the view of the vast majority of
     the By-laws and Rules Committee;  in fact, I was the only one who
     took  this  position.  I  would  like  to  clarify  the  position
     further.  Please be aware that this was drafted by me without the
     consultation of the Board of Directors or the By-laws  and  Rules
     Committee; this document is my personal response to the issues at
     hand.

     1) Why the By-laws document is unfair to International members.

        The document,  as drawn up during the committee meeting in New
        Hampshire,  assumes geographic representation in the Board  of
        Directors.  By  grouping  the  International  nodes  into U.S.
        geographic areas,  we denied those  sysops  outside  of  North
        America  (aside  from Europe,  which was the basis of my legal
        objection)  that  representation.   This  was  done  for   two
        reasons:  first, to avoid gerrymandering (one suggestion, shot
        down early Saturday morning,  would have attempted  to  create
        proportional representation, with all the border line disputes
        that entails),  and second, to avoid an inevitable bloating of
        the Board of Directors.  I feel that the second  is  the  more
        important of the two;  the Board that we recommended,  with 22
        members,  was too large to work  with  as  it  was.  A  larger
        board,  as  would  have  been mandated by allowing each nation
        listed in the nodelist to have it's own representative,  would
        have  even  less  of  a  chance  to  take effective and timely
        action.

     2) What my position paper really was.

        My commentary, added after the fact to present my case AGAINST
        trying to make IFNA a truly  International  organization,  was
        drawn  up  to  present  my feelings on a significant issue.  I
        cannot say  that  it  was  done  to  attempt  to  address  the
        inequities cited above;  it was,  in fact, drawn up to attempt
        to limit the potential criminal liabilities that  I  perceived
        from  the  (possibly)  illegal  activities  of  some non-North
        American nodes.  It did,  indirectly,  allow the International
        members  to  be  associate  members,  and  to create their own
        organizations,  which,  if operated within the laws  of  their
        respective  nations,  could  petition  for  divisional  status
        within the IFNA.

     3) What can be done about the inequities.

        After receiving a letter from Alan Salmon of 155/229, I gave a
        great deal of thought to how  to  redress  this  problem.  Mr.
     Fidonews                     Page 15                  15 Dec 1986


        Salmon suggested the following:

        a. That  we rename the organization the North American FidoNet
           association.  In view of  the  above  arguments,  I  cannot
           contest  this  within  the  context  of  the  current  IFNA
           situation.

        b. That  we  take  into  account  the   International   nodes,
           representing  more  than 10% of our current Net,  and allow
           them a say in the operation  of  the  Net.  This  again  is
           reasonable.

        It is apparent that the International nodes,  which have their
        own needs relating solely to their  geographic  areas,  should
        have a say in how the Net works,  and should be represented in
        the  International  Board  of  Directors.   It  may  then   be
        necessary to create a separate organization to administer each
        nation's nodes, and to treat International communications as a
        subject beyond the scope of the present organization.  If this
        is  the  case,  the present Board of Directors might recommend
        the following:

        a. That the administration of the nodelist be done outside  of
           the scope of the IFNA as presently conceived;

        b. That  the  vote,  to  be  taken on or about 1 January 1987,
           include a referendum on whether the  organization  as  such
           should  call  itself the International FidoNet Association,
           or should indicate the geographic bounds of the majority of
           it's members to date;

        c. That each major geographic  region  outside  of  the  North
           American  continent  form  it's  own national or geographic
           FidoNet  Association  (hereafter  read   national   FidoNet
           Association);

        d. That   a   separate  committee  on  International  Affairs,
           including members from each of the major  geographic  areas
           outside of North America, be formed to consider how best to
           organize    communications    between    national   FidoNet
           Associations;

        e. That the creation and  distribution  of  the  International
           Nodelist   be   jointly  funded  by  the  national  FidoNet
           Associations through  the  auspices  of  the  International
           Affairs Committee.

     These suggestions would probably fragment the Net to some degree,
     at  least  until  each  member  nation formed and funded it's own
     organization.  In the interrim,  I suggest that the present group
     maintaining Net communications continue to do so, for a period to
     be  specified  by a vote of the Board of Directors of whatever we
     decide to call ourselves.

     In summary,  no matter what the organization is  called,  or  how
     representation  is  accomplished,  we  ARE,  for  the  moment  an
     Fidonews                     Page 16                  15 Dec 1986


     International organization.  There are inequities in the  present
     organizational  scheme  for  those  nodes  outside  of  the North
     American continent that may not give them adequate repesentation.
     We should try to address the needs of these  International  nodes
     in as fair a fashion as possible,  while allowing some continuity
     of  Net  operations,   and  attempt   to   give   them   adequate
     representation  in  the  International organization that the IFNA
     hopes to be.

     Dear Fido Sysop,

          We would appreciate  your  comments  and  opinions  on  this
     matter.

          Would  you  purchase  a  HIGH-QUALITY on-line adventure game
     which is ONLY available to IBM-based sysops such as yourself?  If
     so, would you make this game(s) available to your users as either
     a free service or a subscription feature?  Remember, this game(s)
     would be available ONLY for on-line use through  utilities  using
     the "Outside" option of FIDO.

          Any comments or opinions are greatly appreciated.

          Please respond to:

     John Herro, 107/211

                  User's Review of PC-WRITE With Spelling

     (The  author  has no connection with Quicksoft,  the producers of
     PC-WRITE, except for being a registered user of that Shareware.)

     The long-awaited version 2.7 of the PC-WRITE  word  processor  is
     out.  Since PC-WRITE is Shareware, you can download it and try it
     for free.  If you have an older version of PC-WRITE, it will def-
     initely  be worth the time to download the latest version.  Since
     I recently reviewed version 2.6 in FidoNews 330,  I will  discuss
     only new features here.

     The  biggest  new  feature is the spelling checker.  This is very
     handy not only for poor spellers, but for bad typists like me.

     I've used three different spelling checkers from bulletin  boards
     before, but none of them compares with the one built into version
     2.7  of  PC-WRITE.  For one thing,  the PC-WRITE spelling checker
     handles words divided by a hyphen at the end of a line,  and  the
     other spellers I've tried do not.  I was tired of being told that
     "tion" is not a word.  Also, the dictionary resides in memory, so
     the  checking  is  very fast.  Finally,  the dictionary is large:
     50,000 words.  I'm impressed that the program manages to  squeeze
     50K English words into fewer than 110K bytes of memory.

     Alternate-F2 brings up the spelling menu.  You can check spelling
     in  three  ways.  The  program  can check words as you type them,
     beeping at you like some of the newer typewriters.  You can check
     an entire document, or check only the word at the cursor.

     When you check an entire document,  the  program  highlights  the
     first unknown word.  You can ignore it, add it to a personal dic-
     tionary,  edit it,  or ask the program to guess the correct word.
     In the last case,  I've found that some of the  guesses  seem  to
     bear  little relation to the word typed,  while other guesses are
     very useful.  After you select one of  these  four  options,  the
     program highlights the next unknown word, etc.

     The  same  four  options  are available when you check the single
     word at the cursor, or when you ask PC-WRITE to beep whenever you
     type an unknown word.

     You can have as many personal dictionaries as you like,  but only
     one  can be in memory at a time,  along with the main 50,000-word
     dictionary.  The personal dictionaries are  not  compressed  like
     the main one.  A separate program is provided to merge a personal
     dictionary  with  the main one,  producing a new main dictionary.
     Dictionaries are lower case; the speller ignores capitalization.

     Working with a large dictionary in memory is a  pleasure.  I  was
     surprised  that  the  program  accepted  "Boise,"  "elaboration,"
     "esc," "Hoover," "identifier," "Qatar," and  "Terre  Haute."  The
     catch is that you can't use the speller if your computer has less
     than 320K of memory.
     Fidonews                     Page 19                  15 Dec 1986


     There  are  a few new features besides the spelling checker.  You
     can now define a single keystroke  to  insert  the  current  date
     and/or time in any format you like.  (Date first,  spell the day,
     abbreviate the month,  two-digit year,  24-hour time,  etc.)  The
     help  file  is  now  loaded only when you need it,  giving a fast
     startup.  Word wrapping can be disabled  without  disturbing  the
     right margin.  More printers are supported,  including those with
     XON/XOFF  protocol.  Finally,  PC-WRITE  can  now  "import"  text
     placed on the screen by another program.

     PC-WRITE now includes a pamphlet, ready for you to print out, ex-
     plaining  the  differences between versions 2.6 and 2.7.  This is
     in addition to the familiar tutorial manual and  quick  reference
     guide.

     If I may say so,  some of you FidoNews authors out there urgently
     NEED a spelling checker!  Version 2.7 of PC-WRITE can be found on
     Daniels-Fido  107/211,  (516)  367-9626,  300/1200/2400  baud.  I
     uploaded the program in two files, PCWRITE1.ARC and PCWRITE2.ARC.
     PLEASE download it and improve the appearance of FidoNews!!

     Still no money or products or software to review <sigh>.

         80386 IS HERE:  BIG WHOOPIE: Microsoft is still working on an

     programs  which  even  challenge  the  current  crop of souped-up
     Super-AT clones will  be  in  1987,  earliest.  Besides,  do  you
     really need a '386 to do word processing,  database work, or most
     normal spreadsheet calculations? C'mon.

         DEEP THOUGHT:  My friend Mr.  Bill is overjoyed  to  have  an
     Apple  LaserWriter  Plus  to  play  with.  He says it is the most
     powerful computer Apple currently sells. Think about it.  Bill is
     disappointed they didn't put a diskdrive.

         80386 IS HERE:  YAHHHHH!!!!!!: If you crunch numbers and want
     to run *practical* multiuser/multitasking systems,  the '386 will
     allow  you to do it,  abet in a glorified AT fashion.  The '386er
     is a boon to CAD/CAM, statistical users,  and fanatic spreadsheet
     freaks.

         Even  though  you  won't  be able to run ADOS on it (Advanced
     DOS), you can get either UNIX(TM),  XENIX (a UNIX(TM) run-alike),
     and  VM/386.  UNIX  is  a de facto mini/micro/mainframe operating
     system standard;  General Motors is going  to  adapt  UNIX  as  a
     company standard. The last time GM adapted standards was with the
     MAP  manfacturing  protocols;  lotta  MAP products out there now.
     Although I think VM is  the  most  grotesque  OS  written  for  a
     mainframe,  it  is  a  standard  and there are a lot of mainframe
     based programs running under VM which would  be  quite  handy  to
     port down to a VM/386 PC.

         WHILE  WE  TALK OF UNIX:  I will stick my neck out on a block
     and say UNIX is the future of operating systems.  Sort  of.  UNIX
     has  been  ported to more chips and machines than any other OS on
     the face of the earth.  If you don't believe me,  why did Digital
     come  out  with  UNIX,  and  why  do you find UNIX running on IBM
     mainframes?

         However,  you won't  have  the  mystical  UNIX  command  set;
     instead, a user-friendly, graphics-based icon shell will sit over
     UNIX;  if  you want C or Bourne Shell,  it'll be a window option.
     Hopefully,  UNIX will be reworked so it will be less  of  a  disk

     hog.

         The  standards  of UNIX will come from AT&T,  but innovations
     will come from Berkie and other Universities.

         BITNET BURNOUT:  BITNET is a network of  over  1,000  mini  &
     mainframe  computers stretching from Japan to Canada to Europe to
     Israel -- with most of the machines on the network in the U.S.

         I've been recently spending many a late evening  on  BITNET's
     version of CB, called RELAY. RELAY has a bunch of jobs which take
     messages  from  individual  sites  and forward them to the proper
     locations.  I've been able to "talk" to females in Ottawa, Italy,
     Texas, Washington State and Portland. Awesome.

         However,  this  form  of chatting is ADDICTIVE.  You can lose
     track of time all too quickly,  intending to leave at  10:00  PM,
     and  suddenly  find it is 2:30 AM.  OUCH!  I've read of people on
     CompuServe and the Source who get turned on by CB -- only  to  be
     introduced   to  $300+  bills  the  next  month.   After  my  BIT
     experiences, I'm not surprised.

         NOT ALL APPLE,  INC PPL:  are weasels.  Had an excellent chat
     with  Kathy  Kinsburg <sp?> of Apple's Higher Education division.
     It turns out she was down in  Texas  with  Ed  Romson  (an  Apple
     person who spoke at Computerfest) for a while,  then went West to
     the Main Drag.

         Kathy was in town to chat  with  U.  of  Maryland  ppl  about
     "Maryland  in the Apple University Consortium",  and MY GOD!  she
     actually seemed to listen.  Was very nice.  One of the  things  I
     said  was  "Gosh,  I  bought  this  Apple  //e  and once I get to
     college,  I find all they support here is Macintosh." She told me
     they were working on the problem.

         A  TALE  OF  TWO USER GROUPS:  Capital PC User Group came out
     whole hog to support the computer show our user group  (PCA)  put
     on in October, with a number of speakers and volunteers to answer
     questions at a CPCUG table.  CPCUG,  based in Bethesda,  has done
     some *great* things with the D.C. community, including sponsoring
     programming contests,  helping out other non-profit organizations
     like  National  Center  for  Missing  Children,  and is currently
     offering a BBS grant program.  I love CPCUG.  It is very  rare  I
     love anything.

         On the other hand,  we have Washington Apple Pi.  WAP members
     have been running around over the past year preaching the idea of
     "user  group  cooperation"  and  an  ultimate  formation   of   a
     "Washington  Computer Society" a la Boston.  WAP voted to come to
     our computer show, but didn't. Nary a one.  We're 20 minutes away
     from their Bethesda office. However, they do manage to make it to
     close  places like Boston,  Chicago,  and San Fransisco,  showing
     what leaders they are.

         But wait, there's more:  After our show, we went to them with
     a  request to update our Mac public domain software library.  PCA

     is composed of a bunch of u-grads (ie:  poor college students) at
     Maryland.  The  request  got bounced around and they finally came
     back and said "Well,  you are already established,  so  we  don't
     have to help you.  Besides,  you could end up competiting for our
     public domain software sales in the future." Oh.  They really are
     promoting  cooperation  there,  yes  sir.  I  guess  they have to
     protect their cash-cows as much as anyone does.

         OK, YOUR TURN:  If you want to reach me,  send me FidoMail to
     Doug Mohney at 109/74.  Or call me at (301) 350-1437. Good gossip
     or demo copies of anything welcome.  Money not refused  (although
     if I get real successful, I may have to give a cut to my SYSOP at
     109/74).

                           +-------------------+

                Part 5: BBS Security (The View From Calgary)

        Hi ho,  'tis Joe from Calgary (that's in Canada,  eh?)  again.
     I'm here this week to address a problem that has recently cropped
     up  here  in  Calgary  (again)  that  has  no  doubt  cropped  up
     EVERYWHERE: BBS security.

        This issue has two major points of view, with a wide range  of
     variance in each: the SysOp's view, and the  user's  view.   I'll
     try to address each, since I'm one of each  (did  that  make  any
     sense at all?)

        The board from which this junk (not the  FidoNews  of  course)
     spouts  is  called  "TC-Link  Fido",  based  here   in   Calgary.
     Recently, a user logged on under the  name  "Cherry  Pepsi",  and
     proceeded to verbally lambaste the sysop and users.  Needless  to
     say, the sysop was NOT  impressed.   Nevertheless,  he  left  the
     message (an edited version) online, and tacked onto  the  end  an
     appeal to the users of the board to help  him  make  a  decision:
     should he continue running an open system?  Or should he  set  it
     up so that all users must  be  verified  before  full  access  is
     granted?  Or should he do the drastic thing, and limit the  board
     to current members only?

        We've had quite the debate on this.  Many ideas were broached.
     From the user's perspective, the idea was that an open system  is
     a desirable thing.  However, the solutions offered to the "Cherry
     Pepsi" problem were far from viable.  From a few sysop's point of
     view,  the  idea  was  that  the  system  should  be  run  on   a
     verified-user-only basis.  Both sides have merit.  After  all,  a
     sysop puts a board online so that everyone can have access to  it
     and use it to its potential.  This is limited  by  making  people
     wait while their memberships  are  checked  out.   Further,  some
     users resent having to divulge information such as address, phone
     number, and real name.  However,  a  sysop  wants  some  form  of
     control on what happens on his BBS.  He does NOT want his BBS  to
     get a bad reputation, which has happened ALL too  often  here  in
     Calgary.  So where does that leave us?

        Fortunately, Fido just may have a solution.  First off, it  is
     up to the sysop how much information  he/she  requires  from  the
     user.  If an open system is desired, the sysop can limit this  to
     things like terminal parameters, etc.  However, from this  point,
     the user can be allowed anywhere in Fido EXCEPT the message bases
     if the sysop so desires it.  THIS  is  how  people  like  "Cherry
     Pepsi" get their  kicks:  calling  up  boards  that  are  "open",
     wreaking a little havoc, and never showing up  again.   Requiring
     that second call will rid  a  sysop  of  most  of  these  problem

     callers.  I've seen this work, and work well, on 2  Calgary  area
     boards.

        My question to you, the readers of FidoNews, is this: What  do
     YOU think?  I am very  interested  in  publishing  some  of  your
     responses in an upcoming issue of the FidoNews  in  this  column.
     If you want your views known, write to me.  I can be  reached  on
     TC-Link Fido (Calgary, Net 134 Node 7).
