     How Much GARBAGE should a person put up with?
     ============================================

     By: Justin Marquez (1:106/100)

     I have  interpreted the article in FNEWS631 by Phil Buonomo as an
     attack  upon  my   performance  in  the  case  of  Mike  Lester's
     excommunication.  This article is my own rebuttal to it.

     I have refrained from  public mention of Mr.  Lester's activities
     while he was in Net  170  because I have had no particular desire
     to embarrass him publicly.  Since  he  has  seen  fit  to  spread
     untruths about the situation, and to imply  that  I  treated  him
     unjustly, I shall now present the story from my perspective.

     If anyone doubts my veracity, or has any  question  about  how  I
     deal with fellow sysops or with NC's (while I  was  in  the  RC19
     job), please feel free to contact ANY sysop in Net  106 or ANY NC
     in Region 19 for an independent perspective.

     I regret the necessity to write this type of FidoNews article.  I
     apologize to  you  in  advance.    However,  Mr.  Buonomo and Mr.
     Lester have publicly  injured  me by impugning my character and I
     do not appreciate it.   Unfortunately, FidoNews is the only forum
     available for my reply.

     It is also regrettably necessary  to  quote some of his material.
     Sections quoted will be marked at the beginning of each line with
     the vertical bar character, as shown below:

     |  More Tales of Horror from the FidoNet *C's
     |  by Phil Buonomo 1:107/583, 7:520/583, 9:807/1
     |  (Whew!  Made it another week!  Guess the RC's don't read
     |   FidoNews, else I'd have been tossed out long ago!)

     No,  Phil, the RC's do read POLICY,  which  is  perhaps  why  you
     haven't been "bounced".

     |quote from national sysop:
     | RG: Tell me, just how many nodes do you know of that have been
     | RG: excommunicated on the basis of a single offense?  Indeed,
     | RG: how many nodes do you know of that have been excommuni-
     | RG: cated, period?
     | end quote

     Nobody that I know has been excommunicated for  a single offense.
     Mike Lester violated POLICY on a number of occasions while he was
     NC170  and  after  he  was removed from that post.   His  POLICY3
     violations included:  - harassment of local nodes whose sysops he
     didn't like,  including  removal  of  some  of those nodes.  (How
     would YOU like  to  have an NC just lickin' his chops and waitin'
     for your system to  be  down  at  ZMH  so  that  you are found in
     FidoNews 6-32                Page 2                    7 Aug 1989


     violation of POLICY?) Don't believe  me?    Ask sysop Si Hawk.  -
     Entering  messages with profanity in a  public  echo  -  Entering
     messages  with  personal  attacks  (flaming)  -  Harassing  voice
     telephone calls to various *C's.  The fellow  who became the next
     NC  got  phone calls in the wee hours of  the  morning.    Lovely
     fellows, this Mr.  Lester and his friends.  (No,  it could not be
     *proven* he did it.  If it could, there would probably  have been
     criminal charges filed.) -  Being  exceptionally uncooperative in
     any number of ways including:  suddenly using AreaFix's add areas
     capability to add 200 echomail areas  and convincing a few of his
     friends to do the same;  convincing  a portion of the net to band
     together  with  him  and  form a separate group  of  "Independent
     Nodes" who were not allowed to communicate with the "regular" Net
     170 nodes;  attempting to wrest control of echomail distribution.
     - Revealing  contents  of private NetMail messages without asking
     permission.  (Some  of  the  things in the Fido News #631 article
     fall into this category.)  - And, of course, his admitted attempt
     to interfere with the NC's system.

     I asked him on many  occasions  to quit his violations of POLICY.
     He *could* have been removed on  the  basis  of  MANY violations,
     long before he was finally removed.

     I freely admit that there was a  LOT  of "NC-baiting" going on in
     Net 170.  I told Mike NOT to  fall for it.  I tried for MONTHS to
     convince him to quit violating POLICY, just because some folks in
     the local net were pestering him.  *C's *must* be  willing to put
     up with a lot of garbage.  It is part of  the job.  If one cannot
     stand  the  heat,  one  *should*  get  out of the kitchen.  ("Two
     wrongs don't equal one right", plus many other cliches....)

     After Mike  was removed as NC, he was given MANY, MANY chances to
     back off and  act responsibly.  Only after seeing him deteriorate
     to serious threats to others was he finally removed.  Was he then
     removed  for  ONE  violation?   No.    He  was  removed  for  the
     cumulative  effects of his many violations  and  because  he  was
     totally unrepentant.  Had he stayed in  FidoNet, it was painfully
     apparent that he would have continued to disrupt  net  operations
     whenever  he  could  do  so.   Even now he  is  still  attempting
     (through  his  spreading  of  libelous  and false information) to
     disrupt Net 170 and Region 19 matters whenever he can do so.

     | 1) First get the NC(me) to route ALL messages for the local net
     | through your node as NEC.

     | 2) Then, using a message editor that dont leave footprints (FD
     | editor), make changes to the messages the NC posts locally, and
     | make sure some if not most are a degrading nature in responce
     | to simple questions.

     | 3) Quietly, forward "copys" to the RC, explaining that you (the
     | NEC)  think the NC is "over the edge" and politlely ask what he
     | can do about it. A voice phone call helps here, if your GOOD at
     | manipulating people. A few of your friends making complaints
     | also helps, no matter how bogus they may be. also, if a node
     | wont file an "official" complaint make one up in his name and
     FidoNews 6-32                Page 3                    7 Aug 1989


     | send it in. (eg. Joe Savard. )

     I have  seen  few  people as good at manipulation of people as is
     Mr.  Lester.    Curiously  enough,  during the episodes involving
     Lester, not once do I recall his mentioning that persons might be
     tampering with his messages.   The  most damaging messages to his
     case were some that he copied  me  on  (in  his own dealings with
     local Net 170 sysops) and which came  directly  from  his node to
     mine.

     | 4) The RC removes the NC for "cause" and appoints the NEC the
     | NEW NC.

     I removed Mike because he was doing many  things  that  were  not
     according  to POLICY.  Frankly, I never kept many  old  files  or
     messages, because I never planned to publicly put him on "trial".
     Now  that  he  has  fired the first volley, so to speak,  I  will
     present the situation as I saw it (and still do).

     | 5) Now your in "CONTROL". Next, start having "secret" monthly
     | meetings where not even wifes are allowed in the room where
     | fidonet business is conducted. ( You should have heard some of
     | the wives outside when this happened.)

     | 6) When the old NC(me) finds out about what happened and the
     | reason why,  he just shrugs it off and says ok, "you leave me
     | alone, and I will leave you alone", Now just wait about 2 weeks
     | and be silent.

     Hmmmmm....  hardly  remember  him being silent, EVER.  If leaving
     MANY  profane, flaming messages  in  your  local  SYSOP  echo  is
     "silence", then I guess he was "silent".

     | 7) Un-rest rules the net, because of the changes that have
     | happened.  "Un-rest" is an understatement, it almost instantly
     | polarized the net. Now its time for some "heavy handed rules".
     | ie: You MUST attend the local fidonet meetings. (only heresay)
     | You MUST get all your echos from the NC/NEC. You can only have
     | 40 echos MAX. If you post in the local sysop echo, it must be
     | a message that pertains to ALL. Messages of a one to one
     | nature are NOT allowed. ect... The penaltys are "you WILL be
     | removed from the nodelist" A threat of having NET 170 removed
     | by the RC also comes in, if the nodes do not "Cooperate".

     My charge as RC included  "keeping your Region running smoothly".
     Many of Mike Lester's tactics were  designed  to  extort  and  to
     control others.  This fellow was on  the  most  incredible  power
     trip I have ever witnessed.  His actions appeared solely designed
     to  polarize the net, to cripple the net and  spilled  over  into
     some other FidoNet local nets.

     | 8) Now, dump on the old NC (me) an echo NOT wanted/requested
     | without  warning or even asking to have the area set up. (100+
     | messages)  ( I had to manually delete them from my netmail area

     Interestingly enough,  the  Net  170  local "operations document"
     which Mr.   Lester used required the local sysops to subscribe to
     TWO echo areas, if  memory serves correctly.  It seems the new NC
     got the idea from the former NC that such was OK.  The new NC was
     advised  by  the RC that "forcefeeding"  an  echo  area  was  not
     acceptable and he stopped it immediately.

     | 9) Now comes the part that got ME ex-communicated. When I
     | complain saying to discontinue sending the echo, simply send a
     | message to the sysop (me) stateing "I'M THE NC, and IF YOU WISH
     | TO REMAIN IN FIDONET, YOU WILL RECIEVE THIS ECHO.

     | 10) When the ex-NC(me) says "ok, fine, you SEND to ME an echo
     | that I dont wish to have, I will place a file on HOLD for you
     | to pick up every time you call. (note: the FILE was my files
     | listing, the one you would get if you requested FILES from my
     | system. Not a mail bomb, or virused program. also, I intended
     | on recieving the echomail to a passthrough area to no one,
     | effectivly deleting the messages.)

     Considering that this incident followed closely on  the  heels of
     another, in which a bosom buddy of Lester  sent a virus/bomb type
     program  to  the  fellow who was NC between the  current  NC  and
     Lester, it is possible that the NC may have been  totally  out of
     line  in  believing that Lester meant to harm the NC's system  or
     that  he intended to impede mail flow in Net 170.  Personally,  I
     believe  he interpreted the threat  correctly.    Lester's  prior
     behavior  and  the  actions  of  his    cohorts  confirm  "malice
     aforethought".

     | 11) The new NC then quietly removes the ex-NC(me) from the
     | nodelist for  that week because he is "annoyed". no warning, no
     | nothing was ever sent to me about this.

     Mike Lester was reinstated while the appeals  were  going through
     channels.  (David Dodell is more than fair  when excommunications
     are involved.  He is so concerned about the rights of sysops that
     he will even allow the real twits to stay in  the nodelist on the
     chance they may turn out to be non-twits.)

     | 12) When I complain again, pass it along to the RC, who then
     | passes it along to David Dodell, who ultimatly, finds that "No
     | one has done anything outside of policy."

     | It happened to me, and when final, 15 sysops, left fidonet 170
     | Now its time for a NEW RULE for the local net. Rule: You can't
     | be in fidonet 170 if you allow Mike Lester ex-NC of Fidonet
     | 170 on your system as a user. (Just ask the sysop of
     | 7:771/208.0 if this is true or not.) The bottom line is this,
     | I was ex-communicated from fidonet simply for saying I was
     | going to "put a FILE on hold". The FILE was NEVER sent, since
     | the new NC removed me from the nodelist. He never called back
     FidoNews 6-32                Page 5                    7 Aug 1989


     | either, after I sent him the message I was going to put the
     | file on hold  for him. So, I never actually DID anything wrong,
     | but i was  ex-communicated for it anyway.  I even ASKED the RC
     | for a REGION number, and it was refused, by saying that there
     | was already an existing net in Tulsa, and I HAD to be in it or
     | not at all.

      Now, why would an RC give an independent regional node number to
      a sysop  whose  excommunication he had just upheld?  Would there
      be any reason to such action?

      Every local Net has probably had cases where a disgruntled sysop
      wanted to move to Regional Independent status.  Even those folks
      who are NOT excommunicated are  not  moved  out of local nets as
      Independents  unless  there  is  a  valid    technical   reason.
      (EchoMail star or backbone systems are one  possible  example of
      valid reasons.)

      Is this man on a power trip, or  what?    Anytime  you  see MANY
      address lines, it basically means this "Lookie here!  See what a
      honcho I am?" It is similar to seeing:  Dr.    Joe  Dokes, B.S.,
      M.A., Ph.D., P.E., D.V.M., ad infinitum

      | So this guy, Mike Lester, gets excommunicated from FidoNet.
      | His network gets so upset they 'vote out' the NC appointed by
      | RC19, who then declares the vote 'illegal' and throws it out.
      | Most of the network then quits FidoNet.

     POLICY3 (in effect at the time all this happened) did not provide
     for  any  voting "in" or "out" of anyone, anywhere.  Neither does
     it prohibit  an  RC from allowing a net to choose an NC.  It only
     said the RC "appoints the NC's".  I suppose an RC could "appoint"
     the person voted for  by  a majority of the local sysops.  We did
     it in Net 106.   POLICY  does  clearly state that an NC must work
     with both the sysops in his  net and the RC in his region.  In my
     opinion, Lester amply proved he was not willing to do EITHER.

     It is also my opinion that only  nets which are NOT in a state of
     great turmoil should vote for new NC's.  You may have a different
     opinion and you are welcome to it.  Certainly  you  can  see  the
     dangers of allowing nets to vote NC's out, since occasionally  an
     NC must make a decision which is both "right" and "unpopular".

     FidoNews 6-32                Page 6                    7 Aug 1989


     Oh, yes, don't miss the fact that Mike set up a  second  node  at
     his  home,  listing  his wife as sysop, for the stated purpose of
     having a second vote, just in case the RC decided to let Net  170
     vote on an NC.  The NC was reluctant to keep such a node  in  the
     net,  but  was  advised    that  as  long  as  it  obeyed  POLICY
     requirements that it should stay  in  the  list.  It stayed until
     she  asked to be removed when  Mike  moved  his  operations  into
     AlterNet.

     Funny  thing,  I  have  yet to see  moderators  of  the  EchoMail
     Conferences clamoring to allow subscribers to those areas to vote
     moderators  "in" or "out".  (I guess they can  still  "vote  with
     their feet".)

     | So we have another case where an RC 'kills' a network for the
     | 'good' of FidoNet.

     Net 170 is not now, now was it ever, "dead".  What DID die was my
     desire to be an RC anymore.  The TWITS won.   I  certainly "lost"
     something  - my zeal to work for FidoNet.  The garbage collection
     routine finally  overflowed.    John  Summers is now RC19.  In my
     desire not to  drag Lester through the communal mud and not spell
     out in public how  poorly  he  had behaved, I set myself up for a
     barrage of lies, such as the ones that Phil has obviously bought.

     If Lester had not been  on  such  a  power trip, then there would
     have  been NO PROBLEM.  He  *caused*  the  original  problems  by
     continuing to violate POLICY.  He perpetuated the problems in his
     attempts to disrupt the mail and echomail in Net 170.

     Let the record show:  Mike Lester was  the only NC I ever removed
     for  any reason other than non-response to calls during  ZMH  for
     over a week at a time.

     | Are you starting to see the danger of living under Policy4 now?

     Curious statement.  All this happened under POLICY3.  What  I  AM
     beginning to see is the folly in assuming people would not listen
     to lies upon lies.

     | This story would be bad enough, but now we learn that after
     | these guys join AlterNet, the FidoNet NC and RC start trying to
     | take over the echomail conferences the 'excommunicated' nodes
     | are contributing to!  Funny thing is, I thought that FidoNet
     | echomail policy stated that conferences belonged to the
     | MODERATORS!

     Frankly, I  don't  know  WHO  "owns" the echomail conferences.  I
     *do* know that  the  moderators  do  not  bear  the full COSTS to
     distribute the conferences.   Once  you  ask  someone to dedicate
     some portion of his resources  to  support  YOUR  power trip, you
     give up part of that power to control.

     I  am  quite tired of seeing  people  flaunt  POLICY,  make  life
     miserable for many other people, finally get excommunicated, join
     Yet_Another_Net  and  continue  to reap whatever "benefits" there
     are  to  FidoNet  membership  by collecting EchoMail conveniently
     elsewhere.   Are there to be no consequences for such behavior as
     Mr.  Lester's?  Is there to be no accountability at all?

     We *ALL* get a partially free ride here, folks.  The least we can
     do is to follow  some semblance of the established rules.  If you
     don't *LIKE* the rules, then you may:

                  - Work to CHANGE the rules while following the
                    current rules.

                              *OR*

                  - Vote with your feet.

     | Well, as a moderator of a number of conferences, I give a
     | warning to any *C that might feel bound to keep ANYONE
     | following MY rules in ANY of MY conferences from posting:

     | KEEP YOUR DAMN HANDS OFF MY CONFERENCES, OR YOU'LL FIND
     | YOURSELF THE SUBJECT OF A POLICY COMPLAINT SO FAST IT'LL MAKE
     | YOUR HEAD SWIM!

         Vweeeet! Vweeeet! Vweeeeet!
         POWER TRIP ALERT! POWER TRIP ALERT!

         " The system has detected another POWER TRIP. Please turn
           off the necessary EchoMail Conferences to reduce the
           noise to a bearable level....."

     | Clear enough?  Good.

     XTAL Clear, Phil.  Please forward a list of "YOUR" conferences to
     me at 1:106/100 and I promise  you,  I'll  not bother you with my
     presence in "YOUR" areas.  Now, I  assume  that  by  referring to
     them as "YOUR" areas, that means you don't  freeload  on the rest
     of us by using the public backbone distribution system to deliver
     "YOUR"  areas?    You  ARE  talking about areas that nobody  else
     spends any of "THEIR" money to distribute, right?

     Say,  Phil....    how  would  you like it if the backbone  system
     suddenly  decided  to REALLY keep it's hands off "YOUR" areas?  I
     know I wouldn't miss 'em.....

     Moderators BEWARE!

     The conference you run may NOT be your own!

     by Phil Buonomo 1:107/583, 7:520/583, 9:807/1
                     (Yup, still here!  I TOLD you the RC's must not
                      read FidoNews!)

     This past week I've received a LOT of mail.  Much of it HATE mail
     from Bruce Bodger's  network, and a lot of it 'thanks for letting
     everyone know' mail from those that were alienated.

     Doesn't bother me, I've  received  hate  mail  before,  and  I'll
     probably do so again.   Since  the  hate mail is so systematic, I
     can only assume it is a coordinated effort.

     Most hate-mail people were complaining that I hadn't 'researched'
     the facts before writing my article, but the fact is, I did.  The
     thrust  of it remains that *C's are trying  to  say  who  can  or
     cannot  post  in  conferences,  despite what the moderators rule.
     This is just plain wrong.  If an 'excommunicated' sysop  signs on
     as  a  user on another FidoNet sysop's board and enters a  valid,
     on-topic message in a conference?  The *C's will KILL it.

     Witness:

     Date: Tue 25 Jul 89 11:53
     From: Jim Dunmyer
     To:   Jim Grubs
     Subj: <<blush>>

      * Forwarded from 1:234/100, EchoMaster, Temperance MI
      * Originally to Jim Grubs, 1:234/1
      * Forwarded by Jim Grubs, 1:234/1, 11:53 7/25

     Well, I pulled a good one again!

     This  thing  aborted  in the middle of the mail transfer this AM,
     and after polling Snyder for the rest of the packet, I discovered
     a problem here.

     During the  recent  fiasco,  I "fixed" things to cover my ass and
     make certain that  any  messages  you entered into echomail would
     not go through here.  I was copying your incoming file to another
     subdirectory,  then  deleting it from  the  "normal"  one  before
     running CONFMAIL IMPORT.  Unfortunately, I  just  discovered  the
     problem this AM and corrected it.   I  moved  all the files I had
     into the proper area before processing, so *most*  of  your stuff
     should  now  be going out into the echos.   Hopefully,  I  didn't
     loose too much.

     FidoNews 6-32                Page 9                    7 Aug 1989


     Jim, I am truly sorry about this!

     END OF MSG

     Now,  here  we  have a case of an echomail coordinator  BLATANTLY
     chopping someone's messages, and then BOASTING of it?

     Perhaps the *C's feel they are above POLICY, now?

     Where will this crap ever end, people?  Don't the rights  of  the
     individual  mean  anything anymore?  What if Grubs were a user on
     another system?    His  message  wouldn't  be  ALLOWED  to go out
     because he USED to be in FidoNet?

     Dammit, everytime I  see  stuff  like this I get riled up.  Let's
     say it one more time:

     CONFERENCES BELONG TO THE  MODERATOR,  NOT  THE BACKBONE, NOT THE
     *C'S.

     Now, while I say this,  I  am  not  trying  to imply the backbone
     nodes of violating that principle.  They supported the "Moderator
     as God" idea at last year's FidoCon,  and  I  believe  they  have
     supported it in the past year.  AND,  if  the backbone nodes wish
     to set up a set of rules conferences must  follow  to  BE  on the
     backbone  (having  a  moderator  is one), I support that decision
     wholeheartedly.  The backbone nodes are THEIR systems, after all.

     So here's the musical question, folks:

     If  the  BACKBONE  does  not presume to 'dictate' (good choice of
     words,  don't  you  think) to the moderators, why should the *C's
     feel they can?

     Perhaps for the  same  reasons  they felt they could 'dictate' to
     Vince and FidoNews...

     Don Daniels, Voting Member
     (at the request of Bob Rudolph, Chairman)
     1:107/210

                        Executive Committee Report

     The question of at-large memberships has been brought up recently
     by several individuals who have wondered why no provision was
     made for them in the current elections.  This report attempts to
     explain that, though you will find that it is a complicated
     and unfortunate matter.

     First of all, it makes sense to look at the bylaw amendment on
     which the whole problem is based:

      1 f) At-Large Member.  To be eligible, an applicant: must be the
           system operator in good standing of a PUBLIC ACCESS node;
           must have been listed in the FIDONET NODELIST for 180 days
           prior to the ANNUAL MEMBERSHIP MEETING;  is entitled to
           one vote for the election of the At-Large Members of the
           Board of Directors only.

     While we're at it, three more bylaws (or portions thereof) will
     also come into play so let's list them here:

      4. Annual Fees
         b) The annual membership fees shall be set by the Board of
            Directors.

     13. The Nominations and Elections Committee shall arrange to
         have a certified public accountant receive and collate all
         mail BALLOTS received prior to the ANNUAL MEETING, and to be
         responsible for the receipt, tabulation and verification of
         all BALLOTS cast before the close of voting...

     11. ... At least forty (40) days prior to the ANNUAL MEMBERSHIP
         MEETING the Secretary ... shall send to every voting member,
         ... a ballot ...

         Note that "BALLOT" is defined:  "BALLOT: A paper listing of
         all candidates for office and issues requiring a vote...".

     [Complete text of the IFNA Articles of Association and Bylaws are
     available for file request as BYLAWS.ARC from 1:107/210.]

     This last bylaw (11) has a very significant impact on this entire
     matter as it requires IFNA to send a ballot (via postal mail) to
     every at-large member, which could conceivably run into the
     thousands.  The Board of Directors was very conscious that it
     would truly be unfair for the dues of the regular members to be
     utilized to pay for the handling of the ballots of those that
     were unwilling to pay the US$25.

     FidoNews 6-32                Page 25                   7 Aug 1989


     Although it may indeed have been the author's original intent
     that this bylaw amendment would result in no dues being required
     for at-large members and in the at-large member being totally
     responsible for any and all costs associated with handling of the
     ballots, no provision was made for such eventualities in the new
     bylaw itself.  The Board was therefore forced to act within the
     bounds of what was actually written.

     Accordingly, the Board in the Meeting in St. Louis, voted in a
     annual at-large membership fee that would cover all the costs of
     preparing, mailing, and processing a ballot.  In determining the
     amount of this fee, the Board simply chose to utilize the actual,
     per-ballot cost incurred during the most recent election, which
     was US$5.77 for the election completed last January.

     From the very first line of Bylaw 1-f it is obvious that an
     individual must make an application to become an at-large member
     of IFNA.  Such application is based upon the requirement (among
     others) that said applicant "must have been listed in the FIDONET
     NODELIST for 180 days prior to the ANNUAL MEMBERSHIP MEETING".
     Now this is not at all explicit in its meaning and has been the
     subject of considerable debate regarding its intended and legal
     interpretations.

     The IFNA BoD discussed this aspect at some length in its meeting
     in February and the Executive Committee has recently been in
     touch with IFNA's legal counsel for his opinion on the matter,
     with the result that it is understood that the intent would be
     expected to be inferred to mean the 180 CONSECUTIVE days
     immediately prior to the actual day on which the annual
     membership meeting takes place.  The convincing argument for this
     point is that if there were to be an interpretation to the
     contrary, then ANY 180 days would suffice and there would be no
     relevancy in even mentioning the annual membership meeting.

     The Board of Directors was aware of this interpretation in
     February, and had realized that there was a significant problem
     in that the upcoming election would be completed some days prior
     to the annual membership meeting, with the result that it was
     therefore expected that no application could legally be made that
     would allow participation of any at-large member in that
     election.  Accordingly, [and, I personally believe, in concert
     with the general feeling of the Board members by that time that
     FidoNet Sysops as a whole had basically chosen, explicitly or
     implicitly, that IFNA was not to have any involvement with the
     Administration of FidoNet and that there was therefore no need of
     having an at-large membership category] no further action was
     taken on the matter.

     However, there has come to light a loophole in the above
     thinking.  You see, due to requirements that the ballot be
     received by a CPA and the difficulties IFNA has had in obtaining
     such services in the past, it had been assumed that acceptance of
     ballots by other than mail would not legally be providable during
     this election.  As it turned out, the Nominations and Elections
     Committee was fortunate to arrange for the services of CPA Robert
     FidoNews 6-32                Page 26                   7 Aug 1989


     C. Halvorsen????? who will be attending FidoCon '89, so the rules
     for this election do provide for ballots to be submitted by hand
     at FidoCon until Noon on Friday, August 25.

     Because the nodelist (89237) which covers the final two days
     prior to the annual membership meeting will have been released
     earlier that morning, it is then theoretically possible that
     someone might be able to satisfy the 180 day requirement that
     morning, qualify to be an at-large member in all other respects,
     and therefore submit an application, membership fee, and ballot
     prior to the Noon deadline.  However, the fact that the IFNA
     administrators who presently handle membership applications will
     not be attending FidoCon (due to personal reasons) still
     complicates this whole possibility.

     Note that in any event, it would still be impossible for those
     potential at-large members wishing to submit ballots by mail, to
     do so and meet the 180 day requirement as the published deadline
     for mail-in ballots is Noon on Thursday, August 24, which is
     prior to the final required Nodelist publication date.

     Therefore, it is now the decision of the Executive Committee that
     the BoD's original assessment that no at-large members would be
     legally allowed to participate in this election still stands, in
     terms of all mail-in ballots.  As to any ballots from potential
     at-large members hand delivered to the appropriate receiving
     point at FidoCon prior to the Noon, Friday, August 25 deadline,
     such ballots would be considered valid provided they are
     accompanied by an official IFNA membership application form
     marked "At-large Member" (applications are available in the back
     of most issues of FidoNews), the fee of US$5.77 (note that this
     fee also provides for a(ny) ballot(s) to be sent during the
     coming year), and supporting documention to demonstrate that the
     applicant meets the requirements of at-large membership,
     including being a System Operator in good standing of a public
     access node and the inclusion, without break (yes, we are aware
     that that may prove neither fair nor the intent, but we have been
     advised that it is the present legal interpretation) of their
     name in all nodelists from 89055 through 89237.

     Note that anyone who is interested in becoming an at-large member
     of IFNA for the 1989-1990 time frame must meet the qualifications
     stated in the previous paragraph and should send their
     application to the address provided on the application once it
     has been established that they qualify for such membership.

     Nominations and Elections Committee
     1:107/233

              Report from Nominations and Elections Committee

     As indicated in a previous report, the committee is presenting
     statements from those individuals who have expressed interest in
     serving FidoNet as Directors of IFNA.  The committee has not
     validated any of the material in these reports.  If you are
     interested in serving on the BoD but your statement has not
     appeared herein, please forward it to 1:107/210 immediately.

     The following statement has been edited by the committee to
     meet established size constraints; for full text see IFNA Echo
     Conference.

     ================================================================

     FABIAN GORDON

     I always felt that IFNA should play an important role  - a role
     not solely directed at one particular group or class of people,
     but rather anyone who wanted or needed it.  What we all have to
     remember is that IFNA was originally designed as the guiding
     force behind FidoNet, with many meaningful goals and intentions.
     I still believe in this, which is why I originally joined IFNA
     and recently volunteered to represent my fellow SysOp on its
     board of directors.

     We ALL have one problem, and that is that we do not have
     some central force behind our efforts, holding our hands and
     advising us of what our technical and legal liabilities and
     concerns are.  I firmly believe that IFNA can be such a force.

     [Therefore], the major factors in my interest in becoming an IFNA
     representative are:

     1. To promote the interests and activities of our fellow SysOps
        to the community at large.  Let's all show them how WE can
        help change their lives.

     2. To promote and ease the peaceful coexistence of our brother
        networks, who are also trying to do what we do.

     3. To continuously expand the meaningfulness and integrity of our
        communications and our technology.

     4. To provide an oasis of technological, legal, and social
        assistance for ALL SysOps, regardless of network affiliation.

     5. To provide an mechanism whereby all SysOps can unite and

        provide a powerful force which will fight for our rights and
        privileges.
