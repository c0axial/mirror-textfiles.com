     John Hamilton 1/117 FIDO Help!


                      Fido v12 Support Echo Conference

     Just a reminder to all SysOps running Fido v12 that there  is  an
     echomail conference dedicated to supporting you,  named FIDO.  It
     is carried on the backbone  nationally,  and  has  Tom  Jennings'
     active participation.

     If  you  have  enhancements you would like to see incorporated in
     future releases,  just netmail them to me at  1/117  and  I  will
     include  them  in a list which will be forwarded to Tom from time
     to time for his comments.  The list and comments will  be  posted
     in the echomail conference every few months.

     If  you  need  advice  or assistance with v12,  and it isn't life
     threatening or otherwise critical,  you can call 1/117 or netmail
     to it a copy of the question.  If we can't answer it, we will ask
     Tom to and get back to you.  This way,  we can hopefully give  TJ
     more time to relax (ha!).

     I  would  like  to make an open request to all utility authors to
     consider  v12  when  they  are  enhancing  current  programs   or
     designing  new  ones.  FIDO Help!  is more than willing to gather
     any information required to do this, and to help in any other way
     feasible.  If you have a utility which works with v12  and  would
     like  to  let everyone know,  put a notice in the echo or netmail
     1/117 and we will put it in for you.  FIDO Help!  will attempt to
     keep an up-to-date list of what works and what it does for anyone
     that  is  interested.  More information on this will be posted in
     the echo conference in the near future.

     Finally,  thanks to everyone who has helped to get the conference
     off the ground, and especially to Tom Jennings for being actively
     supportive from the start!

     Ben Baker, 100/76

                       An Informal History of FidoNet


     TJ once told me he began work on Fido around Christmas, 1983.  He
     wasn't sure exactly when.

     In early 1984, I was preparing to put a CBBS on line for the CP/M
     SIG of our  computer  club  at  Macdonnel  Douglass  when  I  was
     approached by the club president to make it a club-wide BBS.  The
     club  had  a  commitment  from  DEC  for  an indefinite loan of a
     Rainbow.  The theory was that the Rainbow had a  Z-80  and  could
     run  CP/M,  so it should be able to run CBBS.  When I finally got
     the manuals for the Rainbow I discovered that the Rainbow's  Z-80
     did  not have access to the I/O ports,  so it could NOT run CBBS!
     I immediately began a frantic search for BBS software which would
     run on the Rainbow,  which led  me  to  John  Madill's  board  in
     Baltimore.  There  I  engaged  in  a  message  exchange  with Tom
     Jennings,  who was frantically searching for someone to  write  a
     comm driver for FIDO_DEC.

     No,  I didn't do the comm driver (don't remember who did),  but I
     did get a copy of the first Rainbow version (which was,  I think,
     originally  intended for John Madill's home machine -- don't know
     if he ever put it up).  By mid March I  had  it  running  on  the
     club's Rainbow 100.

     I  don't know when TJ began numbering Fido installations,  but at
     that time there were at least 6,  but no more than  8.  He  would
     not  assign  me a number until he could "list" me in his informal
     Fido list,  and I did not get a phone line assigned to the system
     until  sometime  in  April.  When  I  could  finally  give  him a
     publishable phone number,  I was listed as "Fido 10," the  second
     St.  Louis  Fido  (Tony  Clark  was Fido 4).  I began with a late
     Version 3,  but by the time I was listed,  I think I was  running
     Version 5.

     In  May,  Fido  began to blossom,  and by Memorial Day there were
     around 15 Fidos on line.  St.  Louis had 5 of them -- 4, 10,  16,
     17  and  22.  (TJ had begun assigning Fido numbers when he mailed
     out diskettes, many of which never did come on line).  Curiously,
     all but Tony Clark were running Fido on Rainbows!

     Sometime  in  late  May  or early June I was talking on the phone
     with TJ and the subject of networking the BBSs together came  up.
     "Wouldn't it be neat if one Fido could automatically call another
     and  send  it  messages and files -- automatic software updates!"
     That night TJ logged into Fido 10 and  uploaded  FIDO_DEC  V6,  a
     brand  new  program called FIDONET,  and a new system file called
     "NODELIST.BBS." With that, FidoNet was born.

     Version  6  implemented  a  very primative amorphous network with
     just one hard-wired  schedule.  Traffic  level  grew  rapidly  as
     everyone  experimented  with  this  new  toy,  and it soon became
     apparent that most of the time we were butting  heads,  and  many
     FidoNews 4-43                Page 3                   23 Nov 1987


     messages never went through.  We needed more elaborate scheduling
     and  some  means  of  defining  message  routing.  But how do you
     develop and do controlled testing on something like that  without
     spending a fortune on phone bills?  St.  Louis which by this time
     had added a 6th Fido (51),  could model a real network with local
     phone calls!  No other city could boast more than 2  Fidos.  That
     is how I became involved in difining Fido's routing language with
     TJ.  TJ  wrote,  we  tested,  we  fed back results and needs,  TJ
     wrote, sometimes two releases in a day!  By August we had version
     7, with its routing language, ready for distribution, and FidoNet
     began to change shape toward what we see today.

     TJ was maintaining  the  nodelist.  When  he  received  a  change
     request,  he  would  write  it  down on a small slip of paper and
     stick it to the wall.  Frequently the slip would  fall  from  the
     wall  and disappear behind his computer,  never to be seen again.
     By September the nodelist was a shambles!

     I'm not sure if we volunteered or WERE volunteered, but Ken and I
     agreed to take over nodelist maintenance,  and on  September  21,
     1984,  we  (well,  mostly  Ken)  published  the first "St.  Louis
     Nodelist." It took us a couple of weeks to weed out all  the  bad
     numbers  and  drop-outs,  but  by  the middle of October we had a
     pretty solid nodelist.  TJ had been bit once or twice  with  fake
     node number requests.  (I'm sure many of you have heard a version
     of the  famous  "little  old  lady."  It  actually  happened.  He
     accepted  a  phone  request  for  a  node  number.  After several
     complaints from the net about no-answer,  he  called  the  number
     during  the  day and got an earfull!) So we established our first
     FidoNet policy:  ya gotta request a node number via net mail.  Of
     course, TJ was still passing out node numbers with diskettes, and
     we  still  had a few bad ones.  It took another month to persuade
     him to stop, and to publish "our policy" in the docs.

     It was October or November that TJ published the first  issue  of
     our irregular weekly newsletter,  FidoNews.  I don't think he had
     ever intended to continue with the newsletter very long,  and  in
     January  he  passed that baton to Thom.  I remember at the time I
     had never heard of Thom  Henderson!  Who  the  hell  is  he?  Ken
     didn't  know  either.  Hey  Ken  did you ever figure out who this
     Thom Henderson is?  What kinda name it "Thom" anyway?

     I think we were in Fido Version 8 when, in the Spring of 1985, we
     were rapidly approaching Fido's 250 node limit.  A nodelist  that
     size  was becoming difficult for one man to manage and still find
     time to kiss his wife occasionally!  Our computer  club  and  the
     local  DECUS chapter brought TJ to St.  Louis to speak at a joint
     meeting on April 10th and the next day we had an all-day  meeting
     at Ken's house.

     After  an  11  hour  session  we codified what was already taking
     place.  With the  advent  of  a  routing  language,  FidoNet  was
     collecting  itself  into local groups or "nets," usually around a
     node willing to foot the bill  for  long-distance  calls.  So  we
     created  the  net/node  addressing scheme.  Node numbers within a
     net would no longer have to be unique on FidoNet, only within the
     FidoNews 4-43                Page 4                   23 Nov 1987


     local net.  Thus the "network host" could maintain  his  own  net
     list.  But  that  still  left  about  100  or  so nodes scattered
     throughout the hinterlands and not  alligned  with  anybody.  The
     net  implied  routing.  How  about a different kind of "net" that
     did NOT imply routing -- a Region.  TJ reached into his  knapsack
     (hey,  that's  the  way he travels,  knapsack and skateboard) and
     pulled out two or three hugh U.S. maps.  We spread one out on the
     floor and with a felt pen,  began  carving.  We  divided  up  the
     country  into  ten pieces we hoped represented more-or-less equal
     populations (at 10pm on  a  Thursday  night  we  were  not  in  a
     scientific mood) and dreamed up names for the ten new "regions."

     TJ went home and got back in the "a version a day" mode.  Ken and
     I  put a freeze on the nodelist and began creating net and region
     files and assigning new net addresses.  By early May the software
     was beginning to stablize and we "went public."  As I recall,  we
     set  June  15  as  the cut-over date to the new addressing scheme
     (with a silent prayer that we could get everything  in  place  by
     then).  We  found ten people willing to be regional coordinators.
     We unfroze the nodelist and gave hosts a  formula  for  assigning
     node numbers (until the cut-over, they still had to be unique).

     Finally  the  the  fateful  day  came  for  us to all use the "3"
     command and set our new net  addresses.  I  was  expecting  total
     chaos.  I  was  not  at  all  prepared  for  just  how smooth the
     transition happened!  Oh sure,  there were a few  stragglers  and
     even  a  few drop-outs,  but still,  one day we were an amorphous
     network and the next FidoNet was partitioned into local nets  and
     regions  -- and the mail kept flowing as if nothing had happened!
     It took a good deal of coordinated effort by a great many people,
     and it proved we COULD function as a body!

     It  was  about  that  time  that  TJ first suggested a membership
     association.  After all,  we had proved we were an  organization,
     so  why  weren't we an officially sanctioned organization.  I was
     originally cool to the idea.  Providing  tee  shirts  and  bumper
     stickers  was  not  the  kind  of  service  foundation  I thought
     appropriate,  so I dragged my heels.  With the  Tsimpidis  affair
     still  fresh  in  my  mind  I  saw a need for a strong collective
     voice, but I didn't have any idea how to get there.

     I'm sure there were events of moment,  but I  don't  recall  much
     more  as  1985 slid quietly into 1986.  A 500 node limit came and
     went,  almost without notice.  TJ said "This new version (11) can
     handle 1200 nodes.  That ought to hold us for quite a while."  We
     coined the name "International FidoNet Association" and used it a
     first  line in the mailing address.  FidoNet began appearing more
     frequently in national publications Like it or  not,  we  were  a
     growing  force  and  we  were being noticed.  Ken began receiving
     donations in the name of IFNA,  and they helped defray the  costs
     of our new-found recognition.

     Two  things  happened  in 1986 to crystalize the IFNA concept and
     one to definitely polarize it.

     First,  an April conversation between Ken and his accountant went
     FidoNews 4-43                Page 5                   23 Nov 1987


     something  like  this:  "You've  got  to  pay income tax on these
     'donations.'"  "But that's not my money!"  "I know,  but what  IS
     IFNA?  Can  you  prove  to  the  IRS that it exists?"  "Well. . .
     er. . . uh. . ."  Total receipts for 1985 were only a few hundred
     dollars,  but still,  that's a non-trivial tax  burden  and  1986
     revenues had already exceeded 1985's.

     Then  in May we were asked by COSUG,  "How would you like to help
     us put on a Sysops' Conference?"  Sounded like a good idea to  us
     and  we  immediately  went to work on it.  Then in July they said
     "Looks like we might have a small surplus.  We will gladly  share
     it with IFNA, but we can only do that if IFNA is a bona fide not-
     for-profit corporation.

     So,  with some trepidation, Ken filed IFNA's incorporation papers
     in late July or early August.  On reflection, we should have said
     "Keep the money -- let's  see  what  happens  at  the  conference
     first." Marvelous thing, hindsight.

     Then came the conference in August.  From that  momment  to  this
     our history becomes a blur to me.  I recall that a self-appointed
     IFNA  spokesman  put  us  in  deeper,  hotter water every time he
     opened his mouth.  I recall that,  with no authorization save the
     aforementioned  spokesman's,  IFNA  memberships  went on sale.  I
     recall  a  disasterous "business meeting."  I recall Ezra putting
     out the fire under the tar pot.  I recall a by-laws committee,  a
     New Hampshire meeting,  a Chicago meeting, flames, counterflames.
     I recall twice throwing in the towel and twice being persuaded to
     reconsider my action.

     But can I put order to all of that?  'Fraid not  --  it's  all  a
     blur.   Another   historian   will  have  to  pick  up  from  the
     conference; one with clearer recollections (or perhaps records).

     Has  it  all been worth it?  For me,  the first two years were an
     unqualified success.  As to the last year,  only time will  tell.
     I think we now have the skeleton of a potentially successful, and
     useful, organization.  Now, lets get some meat on the bones.



                                 Ben

     I  have  told this abreviated history from my own perspective.  I
     have left out many people and  events  really  important  to  the
     development  of FidoNet.  The list is long and I will not attempt
     to enumerate them for fear of omitions.  You know  who  you  are.
     Most  of  you  know who "they" are.  I would simply say to all of
     you -- THANK YOU.

                          FidoNet en Sudamerica
                          =====================

          Today there are five registered Fidonodes in South America:
     one in Suriname and four in Argentina.

          The growth of the net in this southlands is somewhat
     limited by the "deficit of phone lines" (very high in the most
     developed countries of the region).

          Since right now, these countries are having a "democratic
     comeback" (specially Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay), there is no
     control at all over the phone lines and the establishment of new
     BBS is not limited by any political reason (like there can be in
     a country with a dictatorship like Chile or Paraguay, where the
     gov't wants to control all the communications and may find BBS
     and Email as something dangerous).

          You must not expect an easy grow of nodes like in North
     America, it is much more difficult to install BBSes here, and
     that is determined by some facts like the deficit of phone lines
     and the lack of technical support.

          To change that, I (with a group of hobbyists) started a
     campaign to promote BBSes and Fido all over the region.  But
     some things must be done soon:

          - Translation of all the software needed to setup a node.

          - Getting support from the gov'ts and organizations.
                      (we are now working on that)

          The first Fido in Argentina was installed in June.  To
     contact IFNA it took me 3 months of researching at various
     sources including CompuServe and Delphi. I finally found Harvey
     Nehgila (thanks, Harv!) at CompuServe who gave me Ken Kaplan's
     number (I had Fido v10j and its manual was pretty obsolete, I
     tried to call 1-415-864-1418 which said was Tom Jenning's node's
     for a week at NMH without success, until I dialed manually and
     found out that the number was disconnected! I asked San
     Francisco's operator for the new number but there wasn't a new
     number...).

          In June, I started to organize a National FidoNet and I
     convinced four sysops in Buenos Aires to switch to Fido (that
     was in September).  We formed TangoNET for Buenos Aires city.

          Now, there are a couple of nodes working in the second
     and the third largest cities in the country, but as they don't
     have direct dialing to the USA, and we don't have yet an
     independent region or zone, they aren't able to join FidoNet.
     That's why I'm asking IFNA to form a separate Region in Zone 1
     or to form Zone 4, even if there are only 6 or 7 nodes.

        PREFERRED INBOUND AND ALTERNATE INBOUND: A ROUTING PROPOSAL

     (This article is NOT COPYRIGHTED and may be reproduced by anyone,
     in any form, with no strings attached.)

     The present scheme of regions,  hosts,  hubs,  and  nodes  within
     Fidonet was developed in an era when, by and large, all telephone
     costs   were  distance-sensitive  (and  where  the  costs  always
     increased when your call terminated at  a  more  distant  point).
     Even  at that time those assumptions were not always true (due to
     the use of leased lines and the generally  higher  cost  for  in-
     state  calls  as  opposed  to out-of-state calls) but now that we
     have PC Pursuit and AT&T's Reach Out America  plan,  distance  is
     often of no consideration in making modem calls.

     Still,  nets are often arranged geographically, with all BBS's in
     a given region grouped  together  on  a  geographic  basis.  This
     works  well  enough  when  an  entire  net  is located in a major
     metropolitan area, but it often does not meet the needs of Sysops
     in more remote areas.

     The major reason that it doesn't work well is that the  backwater
     Sysop's  HOST  is  probably accessible only via the long distance
     phone system,  and the HOST itself may be in only a  medium-sized
     city.  Consider,  for a moment,  the disadvantages that our rural
     Sysop will face:

      1) He will probably be expected to POLL his host for mail  on  a
         regular basis, even though the volume of received mail may be
         very low.

      2) He  probably  does  not  yet have access to an alternate long
         distance carrier,  let alone a packet network or PC  Pursuit,
         so his calls to the host will be at AT&T long distance rates.
         If the host is located in the same state and is some distance
         away, those rates may be VERY high, even at night!

      3) If  the  host  is not in a PC-Pursuitable city,  other Sysops
         will charge their users to send mail through  to  the  remote
         board (if they allow it at all).  This,  in turn,  will lower
         the volume of received mail, making the prospect of having to
         poll the host regularly even less attractive.

     What we are talking here is COST.  The Sysop who is  out  of  the
     mainstream of traffic may have expenses that are many times those
     of  a sysop living in a larger city.  But inefficient routing can
     also affect Sysops in more populated areas.  For example, if your
     inbound host is a long distance call (and is not PC Pursuitable),
     it's still going to cost you to connect with him even though  you
     may be able to access other hosts (of other nets) for free or for
     less money.

     I'm sure that others have suggested that the whole Fidonet system
     FidoNews 4-43                Page 9                   23 Nov 1987


     be  reconfigured to take maximum advantage of PC Pursuit or Reach
     Out America or some other quirk in local calling rates.

     There are a couple of major  problems  with  that,  however.  The
     first  is  that  if the service that the net is configured around
     goes down or has a dramatic rate increase,  you're right back  to
     inefficient routing (for example, if the proposed FCC regulations
     go  through  and PC Pursuit is discontinued,  I can guarantee you
     that there will be some major changes in the way that Echomail is
     being routed!).  The second is that the geographic unity of a net
     is not something that should be easily cast  aside.  It  is  nice
     (and  usually  very  beneficial)  to be in frequent communication
     with other Sysops in your own area!

     Therefore,  I have a  proposal  that  would  retain  the  present
     net/hub/node structure but would allow calls to be rerouted based
     on least-cost principles,  where the sysop of the receiving board
     is willing to put a little  effort  into  making  it  happen.  My
     proposal  involves new comments in the miscellaneous field of the
     nodelist:

     AI:net/node - An alternate inbound routing that MAY be used if it
     is less cost to the calling board.

     PI:net/node - A PREFERRED alternate inbound routing  that  SHOULD
     be  used by the calling board if it is the same cost or less cost
     than host routing or direct routing.  This might be used when  it
     is  a  toll call from the receiving board to the net host,  but a
     "free" (PC Pursuit, possibly?) call to the preferred alternate.

     In either case,  more than one net/node may be specified.  Let me
     give  a  hypothetical example of how such routing might save some
     money.  Since a picture is supposed to be worth 1,000  words  and
     I'm  tired  of  typing,  please refer to the following diagram of
     nodes in imaginary net 999:

        999/999           999/123         888/888        777/777
        BACKWATER <-----> SMALLTOWN ----> HUBTOWN -----> METRO
            x               x
            |               |             (TELENET       (PC PURSUIT
            x               x              ACCESS)       INBOUND CITY)
          HOST 999/0 (TOLL CALL)

     Let's assume that BACKWATER is at the edge  of  nowhere,  but  is
     within  the local telephone calling area of SMALLTOWN,  which is,
     presumably,  in  the  middle  of  nowhere!  In  our  hypothetical
     example,  the Net 999 Host is a toll call for both boards but the
     Sysop of the Smalltown board happens to be a business owner  with
     a  direct  line  (foreign exchange or WATS,  perhaps) to HUBTOWN,
     which as it happens  is  the  location  of  a  HUB  for  net  888
     (unfortunately, that's NOT part of the same net!).  Our Smalltown
     BBS  operator  POLLs the Hubtown node daily to pick up echoes and
     whatever mail might be incidentally routed that  way.  Meanwhile,
     the  Hubtown  node operator,  which has access to a Telenet local
     line,  places a daily call via PC Pursuit to POLL node 777/777 in
     METRO for mail.
     FidoNews 4-43                Page 10                  23 Nov 1987


     Under the present setup,  both the Backwater and Smalltown Sysops
     would have to POLL their host to receive  incoming  matrix  mail.
     Of  course,  they  could  realign themselves to be under Net 888,
     ASSUMING that the host of node 888  has  no  objections  and  the
     regional   coordinator(s)  involved  are  willing  to  allow  the
     transfer - but what if,  two  months  later,  the  Sysop  of  the
     Smalltown  node decides to pull the plug on his system?  Then the
     Backwater Sysop is left high and dry,  with no connection to  Net
     999 and the possibility of a not-too-satisfying relationship with
     Net 888.

     Let's suppose,  however,  that our Backwater Sysop would take the
     initiative to contact all of the nodes involved and  set  up  the
     following arrangement:

     METRO  777/777 receives mail for Backwater - this in effect makes
     the Backwater board PC Pursuitable for mail purposes - and  HOLDs
     it  for pickup by HUBTOWN 888/888.  HUBTOWN 888/888 in turn HOLDs
     it for pickup by SMALLTOWN 999/123.  When  999/123  receives  the
     mail packet,  he immediately CRASHes it to 999/999 because it's a
     local call.  This much of it is all workable  under  the  present
     system.  The  only  problem  is  that  any Sysop that simply runs
     Xlatlist,   without  knowing   about   this   arrangement,   will
     automatically  route  mail for 999/999 to the Host (999/0) which,
     as noted earlier,  happens to be a toll  call  for  the  Net  999
     boards in question.

     Now,  if  our Backwater Sysop could some convince everyone to ARC
     his mail TO 888/888  or  777/777,  he'd  be  in  fine  shape.  He
     wouldn't  have  to Poll the host to get his mail.  So how does he
     do this?  Under my proposal,  he would place this comment in  the
     nodelist:

     PI:888/888 777/777

     This  would  tell other Sysops that,  if it is a toll call to his
     board,  he would prefer that mail be routed to 888/888 or 777/777
     rather than to the Net 999 Host.  On the sending end, the program
     that handles the mail (that would have to be written to implement
     this scheme) would use this logic to route the outgoing call:

      1) Is 999/999 a local/zero cost call?  If so, direct route it.

      2) Is  888/888  a  local/zero  cost  call?  If so,  route it via
         888/888.

      3) Is 777/777 a local/zero  cost  call?  If  so,  route  it  via
         777/777.

      4) Is  the  HOST  (999/0)  a local/zero cost call?  If so,  host
         route it (the HOST may still receive some  inbound  mail  for
         this  node,  but  he  may  be able to Arc it To a node in the
         Backwater system's "free" path,  if the call is  also  "free"
         for him.)

      5) If  all  of  the  above  are toll calls,  then check the cost
     FidoNews 4-43                Page 11                  23 Nov 1987


         fields to determine  which  of  routing  direct  to  999/999,
         indirect via 888/888,  indirect via 777/777,  or indirect via
         the host (999/0) is the least expensive and use that method.

      6) Where the costs are the  same,  the  first  choice  would  be
         direct  routing.  Since  this  was  set  up  as  a  Preferred
         Inbound,  the second and third choices would be to route  via
         888/888  or  777/777.  Host  routing would only be used if it
         was clearly the lowest cost choice for the sender.

     Now let's change the scenario  a  bit.  Suppose  that  the  above
     diagram  is  the  same except that the HOST happens to be a local
     call.  In this case,  the Backwater Sysop isn't out anything when
     he  polls the host,  so he doesn't care if other boards send mail
     directly to his board,  or  route  it  via  his  Host.  The  only
     problem  with  this  scenario  is  that  the  Host  isn't in a PC
     Pursuitable city, which means that users in distant areas have to
     pay their Sysops to send mail to Backwater.  Now,  instead of PI:
     (Preferred Inbound), the Backwater Sysop would use AI: (Alternate
     Inbound).  This  simply  reverses  the  priorities  so  that Host
     routing would be preferred over the use of 888/888 or 777/777 for
     inbound mail,  BUT if it is a zero cost (or lower cost) call  for
     the  originating  BBS,  it  MAY  route  via  one of the other two
     boards.

     Of course,  the above describes  one  particular  situation  (any
     similarity  to  a real-life situation is purely coincedental) but
     the ability to use the PI and AI comments (one or  both)  in  the
     comment  field  might  permit  mail  to flow at a lot lower cost.
     More importantly,  I think,  is that existing Net bonds  are  not
     destroyed  and  if  something changes,  changing the preferred or
     alternate routing is as easy as making a change in the nodelist.

     Now,  how would a PI:  or AI:  be used at the sending end?  Well,
     the  lo-tech  method would be for a Sysop to manually eyeball the
     nodelist and look for the PI's and AI's.  Let's suppose he  found
     the  Backwater BBS and,  because he was a PC Pursuit user,  could
     call 777/777 for free.  He would then insert a statement such  as
     ArcTo  777/777  999/999  in  his route control file.  Most Sysops
     wouldn't enjoy doing this very much (although they might make the
     necessary adjustments for frequently-called nodes),  so I'm  sure
     that  someone  would write a utility that would scan the nodelist
     (after xlatlist processing) and generate  appropriate  statements
     for the route control file.  Such a utility,  when it encountered
     a PI: or AI: statement, would check the cost fields of the boards
     referenced  by  the  PI:  or  AI:   and  generate  any  necessary
     statements  based on the logic outlined above.  If the board with
     the PI:  or AI:  statements happened to be a Host or a Hub,  then
     the  routing  for all boards below that host or hub would also be
     checked  and  changed  if  the   alternate   routing   could   be
     accomplished  at  lower  cost.   Ultimately,  a  new  version  of
     xlatlist might handle all  of  this  automatically,  or  a  newer
     version  of  the  BBS  or  mail-handler  program (whichever brand
     you're using) might read the  comments  and  make  the  necessary
     adjustments in calling patterns.

     FidoNews 4-43                Page 12                  23 Nov 1987


     As with anything, this kind of alternate routing capability could
     be  misused  (I  can  envision "super" mailboards in the large PC
     Pursuit  cities  becoming  nearly  impossible  to  reach  due  to
     overloads),  so  it  would have to be used with some restraint to
     spread the message traffic evenly.  But I also  think  that  many
     Sysops  would  welcome this method of reducing costs for outgoing
     mail,  while at the same time encouraging a freer flow of mail to
     the boards in the outlying areas.

     Comments  on  this  proposal may be left to me via the BIXNET BBS
     (120/64, 616-361-7500 300/1200/2400bps),  although I really can't
     do  much  more  to  develop  it.  The  idea  is simple,  could be
     implemented  NOW  in  a  limited  manner,  and  when  appropriate
     software  is  written  could  be more fully implemented.  For the
     present, a Sysop could just ignore the PI:  and AI:  comments and
     continue  to  Host route mail,  or could manually make changes to
     his route control file for as many boards as he cares to make the
     effort.  I hope that this idea will  receive  some  consideration
     among those in the Fidonet community.

          So far, so good. It looks like I should be back to my weekly
     schedule for the next few weeks. Not only should I  have the time
     to write,  but I  should also  have a  profusion of new software,
     updates  to  old  software,  and  discoveries.  I'm  beginning to
     discover that  Robert Heinlein's comments on writing are correct;
     once you start writing, you  can  never  quit.  In  the meantime,
     let's get this monkey off my back this week.

     -- Brief (Solution Systems, $195.00) --

          I've been  hearing about  Brief for over a year from various
     sources (friends, programmers, echomail) and decided  it was time
     to take  a look  at it myself. Needless to say, everyone else was
     right. It is a phenomenal program and I  can already  see the day
     coming when  I won't know how I got along without it. While it is
     a  text  editor  (versus  a  word  processor),  it  contains many
     capabilities not  found in  high-end word  processors. It has the
     ease of use of Norton's  Editor,  the  windowing  capabilities of
     Microsoft Word  (more on the new version of Word in a few weeks),
     and  the  macro  capabilities  of  WordPerfect.   Combined  these
     features would  make many  a secretary  drool, yet  it is clearly
     designed for  the programmer.  This isn't  to say  it couldn't be
     used as  a word processor, just that it isn't designed for it (no
     spell checker, thesaurus, etc.).

          One of the first things that will clue  you off  to the fact
     that it's a programmer's text editor is the capability to compile
     the file(s) you're  working  on  from  within  Brief.  During the
     installation  you  instruct  Brief  on  what  file extensions are
     special (C for C programs, ASM  for assembly  language, etc.) and
     what compiler  you're using, it knows about many of the compilers
     on the market today  so  it  isn't  too  hard.  Once  you're done
     editing  a  file  all  you  have  to  do  is  press  F10 and your
     compiler's Brief macro and it will automatically compile the file
     (a  buffer  in  Brief  terminology)  you've been working on. Some
     compilers can coexist with Brief, for others Brief unloads itself
     and  compiles.  I've  been  tempted  to try and tie Brief in with
     Microsoft's make utility,  but  am  holding  off  until  I'm more
     comfortable with  it. An  added advantage  of this  is Brief will
     automatically locate any errors. You can look at a list of errors
     in the current file and jump to the next or previous error. While
     this may not be as ideal  to many  used to  the immediacy  of the
     Quick/Turbo series  of programs,  it can be a big step forward to
     those of us used to printing several pages  of errors  and trying
     to remember  if we've  added 4  or 7  additional lines when we go
     hunting for the next error.

     FidoNews 4-43                Page 14                  23 Nov 1987


          Brief also excels in  it's search  and replace capabilities.
     Where most  text editors  and word processors only let you decide
     if it should be  case  sensitive  and  possibly  allow wildcards,
     Brief  overflows  with  possibilities.  When  you do a search (or
     search and replace) you can enter  an expression.  The expression
     could be  straight text,  or you  could enter  one of the special
     functions within Brief. For  example, if  you wanted  to find all
     the  occurrences  of  "STR(10"  and  "STR(20",  you  would  enter
     "STR(1|20" and Brief would only look  for those  two expressions.
     Some of  the expressions available allow you to define groups and
     character sets. If you were editing a BASIC program and wanted to
     find all  LOCATE commands  that were  using a  variable you might
     enter "LOCATE [~,0-9]" and it would go look  for them.  That last
     example tells  Brief to  look for  "LOCATE " followed by anything
     except a comma or a digit. This is  only a  small example  of the
     power of  these expressions.  Some of  the descriptions include a
     means of defining a range (inclusive  or exclusive)  or character
     set,  a  group  (want  to  look  for  all occurrences of "him" or
     "her"). In addition you can  decide  where  you  want  the cursor
     positioned  after  a  search,  at  the  beginning  or  end of the
     characters. These capabilities are not only  limited to searching
     for text,  but can  be used  when doing  a search  and replace as
     well.

          Brief also has the  ability to  edit an  unlimited number of
     files at  the same time. Each file is loaded into it's own buffer
     and there are several commands that  allow you  to switch between
     the buffers  or load  a new  buffer. This  can be  nice if you're
     working on a  program  that  is  contained  in  several different
     source  files  and  have  organized  your  hard  drive  properly.
     Entering "b *.c" at the DOS prompt will  bring up  Brief and load
     every  file  with  the  "c"  extension  into its own buffer. When
     you're ready  to compile  just switch  to the  "main" program and
     start the compile. All from within Brief of course! This probably
     wouldn't have too impressive except that Brief also has windowing
     capabilities like  Microsoft Word. You can create as many windows
     as  your  screen  will  allow  (Brief  knows  about  43  line EGA
     displays). Each window could show a different (or identical) part
     of the same buffer or entirely  different buffers,  mix and match
     as you  please. I've  gone so  far as  to have  8 different batch
     files on the screen at once in 10 different windows. Granted they
     were all  small batch files, but it was impressive to see. A much
     more practical use would allow a programmer to examine and edit a
     call  to  a  subroutine,  the  subroutine itself, and his working
     notes all at the  same time.  If you  write software  and haven't
     wished for  this capability  at least  once, I'd  say you've been
     blessed (a condition which I decided I wasn't long ago).

          While Brief  is a  "high-end" text  editor, I  believe it is
     definitely  worth  the  money.  If  it wasn't for the fact that I
     depend on an electronic thesaurus and  spell checker,  I would be
     tempted to give up my word processor and only use Brief. Solution
     Systems bills it as "The Programmer's  Editor" and  is very close
     to the  truth. While  it is  definitely aimed  at the programming
     community, I can't help  wondering if  there might  not be  a WP-
     Brief  around  the  corner.  The WP standing for word processing.

     From what I've learned about Brief in the past week, it surpasses
     the capabilities of most word processors in some ways and I'm not
     even close to mastering the product.  The macro  language appears
     to be  one of  the most powerful I've ever seen, and you can edit
     your Brief macros from within Brief.  I'd recommend  it to anyone
     who is  currently developing  software for  a living  or writes a
     large amount of code. I have never before  seen a  text editor as
     powerful as  Brief. Having  seen just  a glimpse  of its power, I
     honestly can't imagine choosing to use a different text editor.

          Brief macros are among the most powerful I've ever seen. I'm
     currently  using  WordPerfect  to  write  these  columns and I go
     through some unusual routines to make an ASCII file that FidoNews
     can accept.  I completely write and edit the text in WordPerfect.
     When I'm satisfied with the column, I use  WordPerfect's DOS text
     printer to  create a file called DOS.TXT. After renaming the file
     to LOVELLnn.COL (with nn being the column number),  I use  a text
     editor  to  take  out  all  the  additional  spacing (headers and
     footers primarily) and the  FF (control-L)  characters. With this
     completed I  have a  file I  can send  off that Thom's newsletter
     generation program will accept. In the past I've  been doing this
     last  step   manually.  In   case  you  have  the  same  software
     (WordPerfect and  Brief), I'll  mention that  I use WordPerfect's
     default page  format and  only change  the line  format to a left
     margin of 0 and a right margin of 64. Sometime  soon I'll include
     the macro  I've written that will automatically do this last step
     for me. This is a good example of how software can make your life
     easier. Instead of taking a few minutes, I'm only going to take a
     few seconds.

     -- Winding Down... --

          Some of you reading  this may  remember the  first "x-rated"
     computer  game,  Softporn  from  Sierra  On-Line for the Apple II
     computers. Well, Sierra has  done  it  again  with  "Leisure Suit
     Larry  in  the  Land  of  the  Lounge  Lizards"  (Sierra On-Line,
     $39.95). Many of the situations seem almost identical to Sierra's
     earlier product.  If you  played it,  you'll have a head start on
     everybody else playing this game. The new twist is graphics, like
     those  in  Sierra's  King's  Quest series. While the game greatly
     resembles its  predecessor, there's  more than  enough new twists
     and turns  to amuse everyone. I've greatly enjoyed playing Lounge
     Lizards and would recommend it to  any adult  game players. Every
     time you  start the  game you  have to  go through  a short quiz.
     After asking you your  age,  your  have  to  answer  a  series of
     questions. The  questions are  based on  your age,  and should be
     fairly easy if  your  claimed  age  is  correct.  If  you  miss 2
     questions or  are under 18, the game exits. While this may not be
     the greatest means of  preventing  "youths"  from  playing Lounge
     Lizards,  it  should  be  adequate for most. I heartily recommend
     Lounge Lizards,  it is  both humorous  and enjoyable  (as well as
     being unusual).

          As always, I would like to hear any comments you may have on
     my columns. If it's a correction or something I missed,  I'd like
     a chance  to set things right. I try to respond to all the mail I
