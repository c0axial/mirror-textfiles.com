     =================================================================


     Lots of folks are trying to get their Webpages linked to the new
     FidoNet WebRing but are hitting a wall.

     The WebRing [reported in 1402], in operation for two years, has lost
     their server and is in search of another. Timing is everything. [grin]

     I received email from the WebRing owner and he advises that they will
     be back in business on another server by next week at the latest. So,
     if you get a server timeout or not located notice when you try to sign
     up on the FidoNet World Wide WebRing, please keep trying or wait until
     late next week. These things happen.

     Also in this Issue is a message from jim barchuk about a new way to
     get your weekly FidoNews via an Internet email subscription. Please
     note the list name change in the second part of the message extract.

     Other than that, FidoNet seems about the same as usual. Nothing has
     been heard here about the status of ZCs or an IC lately. What gives
     guys?

     SEND MORE ASCII ART!! Thanks.

     SEND MORE .BIOs!! Thanks.

     ELIST.EXE - Eudora Mailbox/Message Extraction utility
     Written by Fredric L. Rice, January 1997
     The Skeptic Tank, 1:218/890.0 (818) 335-9601

     Overview

         The ELIST utility displays a list of Eudora mailbox titles
         and allows the operator to select any of them for extraction.

         Upon selection the program displays the subjects of all of
         the messages within the selected mailbox and allows the
         operator to select any number of messages for exporting to
         a straight ASCII file.

         In this way messages received and sent using Eudora may be
         easily extracted from the Eudora mailboxes to an external
         file which can then be manipulated in any way the operator
         needs (imported into Word documents, sent to a FidoNet echo,
         anything you need; use your imagination.)

     Who Could Use This Program

         Anyone who uses Eudora for sending and receiving mail will
         most likely employ the "(S)ave-As" menu option to export a
         single message.  This utility allows easier selection and
         export-to-file of multiple messages from all mailboxes
         quickly and easily.  All of the messages selected are
         exported to the same file allowing all messages for a specific
         subject to be selected and then exported to a single file.

     When Will This Program Die?

         If versions of Eudora come out which allow multiple message
         selection for export to a file, this program will become
         obsolete.  Further enhancements might be performed in the
         future which would keep this project alive -- for example,
         the program could create FidoNet *.MSG type message packets
         out of selected messages in a future version.

     What Is This Program?

         This is a DOS program.  There was some intention of making it
         a Windows or OS/2 program but I wanted it to be DOS only.

     How To Get The Program

         You can FileRequest ELIST.ZIP from 1:218/890.0 24 hours a
         day or call direct at (818) 335-9601 and download it from
         (A)rea 1 -- General Files.

         If you send a message to frice@stbbs.com or frice@linkline.com
     FIDONEWS 14-03               Page 3                   20 Jan 1997


         and place ELIST.ZIP anywhere within your message text, the
         file will be automatically sent to you (unless you have an
         invalid return address in which case the program doesn't
         even try to send it.)

         MagicFile name ELIST will also return the program.

     What Limitations Are There?

         Currently the program displays the first 40 mailboxes on the
         screen and asks the operator to select which one to use.  If
         there are more than 40 Eudora mailboxes, the program will
         refuse to run.  Usually if you have that many mailboxes
         anyway you should create subdirectory folders and logically
         group your mailboxes within them.  ELIST would manipulate
         only the current folder specified by the ELIST environment
         variable path.

         Another constraint is memory.  When a mailbox is selected
         the program extracts header information from every message
         in the mailbox if the program hasn't already extracted the
         information from it.  If multiple mailboxes are selected the
         header information for all mailboxes is maintained in
         memory.  I haven't seen a problem yet however in the event
         an out-of-memory problem occurs, the operator would need to
         simply restart the program and work with one mailbox at a
         time instead of multiple mailboxes.

         If it's a problem, contact me and I'll make a version which
         will discard a mailbox's header information from memory if
         the memory starts to get full.  It's easy; no problem.  I
         should probably do it anyway but I'm a speed maven; if I read
         something into memory once, I don't like doing it again if
         I don't need to.  I don't _think_ I need to at this time.

     Environment Variable

         The program looks for the ELIST environment variable.  This
         points to where the *.TOC and *.MBS Eudora mailboxes can be
         found.  Usually this is either the main mailbox folder or a
         subdirectory containing mailboxes for a secondary folder.

         Usually, if it's the main folder, it would look something
         like this:

             set ELIST=C:\EUDORA

         A secondary folder containing mailboxes holding mail from
         a variety of crackpots (I get a LOT of crackpot mail) would
         probably look something like this:

             set ELIST=C:\EUDORA\CRACKPOT

         If there is a trailing backslash that's okay, too.

         If there is no environment variable set, the program looks
     FIDONEWS 14-03               Page 4                   20 Jan 1997


         in the current default directory for the Eudora mailbox
         files.

     ErrorLevel Values

         The program will terminate with an errorlevel value which
         offers some indication as to why the program failed to run
         properly.  There is a descriptive error message offered by
         the program yet historically FidoNetters and Internetters
         have enjoyed batch-file processing even when an application
         requires operator input.

         Toward that end, the following errorlevel values will be
         issued in the event a problem occurs:

             #define EL_No_Problem                       0
             #define EL_No_Eudora_Files_Found            10
             #define EL_Cant_Open_TOC_File               11
             #define EL_Ran_Out_Of_Memory                12
             #define EL_Programming_Error_Point_One      13
             #define EL_Cant_Find_MBX_File_Now           14
             #define EL_Programming_Error_Point_Two      15
             #define EL_Programming_Error_Point_Three    16
             #define EL_Cant_Create_Report_File          17

     Output of Selected Messages

         After selecting messages to export to a file, the operator is
         asked to enter the file name of where to put them.  If the
         operator hits [ENTER] without offering a file name, they are
         exported to ELIST.OUT as the default.

     Operational Details

         The operator may select all messages in a mailbox for export
         as well as toggle individual messages.  (There's an option
         for deselecting all messages if desired.)  Selecting all of
         the messages in a mailbox and exporting them to an ASCII
         file is quite useful for people who maintain mailboxes for
         specific subjects (such as having a specific mailbox for
         company business, another for tax information, one for
         messages from a mailing list, and another for personal
         business.)

         Selecting and exporting all messages from a mailbox would be
         an easy way to transfer messages received from a mailling
         list to a single file which could be bundled-up and sent on
         to someone else.

     What Does This Cost?

         The program is being distributed freely at no cost provided
         it is not used for any commercial venture and is not sold for
         any reason (or under any pretense.)  "Companies" which "sell
         floppies" with software pulled from what they believe to be
         the public domain are _not_ allowed to distribute this program
     FIDONEWS 14-03               Page 5                   20 Jan 1997


         (either at swap meets or through the mails or person-to-
         person.)

         If I see this program being distributed at a swap meet, I will
         take names and start fucking everyone responsible until all
         the nasty criminals bleed horribly to death.

         I'm serious.  I've been screwed by these mock "companies"
         before and Goat help me it's time to screw back some.

     Source Code Availability:

         The source code for this project is available but costs.  The
         code consists of a single Turbo C++ module and a single
         header module.  The code format and variable naming conventions
         used conform to IBM's in-house standards.  Additionally it
         should LINT-out cleanly enough.

         The cost of the source code is $10.00 George Bush United States
         Dollars (foreign currency is also okay provided it's around the
         same ballpark.)  The source code is shipped on a 3.5inch
         floppy, zipped-up, with multiple copies for safety.  Checks
         okay.  Will also take any kind of books in trade for the source
         code.

                                   NODELIST FLAGS
                                     A Proposal

            In order  to properly  code a function to read and interpret
            the nodelist  flags, several vexing problems arise. The most
            significant problem  is simply figuring out the capabilities
            of the  software running  at a  particular node. In order to
            solve this  confusion, I  propose the following standards to
            be accepted  by the  FTSC, IFNA,  and  any  other  anciliary
            organizations  which   contribute   to   the   content   and
            maintenance of the nodelist.

            First, a  code needs  to be  established for  each piece  of
            NETMAIL PROTOCOL CAPABLE software. This defines exactly WHAT
            will answer  the phone  and transfer  mail according to FTSC
            netmail  protocol   standards.  For  the  current  arena  of
            software,  I  propose  the  flag  and  operand  approach  as
            follows:

                 ST: <- the FLAG, ST meaning System Type

                 Operands:

                 FD1 - Fido Version 11?
                 FD2 - Fido Version 12?
     FIDONEWS 14-03               Page 7                   20 Jan 1997


                 SD? - SEAdog version ?
                 OP1 - Opus version 1.?
                 BT? - BinkleyTerm version ?
                 TY? - Tabby version ?
                 DT? - Dutchie version ?
                 (and others as needed, apologies to those I omitted)

                 Therefore, the complete type flag would read:

                      ST:FD2 for Fido v12x
                      ST:OP1 for Opus version 1.xx
                      ST:SD4 for SEAdog version 4.x

                 This  gives the nodelist processor (and we illogical
                 humans)  a  much  easier  time  in  interpreting the
                 nodelist. I also recommend that the operands be of a
                 set length (in the above example, 3 characters).

            Second, a  PROTOCOL code  needs to be established, using the
            same FLAG:OPERAND  approach as the system type flag. In this
            case:

                 PR: <- The FLAG, meaning PRotocol

                 and the operands:

                 TS - TSYNC          (Fido v11 and v12)
                 SL - SEAdog Link    (SEAdog)
                 WZ - WaZoo          (Opus)
                 others as the technology progresses.

                 The operand field may contain multiple operands, as
                 follows:

                 PR:WZ/TS <- to indicate an Opus system

                 In  the  event  of multiple operands, the most desired
                 protocol for network communications should be first in
                 the list of operands.

            Third, the  operation hours,  as before  in  a  FLAG:OPERAND
            combination as follows:

                 OH: <- Operation Hours

                 This  flag  is  followed  by the operation hours of the
                 system regarding inbound MAIL only. The operation hours
                 are in a fixed format as follows:

                      D.HHMM-D.HHMM

                 where  D  is the day number (Sunday being 1), HH is the
                 24 hour military  hour, and MM is the minute. A special
                 case of the day being 0 means all days 1 through 7. ALL
                 times are EST (purely  arbitrary,  but ALL times in the
                 nodelist  should  have  a  common base reference time).
     FIDONEWS 14-03               Page 8                   20 Jan 1997


                 Therefore, a system which runs national  mail time only
                 would be as follows:

                      OH:0.0400-0.0500

                 Multiple  operational  hours  may  be  specified  by
                 separating the separate time specifiers with a slash
                 as follows:

                      OH:D.HHMM-D.HHMM/D.HHMM-D.HHMM/D.HHMM-D.HHMM

                 Continuous inbound mail would be indicated as follows:

                      OH:1.0000-7.2359

                 It is important to note that these times are when the
                 system  is  able  to  RECEIVE mail. These are NOT the
                 actual operation  hours  of the BBS (if one exists at
                 that node).

                 The  time known as National Mail Hour (04:00 to 05:00
                 EST)  is  automatically   ASSUMED  and  need  not  be
                 incorporated into the FLAGS field. Since it is one of
                 the  baseline  requirements  for  being listed in the
                 nodelist, this assumption is a relatively safe one.

                 Also,  this method should also be used to indicate the
                 time(s) when File Requests are accepted. The suggested
                 flag for  File  Requests is "FR:" and follows the same
                 time specification logic as the OH: flag.

            Fourth, modem flags need  to  be  standardized  (until  the
            modems themselves can be  standardized),  for  a  hopefully
            "stop gap" measure, we could use the following:

                 MDM: for the flag,

                 TLB for Telebit Trailblazer
                 HST for USR Courier HST
                 H96 for Hayes 9600
                 (and others as needed)

                 Only ONE of these modem types can appear per node, and
                 it has  no  relavence  unless the baud rate is greater
                 than or equal to 9600.

                 (This is one of those flags we can get rid of once the
                 modem manufacturors establish a standard.)

            Fifth, the  Mail Only flag. Basically, it need to be changed
            to "#MO"  instead of  "MO:". All  flags which  do  not  have
            operands should not contain the colon (:) character.

            Flags occur  following the  seventh comma in a nodelist line
            and continue  to the end of the physical line. All flags and
            flag:operand combinations  are separated by commas, with the
     FIDONEWS 14-03               Page 9                   20 Jan 1997


            last flag  on  the  line  terminated  by  the  end  of  line
            character. Order of the flags is not critical.

      in its original,  unmodified form.

     VFOSSIL design criteria:

     The VFOSSIL appendage proposed here is designed to be an compatible
     subset of the OS/2 VIO subsystem.  All services are proper subsets of
     the equivalent OS/2 VIO API's,  and if you stick to the services
     defined in this document,  you will be able to compile and run your
     programs with very minor changes in an OS/2 environment.

     VFOSSIL (and OS/2 VIO at this time) only supports text modes.  It is
     possible to use the "set mode" service to set a graphics mode,  but
     that is the only support for pixel-oriented graphics functions
     provided by VFOSSIL.  The minimum environment supported by VFOSSIL is
     a 80 by 24 monochrome text screen,  and any program using VFOSSIL
     calls should be capable of operating within this level of support.  By
     querying the VFOSSIL,  the full capabilities of a specific
     implementation may be determined and used,  but all programs using
     VFOSSIL should be capable of operating with the 80 by 24 monochrome
     text environment.


     The organization of the video screen:

     The virtual screen is organized in rows of columns of
     character/attribute pairs,  hereafter referred to as cells.  The
     characters actually displayed are located on the even addresses,  the
     attribute for each character is located at character+1.

     Regardless of the manner in which the video screen is actually
     organized,  the programmer will view it as a a contiguous area of
     memory,  referred to as the "logical video buffer" (LVB).  The LVB is
     (NumRow * NumCol) cells in length.

     VFOSSIL installation:

     The VFOSSIL appendage is installed via the standard FOSSIL external
     application function.  The FOSSIL interrupt (14h) is issued with the
     following parameters:

                     AH = 7Eh        Install appendage
                     AL = 81h        VFOSSIL application code
                     DX = offset of VFOSSIL entry point
                     ES = segment of VFOSSIL entry point

     Upon return from the FOSSIL interrupt,  the following registers are
     modified:

                     AX = 1954h      FOSSIL signature
                     BL = 81h        VFOSSIL application code
                     BH = 01h - Installation was successful
                          00h - Installation  was unsuccessful

     VFOSSIL removal:

     The VFOSSIL appendage is removed via the standard FOSSIL external
     FIDONEWS 14-03               Page 11                  20 Jan 1997


     application function.  The FOSSIL interrupt (14h) is issued with the
     following parameters:

                     AH = 7Fh        Remove appendage
                     AL = 81h        VFOSSIL application code
                     DX = offset of VFOSSIL entry point
                     ES = segment of VFOSSIL entry point

     Upon return from the FOSSIL interrupt,  the following registers are
     modified:

                     AX = 1954h      FOSSIL signature
                     BL = 81h        VFOSSIL identification code
                     BH = 01h - Removal was successful
                          00h - Removal was unsuccessful

     VFOSSIL functions called via the standard FOSSIL interrupt (14h):

     The following three functions are called via the standard FOSSIL
     interrupt, int 14h.  All other VFOSSIL functions are called via the
     OS/2 compatible direct call interface.

     Subfunction 00h - Return VFOSSIL information

             Entry:  AH = 81h        VFOSSIL application code
                     AL = 00h        VFOSSIL subfunction
                     ES:DI = Far pointer to VFOSSIL information structure

             Exit:   AX = 1954h      FOSSIL signature

         This function is used before calling the open function (sub-
     function 01h) to determine the characteristics of the VFOSSIL. Such
     things returned in the structure are current version level and number
     of functions supported.

         The format of the information structure filled in by this call is
         as follows:

             DW      Size of this structure,  in bytes,  including this
                     field
             DW      VFOSSIL major version
             DW      VFOSSIL revision level
             DW      Highest VFOSSIL application function supported

     Subfunction 01h - Open VFOSSIL

             Entry:  AH = 81h        VFOSSIL application code
                     AL = 01h        VFOSSIL subfunction
                     CX = Length of application function table (in bytes)
                     ES:DI = Far pointer to application function table

             Exit:   BH = Highest VFOSSIL application function supported
                     AX = 1954h      FOSSIL signature

             This VFOSSIL subfunction will initialize the table pointed to
     by ES:DI with far pointers to the VFOSSIL application services.
     FIDONEWS 14-03               Page 12                  20 Jan 1997


     The number of far pointers initialized is equal to the value
     returned in register BH + 1.  Under no circumstances will the number
     of far pointers initialized exceed the value passed in register
     CX / 4.  All other processing necessary to ready the VFOSSIL for use
     by the application program should be performed at this time.

     Subfunction 02h - Close VFOSSIL

             Entry:  AH = 81h        VFOSSIL application code
                     AL = 02h        VFOSSIL subfunction

             Exit:   AX = 1954h      FOSSIL signature

             This VFOSSIL function terminates all VFOSSIL operations,  and
     leaves the VFOSSIL in a state that allows for it to be removed from
     memory, or to be reinitialized via VFOSSIL function 01h.

     VFOSSIL application services:

     All calls to VFOSSIL services are made in a manner identical to the
     OS/2 API protocol.  All services are entered via a far call,  with
     parameters passed via the stack.  All services return an error code in
     register AX.  The parameters are pushed onto the stack Pascal-style,
     from left to right.  The parameters are passed on the stack in one of
     the three following ways:

         WORD   A one-word value pushed directly onto the stack

         DWRD   A double-word value pushed directly onto the stack
                (low word first,  followed by the high word)

         PTR    A far pointer to a memory area.  Far pointers are passed
                as double-word values,  segment followed by offset.

     Single-word and double-word input parameters are always passed as WORD
     and DWRD.  If the service returns information in the parameter field
     itself, then it is pushed as a PTR,  even if the object is a WORD or a
     DWRD.  Variable length parameters,  such as data structures or ASCIIZ
     strings, are always passed as PTR objects.

     All cursor coordinates are expressed as zero (0) based numbers.

     Each VFOSSIL service requires a "handle" parameter as the last
     parameter passed to the service.  At this time,  zero (0) is the only
     valid handle.

     The actual addresses used to call the application services are
     contained in the address table filled in by the VFOSSIL initialization
     call described above.  All addresses are in far (segment/offset)
     format.  Here is the format of the application service address table:

     VioWriteTTY - Write data in TTY mode

     Parameters:

             WORD    Pointer to a character string that VFOSSIL will write
                     to the screen
             WORD    String length
             WORD    VIO handle (must be 0)


     This service writes a string to the video screen in TTY mode.  The
     characters CR,  LF,  BS,  TAB,  and BELL are interpreted as control
     values rather than being display as values.  If ANSI mode has been
     enabled (see VioGetANSI, VioSetANSI),  then ANSI control sequences are
     also interpreted as control strings.  In ANSI mode,  this service is
     not required to be reentrant,  and should not be called when a MS/DOS
     function is in progress.  When in non-ANSI mode,  this service is
     required to be reentrant,  and may be called from within a MS/DOS
     function.  If the write goes beyond the end of a line, it continues at
     the start of the next line.  The write terminates at the end of the
     screen.  The cursor is left positioned at the next character position
     to be written.

     Subj: Bundle name format

     I thought I'd bring back something we discussed a few months ago for
     your enjoyment. I am doing a router and thought I might try to add
     this capability as an option.

     As you can see, this is already part of a .H file. The router will
     only build this type of bundle if specifically told to do so.
     Otherwise, it will build a standard Opus style bundle. It will be able
     to process a mix of both types.

     Oh yeah, the router will also "peek" at the Inbound area for any
     PassThru bundles. The router is specifically designed to work with
     Binkley as the mailer. There is no nonsense about delta addresses and
     such. The name of the bundle is the address of where it has to go. If
     this is not the current system then the router will tell Binkley to
     send it.

     If there exists a bundle of the same name and sequence number on the
     target machine then Binkley will automatically increment the sequence
     number.  This is a current feature of Binkley.

     Notice the special Flags for Files and EchoMail. The router will allow

     routing for both, if desired. There is also full Zone and Point
     support, something which oMMM is desparately lacking.

     There are three major routing goals:

     The router will only generate this type of bundle if it is told that a
     particular target Node can accept it. If it receives this type of
     bundle, and the router has not been told that the Node it is sending
     to can process it, than the router will transform the bundle into the
     current style of bundle acceptable by Opus. This means more
     processing, but, should allow for a smoother transition.

     Subj: Last of Good Times

     Hello, Chris!

     I saw this last night in the VIRUS echo.  In the spirit of technical
     cooperation so common to Fidonet, I thought I'd forward it to you for
     inclusion in the next Fidonews.  It contains the latest information on
     that scourge of the e-mail system, the "Good Times" virus.  The
     latest research, quoted below, demonstrates that this virus is FAR
     MORE dangerous then people had been led to believe!

     Hi Guys,

     I know that this isn't a humor conf and neither do I think viruses are
     funny, but after a spate of Good Times Virus Warnings I thought I
     might share this with you. No hate mail pleez - Just enjoy.

        "Goodtimes will re-write your hard drive. Not only that, but
     it will scramble any disks that are even close to your computer. It
     will recalibrate your refrigerator's coolness setting so all your
     ice cream goes melty. It will demagnetize the strips on all your
     credit cards, screw up the tracking on your television and use
     subspace field harmonics to scratch any CD's you try to play.

         It will give your ex-girlfriend your new phone number. It will mix
     Kool-aid into your fishtank. It will drink all your beer and leave its
     socks out on the coffee table when there's company coming over. It
     will put a dead kitten in the back pocket of your good suit pants and
     hide your car keys when you are late for work.

         Goodtimes will make you fall in love with a penguin. It will give
     you nightmares about circus midgets. It will pour sugar in your gas
     tank and shave off both your eyebrows while dating your girlfriend
     behind your back and billing the dinner and hotel room to your
     Discover card..

         It will seduce your grandmother. It does not matter if she is
     dead, such is the power of Goodtimes, it reaches out beyond the grave
     to sully those things we hold most dear.

         It moves your car randomly around parking lots so you can't find
     it. It will kick your dog. It will leave libidinous messages on your
     boss's voice mail in your voice! It is insidious and subtle. It is
     dangerous and terrifying to behold. It is also a rather interesting
     shade of mauve.

         Goodtimes will give you Dutch Elm disease. It will leave the
     toilet seat up. It will make a batch of Methamphetamine in your
     bathtub and then leave bacon cooking on the stove while it goes out to
     chase gradeschoolers with your new snowblower.

         Listen to me. Goodtimes does not exist.

         It cannot do anything to you. But I can. I am sending this message
     to everyone in the world. Tell your friends, tell your family. If
     anyone else sends me another E-mail about this fake Goodtimes Virus,
     I will turn hating them into a religion. I will do things to them that
     would make a horsehead in your bed look like Easter Sunday brunch.

     Do you think you can give us all in Z1 a "State of the Zone " message.

     At least let us know what you intend to do in the next year concerning
     the coordination of Zone 1.

     Thanks Bob

     WHAT TO DO...

      ...if you get a phone call from Mars.

         Speak slowly and be sure to enunciate your words properly.  Limit
         your vocabulary to simple words.  Try to determine if you are
         speaking to someone in a leadership capacity, or an ordinary
         citizen.

     ...if he or she doesn't speak English?

         Hang up.  There's no sense in trying to learn Martian over the
         phone.  If your Martian really had something important to say to
         you, he or she would have taken the trouble to learn the language
         before calling.

     ...if you get a phone call from Jupiter?

         Explain to your caller, politely but firmly, that being from
         Jupiter, he or she is not `life as we know it'.  Try to terminate
         the conversation as soon as possible.  It will not profit you.

     ...if a starship, equipped with an FTL hyperdrive, lands in your
         backyard?

         First of all, do not run after your camera.  You will not have
         any film.  Be polite.  Remember, if they have an FTL hyperdrive,
         they can probably vaporize you, should they find you to be rude.
         Direct them to the White House lawn, which is where they probably
         wanted to land, anyway.  A good road map should help.

     ...if you wake up in the middle of the night, and discover that your
         closet contains an alternate dimension?

         Don't go in.  You almost certainly will not be able to get back,
         and alternate dimensions are almost never any fun. Remain calm
         and go back to bed.  Check your closet in the morning.  If it
         still contains an alternate dimension, nail it shut.

     ...if reality disappears?

         Hope this one doesn't happen to you.  There is not much you can
         do about it.  It can be quite unpleasant.

     ...if you meet an older version of yourself who has invented a time
         traveling machine, and has come from the future to meet you?

         Follow the books on this one.  Ask about the stock market and
         cash in.  Don't forget to invent a time traveling machine and
         visit your younger self before you die, or you will create a
         paradox.

     Rights On!, 1:18/14
     Edgewater_FL_USA

     Wanted: old electronics parts.

     I'm looking for control panels from old 2" video tape mastering
     equipment. They don't have to be working as long as they are intact
     externally with knobs and VUs in place. These panels are about 3.5
     feet long and six inches top to bottom.

     I'm also looking for old Commodore 64 keyboards. They don't need to
     be operational either.

     I would prefer them to be free but reasonable costs are acceptable.

     If you have or know where such items may be obtained, please send
     Netmail to the address above or email to me at:

       cbaker84@digital.net

     with details.

     Thanks.

     QOFM.
     Chris

     Latest Greatest Software Versions
     by Peter E. Popovich, 1:363/264

     The backlog is actually getting winnowed down to something
     manageable. I guess I'm actually starting to get caught up... ;-)

     I added my first Atari entry this week and have a couple of others
     pending. I also finally got enough info about GoldED to get it added.

     Given that my "todo" queue is almost empty, I'm going to encourage
     everyone to check to make sure every package they use is listed and
     for each package that isn't listed, netmail me with the names of the
     package and contact info for the author or a support site. I actually
     got caught up enough to twiddle my thumbs, so I think I can handle
     a few extra suggestions... ;-)

     Also, since I've fallen way behind my original estimates for phasing
     out the old info section, I've reformatted it a little to reduce the
     space it takes.

     Phased out this week: SuperComm 0.99 and TAG 2.5g

     Phase-out highlights:
       This week: Telegard 2.7 and TPBoard 6.1
             Deadline for info: 31 Jan 1997.
       Last week: TBBS 2.1 and TComm/TCommNet 3.4
             Deadline for info: 24 Jan 1997.
