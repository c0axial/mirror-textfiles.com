     FidoNet Policy4 is like the weather. It changes depending on where you
     are and everyone talks about it but nobody does anything about it.

     We still don't have an International Coordinator to take the reins of
     this debate and throw the darn thing out.

     Other than that, nothing else is new, either.

     Hi Chris,

     For the first time in my life, I'd like to submit something to
     Fidonews please!  :-)

                               --/// Snip ///--

     Hi Folks!,

     FOTI (Fidonet On The Internet) is a new project being coordinated by a
     number of people in the UK with an interest in the future of Fidonet,
     and we're looking for help from any Fidonet echo moderators and
     Fidonet shareware authors around the world.

     FOTI includes sections about Fido-related shareware/freeware programs,
     and echomail conferences available around the world - there is even an
     opportunity for each program or echo to have it's own mini web-site,
     if it doesn't already have one elsewhere :-)

     Initially, it would be great if any author or moderator with WWW
     access could pop onto the site at http://www.trak-one.co.uk/foti, and
     take a look at the format of the information we're already carrying.
     Then, put together some information that you'd like shown (if it's
     already in HTML, then great), and send it to us so that we can include
     it.

     Once you have something to send, please use one of the following
     methods to submit your info:

     * Upload it to ftp://ftp.trak-one.co.uk/incoming (active from Friday
     28th November), and send an e-mail to input@foti.trak-one.co.uk
     telling us it's there (Please give the filename and program/echo-tag
     it refers to).

     * File attach it to an e-mail to input@foti.trak-one.co.uk or netmail
     to me at 2:25/999 or 2:254/60.

     This part of the FOTI project relies on YOU make it a success!

     The site will be updated each Saturday with submissions received
     during the previous week .... Please help - Don't miss out! :-)

     Join us every Saturday at 11 am on the site for live chat about the
     future of Fidonet!

      Cheers,
     FIDONEWS 14-48               Page 3                    1 Dec 1997

     FidoNet dies a slow death!
     by: Bobby Queen 1:3667/5 changes to 1:18/178 on 11/28/97

     Well to show how bad FidoNet is hurting our local Net 3667 is being
     dissolved this week due to the NC/NEC and 3 more BBS's quitting all at
     once.

     This means my node number is being changed to a regional independent
     due to the fact that the next closest net is still LD to me.

     I am going to do my best in the limited time my RC Ken Tuley is giving
     me to try to get enough BBS's here in town hooked up so we can
     resurrect Net 3667 again out of the ashes.

     I think the reason Net 3667 never took off was the NC/NEC was charging
     an outrageous amount of CRP.  That is one of the main problems that is
     still hiding in FidoNet today.

     As the Internet becomes more popular it is hurting us BBS's but it is
     also making it easier for us to get our FidoNet mail and files via FTP
     and other Internet means.  So lets each one contact a few local boards
     this next week that are not in FidoNet and see if we can not reverse
     this backwards slide that FidoNet is in.

     1. Introduction
     ---------------
        This document informs about known differences of FidoNet zone 2
        nodelist flags from FTS-0005.003.  The ultimate sources for these
        informations are the current Z2 nodelist epilogue and the setup
        for flag corrections at Z2C, but it may be difficult to get these
        sources for readers in other zones.

     |  All changes since version 5 are marked by a bar at the left edge.
        It is (again) possible to list V32b and V42b in zone 2, upper case
        V32B or V42B is not more enforced.  Currently new flags needed for
        IP-connectivity are under test in zone 2 (only internally), e.g.

        ->   VM      VModem, default port  3141, dummy country code 000-
        ->   IFC     IFCico, default port 60179, dummy country code 000-
        ->   BND     BinkP,  default port 24544, dummy country code 000-
        ->   IP      general IP connectivity,    dummy country code 000-
        ->   TELN    Telnet                      dummy country code 000-


     2. FTS-0005 flags
     -----------------
        The following flags are used as specified in FTS-0005.003:

             CM      Continuous Mail, node accepts mail 24 hours a day
             MO      Mailer Only (no BBS)
             LO      Listed Only, node accepts calls only from listed
                     node numbers in the current FidoNet nodelist

        ->   V21     ITU-T V21      300 bps full duplex (obsolete)
             V22     ITU-T V22     1200 bps full duplex (obsolescent)

     |  In zone 2 the value 1200 in the baud rate field implies V22.  Only
     |  two nodes not supporting at least V22bis, ISDN, or IP still exist
     |  in the zone 2 segment.  Flag V22 is almost obsolete, and V21 is
     |  already removed in Z2.  Both flags should be dropped from the next
     |  FTS-0005 version.

             V29     ITU-T V29     9600 bps half duplex (obsolescent)
        ->   V33     ITU-T V33    14400 bps half duplex (obsolete)

        V33 cannot be used in connecting FidoNet nodes over public dial-up
        lines and is most probably a historical error in FTS-0005.  A very
        similar argument is applicable on V29, all nodes flying this flag
        support at least V32.  Today only one node in Z2 still flies V29,
        and V33 is already removed in Z2.  Both flags should be dropped in
     FIDONEWS 14-48               Page 5                    1 Dec 1997


        the next FTS-0005 version.

             V32     ITU-T V32     9600 bps full duplex
             V32b    ITU-T V32bis 14400 bps full duplex (implies V32)
     |       V34     ITU-T V34    28800 bps full duplex (33600 bps option)

        FTS-0005 specifies V32b and V42b (capital V and small b), current
        nodelist practice in FidoNet shows all combinations of small and
        capital letters for flags.  This was no problem before FSC-0062
        introduced case-sensitive flags.  The best solution is to stick to
        the current practice and treat all old flags as case-insensitive.

             H96     Hayes V9600
             HST     USR Courier HST up to 9600  (implies MNP)
             H14     USR Courier HST up to 14400 (implies HST)
        ->   H16     USR Courier HST up to 16800 (implies H14 and V42b)
             MAX     Microcom AX/96xx series (almost obsolete)
             PEP     Packet Ensemble Protocol
             CSP     Compucom Speedmodem
        ->   ZYX     Zyxel series 16800 bps (implies V32b and V42b)
        ->   V32T    V.32 Terbo   19200 bps (implies V32b)
             VFC     V.Fast Class 28800 bps (should imply V32b and V42b)

        If a flag directly or indirectly implies other flags, then these
        other flags are not shown in a nodelist entry, because this would
        be redundant.  Unfortunately the rules for redundancies in zone 2
        and FTS-0005 are different.  Zone 2 continued to avoid redundancy
        with most "new" flags, but FTS-0005.003 specified no redundancies
        for "new" flags like ZYX, H16, V32T, or VFC.  "New" flags in this
        context are flags approved by FidoNet International Coordinators
        since 1989, when FTS-0005.TXT, the predecesssor of FTS-0005.003,
        was published.

        For details see the chapter "implications" below, for now only
        note, that in zone 2 H16 implies V42b, ZYX implies V32b and V42b,
        and V32T implies V32b.

        Zone 1 and zone 2 have introduced a user flag Z19 approved by the
        corresponding Zone Coordinator.  User flags are discussed later,
        for now only note, that in zone 2 ZYX is specified as Zyxel 16k8,
        while FTS-0005.003 not knowing Z19 specifies ZYX as generic flag
        for all Zyxel protocol speeds.

        Today only one node in FidoNet still really flies MAX, this flag
        is obsolete and should be dropped from FTS-0005.  The flags CSP
        (7 nodes worldwide) and H96 should be marked as obsolescent.

     |       MNP     Microcom Networking Protocol 2-4 error correction
     |       V42     ITU-T LAP-M error correction w/ fallback to MNP 2-4
     |       V42b    ITU-T V.42bis BTLZ data compression over V.42 LAP-M

        The next version of FTS-0005 should adopt the better V42b and
        MNP definitions of the zone 3 nodelist epilogue.  FTS-0005.003
        specifies an implication of V42 by V42b, but the exact meaning of
        the flag MNP is unclear.  Most probably this flag was meant to
     |  indicate support of MNP 2-4, and in this sense V42 implies MNP.
     FIDONEWS 14-48               Page 6                    1 Dec 1997


     |  Note the difference between the flag V42b (implying V42) and the
     |  standard V.42bis (not necessarily based on LAP-M as data link
     |  layer protocol), without this difference the flag V42b would be
     |  ambiguous for combined modem and ISDN node entries.

             MN      No compression supported in insecure inbound

             XA      Bark and WaZOO file/update requests
             XB      Bark file/update requests, WaZOO file requests
             XC      Bark file requests, WaZOO file/update requests
             XP      Bark file/update requests
             XR      Bark and WaZOO file requests
             XW      WaZOO file requests
             XX      WaZOO file/update requests

        These flags are equivalent in FTS-0005 and in the zone 2 segment.

             Gx..x   Gateway to domain 'x..x'

        Valid values for this flag are assigned by the Fido International
        Coordinator, FTS-0005.003 explicitly mentions GUUCP.  In zone 2
        only GUUCP gateways are flagged.

             #01     Zone 5 mail hour (01:00 - 02:00 UTC) w/ Bell 212A
             #02     Zone 2 mail hour (02:30 - 03:30 UTC) w/ Bell 212A
        ->   #08     Zone 4 mail hour (08:00 - 09:00 UTC) w/ Bell 212A
             #09     Zone 1 mail hour (09:00 - 10:00 UTC) w/ Bell 212A
             #18     Zone 3 mail hour (18:00 - 19:00 UTC) w/ Bell 212A
             #20     Zone 6 mail hour (20:00 - 21:00 UTC) w/ Bell 212A

        The variants !01, !02, !08, !09, !18, and !20 indicate missing
        Bell 212A support.  In zone 2 #02 or !02 would be obviously
        redundant.

        Today less than four 1200 modems (V22 or Bell 212A) are listed.
        A future version of FTS-0005 should drop !mn variants together
        with V21 and V22 flags.

        Further most non-CM systems flagging #mn or !mn today probably
        want to show additional online times instead of additional mail
        hours.  As soon as FSC-0062 flags have been approved by the IC
        or adopted as FTS by the FTSC, the following version of FTS-0005
        should mark #mn as obsolescent and recommend the more flexible
        FSC-0062 flags (see below).


     3. User flags
     -------------
        An example for one of several problems in zone 2 with user flags:

             ...,U,Z19,V110H,V120L,V120H,X75,ENC,NEC

        These flags indicate a modern Zyxel ISDN-modem and two additional
        user flags ENC and NEC.  This possible user flags string contains
        34 characters, but at most 32 characters are allowed in FTS-0005.

     FIDONEWS 14-48               Page 7                    1 Dec 1997


             ...,U,Z19,V110L,V110H,X75,ISDNA,ISDNB,ISDNC

        During the period for the replacement of old by new ISDN flags
        (several months !) many nodes listed both old and new flags for
        maximal compatibility, and no problems with nodelist compilers
        or mailers caused by too long user flags strings were reported.

        Therefore the length limit in FTS-0005 is probably unnecessary
        and at least inconsequent:  Other nodelist fields like the system
        name are unlimited, so why only restrict the user flags string ?
        To help developpers an upper limit of e.g. 255 characters for a
        nodelist line and 63 characters for fields 3 to 6 would be more
        useful.

        The next problem with user flag strings as specified in FTS-0005
        is their introduction by the letter U with no comma following:

        Nodelist compilers could parse ...,UISDN,USR in user flags ISDN
        and USR.  But USR cannot be approved as "real" flag, because the
        combination ...,USR,UISDN would then be parsed in SR and UISDN.

        Other side effects of the FTS-0005 specification are additional
        difficulties in finding flags.  Almost all flags are separated
        by a comma, only the first user flag can be an exception to this
        simple rule.  If the order of user flags has no meaning, then...

             ...,UV120L,V120H
             ...,UV120H,V120L

        ... are equivalent.  A "simple" solution of this problem could be
        to treat UV120L as synonym for V120L, and UV120H as synonym for
        V120H.  Similar problems show up, if user flags are counted, etc.

        Obviously a nodelist compiler looking for user flags has always
        to consider the case "user flag separated by comma".  In zone 2
        this idea was simply extended to the first user flag:

        All flags are separated by commas.  Flags not yet approved by the
        International Coordinator or the FTSC (i.e. user flags only used
        experimentally or locally) are separated by a new pseudo flag U.

        ->   U       pseudo flag to the left of at least one user flag

        All flags following this pseudo flag U are user flags, all flags
        before this pseudo flag are "real" flags specified in FTS-0005 or
        approved by the International Coordinator.

        Because this definition should be compatible with any reasonable
        software implementation based on FTS-0005.003, and simplifies the
        handling of user flags significantly, a future FTS-0005 version
        will hopefully adopt it.


     4. Approved zone 2 user flags
     -----------------------------
        In zone 2 user flags have to be approved by the Zone Coordinator.
     FIDONEWS 14-48               Page 8                    1 Dec 1997


        Currently the following zone 2 user flags exist:

        ->   V110L   ITU-T V.110 19k2 async 'Low'    (former ISDNA)
        ->   V110H   ITU-T V.110 38k4 async 'High'   (former ISDNB)
        ->   V120L   ITU-T V.120 56k6 async, N1 = 259, W = 7, modulo 8
        ->   V120H   ITU-T V.120 64k  async, N1 = 259, W = 7, modulo 8
        ->   X75     ITU-T X.75 SLP (single link procedure),
                     64kbit/s B channel; layer 2 max. framesize N1 = 2048,
                     window size W = 2, frame numbering modulo 8;
                     layer 3 transparent (no packet layer)
        ->   ISDN    Other configuration, used only if none of above fits

        These ISDN flags follow the specification in FSC-0091.

        ->   Tyz     Online time flags as specified in FSC-0062

        The flag Tyz is used by non-CM nodes online not only during ZMH,
        y is a letter indicating the start and z a letter indicating the
        end of the online period as defined below (times in UTC):

             A  0:00,  a  0:30,   B  1:00,  b  1:30,   C  2:00,  c  2:30,
             D  3:00,  d  3:30,   E  4:00,  e  4:30,   F  5:00,  f  5:30,
             G  6:00,  g  6:30,   H  7:00,  h  7:30,   I  8:00,  i  8:30,
             J  9:00,  j  9:30,   K 10:00,  k 10:30,   L 11:00,  l 11:30,
             M 12:00,  m 12:30,   N 13:00,  n 13:30,   O 14:00,  o 14:30,
             P 15:00,  p 15:30,   Q 16:00,  q 16:30,   R 17:00,  r 17:30,
             S 18:00,  s 18:30,   T 19:00,  t 19:30,   U 20:00,  u 20:30,
             V 21:00,  v 21:30,   W 20:00,  w 20:30,   X 23:00,  x 23:30.

        For example TuB shows an online period from 20:30 until 1:00 UTC.

        ->   Z19     Zyxel series 19200 bps (implies ZYX)
        ->   X2C     x2 client w/ 56000 bps (should imply V34 and V42b)
        ->   X2S     x2 server w/ 64000 bps (should imply V34 and V42b)

        ->   K12     Systems offering all educational K12-conferences
        ->   ENC     The node accepts inbound encrypted mail

        ->   NC      Network Coordinator (only if the NC is not the host)
        ->   NEC     Net Echomail Coordinator    (at most one per net)
        ->   REC     Region Echomail Coordinator (at most one per region)

        Redundant AKAs used to indicate echomail coordination in zone 2
        are no longer permitted.  One *EC flag is valid for all AKAs of
        a given sysop.


     5. Flag implications
     --------------------
        Flag implications directly or indirectly specified in FTS-0005:

             HST     => MNP
             H14     => MNP HST
             H16     => MNP HST H14
             V42b    => V42 (MNP ?)
             V32b    => V32
     FIDONEWS 14-48               Page 9                    1 Dec 1997


        Flag implications specified in the zone 2 nodelist epilogue:

             HST     => MNP
             H14     => HST MNP
        ->   H16     => V42 MNP V42b H14 HST
        ->   V42b    => V42 MNP
        ->   ZYX     => V42 MNP V42b V32 V32b
        ->   Z19     => V42 MNP V42b V32 V32b ZYX
             V32b    => V32
        ->   V32T    => V32 V32b

        ->   V110L   => ISDN
        ->   V110H   => ISDN
        ->   V120L   => ISDN
        ->   V120H   => ISDN
        ->   X75     => ISDN

        The latter ISDN flag redundancies are a consequence of FSC-0091.
        Maybe some of the following implications could be added in zone 2:

             VFC     => V32 V32b MNP V42 V42b
             X2C     => V34 MNP V42 V42b
             X2S     => V34 MNP V42 V42b

        Flag implications (i.e. not listing redundant flags) have several
        advantages:  Some old nodelist tools are unable to handle too long
        lines.  Old flags like HST, MNP, V42, or V32 vanish automatically,
        if they are implied by H16, V42b, V32b, or better.  Redundancies
        defined globally for the whole nodelist help to avoid flag errors.


     6. Invalid combinations
     -----------------------
        All file request flags exclude each other (at most 1 is possible):
        XA, XB, XC, XP, XR, XW, and XX.  For flag checkers only supporting
        implications a good approximation based on FTS-0005 definitions is

     |       XA      => XW XR XP XB XC XX,
     |       XB      => XW XR XP,
     |       XC      => XW XR XX,
     |       XR      => XW,
     |       XX      => XW.

        Further X2C cannot be combined with X2S, and FSC-62 Tyz-flags are
        not possible with CM.  Also Tyz with y = z is of course incorrect.

        Some modem protocols are "proprietary" in a sense, that all today
        known modems can fly at most one of the corresponding modem flags:
        MAX, CSP, H96, PEP, HST, H14, H16, ZYX, and Z19.

        A few "old" modem protocol flags are known to be invalid if used
        together with "new" protocol flags, i.e. each "old" flag excludes
        all "new" flags and vice versa:

        "Old" in this sense are MAX, CSP, H96, HST, H14, V32, and PEP.
        "New" in this sense are X2S, X2C, V34, VFC, V32T, and H16.
     FIDONEWS 14-48               Page 10                   1 Dec 1997


        For Z2 add ZYX as "old" and Z19 as "new".  A simple REXX script to
        test some known inconsistencies is available as NLSCHECK.REX at
        the site of the author.  While erroneously listing redundant flags
        causes no harm, other errors like combining V34 with HST or Z19
        with H16 indicate serious problems, which can result in connection
        failures or other damage.


     7. Baud rate field
     ------------------
        The baud rate field 7 in the nodelist as specified in FTS-0005 is
        nearly useless today:  Except from a few remaining 1200 and 2400
        nodes almost all nodelist entries show either 9600 for all modem
        protocols better than V22bis or 300 for ISDN (or IP) only nodes.
        No more V21 or Bell 103 modems are listed for more than 2 years.

        The baud rate values 19200 and 38400 specified in FTS-0005.003
        have not been used in the FidoNet nodelist.  So all a reasonable
        nodelist compiler can do today, is treat 300 as indicator for
        ISDN or IP only, and treat unknown or missing values in field 7
        like 9600.

        A new meaning for field 7 as speed field could be really useful.
        An example is ZYX, if we would have 16800, 19200, 28800, and 33600
        as speed values, then their combination with ZYX is all we need
        technically, Z19 would be unnecessary.  Another example is HST,
        flags H14 and H16 are unnecessary, if HST is combined with 9600,
        14400, 16800, 28800, or better.  Variants of PEP could be shown in
        the speed field without new flags.  "Enhanced V32.terbo" could be
        shown by 21600.

        Most important:  V34 may have the famous bug not allowing connects
        from new "V34+", unless the caller disabled symbol rate 3429.  If
        "V34+" is indicated by speed 33600 or better, then an appropriate
        setup for all kinds of V34 connects is possible.

        A future version of FTS-0005 hopefully allows the following speed
        values in field 7:

               300   reserved for ISDN or IP only (for historical reasons)
              1200   obsolete (either V.22 in Z2 / Z3, or Bell 212A in Z1)
              2400   implies V22bis, qualifies as least common denominator
              9600   default, used with PEP, V32, HST, H96, (CSP), (MAX)
             12000   rare variant of V32
             14400   used with V32b or HST (obsoleting H14)
             16800   used with ZYX  or HST (obsoleting H16)
             19200   used with V32T or ZYX (obsoleting Z19)
             21600   rare variant of V32T (no "H21" needed)
             28800   used with VFC or V34
             33600   used with V34 (no V34+ or V34b needed)
     |       56000   used with X2C, X2S, or V.PCM

        Allowing more than 12 speed values or allowing speed values above
        64000 could break existing software (MakeNL, V7).  Therefore the
        next step in FidoNet could be, to add 12000, 14400, 16800, 19200,
        21600, 28800, 33600, and 56000, where 19200 is already specified

     And can I ask you why it matters? This sort of geographical nonsense
     is damaging to Fidonet - it merely gives some "power hungry fiends"
     something to worry about. Do a bit of research and find out about
     Fidonet in Asia and you might see why a node would want to be in zones
     1 or 2...

     A man was walking along the beach and found a bottle.  He looked

     Airplanes are too frightening for me.  On a boat, I see all that water
     and I become very claustrophobic.  So I wish for a road to be built
     from here to Hawaii.  The genie thought for a few minutes and finally
     said, "No, I don't think I can do that.  Just think of all the work
     involved.  Consider all the pilings needed to hold up a highway and
     how deep they would have to go to reach the bottom of the ocean.
     Imagine all the pavement needed.  No, that is just too much to ask."

     The man thought for a few minutes and then told the genie, "There is
     one other thing I have always wanted.  I would like to be able to
     understand programmers.  What makes them laugh and cry, why are they
     temperamental, why are they so difficult to get along with.
     Basically, what makes them tick."

     The genie considered for a few minutes and said, "So, do you want two
     lanes or four?"

     Hello All Sysops & Co_Sysops:

     What is the biggest problem on fidonet these days?  Most users are
     leaving fidonet and going on the internet.  Well if you want to get
     more users on your BBS I suggest you request the WRESTLING_CHAT  on
     your BBS.

     The WRESTLING_CHAT provide all the latest news, rumors, Scoops and
     Upcoming events in the Wrestling world.  Plus the users can enjoy
     chatting about the sport with other great wrestling fans.  The
     WRESTLING_CHAT provide a great atmosphere for the users on your BBS.

     If you need additional information please contact me either on my
     fidonet or internet address.

     Thank you

     Emanuel  Fidonet 1:348/963
                        Internet  emanuel@pangea.ca
