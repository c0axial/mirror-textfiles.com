               Managing a Major Network Reorganisation

     One of the most frustrating things about being involved in a
     "remote" Fido network is finding out how other nets have solved
     problems in the past.  Somehow or other we manage to struggle
     along here on the bottom of the world, often I fear re-inventing
     the Fido wheel.  Occasionally we come across something that
     another net has taken the trouble to document, such as the SOCAL
     echomail policy document ECHO-102.  Even though this document
     was way out of date when I got it, it shed light into several
     dim areas of echomail and gave us some idea of what should be done.

     In this light I am submitting the documentation on the Great
     Australian Network Changeover to FidoNews, in the knowlege that
     someone else in the Fido community, either now or sometime in
     the future is sure to need to do the same sort of thing again.

     I'd also like to say thank you VERY much to Jon Sabol, 1/112, who
     turned a spoltlight into many dark recesses of echomail for me.

                                                   Bill Bolton
                    PREPARING YOUR SYSTEM FOR THE
                       GREAT AUSNET CHANGEOVER
                    -----------------------------
                          By  Gary Stern
                          and Bill Bolton

     Network 155 in Region 12 will soon cease to exist and will be
     replaced by four new networks, Nets 620, 626, 630 and 690 in Region
     50.  You will need to make some changes to your system to
     accommodate the new networks.  The way we will pass mail around
     the network is also changing.  This document will tell you what
     you need to do to be ready for changeover day, December 7th.


     IF YOU ARE RUNNING FIDO ONLY
     ----------------------------

     Fido users will need these files:

          1.  XLATLIST.600 Sample control file.
          2.  ROUTEGEN.60X Sample Control files.
          3.  AUS_ECHO.ARC New echomail files.


     IF YOU ARE RUNNING FIDO + SEADOG
     --------------------------------

     Fido systems that are also running SEADOG will need an
     Fidonews                     Page 3                   29 Dec 1986


     additional file:

          4.  PARTCDOG.600 Sample sections of SEAdog files.


     WHERE TO GET THE FILES
     ----------------------

     The files probably wont be ready at the same time that this
     document gets distributed but should be ready within a day or
     two.  A message advising where to get them will follow shortly.


     READ IT ALL!
     ------------

     It doesn't matter what you are running, you should read the
     whole document before doing anything.


     BEFORE THE CHANGEOVER
     ---------------------

     On or before December 1st, 1986.

     1)   Close down the sending of echomail from your node as
          soon as you receive this document.  This is done by
          disabling all SCANMAIL invocation lines in your RUNBBS
          batch files.  Then you must edit your AREAS.BBS to remove
          all forwarding nodes. You should continue to run TOSSMAIL
          after all mail events so that any echomail still in the
          mail system that is delivered to you will be tossed to the
          correct area.

     2)   While this point is not policy, you should consider
          raising the level of access to your FidoNet MAIL area to
          sysop privilege only, until after the changeover.

          This will avoid users sending out mail to other nodes with
          "soon to be invalid" return addresses.  When we change, the
          old net numbers will disappear out of the nodelist plus your
          individual node within your new net might be different.

          Also if you have mail from your system still IN TRANSIT
          anywhere in the network (maybe overseas) when the nodelist
          with the new node numbers becomes effective, the transiting
          node will immediately ORPHAN your messages which means they
          will never be delivered.


     AT THE TIME TO CHANGEOVER
     -------------------------

     At 1200 hrs (midday) on Sunday, December 7, 1986:

     You should have received NODEDIFF.A39 in the morning mail
     Fidonews                     Page 4                   29 Dec 1986


     schedule.  In a perfect world that would be all you would
     receive, however since we haven't had to do a changeover like
     this previously you may also receive some final instructions so
     please check your mail on that day.

     1)   Check NODEDIFF.339 with an editor or just type it out, just
          to make sure the changes have been done.  You will find
          that Australia is now in Region 3 which should be well down
          toward the end of the file.  If for some reason it isn't
          there or you haven't received NODEDIFF.A39, DO NOT MAKE ANY
          FURTHER CHANGES.  Ring your Network Co-ordinator for
          information.

     2)   You will have to modify the new XLATLIST.CTL file
          distributed with this document. You need to insert your new
          Node Number.  If you have any BAUD or PHONE statements
          applying to Net 155 nodes statements in your present
          XLATLIST.CTL, these need to added and also modified to
          reflect the new network addresses.  Finally you'll need to
          modify the cost table in the new file to suit your
          location!

          If you are a hub or a host, please carefully read the
          special instructions in the XLATLIST.CTL file.

     3)   ROUTEGEN.CTL must be modified.  If you will be in Net 620
          you can use the ROUTEGEN.620 file after renaming it to
          ROUTEGEN.CTL.  If you are in Net 626 use ROUTEGEN.626,
          if in Net 630 use ROUTEGEN.630 and if in Net 690 use
          ROUTEGN.690.  You only have to insert your new NODE number.
          You should delete all existing ROUTE.* files before
          running Routegen.

     4)   Before running XLATLIST you must go into Fido and use the
          SYSOP "4" command to reset your Net and Node numbers.   You
          MUST reset your Net/Node numbers before you run XLATLIST.

          If you are also a HUB or a HOST you MUST set your Net and
          Node number in Fido to your normal node identity.  You
          should set your Alternate Node number to your hub or host
          identity.  You MUST NOT put your hub or host identity as
          your primary node number.

     5)   Run XLATLIST and invoke Fido to compile its new nodelist.

     6)   Modify your RUNBBS.BAT (or SEADOG.BAT) file to cover
          the new mail arrangements and external events as detailed
          below.

     7)   Put your system back on line.



     NEW MAIL ARRANGEMENTS
     ---------------------

     Fidonews                     Page 5                   29 Dec 1986


     Fido doesn't use daylight saving times and will not refer to
     them in this document.  If you have trouble converting between
     Australian Eastern Standard Time and daylight saving time, buy
     yourself a cheap digital watch (they just about give them away
     now) and leave it set to Australian Eastern Standard time.  You
     should then be able to get the times right!

     The Australian National Mail Hour will run from 0400 to 0500
     Australian Eastern Standard Time,  0330 to 0430 Australian
     Central Standard Time and 0200 to 0300 Australian Western
     Standard Time.


     IF YOU ARE IN NET 626, 630 or 690
     ---------------------------------

     Nets 626, 630 and 690 will send mail to their hosts for 25
     minutes, starting 30 minutes before the national mail hour using
     Schedule-G. Starting 5 minutes after the national mail hour,
     nodes will poll their host to pickup mail for 25 minutes using
     Schedule-W.


     IF YOU ARE IN NET 620 AND ARE A LOCAL NODE
     ------------------------------------------

     Net 620 is more complicated as it running three hubs.  The local
     nodes will send mail to their hubs for 10 minutes using
     Schedule-H, starting 30 minutes before the national mail hour
     and ending 20 minutes before the national mail hour.  The local
     nodes will send any mail not addressed to the nodes on their
     hub, and which was not able to be delivered to their hub
     (perhaps due to a failure), to the outgate for 10 minutes using
     Schedule-G, starting 15 minutes before the national mail hour
     and ending 5 minutes before the national mail hour.

     After the national mail hour the local nodes will be in a
     receive only mode for 20 minutes using Schedule-V. This is
     followed by 10 minutes where the local nodes poll their hub for
     received mail using Schedule-W.


     IF YOU ARE IN NET 620 AND ARE A HUB
     -----------------------------------

     The Hubs will receive mail from their local nodes for 10 minutes
     using Schedule-H, starting 30 minutes before the national mail
     hour and ending 20 minutes before the national mail hour.  This
     is followed by 5 minutes to process the received mail.  Hubs
     will then send any network mail to the outgate for 10 minutes
     using Schedule-G, starting 15 minutes before the national mail
     hour and ending 5 minutes before the national mail hour.

     The hubs will receive mail from the outgate for 10 minutes using
     Schedule-V, starting 5 minutes after the national mail hour and
     ending 15 minutes after the national mail hour.  This is
     Fidonews                     Page 6                   29 Dec 1986


     followed by a 5 minutes to process the received mail.  For 10
     minutes, commencing 20 minutes after the national mail hour, the
     hub is polled by its local nodes to pickup received mail, using
     Schedule-W.

     The 5 minutes between the schedules before and after the national
     mail hour are for the hubs to run arcmail (from), tossmail,
     scanmail and arcmail (to).


     MAIL TIMETABLE FOR HUBBED NETWORK
     ---------------------------------

     The following timetable shows what each stage in a three
     tiered mail network (node, hub, outgate) in region 50 does
     during national mail processing.

     MAIL TIMETABLE FOR HOST NETWORK
     -------------------------------

     The following timetable shows what each stage in a two tiered
     mail network (node, host) in Region 50 does during national mail
     processing.

     Time          Node            Host

     ECHOMAIL
     --------

     All echomail will be shut down prior to the changeover.  New
     software will be distributed to all nodes and echomail
     conferences will be reintroduced, one at a time.

     To speed mail processing, ARCMAIL is being introduced.  ARCMAIL
     has a dramatic effect on the handling of all mail, but
     especially echomail and will allow us to expand the number of
     echomail conferences that can be supported by the network.

     Nodes will run an external event commencing an adequate time
     prior to their first morning mail period, we recommend at least
     5 minutes before the mail period.  This event will include
     TOSSMAIL to clear any mail echomail left in the net mail message
     area for the previous mail time, SCANMAIL to place new echomail
     messages from the node into the net mail area and ARCMAIL to
     pack the messages for sending.
     Fidonews                     Page 8                   29 Dec 1986


     Similarly, an adequate time after the morning mail period, nodes
     will run another external event, again we recommend 5 minutes
     after the end of the mail period to ensure any mail
     transmissions have finished.  This event will run ARCMAIL to
     unpack messages and TOSSMAIL to clear echomail messages from the
     net mail areas into the appropriate conference areas.  You may
     optionally want to renumber or otherwise process received
     messages at this stage.


     ECHOMAIL CONFERENCES
     --------------------

     The first echomail conference that will be started is a new one
     for the Australian FidoNet Association.  This will be followed
     by AUST_SYSOP etc. at a later date.  You will be advised when
     other conferences will individually commence.

     The reason for re-starting echomail with a new conference is to
     simplify the initial testing of the new echomail routing
     structure.  When the existing conferences are re-started you
     will need to do a lot of work with the SEENBY and SETMARKS
     commands to prepare your echomail areas.  Instructions on what to
     do will be issued separately once we have the AFNA conference
     running satisfactorily.

     Please note that you must use the new echomail files contained
     in AUS_ECHO.ARC.  The other conferences will not be restarted
     until everyone is using the same versions of echomail software.

     You will need to create a system message area for the AFNA
     conference and then edit AREAS.BBS to enter the AFNA message
     area number and the conference name AUST_FNA.


     ECHOMAIL HANDLING
     -----------------

     Local nodes will only forward echomail to their hubs or hosts.
     Hubs or hosts will only forward echomail to their local nodes
     plus the outgate.

     The following are examples of entries in the AREAS.BBS files for
     various nodes:

          HUB 500
          -------

          20 AUST_FNA 620/200 620/502 620/503 620/504 620/505

          This hub has the AFNA conference is message area 20 and
          forwards it to his local nodes 620/502....620/505 and
          to the outgate 620/200

          10 AUST_FNA 620/500

          This node has the AFNA conference in message area 10
          and forwards it to his hub, 620/500 only.

     Hubs will still receive messages intended for them as nodes
     because echomail knows about alternate node numbers. That's why
     its important that your hub or host number be the alternate node
     identity and not the primary one.

     Using the same examples here are the sort of command lines which
     should appear in your RUNBBS batch files:-


          HUB 500 before Schedule-G and after Schedule-V
          ----------------------------------------------

          arcmail from 620/200 620/502 620/503 620/504 620/505
          tossmail run -stats
          scanmail run -nopriv -stats
          arcmail to 620/200 620/502 620/503 620/504 620/505

          The hub runs the same event for all mail processing.

          Before Schedule-G the hub unARCs mail received from its
          local nodes and tosses any echomail into the appropriate
          areas.  It then scans echomail areas for outbound messages,
          including any echomail messages originating from the hub.
          It then ARCs all mail destined for the outgate and nodes.
          Any messages originating on the hub and destined for the
          local nodes are ARCed but will remain in the net mail
          message area for the time being.

          After Schedule-V the hub unARCs any mail received from the
          outgate and tosses any echomail into the appropriate areas.
          It then scans echomail areas for outbound messages and
          places them in the network file area.  Any messages for the
          local nodes are then ARCed or possibly added to an existing
          ARCed packet for the node that was prepared after
          Schedule-G.

          Note that before Schedule-G there would normally be no mail
          from the outgate to be processed, only mail from the nodes.
          Similarly after Schedule-V there is normally no mail from
          the nodes to be processed, only mail from the outgate.


          NODE 502 before and after morning mail period
          ---------------------------------------------

          arcmail from 620/500
          tossmail run -stats
          scanmail run -nopriv -stats
          arcmail to 620/500

          The node runs the same event for all mail processing.
     Fidonews                     Page 10                  29 Dec 1986


          Before the mail period the node tosses any echomail
          messages that may have been accidently left in the net mail
          message area from the previous mail time.  It then scans
          the echomail message areas for outbound messages.  All mail
          for the hub is then ARCed.

          After the mail period the node unARCs any mail received
          from the hub and tosses echomail into the appropriate
          message areas.

     To assist in developing a traffic analysis of the network we are
     asking all sysops to log statistical information on their
     echomail traffic, hence the use of the "-stats" option on
     tossmail and scanmail.  Please keep archives of these logs as we
     will be asking you to forward them so we can get on with the
     traffic analysis.  The ECHOMSGS.LOG generated by the "-stats"
     does not contain any information about the content of the
     messages or who sent them, only information on the number of
     messages processed out of each echomail area.

     To assist in keeping private mail out of echomail conferences we
     want you to use the "-nopriv" option with scanmail.  This will
     stop private "junk" echomail from cluttering up echomail
     conference areas.

     As ARCMAIL uses a external program to do the ARCing you must
     make sure that it is accessible to ARCMAIL by having it in the
     same directory or otherwise accessible through a PATH statement
     in DOS.


     OTHER SCHEDULES
     ---------------

     The ROUTEGEN.CTL you use will also build files for Schedule-R
     (Australian National Mail hour) and Schedule-T (International
     mail hour) for your convenience.  You may wish to edit these
     depending on your mail traffic requirements for file attaches
     etc.

     SPECIAL NOTES FOR FIDO + SEADOG USERS
     -------------------------------------

     Setting up for SEAdog is a lot easier than for Fido!  In Fido
     just set an external event starting at the time of your first
     mail event, not 5 minutes before. If you have set your pre-mail
     external event to occur 5 minutes before the mail event as we
     suggested, this will bring your Fido and SEAdog together as far
     as the no answer period just prior to an event.  SEAdog has a 5
     minutes no answer period while Fido has a 10 minute one.

     This external event, which should have the same exit errorlevel
     as your " /e" on your FIDOEXEC line.  The length of this event
     should run till the end of normal morning mail time plus 1
     minute.  You still have to setup the net/node numbers in Fido
     with the sysop 4 command and adjust your XLATLIST.CTL file plus
     your ROUTEGEN.CTL file.  You will need to change the node
     numbers in your CONFIG.DOG file.

     Take special note in the XLATLIST.CTL file as there are some
     special instructions for SEAdog users in it!

     Should you have any problems send a CRASH mail message to
     REALTORS (02) 387-5335 but only if you if you have SEAdog up and
     running on your board so that you can receive the CRASH reply!!
     (otherwise you just wont get a reply).

     A new Echo Conference devoted to discussion of various subjects
     effecting Software Engineers and MIS professionals has been
     started by SuperResume Fido in San Francisco, 125/612,
     415-546-0119.  SuperResume is operated by Lee Johnson, the
     owner of LEE JOHNSON INTERNATIONAL, a recruiting firm
     specializing in Software Engineering and MIS Professionals
     since 1974.  This 12 years of experience seeing candidates
     succeed and fail in their professional careers has provided
     some very interesting incites.  What is needed is a national
     forum to discuss these issues and bring together new ideas from
     a wide variety of professionals.  The proposed Echo Conference
     discussion areas are:

     1.  CARPLAN ........ Career Planning
     2.  COMP ........... Compensation Negotiation
     3.  CONTRACT ....... Contracting Pro & Con
     4.  COSTS .......... Cost-of-Living Comparisons
     5.  COUNTER ........ Counter Offer Experiences
     6.  GEOIND ......... Geographical/Job Market Activity
     7.  INTV ........... Interview Techniques/Experiences
     8.  JOMISA ......... JOBS: MIS - Applications
     9.  JOMISI ......... JOBS: MIS - Internals
     10. JOMISN ......... JOBS: MIS - Network/Comm.
     11. JOSEA .......... JOBS: Software Engineering - Applications
     12. JOSEI .......... JOBS: Software Engineering - Internals
     13. JOSEN .......... JOBS: Software Engineering - Network/Comm.
     14. RESCOMP ........ Resume Composition Ideas
     15. MISC ........... Software Careers Miscellaneous Subjects

     The file CARECHO.ARC is available for download on the
     SuperResume (tm) Fido (125/625 - 415-546-0119) for those who
     would like to participate in all or some of the above AREAS.
     It contains and ARC'd BACKUP.COM of all the subdirectories and
     dir.bbs's to make installation easy.

     In addition to coordinating the SOFTWARE CAREERS ECHO
     CONFERENCE, Lee Johnson is also making available his
     copyrighted SuperResume (tm) QUESTIONNAIRE.BBS file for Fido
     Sysops who wish to run it as the questionnaire feature of their
     Boards.  It produces a detailed, accomplishment-oriented
     resume.  This is extremely important because a resume is the
     single most important representation of a professional's
     career.  Many well qualified candidates never even get to first
     base (the interview) because they were screened-out due to an
     inadequate resume.  Nevertheless, most of people only think
     about their resume when they are considering changing jobs.  As
     a result, many deficient, flawed, and poorly constructed
     resumes are in circulation today, and many people's growth is
     being held back.

     Lee Johnson is also offering Fido Sysops A WAY TO DEFRAY A
     PORTION OF THE EXPENSE OF OPERATING THEIR BOARDS.   If a Board
     runs the SuperResume Questionnaire and obtains a completed
     SuperResume (or any resume) of a Software Engineering or MIS
     Professional candidate, Lee Johnson will pay a $500.00 US
     finder's fee to the Sysop and $50.00 US to the National FidoNet
     Fidonews                     Page 13                  29 Dec 1986


     Administrator if LJI successfully places that candidate.  If
     the Sysop personally interviews the candidate, and provides a
     written appraisal of the candidate, the finder's fee goes up to
     ten percent (10%) of LJI's gross fee, which sometimes can be
     $15,000, or a $1,500 finder's fee.   Detailed interviewing
     forms will be supplied if requested.

     If you are interested in either participating in the SOFTWARE
     CAREERS ECHO CONFERENCE, or in running the SuperResume (tm)
     Questionnaire (or both!), please contact Lee Johnson at:
     FidoMail 125/612; voiceline: 415-788-6000;
     dataline: 414-546-0119.

     The Med Tech FIDO (260/0, 260/10)

                      Western New York Net is formed
                      ==============================

          Effective with  NODELIST.353, the FIDO's of Western New York
     will be part of a new network: NET  260.   The systems comprising
     NET 260  are located in the Greater Buffalo and Greater Rochester
     areas.  Most members were  originally  in  NET  107;  others were
     independents in REGION 13.

          This reorganization will provide our area with more coherent
     communications by directly linking  local  NET  107  members (who
     previously had  to deal with New York City -- 400 miles away) and
     the local independents.   As an  added benefit,  NY MetroNet (NET
     107) should  feel some  relief from their currently heavy netmail
     traffic.

          If you send Net  Mail  (EchoMail)  to  any  of  the affected
     nodes, please make a note of the change.

          For reference, the following nodes are shown with former and
     current node designations:

                               What is Baud?

          Anyone reading technical echomail may have noticed  a  large
     number of messages about baud rates,  bit rates, band widths, and
     modulation techniques involved  with  modems.  There  is  a  fair
     amount of confusion relating to baud rate verses bit rate and how
     they  are  limited  by  the  telephone  line band width.  This is
     nothing new, texts on the subject generally avoid the term "baud"
     except within the  narrow  context  where  it  is  germane.  This
     article  will  define  some  of  the  various  terms used in data
     communications,   and  discuss  limitations  of  phone  lines  to
     communication speed.

          Serial  transmission  of  data  is the most common method of
     moving data over distance, and the most common way of interfacing
     serial devices to each other is RS232.  The essence of  RS232  is
     signal levels which represent ON or SPACE levels, and OFF or MARK
     levels.  ON  is  any voltage between +3 volts and +15 volts while
     OFF is -3 to -15 volts.  The signal shape is really a square wave
     centered  at  zero  volts  and  is a baseband signal.  A baseband
     signal is one whose spectrum extends down to zero hertz,  or near
     zero.  The signal is polled at regular intervals to determine its
     voltage,  and therefore the data it contains.  RS232 has only the
     two voltage levels defined  so  it  is  a  binary  coded  signal.
     Besides  signal  shape  and  levels,  RS232  defines  a number of
     parallel signals such as  "clear  to  send"  and  "data  terminal
     ready".  Some  of these signals are status flags such as "carrier
     detect",  while others are meant as flow control,  such as  "data
     terminal  ready"  or  "request  to  send".  Since a typical modem
     provides only  the  transmit  and  receive  functions,  the  flow
     control must be done within the data stream.  Some modems however
     send data as packets with error control (akin to XMODEM) that can
     recreate  all  of  the  hardware  signals so as to make a distant
     terminal appear to be hard wired.

          Regular phone lines were designed for voice  communications,
     but due to their wide use and therefore low cost,  they have been
     widely used for data communications. A baseband signal such as is
     found in RS232 doesn't lend itself  to  phone  lines  since  they
     don't  have frequency response down to D.C.  or zero hertz.  When
     voice grade phone lines were designed  the  band  of  frequencies
     they  had  to  pass was determined by the nature of human speech.
     Very low frequencies  (below  300  hz)  and  higher  ones  (above
     3000hz) were found to be unnecessary for voice recognition at the
     receiving end,  as a result the total "BAND WIDTH" available to a
     phone user is only around  2700  hz.  BAND  WIDTH  when  used  to
     describe  frequency  response  is the difference in hertz between
     the high and low, half power frequencies.  In electrical systems,
     power  dissipated  across  a  load  (or  resistance)  in terms of
     voltage is:  V * V / R.  Where "V"  in  this  case  will  be  the
     amplitude  of  the  sign  wave  being applied to the circuit.  In
     between the high and low half power frequencies there will  be  a
     Fidonews                     Page 16                  29 Dec 1986


     frequency  where  the  amplitude  of  the  response  wave will be
     maximized,  call that voltage Vm.  The half power points will  be
     reached  when V=Vm/sqrt(2).  The output power at that point would
     be Vm * Vm / (2 * R) which is one half the mid  band  power.  The
     cause  for  the fall off of power at different frequencies is due
     to capacitive and/or inductive elements in the circuit.  In phone
     lines capacitance comes naturally in parallel, that is it tend to
     shunt the signal to ground.  In this configuration the higher the
     frequency the lower the "resistance" will be. Inductance is added
     on purpose by the phone companies in the form  of  loading  coils
     which  are  added  to  decrease  signal  attenuation  in  the mid
     frequencies.  In any case the band width of a voice grade line is
     strictly limited so that many calls can be stacked on top of each
     other, in order to use transmission lines more effectively.  Data
     equipment must strive to make the best use of  this  narrow  band
     width.  There  is  a hard limit to the amount of data that can be
     sent through a telephone line as will be seen later.

          The signal type of choice to carry data through phone  lines
     is  the  sine wave.  A sine wave has but one frequency associated
     with it. This means that if its frequency is within th band width
     of the line carrying it,  then the received sine  wave  will  not
     have  its  shape  altered  due  to clipping of the high frequency
     components.  This can't be said  for  the  square  or  triangular
     waves  which  requires  an  infinite band width to fully describe
     them.  The sine wave is simply defined:

         v= A * sin( w*t + p)
            A is the amplitude (in units of volts for this exercise)
            w is the frequency which must be in radians per second
            t is time in seconds
            p is the phase angle in radians

          Information can  be  encoded  by  the  sine  wave  in  three
     different  ways.  By  altering  "A" which is amplitude modulation
     (AM),  by altering "w" which is frequency modulation (FM),  or by
     altering  "p"  which  is  phase modulation (PM).  There are mixed
     modes which come into use in the more exotic modem schemes,  used
     to get the really high bit rates.

          FSK  or  frequency  shift  keying  was  the most widely used
     method for data transfer through modems.  This is  a  FM  process
     whereby  a RS232 MARK would be represented by the presence of one
     frequency while a SPACE would be indicated by another  frequency.
     Now is the time to introduce the term BAUD.  A "BAUD" is the time
     interval in which data is carried,  that is the minimum  time  in
     which  a  signal  holds  a  single state which the receiver is to
     recognize and convert into data.  The baud rate is how many  BAUD
     times occur in a second. The baud rate is NOT the same as the bit
     rate  as will be seen later in multiple state modulation.  In FSK
     type modems (Bell 103) the baud time happens to be  the  same  as
     the  bit rate since each signal state encodes a single bit.  Many
     would think that the baud rate is limited  to  highest  frequency
     available to be transmitted (3000 hz) but this is not necessarily
     so.  Nyquist  showed  in 1928 that the maximum signal change rate
     (baud rate) for a band width "W"  would  be  2*W  baud.  This  is
     Fidonews                     Page 17                  29 Dec 1986


     called  the  Nyquist  rate  and is an upper limit that assumes no
     inter-symbol  interference.   This   could   be   visualized   by
     considering  a sine wave.  Each cycle has a positive and negative
     part.  The amplitude in each part could be independently  altered
     while still having a sine wave,  therefore a 1200 hz signal could
     be changed 2400 times a second which is 2400 baud.  This type  of
     change  (AM)  is  not  very useful in phone lines since it is the
     type of change most commonly caused by natural phenomena. In Bell
     103 the baud rate is commonly 300 which is over 3.5 cycles at the
     lowest  carrier  frequency.   The  practical  considerations   of
     detecting frequency changes requires about 1.5 cycles so 300 baud
     is some what conservative.

          PSK or phase shift keying gets by the frequency barrier that
     keeps  FSK  from  producing  the  higher bit rates.  In PSK (a PM
     method) the only parameter in the sine wave changed each BAUD  is
     the  phase  angle  "p".  The Bell 212A modem specification uses a
     four level phase modulation technique.  The term four level means
     that  four different phases are used and detected by the receiver
     during each BAUD.  The number  of  bits  an  M  level  state  can
     represent  is n=log2(M) or log(M)/log(2).  A four level state can
     represent two bits during each baud.  In the  212A  specification
     +90 degrees would be 00,  0 degrees 01, +270 degrees 11, and +180
     degrees 10.  The 212A baud rate is 600 which means the  bit  rate
     would be:

     bit rate=600 BAUD/second * 2 bits/BAUD= 1200 bits/second

          To  increase  the bit rate to the next state would require 3
     bits/baud or 8 phases.  To get 2400 bps using such a scheme would
     require  16  different  phases (22.5 degrees apart).  The problem
     here is that one class of noise present  in  phone  lines  called
     "phase jitter" can cause phase errors up to and sometimes over 30
     degrees.  To avoid the bulk of this type of noise the phase angle
     difference should be kept above this amount. The 2400 baud modems
     common today use a form of QAM (quadrature amplitude  modulated).
     This  method  uses  a  combination  of  two  waves with different
     amplitudes to get the required 16 levels.  A QAM  signal  can  be
     expressed in equation as follows:

     s(t)=a(t)cos(wt+p)+b(t)cos(wt+90+p)

     a(t)  is  the  in-phase  modulating  wave  form while b(t) is the
     quadrature modulating wave form.  During each baud a(t) and  b(t)
     are constants so the equation simplifies to:

     s(tn)=c*cos(wt+theta+p)   {p is a single arbitrary phase angle tn
                               stands  for  a   specific   baud   time
                               c=sqrt(a*a+b*b) theta=atan(b/a)}

     The   new  pure  sine  (cosine)  wave  has  amplitude  and  phase
     differences which can multiply the number of states possible.  If
     there  are 4 values for amplitude and 8 values for phase then the
     signal could have 32 different states or five  bits.  The  random
     variations  in  phase  "p"  has  less effect the outcome since it
     effects  both  waves  the  same.  The  phase  difference  in  the
     Fidonews                     Page 18                  29 Dec 1986


     resultant  wave  is due to the interaction of the two wave forms.
     QAM is the method used to get up to 9600  baud  out  of  a  phone
     line. Other types of noise are present in a phone system, and are
     mostly  due  to  switching  and cross over with other wires.  The
     error rate at the higher bit rates would be unacceptable if there
     weren't some error recovery used.  This is now quite easy  to  do
     from a hardware standpoint, since the memory and processing power
     needed  to  do  it  takes a small amount of space and cost little
     enough to make the increase in bit rate  worth  it.  The  ability
     for high speed modems to run will increase due to another reason.
     More  and  more  fiber optic phone line will replace conventional
     ones. These are immune from many of the noise sources that effect
     copper wires, sources such as RF and magnetic fields.

     The ultimate bit rate that could be "pumped" through a phone line
     is fixed by the  band  width  AND  the  signal  to  noise  ratio.
     Shannon's  law  relates  random  bit transmissions/second to band
     width and signal to noise ratio.  It is derived from the  concept
     of entropy. Entropy is a measure of randomness in a system. It is
     really   a   thermodynamic   property  but  has  applications  in
     information theory.  The maximum bit  rate  for  a  channel  with
     signal power S and noise power N is given by:

     C=BW log2(1+S/N) where BW is the band width, S is the signal
                      power and N is the noise power.

     With  a  typical band width 2600 hz and a typical signal to noise
     ratio of 30db (or 1000/1) the bit rate would be:

     bit rate=2600 * log2( 1001 ) or 25,914bps

     The noise factor is assumed white or Gaussian. This kind of noise
     is  unavoidable  in  electrical  systems.  In  fact  "N"  can  be
     calculated by:

     N=kTW   where k=1.37e-23 joule/degree
                   T is absolute temperature (Kelvin)
                   W is the band width in HZ

     This  product  gives  "N" in terms of joules per second or watts.
     At room temperatures noise would be on the order of  1e-17  watts
     over a 2600 hz band width.  If a phone signal were just 0.1 watts
     the signal to noise ratio could be as high as 160db.  In practice
     it  is  about 30db so it can be expected that the signal to noise
     ratio will increase in the future so that the top bit rates  will
     increase,  and  this  increase will happen without an increase of
     the band width available.

          One last problem to consider with the high speed  modems  is
     compatibility.  To  get  9600  bps  from  a 600 baud signal would
     require 65,536 levels in a state.  There is  no  obvious  way  in
     which  to  assign a level to a 16 bit pattern so the manufacturer
     must invent an "ALPHABET" for that conversion.  Until an alphabet
     is  standardized  as  well  as error recovery techniques there is
     simply no way the modems will talk to each other.

     Amplitude modulation: Where information is encoded by changes in
                           amplitude only.
     Band width:           Range of frequencies within the half power
                           limits. That is the difference between the
                           two -3db frequencies.
     Baseband:             The signal at its original frequency and
                           shape.
     Baud:                 The minimum time where all signal
                           parameters are held constant.
     Baud rate:            The number of times the basic signal can be
                           changed per second.
     Bit rate:             The number if bits per second passing
                           through a channel. In a modem it is the

     David Kohen, 164/7

                               Writer wanted

     Hi!   I'm  the  Technical  Editor  for  a  new  Hong  Kong  based
     magazine,and  I'm  looking for someone,  or someones,  to write a
     regular column on the North American computer scene.

     What we're looking for is something a lot like Jerry  Pournelle's
     Chaos Manor in Byte (you can take that as a compliment, Jerry, if
     you come across this),  with coverage of events, conferences, new
     products, etc. Since we can't, yet, offer Byte's kind of money or
     expenses,  we really need someone who is working  in  the  field,
     gets around,  can write and wants to earn some extra money.  Most
     of the time you'll decide for yourself what you  want  to  cover.
     Occasionally we'll ask you to do something specific.

     We're  also  open  to  receiving  articles  on  a  one-off basis,
     including reviews,  programs etc.  We'll pay on a sliding  scale,
     according  to  how much editing is needed,  for text,  photos and
     programs.

     All submissions should be supplied on IBM compatible disk. In the
     case of programs they should be  heavily  annotated,  and  public
     domain  (they'll  all be posted on SEAnet,  our local Fido host).
     IBM,  Mac and Unix-based programs are more  likely  to  get  into
     print, the Amiga and Atari STs are not available here.  Obviously
     Mac  programs should be on a Mac disk (although we'd still prefer
     the text in IBM format if possible, we don't yet have an in-house
     Mac).

     If you are interested, or you know someone else who is,  I can be
     reached by mail at:

             1911, C.C. Wu Building,
             302 Hennessy Road,
             Wanchai,
             Hong Kong.
