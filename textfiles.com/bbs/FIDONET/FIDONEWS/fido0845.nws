Editorial: stuff, and an apology

by Tom Jennings 1:1/1

Last week I generated enough text to last a few weeks, so I'll stop
here. Oh, just this one last thing. If you have any historical
documents (like the old FIDOHISTs, procedural docs pre-POLICYn,
"ettiquette" docs, whatever) please mail 'em on to 1:1/1. I'm starting
a collection.

Well, another thing. I've got word that a number of people have been
having trouble sending my article submissions. It took a long and
circuitous loop of people to get word to me.

I have to ask that if you have problems, you send me a message, with
as much information as you have. At least, what you were trying to do
(file attach? message only?), your program/version, a working node
number (in FidoNet only, not other-nets, I'm not connected to any
gateways), and log fragment or error message if you have one.

Half of those I did get reports on, turned out to be "other" problems
-- for example one program in series had a max. message length limit,
and destroyed the messsage while in transit (neither mine nor the
authors' system).

For demonstrable, persistent problems, let me know, and I'll sit and
watch my system receive what you're sending; I can debug 99% of
protocol problems from my logging scheme (at least well enough to tell
what's broken).

And at the least, if I'm not aware of problems, I certainly can't be
expected to fix 'em.

I am running Fido/FidoNet 12u, which as far as I know is pretty good
with both FSC-0001 and Wazoo, but problems with all our programs do
happen.


And lastly, I owe Thom Henderson an apology.

re: Last week's article regarding Thom Hendersons FIDOCON'91 article.

1) It was listed on the schedule as the "Developers Roundtable".
Nobody in the audience was there because they wanted to hear Randy
pontificate. They were there because they wanted to hear you, and me,
and the other DEVELOPERS. It was very rude of Randy to attempt to
dominate the session from the floor.

2) It is also very rude and childish of YOU to snipe from the
sidelines by adding "comments" to submitted articles. You already get
the first word by writing the editorial. Your "comments" are not only
ambiguous in origin (C programmers may recognize your comment marks,
but others are quite likely to assume that your words are part of the
submitted article), they also smack of a person who cannot bear not
having the last word.



I stand here, red-faced. You are right, I cannot defend my actions.
While comments after articles are sometimes appropriate, in this case
they were not. My apologies once again. --tomj

      NEW FCC RULE THREATENS HIGHER LONG DISTANCE COSTS FOR BBS'S
      ===========================================================


o WHAT'S HAPPENING?

In July the FCC, in an action virtually unnoticed by the bulletin
board community, issued its "Final Rule" in Docket 89-79.  The
innocuous-sounding title is "Amendments of Part 69 of the Commission's
Rules Relating to the Creation of Access Charge Subelements for Open
Network Architecture."  Industry sources estimate that this rule, when
fully implemented, will result in an average increase of from three to
five times the current costs for users of "Enhanced Service Providers
(ESPs)," such as GEnie, Compuserve, PC Pursuit and Starlink.

Already someone is reading this and saying something like:

"Hoo boy!  Doesn't this jerk realize that's an old rumor?"

Well, I'm sorry to say I wish it was, but it isn't.  For those who
want to know all the details (and I'm one of them), the Notice of
Proposed Rule Making NPRM is 89-79, FCC 89-105, and the Final Rule was
announced at 56 Fed Reg 33879-01 on July 24th, 1991.  It took effect
on August 23, 1991.

What it seems to me, after some hours of research and analysis, is
that the FCC is attempting to do indirectly in 1991 what it could not
do directly in 1987.  If you remember the history, in 1983 the FCC
created the access charge structure.  It granted exemptions from
usage-sensitive access charges for Enhanced Service Providers (ESPs)
for a number of reasons.

In 1987, Docket 87-215, the FCC proposed to remove the exemptions.  We
all know what happened then.  The Commission and Congress received an
unprecedented public input on a telecommunications regulatory issue.
The plan to remove the exemptions was dropped.

While Rep. Markey, among others, thought the idea was dead, period,
the Commission appears to have merely gone into hiatus.

The current rule, if I have it analyzed correctly, attempts to do
three things:
FidoNews 8-45                  Page 5                      11 Nov 1991


    1.  Preserve ESP exemptions "in their current form."

    2.  Create incentives for new services, known as BSEs, under
        the ONA  proposals.  ESPs would have to pay access charges to
        use these services.

    3.  Ultimately require the removal of the existing feature
        groups the BSEs would replace.

The result in the end, usage-sensitive access charges for ESPs,
the very concept thought killed in 1987.


o WHY ARE WE JUST HEARING ABOUT IT?

The "posture of the proceeding" is important.  When the FCC issued the
NPRM in 1989, it seemed to imply that the exemptions would continue,
so no one got real upset. This was, after all, only 18 months or so
after the 87-215 fiasco.

When the final rule was released in July, effective in August, it
took people a while to figure out the probable impact.  As a result,
what the Enhanced Service Providers and others are asking for from
their users is support for their petition to reconsider the rule.


o OKAY, YOU CONVINCED ME!  WHAT SHOULD I DO?

Public input, to the FCC, to key Congressmen and Senators, and to your
own Congressional delegation, will likely make a difference now, just
like it did in 1987.  GEnie, among the services I use, has taken the
lead on generating public input.  The last part of this article is the
GEnie "Call to Action."  Some of you may have seen it before.

  +------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | If you do choose to write, please do NOT call it a "modem tax."  |
  | It isn't a tax at all, and most likely you'll be told (with a    |
  | straight face) there isn't any such proposal.  To the best of my |
  | knowledge this is *NOT* the case.  No new taxes on existing      |
  | services are currently under consideration.                      |
  +------------------------------------------------------------------+

The issue which we need to mention is the FCC's *approved* pricing for
Open Network Architecture (ONA) services [passed by the Commission on
July 11, 1991 as part of CC Docket No. 89-79 "Amendments of Part 69 of
the Commission's Rules Relating to the Creation of Access Charge
Subelements for Open Network Architecture"].  We need to ask the
Commission to reconsider its decision to require "enhanced service
providers" and other end users that wish to subscribe to federally
tariffed basic service elements, to pay usage-based rates for access
to these new services.  You should write the Commission, supporting
this request for reconsideration.
FidoNews 8-45                  Page 6                      11 Nov 1991


o WHAT DO I SAY?

Here's the GEnie "Call to Action" (reproduced verbatim with
permission):

"The Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") has adopted rules that
will increase by up to five-fold the price of local telephone lines
that use new network features to provide access to information
services.  The new rules could have as serious an impact as the FCC's
1987 access charge proposal, which was successfully defeated through a
massive letter-writing campaign.

"Any information service provider that wishes to take advantage of new
network features -- which are to be made available as part of the
FCC's Open Network Architecture ("ONA") -- must start paying the
higher charges.  Although the FCC would allow information service
providers to continue using their existing lines at current rates,
providers choosing this option would be denied the use of much
existing and future network functionality.  Many state regulators are
compounding this problem by following the FCC's lead.

"These pricing rules will needlessly inflate the costs of providing
information services.  Information service providers will have no
option but to pass these added costs on to their subscribers in
increased prices.  This is bad for the information service providers,
bad for subscribers, and bad for the United States.  At a time when
the FCC should be encouraging the widest possible use and availability
of information services, the FCC has adopted rules that will have
precisely the opposite effect.

"It's not too late to stop the FCC from implementing its new ONA
pricing rules.  GEnie (through its trade associations ADAPSO and IIA),
CompuServe, Prodigy, BTNA (formerly Tymnet) and others have petitioned
the FCC to reconsider its rules, and the FCC is now considering
whether it should grant those petitions.

"You can help by writing to Al Sikes, Chairman of the FCC, and sending
copies of your letter to his fellow Commissioners.  You should also
write to Congressman Ed Markey and Senator Daniel Inouye, the Chairmen
of the House and Senate Subcommittees that have jurisdiction over the
FCC.  (You may also wish to send copies of your letters to your own
U.S. Senators and Representative).


"Tell them that:

  -  You use information services and how you use them.

  -  You will curtail your use of these services if prices increase
     as a result of the FCC's new ONA pricing rules.

FidoNews 8-45                  Page 7                      11 Nov 1991


  -  The FCC's new ONA pricing rules will create the wrong incentives
     by discouraging information service providers from taking
     advantage of new network features.

  -  The FCC should reconsider the rules it adopted in Docket 89-79
     and allow information service providers to use new network
     features without being required to pay usage-sensitive access
     charges that are three to five times higher than existing rates.

Thom Henderson
System Enhancement Associates, Inc.


                  Announcing Kitten BBS version 1.01

Maybe you've seen Kitten before, but not like this!  And if Kitten is
new to you, then you're REALLY in for a treat!

Kitten is the programmable BBS from System Enhancement Associates.
Don't let the "programmable" part scare you -- if you can write a
batch file, you can program Kitten.  Sysops running Kitten have called
it "a script that answers the phone", or even "the batch file BBS".
The possibilities are almost limitless.

Kitten is controlled completely by text script files written in the
MEOW (Mnemonic Execution of Operator Wishes) language.  You can use
either of two sample setups provided with Kitten, or you can go off on
your own as far as your imagination can roam.  Here are just a few of
the features offerred by Kitten version 1.01:

  * 26 string variables, stored between calls

  * 26 numeric variables, stored per user

FidoNews 8-45                  Page 9                      11 Nov 1991


  * 32 user flags, stored with the user data, allowing all sorts of
    access customization and special effects

  * External protocols to allow a wide range of file transfer
    capability to your users

  * Internal support for PC Board, RBBS, QBBS, and RA door programs

  * Internal support for running any arbitrary program that performs
    standard character I/O, with carrier watchdog and time limiting.

  * Support for Caller*ID, either via a Caller*ID modem or by using a
    separate Caller*ID interface (such as the Classmate 10).

  * 57 system variables, giving you consistent access to user and
    system data in menus, download lists, and even in text files!

  * Conditional expressions, allowing you to make menus that customize
    themselves on the fly

  * "Mark and go" file download management, which can give your users
    a "clipboard" for selecting downloads

  * Wildcard searches, keyword searches, and "new file" searches in
    file download areas.

  * Multiline support (when used with SEAmail)


And that's just scratching the surface!  Let me give you an example of
what you can do.  Suppose that you want to enforce a file
download/upload ratio of ten to one.  Kitten doesn't do that
automatically, but don't let THAT stop you!  Take a look at this:

    "(D)ownload files
    if %fdnlds% * 10 < %fuplds%
         *D echo I'm sorry, but you must maintain a ratio of 10 to 1
    else
         *D dnld files
    endif

Let me explain that piece by piece.

    "(D)ownload files
    ^^
    ||
    |This is menu text displayed to the user.
    |
    The quote means that this line is menu text.

    if %fdnlds% < %fuplds% * 10
FidoNews 8-45                  Page 10                     11 Nov 1991


    ^  ^
    |  |
    |  This is an arithmetic expression.  "%FDNLDS%" is how many files
    |  the user has downloaded.  %FUPLOADS% is how many he's uploaded.
    |  From there on it should be obvious.
    |
    This means that this line is a conditional expression.

         *D echo I'm sorry, but you must maintain a ratio of 10 to 1
         ^^ ^    ^
         || |    |
         || |    This is the text that is echoed.
         || |
         || This is the menu command.  This one tells Kitten to show
         || the text to the user.
         ||
         |This is the key the user hits to trigger this command.
         |
         The asterisk means that this line is a menu command.

I think you can take it from there.  Hopefully this gives you a taste
of the power and flexibility that Kitten brings to you.

Kitten can be obtained free of charge by calling the SEA Technical
Support BBS (SEAboard) at (201) 473-1991, or you can file request
KITTEN10.ARC from any of the following network addresses:

GoldEd - A fully-featured Sysop/Point message reader/editor for the
IBM-PC and compatibles

Written by Odinn Sorensen

David Peterson
Dippy's Point
3:635/504.4

Message reading is the one of the better parts of BBSing, and I have
been after an easy-to-use and powerful editor/reader since I became a
point. Luckily, I stumbled across GoldEd. GoldEd has made message
reading and writing easier than ever with a simple interface that can
perform everything from the basic, to the advanced.

FidoNews 8-45                  Page 11                     11 Nov 1991


This article will try to point out some of GoldEd's features, so people
who are after a better way to handle messages can become more
productive. Note that I am not associated with Odinn Sorensen, the
author, in any way apart from talking to him via netmail a few times,
and registering the product. I'm just a very happy user!

GoldEd definitely IS a fully featured message reader and editor. Almost
everything is user definable, from message areas, to language files,
and message templates.

GoldEd has all the standard equipment for any message editor, including
Replying to a message, Quote-Replying, Comment Replying (Replying to
the TO name), Moving, Copying, Deleting, Exporting and Forwarding (in
the same or a different area) of messages and changing of a message
after it has been written. GoldEd also has keys to move to the next,
and previous messages, as well as next and previous in a thread, the
first and last in an area, a particular message number, the next and
previous area and more. Carbon Copy and Crosspost are also supported.

Most known kludges and all attributes are supported, including extended
QBBS/RA attributes. Any of these can be changed at any time.

On start up of the program, a welcome screen is displayed. Where GoldEd
goes next is user definable, but the default action is to move straight
to the message area selection. Message areas in GoldEd can come from
several different sources at the same time, from a QBBS/RA Hudson-type
message base, to the Fido .msg style.

The area selection screen shows the ECHOMAIL ID of the area (if
applicable), as well as an extended message area description. The total
number of messages, and number of the last message read are the two
other columns in this screen.

One thing should be mentioned about the message numbers. GoldEd
internally renumbers each message area, so messages are numbered
sequentially starting at one. This allows instantaneous knowledge of
how many messages are in an area, and where you are in the area. This
does not change the ACTUAL message numbers. Again, this is user
configurable - GoldEd can still display the REAL message numbers if
wished.

Once an area has been selected, the message reading screen appears.
This screen is divided into three sections. The first, occupying the
top six lines of the screen, shows the writer and recipient, message
number, date and time, subject and other header information. The bottom
line (line 25, or 43/50 on extended screens) holds a small GoldEd logo,
information on the current status of the program (Reading, editing
etc), memory free and current time. The rest of the screen is devoted
to the message contents.

Colors (also user definable) play a prominent part of the message text.
The message body takes one color, quotes take another and kludge lines
and origin/tear information a third. If the message is to or from you,
your name will be highlighted If you have not read the message yet,
GoldEd will beep (also user-definable). Kludge lines can be hidden or
shown and twit messages (Messages to/from a person or subject) can be
FidoNews 8-45                  Page 12                     11 Nov 1991


skipped. A page bar appears on the right hand side of the page that
shows which portion of the whole message is being viewed.

GoldEd can display a list of all messages in an area, for quick
scrolling. There is also a very powerful message marking facility. Any
particular message, or a group of messages can be marked. You can also
mark your personal mail, messages in the current thread, or messages
with a certain string within the header of body. These marked messages
can then be moved, copied, deleted etc just the same as with one
message. Another option screens the messages so only those that are
marked are shown, and read. As yet, GoldEd cannot automatically scan
for personal mail in all areas (a planned future feature), but personal
messages can be scanned, marked, read, and replied to in each area
without scanning through every other new message.

GoldEd can search the messages in an area from the current message, and
find a string in the message header of body. GoldEd can either stop on
the first message found, or mark all messages containing the string.
This is very handy for reading all messages from or to a certain
person, or to find a particular message when all that was remembered
about that message was one or two key words.

A 'bookmark' is also implemented. This bookmark can be set, and jumped
back to at any time. Another feature allows the current message in a
thread can be book marked, and the thread be scanned. Press the "jump"
key to return to where you left off sequential reading.

As already mentioned, GoldEd is completely user-definable, with all
commands definable by easy-to-change configuration files. Future plans
by the author include writing a setup program, so the configuration
files are not needed.

Message areas can be defined within these configuration files, or
GoldEd can be instructed to read the areas from another format.
Currently supported formats include FD, Opus, ME2, Imail, Tosscan,
Maximus, RA, QBBS, Duchie, D'Bridge and AREAS.BBS.

GoldEd has an internal editor, and supports a user definable external
editor. Messages with the external editor can be handled using a
HARDLINE feature. Briefly, you type your message into the editor, and
where you wish a paragraph to end, you can either leave a blank line
after the end, or place a user definable hardline character (I use the
default, <<). GoldEd uses these characters to re-format the message to
look respectable before sending. Also supported is a way to place logs,
or program text, where you don't want GoldEd to reformat the text.
Quotes in reply messages are also re-flowed, so there is no nasty
effect where one line is quoted into 2 lines, where the second line
contains one word.

Message templates and origin lines are also fully user-configurable. A
Template provides a "Template" of the message, holding macros that
define where GoldEd will place the recipient's name, the sender's name,
the reply text, as well as any other information that can be provided.
There is also a very good "Cookie" generation system, that places a
random piece of text in every message. I use this feature to place
either of "David", "David Peterson", "David 'Dippy' Peterson", "Dippy"
FidoNews 8-45                  Page 13                     11 Nov 1991


and a few multiple line tags to the end of my messages. There can be
multiple message templates per area, and different areas can have the
same template.

Multiple origin and tear lines can be defined for any area, with a
random choice being made by GoldEd if more than one is defined. I have
a lot of interesting origin lines setup for my local areas, and two
variations of "Dippy's Point - Pointing off High Voltage" for the
national and international echos I receive. When quoting origin lines,
they can be invalidated automatically. A quoted " * Origin" can be
converted to " ! Origin", and tear lines can be changed from "---" to
"-!-" so that old message tossers and readers are not confused. This
technique can also apply to SEEN-BY's. The replacement string is user
configurable.

Another powerful addition to GoldEd recently, has been the facility for
a Spell Checker. The actual spell checker is not in-built, but
external. GoldEd includes a key to shell out to the checker, and
re-load the message into the internal editor once it has been checked.
A Grammar checker can also be placed here. Macros are supported to a
limited extent. I do not use this feature, so cannot comment on it.

As mentioned previously, GoldEd's configuration files include the
facility to change ANY message that is placed on the screen. This means
that alternate languages, or just a Customization to suit an
individual's tastes, can be catered for.

The nodelist can be read by GoldEd and Netmail messages can be
addressed to a node number (with GoldEd automatically looking for and
inserting the sysop name). The full nodelist can be browsed if wished.
File attaches, and requests are fully supported, with a selectable file
list being generated if wild cards are specified as the file request.

Among other user-definable features, GoldEd supports Character
translation (The standards described in FSC-0050, FSC-0051 and FSC-0054
are three of the types supported), configurable online help, a totally
reconfigurable keyboard, ROT 13 en/decryption and Areasort (areas with
the most number of unread messages are placed first in the area list).

The last public release of GoldEd was 2.31, but GoldEd revisions are
available, and are up to 2.31p currently. There is a new release
expected within the next month. Odinn allows all registered users to
become beta testers, with these users being able to request the latest
beta from most support sites.

GoldEd has a few bugs, but most of them have been stamped out in 2.31p
(the version I am using). The internal message editor has a few
problems with word wrapping when typing near the end of the line, but
Odinn has assured us that that will be totally fixed in a future
version (he originally imported the source for another, already buggy,
editor into GoldEd. While he fixed most of the bugs, he has decided to
write one of his own). Another minor gripe is the disk space needed to
hold GoldEd's nodelist index files. They use nearly 690K of disk space
for the full day 298 nodelist. Of course, if not using Netmail, the
nodelist is not needed.

GoldEd has supported message base sharing on and off in the last few
betas. It was implemented, but due to some problems, was taken out. It
is now implemented again, in version 2.31p. The Author suggests that
care should be taken though, as the feature has not been tested by him
(He doesn't have a multitasking machine, or network).

There are seven support sites located worldwide. GoldEd can be
registered from any of these sites, and the latest BETA is available to
registered versions.

A echomail area for GoldEd support is available on all major back bones
around the world. The author is present, and does his best to answer
questions. Most support sites are also active in this echo. The area is
requestable with the name GOLDED.

Registration of GoldEd costs DKK 250, or US$40. If registering from the
author directly, an extra currency conversion cost is needed. This is
not necessary when registering with a local site. The non-registered
version of GoldEd is only crippled in the use of the tear line : It can
not be changed. Registration lifts this restriction.

GoldEd is an ongoing program, and the author plans to implement more
features into future versions. A few of these features include a new
internal editor, scanning for personal mail in all areas, replies
reading mode, Nodelist browsing in levels a'la FrontDoor, Xpress and
XRS compatibility, other message formats such as XBBS, better mouse
support, conditional macros and macro recording, Windows 3 version
(GoldEd 3.xx) and many other features!

From the day I first unpacked the GoldEd archive, I have been hooked.
On my recommendations, my Fido Boss looked at the archive too, and is
now hooked as well. We are now both registered users, and very happy.
GoldEd does not suit every application, but points and sysops, will
benefit greatly, with reduced message reading time, which makes more
time for users.

GoldEd should be available at your local BBS under the name GOLD????,
where ???? is the version number.
