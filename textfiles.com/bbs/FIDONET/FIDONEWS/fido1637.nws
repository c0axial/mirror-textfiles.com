     =================================================================

     Greetings,

     This is my last day as your editor of FidoNews.  As from next week's
     issue, Douglas Myers will be your new editor.

     I would like to thank all of you who so kindly supported me.

     Ofcourse, there's no thanks for those who always bigger and want
     nothing more than to be boss of our hobby FidoNet.  This is a great
     pitty, that SysOp's cannot stand together to make FidoNet a better
     network to be in.

     Keep well and I'll be around to watch from the sideline. :-)

     Happy reading,

     If you hold your ear very close to your POP3 server, you can hear
     the roar of an ocean of injustice.  Is the government reading your
     email?  Will the telephone company be able to charge you long
     distance surcharges for your data connections?  Will your ISP be
     required to limit your selections on the web?

     This week's email sounded a clarion call alerting me the the latest
     attempt to trample my personal freedoms:


     ----- excerpt from email -----

     Under proposed legislation the U.S. Postal Service will be
     attempting to bilk email users out of "alternate postage fees". Bill
     602P will permit the Federal Govt. to charge a 5 cent surcharge on
     every email delivered, by billing Internet Service Providers at
     source. The consumer would then be billed in turn by the ISP.
     ..
     The U.S. Postal Service is claiming that lost revenue due to the
     proliferation of email is costing nearly $230,000,000 in revenue per
     year.
     ..
     Since the average citizen received about 10 pieces of email per day
     in 1998, the cost to the typical individual would be an additional
     50 cents per day, or over $180 dollars per year, above and beyond
     their regular Internet costs.

     -------- end excerpt ---------


     To save space, I've not included the usual rhetoric about the
     efficiency of the post office and the federal government in general,
     nor the dire warnings about giving the government a foothold to
     strip us of a free internet.  It is presumed that the reader is
     already familiar with the concept.

     The letter did go on to say that all major newspapers are ignoring
     the story, so I thought I'd address it in Fidonews :)

     To begin with, I'm not sure that there is a Bill 602P - sometimes
     these letters don't restrict themselves to the facts.  But if there
     is a Bill 602P, it won't recover the USPS' lost revenues - if the
     post office is losing $0.33 per letter and only recovering $0.05 per
     letter, then it's only going to recover about $35 million of its
     lost $230 million. This is a figure almost beneath Uncle Sam's
     notice... unless he takes the following two steps to bolster revenue
     FIDONEWS 16-37               Page 3                   13 Sep 1999


     significantly:

     1.  Surcharge email received rather than email sent.  This would
     have the double benefit encouraging spammers to work for free as
     agents of the United States Government as well as drawing
     significant revenue from folks with an email account who just aren't
     creative enough to write much.

     2.  Consider newsgroups to be email.  The ALT groups alone could
     wipe out the national debt!  Of course, if the concept were extended
     to include echomail, then the Zone 1 Backbone would be scrambling to
     recover all those echoes they've dropped, as low volume echoes would
     suddenly be in vogue.


     In calculating lost revenues, the Post Office needs to look beyond
     email to other forms of communication.  For example, Postal
     Inspectors could walk into the Churches and Synagogues and Temples
     of our nation and surcharge all those prayers to God.  None of them
     bear a postage stamp, to the best of my knowledge.  Better yet, they
     could surcharge prayers at home - three meals per day and bedtime
     prayers.  Compliance with this latter is expected to be high...
     after all, would YOU be willing to tell the government that you
     don't say your prayers at beddy-bye?

     And the Postal Inspectors could march into the singles bars
     throughout the land on the alert for body language.  After all, it
     all goes unstamped except for possibly an occasional woman who's
     been hit upon one too many times.  Of course, Postal Inspectors are
     a dry lot and might miss some of the body language.  Perhaps it's
     time for a new concept here:  outcome-based surcharing.  For
     example, a man or woman who draws a smile could be charged for one
     letter.  A whistle would be worth three letters.  If one actually
     scores, he or she could appeal for bulk rate.

     Pay attention to the roar of the ocean in your mailbox... you just
     never know what's going to wash ashore...
