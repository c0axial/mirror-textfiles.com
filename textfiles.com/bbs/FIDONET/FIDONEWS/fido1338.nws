     Does it really matter how long FidoNews or any of its component
     sections becomes? Is there a qualitative difference between a FidoNews
     of 50K and one of 110K? With today's high speed modems and byte
     scrunching archivers, is concern about a 150 line Masthead genuine or
     just that habit of complaint so common in many FidoNet venues? Let's
     stop picking nits for sport and start making actual contributions to
     this hobby. Break the habit. Send something positive into FidoNews. We
     still need ASCII art for the Comix section [even if it adds 10K to the
     weekly Issue]. [grin]

     Nearly three months after the change and we still have NO UPDATE to
     the Zone 3 section of our Nodelist in Zone 1. Who is sitting on their
     hands in this lack of exchange? Somebody please step up and get us an
     accurate Nodelist! Would an IC be a good idea? [sheesh]

     Don't forget that FidoNews goes into ZIP archive format beginning with
     Issue 1340 on 30 Sep 96. Get those batch file adjustments ready.

       NOTE: NODELIST.257 shows 1:1/23 and 1:1/113 [FidoNews & OpusHelp]
             with the NEW phone numbers in Edgewater_FL but they were
             changed two weeks EARLY so DON'T try to send to them now. Use
             my primary Node [1:1/374] or put the current number in as an
             override for 1:1/23 and 1:1/113. The current number is:

                           1-407-383-1372 in Titusville_FL.

             The new number [1-904-409-7040] will not be active UNTIL
             27 Sep 96!

     Thanks.

     What do we want FidoNet to be?
     by Fredrik Bennison  --  2:205/300, lomaxx@dalnet.se

     I'm glad to see that my articles stirred up some response, that at
     least shows that this old Snooze of ours still manages to be
     interesting enough
     to read.

     I'd like to comment on two articles in FidoNews 1337, to clarify my
     point of view and to perhaps inspire others to write their views as
     well.

     Firstly, Mr Fredric Rice (nice name by the way... 8) states that it is
     better to vote NCs that doesn't perform certain duties out of office
     rather than implementing more rules regarding their behaviour in
     Policy.  I agree, if a NC or RC or whatever doesn't perform the duties
     that can be expected of them, one should try to remove them
     democratically and replace them with another person that would perhaps
     perform more satisfactorily.  But the question of routed netmail is
     such a basic service in a mail network like this that it should be
     clearly stated in Policy that routing netmail is one of the NCs
     required duties.

     Besides, if Policy _doesn't_ require this, who is to say that an NC
     isn't performing his duties?

     Next, a reply to Mr Zorch Frezberg who asked where in P4 it says that
     message content is grounds for excommunication.  The answer to that is
     simple;, nowhere.  P4 hardly mentions EchoMail at all, except for the
     part which was quoted in FidoNews 1337 and which I won't repeat here.
     What P4 _does_ state however is

     "If a node in your network is acting in a sufficiently annoying
     manner, then you can take whatever action you deem fit, according to
     the circumstances of the case."  (Section 4.3)

     In other parts it mentions that echomail cannot be allowed to degrade
     the performance of the network and that bombing runs are considered
     annoying.  But annoying behaviour does not in itself constitute
     grounds for Excessively annoying behaviour.  It is only when such
     annoying behaviour persists that it can be deemed XAB.

     I would also like to point out that I am not primarily talking about
     message _content_, but more specifically of the impact of the messages
     in question.  If a sysop (or user) persists in sending obscene
     material in a family echo despite repeated warnings from the
     moderator, he is excessively annoying.  The same goes for a sysop who
     repeatedly spams several echoes with nonsense messages, or messages
     that is clearly off-topic.  I'm not talking first time offences, but
     offences repeated over a period of time and which persists after they
     have been pointed out to the sysop.

     I want no more than Mr Frezberg a Fidonet where the freedom of speech
     is impaired by a holier-than-thou *C-structure, but what I don't want
     is a Fidonet which disintegrates into a hopeless state of disarray
     much like the UseNet newsgroups are today with spammers and a
     impossibly low S/N-ratio.

     The purpose of this little treatise is to provide introductory
     information for persons who are interested in starting a computer
     bulletin board system or connecting an existing system with FidoNet.
     In this one document you will find an introduction to many different
     aspects of running a bulletin board and information on where to go for
     more information in those cases where the introduction sounds
     interesting.

     This document is distributed under the auspices of IFNA, the
     International FidoNet Association.  IFNA's chief responsibility is the
     maintenance and administration of the network which forms the backbone
     of this collection of diverse bulletin board systems.  Part of this
     job involves orientation of new members of the network.  The growth
     and health of FidoNet speaks well of the ability of the systems and
     the operators of those systems to work together, and you can't work
     together if you don't know the ground rules.

     Introduction to FidoNet
     ------------ -- -------

     The network is a loose coalition of many different bulletin board
     systems.  "FidoNet" and "Fido" are registered trademarks of Tom
     Jennings; a formal agreement allows IFNA to use these in the name of
     the organization.  The network is by no means limited to the Fido
     FIDONEWS 13-38               Page 5                   16 Sep 1996


     software; there are several "FidoNet compatible" systems which
     interface with the network.  By joining, you as a sysop can take
     advantage of the expertise of thousands of other users.

     A short history lesson will help in understanding FidoNet.  Tom
     Jennings was in San Francisco, and John Madill was in Baltimore, both
     working on the Fido BBS software.  In the spirit of finding out if it
     could be done, they decided to add code to the system to support a
     dialup connection with no human intervention during the wee hours when
     the sysops were sleeping and the systems were free.  This quickly
     became a useful function, since both systems and both sysops were busy
     and it was a convenient method of exchanging information.

     From this chance beginning in May 1984, growth was phenomenal.  By
     August 1984, there were 30 nodes; by September there were 50.  By
     February 1985, there were 160 systems, and a group of sysops in St.
     Louis had taken over the administration of the list of systems.  In
     June 1985 the network converted to the currently-used two-part
     addressing scheme to support the growth.  As this is written in late
     1987, the size of the network has passed 2000 nodes and change
     continues with a zone-based nodelist to facilitate communication with
     systems overseas.  But we get ahead of the story . . .

     Network Organization
     ------- ------------

     Today's network is organized into geographical divisions of zones,
     regions, networks, individual systems, and points.  A zone is a very
     large division; zone 1 is North America, zone 2 is Europe, and zone 3
     is Australia, New Zealand, etc.  Of more interest are regions,
     networks, and points.

     North America is divided into regions.  For example, the central
     region, region 11, includes Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan,
     Ohio, and Wisconsin.  Regions are assigned 2-digit numbers to
     differentiate them from networks.

     Regions are further broken down into networks.  A network usually
     covers a rather small geographic area, such as a metropolitan area.
     Chicagoland is network 115.

     Individual systems are assigned a node number within the appropriate
     network or directly within the region if no network covers that
     specific location.

     A point is a usually a one-person BBS.

     There is an analogy with telephone numbers.  Think of the zone as the
     country code, the network as the area code, the node number as the
     telephone number, and the point as an extension for the individual.
     This is written as zone:network/node.point.  For example, Chicago is
     covered by network 115, and is in zone 1.  The specific BBS which has
     been assigned node 100 in the Chicago network would be 1:115/100.  If
     there were point systems served by this BBS, they would be
     1:115/100.1, 1:115/100.2, and so on.

     FIDONEWS 13-38               Page 6                   16 Sep 1996


     The purposes of this organization are twofold.  First,
     decentralization means that no one person has the task of
     administering the entire network.  Since it is a volunteer and amateur
     operation and such an assignment would be a big job, it became obvious
     early in the life of FidoNet that decentralization was necessary to
     support growth of the network.

     The second reason for such a hierarchy is to improve the flow of mail.
     One system in each network takes on the responsibility of Network Co-
     ordinator, and that BBS becomes node zero in the network.  One of the
     tasks of the Network Coordinator is to forward incoming mail.  Thus,
     if I have ten messages for different systems in the Chicagoland
     network, I need to make not ten telephone calls but only one -- to
     system 115/0, which is the NC for Chicagoland.  The mailer software
     automatically routes messages for nodes in network 115 to 115/0,
     saving me money and making the network work better.

     The Nodelist and FidoNews
     --- -------- --- --------

     All of this is held together by two documents, each published weekly.
     One of these is a list of every system in the network, with
     network/node address, telephone number, and other useful information;
     this is called the NODELIST.  The other document is a newsletter,
     FidoNews.  Both the nodelist changes and FidoNews are distributed
     using the network; once your system is up and running you will have a
     source for the most current information.

      What's in it for Me?
     ------ -- -- --- --

     This is all well and good, but other than the thrill of being a part
     of all this exciting technology, what good is FidoNet to the average
     sysop?  Through the magic of echomail, your system can have thousands
     of callers a day, posting messages, asking questions, and receiving
     answers.  This use of the network has eclipsed the original sysop-to-
     sysop communication, although this is still a strong motivation,
     especially when used to exchange data and/or programs.  More about
     echomail later.

     What Must I Do?
     ---- ---- - --

     There are really only two rules to follow to be a part of the network.
     The first is that your BBS system must be "FidoNet compatible" and
     able to receive network messages during one hour each day.  The second
     is that you must not unduly annoy other members of the network, or
     yourself be unduly annoyed.  Like a large family, the members of the
     network must all learn to live together, if not in perfect harmony, at
     least working together.

     A formal policy document exists which states in more detail the
     expectations of systems as members of the network.  It should be
     available from the same source where you found this document; for
     example, as an additional file in the ARC or an additional file in the
     download area where you found this.  Look for POLICYx.ARC.
     FIDONEWS 13-38               Page 7                   16 Sep 1996


     How do I join FidoNet?
     --- -- - ---- -------

     If you live in an area covered by a network, you will normally join
     that net-work; if your geographic area is not covered by a network
     then you can join the region as an independent system.

     The method for becoming a part of the network is described in the
     policy document mentioned above.  It involves actually using your BBS
     to send a message to the network coordinator.  This insures that you
     have a working system, providing an important cross-check on your
     request.  (This became important early in the history of the network
     as wrong numbers crept into the nodelist.  Imagine explaining to
     someone why their telephone rang dozens of times between 3 and 4 AM,
     with no one on the other end when they answered it.)

     Many networks have a document available to prospective members which
     supplements the Policy document and contains local requirements.  The
     best course of action is to find a BBS in your area and quiz the sysop
     on local procedures.  Failing this, find a nodelist (see below) and
     send a message to the General Help node listed in Region 1.

     The Nodelist
     --- --------

     Perhaps the single most-important file on your system is the nodelist.
     From it, your system obtains the information necessary to communicate
     with other systems, be they across the street or in another country.

     The most basic format of nodelist is described by the FidoNet
     Technical Standards Committee (FTSC) and is generally called the "St.
     Louis format" nodelist.  If you find a file named NODELIST.nnn, where
     nnn is a number, that is an FTSC nodelist.  The number is the date
     associated with the nodelist; for example, NODELIST.275 was issued on
     day 275.  Nodelists are often ARC'ed; NODELIST.A75 is the ARC'ed
     version of NODELIST.275.  (No, Virginia, all ARC files don't end with
     .ARC.)  FTSC nodelists (which no longer come from St.  Louis) are
     issued each Friday.

     The FTSC nodelist contains information on every BBS in the network.
     Luckily, it is rare that you will need to transmit or receive an
     entire nodelist.  CHANGES are distributed each week in a file named
     NODEDIFF.nnn.  For example, let's say that you are running with
     NODELIST.267.  When the next nodelist is ready, you will obtain a file
     named NODEDIFF.275.  When you run the XLATLIST program (see below) it
     will automatically apply the changes in the nodediff file, and as if
     by magic you will have NODELIST.275 on your system.

     Here is an excerpt from NODELIST.275 which illustrates the FTSC
     format:

     This is part of the definition of network 115 ("Host,115").  The
     network coordinator is listed first, and becomes node zero in the
     network.  After that, individual nodes are listed.  Notice that
     115/333 is really the same BBS as 115/0.  System 115/123 has been
     marked in the nodelist as "down", which gives other systems notice
     that it is unavailable.

     The FTSC nodelist is the only file which is consistent throughout
     FidoNet.  Virtually all systems process this file into other forms
     before it is actually used by the BBS software.  In the interest of
     attempting to clarify, the current process for MS-DOS will now be
     described.  If your system does not use this method, don't let the
     explanation confuse you -- instead consider it an example of nodelist
     processing.

     For most systems, the next flavor of nodelist is NODELIST.BBS.  This
     one is similar to the FTSC format, but some of the information is
     dropped (name of sysop, for example), and some is customized (for
     example 1-312 in the telephone number could be removed if you are in
     area-code 312).  NODELIST.BBS is created by a program named XLATLIST.
     This program and its documentation are usually found in a file named
     XLATRGEN.ARC.  (Another program in the same ARC file is ROUTEGEN.
     XLATRGEN=XLATlist+RouteGEN.  ROUTEGEN will not be discussed here; if
     you choose to use it read the documentation carefully.)  Input to
     XLATLIST is the FTSC nodelist, optionally a nodediff file containing
     changes for the week, and a control file, XLATLIST.CTL.  The control
     file specifies options like telephone-number customization and how
     much you want to charge your users to send mail to various locations.

     Here is an example of the same segment of the nodelist as it might
     appear in NODELIST.BBS:

     HOST 115 0 2400 Chicagoland 9-799-4790 Homewood_IL
     333 0 2400 Solar_Wind 9-799-4790 Homewood_IL
     500 0 9600 Sit_UBU_Sit_HST 9-982-5092 Skokie_IL
     108 0 2400 Samson 9-394-0071 Arlington_Heights_IL
     640 0 2400 Computer_Guild 9-640-7980 Elk_Grove_IL

     Notice that the sysop name is not included and the format is slightly
     different.  The telephone number has been "customized" based upon the
     XLATLIST.CTL file -- this system needs to prefix local numbers with a
     "9".  The zero after the node number is the cost of calling that
     system; these are free calls for the example system.  The system
     marked "down" in the FTSC nodelist was not included in NODELIST.BBS.

     The last flavor of nodelist is created from NODELIST.BBS by your BBS
     software, and is specific to the system (Opus, SEAdog, etc.).  This
     step is called "compiling" the nodelist. Its exact implementation
     varies with the type of BBS software, but usually there is a program
     similar to XLATLIST which takes NODELIST.BBS as its input and creates
     internal files used by the BBS while it is running.  For example, Opus
     has a program named OPUSNODE.EXE which creates NODELIST.SYS and
     NODELIST.IDX.  During actual execution, Opus uses these files to look
     up information on network addresses.
     FIDONEWS 13-38               Page 9                   16 Sep 1996


     Finally, a real-life example from my system, running Opus with an
     address of 1:115/777.  The current nodelist is NODELIST.268.  On
     Saturday I receive from my network coordinator a file named
     NODEDIFF.A75 which when un-ARC'ed becomes NODEDIFF.275.  Being a
     conscientious sysop who knows that maintaining a current nodelist is
     one of the requirements of FidoNet policy (and also not wanting to
     jangle someones telephone at 0400) I will update the nodelist.  I have
     a file named XLATLIST.CTL which looks like this:

     node 1:115/777
     seadog
     nocomments
     DIAL
          1-312-                             ;
         ;
     END
     cost 0 0
       1-312  0
     end

     This is a simple control file which tells XLATLIST I am node
     1:115/777, that I want a SEAdog-format NODELIST.BBS, that I don't want
     to see the comments in the nodelist, that the text "1-312" should be
     removed from telephone numbers, and that the cost for all calls is
     zero.

     After un-ARCing the NODEDIFF, I execute XLATLIST.EXE.  Its input is
     NODELIST.268, NODEDIFF.275, and XLATLIST.CTL.  Its output is a short
     summary on the screen, NODELIST.275, and NODELIST.BBS.

     Now I execute the command "OPUSNODE -f".  This creates Opus' internal-
     format nodelist files.  And that's it.  Next week, I'll receive a file
     named NODEDIFF.282 and repeat the process.  Very painless, actually.


     Which BBS System is the Best?
     ----- --- ------ -- --- ----

     You will find no answer to that question here, as each sysop has good
     reasons for choosing a particular system.  You must decide for
     yourself, based upon what you observe as a user of the system and what
     you may be able to find out from sysops of that particular type of
     system.  A quick overview of the various types of software available
     will be provided here, and even that is done with fear and trembling,
     since new versions and new products are upon us always.

     There are two distinct components required for a FidoNet BBS:  the
     part that interfaces with the NETWORK (which we'll call the MAILER)
     and the part which interfaces with the USER (which we'll call the
     BBS).  Some products contain both of these functions (Fido, Opus),
     some contain only the BBS portion (TBBS, RBBS), and some contain only
     the mailer function (SEAdog, Dutchie, BinkleyTerm).  This provides the
     flexibility to interface existing BBS products such as TBBS and RBBS
     to the network.

     Specific information on how to obtain the systems is provided at the
     FIDONEWS 13-38               Page 10                  16 Sep 1996


     end of this document.

     Full-Function:  BBS and Mailer
     --------------  --- --- ------

     Fido:  This is where it started.  Fido version 11 is copyrighted
     software which may be used for free if the use meets certain
     conditions (free access and non-commercial are two).  Fido version 12
     is a commercial product with a list price of $175, available to IFNA
     members for $100.  Fido version 12 has several new features, including
     the ability to receive network mail any time and locks/keys for
     message areas.  An echomail conference exists for Fido support.

     Opus:  A more recent entry in the Fido-compatible BBS field is Opus.
     This BBS is copyrighted software which is free to users who observe
     the restrictions of the license, and from the caller's perspective
     behaves much the same as Fido; this makes the conversion from Fido to
     Opus easy for the caller.  For the sysop, the conversion is also easy
     as Opus supports the user list, file areas, and messages from Fido.
     However, from the sysop perspective, Opus is significantly different
     from Fido, more flexible, and supports 24-hour mail.  Several echomail
     conferences exist devoted to Opus support.

     BBS-function (User Interface) Only
     ------------ ----- ---------- ----

     TBBS: In the opinion of many, this system is the premier BBS.  It
     costs $299.95, plus $99.95 for SEAdog to handle network mail.  (Note:
     Because of the method used to package the extension to TBBS for
     network operation, it is not possible to order SEAdog through IFNA and
     TBBS from the vendor.  The TBBS mail processors and SEAdog are bundled
     together.)  TBBS is a very flexible system from the sysop perspective
     and very easy to use for callers.  TBBS will even support a multi-line
     and online chat option if you want to get fancy.  An echomail
     conference exists for TBBS sysops.

     QBBS:  A shareware clone of TBBS, this BBS combines much of the
     flexibility of TBBS with the economy of a shareware product ($25
     registration).  It requires a mailer front end to interface with the
     network; BinkleyTerm works nicely for this purpose.  It can use
     outboard echomail processing (e.g. ConfMail) or integral echomail
     utilities.  A QBBS echomail conference exists.

     RBBS:  A recent entry in the FidoNet arena by virtue of interfacing an
     existing BBS how to a mailer.  RBBS uses a separate mailer system to
     interface with FidoNet and a program written by Bob Westcott (132/114)
     to convert netmail-style messages into the RBBS message base.  RBBS is
     public domain, available from most sysops which run it.

     PCBoard:  There is now a Door written by Peter Vernaglia (101/149)
     that lets PCBoard V11 or V12 be FidoNet compatible by using SEAdog or
     BinkleyTerm.  PCBoard is a commercial BBS that must be purchased from
     the author, Fred Clark.  The version that supports Doors costs $120.
     PCBoard's main features are that any file can be downloaded from the
     main menu, it can be networked to support multiple phone lines and is
     very easy to set up and maintain.

     Mail-function (Network Interface) Only
     ------------- -------- ---------- ----

     There are two options when using a separate mailer system.  The mailer
     can answer the phone and, if it detects a human caller, load the BBS.
     Or the mailer can be run only during specific time periods, such as
     during National Mail Hour, to send and receive network messages.  With
     the first option, the system is able to receive network mail at any
     time, but callers are slightly inconvenienced by waiting for the BBS
     to load.  With the second, network interface is limited to the
     specific time period.  The best choice for an individual system
     depends upon whether it is primarily human-caller oriented or
     primarily FidoNet-mail oriented.

     SEAdog:  SEAdog began its life as a commercial mail system for
     standalone use.  It became popular in FidoNet as an improved mail
     processor for Fido version 11.  SEAdog is a commercial product of
     System Enhancement Associates, costing $100; it is available to
     members of IFNA for $60.  A SEAdog echomail conference exists to
     provide support for those who obtain the product thru the IFNA offer.

     DUTCHIE:  Dutchie began its life in FidoNet as the first system
     designed specifically to operate as a point, but has since grown to a
     full FidoNet mail system similar to SEAdog, but with a more amateur
     user oriented interface and setup.  Unlike SEAdog, Dutchie is free to
     non-commercial users.

     BinkleyTerm:  This package can be used as a mailer for a BBS, as a
     terminal program, or to support a point system.  It is copyrighted
     code, distributed with source code with no charge for use in
     noncommercial applications.  The authors request recognition for their
     work, which may take the form of a simple "thank you", a post card, or
     best of all, helpful hints on special applications or new utilities.
     A BinkleyTerm echomail conference exists for support questions.

     EchoMail:  What is it?
     --------   ---- -- --

     For many sysops, echomail is the primary reason to hook up to FidoNet.
     It provides the opportunity to share information with large numbers of
     callers on other BBS's which may be in other parts of the world.  This
     is a particularly important advantage for those BBS's which do not
     have large numbers of local callers, or for those subjects in which
     the interest level on any particular BBS is low.

     The concept of echomail operation is simple.  A group of systems
     decides to form a conference on some topic.  Each of them sets aside a
     message area on the local BBS.  Then any message posted on one board
     is automatically echoed to all the other systems.  Functionally, it is
     as if all the participants were dialing into the same local BBS.

     This concept was invented in late 1985 by Jeff Rush, a sysop in
     Dallas.  Growth since then has been phenomenal, with network volume
     associated with echomail eclipsing person-to-person volume.
     Conferences exist today on hundreds of topics with more being started
     every week.  Computer/technical topics are covered (programming,
     FIDONEWS 13-38               Page 12                  16 Sep 1996


     general-technical, mainframe) as well as non-computer topics (debate,
     Bible, music, disABLED, humor), providing every sysop with a wide
     variety of interesting conferences, even in subject areas that have
     limited local expertise.

     The advantages of echomail are obvious, but it has a few
     disadvantages.  In most cases, the sysop pays telephone charges to
     obtain echomail; the routing discussed above is not used for echomail
     because of the volume involved.  Connecting to other systems to obtain
     the conferences can be a headache, depending upon how well the local
     network has organized echomail.  There are delays in response which
     take some getting used to, and there can be "too much of a good thing"
     with active conferences averaging in excess of 100 messages a day.
     Like anything, echomail is best taken in moderation, and the sysop
     must use good judgement.  For example, an attempt to maintain 50
     echomail conferences with a 10-meg hard drive is doomed to failure.

     Operation of EchoMail
     --------- -- --------

     Various echomail utilities are used to move the messages between the
     mail area and the message area.  The words used to describe the
     operation of these utilities are different with the different BBS
     software, but the same functions are performed in all cases.  A
     summary of processing using several popular packages is provided after
     the "generic" explanation.

     Several fields within the message are used to control this process.
     Some of these fields may be invisible, depending upon the type of
     software and parameters specified when it was installed.

     There are two basic functions required to support echomail.  Messages
     posted by local users must be sent to all the other systems
     participating in the conference; we'll call that EXPORT here.
     Messages arriving from other systems must be placed where the users
     can see them; we'll call that IMPORT here.  The import/export process
     is controlled by information within the message itself, and the
     utilities use a control file named AREAS.BBS or ECHO.CTL.

     The first line of each echomail message, when it is sent through the
     network, is AREA:something.  The "something" is what determines into
     which area the message will be placed.  A file named AREAS.BBS or
     ECHO.CTL controls the correspondence between this field and the BBS
     area; in other words, AREA:MAINFRAME might correspond to area 12 on
     your BBS and area 3 on mine.

     Near the end of each message is a SEEN-BY line.  This is the control
     field which is used to determine which system(s) have not yet seen the
     message.  Again, AREAS.BBS or ECHO.CTL lists which systems see
     messages, based upon the AREA:something.

     The last piece of control information in the message is the Origin
     line, near the end of the message, which is placed there during the
     export process.  This is primarily for us humans to know from which
     system the message originated; it is not used in routine operation of
     the echomail utilities.
     FIDONEWS 13-38               Page 13                  16 Sep 1996


     A few examples may make this easier to understand.  The syntax of the
     ConfMail product is used in the examples, but consider them generic to
     the echomail process, rather than specific to one product.

     Assume that the following line exists in AREAS.BBS:

     c:\msg\mframe MAINFRAME 115/123 115/234

     which defines the message area corresponding to the conference with
     AREA:MAINFRAME to be subdirectory c:\msg\mframe, and defines systems
     115/123 and 115/234 as recipients of this conference.  Also assume
     that this is system 115/777.

     Example 1:
     A user on this board (115/777) posts a new message in the area.

     The export process will find no SEEN-BY line at the end of the
     message.  It will add a SEEN-BY line to the existing message which
     reads SEEN-BY 115/123 234 777 It will also add an Origin line to the
     existing message.  Then that message will be sent to systems 115/123
     and 115/234.

     Example 2:
     A incoming netmail message has as its first line AREA:MAINFRAME, and
     it's SEEN-BY line lists 115/123 and 115/777.

     IMPORT moves the message into the MAINFRAME message subdirectory,
     c:\msg\mframe.  The first line, AREA:MAINFRAME, is removed.

     When EXPORT runs, it compares the SEEN-BY line with AREAS.BBS and
     discovers that the message has not been seen by 115/234.  A copy is
     sent to 115/234 via netmail.  (The copy sent to 115/234 will have
     AREA:MAINFRAME as its first line.)  The SEEN-BY line in the message in
     the local area is also updated to indicate that the message has been
     sent to 115/234.

     Echomail Terms
     -------- -----

     One thing that makes echomail difficult for many people is that each
     echomail processor uses different words to describe the same thing.
     The discussion above used the vocabulary of Bob Hartman's popular
     ConfMail system.  Messages are IMPORTED from the netmail area into the
     actual conference, and EXPORTED from the conference to the netmail
     area.  Other products are available to process echomail:  Jeff Rush's
     original utilities, Opus, TBBS, and MGM.

     ARCMAIL is a utility normally used in connection with echomail
     processing, although its application is not limited to echomail.
     Early in the life of echomail, it became obvious that thousands of
     messages sent as normal network mail were causing problems.  To
     address this problem, Thom Henderson at SEA provided the ARCMAIL
     utility.  ARCMAIL searches through the netmail area and finds all
     messages which are to be sent to a system and packs all these
     messages into one ARC file.  It then deletes these messages from the
     netmail area and creates one message to that system, with the ARC file
     FIDONEWS 13-38               Page 14                  16 Sep 1996


     attached.  This saves significant connect time for the systems
     involved, and provides the side benefit that a point-to-point routing
     will be used since the message has a file attached.  Of course,
     ARCMAIL also provides the function of expanding the ARC file into
     netmail messages at the receiving system; if you receive a funny-
     looking file attached to a null message, chances are it is an ARCmail
     file.  ConfMail has the ARCmail function integrated; in other systems
     it is a separate step.

     The original Jeff Rush echomail utilities used the terms TOSS and SCAN
     --messages were TOSSED from netmail into the conference, and the
     conferences were SCANNED, creating the outgoing messages in the
     netmail area.

     Opus uses the Jeff Rush terms -- scanning and tossing can be done
     automatically by the Opus system, or an external processor like
     ConfMail can be used.  There are restrictions on what Opus' internal
     scan/toss mechanism can handle, but these restrictions will not affect
     the casual sysop -- only the active echomail hub.

     MGM also uses the Jeff Rush terms.  Its operation is similar to the
     original echomail utilities.  Incoming messages are unARC'ed using
     ARCMAIL and tossed (from the netmail area to the actual conference
     area) using MGM TOSS.  MGM SCAN is similar to the original scan
     function, in that it moves messages from the actual conference to the
     netmail area.  However, once in the netmail area, all messages are
     addressed to your own system.  An additional step, MGMFWD, is required
     to address the outgoing messages to their actual destination.
     Finally, ARCMAIL is normally used to pack the outgoing messages.

      TBBS has an interesting situation, since it uses SEAdog to interface
     with FidoNet.  TBBS maintains all message subboards in one DOS file,
     as opposed to the Fido method of one message per DOS file which is
     used by SEAdog.  Thus, there is a utility named PREMAIL which searches
     the TBBS message file for messages which need to be sent out and
     converts them to messages in the SEAdog netmail area.  There is a
     similar utility named POSTMAIL which pulls the messages back into the
     TBBS file from SEAdog's area.  The ECHOLINK utility establishes reply
     chains within the TBBS message base and also checks for duplicate
     messages.  Finally, if there is a need to forward to additional
     systems, the ECHOFWD utility handles that chore.


     Routing of Echomail
     ------- -- --------

     It is not unusual for a moderately-sized echomail hub to handle dozens
     of conferences and thousands of messages a day.  This volume would
     quickly swamp the structure which was set up to handle person-to-
     person communication in which mail flows into a network through the
     network coordinator.  For this reason, separate structures have been
     established to expedite the movement of echomail conferences.
     Echomail coordinators have the responsibility to administer this
     activity.  In some cases, the same individual handles both the job of
     a network or region coordinator and echomail coordinator; many times
     these different jobs are performed by different individuals.
     FIDONEWS 13-38               Page 15                  16 Sep 1996


     There are entire systems dedicated to the movement of echomail.  These
     "echomail backbones" serve as repositories for large numbers of
     conferences and links to the next level down on the hierarchy.

     The actual topology of echomail is unimportant.  The point is simple -
     - do not route echomail through normal channels!  Send a few hundred
     echomail messages to some network coordinator and find out the real
     meaning of "annoying behavior".

     To get started in echomail, first get a working BBS.  Get into the
     network, and get settled.  Then talk with your network coordinator, or
     perhaps by then you will have found out who the echomail coordinator
     is.  Regional echomail coordinators are listed in Region 1 of the
     nodelist, with the help nodes.  You should start by receiving a small
     number of conferences from another node and you will route your
     traffic (that is, messages your users enter) back to that node. As
     your knowledge and confidence grows, you can ask for more conferences.

     Echomail Etiquette
     -------- ---------

     There are a few simple things you can do to make echomail more
     pleasant for everyone.  These are common-sense issues but they may not
     be immediately obvious when you are just getting started with
     echomail.

     Do not send person-to-person messages using echomail.  If you have a
     message for Joe Klutz, and no one else is interested in it, then use
     standard netmail.  Even if you mark the message private, every sysop
     in the conference will pay to receive it!  A message between two
     sysops across town in New York, received on a BBS in California, isn't
     likely to win any friends.

     Every conference has a subject; don't get too far off of it.  Most
     conferences have a moderator who will step in and shout if the topic
     strays too much.  Unless you have been involved in a conference and
     have a good grasp of its scope, be cautious about starting a new
     topic.

      When you reply to a message in echomail, mention enough of the
     previous message so that readers can tell what you are replying to.
     It is maddening to see someone discussing the merits of a previous
     message when you can't figure out what the previous message is about.
     Remember, reply chains in echomail are imperfect at best and some
     echomail processors don't even attempt to reconstruct reply chains.

     Also, remember the delay inherent in echomail.  If you post a
     question, don't expect a response tomorrow.  If you reply to a
     question, realize that many others may be replying at the same time, a
     flood which will pour in over the next several days.

     Flames
     ------

     The term "flame" is used within FidoNet to describe a "hot" message
     which disagrees violently with some issue.  Unfortunately, flames
     FIDONEWS 13-38               Page 16                  16 Sep 1996


     often are attacks on persons, not ideas.  This can be very annoying,
     using the term in its "technical" context from FidoNet policy.

     There is no excuse within FidoNet for personal attacks by one
     individual upon another individual, yet it happens all the time.  When
     you compose a message, remember that the electronic media does not
     convey facial expressions or voice tones.  This can make it very
     difficult to convey the real meaning of what you are trying to say.

     Flames are contagious.  If you see an attack on something you believe
     in, or on someone you like, it is human nature to want to answer the
     challenge.  Instead, think about whether you really should reply.  If
     you violently disagree with what you just read, a reply may not be the
     best idea. . . at least not until you have had time to calm down.  It
     is bad form (although altogether too common) to spend more time in the
     reply discussing personalities than the real issues.  Calm reasoning
     will win over more support than calling your opponent names. Remember,
     it's not the COMPUTER you are jousting with; there is a real human
     being out there, with feelings.  Sure, the modem does a great job of
     insulating you, but don't say anything in an electronic message which
     you would not say face-to-face.

     On the other hand, if someone attacks YOUR ideas, don't take it
     personally.  Humor is often the best response to a flame.  Remember,
     everyone has a right to their opinion, and the lack of verbal queues
     in echomail makes disagreement sound like attack.  It is not necessary
     to respond to each and every message which states an opinion different
     from your own.  There are times when ignoring a message is the right
     thing to do, even though it is much more difficult than replying to
     it.


     An Alternative for EchoMail Junkies
     -- ----------- --- -------- -------

     Are you the type of person who is addicted to echomail?  You call up
     your local BBS and spend hours online reading all the messages in
     twenty different conferences?  Perhaps the major reason you're even
     considering opening a BBS is to have your own local source for
     echomail, where you can sit in front of your own computer, and read
     without worrying about tying up a telephone line.

     Welcome to the world of POINTS and SERVERS.  There is an alternative
     to much of the hassle which you've just read about -- instead of
     starting a full-service BBS, become a POINT instead.  Here's the way
     it works.

      A POINT system operates as an adjunct to another system which is a
     traditional nodelisted FidoNet system, the SERVER.  The POINT system
     is much like a one-person BBS.  The point system dials the server at
     some pre-arranged time, usually in the wee hours, and downloads
     echomail.  Then the owner of the point can read it, enter replies, and
     upload this information at the next call.

     This has many advantages for all concerned.  (1) The point system
     doesn't tie up the server BBS for hours reading messages online in the
     FIDONEWS 13-38               Page 17                  16 Sep 1996


     traditional way.  (2) The owner of the point may save lots of money in
     telephone charges if there is a connect-time charge involved in the
     call.  (3) The point owner doesn't have to worry about busy signals,
     and can peruse the messages at any convenient time.  (4) If the point
     owner types slowly, this is even more of an advantage.  (5) The point
     system isn't listed in the nodelist, but can still participate in
     network mail.  With growth of the nodelist, this is a serious
     consideration.  (6) Compared to setting up a full-service BBS, setting
     up a point is easier.

     The disadvantage of being a point is that you must have a server.
     This is becoming less of a problem with the development of
     point/server software.  If you routinely tie up a popular system for
     hours reading mail, the sysop will likely be more than happy to
     provide you with point access, since it will make the BBS more
     available for other callers.  If you fall into the category of
     "echomail junkie", consider discussing point/server with your favorite
     sysop; it may be what you really want to do rather than open a full-
     service BBS.

     There are several alternatives available now for point/server
     software, and the capabilities of the software are growing by the day.
     DUTCHIE was the first package, and introduced the concept.  Other
     alternatives include ConfMail, MGM, and BinkleyTerm.  Obviously the
     point must use a system which is compatible with the server.

     Common "Gotcha's"
     ------ ----------

     Here's a collection of little tips that may save you from having to
     ask your fellow sysop when something looks bad. . . or keep your
     system running more smoothly.

     You'll have an interesting problem once a year with XLATLIST.  It
     "knows" that the most current changes to the nodelist are in a file
     named NODEDIFF.nnn where nnn is the largest.  What happens at the
     first of a new year?  Guess what -- it's not true, once a year, that
     the most current nodediff file has the "highest" name.  So watch for
     this; it can keep your nodelist update from working correctly in early
     January.  The solution is simple:  Rename the old nodelist (the one
     you want the nodediff applied to) to NODELIST.000, and make sure that
     there aren't any other NODELIST.nnn files present in the
     subdirectory.

     A similar problem exists with Daylight Savings Time.  FidoNet does not
     observe daylight savings time.  If your area does, then the LOCAL time
     for your National Mail Hour changes twice a year -- once in the spring
     when DST begins, and once in the fall when it ends.  When you change
     the time on your computer (using the TIME command), remember to also
     change the time for your mail events in whatever mailer program you
     are using.  If you don't change both at the same time, you'll be
     observing National Mail Hour during the wrong hour.

     Many new FidoNet sysops find out the hard way that messages which have
     files attached do not follow normal routing.  No matter which BBS
     software you are using, if a message has a file attached it will be
     FIDONEWS 13-38               Page 18                  16 Sep 1996


     sent direct to its destination, and no routing that you request will
     affect it.  This can come as a shock to the new sysop who thinks that
     all the outgoing messages are routed to another local system; attach a
     file to a message and your system will gladly call Australia if you
     let it.

     This document is a group effort.  It has to be; no one person can know
     every piece of software which is in common use in the network.  When
     you run a particular type of BBS software, you become familiar with
     that piece of software and the utilities that it uses; that doesn't
     help the potential sysop who isn't using your configuration.

     So, readers, if you have made your way through the implementation of
     something which is not covered here, and you want to share your
     experience with your fellow users, please write something and send it
     to me.  I would be happy for this document to grow so that more topics
     are covered.  To corrupt a popular phrase. . . send prose!

     Six Mail Processors Reviewed [V]
     Damian Walker, 2:2502/666

     Last week's article was about IMail, the 386 echomail processor by
     Andreas Klein.  In this, the penultimate article of this review
     series, I will move on to JMail by PROZ Software.  Next week's article
     will include a full feature table for all six mail processors.

     JMAIL

         JMail 2.80 is the creation of Jason Steck of 1:285/424.  It is a
     shareware product, costing $15.  The evaluation period is 30 days,
     after this period there will be delays during the program's execution
     to remind you that your registration is overdue.
         This evaluation version is dated 2/95.  Although I do not know
     what later versions are available, I have seen messages from Jason in
     the NET_DEV echo with tear lines mentioning version 2.81.  Whether
     this version has been released or not, I have no idea.

     First Impressions

         I first heard of JMail last year some time when, in a local
     conference, someone was asking about mail processors which processed
     large messages.  Without even looking at the package, this will make
     JMail a good choice for many sysops, since it is one of a very few
     programs which claims to handle messages of any size.
         The advantages of unlimited size messages are apparent after only
     a few moments thought.  For anyone reading gated Usenet newsgroups,
     the size limits imposed by most mail processors will cause missing or
     truncated messages; this is especially apparent with autoposted tables
     and informational bulletins-- just the sort of thing you _don't_ want
     to see truncated.  If the gating software allows large messages, a
     sysop using JMail will not have this problem.
         Upon unpacking the archive, the first surprise I got was that
     there is no full-screen setup program.  I should have expected that
     some programs of this type would be configured using text files, but
     my experience of mail processors before I started on this series was
     limited to only a few packages (all with setup programs).  Although I
     have nothing against text file configuration myself, it did take the
     fun out of browsing around the package's setup :-)

     On Further Examination...

         In the absence of a full screen set-up program, I settled down
     with a cup of tea and JMail's documentation.  At 48 pages it isn't too
     big; in fact it's surprisingly small considering the fact that text
     files are used to configure the program.  You'd expect software using
     this configuration method to need a lot in the way of examples and
     explanation.
         However, part of the manual's reduced size is explained by the
     sample configuration files.  Like many packages configured using text
     FIDONEWS 13-38               Page 24                  16 Sep 1996


     files, the sample configuration files contain extensive commenting.
     Each option keyword is provided with information and examples in the
     setup file itself.
         This is handier than having to constantly switch between the
     configuration file and the manual, as the information you need is in
     the file you are editing.  The manual is needed only to get more
     information about a particular keyword.
         For those of you who are in doubt about the merits of
     configuration using normal ASCII text files, ponder for a moment upon
     the seemingly unrelated subject of batch files, especially in such
     improved command shells as 4DOS.  Because the configuration and area
     files are plain text, they can easily be modified by batch files
     automatically.  If you're not scared of batch file editing, or even
     writing little 'quick & dirty' programs in QBASIC or C, the
     possibilities of automation quickly become apparent when you look at
     JMail's system of keywords (or that of any text-file configured
     software).
         Now that I have dwelt excessively upon JMail's method of
     configuration, let's move on and look at some other aspects of the
     package.
         JMail boasts the best support for message bases of any package
     reviewed here, although this support is implemented in an unusual way.
     JMail supports the Hudson, *.MSG, JAM, Squish and GoldBase message
     bases (it's the only program reviewed to cover GoldBase).  However,
     each of these message base types (with the exception of *.MSG)
     requires a different installation of JMail.  There are separate
     distribution archives for Hudson, JAM, Squish and GoldBase message
     bases, although each of the JMail versions also supports *.MSG and
     pass-thru areas.
         As I could only find the Hudson version locally, I was unable to
     investigate the practicalities of using multiple JMail installations
     in a setup where multiple message base types are used side by side.
     This also dictated that the only speed tests given for JMail are
     Hudson and *.MSG.
         The manual specifies that you need an existing message base to
     start using JMail, and this is indeed the case.  Usually, you will
     have created your message base using your BBS software, but in the
     case of points, mail-only nodes, and me doing this review, this is not
     the case.  Luckily, I had to hand 4 other mail processors which are
     capable of creating a Hudson message base :-)  It is a minor niggle,
     but bear it in mind if you are planning to use JMail with a BBS-less
     system.
         JMail provides an elementary AreaFix feature, which can be
     addressed using any name the sysop chooses; this allows JMail to be
     used for systems with downlinks, without the aid of an external
     AreaFix program.
         Oddly, JMail appears not to have a message base maintenance
     feature included.
         Users who count speed as a very high priority will probably not
     wish to use JMail, unless they also need unlimited size messages. The
     speed test used for JMail is the same as for the other software, that
     is, a 91-message 50k package, imported into a newly-created Hudson
     base and empty *.MSG areas.
         Strangely, JMail came up with the same timings for Hudson and
     *.MSG areas-- 34 seconds.  This may or may not be a direct consequence
     of the special algorithm required for processing unlimited length
     FIDONEWS 13-38               Page 25                  16 Sep 1996


     messages, since JMail does not achieve this by simply using a large
     buffer in memory (messages would be limited by available memory if
     this was the case).
         One feature which seems to be posessed by JMail alone (among the
     packages reviewed) is the twit filter.  Although not going under that
     name, the no-import feature which can be used to exclude messages from
     certain people is the closest thing I've seen to the twit filter
     feature of many point systems.

     Summary

         JMail is most suitable for systems where its principal advantage
     is a priority-- the ability to process messages of unlimited size.
     Systems which gate Usenet newsgroups are obvious candidates which
     spring to mind.
         It is seemingly oriented towards BBS's rather than mail-only
     systems.  This is suggested by the lack of two essential features
     which are often performed by BBS software rather than the mail
     processor-- the initial creation of a message base, and message base
     maintenance tools such as purge and pack.
         When comparing JMail to the other software on test, bear in mind
     that it costs only $15 to register.  If JMail contains all the
     features that you want, this more than offsets its simplicity compared
     to some other mail processors.
         Next week brings the final article in this review series.  I will
     be looking at Squish, a package for those using the Squish message
     base (surprisingly enough).  That final article will also contain a
     feature table to help you decide which package best suits your needs.
     Squish does, however, have its own message base maintenance utility.

     Hello all.

     This is a follow up to my message of July 6, 1996.  Here is a summary
     of the files in the ZSEGS area from 7/10/96 to 9/11/96 (9 weeks):

         Zone 1:  9 diff's
         Zone 2:  1 segment, 8 diff's
         Zone 3:    (none)
         Zone 4:  10 segments
         Zone 5:  3 segments
         Zone 6:  2 segments

     Based on the above, this is how I rate the ZC's in the performance of
     their single most important duty:

         Zone 1:  C    Diff's are useless if even one is missed.
         Zone 2:  C+   Diff's are useless if even one is missed.
         Zone 3:  F    What can I say?  Will Zone 3 die like the FTSC did?

     Write in C (to the tune of the Beatles' "Let it Be")

     When I find my code in tons of trouble,
     Friends and colleagues come to me,
     Speaking words of wisdom:
     "Write in C."

     As the deadline fast approaches,
     And bugs are all that I can see,
     Somewhere, someone whispers:
     "Write in C."

     Write in C, Write in C,
     Write in C, oh, Write in C.
     LOGO's dead and buried,
     Write in C.

     I used to write a lot of FORTRAN,
     For science it worked flawlessly.
     Try using it for graphics!
     Write in C.

     If you've just spent nearly 30 hours
     Debugging some assembly,
     Soon you will be glad to
     Write in C.

     Write in C, Write in C,
     Write in C, yeah, Write in C.
     Only wimps use BASIC.
     Write in C.

     Write in C, Write in C
     Write in C, oh, Write in C.
     Pascal won't quite cut it.
     Write in C.

     Write in C, Write in C,
     Write in C, yeah, Write in C.
     Don't even mention COBOL.
     Write in C.

                           QUESTION OF THE WEEK
     =================================================================


     Many years ago, a previous Editor toyed with the idea of adding
     pictures to weekly Issues of FidoNews. The pictures weren't embedded
     in the Issue directly. They were noted in the text and added as
     separate files within the FidoNews archive for that week.

     The Question of the Week is:

     Would you like to see picture files in the FidoNews? If so, what
     format is most universally accessible across platforms? Should there
     be a size limit on picture files?

     As always, send in your answers as Netmail, email, Echomail in the
     FIDONEWS Echo [Z1 Backbone and others], or as an .ART file for
     publication. See Masthead for mail details.

     Thanks.

     Latest Greatest Software Versions
     by Peter E. Popovich, 1:363/264

     I'm glad to say, I'm moderately up-to-date. My inbound is pretty much
     caught up. I gained a new skill in the process: I can now type "My
     apologies for the delay. It's been a mahdouse over here." from muscle
     memory... ;-)

     In an effort to avoid confusion at this point, I'll point out that I
     crash mail to Zone 1 and tothe Zonegates. I do not crash overseas. If
     you're outside Zone 1 and you've sent in info that isn't listed
     below, chances are there's mail on the way to you asking for a
     clarification.

     Phased out this week: DMG 2.93.

     Phase-out highlights:
       This week: Genesis Deluxe 3.2 Deadline for info: 26 Sep 1996.
       Last week: DreamBBS 1.05 Deadline for info: 19 Sep 1996.

     Anyone interested in getting a copy of the INTERNET GATEWAY FAQ may
     file-request GISFAQ.ZIP from 1:133/411.0, or send an internet message
     to fidofaq@gisatl.fidonet.org.  No message or text or subject is
     necessary.  The address is a keyword that will trigger the automated
     response.  People wishing to send inquiries directly to David Deitch
     should now mail to fidonet@gisatl.fidonet.org rather than the
     previously listed address.
