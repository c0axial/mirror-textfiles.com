                                    IFNA
                         1986 Results/1987 Forecast


          IFNA as  a Corporation  is now  seven months  old,  multinet
     FidoNet will be two years old in June, and FidoNet itself is over
     three years  old.   The fact  that we have survived this long and
     that the nodelist keeps getting larger is an accomplishment to be
     proud of.   The growth pains have come and gone and very few have
     left. The  work and  associated expenses  to hold it all together
     keeps rising.

          IFNA to date has managed to establish some pretty firm roots
     to keep  things running  smooth well into the 80's.  A portion of
     IFNA's track record currently includes:

     * The establishment of the Region 1 HELP nodes and appointment of
       all the Regional Coordinators in the USA.

     * The planning and implementation  of  the  Silicon  Valley  IFNA
       Conference in Colorado Springs in cooperation with COSUG.

     * The creation of the IFNA Echomail Conference.

     * The  appointment  of Bob Hartman as Chairman of the IFNA Bylaws
       Committee as well as the hiring of  Aselage  Kiefer  &  Co.  to
       audit the Bylaws election.

     * Funding  the International Technical Coordinator's data line to
       help offset the expense of holding  the  international  FidoNet
       Network together.

     * The  appointment  of  Randy  Bush  as  Chairman  of the FidoNet
       Technical Standards Committee and recent replacement by  Ryugen
       Fisher.

     * The  appointment  of  Bob  Morris  as Chairman of the Elections
       Committee.

     * The IFNA Public Relations work resulting in articles in most of
       the major PC trade rags which in turn stimulated  2500  letters
       of  inquiry  sent to the PO Box leading to the continued growth
       of the Net.

     * The creation of the IFNA foldover Pamphlet which is  mailed  in
       response  to  most  of  the correspondence along with a current
       copy of Region 1 and all the network and region coordinators.

     * The  appointment  of  Ben  Baker  as  International   Technical
       Coordinator  1/0,  Henk Wever as Europe Coordinator 2/0,  Brian
       Gatenby as Australia's Coordinator 3/0,  and Thom Henderson  as
       FidoNews Editor 1/1.
     Fidonews                     Page 3                   27 Apr 1987


     * The  distribution  of the FidoNet Technical Standards Documents
       to  most  of  the  major  BBS  vendors  to  stimulate   further
       development  utilizing  the  FidoNet  Protocol  as a "store and
       forward" Email Standard.

     * Funding the legal and accounting  fees  required  to  obtain  a
       general not-for-profit 501c3 status.

     * Making  the  initial  contacts  and  spearheading  the  testing
       efforts that eventually led to the USR Courier Special  pricing
       for all SYSOPs.

     * Coordinating and handling the Special Offer for SEAdog for IFNA
       members.

     * Preparing  and  filing IFNA Corporate income tax.  IFNA did not
       owe money for 1986,  but the paperwork still had to be prepared
       for Aselage, Kiefer & Co.


          The  IFNA financials for 1986 are made up of two parts,  the
     first three quarters of 1986 prior to incorporation and  the  4th
     quarter after incorporation.  All monies received prior to incor-
     poration  were treated as personal contributions and then member-
     ships were introduced in Q4.  Income taxes have been paid on  the
     personal contributions segment.


              Tax Year 1986 Revenues
              ======================
              Contributions           $3,500
              Membership Fees          1,600
                                      ------
                                      $5,100

              Tax Year 1986 Expenses
              ======================
              Telephone               $  980
              Computer Paper              75
              Ribbons & Diskettes        211
              Reproduction               189
              Bank Charges                80
              Postage and Envelopes      162
              Business Cards             107
              License Fees                35
              Legal Fees                 750
              PO Box Fee                  44
                                      ------
                                      $2,633


          The current  forecast as  projected in the 501c3 application
     are to  double both revenues and expenses.  We have intentionally
     held expenses  down until  a  permanent  Board  of  Directors  is
     elected   from   among   the   current   IFNA   membership.   The
     Administration and Finance Committee should be one of  the  first
     Fidonews                     Page 4                   27 Apr 1987


     Committees staffed after the BOD is in place.  IFNA currently has
     approximately  $5000  in the bank and thus we were able to sign a
     contract with the Radisson Mark Plaza Hotel in Alexandria, Va. to
     lock in the dates of August  20th  to  23rd  for  the  next  IFNA
     Conference  without the need of third party financing.  Last year
     we had to have COSUG in order to pull the Conference off.

          IFNA has  already been  made aware of a number of worthwhile
     projects that  should be  considered for funding in 1987.  One is
     to assist the efforts of Bob Hartman in attempting to determine a
     9600 baud modem standard  for  use  on  FidoNet.  Another  is  to
     assist  Tim Pozar in his redesign efforts for a permanent UUCP to
     FidoNet Gateway.  Another suggestion was to provide  some  public
     relations  financial  assistance  to the hosts of a number of the
     better Echomail Conferences.  We would like to hear your  sugges-
     tions  and ideas for funding projects which would help to improve
     FidoNet.

          Your interim  Board of  Directors thank all of you that have
     provided support  and money  to help get IFNA off the ground.  We
     also thank  all of  the "flamers" that have done such a marvelous
     job of keeping IFNA on the forefront of FidoNet.  Looking forward
     to seeing everyone in DC this August.

                          OLD SYSOPS NEVER DIE...
                        THEIR SOULS JUST ROT IN HELL


     I am a new FIDO sysop.  My logic tells me that,  because I  am  a
     newcomer to the FIDO scene (and fairly naive), I will probably be
     told  that  I don't know what I am talking about and best to keep
     my opinions to myself until I am better informed. However, I have
     never been one to trust my instincts, so here goes...

     I don't think FIDO utilities should be distributed  independently
     under  the  "user  supported" concept.  Let me try to explain.  I
     became a  FIDO  sysop  and  joined  the  network  (and  IFNA)  in
     November,  1986.  At  that  time  I was running a 'vanilla' FIDO.
     Well,  it didn't take me very long  to  realize  that  a  lot  of
     independently  written  FIDO  utilities  were available that,  if
     incorporated into my system, would make my life as a FIDO sysop a
     whole lot easier.  So,  I started adding various utilities to  my
     RUNBBS.BAT file as need dictated.  By the first of the year I had
     close to 20 utilities augmenting my board as I had originally set
     it up. Each of these utilities is distributed under the shareware
     concept and I am expected to pay for their continued use. Some of
     the  authors  of  these  utilities  use the 'soft-sell' approach.
     Like gentle reminders that my soul will rot in hades if  I  don't
     pay  up.  Others  are downright belligerent,  like programming my
     bulletin board to send FIDONET messages  to  the  utility  author
     every  night  allowing  him  to  keep track of each of those FIDO
     sysops he is going to sue  for  copyright  infringement  (I  have
     often wondered who is suffering the most from this approach,  the
     local sysop,  or the utility author who is blessed with all these
     messages accumulating in his FIDONET message area).

     I don't mind paying for those utilities that are useful to me.  I
     guess what is bothering me is the  inefficiency  in  the  present
     method  of  paying  for these utilities.  I am expected to make a
     separate payment to each utility author for every FIDO utility  I
     choose to incorporate into my system.  It seems to me there ought
     to be a better way.  Why not commission  IFNA  to  serve  as  the
     distribution  center  for  independently  written FIDO utilities?
     When a sysop decides to begin utilizing a particular utility,  he
     could  be  instructed  to  send  the requested shareware 'fee' to
     IFNA,  with an indication of the utility he is paying  for.  IFNA
     could send payments to the appropriate authors on a quarterly, or
     semi-annual  basis,  and  recoup  a small profit for the service.
     Thus,  if I am adding five new utilities to my system,  I am  not
     inconvenienced  by  the requirement that I send 5 separate checks
     to five different people.  Instead,  I could send  one  check  to
     IFNA,  indicating  the utilities I was paying for.  IFNA would in
     Fidonews                     Page 6                   27 Apr 1987


     turn reimburse the appropriate software authors for the  programs
     I had acquired and purchased.  In the end, I would feel as though
     I had paid a legitimate fee for the programs I was using,  and at
     the same time I could feel like a philanthropist because I  would
     know  that  I was making a small (but meaningful) contribution to
     the IFNA coffers in the  process.  Personally,  I'd  feel  a  lot
     better  about  this form of reimbursement than I am feeling about
     the present 'shareware circus'.

     Listen guys...I am not overly intimidated by threats that my soul
     is going to rot in hell if I don't pay for my shareware software.
     After all, there are worse places I could end up...  (Los Angeles
     for example).

     George Falcon
     FIDO 109/648

              Mensa Telecomputing SIG Coordinator Seeks Sysops

     I'm looking for sysops with nodes  already  established  who  are
     willing  to join Mensa,  the society for those with scores in the
     top 2% on standardized tests.  A few questions  will  undoubtedly
     come to mind, among them:

        1. Why are you looking for sysops?
        2. What is Mensa, anyway?
        3. What are the requirements for membership?
        4. Why should I join Mensa?

     1. I'm  looking for sysops because I hope (and this is a personal
        wish,  not official policy of Mensa,  which  has  no  official
        policy  or  opinion)  that  one  day  American  Mensa,  Ltd.'s
        official computer communication needs can be fulfilled by  the
        network  of  FIDO  nodes already established around the world.
        This would benefit Mensa  in  that  it  could  accomplish  its
        electronic  communications  goals  less expensively.  It could
        benefit sysops should American Mensa,  Ltd.  and IFNA reach  a
        common   understanding  regarding  donations  to  those  nodes
        handling American Mensa's communications traffic.  Thirdly, it
        could benefit  those  shareware  authors  whose  programs  are
        considered  by  Mensa  to be essential to the handling of that
        traffic.

     2. What is Mensa,  anyway?  Mensa is an international society  in
        which the sole requirement for qualification for membership is
        a  score at or above the 98th percentile on any of a number of
        standard I.Q. tests.  Mensa is a non-profit organization whose
        main purpose is to serve  as  a  means  of  communication  and
        assembly  for  its  members.  Special  Interest  Groups within
        Mensa provide a basis for involvement  in  various  activities
        and the sharing of opinions and ideas.

     3. What  are  the requirements for membership?  Qualification for
        membership may be determined by tests administered by Mensa or
        by  submission  of  properly  certified  prior  evidence.  All
        inquiries should be addressed to:

               American Mensa, Ltd.
               2626 E. 14th St.
               Brooklyn, N.Y.  11235-3992

        Chances  are  pretty  good  that,   if  you  can  unravel  the
        complications of running a bulletin board, you can qualify for
        membership.  Membership dues are currently $33 a  year.  There
        are currently approximately 52,000 members in American Mensa.

     4. Why should I join Mensa?  My recommendation is that you should
        join  because  it's a lot of fun.  I've had some very positive
        experiences with Mensa...  among them:  finding a job, finding
        someone  with  whom  to share a house,  finding an excellently
     Fidonews                     Page 8                   27 Apr 1987


        maintained used BMW motorcycle,  and last  but  certainly  not
        least,  finding  the  love of my life,  my wife (and co-sysop)
        Dot.  From what I've heard,  the three largest SIGs  in  Mensa
        are  Sexyg  (for  the discussion of human sexuality),  Singles
        Network SIG,  and GaySIG.  At first glance it would seem  that
        bright  people  join  Mensa  to meet other bright people,  but
        Mensa offers a great deal  more  than  that  opportunity.  Our
        members  are  celebrated authors,  CEO's of huge corporations,
        accountants,  mail carriers,  clerks,  and computer designers.
        We  skydive,  listen  to  music,  go  to  parties,  listen  to
        interesting speakers, read books, write books, design and sell
        computers, write software, and share our lives.  Will you find
        Mensa to be exactly as much fun or as rewarding?  Like all the
        other aspects of life,  that  depends  on  you  more  than  it
        depends on Mensa.

     5. Will American Mensa,  Ltd.  pay me for running a section of my
        bulletin board dedicated to Mensans if I join  and  adjust  my
        area  privilege  levels  so  that  only Mensans can access the
        Mensa area?  NO!  I cannot emphasize strongly enough that I do
        not speak  for  American  Mensa,  Ltd.  American  Mensa,  Ltd.
        encourages  members  to  join  together  in pursuit of special
        interests,  and,  to this end,  acts as  the  facilitator  and
        clearinghouse   for   SIG   activities.   SIGs  are  voluntary
        associations of Mensa members which operate  independently  of
        Mensa.  Mensa  does  not exercise control over the finances or
        activities of SIGs and no SIG or SIG coordinator is authorized
        to bind Mensa or to act in any  way  on  Mensa's  behalf.  For
        these  reasons,  Mensa is not responsible for actions taken by
        or on behalf of SIGs, nor for their financial liabilities.  It
        is my personal opinion,  and not that  of  Mensa,  that  if  a
        nonprofit  organization  were  to  find FidoNet an economical,
        practical alternative to a commercial  data  utility  such  as
        Delphi,  that  it  would  benefit FidoNet,  Tom Jennings,  the
        nonprofit organization, shareware utility authors, sysops, and
        the computer telecommunications industry in  general  for  the
        parties   concerned   to   arrive  at  a  mutually  acceptable
        agreement.

     I encourage your  comments  and  constructive  criticism.  Please
     feel  free  to  send  them  to  me  via  CompuServe  (76266,500),
     SourceMail  (AAK582),  FidoMail  or  crashmail  (109/648),  or by
     calling  our   system   ("The   Falcon's   Rock")   directly   at
     (301) 345-7459.

          Even this newsletter must have a deadline,  if it's to reach
     you  on  time.  It should be in the mail before the highly-touted
     April 2 IBM announcement date,  so let  me  comment  on  what  we
     believe is going to happen.

          The  rumor  mill seems to be fairly consistent...  enough so
     that a reporter with one major daily was writing his story on the
     announcement when I spoke to him on  March  25!  So,  remembering
     that the rumor mill is fallible, here goes.

          From what we hear,  IBM will announce new products in the PC
     and XT arena,  using the 8086 processor.  They are reported to be
     reconfigured into a smaller,  lower form factor.  So,  while they
     should use present XT- style boards,  it's not clear whether they
     will  use  only short boards,  or short and long ones.  Disks are
     reported to be 3.5-inch,  760Kb units,  and the price  for  a  2-
     floppy computer is quoted consistently at $1,695.

          How will this compare with the Tandy 1000 SX?  Our engineers
     tell us that comparing a 6Mhz (apparently a common speed) 8086 to
     a  7.16Mhz  8088  (as used by the Tandy 1000),  the 8086 executes
     some type of instructions faster,  and the 8088 wins the race  on
     other  types.  Bottom  line  is there should be little noticeable
     difference in throughput.

          I'm looking at a report from a major New York analyst  which
     says  that  these  low-end  products won't be proprietary and the
     price is high.  He concludes that  "IBM  has  ceded  the  low-end
     market to the clone manufacturers." ... and of course those of us
     who manufacture "compatibles" rather than "clones."

          There will also be one or more 80286 machines ranging from a
     Tandy  3000  HL-class  box  at  $3,500 to an AT-class one at over
     $6,000.  Now comes the "proprietary" aspect of  the  announcement
     we've  all  heard  about.  These  machines will also use 3.5-inch
     floppy drives, but not the familiar 760Kb...  these will be 1.4Mb
     drives.  There's  also a rumored new 32-bit bus for '286 and '386
     machines.  While they  will  have  eight  expansion  slots,  they
     apparently  will  not  accept  any XT or AT expansion cards as we
     know them today.  Some communications functions are  expected  in
     ROM.  From  what  we hear,  it's going to be things like 3270 and
     Token Ring.

          If this is true, we believe the communications features will
     be of interest only to the very  largest  corporate  customers...
     maybe  200 companies.  IBM appears to be trying to strengthen its
     position with its largest customers rather than  to  broaden  the
     market.   And   it  looks  like  silicon  implementation  of  the
     communications capabilities  is  primarily  a  convenience  item,
     Fidonews                     Page 10                  27 Apr 1987


     since  almost  any  type  of connectivity you can name is already
     available through add-in cards and/or software.

          We're hearing about one to three versions of an  80386-based
     computer,  too,  probably  ranging  from $7,000 to $10,000,  also
     using the 1.4Mb floppy drives and the new format expansion slots.
     Hard drives from 40 to  100  Mb  are  predicted.  There  is  some
     disagreement  on  clock speeds with reports ranging from 16 to 20
     Mhz.

          Out of a dozen industry watchers, editors and reporters I've
     spoken to,  eleven have agreed on what this  all  means.  If  the
     rumors  are  fairly  accurate,  it means IBM is concentrating its
     effort in the higher-ticket, mainframe-related area, and will not
     move aggressively in the low-end.  This  is  probably  very  good
     news for Tandy, since our major strength is in the low-end.

          Compatible vendors who have differentiated their products by
     including additional features,  functions, and benefits (not just
     feature-for-feature clones) should  be  the  least  affected.  In
     potentially  the  worst  position  are  the clone makers who bolt
     together parts to sell products -- usually by mail  --  on  price
     alone.

          At  any  rate,  that's  how it looks to us a week before the
     announcement.  On April 2 the stage will be set.  But don't  look
     for any real verdict for 30 days or so after that.  There will be
     those automatic "if it's Big Blue,  it must be good" reactions in
     the  press.  After  the  dust  settles  and  potential users have
     digested the products,  we will begin to sense any real impact of
     IBM's  latest  move.  Until then,  I'm happy to say it looks like
     Tandy will be little affected,  and could gain from any  IBM  de-
     emphasis on the low-end. ------

                                  CLUB 100

          Last  month  I mentioned what might be the largest Model 100
     user group.  I asked "can anyone top that?" Rick Hansen  of  Club
     100  asked  me  to  make  it clear that the group isn't trying to
     compete with anyone...  in fact their objective is  to  cooperate
     with  other  clubs and user groups to achieve maximum benefit for
     all Model 100 users. Sorry, Rick... hope I didn't mislead anyone.

                       TANDY  1000 SX WITH HARD DISK

          There's a new version of the 1000 SX available for those  of
     you who intend to add a hard card, and need only one floppy disk.
     The  catalog number is 25-1052,  and suggested retail is $849.00.
     It's  available  at  our  Computer  Centers,  Plus  Centers,  and
     participating dealers.

                        GOOD NEWS FOR COCO 3 OWNERS

          At long last,  OS-9 Level II (Cat.  No.  26-3031, $79.95) is
     shipping.  The package comes with  BASIC-09  (the  original  OS-9
     package   contained   an  Editor/Assembler  rather  than  BASIC.)
     Fidonews                     Page 11                  27 Apr 1987


     Standard drivers are included,  plus we've added drivers for both
     40 and 80-track drives.

          "High level" (or specialty drivers) i.e.  hard disk, will be
     included in the OS-9 Development System,  scheduled now for  June
     shipment (Cat.  No. 26-3032, $99.95.)

                            TRACKSTAR QUESTIONS

          A number of questions have come up about the Trackstar board
     (allows Tandy 1000 and 1000 SX to run Apple II software.)

          First, let me say that we feel the unit must be installed by
     our  service  center.   The  computer's  disk  drive(s)  must  be
     completely removed,  and  there  is  some  system  "fine  tuning"
     required. Installation charge is $25.00.

          We've been asked a number of times if Trackstar will operate
     in  the IBM PC and other compatibles.  In general,  the answer is
     yes...  it is  not  specific  to  our  compatibles.  However,  we
     install,  warrant  and  support  the  product  only  in  our  own
     computers.  Since we don't support (and therefore haven't  tried)
     it in non-Tandy products,  we can't comment on whether or not its
     use  in  such  computers  will  result  in  the   same   software
     compatibility rate we quote for our computers.

                        ACOUSTIC CUPS FOR PORTABLES

          The  original  acoustic cups for telephone connection to our
     portables, have been discontinued.  A new version (Cat.  No.  26-
     3818) is expected to be available about mid-April.  Electrically,
     the circuit is identical to the older cups.

          Physical improvements have been made.  These include changes
     to the cable and the way  it  exits  the  cups,  to  improve  its
     ability  to  withstand  heavy  daily  use  by members of the news
     media.  The cup design has also been changed to allow it to  work
     on the "square" handsets found on some phones.

                          DMP-105 PRINTER IMPROVED

          How  do  you  make  a  good thing better?  One way is to add
     features without raising the price.  The DMP-105, our lowest-cost
     dot  matrix  printer,  has been replaced by the new DMP-106 (Cat.
     No.  26-2802).  Specifications are exactly the same except  we've
     added IBM PC graphics compatibility. ------

                    AVAILABILITY OF ADVERTISED PRODUCTS

          Back in our early days in the PC industry, everything was in
     a  constant  state of backorder.  The few players in our industry
     all had the same problems. The waiting list for disk drives was 4
     months... "Level II ROMs" were 6 months, and so on.  Software was
     often  in  short  supply,  and  availability  of new software was
     difficult to predict due to the possibility of  last-minute  bugs
     being found.

          Radio Shack's now president, Bernie Appel, isn't one to live
     with advertising product before it's available.  He established a
     hard and fast rule.  If on the day we sent an ad to a magazine or
     newspaper,  the  product  advertised was not in the warehouse and
     available for shipment, the ad was canceled. That rule remains in
     effect today.

          However...  there have been  cases  recently  of  advertised
     products  not  being  available  when the ad ran.  Customers have
     asked why this happens.

          The most visible recent case was the  December  Radio  Shack
     flyer which reached customers in the latter part of November.  It
     advertised a special offer on the Tandy 1000 SX.  Yet by the time
     you received it, there was no chance of ordering and receiving an
     SX before Christmas.

          In the case of a flyer, the copy is "locked in stone" a long
     time  before  you  see  it.  The  artwork is done and sent to the
     printer.  Color separations are done,  and plates are  made.  Our
     typical  flyer  print  run  is  18-24 million copies!  So you can
     imagine the logistics of preparing, printing and mailing.  By the
     time we knew SXs would be in short supply, it was far too late to
     make a change.

          There are other cases where we change the product, as in the
     acoustic cups listed above. We tried be sure we had enough of the
     older   models  to  cover  us  until  the  new  ones  came.   Our
     merchandising people are expert at  handling  these  transitions,
     but  once  in  a  while a surge in demand or delay in new product
     shipment will surprise us.

          I know it's an inconvenience to  good  customers  when  this
     happens, and we'll break our backs to try to see that it doesn't.
     We  don't  like having to explain delays on a product to hundreds
     of customers any more than you like being kept waiting.

          The very strong Christmas season caught us  off  guard.  The
     result  has  been  a  few  more of these instances than have been
     usual. We apologize for them.

          I want you to know that at Tandy Center,  being out  of  any
     product - especially an advertised one - is a very serious issue,
     and one we make every effort to avoid.

     Bob Arnold
     Random Access BBS - 260/320

               Technical Topics - IBM's New Computer Systems


     The following is the text of  one  of  my  recent  Random  Access
     Computer  Columns  appearing in the Syracuse (NY) Herald-American
     STARS Magazine.

     I hope this will shed some light on IBM's new models. Please keep
     in  mind  that  no  systems  were  available  to  me  for   close
     examination  when  this  piece  was  first  written.  Systems are
     available now on a limited basis.  As a result,  I'm working on a
     more  detailed  report  for both the newspaper and the readers of
     the FIDO Newsletter.


     Special Random Access for April 19, 1987 -

     IBM's announcement of its new System 2 line of personal computers
     on April 2nd was decidedly NOT a late April fools joke played  on
     the  computer  industry.  In this special report I'll look at the
     hardware in some depth,  at IBM's  past  track  record  with  new
     systems, and just where these new systems leave the clone makers.

     First,  the hardware details.  IBM announced 4 new basic computer
     systems available in several different packages.

     The common things amoung the new machines are the standardization
     by IBM on the 3.5 inch ``floppy'' disk format.  All  of  the  new
     systems contain at least one internal 3.5 inch drive. Each system
     uses  a  common  keyboard  design  including 12 function keys,  a
     complete numeric keypad,  lights for several of the  status  keys
     such  as  caps  lock  and  scroll  lock  and  cursor control keys
     seperate from the numeric keypad.

     The System 2 Model 30 uses the 8086 CPU running at  8  Megahertz.
     The  8086  is the big brother of the 8088 chip used in the PC and
     XT systems and is capable of much more than the  8088.  Space  is
     provided to add an optional 8087 math processor chip.  The RAM is
     now at the 640k limit and may be expanded by  the  use  of  extra
     memory  boards as used on the PC/XT systems.  Like the PC and XT,
     additional memory above 640K is not directly useable.  It can  be
     used for high speed RAM discs or additional data storage with the
     proper software.

     A  built-in parallel printer port,  serial modem port,  and mouse
     interface provide easy connections for those devices without  the
     need  for  additional  boards.  Three  internal  expansion  slots
     following the now ``standard'' XT style  bus  are  available  for
     use.
     Fidonews                     Page 15                  27 Apr 1987


     The  Model  30  has IBM's new ``MultiColor Graphics Array'' video
     board.   The  board  supports  4  modes  of  operation  in   both
     monochrome  and  color modes.  The color resolution is 640 by 480
     pixels (dots) in 2 colors or 320 by  200  in  up  to  256  colors
     selected  from  a possible 256,000 colors.  If you use one of the
     new monochrome displays you'll get 64 shades of ``grey''.

     The Model 30-002 comes with two of the  3.5  inch  floppy  drives
     having a capacity of 720K each.  This is the lowest priced of the
     new systems.  The Model 30-021 comes with one 3.5 inch floppy and
     a 20 megabyte internal hard drive.

     The Model 30 series will run PC-DOS 3.3 and any (it's claimed) of
     the older versions of DOS after and including DOS  2.1.  It  will
     NOT  run the new Operating System 2 (OS2) available for the other
     new machines.  More about this later.

     The Model 50 series is based on the same 80286 CPU chip  used  in
     the  AT  systems.  The  CPU  runs  at  10  Megahertz and space is
     provided for an optional 80287 math processor  chip.  Again,  the
     3.5 inch drive is standard. There's a new wrinkle though. IBM has
     found  a way to pack 1.44 megabytes onto a 3.5 inch floppy.  A 20
     megabyte fixed disk is standard.  Like the AT, memory can be used
     in  large  ammounts.  Here  one megabyte is standard.  A parallel
     port,   serial  port  and  mouse  port  round  out  the  internal
     equipment.  Three  slots  are available for expansion.  The Video
     Graphics Array used in this and the rest of the new line supports
     MCGA,  CGA,   and  EGA  graphics  modes  as  well  as  monochrome
     operation.

     The  Model  60  shares  the  features  of the Model 50 with a few
     important changes.  First,  a 44 meg hard drive is standard.  The
     design  of  the system cabinet has been changed to permit the use
     of a floor stand.  In fact, it must be used in this fashion.

     The Model 80 is IBM's entry into the 30386 based machine  market.
     Three  models are available.  The first two models run at a clock
     speed of 16 Megahertz and have 1 meg  of  RAM  standard.  Storage
     available  is a 1.44 meg floppy and a 44 meg (Model 80-041) or 70
     meg (Model 80-071) drive. The Model 80-111 sports 2 meg of RAM, a
     115 meg hard drive and a CPU speed of 20 megahertz.

     Prices  for  these  systems  start  at around $1700 for the Model
     30-002 and go up to over $10,000 for the Model 80-111.

     Just what does all this mean?  Well,  IBM has finally settled  on
     the   3.5  inch  drive  as  standard.   This  will  mean  initial
     uncertainty as users may be reluctant to convert  over  from  the
     present  5  1/4  inch  standard.  With  each  new  major computer
     release,  IBM has come up with another  new  floppy  format.  The
     PC/XT  used 5 1/4 inch drives holding 360k each.  The AT followed
     with a 5 1/4 inch drive holding 1.2 Megabytes.  The Model 30  now
     has  a  3.5  inch  drive  of 720K and the 50,  60,  and 80 series
     machines all use 3.5 inch drives holding 1.44 meg.

     This progression has caused confusion and resulted in problems at
     Fidonews                     Page 16                  27 Apr 1987


     each occurance.  The new 3.5  meg  drive  technology  has  proven
     itself on other computer systems most notably the Apple Macintosh
     and  the  Atari  ST series.  The problems may lie in IBM's use of
     higher densities involved in the new 1.44 meg 3.5 inch  floppies.
     This  is indicated by the fact that the 1.2 meg 5 1/4 inch drives
     now used on the AT are simply not as reliable as the  older  360K
     drives.

     The  real  problem  will  be  in  the  conversion of software now
     running on 5 1/4 inch discs to the 3.5 inch  format.  Unprotected
     software  can simply be copied to a new 3.5 inch disc.  Protected
     software will either have to be run from an optional  external  5
     1/4  inch  drive  or  a  new  version on the smaller disc must be
     purchased.

     IBM introduced two new operating systems for  use  with  the  new
     computers.  PC-DOS  3.3  is  an  upgrade  of  the present DOS 3.2
     package.  Several new commands were added to  provide  additional
     flexibility.  DOS  3.3  will serve as an interim operating system
     until Operating System 2 (OS2) becomes available for the  50,  60
     and  80  computers.  OS2  will  NOT run on any 8088 or 8086 based
     computers such as the PC/XT/AT or even the  new  Model  30.  It's
     intended for use only on 80286 and 80386 based systems. It is not
     yet  clear  if  it  will  operate on systems not carrying the IBM
     brand.

     OS2 is being called a true multi-tasking system. Multi-tasking is
     the ability to have the computer run more than one program  at  a
     time.  OS2  includes built-in support for a wide range of devices
     and services.  PC-DOS 3.3  is  being  called  the  operating  for
     single  tasking applications.  Like previous versions of DOS,  it
     is possible to do multi-tasking with additional utilities.

     IBM has had a few  troubles  when  it's  introduced  new  systems
     though.  The PCjr,  PC Portable (the luggable XT), the laptop and
     the RT are good examples. The PCjr never was well accepted in the
     large numbers IBM had hoped for due to an original poor  keyboard
     design  and  then  incompatibilities  resulting  from the overall
     design of the system.

     The Portable was simply a re-packaged XT.  The machine  had  room
     for  only  2  full  length expansion boards,  a single 2/3 length
     board and 5 more boards a bit  less  than  half  card  size.  The
     laptop  system  didn't  get  out in time to really capture a good
     segment of the market in view of the  existing  competition.  The
     much  touted  RT computer hasn't sold well because of price (over
     10,000 for the basic system) and lack of available software.

     IBM has not been known for announcing ``vaporware''. However, the
     Model 80 won't be available until sometime in the last quarter of
     1987.  They're now taking orders on the models  30,  50  and  60.
     Local  response has been mixed.  The stores are excited about the
     new systems but at this writing (April 8) none were available for
     immediate sale in the Syracuse, NY market.

     As for the rest of the computer industry,  everyone is  taking  a
     Fidonews                     Page 17                  27 Apr 1987


     ``wait and see'' attitude. These machines are entirely new inside
     and  out.  As  a  result,  the  issues  of  hardware and software
     compatibility are of prime concern.  The overall feeling is  that
     the  new  machines  won't  stop the clone makers in their tracks.
     Many users are predicting that it will just take a bit longer  to
     make a compatible system.

          This has  been another  busy week,  sometime "real soon now"
     I'll have a week that isn't that busy  and I'll  be able  to look
     over some  of the  more serious packages I have laying around. By
     serious package I mean something that can not  be mastered  in 15
     minutes and  often, but  not always,  has a big price tag. In the
     meantime I'm learning more  about the  programs that  I have been
     using regularly.

          I've  decided  to  look  into  WordPerfect  as  a  new  word
     processor and have been looking over several books on it. This is
     primarily due  to the  good things  I've heard about the product,
     both people I've talked to and write-ups in magazines. I doubt it
     will replace  Word as my standard word processor, but that's only
     because I don't think I'll be able to afford it (I got  a special
     deal on  Word, and  I'm not holding my breath on a similar deal).
     Besides that I've learned  quite  a  bit  about  Word  due  to my
     experiences with Ventura Publisher.

     -- Style sheets and Microsoft Word --

          It took  Ventura to get me to really understand style sheets
     and how  to use  them. It's  nice to  bring up  a word processor,
     press alt-c  and have  all the  basic information for this column
     ready to go. Press alt-w and  the  format  for  my  weekly report
     comes up  instead. Since I have two different types of paragraphs
     (the  "headers"  between  some  paragraphs  and   the  body  text
     paragraphs themselves),  I set up two different paragraph styles.
     Since Word carries over the attributes of the  previous paragraph
     when starting  a new  one, it greatly simplifies my life. Instead
     of constantly changing the margins (or forgetting the initial tab
     at the start of a paragraph), I merely hit two or three keys when
     changing styles or parts of  a  document  and  everything changes
     (margins, fonts,  indents, etc.). It's made my life a lot easier,
     although it did take  me awhile  to understand  it. I  think it's
     working better  than it  did with  the bunch of SuperKey macros I
     had originally set up to be  used with  my columns.  Once you get
     used  to  the  concepts  behind  style sheets it works out rather
     well, although the manuals  don't explain  everything as  well as
     they  should.  If  you  are  using  Word  and haven't explored or
     learned about style sheets  yet, spend  an afternoon  in the near
     future learning how to use them. It will be time well spent.

     -- New surge protector --

          My weekly  visit to  my local dealer turned up something new
     and worthwhile, a new surge protector  for my  system. While I've
     had some  form of  surge protection  on the  power lines into the
     computer for as long as I've  owned my  current system,  this one
     had a new twist. In addition to giving me the 6 outlets, it has a
     LED indicator that it is working (read protecting)  the equipment
     and an  in and out jack for the phone line. This greatly appealed
     to me because while I've never  lost  a  system,  I  have  lost a
     modem. It's  what caused me to move up to 2400 baud, my 1200 died
     (during an electrical storm) and I was able to get  a great price
     on the Tecmar Phonegate. The new surge protector was only $20 and
     was from QVS. My equipment hasn't died suddenly,  so I'm assuming
     Fidonews                     Page 19                  27 Apr 1987


     it working  reasonably well.  While no  surge protector out there
     will protect a machine from a  direct lighting  strike, it's well
     worth spending  a few  extra dollars to protect a thousand dollar
     plus investment from the more "normal" line surges. Your price on
     the same  unit may be a little higher, I don't know what the list
     price on it is,  as I  get discounted  prices through  my dealer.
     I've been  stopping by  his store  fairly regularly  for the past
     three years, and usually buy my  software and  hardware from him.
     Some of the tips and information he's given me are well worth the
     higher prices (as compared to mail order). I'd strongly encourage
     you  to  find  a  similar  dealer in your area because while mail
     order prices may be cheaper,  the  mail  order  companies usually
     can't answer too many questions when you run into trouble or need
     some help.

     -- Winding down... --

          I'm still playing JET  (due to  an overdose  of watching the
     movie Top  Gun), although the effects of the movie are dying off.
     I haven't even come close to a 12 to 1 kill ratio, and I'm almost
     ready to  give up.  One last  thing I want to try before shelving
     the game is take advantage of  a bug  I've heard  about. It seems
     that in  the ground version of the game, you can supposedly enter
     the flight hanger at any speed and still refuel and  re-arm. I've
     been trying  to enter the hanger at speeds greater than mach one.
     After re-arming I should be exiting the hanger at the  same speed
     I entered  it! Let  me warn  you, it is not easy trying to keep a
     plane a few feet off the ground at those speeds.  I've cracked up
     quite a  few planes trying to do it, and think I've nearly gotten
     the hang of it. If all goes well I'll let  you know  if the "bug"
     exists next week.

          Since I  decided to  learn how to use WordPerfect, I've been
     doing a  lot  of  reading  about  the  program.  While  I haven't
     actually used  the program,  and don't think I'm going to like it
     to well judging from what I've read, I have book  learned quite a
     bit about  it. The  best book on beginning WordPerfect I've found
     is "Using WordPerfect" by Deborah Beacham and Walton Beacham (QUE
     Corp.  $18.95).  It  seems  to  cover  the  basics of the program
     adequately  as  well  as  covering  some  of  the  more  advanced
     features. My  only complaint  is that  it centers  on version 4.0
     with a few additional sections on version 4.1,  while the current
     version is  4.2. Hopefully  most of  it will apply when I finally
     get a chance to look it over.

          Sorry for  the short  column this  week, but  I finally took
     another  look   at  the  Sysop  echomail  conference  and  became
     disgusted  with  certain  individuals.   These  few   sysops  are
     unbelievably    childish,    inconsiderate   (read   rude),   and
     irresponsible and it has put a  damper on  the muse  for the time
     being. Hopefully next week will work out better, and I won't even
     be tempted to look over that echomail conference for a few weeks.
     In  the  meantime,  I  welcome  your  comments and suggestions on
     anything I've written about or something you think I should write
     about. If  you're a  user of  a bulletin board, please mention to
     your sysop that mail to me must be routed through 157/0, 157/1 or

     take note of that last sentence. All of  those nodes  are running
     SEAdog  so  you  shouldn't  have  to  worry  to  much  about mail
