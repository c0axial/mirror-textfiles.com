     =================================================================


     Some folks are resisting this but an Internet presence for FidoNet
     already exists and it's going to keep building.

     For one thing, it's often cheaper for Sysops to get their files via
     Internet links where connect time is virtually unlimited and filesize
     irrelevant. Just look at the current ELRUL701.ZIP file for example.
     It's 1.3Megs and a lot of files that size add up at normal phone
     rates on BBS connections that aren't local.

     The Internet also provides real-time links like IRC [Internet Relay
     Chat] and nearly instant email turnaround without waiting for routing
     schedules. It's also visual and just plain fun. [grin]

     I've started YAILTF [Yet Another Internet Link To FidoNet] in the form
     of what is known as a WebRing for FidoNet [see article below]. It now
     has 3 pages listed. You can be next!

     This doesn't mean FidoNet is being taken over by the Internet. But
     folks who like to communicate and experiment started FidoNet and many
     of them also have an Internet presence. Even Tom Jennings has a
     webpage [www.wps.com] while he no longer has a Node number.

     FidoNet will still be an amateur BBS network [even though you don't
     need a BBS to be a FidoNet Sysop] and will still fill a niche no other
     group does but we're also all over the Web and growing there faster
     than here. Ironic, isn't it?

     Well, the Jacksonville Jaguars [football for non-U.S. types] are still
     down by 7 in the AFC Championship game but they love to come from
     behind and this Issue is ready for bed.

     Enjoy! And SEND me some .BIOs and ASCII art!! Or I'll write longer
     editorials. [snicker]

     =================================================================


     In the Editorial of FidoNews 1351 [16 Dec 96], I misquoted the Possum
     Oath of Red Green as it might be applied to FidoNet ops of late.

     The correct Latin is:

     Quando Omni Flunkus Moritati

     and not Moratatus as previously indicated. Something about subjunctive
     superlatives of gerundives twice removed. [grin]

     The meaning stated was correct:

     "When all else fails, play dead."

     Sorry about that.

     FidoNet Internet sites go circular?

     Christopher Baker
     Rights On!, 1:18/14
     (cbaker84@digital.net)

     There are a number of FidoNet-related websites and pages out there on
     the Internet. Many of them are listed in FidoNews by Internet section
     at the end of each Issue.

     They are not connected in any sense other than being available on the
     World Wide Web [WWW] and if you want to visit them you need to enter
     each site's address into your browser one after the other. You can
     then bookmark them for your personal list if you wish. Primitive.

     I've discovered out there in webland a site called WebRing
     [http://www.webring.org] that has figured out a new way to make it
     easier than ever to find sites of like content and then wander amongst
     them in a virtual circle in cyberspace. It's a free service offered by
     WebRing to all who apply for unique ringnames.

     A WebRing is sort of like a FidoNet website Echo. There isn't any
     direct interaction [outside of signing onto the ring] between the
     sites but all the sites are in a common list a websurfer can scoot
     around in until s/he comes full circle.

     I have started the FidoNet World Wide WebRing on the WebRing server.
     They provide all the cgi effects and all you have to do is follow the
     instructions on the FidoNet WWWRing page at:

                  http://ddi.digital.net/~cbaker84/fnetring.html

     and pick up the two graphics and the code blurb for your site's page.
     You do have to know something about HTML programming but the code
     blurb has all you need to get started. The sign-up page also contains
     entry areas for your page URL and email address. Once you've signed up
     you need to put the code on your page and then send email to the
     RingMaster [me]. You will receive email from WebRing as well with info
     on further steps required.

     It's not as complicated as it sounds on paper. Once the server tells
     me your page is in the queue for addition to the Ring, I go check it
     for continuity and then advise on corrections or add your page to the
     Ring for others to find.

     FidoNews is Site 1 and already on the Ring. I invite you to add your
     page[s] to the FidoNews World Wide Web Ring today!

     QOFM.
     Chris

     Peace on Earth, etc.
     by Troy H. Cheek (1:362/708.4)

     Another Christmas has passed.  This year, I got mostly clothes.  I
     take it as a sign of old age that this is actually what I wanted.

     In the first FIDONEWS issue of this New Year, Michael Wilson suggests,
     among other things, that Fidonet should be easier to access.

     Now, I agree that the archaic practice refusing to offer programs or
     technical assistance to new users until they've got their system set
     up well enough to send you netmail is, well, archaic.  Unfortunately,
     it was still in place locally when I set up as a point not too many
     years ago.  :-(  Obviously, we need to be more helpful to people who
     want to join in on the fun.

     However, some kind of central access to Fidonet with some kind of
     standardized program and a single phone number to call is taking
     things a bit too far in the other direction, IMHO.

     For example, I just suffered through another yearly episode of a drama
     some people like to call Modem-mas.  Or maybe it's a sit-com.  On or
     around Christmas (this year, it hit early) technically-illiterate
     newbies get their first computer and/or modem.  In spite of the fact
     that we moan how people can't find Fidonet, these people do.

     (A similar effect can be noted at the start and end of each school
     year, as students relocate.)

     It's bad enough, and understandable enough, to have to explain
     echomail conferences, moderators, netmail, and echolag to BBS users
     who stumble into an echo and begin treating it like the local chat
     message base.  It's downright bizarre to have to explain the same to
     someone who signs his messages "Sysop of the [Whatever] BBS."  Give
     Fidonet a quick and easy access point, and you can multiply this
     problem by a few hundred.

     Forget for a moment the question of why people are leaving Fidonet.
     Consider for a moment the question of why people are _staying_ with
     Fidonet.  One of the reasons I've heard over and over again is that
     Fidonet has a better signal/noise ratio than any other network.  Make
     access _too_ easy and that goes out the window.

     Speaking of Windows, a new slick front-end for Fidonet also has
     problems.  One of the other reasons why people stay with Fidonet is
     that you don't constantly need to buy the latest, fastest, and most
     expensive hardware to access it.  You don't even need any particular
     computer platform.

     In other words, I feel that if we change Fidonet to try to attract
     people who are already being better served by other Nets, we will
     simply alienate those who are sticking with Fidonet because it already
     serves their needs.  These people, I think, are what makes Fidonet

     what it is to begin with.

                                     A Bundle Proposal

                                      Wynn Wagner III
                                       January, 1988

     UPFRONT
     -------

     What follows is a proposal for a new structure of message bundles that
     are transmitted between Fidonet systems.

     Currently we deal with "packet version 2."  This is a proposed format
     for packet version three.

     The version number should be recognizable by TYPE-2 programs, but the
     older programs will not be able to do anything more than report an
     error.  In other words, there is no direct upwards compatibility
     except for the offset in the _BundleHeader (see below) of the TYPE-3
     signal.

     Because of this, any conversion should be slow... possibly a year or
     more.  Interim systems would have to be able to pack and unpack both
     kinds of bundles.  It would be required for the packer to know whether
     its target system knows about TYPE-3 bundles or not... either by some
     node list flag or by using a control file.

     I think it is important that a new structure be seriously considered,
     but it is also vital that we approach such a change with a mind to
     keeping it an evolutionary process rather than an overnight
     revolution.  It is important that TYPE-2 systems be retired using
     attrition instead of compulsion.

     This proposal is described in detail... possibly too much detail.
     The design looks scarier than it really is.  Code to process this
     kind of a bundle is almost trivial.

     One design feature is that putting a message bundle together is
     somewhat more involved than taking one apart.  The theory is that we
     will be getting more and more tiny installations operating as points.
     Collecting and unpacking such things as echomail will be easier even
     on small/slow computers.  Heavy volume traffic with lots of packing
     and unpacking is usually carried on by computers more capable of heavy
     work.  Please note that the added work on the shoulders of the packer
     is almost microscopic, but it exists.  This uneven distribution of the
     FIDONEWS 14-02               Page 7                   13 Jan 1997


     work is intentional.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

     PRELIMARIES: METHODS
     --------------------

              Messages are transmitted in "bundles."

              A bundle is a sequence of "packets."  Every bundle has at
              least two packets: a header and a footer.

              This document describes the layout and use of those
              packets as well as the general format of a bundle.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

     PRELIMINARIES: DATA
     -------------------

       #define BUNDLEVER 3
       #define EIDSIZ    (sizeof(struct _Address)+sizeof(unsigned long))

       struct _Address {
          unsigned int      Zone;
          unsigned int      Net;
          unsigned int      Node;
          unsigned int      Point;
       };

           DATA NOTES:

              "WORD" is a two byte unsigned integer with the most
                     significant byte first.  This storage arrangement is
                     backwards from the way INTEL chips store numbers, but
                     it is more in-line with the way the rest of the
                     universe does it.  The conversion for MsDOS and other
                     INTEL programmers is quite trivial.

                     A routine called SWAP can be used, where...

                             unsigned int pascal SWAP(unsigned int VALUE);

                     Here's the code...

                                 SWAP Proc Near
                                      mov   bx, sp
                                      mov   ax, [bx+2]
                                      xchg  ah, al
                                      ret 2
                                 SWAP EndP

              "UNSIGNED LONG" is a four byte unsigned integer with the most
                    significant word first.  Again, this storage
                    arrangement conflicts with the method used by INTEL,
                    but the trans-formation to "MSW first" is quite simple
     FIDONEWS 14-02               Page 8                   13 Jan 1997


                    and it really makes the non-MsDOS programmers feel more
                    comfortable.

              "UNSIGNED CHAR" is an 8-bit datum that can have any value
                    between 0 and 0xff.

              CHARACTER ARRAYS are null-padded unless otherwise noted.
                    There is a difference between "null-terminated" (common
                    to C-language programming) and "null-padded" found
                    here.  Unless there is a conflicting note,
                    insignificant bytes of a character array must be set to
                    zero.

              UNUSED DATA are always set to zero.

          unsigned char     B_FTSC[4];        /* Reserved by FTSC
     */
       };

           BUNDLE HEADER NOTES:

              The offset of B_Version coincides with the location of the
              `ver' field in type two bundle headers.

              The B_Local1 and B_Local2 fields have no meaning during the
              actual transfer.  It is to hold such information as COST
              and/or BAUD rate of use to the sending system.

              B_Password is a NULL-padded field that can contain uppercase
              alpha bytes or ASCII digits.  It should not contain lowercase

              characters, punctuation, control characters, etc.  This is a
              NULL-padded field... not just NULL-terminated.  A maximum of
              8 bytes are significant.

              Note that the BUNDLER is identified by product code.  This
              does NOT necessarily have anything to do with the software
              that actually transmits the bundle.  This structure deals
              with message bundles, and the product identification shows
              which computer program was responsible for that layer of
              a netmail session.  The software providing transportation
              is more properly identified during a session-level
              negotiation (eg WaZOO's YooHoo) or in a dynamically generated
              structure (eg TeLink's block zero).  TYPE-3 tries to keep the
              various layers of the system separate and easily
              identifiable.  This document describes data, not the method
              by which they are passed from one system to another.


           BUNDLE BODY NOTES:

              The bundle header packet is followed by one or more of the
              following packet types.  Each of these packets begin with
              two bytes that identify the packet version and the packet
              type.  In all cases, the version is three (0x03).

              Packet types include

                       END_SIGNAL        0
                       AREA_HEADER       1
                       MESSAGE_HEADER    2
                       TEXT              3
                       ECHOMAIL_INFO     4
                       MISCINFO          128-256

              One message is built using at least two packets
              (MESSAGE_HEADER and TEXT).  Optionally, a message might also
              have ECHOMAIL_INFO and MISCINFO packets.  Packets associated
              with a message must be bundled in numerical order (by packet
              type)... the header comes first, followed by the text,
              possibly followed by echomail information, and possibly
              ending with some miscellaneous packets.

              This arrangement of bundles allows the development of
              state machine type programs which effect efficient message
              processing even on slow or small computers.  Here's a
              quick coding example:

                    for(;;)
                      switch(fgetc(BUNDLE)) {
                         default:  printf("Not Type-3 message"); return -1;
                         case 3:   switch(fgetc(BUNDLE)) {
                                      case -1: printf("EOF?");   return -1;
                                      case 0:  printf("Done\n"); return 0;
                                      case 1:  GetMsgArea();     break;
                                      case 2:  GetMessage();     break;
                                      default: printf("Pkt?");   break;

                                   };
                      };

                          NOTE: For those re-reading and spotting what
     looks
                                like a mistake... the `GetMessage()'
     routine
                                would also take care of TEXT and any
     ECHOMAIL
                                or MISCINFO packets.

                                Also, for a little added robustness, the
                                default item that prints "Pkt?" should look
                                for a value of 0x03 (or and end of the
                                file)
                                before returning to the processing loop.

              All bundles end with this packet.  It is not optional.

     MESSAGE AREA
     ------------

       struct _AreaHeader {
          unsigned char     E_Version;        /* Always 3
     */
          unsigned char     E_PacketType;     /* Always 1
     */
          unsigned byte     E_NameLength;     /* Actual bytes in E_Name
     */
          unsigned byte     E_Name[1];        /* VARIABLE-length field
     */
       };

           AREA HEADER NOTES:

              The area header packet marks the start of a sequence of
              messages destined for the same message area.

              Often E_Name will contain the name of an echomail area.
     FIDONEWS 14-02               Page 11                  13 Jan 1997


              If the legnth and first byte of E_Name are zero, it means
              that the following messages are inter-system traffic
              (ie regular netmail).

              The maximum value for E_NameLength is 63.

              E_Name can contain uppercase characters, digits, and the
              following punctuation: $ . - _ & # @ !

              Note that E_NameLength combined with E_Name make up what
              is often considered a "Pascal style string."  E_Name is
              NOT a null-terminated array (aka "ASCIIZ").

     MESSAGE HEADER

     base) */
          unsigned int      M_Attributes;     /* Standard Fidonet

     */
          unsigned char     M_SubjectLength;  /* Number of bytes in SUBJECT
     */
       };

           MESSAGE HEADER NOTES:

              Every message begins with a message header packet.  This
              structure is created by the system where the message
              originated.  If there are any intermediate stops before
              it reaches its destination, it is the responsibility of
              intermediate systems to maintain all of this information
              without any modification.

              Following this header come three char-type data: FROM, TO,
              and SUBJECT.  Using the final three fields of the header,
              a program can quickly read and process/store the the message.

              None of the character items is null-terminated.  Their
              lengths are determined by values in the message header.

     MESSAGE TEXT/BODY

          unsigned char    T_PacketType;      /* Always 3
     */
          unsigned int     T_ByteCount;       /* Number of bytes ( <0x1000)
     */
          unsigned int     T_Data[1];         /* VARIABLE-length field
     */
       };

           TEXT NOTES:

              The body of a message is contained in one or more _Text
              packets.

              No _Text packet is ever more than 1000H bytes long.  That's
              4096 bytes to the terminally base-10 folks.  Of course there
              can be an infinite number of text packets, but you are
              absolutely positively guaranteed that with the TYPE-3 method,
              you will never need a buffer larger than 1000H.

              In addition to ASCII values 20h through 7Eh (inclusive),
              the following control codes are legal for TEXT data.
              Note that <cr> and <softCR> are NOT in this list.

                 <stx>  02H  ... material from here to next <lf> is
                                 a quote from the parent message
                 <lf>   0Ah  ... forced <cr/lf>
                 <dle>  10h  ... replicate

              Other control characters and values 7fH and above are
              symptoms of a damaged message.

              REPLICATE is a three byte sequence:  <dle><value><length>.
              For example, if a message contains the bytes 10h, 20h, 09h
              ...
              it would mean that message display programs should replicate
              the <space> character nine times.

              There is no minimum or maximum line length.  If there is no
              <lf> before the display program needs one, it is the display
              program's responsibility to provide the needed "line wrap."

              One "line" can cross from one _Text packet to another.

          struct _Address   EI_Seenby[1];     /* VARIABLE-length field
     */
       };

           ECHOMAIL INFO NOTES:

                 The EI_Parent and EI_Child fields contain some kind of
                 identification of the parent and child messages.  The size
                 of the fields corresponds to the size of an _Address
                 structure plus the size of a Unix-type time stamp.

     */
          unsigned char     MI_PacketType;    /* 0x80-0xff, assigned by
     FTSC */
          unsigned char     MI_ByteCount;     /* Size of miscinfo data
     */
          unsigned char     MI_WhoKnows;      /* Miscellaneous stuff
     */
       };

           MISCELLANEOUS INFO NOTES:

                 This is the catch-all packet type that replaces "The
                 Dreaded IFNA Kludge."

                 If present, they are the last packets associated with a
                 message.  _MiscInfo items are bound to a message, and it
                 is the responsibility of any packer to maintain any
                 _MiscInfo packets exactly as they arrived on any message
                 that will be retransmitted (ie netmail and echomail).

                 Values above 0xf0 have a special meaning.  They are
                 reserved for the severe case that FTSC needs to make some
                 kind of change that isn't backwards compatible.  In most
                 cases, unrecognized _MiscInfo packets should be preserved
                 but otherwise ignored.  If the packet type is 0xf0 through
                 0xff, it should be considered an error condition not to
                 understand the packet.

      A. Objectives of this document

         This document is directed at implementors or intellectuals.  It is
         meant for use in implementing applications that can use FOSSIL
         drivers, or for details needed to implement a new FOSSIL. As such
         it won't always go out of its way to explain itself to the
         neophyte.

         This document will have served its purpose to you if you are able
         to use the data contained within to perform either of the above
         tasks.  If you feel  that necessary  data has  been omitted
         please contact  Rick Moore at the above listed address so that the
         appropriate changes can be made.  Any lines changed in the current
         version are marked with "|" in the left margin.

      B. Historical perspective

         For those people who were not lucky enough to have an IBM PC or a
         system nearly completely compatible, the world has not been very
         friendly. With his implementation of the Generic Fido(tm) driver,
         Tom Jennings made it possible for systems that had nothing in
         common with an IBM PC except an 808x-class processor, and the
         ability to run MS-DOS Version 2 and above, to run his Fido(tm)
         software. That was a lot to ask, and a lot of people thought it
         was enough.

         But not everyone.  While Thom Henderson was debugging Version 4.0
     FIDONEWS 14-02               Page 15                  13 Jan 1997


         of his SEAdog(tm) mail package,  an "extended" Generic driver was
         designed  (in cooperation with Bob Hartman)   as a quick kludge to
         help him get past a problem with certain UART chips.The new hook
         was quickly pounced upon by Vince Perriello,  who, with almost
         DAILY prodding (ouch! it still hurts) by Ken Kaplan,had been
         working with Henderson to get DEC Rainbow support into SEAdog.
         Vince then coded a driver to use this hook and - Voila! -SEAdog
         4.0 started working like a champ on the Rainbow.

         At the same time something was rotten in the state of Texas. Wynn
         Wagner started  encountering some serious  difficulties in his
         Opus development effort. Specifically, he couldn't force the
         Greenleaf(tm) Communications Libraries to behave in exactly the
         way he felt Opus required.  Enter Bob Hartman.Having already
         enjoyed success in the effort with Thom Henderson, he suggested to
         Wynn that with very few extensions,  any driver that was already
         SEAdog(tm) 4.0 compatible could drive Opus as well.  About that
         time, Vince called Wynn to discuss porting Opus to the DEC
         Rainbow. Wynn called Bob, Bob called Vince, and the FOSSIL driver
         came into existence.

         FOSSIL is an acronym for "Fido/Opus/SEAdog Standard Interface
         Layer". To say that the concept has gained wide acceptance in the
         FidoNet community would be an understatement. Henk Wevers' DUTCHIE
         package uses the FOSSIL communications services.   Ron Bemis'
         OUTER package uses FOSSIL services for everything it does and as a
         result it is completely generic.  There are already FOSSIL
         implementations for the Tandy 2000, Heath/Zenith 100, Sanyo 555
         and other "non-IBM" architectures.  With each new 'port' of the
         spec, the potential of a properly coded FOSSIL application grows!

         The one basic rule that the driver depends upon,  is the ability
         for ANY target machine to allow the vector for INT 14h (usually
         pointing to BIOS comm functions) to be "stolen" by the driver.  In
         a system where the INT 14h vector is used already, it must be
         possible to replace the "builtin" functionality with that of a
         FOSSIL,  when an application that wants the use of a FOSSIL is to
         be run on the target machine.

         2)  How to install a FOSSIL driver in a system

         There's no hard and fast way to do this. The FOSSIL might be
         implemented as part of a device driver (like Ray Gwinn's X00.SYS)
         and therefore gets loaded using a line in CONFIG.SYS at bootup
         time.  It might be done as a TSR (terminate and stay resident)
         program, in which event you install it by running the program
         (DECcomm by Vince Perriello and Opus!Comm by Bob Hartman work this
         way, for example).

         3)  How an application can detect the presence of a FOSSIL

         The driver has a "signature" that can be used to determine whether
     FIDONEWS 14-02               Page 16                  13 Jan 1997


         it is present in memory. At offset 6 in the INT 14h service
         routine is a word, 1954h,  followed  by a  byte that  specifies
         the maximum function number supported by the driver. This is to
         make it possible to determine when a driver is present and what
         level of functionality it provides. Also, the Init call (see
         below)  returns a 1954h  in AX.  SEAdog(tm)  looks at the
         signature and Opus just goes for the Init. Fido doesn't do either.

         4)  How to call a FOSSIL function

         The FOSSIL driver  is entered  by issuing  a software Interrupt
         14h from the application  program. The code corresponding to the
         desired function should be in 8-bit register AH. For calls that
         relate to communications, the port number will be passed from the
         application in register DX. When DX contains a zero (0) it
         signifies use of COM1, or whatever the "first" serial port on your
         machine is called. A one (1) in DX points the driver at COM2, and
         so on.  A value of 00FFh in DX is considered a special case where
         the driver  should do no actual processing but return SUCCESS.  In
         the specific case of Init/Uninit with DX=00FFh,the FOSSIL should
         perform all non-communications  processing  necessary  with such
         calls.  In some machines  (H/Z-100 for example),  the FOSSIL must
         assume control of the keyboard in order to service the keyboard
         functions.

         FOR ALL FUNCTIONS,  ALL REGISTERS NOT SPECIFICALLY CONTAINING A
         FUNCTION RETURN VALUE MUST BE PRESERVED ACROSS THE CALL.

      D. Functions currently defined for FOSSILs

         AH = 00h    Set baud rate

                 Parameters:
                     Entry:  AL = Baud rate code
                             DX = Port number
     |               Exit:   AX = Port status (see function 03h)

         This works the same as the  equivalent IBM PC BIOS call,  except
         that it ONLY selects a baud rate.  This is passed in the high
         order 3 bits of AL as follows:

                     010 =   300 baud
                     011 =   600  ''
                     100 =  1200  ''
                     101 =  2400  ''
                     110 =  4800  ''
                     111 =  9600  ''
                     000 = 19200  '' (Replaces old 110 baud mask)
                     001 = 38400  '' (Replaces old 150 baud mask)

         The low order 5 bits can be implemented or not by the FOSSIL, but
         in all cases, if the low order bits of AL are 00011,  the result
         should be that the communications device should be set to eight
         data bits, one stop bit and no parity. This setting is a  MINIMUM
         REQUIREMENT  of Fido, Opus and SEAdog.  For purposes of
         completeness,  here are the IBM PC "compatible" bit settings:
     FIDONEWS 14-02               Page 17                  13 Jan 1997


         Bits 4-3 define parity:     0 0       no parity
                                     1 0       no parity
                                     0 1      odd parity
                                     1 1     even parity

         Bit 2 defines stop bits:      0        1 stop bit;
                                       1      1.5 bits for 5-bit char;
                                                2 for others

         Bits 1-0 character length:  0 0        5 bits
                                     0 1        6 bits
                                     1 0        7 bits
                                     1 1        8 bits

         AH = 01h    Transmit character with wait

                 Parameters:
                     Entry:  AL = Character
                             DX = Port number
                     Exit:   AX = Port status (see function 03h)

         AL contains the character to be sent.   If there is room in the
         transmit buffer the return will be immediate,  otherwise it will
         wait until there is room to store the character in the transmit
         buffer.  On return, AX is set as in a status request (see function
         03h).

         AH = 02h    Receive character with wait

                 Parameters:
                     Entry:  DX = Port number
                     Exit:   AH = 00h
                             AL = Input character

         If there is a character  available in the  receive buffer,
         returns with the next character in AL.  It will wait until a
         character is received if none is available.

         AH = 03h    Request status

                 Parameters:
                     Entry:  DX = Port number
                     Exit:   AX = Status bit mask (see below)

         Returns with the line and modem status in AX.  Status bits
         returned are:

                 In AH:
                     Bit 0 = RDA  - input data is available in buffer
     |               Bit 1 = OVRN - the input buffer has been overrun.  All
     |                              characters received after the buffer is
     |                              full should be discarded.
                     Bit 5 = THRE - room is available in output buffer
                     Bit 6 = TSRE - output buffer is empty

                 In AL:

     |               Bit 3 = Always 1 (always return with this bit set to
     1)
                     Bit 7 = DCD  - carrier detect

         This can be used by the application to determine  whether carrier
         detect (CD) is set,  signifying the presence/absence of a remote
         connection, as well as monitoring both the input and output buffer
         status.  Bit 3 of AL is always returned set to enable programs to
         use it as a carrier detect bit on hardwired (null modem) links.

         AH = 04h    Initialize driver

                 Parameters:
                     Entry:  DX = port number
                           ( BX = 4F50h
     |                       ES:CX = ^C flag address --- optional )
                     Exit:   AX = 1954h if successful
     |                       BL = maximum function number supported
     |                            (not counting functions 7Eh and above)
     |                       BH = rev of FOSSIL doc supported

         This is used to tell the driver to begin  operations,  and to
         check that the driver is installed. This function should be called
         before any other communications calls are made.  At this point all
         interrupts involved in supporting the comm port (specified in DX)
         should be set up for handling by  the  FOSSIL, then  enabled.  If
         BX contains 4F50h,  then the address specified in ES:CX is that of
         a ^C flag byte in the application program, to be incremented when
         ^C is detected in the keyboard service routines.  This is an
         optional service and only need be supported on machines where the
         keyboard service can't (or won't) perform an INT 1Bh or INT 23h
         when
     |   a Control-C is entered.  DTR is raised by this call.  The baud
     |   rate must NOT be changed by this call.

         NOTE: Should an additional call to this service occur  (2 Inits or
         Init, Read,Init, etc.) the driver should reset all buffers, flow
         control, etc.  to the INIT state and return SUCCESS.

         AH = 05h    Deinitialize driver

                 Parameters:
                     Entry:  DX = Port number
                     Exit:   None

         This is used to tell the driver that comm port operations are
         ended. The function should be called  when no more comm port
         functions will be used on the port specified in DX.  DTR is NOT
         affected by this call.

         AH = 06h    Raise/lower DTR

                 Parameters:
                     Entry:  DX = Port number
                             AL = DTR state to be set (01h = Raise, 00h =
                                  Lower)
     FIDONEWS 14-02               Page 19                  13 Jan 1997


                     Exit:   None

         This function is used to control the DTR line to the modem. AL =
         00h means lower DTR (disable the modem), and AL = 01h means to
         raise DTR (enable the modem).  No other function (except Init)
         should alter DTR.

         AH = 07h    Return timer tick parameters

                 Parameters:
                     Entry:  None
                     Exit:   AL = Timer tick interrupt number
                             AH = Ticks per second on interrupt number in
                                  AL
                             DX = Approximate number of milliseconds per
                                  tick

         This is used to  determine the parameters of the timer tick on any
         given machine.  Three numbers are returned:

             AL =   Timer tick interrupt number
             AH =   Ticks per second on interrupt number shown in AL
             DX =   Milliseconds per tick (approximate)

         Applications can use this for critical timing  (granularity of
         less than one second) or to set up code  (such as a watchdog) that
         is executed on every timer tick. See function 16h (add/delete
         function from timer tick) for the preferred way of actually
         installing such code.

         AH = 08h    Flush output buffer

                 Parameters:
                     Entry:  DX = Port number
                     Exit:   None

         This is used to force any pending output.   It does not return
         until all pending output has been sent.  You should use this call
         with care.  Flow control  (documented below)  can make your system
         hang on this call in a tight uninterruptible loop under the right
         circumstances.

         AH = 09h    Purge output buffer

                 Parameters:
                     Entry:  DX = Port number
                     Exit:   None

         This is used to purge any pending output.   Any output data
         remaining in the output buffer (not transmitted yet) is discarded.

         AH = 0Ah    Purge input buffer

                 Parameters:
                     Entry:  DX = Port number
                     Exit:   None
     FIDONEWS 14-02               Page 20                  13 Jan 1997


         This is used to purge any pending input.   Any input data which is
         still in the buffer is discarded.

         AH = 0Bh    Transmit no wait

                 Parameters:
                     Entry:  DX = Port number
                     Exit:   AX = 0001h - Character was accepted
                                = 0000h - Character was not accepted

         This is exactly the same as the "regular"  transmit call, except
         that if the driver is  unable to  buffer the character  (the
         buffer is full),  a value of 0000h is returned in AX. If the
         driver accepts the character (room is available),  0001h is
         returned in AX.

         AH = 0Ch    Non-destructive read-ahead

                 Parameters:
                     Entry:  DX = Port number
                     Exit:   AH = 00h           - Character is
                             AL = Next character    available
                             AX = FFFFh         - Character is not
                             available

         Return in AL the next character in the receive buffer.  If the
         receive buffer is empty,  return  FFFFh.  The  character  returned
         remains in the receive buffer. Some applications call this "peek".

         AH = 0Dh    Keyboard read without wait

                 Parameters:
                     Entry:  None
                     Exit:   AX = IBM-style scan code (Character available)
                                = FFFFh               (Character not
                                                       available)

         Return in  AX the  next character  (non-destructive read ahead)
         from the keyboard; if nothing is currently in the keyboard buffer,
         return FFFFh in AX.   Use IBM-style  function  key mapping  in the
         high order byte.  Scan codes for non-"function" keys  are not
         specifically required,  but may be included. Function keys return
         00h in AL and the "scan code" in AH.

         AH = 0Eh    Keyboard read with wait

                 Parameters:
                     Entry:  None
                     Exit:   AX = IBM-style scan code

         Return in AX the next character from the keyboard;  wait if no
         character is available. Keyboard mapping should be the same as
         function 0Dh.

         AH = 0Fh    Enable or disable flow control

                 Parameters:
                     Entry:  AL = Bit mask describing requested flow
                                  control
                             DX = Port number
                     Exit:   None

         TRANSMIT flow control allows the "other end" to restrain the
         transmitter when you are  over-running it.  RECEIVE flow control
         tells the FOSSIL to attempt to do just that if it is being
         overwhelmed.

         Two kinds of basic flow control are supported:

                     Bit 0 = 1       Xon/Xoff on transmit
                     Bit 1 = 1       CTS/RTS (CTS on transmit, RTS on
                                              receive)
                     Bit 2           Reserved
     |               Bit 3 = 1       Xon/Xoff on Receive

         Flow control is enabled, or disabled, by setting the appropriate
         bits in AL  for the types of flow control we want to ENABLE (value
         = 1),  and/or DISABLE  (value = 0),  and calling this function.
         Bit 2 is reserved for DSR/DTR,  but is not currently supported in
         any implementation.

         Enabling  transmit  Xon/Xoff will cause the FOSSIL  to stop
         transmitting upon receiving an Xoff.  The FOSSIL will resume
         transmitting when an Xon is received.

         Enabling CTS/RTS will cause the FOSSIL to cease transmitting when
         CTS is lowered.  Transmission will resume  when CTS is raised.
         The FOSSIL will drop RTS when the receive buffer reaches a
         predetermined percentage full The FOSSIL will  raise RTS  when the
         receive buffer  empties below  the predetermined  percentage full.
         The  point(s)  at which  this occurs is left to the individual
         FOSSIL implementor.

     |   Enabling receive  Xon/Xoff will cause the FOSSIL to send a Xoff
     |   when the receive buffer reaches a pre-determined percentage full.
     |   An Xon will be sent when the receive buffer empties below the pre-
     |   determined percentage full. The point(s) at which this occurs is
     |   left to the individual FOSSIL implementor.

         Applications  using this  function  should set all bits  ON  in
         the high nibble of AL as well.  There is a compatible  (but not
         identical) FOSSIL driver implementation that uses the  high nibble
         as a control mask.   If your application sets the high nibble to
         all ones,  it will always work, regardless of the method used by
         any given driver.

         AH = 10h    Extended Control-C / Control-K checking and transmit
                     on/off

                 Parameters:
                     Entry:  AL = Bit mask (see below)
                             DX = Port number
     FIDONEWS 14-02               Page 22                  13 Jan 1997


                     Exit:   AX = 0001h - Control-C/K has been received
                                = 0000h - Control-C/K has not been received

         This is used for BBS  operation,  primarily.  A bit mask is passed
         in AL with the following flags:

                     Bit 0   Enable/disable Control-C / Control-K checking
                     Bit 1   Disable/enable the transmitter

         The Enable (bit 0 = 1) and Disable (Bit 0 = 0) Control-C/Control-K
         check function is meant primarily for BBS use. When the checking
         is enabled, a Control-C or Control-K received  from the
         communications port will set a flag internal to the FOSSIL driver,
         but will not be stored in the input buffer. The next use of this
         function will return the value of this flag in register AX then
         clear the flag for the next occurrence. The returned value is used
         by the BBS  software to determine whether output should be halted
         or not.

         The Disable (Bit 1 = 1) and Enable (Bit 1 = 0) Transmitter
         function lets the application restrain the asynchronous driver
         from output in much the same way as XON/XOFF would.

         AH = 11h    Set current cursor location.

                 Parameters:
                     Entry:  DH = Row (line)
                             DL = Column
                     Exit:   None

         This function looks exactly like like INT 10h, subfunction 2, on
         the IBM PC. The cursor location is passed in DX: row in DH and
         column in DL. The function treats the screen as a coordinate
         system whose origin (0,0) is the upper left hand corner of the
         screen.

         AH = 12h    Read current cursor location.

                 Parameters:
                     Entry:  None
                     Exit:   DH = Row (line)
                             DL = Column

         Looks exactly like INT 10h,  subfunction 3,  on the IBM PC.  The
         current cursor location  (using the same coordinate  system as
         function 16h) is passed back in DX.

         AH = 13h    Single character ANSI write to screen.

                 Parameters:
                     Entry:  AL = Character to display
                     Exit:   None

         The character in AL is sent to the screen by the fastest method
         possible that allows ANSI processing to occur (if available). This
         routine should not be used in such a way that DOS output  (which
     FIDONEWS 14-02               Page 23                  13 Jan 1997


         is not re-entrant) can not be employed by some FOSSIL driver to
         perform the function  (in fact, on the IBM PC that is likely to be
         how it's done).  On some systems such as the DEC Rainbow this will
         be a very fast method of screen writing.

         AH = 14h    Enable or disable watchdog processing

                 Parameters:
                     Entry:  AL = 01h - Enable watchdog
                                = 00h - Disable watchdog
                             DX = Port number
                     Exit:   None

         When watchdog is enabled,   the state of the carrier detect (CD)
         line on the comm port specified in DX should be constantly
         monitored. Should the state of that line become FALSE (carrier
         lost), the system should be re-booted, to enable the BBS (or other
         application) to start up again. This monitor is not affected by
         Init/Uninit etc.

         AH = 15h    Write character to screen using BIOS support routines

                 Parameters:
                     Entry:  AL = Character to display
                     Exit:   None

         The character in AL is sent to the screen using  BIOS-level
         Input/Output routines. This differs from function 13h in that DOS
         I/O CAN NOT be used, as this function might be called from driver
         level.

         AH = 16h    Insert or delete a function from the timer tick chain

                 Parameter:
                     Entry:  AL = 01h - Add a function
                                = 00h - Delete a function
     |                       ES = Segment of function
                             DX = Offset of function
                     Exit:   AX = 0000h - Operation successful
                                = FFFFh - Operation unsuccessful

         This function is used to allow a  central authority  to manage the
         timer interrupts, so that as code is loaded and unloaded, the
         integrity of the "chain" is not compromised.  Rather than using
         the traditional method of saving the old contents of the timer
         vector, storing the address of your routine there,  and executing
         a far call to the "old" routine when yours is done, instead you
         call this function. It manages a list of such entry points and
         calls them on a timer tick (interrupt) using a FAR call.  All the
         usual cautions about making DOS calls apply (that is, DON'T!).

         This makes it possible for a program to get in and out of the tick
         chain without having to know whether another program has also done
         so since it first insinuated itself.   At least 4 entries should
         be available in the driver's table (including one to be used by
         Watchdog if implemented that way).

         AH = 17h    Reboot system

                 Parameters:
                     Entry:  AL = 00h - "Cold boot"
                                = 01h - "Warm boot"

         Perform the old 3-finger salute.  Used in extreme emergency by
         code that can't seem to find a "clean" way out of the trouble it
         has gotten itself into.  Hopefully it won't happen while you're
         computing something in the other half of a DoubleDOS system. If
         your machine can make a distinction between a "cold" (power-up,
         self-test and boot) and a "warm" (just boot) bootstrap,  your
         FOSSIL should support the flag in AL. Otherwise just do whatever
         bootstrap is possible.

     |   AH = 18h    Read block (transfer from FOSSIL to user buffer)

     |           Parameters:
     |               Entry:  CX = Maximum number of characters to transfer
     |                       DX = Port number
     |                       ES = Segment of user buffer
     |                       DI = Offset into ES of user buffer
     |               Exit:   AX = Number of characters actually transferred

     |   A "no-wait"  block read of 0 to FFFFh characters from the FOSSIL
     |   inbound ring buffer to the calling routine's buffer. ES:DI are
     |   left unchanged by the call; the count of bytes actually
     |   transferred will be returned in AX.

     |   AH = 19h    Write block (transfer from user buffer to FOSSIL)

     |           Parameters:
     |               Entry:  CX = Maximum number of characters to transfer
     |                       DX = Port number
     |                       ES = Segment of user buffer
     |                       DI = Offset into ES of user buffer
     |               Exit:   AX = Number of characters actually transferred


     |   A  "no-wait"  block  move of 0  to FFFFh  characters  from  the
     |   calling program's  buffer into  the  FOSSIL outbound ring buffer.
     |   ES:DI are left unchanged by the call;  the count of bytes actually
     |   transferred will be returned in AX.

     |   AH = 1Ah    Break begin or end

     |           Parameters:
     |               Entry:  AL = 01h - Start sending 'break'
                                = 00h - Stop sending 'break'
     |                       DX = port number
     |               Exit:   None

     |   Send a break signal to the modem. If AL=01h the driver will
     |   commence the transmission of a break.  If AL=00h the driver will
     |   end the break.  This is useful for communications with devices
     |   that can only go into 'command mode' when a BREAK is received.
     FIDONEWS 14-02               Page 25                  13 Jan 1997


     |   Note: the application is responsible for the timing of the BREAK.
     |   Also,  if the FOSSIL has been restrained by an Xoff received from
     |   the modem, the flag will be cleared.   An Init or Un-Init will
     |   stop an in-progress BREAK.

     |   AH = 1Bh    Return information about the driver

     |           Parameters:
     |               Entry:  CX = Size of user info buffer in bytes
     |                       DX = Port number
     |                       ES = Segment of user info buffer
     |                       DI = Offset into ES of user info buffer
     |               Exit:   AX = Number of bytes actually transferred

     |   Transfer information about the driver and its current status to
     |   the user for use in determining,  at the application level, limits
     |   of the driver.  Designed to assist  "generic" applications  to
     |   adjust to "foreign" gear.

     |   The data structure currently returned by the driver is as follows
     |   (sorry but you'll have to live with assembly syntax):

     |       info    equ     $               ; define begin of structure
     |       strsiz  dw      info_size       ; size of the structure in
     |                                         bytes
     |       majver  db      curr_fossil     ; FOSSIL spec driver conforms
     |                                         to
     |       minver  db      curr_rev        ; rev level of this specific
     |                                         driver
     |       ident   dd      id_string       ; "FAR" pointer to ASCII ID
     |                                         string
     |       ibufr   dw      ibsize          ; size of the input buffer
     |                                         (bytes)
     |       ifree   dw      ?               ; number of bytes left in
     |                                         buffer
     |       obufr   dw      obsize          ; size of the output buffer
     |                                         (bytes)
     |       ofree   dw      ?               ; number of bytes left in the
     |                                         buffer
     |       swidth  db      screen_width    ; width of screen on this
     |                                         adapter
     |       sheight db      screen_height   ; height of screen    "     "
     |       baud    db      ?               ; ACTUAL baud rate, computer
     |                                         to modem
     |       info_size equ $-info

     |   The ident string should be null-terminated, and NOT contain a
     |   newline. The baud rate byte contains the bits that  Function 00h
     |   would use to set the port to that speed.

     |   The fields related to a particular port (buffer size, space left
     |   in the buffer, baud rate) will be undefined if port FFh  or an
     |   invalid port is contained in DX.

     |   Additional information will always be passed after these, so that,
     |   for example, offset "sheight" will never change with FOSSIL
     FIDONEWS 14-02               Page 26                  13 Jan 1997


     |   revision changes.

     |   The functions below are not necessarily FOSSIL related. However,
     |   because dispatchers that support them are hooked on Interrupt 14H,
     |   it behooves the FOSSIL developer to support them as well to avoid
     |   fragmenting memory with several dispatchers.

     |   AH = 7Eh    Install an "external application" function

     |           Parameters:
     |               Entry:  AL = Code assigned to external application
     |                       DX = Offset of application entry point
     |                       ES = Segment of application entry point
     |               Exit:   AX = 1954h
     |                       BL = Code assigned to application (same as
     |                            input AL)
     |                       BH = 01h - Installation was successful
     |                          = 00h - Installation failed

     |   This call is used by external application code  (special screen
     |   drivers, modem code, database code, etc) to link into the INT 14h
     |   service for use by multiple applications. The "error return" (BH=0
     |   with AX=1954h) should mean that  another application layer has
     |   already been installed at that particular code. Codes 80h through
     |   BFh should be supported.

     |   External application codes 80h-83h are  reserved by FOSSIL
     |   developers for re-organizing FOSSIL services by type (comm,
     |   screen, keyboard, system).

     |   Installed application code will be entered, via a FAR call, from
     |   the INT 14H dispatcher whenever it is entered with AH=(application
     |   code).

     |   If the value returned in AX from this function is not 1954h, the
     |   service code that is trying to be installed should bring up its
     |   own INT 14h code that can service INT 14h functions 7h-BFh (80h-
     |   BFh are "applications").

     |   AH = 7Fh    Remove an "external application" function

     |           Parameters:
     |               Entry:  AL = Code assigned to external application
     |                       DX = Offset of application entry point
     |                       ES = Segment of application entry point
     |               Exit:   AX = 1954h
     |                       BL = Code assigned to application (same as
     |                            input AL)
     |                       BH = 01h - Removal was successful
     |                          = 00h - Removal failed

     |   Removes an application's entry into the table.  Usually so it can
     |   remove itself from memory. Error return means ES:DX did not match
     |   or that there is no entry at the slot described by AL.

     |   An application that wants to remove itself from memory can issue
     FIDONEWS 14-02               Page 27                  13 Jan 1997


     |   the 7F function to remove itself from the table, then, if it is
     |   successful, get out of memory. If it had to install itself with an
     |   INT 14h dispatcher it may back itself out, provided no other
     |   applications  have been installed on top of it (using its
     |   dispatcher).

     E.  Validation Suite.

         Well, there is one, but it's involved.   Here is a list of
         software that is known to use FOSSIL calls,  and the range of
         calls used by that software:

             Software package                        Fossil calls used

         Fido,  V11w,  generic version                  00h - 07h
         SEAdog,  V4.1b                                 00h - 0Eh
         Opus,  V1.03a                                  00h - 17h
         BinkleyTerm,  V1.30                            00h - 1Bh

         While  there is  certainly no  guarantee that your FOSSIL is bug-
         free if all the above software runs  with it,  you  have probably
         done as  much as you  can in  a test environment if your FOSSIL is
         tested with each of these packages.

      F. Technical Discussion.

         A FOSSIL echomail conference exists,  for the purpose of
         exchanging info and implementation details for FOSSIL drivers.  It
         is coordinated by Ray Gwinn at FidoNet node 1:109/639.  Contact
         him for details on how to join.  Keep in mind though,  that this
         conference is intended  SPECIFICALLY for implementors of FOSSIL
         software and not as a general Q&A conference for people who think
         FOSSILs have something to do with paleontology.

                            FidoNet mail session startup
                                         by
                               Bob Hartman, 1:132/101

          Presently, FSC001  contains no  provisions for  what actually
     FIDONEWS 14-02               Page 28                  13 Jan 1997


     happens when a  call is received.  All it says is that the baud rate
     is determined, and a netmail session starts.  Currently, this is one
     of the most difficult sections of  a netmail program to get working.
     All programs have different timeouts, different ways of determining
     baud rates, not to mention the fact that MNP  modems talking  to non-
     MNP  modems can cause problems.  For these reasons, I  propose the
     following "standard" for netmail programs that deal with the beginning
     of a netmail session:

     1. When carrier is detected, all input should be deleted by the
          receiver for a period of 2 seconds (I would even be comfortable
          with 5 seconds, but it  makes human  callers a  bit unhappy).
          This  enables most MNP modems to  send their  string of  MNP
          "garbage" and not cause spurious characters to impact the netmail
          startup logic.

     2. The sender should send ONLY carriage return and space characters as
          "whacking return" until the receiver acknowledges by sending a
          string containing a carriage return or space character.

     3. The  sender should whack return at the rate of one character per
          second. This gives Fido 11w and other implementations time to
          purge buffers if line noise is received which would screw up the
          baud rate detection logic.

     4. After  recognizing the "whack" of the sender, the receiver should
          disregard all characters except the following:

          TSYNC -  start of  an FSC001  session (a  delay of at least one
               second should appear  here so  the sender  can recognize  a
               valid  NAK -otherwise, it  could still  be the  banner file
               being displayed).  WaZOO mailers  should disregard the first
               TSYNC in the hopes that a YooHoo  will appear.   If  a
               YooHoo  is not  received within  2 seconds, or  a second
               TSYNC appears, an FSC001 session should be started.

          YooHoo - signals the start of a WaZOO netmail session.  FSC001
               mailers should just ignore this character as noise.

          Carriage return,  space -  Send  message  containing  carriage
               return and/or space.   The  sender may  have missed  it the
               first time around and is still "whacking return".

          Line feed  - This  is probably a user, and a message explaining
               things to him/her should be sent out.

          Escape - This character is currently used by at least one front
               end as a quick  method for users to enter the BBS.  If
               received in "mail mode", it should always  be ignored.
               (I  propose this as a "standard" so that all front-ends can
               use this feature.  If it is not standardized now, all front-
               ends could conceivably use different characters and further
               muddle the picture when a netmail session is starting.)

     5. After  the sender has started sending TSYNC and/or YooHoo, the
          responses must be  looked at  very carefully.   A  line with  no
     FIDONEWS 14-02               Page 29                  13 Jan 1997


          activity for at least .5  seconds must  be seen.   Otherwise,  it
          is  possible that  a banner file is still being displayed and a
          'C' is meaningless.

          If  all   FidoNet  compatible  mail  programs  were  to  follow
     these conventions, I  believe that  the start  of a netmail session
     would be much more reliable  than it  is right  now.  Too often we see
     front end packages fall through  to the  underlying BBS because of MNP
     negotiation, or one end taking longer than the other to give a connect
     message.

     What is intended by this document registry

     o Starting a document archive with a naming convention based  on the
       current one, FSC-nnnn.ARC.

     o The first few documents are the current FSC001 & 2, but using the
       new naming convention.

     o Grabbing the dozen documents which detail the current FidoNet
       technology (MYFSC001, N_YOOHOO, ...) , or provide well-documented
       proposals for changes, arranging them in date order without
       prejudice and issuing them numbers.

     The ongoing plan is

     o Similarly to the NIC, when a document is revised, it is given a new
       number, and states what documents it obsoletes.  Many have said that
       this should have been done with FSC001.

     o Occasional documents will provide bibliographies of the archive.

     o Occasional documents will give advice as to which subset of the
       registry represents the currently accepted standard.

     o Contributions hungrily accepted.  Send text<tm>.

     Naming Convention

     1. Document names begin with "FSC-nnnn".

     2. Documents are numbered sequentially from 0001, with new document
        numbers being assigned to new drafts.

     3. Extensions are
        a) .ARC - The distributed ARChive file
        b) .TXT - ASCII text file for screen or printer
        c) .DOC - ASCII text file for screen or printer
        d) .CHT - ASCII chart, may be wide or long or both

        I Shot A Query Into The Net

        I shot a query into the net.
        I haven't got an answer yet,
        But seven people gave me hell
        And said I ought to learn to spell;

        A posted message called me rotten
        For ignoring mail I'd never gotten;
        An angry message asked me, Please
        Don't send such drivel overseas;

        A lawyer sent me private mail
        And swore he'd slap my ass in jail --
        I'd mentioned Un*x in my gem
        And failed to add the T and M;

        One netter thought it was a hoax:
        "Hereafter, post to net dot jokes!";
        Another called my grammar vile
        And criticized my writing style.

        Each day I scan each Subject line
        In hopes the topic will be mine;
        I shot a query into the net.
        I haven't got an answer yet ...

     Latest Greatest Software Versions
     by Peter E. Popovich, 1:363/264

     Wow. I must've had way too much free time this week, because I've
     actually made some headway into my backlog.

     I even got info from Bob Juge about BinkleyTerm. In addition to
     having the files available for FREQ, he also has them for ftp.
     For those of you who think un URLs, ftp://juge.com/bbs   ;-)

     Also, folks who do any post-prosseing on this list should be aware;
     I've "stolen" two characters from the Version column and given them
     to the Magic Name column so I could support 8.3 file names.

     Phased out this week: Socrates 1.11 and SuperBBS 1.12

     Phase-out highlights:
       This week: TBBS 2.1 and TComm/TCommNet 3.4
             Deadline for info: 24 Jan 1997.
       Last week: SuperComm 0.99 and TAG 2.5g
             Deadline for info: 17 Jan 1997.
