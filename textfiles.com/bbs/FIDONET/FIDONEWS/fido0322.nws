                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================

     This week's guest editorial is by Peter de Jager of 148/103.

                          The Right to Information


     Greetings FidoWorld!  The editorial in FidoNews volume 3,  number
     17 has prompted this response.

     The question has been asked, "Do we have a right to information?"
     That is to say,  "is someone immoral if they withhold information
     from me?" I have heard the argument  that  information  does  not
     "belong"  to  anyone and therefore should be accessible to all at
     no cost.  I disagree.

     Firstly,  "information" is a result of data having been processed
     in  some  fashion.  This  processing  of  data  into information,
     requires energy,  therefore it is  not  free;  there  is  a  cost
     involved in its production.

     Secondly,  even the raw material,  data, is not free.  There is a
     cost to collect and store it.  Try to collect any datum  and  you
     will  find that you must make some effort to do so.  For example,
     taking the air temperature (available to  to  everyone)  requires
     the use of a thermometer, and time to take the reading.

     Thirdly,  assuming  that nobody is currently collecting the data,
     nobody is pointing a moral finger at someone else stating "It  is
     your moral duty to collect and analyze,  in case it might provide
     a solution." Nor is there a hue and cry about the fact  that  the
     data  is  expensive to collect.  After all,  the cost of the data
     collection is dictated not by some greedy individual,  but by the
     rules of nature.

     So to tie this back to the editorial, the first example given was
     of  a  private  weather  bureau that has deduced the arrival of a
     hurricane through its own efforts.  Only its subscribers now know
     about the danger and  many  other  people  die  due  to  lack  of
     knowledge.  Is  the  company  responsible for those deaths in any
     fashion?

     No!

     My reasoning is:

     a) That the raw data was available to all those that could afford
        it.  Granted the raw data cost is high, but the bureau did not
        set that price!  It was set by nature;  no one is  responsible
        for the high cost, therefore no one is to blame.

     b) The information was available to all persons that either:

        1) Collected/analyzed  the data themselves,  and paid the high
     Fidonews                     Page 3                    9 Jun 1986


           cost to do so, or

        2) Paid the Bureau a subscription fee,  which  would  be  much
           less than the costs involved in (1).

     In  other  words,  the  bureau has provided you a FREE service by
     giving you an additional option!  You now have a choice!  Pay the
     high cost set by nature OR the lower cost made  possible  by  the
     activity of the bureau.

     To  now  claim that the bureau is now somehow responsible for the
     death of people that chose not to,  or could not,  pay the  lower
     price  is  worse than ludicrous.  By increasing our options,  the
     bureau has made our life better, not worse!  To inflict them with
     some form of moral obligation  is  punishing  them  for  being  a
     service to us!  Since when has excelling become a crime?

     To  impose  this  moral  obligation  on any type of activity will
     hinder its growth, to our continued detriment!  Sadly, this logic
     will not prevent the "takers" of the world  from  imposing  these
     types  of  rules  on  the  "makers".  There  are many things that
     happen in this  world  because  someone  is  willing  to  take  a
     personal risk, then there are those that would lay claim to those
     efforts  based  on their "need".  Perhaps one day the makers will
     decide it is no longer  worth  the  effort...  and  shrug...  and
     strike...  to  protect their efforts from the thieves and mooches
     of  the  world  that  contribute  nothing  but  wish  to  inherit
     everything;  because  they "need" it,  not because they've earned
     it.

                                 Yours in frustration,
                                 Peter de Jager

                         EchoMail and Host Routing
                             A Plea for Sanity


     This isn't really my argument to make; I don't run a Host or even
     a Hub. However, I am participating in one EchoMail with about six
     other boards:  the  MAGICK  conference.  And  we  have  had  some
     disagreements  regarding  topology  and routing,  so I'm bringing
     this up for general discussion and response here.

     There is a very strong argument to be made for NEVER HOST ROUTING
     ECHOMAIL.  There is only one argument in _favor_ of host  routing
     EchoMail;  convenience  (you  don't  have to do ANYTHING).  But a
     moment's reflection will show the problems in host-routing. First
     and foremost,  the net topology and routing structure was set  up
     for  irregular but small mail loads.  In normal use,  without the
     repetitive load that EchoMail imposes,  a host/hub does not  have
     to  bear  a  grossly  huge  load,  just  a  normally  large load.
     EchoMail, on the other hand, demands repetition of messages.  So,
     if   my  board  were  to  host-route,   and  (as  the  conference
     coordinator wanted) all of us  on  the  conference  sent  to  all
     others,  my  board  would  generate  maybe  60 messages on a busy
     night, divided between 5 recipients.  What's worse, the growth is
     at  least  quadratic,  possibly  exponential.  Such a load on the
     hosts is unfair and improper,  and  impedes  the  usual  flow  of
     regular  mail:  which  is  supposed  to  be  the  host's  primary
     responsibility.

     Another argument in this vein  is  that  the  hosting  system  is
     designed  for  a  loosely-linked  system,  so that the individual
     board doesn't need any knowledge of the remote boards  schedules.
     However,  in an EchoMail topology, each board is cooperating with
     its EchoMail neighbors,  so a  direct  tightly-linked  system  is
     possible (and can be more timely).

     I  would  like  to  recommend  that  host-routing  of EchoMail be
     treated as a capital offense:  the offender should be  doghoused.
     This  seems  to be the trend;  I caught hell from the Pack Leader
     from the start, and got wise quick.  (Arf!) Some hosts are not as
     sure  of  their  rights  and  obligations,  and are continuing to
     encourage this questionable practice (or at least,  allow it.)  A
     general policy would clear things up.

     Well,  while I'm at it,  I'd like to invite any interested boards
     into the MAGICK conference.  The past few weeks have seen serious
     (and not so serious) discussions on Paganism & Tolerance,  Heresy
     (and Rumors of Heresy), Ritual vs. the Party Mentality, Political
     Alerts (there's an obnoxious bill in the  House  Ways  and  Means
     Committee  that  would  ban  tax  exemptions  from "organizations
     having an interest in witchcraft"),  and other interesting stuff.

     Matt Gertner, 141/320

     I have just released a fourth  version  of  Fidodate,  a  program
     which adds dates to the FILES.BBS file. The dates (thanks to Bill
     Thomas  of  SeaCoast  Fido)  are  added in the format mm-dd-yy in
     front of the file description. For example, the line:

         FDATE43.ARC Version 4.3 of FIDODATE

     Would be changed to:

         FDATE43.ARC 05-18-86 Version 4.3 of FIDODATE

     If a description + date is too long,  the  user  is  prompted  to
     enter a shorter description.  In addition, the date of the newest
     file is added to the DIR.BBS file (allowing users  to  scan  with
     the  'a' command to see which of the file areas have received new
     files  since  their  last  call).   FIDODATE  can  also  be   run
     automatically  from  a batch file.  The program is public domain,
     with a requested donation of $10-20, and it is available from the
     Fido mentioned above (I unfortunately don't have the cash to mail
     it out to any number of people).  Source code is supplied. I hope
     this program will be of use to someone.

     MINUTES - Cincinnati Area Fido Sysop Meeting - May 16, 1986
     Allen Miller 108/10


     May 16, 1986 - We had the first Fido Sysop's get together for the
     Cincinnati area Fido's.  A rather informal affair, it was held at
     Mr.  T's, a pizza parlor in Western Hills,  Cincinnati.  If I can
     speak  for the group,  I would say a rather pleasant time was had
     by all.

     The first order of business was introductions, because other than
     one or two for each of us, every face was a new one.  We had nine
     sysop's in attendance,  seven from Cincinnati one one  each  from
     Fairborn and Sydney.

     After  the  introductions we moved on to the next important order
     of business, pizzas, hoagies and beer.

     Before,  during,  and after the food (and beverages) we had  some
     very helpful discussions.  Often times there were two or three of
     these  discussions  going  on  at the same time so I really can't
     comment on all of them.

     - Some of the sysops discussed problems with users that spend  an
       inordinate  amount of time downloading and those that insist on
       leaving messages using foul language.  Preregistration,  Fido's
       time  parameters  and  orientation  of  the  Fido  system  were
       discussed as ways to limit these activities.

     - Announcement was made that only  the  NODEDIFF  files  will  be
       distributed  automatically  in  the  local area.  File transfer
       time was cited as the reason for  this  change.  Sysops  should
       get XLATRGEN or LISTGEN utility to merge the NODEDIFF file with
       the prior week's NODELIST.nnn file.

     - General  use  of the Sysop "0" command and the O)utside command
       were discussed, along with the OUTSIDE utility program.  Sample
       .BAT files were distributed illustrating structure for invoking
       these functions with security  of  the  WATCHDOG  utility.  One
       sysop  expressed  interest  in finding a generalized utility to
       allow full screen video applications to run well in the Outside
       environment.

     - Several Fido operation problems  were  discussed  and  resolved
       either at the meeting or after.  One problem involved the "disk
       full" error message generated when trying to enter messages and
       was  found  to  be  caused  by  not  having  the  FILES=20  and
       BUFFERS=50 statements in the CONFIG.SYS file.  A  question  was
       also  raised  on  how  to  upload  *.* to Fido.  Allen Miller's
       solution is to use Telink protocol in a program such as PIBTERM
       and enter the command U TC X to Fido, and then *.* to PIBTERM's
       request for a filename.

     - Use of .BAT  files  along  with  Fido's  event  scheduler  were
       discussed  as  an  effective means of performing regular system
       maintenance functions.  Samples were  distributed.  One  of  my
     Fidonews                     Page 10                   9 Jun 1986


       favorite  items  is  to  use COMMAND /C filename.BAT to have my
       RUNBBS.BAT file  execute  its  external  event  by  calling  an
       external  .BAT  file  and  allowing  the event statements to be
       maintained in a separate file.  When the  event  .BAT  file  is
       completed, control is returned to the calling .BAT file.

     Announcing the Official GAGS Game Contest       May 26, 1986
     -----------------------------------------       ------------

     Users of the Generic Adventure Game  System  (GAGS)  now  have  a
     chance  to enhance their reputations and income by writing a game
     using GAGS.

     The author of the best game submitted to the Official  GAGS  Game
     Contest  will  receive  $100 or 100 floppy disks,  and his or her
     game will be included with all copies of  GAGS  for  at  least  a
     year.  Depending  on  the  number  and quality of entries,  other
     entries showing merit may receive Honorable  Mentions  and  token
     prizes of some kind.


     GUIDELINES FOR SUBMISSIONS:

     To  be  considered  for  the  contest,  your  game must work with
     version 1.06a or later of the Generic Adventure Game System.

     The game should be playable (i.e.  it  must  be  possible  for  a
     reasonable  player  to complete it in less than 5 years,  and not
     require that the player save the game status before every  step).
     Please  realize  that  the line between cleverness and cruelty in
     game design is a fine one.

     The winning game need  not  use  the  standard  "adventure  game"
     format;  any  interesting  and  enjoyable script for GAGS will be
     considered for the contest.  It  is  not  necessary  to  use  any
     particular  feature  of  GAGS,  and  the  game can be as large or
     small, or as simple or complex, as you feel appropriate.

     Games which rely  on  IBM-specific  features  (such  as  the  IBM
     graphics  character set) will be considered,  but games requiring
     specific  features  of  other  computer  systems  will   not   be
     considered.

     Keep  your  game clean.  If your game were a movie,  it should be
     rated PG-13 at the worst,  since GAGS is aimed at a wide audience
     including pre-teens.  It should not contain explicit or offensive
     language,  and should certainly not require obscene or  offensive
     behavior on the part of the player.

     The  game  should  not  infringe upon any copyrighted material or
     upon any trademarks.  In other words,  while you are  welcome  to
     base  your  game  upon  a fantasy-role-playing environment,  or a
     space  travel  scenario,   you  cannot  legally  use  names  like
     "Dungeons  and  Dragons"  or  "Star  Trek,"  which are registered
     trademarks.  It might be acceptable to use modified trademarks if
     the game is a deliberate satire. All text must be original to the
     game author(s), who must own all copyrights to the game.

     Entries may be written by an individual,  a team, or, if desired,
     by an artificially-intelligent computer program.

     PRIZES:

     The author of the best game submitted by September 30,  1986 will
     receive  his  or  her  choice  of a check for $100 or 100 double-
     sided,  double-density floppy disks for the IBM PC.  Depending on
     the number of entries and the disposition of the judge(s),  other
     prizes may also be awarded,  either as additional prizes for  the
     author  of  the  best  game or as less valuable prizes awarded to
     games considered worthy of an Honorable Mention.


     RULES:

     No purchase is necessary:  You need not be a registered  user  to
     enter  the Official GAGS Game Contest,  and registered users will
     have no advantage in the contest.

     All entries should comply with  the  Guidelines  for  Submissions
     listed above.

     The  winner of the contest will be the game that,  in the opinion
     of the judge(s),  is most interesting and enjoyable to  use.  The
     contest  will  be  judged  by  Mark J.  Welch,  or by one or more
     person(s) chosen by him to judge the contest.  All  decisions  of
     the judge(s) will be final.

     The  winning  game  file will be included with all copies of GAGS
     distributed by the author from October 31,  1986 to  October  31,
     1987,  and  possibly thereafter.  Other than the $100 prize,  the
     winner will receive  no  additional  compensation  from  Mark  J.
     Welch;  however,  the  winning  game  may  include  a "shareware"
     contribution request within the game itself. The winning game may
     be edited for style and grammar before release.

     All entries may be individually copyrighted by their authors, and
     may be distributed as "shareware" or  as  "public  domain"  works
     independent of the Official GAGS Game Contest.  Entries which are
     copyrighted and distributed  as  "shareware"  by  their  authors,
     including  the  winning  submission  if appropriate,  may include
     requests for contributions to their authors.

     Submissions should be sent as an ASCII text file, on a 5-1/4 inch
     floppy disk,  formatted for use with an  IBM  Personal  Computer.
     Entries which include a return mailer and sufficient postage will
     be returned; no other submissions will be returned.

     All submissions must be mailed to Mark J.  Welch, P.O.  Box 2409,
     San Francisco,  CA 94126.  All submissions must be postmarked  by
     September 30, 1986, and must be received by October 10, 1986. The
     winner  of the contest will be announced on or before October 31,
     1986.

     Charles Wallace, 13/999

                        Help a Lost Dog Find His Way


     I am the SYSOP of the LOST DOG FIDO  in  Cape  May,  N.J.  and  I
     propose  that  perhaps  the FIDO sysops,  working together can do
     what seemingly can't be done otherwise:

     I priced a "good" brand of GENERIC PC with COLOR  monitor  and  a
     20-Mbyte HD,  5151 Keyboard,  serial,  parallel,C/G,  etc and the
     total price (with 1 year guarentee) was under $2,000.00

     Now I know that Tom Jennings  is  off-line  because  of  a  "disk
     crash"  and that he is "re-building" a system,  but I'm sure that
     the guy is busy.  And he has to work for a  living,  (so  say  we
     all!!).  Now,  I like and use the FIDO system,  got a lot of good
     stuff and met a few nice folks,  try  to  upload  my  share,  and
     frankly, if I had two grand in loose cash, I'd personally send TJ
     a  new  computer.  But if you think about it the way I've thought
     about it, you'd realize that it ain't the money.

     So, to make a long story short, here is what I propose:

     the LOST DOG FUND, c/o IFNA in St. Louis.
         contributors? All interested FIDOUSERS.
         how much?     NO DONATION OVER $5.00!!!

     and we will get TJ back on-line.....

     WHY ONLY $5.00, because there are about 800 nodes in the U.S. amd
     Canada,  plus UNTOLD numbers of fidousers and  if  just  1/2  the
     SYSOPS gave, then we could get TJ his system.  I spoke to the guy
     I get computers from and told him about  it,  he  said  that  for
     however much we collect, he will sell us the MOST SYSTEM with the
     MOST  MEMORY  and DRIVES that our $$$ add up to,  and AT HIS COST
     plus shipping to San Francisco.

     So, we have a dealer who also has a heart, we have $2,000 plus to
     raise, and we have 800 plus contributors to ask.  And WHILE WE'RE
     AT  IT...  if  you  want  to send MORE than $5.00,  then make the
     difference out to the IFNA fellows who do great work for  no  pay
     and little thanks.  Remember,  a FIDO, by itself, is just another
     bulletin board,  and even THAT wouldn't run without the  work  TJ
     did.

     From: Survival Communication Forum, Santa Rosa, CA
           Sysop: Don Kulha, #125/7, BBS: 707-545-0746


          Howdy Folks! I'd like to take a moment here via the FidoNews
     to say hello and introduce our system,  SCF.  Our aim with SCF is
     to   serve   the  members  of  the  survivalist  community  as  a
     communications medium and  spread  the  word  on  the  merits  of
     preparedness to the public at large. We survivalists generally do
     not  fit the media stereotypes you usually see,  indeed may of us
     do not even refer to ourselves as such.  Generally  speaking  our
     goal  is to be prepared for natural and manmade disasters,  along
     with the common day to day  type  of  emergencies,  which  really
     seems prudent doesn't it?

          SCF  has been in continuous operation since January of 1985.
     The system was converted to FIDO about a month ago and we  joined
     the  net as 125/7 just recently.  Our Forum has 15 file areas and
     16  conferences.   Some  of  the  topics  are:   Medicine,  Radio
     Communications,  Independent Energy Systems,  Weaponscraft, Food,
     and  Finance.   We  also  have   hosted   discussion   areas   on
     radio/alternative  energy  and  Survival Viehicle maintenance and
     modification,  plus an online interactive  version  of  the  Game
     "Diplomacy"  to  sharpen  ones  bargaining  skills.  Our Forum is
     constantly changing and growing and you are most welcome to  join
     in  or  stop  by  for  a visit.  We also have a "sister" survival
     system on the East coast,  just getting started,  called  SURCOMM
     which  operates  9pm-8am  EST  at 703-249-5085 (soon to be in the
     net).

          I'd like  to  take  a  moment  here  to  thank  the  Network
     Administrators,  Tom J.  and all of the system operators who have
     built and nurtured the net-without you  we  would  not  have  the
     opportunity  to  join in this truly amazing thing you've spawned.
     I've also been amazed at the open, friendly and helpful manner of
     all the Fido sysops I've contacted,  it's a great feeling to be a
     part  of  this  family.  Special thanks to Butch Walker and Bruce
     Ong.

     =================================================================

                             Notes from Abroad


     The modem situation in Europe is very complicated and from Fido's
     point of view much worse then in  the  USA.  V21  and  V23  seems
     fairly  standard,  with  v22 and v22bis modems coming but at high
     prices yet.  Most of your callers will use v21 (300/300 baud)  or
     v23 (1200/75 baud).  If your Fido must serve them your modem must
     autoselect  between  the two modes and adjust accordingly.  There
     the problems arise, most of these so called "dual standard" types
     are incompatible with each other, effectively preventing the mail
     between Fido's while manual  callers  don't  have  any  problems.
     Also  so-called  "Hayes emulators" with v21 and v23 are not quite
     Hayes  (yet)  giving  more  problems  with  the   European   mail
     situation.

     Because  of  these  technical  differences  mailing to some other
     European Fido is quite a jump into the  deep  and  connection  to
     some  Fido's  will  even  be  impossible  to  make.  To cure this
     situation we are strongly supporting the  national  host  scheme,
     with  hosts  taking  care of international mail for the Fido's in
     his/her country.  Between national hosts and between  Europe  and
     the  USA  we  have agreed upon the v22bis system as the standard.
     At the moment Fido's 3101 and 4403 the national hosts for Holland
     and the UK are able to send/receive mail on  this  standard  with
     4601 and 4701 following shortly.  Sending your international mail
     through  this  hosts will costs you less because messages will be
     packed and send at a high baud rate.  There  is  some  accounting
     involved here,  mostly the national host will require you to send
     some money in advance and will deduct the actual  transfers  from
     your  account.  You must contact your national host about this if
     you wish to use this system.  Note  that  for  sending  files  to
     another  country  this  routing will not work and you must either
     play your hand and try to send  it,  or  send  the  file  between
     country hosts.

     Also  there  is  now  a  possibility  that  you  can mail WITHOUT
     actually having a Hayes compatible modem.  You must  request  the
     host to poll you every night and PICKUP your mail.  A simple auto
     answer  modem is then sufficient and the scheme is also very cost
     efficient if you have mail beyond  an  occasional  message  every
     month.  Please  contact  your  country  manager if you wish to be
     "polled".

     In  order  to  accommodate  for  all  kind  of  modems,   and  to
     accommodate  for the mail "pickup" and "distribution" slots,  the
     European time slot must shift to an earlier  hour  to  avoid  the
     distribution slot winding up in high rate hours in, for instance,
     Finland.  Also  some  early  birds  calling  in  will jump in the
     middle of a mail slot.

                           THE WORLD OF COMPUTING
                        written by Reuven M. Lerner
                              FidoMail 107/233


         It's  been  hectic for me these last few weeks.  With a cold,
     several article deadlines,  and Passover,  there has never been a
     better time for me to speak about multitasking on microcomputers.

         For those of you who don't know,  multitasking is the ability
     to do several things at the same time.  For instance,  if my  DEC
     VT180  was  multitasking,  I could not only do what I'm doing now
     and write this column,  but I could  also  compile  my  last  big
     program.  Mainframes  and  minicomputers  both use multitasking a
     great deal; it's only been very recently that micros have had the
     power to do it.

         One of  the  best-known  (and  best  loved/hated)  multiuser,
     multitasking  operating systems is UNIX.  Developed by Bell Labs,
     it allowed one person to do more than one thing at  a  time,  for
     many  different  users.  There  were  several problems with UNIX,
     though, that restricted its use on micros.

         Memory and storage were the biggest  problem.  The  UNIX  PC,
     put out by AT&T, has a 10-megabyte drive that has nearly one-half
     of its capacity used up just holding the operating system.  Those
     of  us  who  use  CP/M  or  MS-DOS know that the operating system
     usually takes up a negligible 4-20K. 5 megabytes is a little much
     to ask for out of a company that  is  experimenting  with  a  new
     operating system!

         Another  big  problem  of  UNIX  is  that it is what could be
     termed "user-hostile",  being as far away from  user-friendly  as
     possible.  I've never used it myself,  but the different articles
     and books that give examples tell me that most businessmen aren't
     going to want to sit down and learn strange commands just to find
     out what files are on the disk.

         Using Topview and Microsoft  Windows  as  examples,  we  have
     today  limited multitasking for microcomputers.  Both can be used
     on any IBM machine,  but are  used  best  on  the  AT,  with  its
     increased  speed  (now 8MHz,  over 4.77MHz for the PC and XT) and
     better graphics.  The biggest problem, again,  though,  just like
     UNIX, is memory and storage.

         As Personal Computing magazine pointed out in their review of
     Topview,  they  could easily fit 1-2-3 and WordStar and dBase III
     into the AT with Topview,  but then they had about  12K  to  work
     with  total!  Even  with  the EMS (extended memory specification,
     that  allows  you  to  use  up  to   4   Megabytes   more)   from
     Lotus/Intel/Microsoft,  there's  still  not  a lot of room there.
     Yet another problem is that it's slow.  Even  mainframes  perform
     more slowly when they have more terminals on-line;  try loading 5
     programs into your micro and waiting for them!

         So that you IBM fans don't  criticize  me  for  not  speaking
     Fidonews                     Page 18                   9 Jun 1986


     about multitasking on other computers,  or the lack thereof, I'll
     tell you that no  other  computer  has  it.  Sure,  the  Mac  has
     Switcher,  and  the  ST series (520 and 1040) have the potential,
     and the Amiga has multitasking but no software to  show  for  it.
     Does  anyone  here  think  that  Apple  II+'s  are  going  to  be
     multitasking soon?  If you ask me,  the new 68000 machines  (ST's
     and Amigas) will have it much sooner than the others.

         If you ask me again,  though,  it may be a while until we get
     true multitasking onto any micro.


       Multicomputers

         I told you once before that I have four computers at home:  a
     DEC  VT180  (on  which  I'm writing this),  a Fountain XT (an IBM
     clone),  a Seicom II+ (an Apple clone),  and  an  Osborne  1.  It
     seems  as  though  I'm  going to need some format-changers pretty
     soon,  since I'm trying to do more and  more  work  on  different
     machines.  One of the biggest problems that I'm beginning to have
     is  with the modem on the DEC,  a Qubie.  Either a chip is loose,
     or its just not working too great,  or  the  Old  Westbury  phone
     lines  are  as bad for computers as they are for humans,  but the
     modem likes to drop carrier a lot.

         Anyway,  what  I  tried  to do a few weeks ago was transfer a
     file from the Fountain to the DEC.  After about an hour of trying
     different  methods,  I  finally  gave  up,  and  in  desperation,
     uploaded the file to my local Fido,  downloaded it onto the other
     machine,  and presto!  All done.  There's got to be a better way.
     Any ideas?


         Software support

         I  just  got off the phone with Borland International several
     hours ago, regarding upgrading my Turbo Pascal to the IBM version
     (with windowing, color graphics,  and the like).  I must say that
     they  are  very  easy  to  deal  with,  and responded quickly and
     courteously to my questions.  If only we had more companies  like
     them  in  the  world.  [Editor's note:  Yeah,  but don't look for
     reviews of their stuff here.  FidoNews doesn't qualify.]

         One thing that I thought was excellent  was  the  quality  of
     support.  It  wasn't an operator who told me that she didn't know
     the answer,  I  got  a  knowledgeable  person  who  could  answer
     everything that I needed.

         For  those of you who are considering doing what I did (trade
     up from CP/M to IBM),  I'll give you the  information  that  they
     gave  me,  so you won't have to call them.  Basically,  you get a
     certain amount of credit  toward  newer  or  different  versions.
     Version  3.0 gives you $39.95,  1.0 and 2.0 are $29.95.  You then
     apply that credit toward the purchase of  a  newer  or  different
     version,  send in a check with your original master diskette, and
     they'll send you back a diskette with the newer version on it.

         Even though the Borland license is much easier to  understand
     that those of most other companies,  I wasn't sure about if I was
     allowed to keep copies of my old version of Pascal.  If  you  are
     interested  in  knowing,  you  aren't  allowed  to  use  the  old
     diskette.  Actually,  it's  kind  of  easy  to  understand.   The
     license  only  applies  to  the  diskette  that  you have in your
     possession,  and as you send in your original  diskette  and  get
     back  a  new  one,  you only are allowed to use the new one.  Not
     that I had so many programs in CP/M that I wanted to keep,  but I
     wasn't sure if I could still use both of them.

         As  an  unsolicited  plug,  let me say that I advise each and
     every one of you to go out and buy Turbo Pascal within  the  next
     week.  Unless  you have some really weird machine,  they've got a
     version for you,  and unless you would rather program in  another
     language,  it's  the best purchase you'll ever make (I have never
     regretted switching to Pascal as my primary language).


         Hot News!  Hot News! (last-minute update)

         I just found out that Pitney-Bowes is working on a  facsimile
     machine  that will send and receive data using a modem!  Although
     it's still in the  design  stages,  and  won't  be  released  for
     another month or two,  this has the potential to change a lot.  I
     came up with the idea (is anyone from P-B listening?) to use  the
     new Fastlink 10,000+ bps modem,  which would enable Fax documents
     to be transmitted in less than 20 seconds  or  so!  Even  without
     the  Fastlink,  this is an incredible idea,  one which may change
     the face of faxes forever!  I'll keep you people posted with  the
     news as I find it out.


         Next time

         As I said last time,  I know that this is a short column, but
     until I get myself past all of these  different  deadlines  (next
     week  or  so),  and  then an election campaign for my youth group
     (which should be over by the time that you read this),  and  then
     maybe  even writing a few more programs,  they may stay that way.
     Depending on what I'm interested in  next  time,  I  may  discuss
     public-domain software,  the future of BBS', computer English, or
     any of a number of other things.  We'll  see.  Until  next  time,
     happy computing!!

                   MINDSET Conference using EchoMail


     I am looking for Fido's around  the  U.S.  that  are  willing  to
     participate in a conference for the MINDSET computer.  This would
     be  using  the EchoMail software and dedicating a message section
     to the conference.
