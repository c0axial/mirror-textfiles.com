     =================================================================


     According to FidoNet Policy, FidoNews is supposed to be part of the
     'glue' that holds us together as a Network.  It is also supposed to
     be 'made available' to all Nodes by their respective FidoNet
     Coordinators [ZC to RC to NC to Node].

     Back in the 'dim time', we used to DELIVER the weekly files to our
     Nodes if they were local calls and hold them if they were long
     distance calls.  In the dim time most Nodes were local to their NC
     and we didn't have these megaNets with many LD Nodes in their
     structure.  Even those, however, usually are broken down into Hubs
     that are local to NC and hubbed Nodes.

     So WHY isn't FidoNews being delivered to the local Nodes?  Every Node
     in FidoNet should be receiving this weekly update of life and doings
     in our Network.  It's tough to be the 'glue' if the cap never gets
     off of the bottle.

     I'm calling upon all FidoNet Coordinators to get FidoNews back into
     FULL FidoNet distribution to ALL Nodes.  FidoNews relies on the
     contributions from the Sysops of FidoNet.  We are unlikely to get such
     submissions if many Nodes either don't know about FidoNews [how did
     that happen?] or don't receive it every week from their Coordinator or
     Hub. It is the FidoNet Policy-dictated responsibility of EVERY FidoNet
     Coordinator to get the NODEDIFF and the FidoNews to the Nodes under
     their coordination.  You Coordinators volunteered for this job when
     you signed on so how about getting with it?

     If you Coordinators have any excuses for why FidoNews isn't getting
     out to your Nodes, please send it in to FidoNews as an .ART file for
     the next issue.  I'd be interested in the alibis. [grin]

     I'm also interested in how FidoNews gets outside of Zone 1.

     Thanks.
                       C.B.

       NOTE: Another reminder that FIDONEWS Echo is now on the Zone 1
             Backbone.  Areafix it from your local Echomail source and
             join us there for discussion and announcements as well as
             being able to send in articles for FidoNews via the Echo.

     Descent - A New Echo for those who are hopelessly addicted
     Moderated by Jim Sorofty 1:243/75

     We are attempting to have a new echo added to the backbone and your
     help is urgently needed. The Descent Players Echo (DESCENT) is a
     place to discuss all aspects of Descent I & Descent II. It is a
     place to meet players close to you and from around the world.

     All of the criteria for having this echo added to backbone
     distribution have been satisfied. Within the next three weeks the
     backbone coordinators will be voting on whether or not this echo
     area will be carried. Your help is needed to ensure that your
     Regional Echomail Coordinator knows that +you+ are interested in
     receiving this area. Please take a few moments to netmail your REC
     (with a copy to me at 1:243/75) informing them of your desire to
     carry the DESCENT echo and asking that they support its addition in
     the upcoming vote.

     I am confident that we have the support of REC12 and according to
     the guidelines, one more REC's vote (two would be nice) is needed
     to accomplish our goal. Please don't delay. If enough support for
     this echo is not received to list the echo this time around, the
     idea will be dropped.

     Thank you for your time, consideration and help. I hope to see you
     in the DESCENT Echo soon.

     Making Fidonet Perform
     Damian Walker, 2:2502/666

     It may appear to some people that Fidonet has an identity crisis.
     Many people regard Fidonet as a collection of BBS's.  Some people see
     Fidonet as a number of echoes.  Others insist that Fidonet has nothing
     to do with echoes or BBS's.  So what is Fidonet?
         In this article I will take a look at existing opinions about what
     Fidonet is, look at what it can really do, and muse upon where it
     might be going.

         Is Fidonet a collection of BBS's?  Some people seem to think so.
     There is certainly a strong connection between Fidonet and BBS's, if
     only because Fidonet actually did start out as a collection of linked
     BBS's.
         A printed magazine here in the UK has a limited coverage of
     Fidonet, and their early articles showed this link between Fidonet and
     BBS's quite plainly, with Fidonet and BBS's being regarded as one and
     the same thing.  They even used the nodelist as a basis for their BBS
     directory!
         The view of Fidonet as an association of BBS's seems to be found
     FIDONEWS 13-31               Page 3                   29 Jul 1996


     with people who run BBS's, and also people who have little to do with
     Fidonet or data communications at all.
         Is Fidonet all about echoes?  A lot of people think so.  When
     people are talking about Fidonet as a 'friendly' place, especially
     when comparing it with the Internet, it is more often than not a
     comparison between Usenet newsgroups and Fidonet echoes.
         It is true that the main concern of many sysops as Fidonet nodes
     is centred upon the availability of echomail.  Isn't that why most of
     them obtained their node number?  Whether it is a personal interest in
     reading echomail, or an indirect way of attracting users to a BBS,
     echomail seems to hold the central key.
         So why do people say that Fidonet has little to do with either?
     This seems a political or technical concern rather than a statement of
     the principal use or capability of Fidonet.  Fidonet is defined by the
     nodelist, nothing more.
         A node may exist which takes no echomail; perhaps they just wish
     to make some files available for request.  A node may definitely exist
     and function without a BBS-- my own system testifies to this.
     However, this minor digression masks the main purpose of this article,
     which is to take Fidonet as a whole rather than looking for exceptions
     to the norm.

         So, what can Fidonet do?  We've already seen two uses: Linking
     BBS's and providing echomail.  However, there are some other things
     which are currently going on, which are connected with neither: files
     and games, for instance.  Let's take a quick look at some of the
     capabilities of this network.
         BBS's are an obvious place to start, and need no explanation here.
     They provide an easy interface for beginners to many of the other
     things available in Fidonet.  Even long-standing comms enthusiasts
     find the BBS interface a comfortable way of accessing Fidonet.
         Echomail should need no introduction either.  Most networks and
     on-line services provide some form of conference mail, be it Fidonet,
     the Internet, Compuserve or some other proprietary bulletin board
     system.  Conference mail is the principal means of communicating with
     others in most networks, and in Fidonet it remains the most often used
     medium for advertising activities and services (such as BBS's, echoes
     and things non-comms related).
         Games are another popular use of Fidonet.  I'm not just thinking
     of door games here, most of which could be regarded as an integral
     part of a BBS.  There are, however, some games which offer inter-BBS
     connectivity between BBS's, and these are of more interest to us in
     our guise as Fidonet enthusiasts (rather than BBS sysops).
         Other games of interest are the PBM (play-by-mail) games which are
     played on the Internet, and to a lesser extent, on Fidonet.  Many
     games players will have heard of VGA Planets, specifically designed
     for PBM.  Stars! is another example of this type of game.
         Fidonet provides not only an excellent way of exchanging the game
     data for these games, but also (through echomail) a means of finding
     opponents. The same holds true of most games providing a play-by-mail
     option.  The only thing we are currently lacking is a game which
     supports Fidonet directly, although many utilities are available for
     one of the games already mentioned, to allow automatic interface with
     a BBS.
         Bulletins are something which are increasingly making use of
     Fidonet technology.  'Bulletins' is probably the least used section of
     FIDONEWS 13-31               Page 4                   29 Jul 1996


     most BBS's, and yet this is sometimes the most direct and appropriate
     way to offer information to users.  Bulletins are invaluable for
     specialist systems who could offer information on their chosen
     interest.
         As well as being an option or section on most BBS's, bulletins are
     now being increasingly offered across the network, via netmail.  Take
     a look at my article in last week's Fidonews for one example of this.
     This allows hobbyists to share information on a one-to-one basis with
     each other no matter which BBS they regularly call, wherever they live
     in the world.  Bulletins can also be distributed using regular file
     request availability (as with ARTSPEC).
         File echoes are a way of distributing files in Fidonet, and
     provide a facility much like the 'ftp' mirrors on the Internet,
     ensuring that the latest versions of files related to a certain
     subject or product are available at a number of sites.
         That sums up all the broad categories of use in Fidonet which I
     can think of at the time of writing (if I've left anything out, be
     sure to write to FidoNews and tell us about it!)

         But what of the future?  With the shrinking of the nodelist, the
     future is something which we need to look at with more cognitive
     effort than before.  We really need to think of something if our part
     of the data communications hobby isn't to be taken from us by the
     increasing popularity of other communications systems.  The reasons
     why people are leaving Fidonet is beyond the scope of this article,
     but further development of various aspects of the network can help to
     keep it alive, and perhaps to even grow once again, if chosen
     carefully.
         BBS's are Fidonet's first contact with most people.  With their
     simple software and hardware requirements, and often an easy-to-use
     menu interface, they are already an ideal way to introduce new users
     to the wonders of Fidonet.
         How can they be improved?  Aesthetics is one way people have tried
     to improve BBS usage.  Some people take advantage of increasing
     communications speeds by making their ANSI menus pretty with colour
     and animation.  Others take advantage of the increasing use of GUI's
     to provide a graphical interface, sometimes using HTML in the
     interests of standardisation.  Some might say that this is just
     pandering to those who need pretty colours to keep their attention.
     But perhaps this forms the majority of new users, who are not easily
     attracted by technical details and a 'quaint' hobbyist atmosphere.
     Who knows?  Improving the visual effect of our interface is certainly
     one way to go.
         General ease of use is another step towards improving BBS's.  Some
     people have suggested a way of standardising the BBS interface,
     although few if any BBS's have followed these concepts through (if you
     know of an instance where standardisation across BBS's has worked, it
     may make an interesting article for FidoNews, hint hint).  Although it
     has been said that this approach will lose the individuality of BBS's,
     standardisation of keypresses along with individuality of screen
     design might provide a suitable compromise.
         Next we move on to echomail.  How can this be improved?  Although
     many people see echomail's friendliness as an advantage in its own
     right, there have still been many suggestions for improvement (as an
     aside, I wonder how many people promoting Fidonet's friendliness read
     sysop echoes).
     FIDONEWS 13-31               Page 5                   29 Jul 1996


         Some people would like to see the universal acceptance of high
     ASCII.  This is a controversial point, as although this would allow
     accented characters and pretty 'graphical' signatures, there are a
     number of disadvantages.  Even leaving the point that some machines
     cannot cope reliably with 8-bit ASCII characters, there is not yet a
     network-wide standard for these characters, meaning users of different
     platforms still see different characters.  Possible future
     developments in this direction are many and varied, and too numerous
     to go into detail about here.
         Moderation is definitely an advantage to build on.  Views on
     methods of appointing conference moderators, and actually performing
     moderation duties, vary considerably, and so it would be nice to see
     coherent approaches and methods of moderation which would satisfy the
     reason of having moderators (to keep echoes on topic and legal) whilst
     keeping the disadvantages (of despotic moderators from hell) to a
     minimum.  Perhaps technical improvements giving moderators and
     echomail co-ordinators more control over echomail and echolists is
     something which could be considered.
         Areas of Fidonet other than BBS's and echomail, which are already
     fairly well developed, provide the most scope for improvement.
         Games form a large part of BBS and Fidonet use, probably taking
     third place to files and echomail.  There are a great many 'door'
     games for BBS's available, which although less visually attractive
     than stand-alone games, offer a level of interaction between players
     which is difficult to surpass-- especially given the hardware platform
     requirements of such games.
         Many door games could be much improved if a link to other BBS's
     was added; some door games already work this way.  Thus, if a BBS only
     has a handful of players interested in a game, these players could
     join with those on another BBS to give a much more exciting
     competition.  Games which already work in this way have a large number
     of enthusiastic players who already possess the hardware to play Doom,
     Quake and other visually exciting games-- thus is their appeal.
         There are many other games which are played using Fidonet
     technology which are not door games, as has been mentioned.  Few of
     these interface directly to Fidonet, so their use and sysop appeal
     could be much more widespread if interfaces to standard netmail (for
     file attach of their game files) were developed.  Interfacing with
     Fidonet netmail is no great task for a competent programmer-- if I
     managed it then anybody can!
         Something I would personally like to see in Fidonet is the
     existence of games in the traditional PBM style.  Such games usually
     communicate from host to players in straight text; the traditional PBM
     game is played on paper, with orders sent to the host via snailmail,
     typed into the automated host, and results are printed on paper.  The
     electronic equivalent uses email for the purpose, with players sending
     their orders to the host using text-adventure style commands.
         I have not seen any games of this type available in Fidonet, which
     is a pity.  They are very popular on the Internet, and some games have
     attracted so much interest that there are waiting lists for
     prospective players! A major hurdle to the production of this type of
     game is the size of routed netmail (the Galaxy PBM generates upto 40k
     per message). However, the use of direct (crash or hold) netmail for
     larger messages would help in this respect, as would drastic economies
     in the size of the game's output.  The C source code for some Internet
     PBM games are available; if anyone is interested in obtaining them for
     FIDONEWS 13-31               Page 6                   29 Jul 1996


     porting to Fidonet then let me know via netmail.
         Bulletins are another area in Fidonet which leaves a great deal of
     room for improvement.  Being the developer of a document server
     myself, I am loathe to suggest too many ideas on the technical side
     lest someone asks me to put my money where my mouth is, so to speak.
         However, using existing technology there is much that could be
     done to improve the use and availability of bulletins on a
     network-wide basis.  The advertising of bulletins in echomail is one
     way to alert people to information available, although this begs the
     question, why not just post the bulletin into the echo.  Where a
     bulletin is too large or too regularly updated for a regular echo
     posting, however, this approach is quite acceptable-- providing you
     advertise in a suitable echo!  Advertising a bulletin in FidoNews
     could be a good idea too (see my article in FidoNews 1330).  Time will
     tell whether this way actually works.
         Another route to the increased promotion and use of bulletins is
     co-operation between the bulletins' authors (remember, they don't all
     have to be sysops).  For instance if two BBS's in different parts of a
     country, or the world, have the same speciality, the bulletin of one
     system could refer users to the other, and vice versa.  As such
     documents become more widespread it may be a good idea to make sure
     you refer to at least one other document of interest in each of your
     own documents; if this becomes more widespread then in turn you will
     find other people's documents referring to your own.

         It is a popular opinion that some sort of improvement is necessary
     to guarantee the survival of Fidonet, and thus the survival of
     free-of-charge communications on a world-wide scale.  I hope that this
     article has provided food for thought, especially to those of you who,
     before now, regarded Fidonet as merely a collection of BBS's or a
     method of transferring conference mail.  Because the basic Fidonet
     standard concerns itself only with the nodelist, and the transfer of
     netmail and of any type of file, it is clear that Fidonet can be much,
     much more.

     10 cents a Dance
     by Michele Stewart, 1:369/21

     Okay, okay... so this article is not really about dancing. But it is
     about some of the best echos in Fidonet. <grin> I moderate three
     really exciting echos I'd like to tell you about. Let me start with
     the first, and one of the oldest. Started in 1989, this echo is for
     the computer nerd in all of us...

     PC_ADDICT Echo
     --------------

                 GEEK ALERT!   GEEK ALERT!  GEEK ALERT!

     If you are on your computer for more than 4 hours a day, outside of
     your work hours, then you've got a minor problem and probable PC
     FIDONEWS 13-31               Page 7                   29 Jul 1996


     Addiction. But if you think your computer is your best friend, you've
     got a serious problem and probable Geek infestation!

     To get rid of those cumbersome, tiresome, boring, repetetive, anal
     retentive geeks, you need to write intelligent, thought provoking,
     humorous messages to other PC Addicts.

     Remember:

     Your computer is NOT your best friend. She only provides you the
     means to making alot of them.

     Your computer is NOT better than a date. She only provides you with
     the means for actually meeting someone strange enough to want to go
     out with you.

     Your computer is NOT your whole life. She only provides you with the
     means to expand your interests and share your hopes, dreams, likes and
     dislikes with real people.

     Now, get rid of those annoying, pesky geeks and come join us in
     lively discussion, fun banter and social intercoursing (no that's not
     a dirty word) in the PC-ADDICT echo! The only place where you can
     complain about your addiction and perpetuate it at the same time!

     Okay, now on to the next echo which is another of my favorites...

                             -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
     BBSCON Echo
     -----------

     If you're attending, thinking of attending or just interested in any
     BBS Convention or trade show, then there's a backbone echo you can
     join to find or share the latest info. It's a place for keeping each
     other informed of who's going where, what's going on, where to write
     for more info, who's joining in a convoy, who's flying, etc., ad
     nauseum.

     With the demise of Cyber.Xpo.96 and the change in focus of One BBSCon
     to One ISPCon, many of us dialup BBS system operators are feeling left
     out of the loop with no where to go. Small Regional conventions and
     gatherings, as well as other trade shows are still being discussed
     though.

     Information about the conventions, hotels, day trips, BOF get
     togethers, special events and everything else can be posted here.
     We're not worried about redundant postings either so you are
     encouraged to share something that you might have read elsewhere.

     Discussion of all BBS related conventions, whether professional or
     FIDONEWS 13-31               Page 8                   29 Jul 1996


     amateur, is welcome in the echo. If you are planning a mini-con for
     your area, you're welcome to discuss it here.

     If interested please consider linking up and sharing this echo with
     your users as well as fellow sysops.

     And lastly, a new echo, still awaiting backbone status but of
     importance to all of us as sysops and people concerned with making the
     online experience even better!

                             -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

     AOP Echo
     --------

     The Association of Online Professionals is YOUR Association and now
     they've got an echo.

     The conference is dedicated to issues that affect the management and
     maintenance of online services.  Hosted by members of the Association
     of Online Professionals, it will present information and discussion
     about legislation and regulation; marketing of BBSs and other online
     services; customer service; system design and development; and news
     and information about the AOP and benefits of membership.

     Link to the AOP echo today for up-to-date information concerning your
     hobby, avocation, vocation and/or chosen profession.

     A Call For Programmers Of A New Common BBS Interface
     by David Rye, 1:3649/10

     Despite seeing all the ads listing Web pages for various companies,
     despite being told that the internet is going to make all our lives
     perfect, despite seeing how the days of the BBS are numbered... do all
     of you really believe this?

     I often wonder how thrilled with the new technology people will be
     FIDONEWS 13-31               Page 9                   29 Jul 1996


     when they receive their first bill from a service provider; that is,
     after Junior has discovered some Butt Bunnies From Beverly Hills web
     page, and then used Dad's 14,400 baud to view all six-hundred photos
     they have digitized on-line.

     Back in the prehistoric times when I programmed for recreation, I
     spent quite a bit of time writing tools for my BBS.  Things to make
     life easier for myself, or my users.  Half of the time I would end up
     writing something because I couldn't afford someone's $79 fee for
     registering a program that sorted the file listings, or that allowed
     the user to download a catalog of the echoes my BBS offered.  Looking
     back on the many things that I spent writing, I could have converted
     that into something a little more useful had I just possessed an easy
     means of writing something that would work with other systems.  The
     multiple formats for everything from file listings to message bases
     prevented me from doing that without going to extraordinary means.

     If the backyard BBS is really to provide something that will attract
     the more novice users who expect to be able to do anything one hour
     after setting the system up, then they must unite to provide a common,
     easy, standardized format for the transmission of information.  This
     all sounds familiar, right?  Well, instead of just sighing and shaking
     our heads over each user that will never have the fun of signing onto
     a local BBS, why can't some of us get together and start working on
     some practical code that will allow a user to log onto a graphics
     oriented system, even if said user couldn't find their mouse with two
     hands and a flashlight?

     With some of the more common tools available today, it shouldn't be so
     hard to get something up and running; both in terms of a BBS, and a
     user interface that could be given away to anyone that was willing to
     take a disk.  The use of something along the lines of Borland's Delphi
     would allow much faster, much neater, and much more standardized code
     amongst a group of persons interested in doing the aforementioned
     task.

     Why sit on our thumbs and bemoan the loss of users when one possible
     solution is within our grasp if we are willing to put forth the
     effort?  Surely some of you remember the task of putting together a
     BBS, trying to get compatible software to help you run it, and so
     forth?  If this process could be made invisible to the end user it
     would make it much easier to go through those struggles again as a
     whole new line of programs was started.

     Instead of giving up, why not give it a try?  We all did it before if
     I remember correctly.  Anyone that has an interest in trying to
     develop new software with a published data format that will allow the
     point and click, graphic based BBS is more than welcome to contact me
     at my FidoNet address of 1:3649/10.

     The Skeptic Tank
     FIDONEWS 13-31               Page 10                  29 Jul 1996


     (818) 335-9601

     Clocking in on the "Just-when-you-thought-they-couldn't-
     get-any-lower" port:

     As most members of FidoNet and Internet know, the "church" of
     Scientology has been engaged in a war against Internet and BBS
     SysOps around the world in an attempt to silence both their
     critics as well as those (usually ex-Scientologists) who
     continually expose both the contents of and criminal activities
     of the "church."  The focus of their war against the networks
     has always been alt.religion.scientology and, to a far smaller
     extent, a few FidoNet forums, yet they have also tried to silence
     critics out in the real world.

     Time Magazine, the Washington Post, television news, and even
     makers of Public Broadcasting documentaries which have exposed
     the activities of the cult have been attacked, both in the
     courts as well as physically in person. (Members of the cult
     even vandalized the automobiles of PBS employees in an attempt
     to silence them.)

     In the past (as reported by newspapers and magazines around the
     world) the cult has repeatedly tried to illegally remove the
     alt.religion.scientology forum from Internet, forging messages
     to do so.  Additionally, unknown members of the cult have been
     assigned ("Hatted" in the jargon of the cult) to systematically
     forge cancellation messages of other participants' messages.

     The latest low to which the cult had stooped to has been to try
     to spam the forum with _thousands_ of pointless, meandering,
     we've-seen-it-all-before propaganda messages daily.

     Those who may be new to FidoNet or Internet might not know how
     the two technologies are different.  In FidoNet messages are
     created on thousands of systems, collected and grouped by echo
     tag, and sent to a series of centralized locations and messages
     which are dropped into the datastream are not recallable by
     the author.

     On Internet, however, an individual may cancel a posting at a
     later date which has the effect of requesting that all systems
     which have the designated message identification number be
     deleted.  A system then has the option of removing the canceled
     message or not.

     Additionally, in FidoNet we employ AreaFix to turn on or turn
     off subscribed echo forums whereas in Internet, a rmgroup is
     sent to a centralized location to have the entire group removed
     from all the mail servers which honor the rmgroup.

     The last way in which the two are different is the control of
     message spamming.  In FidoNet a disruptive influence is quite
     easily removed simply by asking the SysOp or the SysOp's
     network coordinator to remove someone.  (Unless said someone is
     Steve Winter.  <wink> <wink> )
     FIDONEWS 13-31               Page 11                  29 Jul 1996


     Internet doesn't have that ability.  Internet Service Providers
     must be asked to remove a disruptive individual from a newsgroup
     yet, if it's a commercial account, most ISP's don't _like_
     removing someone from having access to newsgroups based simply
     upon a rash of complaints filed against them.  The primary
     reason for not wishing to remove disruptive individuals seems
     to be the cries of censorship which plagues ISPs these days.
     (While America Online has no ethical or moral qualms against
     imposing censorship, nearly every other ISP does to different
     degrees.)

     FidoNet and Internet do share a common problem with removing a
     disruptive individual, however, and members of the Scientology
     cult have been putting this failing into good use:  Someone who
     is ejected from a FidoNet newsgroup may simply locate another
     system which carries the echo and thus continue to post until he
     is once again ejected from that system.  It then becomes an easy
     exercise to go through a list of systems known to carry the
     echo and an individual can live a long, long time -- provided
     they are willing to expend the time, money, and effort.

     The Scientology cult has been picking up free hours from a broad
     spectrum of Internet Service Providers and posting thousands
     upon thousands of messages -- until the ISP puts a stop to it
     at which point another account is used on the same ISP for the
     same network abuse or another ISP is used altogether.

     The Scientology cult has drawn attention to itself around the
     world, even prompting a report from Taz.  Cornelius Krasel, U
     Wuerzburg, (Dept. of Pharmacology, Versbacher Str. 9 D-97078
     Wuerzburg, Germany, email:
     <a href="mailto:phak004@rzbox.uni-wuerzburg.de">

         [the office]
         Robots suffocate the discussion

         Since several weeks, the usenet newsgroup
         "alt.religion.scientology" is being flooded by anonymous
         nonsense contributions.

         Shouting down used to be not quite so easy: one needed a
         majority on their side. It has become more convenient in
         the Internet. The automatical electronic down-shouter
         squashes any discussion - without any majority.

         In the usenet group alt.religion.scientology followers and
         adversaries of the science-fiction author, L. Ron Hubbard,
         discuss enthusiastically about his odd teachings. Recently,
         somebody has been trying to squash this discussion. His
         method, "vertical spamming", is easy: in a short period of
         time, a huge amount (in this case almost 10.000) of
         meaningless, computer-generated messages are posted in the
         group.

     FIDONEWS 13-31               Page 12                  29 Jul 1996


         This is supposed to overload the computers, but especially
         the participants of the discussion which have to work
         themselves first through hundreds of robot-letters before
         being able to read a sensible contribution. Unnerved, many
         finish the discussion.

         It is almost impossible for the net community to defend
         itself against this kind of attack. The nonsense would have
         to be sorted out by hand, short-lived throw-away accounts
         hide the true originator. Nevertheless, the American Jon
         Noring (noring@netcom.com) believes to have found the true
         cause: the Church of Scientology itself. He has placed a
         petition in the internet which is supposed to lead
         Scientology to cease the spamming (to sign the petition,
         send an empty email to petition-1@netcom.com until June
         30th). Noring's clues for the sect's authorship: all the
         jamming contributions are pro-scientology, nothing but short
         excerpts from a Scientology publication, and all start with
         the same introductory sentence which states that "a lot of
         wrong information about Scientology is being distributed
         in alt.religion.scientology".

         When, some time ago, "secret" teaching documents of the sect
         had been published on the net, Scientology had used similar
         "throw-away-accounts" and normed texts to take the
         publications back - why, Noring asks, remains the sect
         silent this time, although large parts of the injected
         postings contain a copyright mark? The silent approval would
         speak for a participation of the money-greedy organization.
         In addition, Noring thinks that Scientologists planned such
         spamming for a long time - the secret plan can be found
         in his directory at

     It's important, I feel, to get a broad-spectrum exposure of what
     is being done to Internet out into both FidoNet and the real
     world as I can expect the success or failure of the attacks to
     be an object lesson for others who might feel the need to
     emulate the Scientology cult's activities.  In FidoNet we have
     yet to experience this level of attack -- we have safeguards.

     Knowing what type of activities "hatted" members of the cult
     are expected to engage in before hand will doubtless keep most
     people from joining the cult.  Knowing that technological fixes
     for such abuse exists and that spamming to silence critics is
     a futile and embarrassing prospect should also help to keep
     this type of abuse down.

     Spread the word.

     ECROC:  Good, Bad, or Ugly
     By Troy H. Cheek, 1:362/708.4

     "The real world is what I see.  The real world is what you see.
     Strangely, they are never the same real worlds." -JMS of B5

     Our good friend Bob Moravsik of 2606/583, in the guise of injecting
     some reality into the ECROC discussion, basically tells us that
     anybody who doesn't think ECROC is a good idea is some kind of
     "immature" "control freak."  As someome who thinks ECROC is a good
     idea with a bad implementation, I guess that makes me a *mature*
     control freak.  :-)

     Bob also tells us that moderators exist only to serve the posters.
     This is certainly true, from a certain point of view.  Civil servants
     such as the police exist only to serve the populace.  However, this
     doesn't mean that if you don't like a particular law and want it
     changed, you can ignore the police in the meantime.

     Bob says that ECROC "doesn't put a router in the position of judging."
     Sorry, but that's _exactly_ what it does.  'Here, Mr. Router, take
     these rules and these messages from an echo you probably have no
     experience with and tell me this person doesn't deserve to have his
     access cut.'  That isn't judging?

     Bob says that ECROC "stops the Robbins/Winter/Johnstone/Milner/Degan
     mentaility of making up rules as you go and enforcing them unequally.
     He left out Gerber/Benge/Frezberg.  And me, I guess, since I've been
     compared to some of these for engaging in such sandbox antics like
     reminding users that profanity is not allowed, such marble-grabbing
     tactics as asking that off-topic conversations be moved to other
     echoes, or the big-frog-in-a-small-pond horror of disallowing personal
     FIDONEWS 13-31               Page 14                  29 Jul 1996


     attacks.  I'm also supposedly on the receiving end of a civil rights
     suit for interfering with a poster's right to Free Speech, and there's
     reportedly a 20-sysop team in Canada working furiously to get my right
     to be a moderator revoked.

     "All" ECROC requires, Bob says is that the moderator produce:

          1. The text of the rule that was broken

     if your echo even has written rules, or rules more specific than "play
     nice and stay on topic."  A crooked moderator could easily write a
     rule later and claim it was in effect when a certain message was
     posted.  A crooked poster could claim the moderator did just that.  A
     moderator could still selectively enforce rules by only attempting to
     cut feeds to certain posters, or even writing rules that only affect
     certain posters.

          2. The message(s) that broke the rules

     if you keep copies of every message posted in the echo, never have a
     floppy eaten, and never have a hard drive crash.  A crooked moderator
     could fake messages.  A crooked poster could claim the messages were
     faked by the moderator or someone else.

          3. Two netmail warnings

     that you can't prove the poster ever received.  A crooked moderator
     could write warnings after the fact, or write them and never send
     them.  A crooked poster could claim he never received them.  With
     routed netmail being as unreliable as it is and some systems not
     accepting "crashed" messages, who's to say?

          4. The text of messages that show that a person has ignored the
             warnings

     that he claims he never received or were even sent.  See above.

     I don't know where Bob got statistics that say that "[q]uite often a
     request to cut a link is done in the heat of a strong debate."  Do
     you?

     I won't argue that ECROC wouldn't at least slow down most of the
     excessive moderators, possibly stopping many.  I will argue, however,
     that it will hamstring the efforts of many honest moderators who want
     nothing more than to keep things running reasonably smoothly.

     I mean, take the not unreasonable hypothetical situation of a sysop
     connecting to an echo and immediately begin uplinking a dozen
     objectionable messages a day.  Maybe it's commercial advertisements,
     totally off-topic rants, personal attacks, or accounts of sexual
     escapades so raunchy that even your oversexed brother is blushing.

     What then?  If I'm reading ECROC right, and I invite anyone to point
     out where I might be getting it wrong, I'd first have to make sure the
     rules of the echo didn't allow these posts.  Then I'd have to netmail
     a warning.  After a suitable amount of time to see if the warning was
     FIDONEWS 13-31               Page 15                  29 Jul 1996


     heeded, I'd have to send a second.  Again after waiting a suitable
     amount of time, I'd netmail his router with a link cut request, a copy
     of the rules, and a sample of the offending material.  Then I have to
     wait a few days while the router judges the validity of my request.
     If he rules against me, I have to start the same process all over
     again with him...

     We're talking a *minimum* here of a couple of weeks, and possibly a
     couple of months, of the echo being disrupted.  Without ECROC, it's a
     matter of a few days.

     But enough of that.  As I said above, I think ECROC is a good idea,
     but don't care for the current proposed implementation.  In order that
     ECROC properly serve all the affected parties, I'd like to suggest the
     following changes:

     1)  Until ECROC is approved and becomes mandatory, consider it null
         and void.  Some systems living by ECROC while others ignore it
         will only add to the confusion.

     2)  ECROC must recognize that the job of moderating an echo falls on
         the moderator, and not on routers or sysops or end users.

     3)  Initial link cut requests, once confirmed as genuine, must be
         honored immediately.

     4)  Cut links will have, say, two weeks to appeal the link cut order
         to the router, who will of course contact the moderator.  *Then*
         they can debate rules and violations and warnings.  Within a
         reasonable amount of time (say, a month or so) the links will be
         restored, or not, as the case may be.

     The upshot of my suggestions is that, unlike the current proposed
     ECROC, disruptive posters don't get to continue posting disruptive
     messages while the moderator tries to prove that they are indeed being
     disruptive.  However, those who were cut unfairly still get a chance
     to tell their side and get reinstated.

     Finally, Bob quotes that "You are well within your right to refuse to
     cut a link..."  Again, only if the router is asked to serve as the
     judge of the rightness of the moderator's request is this true.

     Later,
     Troy

     Zone 7 Flame will get international?

     When I got my first Fidonet Point Address back in Fall '93, the
     sysop echos were full of flame about Zone 7. It ended quietly
     when the Moderators became tired of the wars and declared them off

     topic.

     I was a newbie then. And it was much of a surprise to me when I saw
     the leaders of the factions peacefully drinking beer together...

     Now the flame is gone, and the Zone 7 proponents have established an
     othernet which they believe to be the start of a new zone. The
     opponents just don't take it seriously. The matter is gone. Or WAS -
     until the #29 of Fidonews, which proposed Zone 7 over again!

     Will the flame come back in the snoozie? We shall see... I'm only a
     Point anyway, and I can probably get an FTPoint even in z1 if really
     needed (perhaps I'll try it in the fall). I can just stay away and
     not care. Let the big guys fight. Just you wait until they return
     from vacations...

     =================================================================


     FidoNet History  20 Aug 85
     by Tom Jennings and others

             This is Part Two in the history of FidoNet. It turned out that
     the original FIDOHIST.DOC (now called FIDOHIST.DC1, or just "Part
     One") was useful, and many people read it. Unfortunately, by the time
     everyone read it, it became totally obsolete. Oh well. Here is Part
     Two.

             FIDOHIST.DOC covered the early history of FidoNet, why it was
     done, how it was done, and the reasons for the organization and
     obscure rituals surrounding node numbers.  If you haven't read it yet,
     I suggest you do now, because I'll probably refer to things that won't
     make any sense otherwise.

             The original FidoNet was organized very simply; each FidoNet
     system (each node) had a number that served like a phone number,
     uniquely identifying it. The NODELIST, generated by the folks in St.
     Louis that had all FidoNet nodes in it, contains information on all
     known FidoNet systems. Every system in FidoNet had a current copy of
     the NODELIST, which served as the directory of systems.

             (In the interests of brevity I'm leaving out huge amounts of
     information; I hope you have read FIODHIST.DOC by now ...)

             FidoNet has been growing steadily since it started by accident
     in May 84 or so. The node list continued to get out of hand; the
     original FIDOHIST.DOC was written to try and help smooth things out.
     It is impossible to overemphasize the amount of work involved in
     keeping the node list accurate. Basically, the guys in St. Louis were
     keeping track of hundreds of FidoNet systems in Boston, Los Angeles,
     London, Stockholm and Sweden, and publishing the results weekly. There
     has never been such a comprehensive and accurate list of bulletin
     board systems generated.


             We talked for many months as to how we could possibly find a
     solution to the many problems; it was at the point where if a solution
     was not found in a few months (by Aug. 85 or so) that FidoNet would
     collapse due to the sheer weight of it's node list.

             The newsletter, FidoNews, was, and still is, an integral part
     of the process of FidoNet. FidoNews is the only thing that unites all
     FidoNet sysops consistently; please keep up to date on it, and stock
     it for your users if you have the disk space. And contribute if you
     can!

             There were many constraints on the kind of things we could do;
     we had no money, so it had to be done for zero cost.  Centralization
     was out, so obviously localization was in; just how to do it was a
     total unknown. We thought of going back to having people in different
     FIDONEWS 13-31               Page 18                  29 Jul 1996


     areas handle new node requests in their area, but that always
     generated confusion as to who a person should go to, how to avoided
     having someone requesting a node number from different people
     simultaneously, etc., etc.

             The old method of routing was very different than the current
     method, and much more complex; instead of Fido automatically routing
     to hosts, each sysop had to specify (via the ROUTE.BBS file) how all
     routing was done in the system. The was done originally by hand, later
     by John Warren's (102/31) NODELIST program.

             Then of course there was the problem that no matter what we
     did, it would not be done overnight. (ha ha.) It would take many weeks
     at the least, possibly months, so that whatever we did had to be
     compatible with the old method as well.

             We went through probably hundreds of ideas in the next few
     months, some possibly useful, some insane. Eventually the insanity
     boiled down to a pretty workable system. We chatted by FidoNet and by
     voice telephone. Eventually, we settled on the two part number scheme,
     like the phone company does with area codes and exchanges.  It
     accommodated backwards compatibility (you can keep your present node
     number) and the new "area code" (net number) could be added into an
     existing field that had been set to zero. (This is why everyone was
     originally part of net #1).


             When a fortunate set of circumstances was to bring Ezra
     Shapiro and me to St. Louis to speak to the McDonnell Douglas
     Recreational Computer Club on XXXX 11th, we planned ahead for a
     national FidoNet sysops meeting that weekend. Ken and Sally Kaplan
     were kind enough to tolerate having all of us in their living room.

             The people who showed up were (need that list) The meeting
     lasted ten continuous hours; it was the most productive meeting I (and
     most others) had attended. When we were done, we had basically the
     whole thing laid out in every detail.

             We stuck with the area code business (now known as net and
     region numbers) and worked out how to break things up into regions and
     nets. It was just one of those rare but fortunate events; during the
     morning things went "normally", but in the afternoon solutions fell
     into place one by one, so that by late afternoon we had the entire
     picture laid out in black and white. Two or three months of
     brainstorming just flowed smoothly into place in one afternoon ...

             What we had done was exactly what we have now, though we
     changed the name of "Admin" to "Region", and added the "alternate"
     node and net numbers. (We still seem to be stuck with that terrible
     and inaccurate word, "manager". Any ideas?) I previously had a buggy
     test hack running using area codes, and the week after the meeting it
     was made to conform to what we had talked about that Saturday.

             When version 10C was done, it accomplished more or less
     everything we wanted, but it sure did take a long time. 10C was
     probably the single largest change ever made to Fido/FidoNet, and the
     FIDONEWS 13-31               Page 19                  29 Jul 1996


     most thoroughly tested version. At 10M, there are STILL bugs left from
     that early version, in spite of the testing.

             Once the testing got serious, and it looked like we had a
     shippable version, St. Louis froze the node list, and started slicing
     it into pieces, to give to the soon-to-be net and region managers.
     (That word again.) This caused a tremendous amount of trouble for
     would-be sysops; not only was it difficult enough to figure out how on
     earth to get a node number, once they did they were told node numbers
     weren't being given out just yet. Explaining why was even harder,
     since FIDOHIST.DC2 (ahem) wasn't written yet. (I have to agree, this
     thing is a little bit late) It was a typical case of those who already
     knew were informed constantly of updates, but those in the dark had a
     hard time. Things were published fairly regularly (am I remembering
     "conveniently" or "accurately" on this part?)

             Eventually, 10C was released, and seemed to work fairly well,
     ignoring all the small scale disasters due to bugs, etc. We couldn't
     just swap over to the new area code business until very close to 100%
     of all Fidos were using the new version. This was (for me) an
     excruciating period, basically a "hurry up and wait" situation. There
     had not been a node list release for a month or two, and for all
     practical purposes it looked like FidoNet had halted ...

             Finally, on June 12th, we all swapped over to the new system;
     that afternoon, sysops were to set their net number (it had been "1"
     for backwards compatibility), copy in the new node list issued just
     for this occasion, and go. I assumed the result was going to be
     perpetual chaos, bringing about the collapse of FidoNet. Almost the
     exact opposite was true; things went very smoothly (yes, there were
     problems, but when you consider that FidoNet consists of
     microcomputers owned by almost 300 people who had never even talked to
     each other ...)

             Within a month or so, just about every Fido had swapped over
     to the area code, or net/node architecture. With a few exceptions,
     things went very smoothly. No one was more surprised than pessimistic
     I. At this time, August, I don't think there is a single system still
     using the old node number method.

             This is all well and fine as far as the software goes, but it
     made a mess for new sysops. For us sysops who have been around for a
     while, there was no great problem, as we saw the changes happen one by
     one. However, new sysops frequently came out of the blue; armed with a
     diskette full of code, they attempted to set up a FidoNet node.

             Actually, I don't understand how anyone does it. The
     information needed is not recorded in any place that a non sysop could
     find. On top of that, most of it is now totally wrong! If you follow
     the original instructions, it said "call Fido #1 ..." if you found a
     real antique, or "call Fido #51 ..." if it is more current.  Of course
     now it tells you to find your region manager. "Region manager???"
     Well, a list of region managers was published in FidoNews, but unless
     you read FidoNews, how does anyone ever find out? I'll probably never
     know.

     FIDONEWS 13-31               Page 20                  29 Jul 1996


             ANYWAYS ... the original reason for all the changes was to
     DECENTRALIZE FidoNet. It just wasn't possible for Ken Kaplan to keep
     accurate, up to date information on every Fido in the US and Europe.
     The decentralization has been more or less a total success. The number
     of problems introduced were negligible compared to the problems
     solved, and even most new problems are by this time solved.

             It is interesting to note that with the hundreds of systems
     there are today, the national FidoNet hour is less crowded than it was
     when there were only 50 nodes.

             Please, keep in mind that no one has done anything like this
     before, we are all winging it, and learning (hopefully) as we go.
     Please be patient with problems, none of us is paid to do this, and it
     is more and more work as time goes on. Somehow it seems to all get
     done ...

             HOW TO GET A NODE NUMBER AND ALL THAT

             This is by necessity a very general idea of how it's done, and
     you were warned earlier that this may be obsolete this very minute;
     with that, here's the "current" process for starting up a new FidoNet
     node.

             You can of course skip all or part of this if you've done this
     before; if you haven't, well, be prepared for a lot of searching and
     asking questions.

             Of course, you need to have your Fido BBS system running
     first. It's probably best that you play with it for a while, and get
     some experience with how it all works, and whether you have the
     patience to run a BBS. It can get exasperating, and you will never
     find time to use the computer ever again.

             Obtain the most recent copy of the nodelist possible; this may
     take some searching. If you get totally lost, you can always contact
     Fido 125/1 or Fido 100/51; though these are very busy systems, they
     both usually have the very latest of anything, and can direct you to
     the right place.

             The big problem here is to find out if you are in a net or
     not, and if not, then who your region manager is. If you are in a
     large city (Los Angeles, Cincinnati, etc) then there is probably a net
     in your area. Look through the node list (use the N)odebook command in
     Fido, or a text editor) for the right area code or city.

             If there is no net in your area, then you are part of a
     region. This is a little harder, because regions are large, and
     sometimes cover many states. Look at all the regions in the node list,
     you should find a region that fits you.

             Once you find this, you have to contact the net or region
     manager to get your node number. Exactly how this is done depends on
     who the manager is, and how sticky they are for details. A near
     universal requirement is that you send your request via FidoNet, not
     by manually; this isn't done to make your life difficult, but to
     FIDONEWS 13-31               Page 21                  29 Jul 1996


     ensure that your system is really working right. IF you manage to get
     a FidoNet message to the manager, its usually safe to assume that
     you're system is working OK. If you get a reply in return, then you
     know both directions work.

             It is usually each sysops' responsibility to go get the latest
     nodelist and newsletters; they are not distributed to all systems
     because of the expense. (Though, I'm trying to get them distributed to
     more places than they are now, it's sometimes very difficult to get a
     copy of the nodelist!)

             Again, read the FidoNews newsletter regularly; it is about the
     only way to stay in contact with the rest of the net. Programs,
     problems, services, bugs and interesting announcements can always be
     found there. FidoNews articles don't come out of thin air; send in
     anything you think might be of interest. They don't have to be
     lifetime masterpieces, or even well written.

             Please remember the entire network is made of the sysops;
     there is no central location from which good things come, the net
     consists entirely of the sysops and their contributions. If you don't
     do it, chances are no one else will!

        The echoes are kind of quiet these days.  Maybe everyone is glued

     our own Olympics on FidoNet?  Here is a summary of suggested events:

     The gold medal goes to the user who completes the "simple"
     registration procedure in the shortest time.  Contestants are advised

     draconian local sysop rules in a single logon session.

     The winner is the user who can find the echo he is looking for in the
     fewest BBS accesses.


     }} Echomail Events {{

     >> Verbal Gymnastics <<
     You won't believe how these competitors can twist and turn the English
     language into almost unrecognizable shapes.

     >> Greco-Roman Thread Wrestling <<
     Wrestling for control over the direction an echo conference thread
     will take.  Moderators are ineligible for this event.

     >> Marathon Messaging <<
     Contestants enter 75 messages in a single echo in one session.  Each
     message must have at least three lines and at least one line must be
     original (not quoted).  The one who enters the 75 messages in the
     shortest time wins.  Penalties will be assessed for each message which
     actually pertains to the topic of the echo.  The use of offline
     readers is prohibited.

     >> Power Quoting <<
     The winner will have made the longest continual quotation with the
     shortest vaguely pertinent reply.  The current world record is 382
     lines of quotes with a five word reply.

     >> Tagline Topping <<
     Medals are awarded in the following categories: Annoying, Childish,
     Funny, Gross and Stupid.  There is also a special all-around medal for
     the tagline which best combines all five attributes.

     the screen entirely.

     >> Platform Diving <<

     comments about everyone and everything in FidoNet.  Timing is
     critical, as the competitor must dive off the platform before his/her
     access to the net is revoked.

     >> Heavyweight Ego Lifting <<
     In this event the posturing which procedes the lift can be more
     important than the lift itself.

     >> Full Contact Flaming <<
     What would a FidoNet Olympics be without its symbol, the flame?


     }} Sysop Events {{

     >> 5 MB Packet Toss <<
     The gold medal goes to the Sysop whose system can dearchive, toss,
     sort, link and julienne a 5 MB mail packet in the shortest time.

     The winner is the Sysop who can cause the most dup-loops in the most
     different echoes in one day of operation.

     >> Synchronized Polling <<
     The winning Sysop pair will be the one whose systems synchronize
     their polls to each other the longest (without getting through).

     After the events are over everyone will be hanging out at the Olympic

     Could this happen to YOU?
     By Unknown

     Dear John [Mary].....

        To my darling Husband [Wife].

        I am sending you this letter in a bogus software company envelope
     so that you will be sure to read it.  Please forgive the deception,
     but I thought you should know what has been going on at home since
     your Node Coordinator position entered our lives two years ago.

        The children are doing well.  Tommy is seven now and is a bright,
     handsome boy.  He has developed quite an interest in the arts.  He
     drew a family portrait for a school project.  All the likenesses were
     good but yours was excellent!  The chair and the back of your head are
     very realistic.  You would be very proud of him.

        Little Jennifer turned three in September.  She looks a lot like
     you did at that age.  She is an attractive child and quite smart.  She
     still remembers that you spent the whole afternoon with her on her
     birthday.  What a grand day for Jen, despite the fact that it was
     stormy and the electricity was out.

        I am also doing well.  I went blond [met a blond] about a year ago
     and was delighted to discover that it really is more fun!

        Lars [Laura] , I mean Mr. [Ms.] Swenson, my department head, has
     taken an interest in my career and has become a good friend to us all.
     I have discovered that the household chores are much easier since I
     realized that you don't mind being vacuumed but that feather dusting
     made you sneeze.

     FIDONEWS 13-31               Page 26                  29 Jul 1996


        The house is in good shape.  I had the living room painted last
     Spring.  I'm not sure if you noticed it.  I made sure the painters cut
     air holes in the drop cloth so you wouldn't be disturbed.

        Well, my dear, I must be going.  Uncle [Aunt] Lars [Laura], Mr.
     [Ms.] Swenson, I mean, is taking us all on a ski trip and there will
     be packing to do.  I have hired a housekeeper to take care of things
     while we are away.  She'll keep things in order, fill your coffee cup,
     and bring meals to your desk, - just the way you like it.  I hope you
     and the computer have a lovely time while we are gone.  Tommy, Jen and
     I will think of you often.  Try to remember us while your Nodelists
     are compiling.

        Love, Mary [John]
        (Your Wife) (Your Husband)

                           QUESTION OF THE WEEK
     =================================================================


     FidoNews has been publishing for over ten years.  Except for a few
     missed Issues, that's close to 600 Issues.

     The Question of the Week is:

         Does anyone have ALL the FidoNews Issues in one place and if so,
         WHERE is that place and are they all available for file-request
         or download or ftp via the InterNet?

     Respond to FidoNews or via Netmail or in the FIDONEWS Echo now
     available on the Zone 1 Backbone and in Zones 2 and 3 last I heard.

     Thanks.
