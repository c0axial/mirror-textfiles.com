     =================================================================
                                 ARTICLES
     =================================================================

                   David, it's time for you to step aside

     David, I feel it's time for you to step aside.  You have served
     FidoNet well, but I believe the time has come when you can serve
     it best by resigning your position as International Coordinator.

     I've tried to express this to you privately, and quietly shared
     these concerns with a number of people in key positions in
     FidoNet.  I've hesitated from making a public statement to this
     effect, as have others, because I'm sure my words will be twisted
     and used by those who regard you as Satan Incarnate.  However, I
     see far too many cases where other people's silence is being
     interpreted as support for your actions, much to their detriment
     and the detriment of FidoNet as a whole.

     For the record, I do not question your motives.  I believe you
     have, in all cases, acted in good faith and to the best of your
     abilities, under extremely adverse circumstances.  Further, I
     believe the root problems are not of your creation - simply that
     the situation has gone beyond your ability to deal with it.


     Fundamental Problems

     Poor Communications Skills

     The fundamental problem it is paradoxical to have a
     communications network headed by someone with limited
     communications (and for that matter, technical) skills.

     Simply stated, you do not effectively use the tools at your
     disposal to communicate with the body of FidoNet.  When you do
     share your thinking directly with the network, very often the
     chapter and verse don't reflect what you really think.  More
     importantly, you don't share your thinking often enough, even
     with the upper echelons of the network.


     Burnout

     It is my personal observation that you are burned out.  You've
     talked about resignation with me and others.  My feeling is that
     if you've considered it as much as you have, you probably should.

     Would you be happier not being IC?  If the answer is yes, then by
     definition, you can't be doing the best possible job.

     I can tell you I'm happier not being an RC.  I have more time to
     code, which is what I do best in service to the net and myself.
     Your experience with internet gateways and medical conferencing
     will result, in the long run, in more good than your service as
     IC.  I hate to quote trite EST-isms, but there is logic in
     FidoNews 5-44                Page 2                   31 Oct 1988


     "Putting your good where it will do the best".  You are a doctor,
     not a manager or politician or technician.


     Erratic Management

     The network is being managed in an extremely erratic manner.  I
     do not question your right to have made many of the decisions you
     have, or even the logic.  But I do have problems with the manner
     in which nearly all the top level decisions have been made over
     the past three to five months.

     Decisions have been on-again, off-again, and are not evenly
     applied across regions.  It's difficult to say if this is a basic
     problem, or a symptom of the communications problem - but it
     hardly matters; as problems go, this one has taken on a life of
     its own.


     Making Decisions for the Wrong Reasons

     You are making decisions for the wrong reasons.  Even if the
     decisions happen to be right, that doesn't mitigate anything.  To
     say it does approaches Machiavellian (The Ends Justify the
     Means.)


     An Irretreivable Situation

     Essentially, I believe your "mandate" has been so badly eroded
     that even if you started to communicate, and even if sound
     decisions were evenly made and applied, little or no progress
     would be made.

     FidoNet is in stalemate.  In FidoNet, perception is reality.  I
     don't believe you can overcome your perception in FidoNet, and
     therefore, the reality is the best way to break the stalemate is
     for you to step aside.


     Ancillary Comments

     You can't find a replacement if you don't look

     The thing that convinced me to step aside from my position as RC
     was an argument that destroyed my principal reason for staying -
     I didn't see anyone willing and able to do the job.  But one very
     wise sysop kept telling me I'd never find one if I didn't let
     people know the job was available.

     You might not see a suitable replacement for yourself; I see
     several (NOT ME!), and I'm sure there are others that've not
     occurred to me.


     Every "Major Player" I've talked to agrees with this
     FidoNews 5-44                Page 3                   31 Oct 1988


     I've talked to a number of people in key positions in
     FidoNet/IFNA, and many influential sysops.  I've yet to talk to
     anyone who feels differently.  They all understand that your
     resignation will be regarded as a victory for this faction or
     that, and loudly cheered here and there.  But that will ALWAYS be
     true, and is therefore a moot point.

     I'd like to see those sysops I've spoken to, and any others that
     agree, to rationally, logically express their thoughts on the
     matter, preferably in some public forum.  If you disagree, do the
     same.

     But I'd like to ask the sysops who are screaming for David's head
     to stop.  Don't stop because I ask - be pragmatic and
     self-serving.  Look at it this way - do you respond logically to
     ad-hominum attacks?  Or do you become more stubborn, and dig in?
     EVERY one of the sysops referred to a couple of paragraphs back
     cites a common reason for not being more forthright in expressing
     their thoughts - they don't want to be used as fodder by this
     faction or that.


     A Clean Sweep

     I believe there are many people in the upper echelons of the
     network who are similarly burned out.  Given that the ZEC is
     resigning, and I'm advocating the IC resign, I believe EVERY
     regional level coordinator should submit their resignations, and
     more than a couple should be accepted.

                     An Attempt to Personalize FidoNet
                         A New Column for FidoNews


     FidoNet is not a collection of computers.  It's a collection of
     people, some of whom use computer bulletin boards and some of
     whom run computer bulletin boards.  Judging from echomail, we
     sometimes get confused and forget that there is a person sitting
     back there behind that net/node address.  It's pretty easy to
     treat people like they are computers (without feelings) when you
     have never met them, and don't know anything about them.

     I know that I can't introduce all 3500 sysops in FidoNet with a
     column in FidoNews, but I'm going to try to provide a bit of
     background on some of the more interesting players.  Maybe this
     will even lower the flame level in echomail by the slightest
     amount.  If it does, it's worth it.  At any rate, it will give me
     an outlet for an occasional editorial comment, as well as give
     all of us insight into who these people are that we "talk with".

     So each week you can look forward with baited breath for a few
     juicy tidbits about someone whose name you probably know.  This
     week you'll meet Rick Moore, the new head of the FTSC.  Next week
     is Tom Hendricks, who is to head up the certification process for
     FidoNet-compatible software.  After that -- well, let me know who
     you would like to know about.  A brief netmail note to 115/777,
     and I'll do what I can.  In the absence of direction, I plan to
     go after the IFNA board of directors and a number of other
     colorful characters whose names keep popping up in echomail.

     If you like the column, let me know.  If you don't let me know
     that, too.  If you want to be kind, let me know how I might
     improve it.  And if you would like to be featured, send in your
     bio!

                                Fredric L. Rice
                                  (103/503.3)


     During  the  entire  Discovery  mission,   the   Jet   Propulsion
     Laboratory  in  Pasadena  offered  the  ham radio community a two
     meter downlink  of  the  air-ground  voice  communications  link.
     Through    several   repeater   systems   owned   privately   and
     governmentally, the ham radio world and short wave receiver world
     were able to monitor much of what was said through this link.

     Because of the many satellite and repeater links  used  to  bring
     the  signal  into  the  Southern  California  area,  and the many
     problems we had with unauthorized transmitters attempting to  jam
     the  NASA  broadcast,  many  gaps  and  system failures occurred,
     causing breaks in the link.

     In  addition,  as  the  shuttle  moved  between  ground   station
     communication  facilities  and, indeed, between radio black outs,
     there are  some  gaps  in  the   transcribed  audio-tape-to-paper
     article.

     I am attempting to obtain  a  proper  recording  of  the  mission
     commanders  comments  right  before  the press conference. It's a
     fitting comment for our space efforts and I  felt  angry  at  the
     person  who was able to overpower the downlink causing me to miss
     the recording session, (the jammer  was  caught  within  seconds;
     Doppler  direction finding equipment; is now cooling it in county
     lock up for frigging with a utility).

     Here, then, is a somewhat scratchy copy of the press  conference.
     I  might add that I have transcribed the flight starting from two
     hours to touch down and will be posting all of that as well.

     Note: For the benefit of the MENSA members in our network, LOS is
     short for Loss Of Signal and  AOS  is  short  for  Acquisition Of
     Signal. TV is short for television.

     [] Gazing outside, we  can  understand  why  mankind  has  looked
     towards  the  heavens with awe and wonder since the dawn of human
     existence.

     We can comprehend why our countrymen have been driven to  explore
     the vast expanse of space.

     We are convinced that this is the road, the road  that  Americans
     must  travel to maintain the dream of our constitution. To secure
     the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our prosperity.

     As we, the crew of Discovery, witness this Earthly splendor  from
     Americas  spacecraft  less  than  200  miles separate us from the
     remainder of mankind. In a fraction of a second, our words  reach
     your  ears.   But  less  we  ever  forget  that  these  few miles
     represent a great gulf.  That to ascend  through  this  seemingly
     FidoNews 5-44                Page 6                   31 Oct 1988


     tranquil  sea  will always be fraught with danger let us remember
     the Challenger crew who's voyage was so  tragically  short.  With
     that  we  shared  a  common purpose; with that we shared a common
     goal.

     At this moment, our places in the heavens makes us feel closer to
     them  than  ever  before.  Those on the Challenger who have flown
     before have seen these sights; they would know the meaning of our
     these thoughts.

     Those who had gone to view them for the first  time;  they  would
     know  why  we set forth. They were our fellow soul journeys. They
     were our friends.

     Today, up here where the blue sky turns to black, we can  say  at
     long  last,  to  Dick,  Mike,  Judy,  [],  "Dear friends, we have
     resumed the journey that we promised to continue  for  you.  Dear
     friends, your loss has ment that we could begin anew [] that your
     spirit and your dreams, are still alive in our hearts".

     - - -

     They would have thought their deaths to have been in vain  had we
     stumbled  completely,  only  to fall back silently, forever. They
     would have though their sacrifice meaningless were we never again
     to venture upwards.

     It is hoped that for those they left behind, some  small  measure
     of  comfort  can  be  gained  by witnessing the strength of those
     Brave who have followed them: The crew of Discovery; Who made  it
     all right again.

     - - -

     H: Discovery, over to you.

     D: Ok, go ahead.

     H: Discovery? On behalf of the Challenger families, and all of us
        down here, it sure  does  feel  good  to  see  the  Challenger
        mission continue and America back in space.

        And now Discovery, we have a good downlink from  the  middeck,
        if you're ready  to start  with the  press  conference,  we'll
        start with the voice check and then ...

     D: Roger, we're ready.

     H: GSCPAO, this is Houston, please go ahead with your call.

     G: Discovery, this is GSCPAO, were ready  to  proceed  with  this
        news conference if  you are. Ok, the  first question  is  from
        Laura Collie of the Associated Press.

     Associated Press: Commander [] you said before  the  flight  that
        you  expected  to  see  some surprises?  Can  you tell us what
     FidoNews 5-44                Page 7                   31 Oct 1988


        surprises you've seen in this flight?

     D: Well I guess the first surprise right after lift off; we had a
        caution and warning tone; actually an alert tone which got our
        attention real quick. And gave us a  few  moments  to  concern
        ourselves about it and we also has a problem with  one  of our
        flash evaporators; those are technical problems, I guess I was
        rather pleased that I wasn't surprised at  how much  I enjoyed
        it up here though, we clearly  enjoy  being  up  here  in this
        tremendous machine and seeing the beautiful sites we've seen.

     ABC: Gentlemen, you are all veterans of space flight, [], all  of
        you, is there any difference in being back in space? What have
        you observed  and do you  feel different or  does it  feel the
        same?

     D: [] to say that I think its surprising to see how little it has
        changed, I think all of us; we've got to space really quickly,
        and  communications with mission  control, seem like it really
        hasn't been two and  a half years.  I think that  everyone was
        adapt in their jobs that we had to do and i think  we got back
        in business very well.

     CNN: Gentlemen your wives said the other day  that  watching  the
        launch they were filled with excitement but also fear that  it
        was wonderful and  awful at the  same time.  I'm interested in
        your feelings as you took off.

     D: [] I think I speak for the crew when I  say  I  think  it  was
        really wonderful  when we lifted  off, it certainly  was a lot
        more anxiety producing than we anticipated, at  least  I   had
        throughout the entire assent, I had forgotten what it was like
        to accelerate to at  two gees for  a sustained period  of time
        and how helpless you really feel during that time period.

     []: You have flown before but after this  flight  is  over,  what
        special moment do you want to tell your family about?

     D: I think there are going to be an awfully lot of  moments  that
        I'm going to be telling my family about, so many  things  that
        we've  shared up here;  I think some  of the Earth  views that
        we've seen and some  of the  night time scenes  and the stars,
        those are just  so indescribable  that  I []  pictures back to
        them but I'll try my best to describe them.

     [] very busy  up  there  at  times.  Was  your  flight  plan  too
        conservative and would your time have been better spent with a
        busier flight plan?

     D: I think we've been very busy. Here in the middeck  we've  done
        twelve different scientific experiments of one sort or another
        and the days have seen very full. In the future we hope to get
        back into the business off putting on space suits and building
        space  stations and repairing satellites  but theirs a  lot of
        good science that can be done in this facility that you see us
        in right now.

     Aviation Week: To follow on  your  opening,  and  Daves  comments
        there a moment  ago, can you  tell us specifically  of some of
        the more spectacular sites you've seen around the world? And
        let's go to Pinky.

     D: [] well I guess I'll delay it into three different parts... In
        the daytime we've had some spectacular ... [los]

     Ground: We'll pick that up when we get back

     D: ... for us and big cities down their and the sky at night is a
        completely different view; we spend  some  time  just  looking
        with our  eyes and some time looking with our  low  eye  level
        cameras, they've given us some views that I've always  enjoyed
        seeing in  the  Southern  Hemisphere  and  have  been dragging
        people to the windows  showing them the  imaginary  clouds and
        the southern cross.

     []: I have a question for Rick, or Dick: Can  you  give  us  some
        idea of your flight plan for  tomorrow; your  landing patterns
        and what land marks you'll be looking for as you come in.

     D: Well we'll be coming in just about  between  Los  Angeles  and
        Santa Barbara  over  coast  about  a  hundred []  the  weather
        permits and the winds permit to  land  on  Edwards  runway 17.
        We'll pass overhead the field at about  40,000  feet  becoming
        subsonic you all can hear as; we all become  supersonic you'll
        hear a double sonic boom. When you hear that you'll know we're
        about five minutes from landing. Then  we'll make our standard
        approach; three hundred miles an hour coming  down to a  touch
        down coming to about  two hundred miles  an hour on  that lake
        bed.

     Orlando Sentinel: This is for Mike: there are two men running for
        president. What would you say to  them  from  the  shuttle  to
        convince them to fully support the space program and its  long
        term future even if it means putting up budget  increases  for
        NASA at a time of considerable deficits?

     D: That's a tough one. I think we have to  take  the  long  view;
        this is a very important flight simply because it's  the first
        step and I would hope that  all of  the enthusiasm that  we've
        seen across the country for  this  flight []  the  dozens  and
        dozens of flights that we have before us if we are to make the
        space program grow to the  point that it needs  to grow to get
        us on the path to the future.

     []: Discovery gentlemen, the Challenger crew  set  out  to  teach
        some very important lessons they felt  to the children of  the
        world, I would like to know  what you would hope  what lessons
        would be taken from your flight and the  effort it took to get
        to where you are today.

     D: I've got a couple of young daughters and I know that  []  what
        I've done that there's always a reward  for  hard  work,  both
        individually and as a group. Much like the effort that was put

     Channel 13 Houston: For commander [] [] truly told  us  yesterday
        that quote NASA really threaded the needle on your launch with
        the extra emphasis  on safety and with  a  lot of  flexibility
        apparently in the long schedule  do you think that  the launch
        came a little too close to violating safety criteria.

     D: [] I understand your question; do you think the launch came to
        close to violating safety criteria. Not from  my  perspective.
        That is,  we were  very comfortable  with the lift off  as  it
        executed; we though the launch team  as a matter of fact after
        low engine cut off  we were  complimentary within ourselves to
        the launch team  with  they  way  they  handled  a  few  minor
        anomalies,  I'll call  them,  down  close  to the launch;  the
        question  of  our  cabin  pressure  and  so  forth.  From  our

     San Francisco Chronicle: I have a question for Pinky as a trained
        research scientist, can you  tell  us  how  well  the  several
        experiments that you have managed could have been  executed by
        automated equipment on a spacecraft with no people on board.

     D: Well to be honest with you, a number of these could have been.
        The advantage of running them in the mode we have... [los] ...
        have built prototypes and test out new types of experiments.

     Ground: We read you loud and clear at GSC News center, Discovery,

     New York Times: fulfilled all the objectives of your mission  and
        what recommendations do you have for changes in the orbiter?

     D: Well, Tom, The machine itself has  worked  superbly,  I'm  not
        sure  we have  had a mission  that has been  this trouble free
        with an orbiter before.  I've had  to [] I guess  we have a []
        with our [] entry  suits for  the first  time since  the first
        four missions; we do find these to be  a bit of an encumbrance

        we'll need to talk very seriously about what  is a,  I'll call
        it a bit of a compromise, [] the suit gives us  should we have
        a problem  and the fact  that it  does not allow  is quite the
        flexibility that we've had before. I guess  that's  the  major
        one, and I can't think of any others.

     D: What did he say?

     Ground: He said what is the hispanic  contribution  to  space  so
        far.

     D: I'd say theirs no doubt about it. We've got tens of  thousands
        of people  throughout the United  States that have   worked on
        the space program and I think that every race, every  minority
        group is  represented; maybe not be represented to  the degree
        that that group would  like to  be []  the  country []  to the
        various [] and the contractors we have spoken with a number of
        hispanics and [] we worked  closely with at  the Johnson space
        center and I think it's really a  contribution of the American
        People. That really were very proud of.

     USA Today: Rick, we have heard a lot of these past few days about
        the cabin getting warm.  Can you  tell us  how comfortable are
        you and the  rest of  the crew as far as the cabin temperature
        and what []

     D: It was a little warmer than it is now the first couple of days
        of the flight because of  the flash evaporator  problem. Today
        we seem to have gotten that working well, we have been boiling
        water all day long  to cool the vehicle  and I put  on a  long
        sleeve shirt and  we've  all got long  pants on  for the first
        time; It's not been bad at all, really.

        own physical and mental responses to the lift off phase of the
        mission because you had no specific task. What did you learn?

     D: We're going to have a good tolerance for heat, I  guess,  It's
        pretty warm in the suit and [] this is where I launched and []
        was sitting and I didn't have much of  a view so I  paid a lot
        of attention  to my body. It was a little  difficult to breath

     Los Angeles Times: This is a question for Rick: We  thought  they
        were going to keep you  on the ground; it was  blowing at high
        speeds in the wrong  direction. During your  assent, could you
        tell at all; did it have  any affect whatsoever on the vehicle
        when you reached thirty to forty thousand foot?

     D: [] there are forces that are masked and would be masked by the
        vibrations that we feel just  from the acoustical resonance of
        the solid rocket motors. We would not have expected to feel it
        and we did not.

        heart talks that you all might have felt yourselves during the
        flight.

     D: No possibly not, those are not the  things  you  share.  We've
        done a lot of think about  the friends that we lost  two and a
        half years ago and I've done a lot of contemplating  on  that.

     French TV: For Rick or for Pinky: When it  comes  to  safety  and

        Russia and Europe  and  Canada  and  other  countries []  some
        standards?

        how  well  we  can  manage  with  dealing  with  international
        partners? Is that correct?

     French TV: That's right;  should  we  go  gather  with  standards
        procedures and even equipment.

     [pause]

     D: If the question is how we are going to handle international []
        within our own program, I think  you do that  through planning
        ahead of time through standards  that you set  and through the
        procedures that you use so that by the time you get around  to
        flying with an international  group or an  international crew,

     D: [] Bob Criffin for the outstanding job that he did.  From  our
        prospective and pulling that out of the gutter  and  its  been
        our understanding of  course in our  last few days  before the
        launch  that was  a  many  month  effort  and  I  though  that
        management team;  all that I saw  in close at the  FIR for the

        very happy and I think that spoke very  well for the way we do

     Voice of America: You've been taking photos of phenomena on Earth

        What have  you observed their that  might be  of value  to the
        people in those areas?

     D: I think that the biggest things that we've seen are the things
        like  deforestations. We  seen erosions. We've seen some  land
        usage that  kind  of disturbed us.  I think  that it' s a good
        lesson that  we take  back those  photos to  men on  Earth and
        their respected countries. To make sure that they take care of
        what nature has given  us and  to make  sure it's used wisely.
        Our environment is a very fragile thing  and  it' s  something
        that were very  impressed by when  we take photos  and we look

     D: Yes, [laughter from the middeck], yes we do  as  a  matter  of
        fact, I think  that if  we  were  a  crew  of  one,  that  the
        possibility of getting  distracted by the  beautiful sites and
        the fun of being  up here could  perhaps cause you  to not pay
        attention to  what  you' re  doing.  The  crew  concept  is  a
        wonderful thing and it keeps us on our toes.

        the same solutions and there's a team of science up  here that

        As I mentioned before the middeck that we're in  is  really  a

        for experiments such  as the  ones we  have onboard  that were

     D: Well, they're... Of course something that you're concerned  if
        you have  the  next failure... My  understanding right  now is
        that the flash evaporator though,  we expect it to work almost
        [] and still be in good  shape; that's also  the case with the
        [] maneuvering engines,  it's true  that we do  have one cross
        vector control system down  on the left  engine but we  have a
        back up and  we  also have  the  capability  of  locking  that
        control system in its  current position  and still deorbit and
        plus we could shut down one engine and come back on the  other
        engine  and if  that fails we could come back on our  reaction
        control system. So we have quite a back up capability here.

     It's interesting to note the posture that NASA and  friends  have
     taken  with  the  general  public  and  the worlds press. In this
     mission, safety and technological problems were the  main  issues
     instigated  from the press and to a certain extent, from NASA. It
     seems that the lift/no-lift question as regards humanware  safety
     was stressed through out the mission; primarily with the shuttles
     cooling system problem.

     In the October 17th issue of the "News", Dan Tobias was so kind
     to point out the fact that I had used the term DOS in a manner
     that was unbecoming.  I concede.  I can't believe that I used
     the term in the manner that I did, but I did.

     I violated one of my own pet peeves, I stated that I had at one
     time upgraded to a DOS machine.  What I meant to say was that I
     had finally given up a real DOS in order to become one of the
     status quo.  Yes folks, we're talking CP/M here.  You know, the
     best DOS developed by man or beast.  Such a shame that it was
     colorized like an old movie and repackaged as something new. I
     understand that Digital Research is working on a new DOS as we
     speak, I can't wait to try it out.

     So Dan, and the rest of you, go ahead and give me the wet noodle
     treatment.  I deserve it.  Maybe it's just an after effect of
     too many hours behind this MS DOS compatible machine, maybe I
     have been exposed to too many messages from the UFO echo, maybe
     it's just that I am going completely stark raving mad.....naaaa,
     it's just my way of showing how well my brain sleeps.

                NAFT Not Another File Tosser!?

                       David Rice
                       The Astro-Net
                       (1:103/503.0)



          Have you ever wished to toss your files from the Upload
     directory   to   their   assigned  directories  quickly  and
     painlessly?  It would be nice to have a program  that  reads
     in  a  selected  FILES.BBS and allow you, the SysOp, to page
     through the entries, putting a hash mark next  to  the  file
     and description  to  be  tossed.   Then with the push of one
     key, this program would copy the files one at a time, remove
     the entry from the Upload directory's FILES.BBS, append  the
     entry to the Target directory's FILES.BBS, and then kill the
     original file.

          This is just what NAFT does.

          When  one  enters  NAFT at the DOS prompt (and assuming
     that NAFT resides somewhere within the DOS Path), NAFT  will
     first  ask  for  the  Source  Path  (presumably  your Upload
     Directory).  The file FILES.BBS will be loaded  into  memory
     if  it's  found,  or an error will be displayed if it is not
     found.

          The first 19 entries will be displayed  on  the  screen
     (up  to  19,  really,  in  case  you  don't  have 19 or more
     entries).  One may use the arrow keys to place a  hash  mark
     next to the file name and description.  The hash mark may be
     any key.    To  remove a "hash mark," one would just mark it
     again.

          To get the next 19 entries, the PgDn key is hit.    For
     the previous  19,  the  PgUp  key is used.  This way one may
     mark as many files for tossing as  one  wishes,  going  back
     through the list as many times as one requires.

          One may abort the process at any time by hitting the F2
     key.  One may shell to DOS with the F10 key.

          Once  files  have been selected for tossing, the F1 key
     is hit.  Now NAFT requests the Target Path.  This  path  may
     be  on  a different disk, over the LAN, a virtual disk, or a
     floppy disk drive.  If the Target directory  does  not  have
     FILES.BBS, it will be created.

          The  files will then be tossed, with a display of which
     file is being tossed at the moment.

          The Source directory's FILES.BBS file will  be  cleaned
     up neat and pretty, with all of the entries that were tossed
     now missing, and all leading and trailing spaces in the File
     Description removed -- no extra charge.

          The  Target  directory  will now hold the tossed files,
     and it's FILES.BBS file will now hold  the  file  names  and
     descriptions.

          NAFT.EXE is  15,119 bytes large.  The archive NAFT.ARC,
     which holds the executible file and the scant  documentation
     is 12,262 bytes. Since NAFT  Requires BRUN30.EXE to run, the
     archive NAFTBR.ARC holds  the NAFT  file, the documentation,
     and BRUN30.EXE. The  files NAFT.ARC  and NAFTBR.ARC are File
     Requestable here on The Astro-Net  1:103/503.0 24 hours. The

              Sysops, BBS's, CD-ROM's, & $14 Billion Dollars

        Sysops are a rare breed!  In some ways,  one needs to be
     slightly demented to even want to run a board.   It is often a
     pain,  certainly challenging, and has been known to be
     rewarding.    The compliments are far and few between.    One
     thing is unquestionable,  the money for hardware, software, and
     the telephone company remains constant.

        Almost every sysop I talk to is always looking for
     something new for the board.   Either a new & bigger hard disk
     drive,  a faster modem,  or something.   The BBS is a
     reflection of the sysops personality.  (Hmmmmmmmmmmm! !!) Each
     board is different, carries different Echo's, has contrasting
     files,  and offers unique services.  This is one of the key
     factors involved in the fine art of "sysoping".

        CD-ROM enters the picture of bulletin boards now.  The
     introduction of large databases with public domain programs,
     is very exciting to sysops.  Now,  the sysop can add an
     enormous amount of public domain software to the system for the
     users.  CD-ROM drive prices are dropping, but they are not
     within the reach of the general populace.  Any board with a
     CD-ROM filled with public domain software is a very busy board.

        Now,  we enter with the $14 billion dollars.   Our firm,
     Ellis Enterprises,  Inc., produces The Bible Library (tm) on
     CD-ROM.  At the present,  we have several sysops acting as
     consultants ( aren't we all? ), and they are selling The Bible
     Library (tm) to the church - religious market.  Some said they
     weren't into religion, but they would pass around the brochures
     and give away some of the floppy demonstrations.

        We have a consultant or dealer kit available, which
     includes brochures and floppy demonstrations.  All one really
     needs to do is get it in the hands of a pastor, youth director,
     or even the person in charge of data processing for the church.
     (180,000 churches have computer systems!)

        Here is it's true potential for you as a dealer:
        Churches:            370,598
        Members:           159,453,086
        Contributions:  14,242,824,577.00 per year.
        Seminaries:               380
        Seminary Students:      56,335
        Clergy:                530,000+
        Donations per capita:      601.82
        Church Colleges & Univ:      782
        Religious Periodicals:       373

        This information does not include the television & radio
     ministries.  The above statistics are not current, they are a
     year old, and certainly have increased.

        The CD-ROM industry is growing!  Consider these few
     statistics for the market:
     FidoNews 5-44                Page 18                  31 Oct 1988


        180,000  CD-ROM units sold.
        800      CD-ROM databases presently on the market.
        1.1 million CD-ROM discs already shipped.

        Here is the reason for this article: you as a sysop or
     consultant,  can make up to $600 per sale for a drive and The
     Bible Library (tm).  Just a few of these types of sales,  and
     you will have the funds for your BBS.

        Ellis Enterprises,  Inc.  is making this offer to the
     many sysops out there,  and if you want more information,
     please send it to 147/23 or write:

       Attention:  Bob Hall

        All you need to do is get the information in the hands
     of the pastor,  and the rest is simply taking the order,  and
     installing the unit.  A sysop in Florida is working with a
     church for a full CD-ROM networking system.  ( $30,000 sale! )

        Thanks.  ......

                       An Introduction of Rick Moore
                             New Chair of FTSC


     FidoNet is a remarkable thing.  There are thousands of systems
     which belong to the network, and any two can connect and transfer
     mail.  The sysops need not know each other, or even know what
     software is running on the other system.  The BBS line rings, the
     modems connect, and the mail is transferred -- all routine.  The
     thing that makes this possible is the FidoNet protocol, described
     by the FidoNet Technical Standards Committee (FTSC).  The process
     started when we were all running one program -- Fido -- and the
     more complex things get, the more important it is to carefully
     document our standards.

     Rick Moore is the new head of the FidoNet Technical Standards
     Committee, and I want to provide a little introduction of Rick.
     It's only fair that my first efforts in this column should be to
     introduce my FidoNet boss, since as RC/11 Rick does serve as my
     boss in my efforts as NC/115.

     Rick brings a wealth of mainframe-based computer experience to
     this job.  He started in the mainframe game in 1969, and is
     presently employed by StatTab, a large service bureau in Chicago.
     Rick is the capacity planner for StatTab, and his responsibili-
     ties also include insuring that the disk and network subsystems
     run smoothly.  The discipline and organization inherent in main-
     frame systems is an impornant trait for the FTSC.

     Rick's computer experience is not limited to the mainframe world.
     He bought his first microcomputer, a Heath H-11, in 1977.  Rick
     has been in FidoNet since August 26, 1986.

     His contributions to FidoNet have been significant.  Rick has
     served as network coordinator of net 115 (ChicagoLand) where he
     introduced the Hub structure and guided the network through the
     introduction of echomail.  Rick has served as region coordinator
     for region 11 since March.  (He has resigned that position to
     devote full time to duties with FTSC.)

     It is in the FOSSIL area that Rick is perhaps best known.  He is
     the author of the FOSSIL for the Radio Shack T2K machine, and
     he produced the FOSSIL documentation which was distributed with
     version 5.  Rick and Vince Perriello had the idea for the video
     FOSSIL which was used in the latest version of BinkleyTerm, and
     Rick produced the documentation for that standard.

     As for the future of FTSC, Rick has some interesting plans which
     we should see unfold in the next months.  One of them is work on
     FidoNews 5-44                Page 21                  31 Oct 1988


     standards in the echomail arena.  If previous committment and
     accomplishment are any prediction of the future, I'd say we have
     a lot to look forward to.

              Rogel Corner:  Xtree 2.0 versus Tree86 1.0

                  | Introduction to Rogel's Corner |
                  ----------------------------------

     Welcome to  Rogel's Corner.   I have been writing this column
     for Triangle IBM  User' Group's monthly newsletter, PC/2.  In
     April,  1988  TIBMUG's  newsletter,  PC/2, and Rogel's Corner
     went electronic, thanks to Mike  Stroud,  a  local  SysOp who
     volunteered  an  area  for  TIBMUG  on his popular multi-line
     board, Micro Message Service [MMS 151/102].  And now . . .
     FidoNews.

     Several of  the tables,  illustrations, and  figures from the
     original  Rogel's  Corner  were  too wide for FidoNews, which
     requires narrow  margins (0,  60).   Consequently these items
     were left  out of  the version of Rogel's Corner submitted to
     FidoNews.  Actually, one Rogel's Corner  column -- addressing
     telecomputing  and  its  means,  methods, and hardware -- was
     omitted in its entirety due to the number of necessarily wide
     charts and figures.

     For those  interested in  viewing these omitted items, take a
     look at the TIBMUG's SIG on MMS, (919)  779-6674.   After you
     log on,  type "S"  for Spcial  Interest Groups,  then "4" for
     local users' groups, and  "1" for  TIBMUG.   Current and back
     issues of our newsletter may then be accessed by entering "P"
     for PC/2.

     I do not profess to be a  computer  guru.    What  I  lack in
     technical knowledge, I hope to make up with my enthusiasm and
     perseverance.  In  addition,  feedback  will  be appreciated.
     Have you  had a different experience than mine with a product
     reviewed in Rogel's Corner?  What subjects would  you like to
     see covered in future Rogel's Corner columns?  Let me know.

           | The Trees have it:  Xtree 2.0 vs. Tree86 1.0 |
           ------------------------------------------------

     It seems  like we  are always looking for a better mousetrap.
     This is certainly  evident  with  DOS  shells  and  hard disk
     management software.  There are dozens of programs that offer
     you that miracle handle on DOS  usage and  navigating through
     your file-laden hard disk.

     Some of these programs substitute their own command structure
     FidoNews 5-44                Page 23                  31 Oct 1988


     for DOS commands and,  in the  process, often  provide a less
     effective and  equally or,  perhaps, more difficult method of
     computing.  Others, such as 1Dir, offer powerful yet, to many
     people, complex and complicated features.

     This  article  provides  a  quick  and  dirty  review  of two
     programs, Xtree 2.0 and Tree86.    Both  allow  efficient and
     effective disk navigation and management, provide graphically
     attractive  and  easy  to  understand  interfaces,   and  are
     reasonably priced.


     I.   Basic information about the two programs
     ---------------------------------------------
     Xtree 2.0
     ---------

     Xtree2  by  Executive  Systems  has  been  around for several
     years.  Its popularity is due  in large  part to  the graphic
     display it offers of the hard disk directory and subdirectory
     [see  Figures  1-3].    Unlike  DOS's  "dir"  command,  Xtree
     visually   distinguishes   the   directory,   subdirectories,
     subdirectories, sub-subdirectories, etc. so that the user can
     gain a  better perspective of the hundreds of files on his or
     her disk.  The mail-order price of Xtree2 is generally in the
     $40-$50 range [PC-Connection, 1-800-243-8088; $45 per 2/16/88
     edition of PC Magazine, pg. 228] but I  have seen  it offered
     for as low as $25 [Telemart, 1-800-426-6659].

     Tree86 1.0
     ----------

     Tree86, from The Aldridge Company, 2500 CityWest Blvd., Suite
     575, Houston,  Texas  77042    713-953-1940,  uses  a similar
     graphics scheme  [see Figures  4-14].  It obviously is aiming
     at the Xtree2 market as a  "new  and  improved"  Xtree.   The
     Aldridge Company  claims that  their product  is faster, more
     attractive  graphically,  easier  to  use,  and  offers mouse
     support.   Its advertisements  claim that  it will retail for
     $49.95, it is  now  being  offered  for  a  limited  time for
     $29.95.

     II.  Program Commands
     ---------------------
     Xtree 2.0
     ---------

     Xtree2  uses  1-key  or  a control+key combination to perform
     DOS-like commands.  For example, if you look at the bottom of
     Figure 2,  which shows the files in the root directory, there
     appears a series of  commands, such  as "Attributes", "Copy",
     "Delete", "Filespec",  "Log disk",  "Move", and  "Print".  To
     copy a  single file,  you would  position the  cursor at that
     file  and   press  the  highlighted  letter  of  the  command
     (underlined in the example above), which  in this  case would
     be "C".   If  you wanted to copy more than one file you would
     FidoNews 5-44                Page 24                  31 Oct 1988


     tag the  files  you  wanted  copied--by  either  striking the
     letter "T"  when your  cursor was  on that particular file or
     striking the control key and "T" to tag  all of  the files in
     the   directory   (or   subdirectory)--and  then  striking  a
     combination of the control key and "T".

     Three  snapshops  of  various  Xtree2  windows   are  briefly
     explained below:

     Figure  1  shows  the  Main  Window,  with  the cursor in the
     directory screen [A].  The top left portion  [A] displays the
     directory  structure,  graphically  showing  where  the  Root
     directory, which is where the cursor is located, fits in with
     respect  to  the  rest  of  the  directory.   The bottom left
     portion  [B]  shows  a  portion  of  the  files  in  the Root
     directory.   The right-hand  part of  the screen [C] provides
     disk data.  The  very bottom  of the  screen [D]  reveals the
     list of "Dir Commands" available.

     Figure 2 again shows the Main Window but this time the cursor
     is in the File Window  portion  [B].    Note  that  the "File
     Commands" available [D] are somewhat different than in Figure
     1.

     Figure  3  displays  an  expanded  File  Window.    The "File
     Commands" are the same as those in Figure 2.

     Tree 86 1.0
     -----------

     Tree86 operates  in much  the same  fashion except  it uses a
     menu   system  and,  as  noted  above,  also  claims  that it
     supports the  use of  a mouse.  To illustrate, to copy a file
     you would go into the  Utility  menu,  which  is  accessed by
     striking the  "U" key  and then strike the "C" key, as can be
     seen in Figures 7 and 13 below.

     The remainder of the illustrations below  show various Tree86
     windows and the various menus available.

     Figures 4 through 8 display the Tree86 Main Window.  The menu
     command structure can be seen at the top  of the  screen [A].
     Below  that  and  on  the  left is a display of the directory
     structure [B].  Disk data is show the  menu and  to the right
     [C].  Figures 5 through 8 show individual menus.

     Figures  9  through  14  reveal  the  files  in  a particular
     subdirectory are displayed instead of the directory structure
     [B].    Note  that  the  menu  command structure for the File
     Windows [A] is different from those  for the  Main Window and
     that  there  is  no  disk  data display (instead, information
     concerning each file is shown).   Figures 10  through 14 show
     individual menus.


     III. Comparison
     FidoNews 5-44                Page 25                  31 Oct 1988


     ---------------
     Xtree 2.0
     ---------

          +    you  can  view  both  a  particular subdirectory in
               relation  to   the  (almost)   entire  directory  /
               subdirectory structure  and, at the same time, that
               particular  subdirectory's  files  [see   Figure  1
               below];

          +    the  ability  to  use  simple  1 or 2 keystrokes to
               execute a command is easier and  faster than having
               to work through a menu system;

          -    slow;  you  can  begin  an application program from
               within Xtree2, but this  requires  that  you strike
               several keys in order to do so;

          -    slow;  to  reenter  Xtree2  after  you  conclude an
               application  Xtree2  must  first  reread  the disk,
               which  can  be  time-consuming.   My frustration at
               having to go through this slowdown each time I wish
               to return  to Xtree2  has led me to limit my use of
               Xtree2 to those  few  times  when  I  must dedicate
               myself to  perform serious "housekeeping" chores on
               my  disk.     During   my  day-to-day   use  of  my
               applications  programs,  I  avoid  Xtree2  like the
               plague; and

          -    inconsistent;  I  sometimes  have  been  unable  to
               return to Xtree2 without recalling it from DOS.

     Tree86 1.0
     ----------

          +    it is  easy to move between Tree86 and applications
               programs.  To run a program, you simply  strike the
               "R"  key  from  within  Tree86  and  you are up and
               running in your applications program [see  Figure 9
               below].     When  you   conclude  the  applications
               program, you strike any  key and  you are instantly
               back in Tree86.  Tree86 does not automatically read
               the disk each time you access it and this can  be a
               real time  saver (of course, you have the choice of
               having Tree86  read the  disk whenever  you want an
               updated  view  of  your  disk--see Figures 6 and 12
               below );

          +    Tree86 permits you to  quickly bring  any file into
               your  wordprocessor  by  striking  the "E" key (you
               must create a simple batch file to do  this:  i.e.,
               "Editor.bat" with the command "wp %1") (see Figures
               4 and 9 below);

          +    Tree86 also allows you to quickly  enter a DOS-like
               environment and then return to Tree86;

          +    Tree86 has  a useful file-finding feature.  You can
               conduct a quick search  for  a  particular  file or
               group  of   files  (i.e.,  all  *.doc  files)  [see
               Figures 6 and  8  below].    In  addition,  you can
               easily find  all duplicate  files on your hard disk
               [see Figure 8 below];

          -    The mandatory menu system  is personally cumbersome
               and annoying; and

          -    I prefer  the "larger" picture of both subdirectory
               structure together with the files in a subdirectory
               that Xtree2 offers but Tree86 does not.


     IV.  Conclusion
     ---------------

     Both  Xtree2  or  Tree86  are  useful  programs.  Whether you
     should use one or  the other  or, for  that matter,  any disk
     management/navigation  program   is  a   matter  of  personal
     preference.  Unquestionably one can profitably use his or her
     computer without such assistance.

     Yet I  enjoy the  convenience these programs offer me as well
     as the ability to keep constant tabs on the status of my disk
     and  thereby  keep  my  electronic  office  clean  and  under
     control.  While I  find  that  Xtree2  has  a  slight certain
     advantage in terms of disk navigation, this is far outweighed
     by the full-service features of Tree86.

     Of course, the rumor mill has  it  that  a  new  and improved
     Xtree is on its way.  This may be Xtree Pro 1.0.  I asked the
     folks at PC-Connection [they  are selling  Xtree Pro  1.0 for
     $69] who told me that it is a more powerful version of Xtree2
     and includes  the ability  to use  DOS commands  but they are
     unable to  tell me  whether it  has increased speed.  Alas, I
     also have been unsuccessful in  finding  anyone  else  who is
     knowledgeable about this version.

     Sincerely,
