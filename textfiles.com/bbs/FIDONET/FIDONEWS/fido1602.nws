     Greetings,

     So much has been written about how much/many Nodes FidoNet is
     loosing every week, that I have pleasure showing you a few
     messages from previous posted Nodelist stats.

     I'm not going to present you with any meaningfull or otherwise
     bull here as the figures below, speak for themselves.  Please,
     regardless whether the figures are correct or not is not the point,
     what is the point, it presents some form of demise of FidoNet in
     a manner, which is frighting.  A hobby in which I and many of you,
     have spent many hours in, not to speak of the amount of money we
     invested in it.

     As can be seen, FidoNet is loosing Nodes at a rate of some 4000 per
     annum.  At this rate, we have some 4 years to go, before it's
     history.  A very sad state of affairs.

     Not so happy reading,

     Who Decides - Douglas Myers

                                 Who Decides?
                             D. Myers, 1:270/720

     One of the consequences of being an internationally-known Fidonet
     Busybody is that I am occasionally confused with someone with
     actual influence.  Such was the case recently when Catalin Bradu of
     Romania, the RC of Region 53 sent me information he really wanted to
     get to Bob Satti.

     He was under the mistaken impression that I would have the email
     address of Fido's Top Cop.  All I have is a calling plan which lets
     me call in the US and Canada for a dime a minute, so crashing
     netmail is almost trivial.  If I'd been smart, I'd have just sent it
     along and let it go.

     It was stuff I didn't want to hear about.  He was excommunicating
     someone named Gabi Andrei for Excessively Annoying Behavior in
     proselytizing his particular brand of religion.  Though he
     apparently had the support of his region, his ZC, Ward Dossche
     ordered him to reverse his ruling.  A few days later, Ward removed
     him as RC, placing someone in charge who didn't support the EAB
     action.

     Now who wants to get involved in this?  Who wants to support someone
     proselytizing in netmail and echomail?  But then, who wants to
     support the nasty business of excommunication?  Especially in
     far-off Romania?

     Who should be making these decisions anyway?  Should Excessively
     Annoying Behavior be determined by the folks in the region where it
     occurs, or is it the province of the Zone Coordinator?

     For that matter, who decides when a popularly-elected Regional
     Coordinator should be removed.  Is it the province of his
     electorate, or is it up to the Zone Coordinator?

     David E. Waters on The Real Problem:
     -------------------------------------------------------------------
     There is no depth in Fido. For instance, there is no school for
     future Sysops. When we all die, thats it it's over. Nobody is
     trained to take over any of the "Jobs" in Fido. How many know the
     politics of how to get mail from N.A. to Austraila? (Show of hands
     please.)

     Sysoping will very quickly become a lost art like "canning" (you
     know those jars our Grandmothers had full of stuff when we were
     kids). The unreleased version of Trade Wars is a prime example, it
     ties directly through a server and does not need a BBS to run.

     I know I am a "Johnny come lately" and most folks figure I do not
     whats going on and for the most part they are right. I am also a
     locksmith and there are no new people (Kids, teenagers & young
     adults) training behind us at least not enough to keep open all the
     shops that are out there now. Which means the fewer there are the
     resource gets more expensive (think about that the next you call 2-3
     locksmiths for an estimate, what if there was only 1?).

     I'm 52 and no I do not know how old anybody else is and it really
     does not matter, we ALL die sometime. All of us better figure out
     how to solve this part first or the who is doing what will not
     matter if there is no what to do, because the mail and files will
     have stopped because somebody died and nobody could take thier
     place.
