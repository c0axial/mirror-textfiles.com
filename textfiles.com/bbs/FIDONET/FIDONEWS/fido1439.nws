     Not much new this week and a very short Issue.

     Still no Zone 2 update in the Nodelist. Still no International
     Coordinator. Still arguing in Echomail over the most insignificant
     issues.

     And I've got to go. My son just sliced a golf ball through the
     kitchen window and there's glass all over the place.

     Enjoy!

     AOP Alert 97:14                    Friday, September 26, 1997
     =============================================================

     The following is a legislative alert from the Association of
     Online Professionals, the primary professional association of
     Internet Service Providers and other professionals who manage
     online services.  Please give it the widest possible
     distribution.

     =============================================================
     Internet Issues Need Your Support
     =============================================================

     **  AOP has joined the effort to overturn a tax on Internet
         and online services in the state of Alabama.  The governor
         and legislature of that state will convene a special
         session of the legislature to overturn the implementation
         of the tax in that state.  AOP needs to locate ISPs in the
         state who have an interest in testifying before the
         legislature on this issue.  Alabama ISPs should contact
         exec@aop.org.

     **  On the Federal level, the Internet Tax Freedom Act now
         has more than 78 co-sponsors in the House of Representatives,
         but is being blocked in the Senate by Sen. Ted Stevens of
         Alaska.  Stevens wants ISPs to be taxed in order to pay for
         subsidized telephone service in Alaska under the Universal
         Service Fund.  It is imperative that people concerned about
         the future of the Internet contact Congress in support of
         the Internet Tax Freedom Act.  You may easily do this by
         visiting http://www.aop.org and clicking on the "Write
         Congress" button.

     **  Online professionals also need to support the Coble and
         Ashcroft bills to exempt IPSs from unwarranted lawsuits
         over copyright.  Congress needs to hear from you immediately
         on this issue.  You may easily do this by visiting
         http://www.aop.org and clicking on the "Write Congress"
         button.

     Deep Thoughts Contest

       -- From a newspaper contest where entrants were asked to imitate
       "Deep Thoughts by Jack Handey"

          HONORABLE MENTIONS:

       My young son asked me what happens after we die.  I told him we get
       buried under a bunch of dirt and worms eat our bodies.  I guess I
       should have told him the truth--that most of us go to Hell and burn
       eternally--but I didn't want to upset him.

       It sure would be nice if we got a day off for the president's
       birthday, like they do for the queen.  Of course, then we would have
       a lot of people voting for a candidate born on July 3 or December
       26, just for the long weekends.

       Democracy is a beautiful thing, except for that part about letting
       just any old yokel vote.

       Home is where the house is.

       Often, when I am reading a good book, I stop and thank my teacher.
       That is, I used to, until she got an unlisted number.

       As you make your way through this hectic world of ours, set aside a
       few minutes each day.  At the end of the year, you'll have a couple
       of days saved up.

       It would be terrible if the Red Cross Bloodmobile got into an
       accident.  No, wait.  That would be good because if anyone needed
       it, the blood would be right there.

       Give me the strength to change the things I can, the grace to accept
       the things I cannot, and a great big bag of money.

       The people who think Tiny Tim is strange are the same ones who think
       it odd that I drive without pants.

       For centuries, people thought the moon was made of green cheese.
       Then the astronauts found that the moon is really a big hard rock.
       That's what happens to cheese when you leave it out.

       Think of the biggest number you can.  Now add five.  Then, imagine
       if you had that many Twinkies.  Wow, that's five more than the
       biggest number you could come up with!

       I bet living in a nudist colony takes all the fun out of Halloween.

       The only stupid question is the one that is never asked, except
       maybe "Don't you think it is about time you audited my return?" or
       "Isn't is morally wrong to give me a warning when, in fact, I was
       speeding?"

       Once, I wept for I had no shoes.  Then I came upon a man who had no
       feet.  So I took his shoes.  I mean, it's not like he really needed
       them, right?

       When I go to heaven, I want to see my grandpa again.  But he better
       have lost the nose hair and the old-man smell.

       I believe you should live each day as if it is your last, which is
       why I don't have any clean laundry because, come on, who wants to
       wash clothes on the last day of their life?

       I often wonder how come John Tesh isn't as popular a singer as some
       people think he should be.  Then, I remember it's because he sucks.

       Whenever I start getting sad about where I am in my life, I think
       about the last words of my favorite uncle: "A truck!"

       If you really want to impress people with your computer literacy,
       add the words "dot com" to the end of everything you say, dot com.

       I like to go down to the dog pound and pretend that I've found my
       dog.  Then I tell them to kill it anyway because I already gave away
       all of his stuff.  Dog people sure don't have a sense of humor.

       THIRD RUNNER UP

       I don't know about you, but I enjoy watching paint dry.  I imagine
       that the wet paint is a big freshwater lake that is the only source
       of water for some tiny cities by the lake.  As the lake gets drier,
       the population gets more desperate, and sometimes there are water
       riots.  Once there was a big fire and everyone died.

       SECOND RUNNER UP

       I once heard the voice of God.  It said "Vrrrrmmmmm."  Unless it was
       just a lawn mower.

       FIRST RUNNER UP
     FIDONEWS 14-39               Page 6                   29 Sep 1997


       I gaze at the brilliant full moon.  The same one, I think to myself,
       at which Socrates, Aristotle, and Plato gazed.  Suddenly, I imagine
       they appear beside me.  I tell Socrates about the national debate
       over one's right to die and wonder at the constancy of the human
       condition.  I tell Plato that I live in the country that has come
       the closest to Utopia, and I show him a copy of the Constitution.  I
       tell Aristotle that we have found many more than four basic elements
       and I show him a periodic table.  I get a box of kitchen matches and
       strike one.  They gasp with wonder.  We spend the rest of the night
       lighting farts.

       WINNER

       If we could just get everyone to close their eyes and visualize
       world peace for an hour, imagine how serene and quiet it would be
       until the looting started.
