                            CALLNY......The Echo

     Have you been to NY lately?  Would you like to go?  Are you from
     NY originally?  Would you just like to chat with folks in the
     Big Apple?

     There are thousands of transplanted New Yorkers.  People, like
     me, who grew up in the Big Apple and moved away.  We left alot
     of friends behind.  And you folks in NY, how about visiting with
     us transplanted NYers?  We're sure you've friends you grew up
     with but have since lost touch with when they moved away.
     Perhaps we can help you find each other again.  You know it's
     very true what they say, "You can take the person out of NY but
     you can't take NY out of the person!"  We who left will always
     have a little of NY in us.

     Seems there is a whole bunch of us ex-Nyers scattered all over
     the place and we want to have a nice place to get together.  And
     there are some folks who just want to see what NY is like, the
     armchair way.

     Here's the way to do it!  CALLNY is the echo for you!  We have
     been chatting away for about a month down in the Southeast and
     it's time to share with everyone else.

     Join us and CALLNY.

     Though working on getting this echo on the backbone, we need to
     know who you are who want to take this echo and we're PC
     Pursuitable!

     GARBAGE IN, BUT NO GARBAGE OUT

     Humans have always had garbage.  For most of the past two-and-a-
     half million years, they left it where it fell and moved on.
     Garbage first became a crisis as humans became sedentary - when,
     rather than move themselves, they decided to move their trash.
     That pivotal decision gave rise to a need for a class of people
     that could deal with the mountains of rubbish.  This solution
     worked so well it is still in place today.  In Cairo, for
     example, generations of rural immigrant families eke out a living
     in the municipal dumps, salvaging everything useable.

     Modern landfills are quite different.

     Visualize a landfill.  Do you imagine it as a monstrous mountain
     of smoldering food, yard waste, and building materials, mixed
     with piles of polystyrene foam packaging and plastic junk?  How
     much of a landfill is made up of plastic packaging?  Ask the
     person on the street and the answers may be 20, 30, even 50
     percent.

     Those figures could make a solid waste educator feel smug and
     self-righteous.  If only it were true!

     Dr. William Rathje is a renowned anthropologist/archaeologist.
     For decades he has been excavating landfills to see what,
     exactly, is in them.  His conclusions are quite different than
     what we may imagine.

     Rathje's "Garbage Project" spent two years exhuming 16,000 pounds
     of trash, weighing all items and sorting them into 27 basic
     categories and then into 162 subcategories.

     * In those eight tons of garbage he found only 16 pounds of fast-

     food packaging, about a tenth of 1 percent.

     * The entire category of plastic was less than 5 percent of the
     landfill's contents by weight and 12 percent by volume.

     He determined the real culprit in landfills is paper.  Paper
     accounts for 40 percent to 50 percent of everything we throw
     away.  He wrote in The Atlantic Monthly, December, 1989:
     "If fast-food packaging is the Emperor's New Clothes of garbage,
     then a number of categories of paper goods collectively deserve
     the role of Invisible Man.  Dig a trench through a landfill and
     you will see layers of phone books, like geological strata or
     layers of cake.  Just as conspicuous as telephone books are new-

     FidoNews 7-39                Page 3                   24 Sep 1990


     papers, which make up 10 percent to 18 percent of the contents
     of a typical municipal landfill by volume.  Even after several
     years of burial they are usually well preserved.  During a recent
     dig in Phoenix, I found newspapers dating back to 1952 that
     looked so fresh you might read one over breakfast.  Deep within
     landfills, copies of that New York Times editorial about fast-
     food containers will remain legible until well into the next
     century."

     Another shocking discovery:  The concept of biodegradability in a
     landfill environment is myth.

     The reality is that the garbage is entombed and mummified.  This
     destroys the credibility of degradable plastics.  Rathje's team
     has found perfectly preserved ears of corn dating from 1971.  If
     the landfill microbes don't eat these, they won't be drawn to the
     minuscule amount of edible corn starch in a "biodegradable"
     plastic bag or diaper.

     What does an eco-warrior say when confronted with such proof?  I
     say RECYCLING is still the answer.

     That New York Times has no business in the landfill!  Newspaper
     recycling is in place in virtually every city and town.  In some
     areas it is currently worthless to the recycler, but that will
     change as the demand catches up with the supply.  In Washington,
     legislation is in place to revise freight rates, making it
     cheaper to transport recycled paper than to transport wood for
     pulp.

     U.S. West of Washington State has responded to public pressure
     and is exploring new markets for recycled phone books, such as
     animal bedding and insulation.  The books could be made recyclable
     by using a better grade of paper and having only a strip of yellow
     mark the Yellow Pages.  The phone company can help municipalities
     set up recycling programs for these predictable yearly waves of
     waste.

     WHAT CAN YOU DO?

     * Become part of the pressure and call your telephone company
     and/or producer of your telephone book.

     * Purchase recycled paper products at home and at work.  These
     are typically more expensive, but that will only change when
     more people demand recycled products.  Available materials range
     from computer paper to toilet tissue.

     * Talk or write to the government.  Government agencies use far
     more paper than any other institutions.  They have a
     responsibility to use recycled paper.

     FidoNews 7-39                Page 4                   24 Sep 1990


     * How about your children's schools?  In a pilot program at a
     local Junior High, the students have recycled more than a ton of
     high-grade paper in six months.  The loop will be complete when
     the paper we recycle is recycled paper.  Volunteer to help.

     * Continue to reject plastic that is not in the form of a
     durable, reusable item.  Know that any "biodegradable" plastic
     is a scam.

     * Since landfill garbage just sits around, make sure only things
     that belong in landfills go there.  Support the recycling
     industry by purchasing recycled products.  Choose containers with
     proven value in the world marketplace; cardboard, glass and
     metal.

     When we are truly committed to these actions, we can begin to see
     ourselves as masters of our garbage not slaves of a "Throw away
     society".

                 On Lharc and FidoNet - my three bits' worth

       Luke Kolin, 1:250/1@fidonet

       I must admit that I got quite a surprise when I started re-
     ceiving my FidoNews in LHARC format. Now I've always been one
     to advocate the progression of standards, but I'm afraid that
     this entire lharc FIASCO has shown to FidoNet the pitfalls
     of political games.
       Vince Periello wears two hats, that of programmer, and that
     of network official, namely, Editor of FidoNews. As a pro-
     grammer, he has the choice to use whichever compression util-
     ity he chooses for his software. Out of his own beliefs, he
     chooses LHARC. I choose PKZIP, but again, this is my personal
     decision.

       However, as Editor of FidoNews, he is not allowed to make
     personal decisions. Any technical changes that he wishes to
     implement MUST be made after lengthy consultations with others.
     Vince, you're no longer acting according to your own beliefs.
     It's a much higher calling. More is expected of you. It is
     up to you to put the network's best interests to heart.
       And using LHARC is not in the network's best interest. Many
     people have risen up to complain about the way this switch was
     done. Vince, listen to them! This discussion isn't closed, not
     by a long shot. They don't appreciate the fact that LHARC is
     "portable". If they're not programmers, portability means
     about as much to them as the cost of green cheese.
       They don't appreciate the fact that no consultations were
     made. Three people running DOS systems? Give me a break! Does
     that constitute an acceptable amount of opinions on the
     matter? No one could possibly say yes to that.

       What rationale did you use, Vince? That ARC 7.0 is now
     commercial software? As far as I can tell, ARC 5.12 is public
     domain. People I know have been passing it around for years,
     without mention of cost. So why drop a perfectly good standard,
     which has already been ported over successfully to almost
     every environment in sight? I'll say it now:

         " Using the present commerical status of ARC 7.0
           appears to me to be the least logical rationale
           possible to eliminate the use of ARC 5.12. "

       We've already got a standard! Why change it? It works! It
     works real good. It's been ported. So what if further versions
     are commercial?

       Vince, you've allowed personal sentiment to come ahead of
     your responsibilities. Being the Editor of FidoNews does allow
     a good amount of personal sentiment and ideology to come into
     the job. It's essential to being a good editor. But you've
     got to make sure that the network comes out ahead in the end.

       It is clear to me that you have failed to do so. If you wish
     to stand permanently beside your views, I would reccomend that
     you resign. But I hope that rather than that, you will listen
     to reason (and a host of other sysops) and re-institute ARC
     5.12 as the standard compression method for FidoNews.

     I am pleased to say that as of 9/21/90, the OTHERNET nodelist is
     available (OTHERNET.264).

     The OtherNet NodeList is a nodelist of selected networks other
     than Fidonet (Zones 1-5).  It is a compilation of individual
     nodelist segments contributed by the drafters and compilers of
     those segments.  Contribution of these segments to this
     compilation does not diminish the rights of the contributors.

     This nodelist has been compiled by myself for my personal use,
     due to Parselist's limitation that 6 nodelists be compiled.
     Due to public interest, this nodelist is being made available
     via the FREQ magic name of OTHERNET.

     YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RESULTS OF USING THIS NODELIST.  BY
     COMPILING THIS NODELIST YOU AGREE THAT I CANNOT BE HELD LIABLE
     FOR IT'S USE BY YOURSELF.  I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES
     OR COSTS THAT RESULT FROM THE USE OF THIS NODELIST, INCLUDING THE
     DIALING OF A WRONG NUMBER DUE TO OVERLAPPING ZONE/NET/NODE
     ADDRESS USAGE!!!

     The contents of the OtherNet.264 nodelist are as follows:

     I don't compile the MACLIST (Zone 6), SIGNODES (Zones 24-29,34),
     and ENETLIST (Zone 50) nodelists into the OTHERNET nodelist; I
     compile those three along with the NODELIST (Zones 1-5), the
     OTHERNET nodelist (this file) and a PRIVATE nodelist, to max
     out at the six nodelists Parselst allows.

     I update the OtherNet nodelist as often as I can, please don't
     flamemail me if it's outta date.  Remember, this is something I
     do for my own personal use, I'm simply sharing it with others.

     I wish to thank everyone who has contributed to this effort by
     providing information and nodelists for OtherNets.

     Have you ever wondered about "OtherNets"?  You know, all those
     other networks out there besides Fidonet (yeah, yeah, there are
     OtherNets!).  What are their names?  Who runs them?  What is
     their purpose?  What can they offer?

     Many of us have heard of some "well-known" OtherNets, like
     Alternet, RBBS-NET, SigNet and EggNet.  But did you know that
     there is MACLIST, for Macintosh sysops?  How about EchoNet, a
     network dedicated to quality echos?  Or The Network?  Have you
     heard of SpectroNet?  Paranet?  Candynet?  LCRNet?  Emergency
     Net?  There's more ....

     It's questions like this in my mind that led me to begin doing
     some research into the OtherNets.  Two other articles in this
     issue of Fidonews ("Announcing the OtherNet Nodelist" and "A
     Listing of Known OtherNets") represent the results of that
     research.

     Apparently, judging from the number of file-requests in my
     fd.log, there is a lot of interest out there in OtherNets.
     That's why I've decided to establish a new echo, area tag name
     OTHERNETS, for the disemmination and sharing of information
     on OtherNets.

     OTHERNETS will originate from my Fidonet system, 1:269/111.  It
     is my hope that there will be sufficient interest to place it on
     the distribution systems for Fidonet, RBBS-NET, SigNet and any
     of the OtherNet "backbone" distribution systems.

     For more information on OtherNets, or to obtain a link to the
     OTHERNETS echo, please contact me at one of the addresses below:

         Distribution Sites for the Programmers Distribution Network
         -----------------------------------------------------------

            A couple of months ago, I started a Distribution Network
     for Programmers.  I had no idea that this would take off into
     what it has today.  I get requests three or four times a week
     asking to locate a link for a node into the PDN.  This has become
     a task in itself!  I figured that the best way for me to reach
     the maximum amount of people would be to publish another article
     here and list a FEW of the current PDN sites.  There are more,
     but I thought "They will get the point!".  If you are interested
     in picking up the PDN for your Net, or for yourself, please
     contact one of the below listed nodes.  They will be more then
     happy to help out.  Probably, the best way for you to get a good
     link, (If you are in Zone 1) is to contact one of the Regional
     Coordinators listed first.  For other zones, choose a node listed
     for your Zone, and they should be able to direct you to the
     CHEAPEST link.  I have tried to set things up so that it is
     inexpensive as possible to move these files around.  If you are
     an in-state, long distance node to one of these coordinators,
     then go to another region.  Keeps your costs down!  If you have
     any general questions about the PDN, feel free to send me a
     NetMail message and ask away!  I will be more then happy in
     aiding you to set up.  I am truely sorry if the below information
     is incorrect, and I have mis-guided you, but these things change
     so fast (Baud rates, etc) that I cannot keep up with all of them!
     If you are carrying the PDN, and you are not listed below, I am
     sorry.  I listed only those that are 9600 baud and above.  This
     does not mean that you cannot carry the PDN, I am sure that
     people will be more then happy to support you at 1200/2400 baud.

     Happy Hacking!

     Popcorn packing?
     The popcorn padding: an ecological packaging can replace
     plastic.

     Alexander Fruit & Trading Co of Geyserville Calif has come
     up with an environmentaly correct packaging idea -
     substituting popped popcorn for plastic foam.

     Steve Sommer, president of the 5-year-old gourmet wine and
     food company 75 miles north of San Francisco, began to pack
     everything from ginger honey sauce to cabernet sauvignon in
     popcorn after his five kids lobbied for more ecologically
     sound packaging material.

     Unlike plastic foam, popcorn "is naturally biodegradable, so
     you may feed it to birds or use it as mulch in your garden,"
     Sommer said.  He does not advise that customers eat the
     packaging.

     "We want to avoid any liability problems," he said. "Besides
     its usually stale by the time it arrives in the mail."

     Sommer hopes his sales of popcorn for packaging purposes may
     soon rival his $500,000-a-year food and wine business.

     Prospective customers are excited by the idea of snubbing
     plastic foam, but they want to make sure popcorn contains
     all the right cushioning properties.

     Janet Churchill, in charge of packaging for Montessori
     Services in nearby Santa Rosa, said she wonders how much the
     popcorn breaks down in transit.  "We've just started using
     it and we haven't had any complaints from customers yet."
     she said.

     Joan Graham, who with her husband Gary, owns a Sonoma crafts
     gallery called Good Day Sunshine, said she started looking
     for a plastic foam substitute a couple of years ago when
     customers noted that using the ecologically unsound plastic
     kernels reflected badly on her store.

     She is now awaiting her shipment of popcorn from Sommer.

     "I think using this will make me feel a whole lot less
     guilty about how I send my goods," she said.

     John Clark, a buyer in charge of packaging materials for
     Santa Rosa Paper, which currently distributes plastic foam
     packaging, said his company also is interested in switching
     to popcorn.

     However, he is awaiting a ruling from United Parcel Service
     for approval of popcorn's use in shipping all goods.

     "I know Sommer's company has recieved UPS approval to ship
     his goods, and others may independently have received such
     approvals, but they haven't issued a general ruling to cover
     all shipped goods yet," he said.

     "If they do, popcorn may become the packaging material of
     choice," he added, putting a major dent in the multimillion
     dollar plastic foam packaging market.
