                         The Legend of Sleepy Zone 6
                                  Doug Myers

     Fidonews normally attempts to present you with tracible facts and
     attributed opinion.  Actual information and informed opinion about
     Zone 6 is in short supply, however, so this editorial is based on
     the gossip floating around.  Anyone reading this newsletter who is
     better informed is welcome to comment.

     In the Sleepy Hollow of Fidonet, reports abound of a headless
     horseman rumbling through Zone 6.  Rumor has it that the Zone 6
     nodelist segment is outdated and that the Zone 6 Coordinator isn't
     communicating with the other five zones of Fidonet.  Though the Z6C
     is reported to exchange echoes and occasional mail with Bob
     Seaborn's system, little has been heard of him elsewhere.  Most
     recently, his lack of presence was fealt in the proposed
     International Coordinator election, where he offered no comment
     whatsoever.

     Now the rumor hits Fidonews that there is a second Zone 6 nodelist
     segment being included in the Zone 2 World Nodelist and distributed
     to the other ZC's.  The alternate zone segment covers 6 of the 7
     regions in Zone 6, and is being compiled - not by the Z6C - but by a
     Russian Sysop in Viet Nam.

     Is it that nodelist information can't be gathered in the jungles of
     Hong Kong, and so this task must be relegated to the booming
     supermetropolis of Viet Nam?  Or is it time for the Regional
     Coordinators of Zone 6 to decapitate their resident headless
     horseman?

                          Region 13 Policy Proposal

     Region 13 has a new Regional policy proposed for vote.  This is the
     first update proposed since 1994.

     Sysops in region should contact their NC for information.  A copy
     has been delivered to all NC's in R13 (some routed, most crashed).

     Discussion is expected to be in the R13SYSOP echo.

     Specifics on the election can be obtained from 1:13/2.

     [Editor's Note - Appended to Carol's announcement above is the
     policy proposal below distributed to the Network Coordinators in
     Region 13]:


     Region 13 Election Policy Proposal
     Proposed Revision 2.03
     January 30, 2000

     Heavily modified by David Calafrancesco
     superseding Rev 1.04, August 21, 1994

     Written in committee by Michael Walsh, R13C, with the assistance and
     input of Phillip Dampier, Howie Ducat and Bill Fisch

     Changes suggested by various members of the region and incorporated

     This proposal is presented to the membership of Region 13 for debate
     and modification as is deemed appropriate, and wil be balloted upon
     in its final form.  If adopted, it will become the first part of a
     region-wide operations policy.

     A simple majority of the ballots received will be necessary to adopt
     this proposal.

       --Michael Walsh, R13C

     ===================================================================

     I. The Election Moderator (EM)

         A. The moderator is appointed by the RC at the beginning of the
     RC's term, and must be confirmed by a vote of the nodes of the
     region.  Any node can volunteer to be the election moderator.  The
     RC will select a candidate from the volunteers.  Discussion on the
     FIDONEWS 17-30               Page 3                   24 Jul 2000


     selection will take place for as long as necessary in the R13
     Sysop's echo with the RC able to call for a confirmation vote after
     one week of discussion.  A netmail ballot to confirm or reject the
     selection is then held, using the procedure outlined later in this
     document. The RC will count the votes and post the results in the
     R13 sysops echo, and if a simple majority {trunc(ballots/2)+1} vote
     is in favor of the selectee, this person is confirmed.

         B. The election moderator has complete control over the
     electoral process and validates all candidates' nominations, counts
     all votes and announces the results.  The election moderator may
     appoint an assistant with the approval of all nominated candidates
     at the end of the nomination process, whose job will be to assist in
     counting votes.  It is highly recomended that the EM use a robot
     vote counter to automate the tally process and post interim results
     of whose ballots have been received and validated, but not which
     candidate is currently leading.

         C. In order to easily identify the election moderator to members
     of the region, s/he will receive the nodelist designation of 1:13/2,
     and will be added to the segment upon confirmation. (I. A.)

         D. The election moderator serves in the appointed position for
     the entire term of the sitting RC, but may be replaced by the RC
     using this same process.

     II. Election Details

         A. The Election Moderator (EM) has sole discretion to select the
     working echo for the election.  It is suggested that declerations be
     accepted in any of the three major R13 echos but the EM may restrict
     to a single echo which meets the needs of the election (accessable
     to all R13 nodes) as necessary. The Primary R13 echos will be
     defined as those listed in an available echolist database as being
     the R13 sysops echo, the R13 election echo and the R13 coordinators
     echo and being listed in such database by the current RC and/or REC.
     Any echo of a similar name listed by one or more other members of
     the region will be considered an unofficial echo and the EM may use
     it or ignore it at their sole discretion.  At the time of this
     writing those echo tags are currently R13SYSOP, R13_ELECTION and
     R13COORD.

         B. The final election schedule is set by the election moderator
     (EM) but should adhere to the following norms.  All schedules start
     at 00:01 hours and end at 24:00 hours.  Schedules can be stretched
     as necessary to ensure that all nodes in the region are dealt with
     fairly.  In the past schedules have been delayed to accomodate
     storms and other network problems.

           1. Announcement of the election: 7 days.

             a. The EM will cause sufficient notices to be made in all
     three of the above referenced R13 echos (sysop, election and
     coordinators) echos so that everyone in the region has the same
     opportunity to participate. The election moderator will also cause a
     netmail to be sent to each NC in the region as well as an article to
     FIDONEWS 17-30               Page 4                   24 Jul 2000


     be submitted to FIDONEWS. This only requires a best effort attempt
     to route to each NC and does not require the EM to crash mail direct
     to any NCs.  We also recognize that we can't control the editorial
     policies of FIDONEWS and only can require a submission, not
     publication.

             b. The announcement describes what position will be elected,
     whether RC or REC or other.

             c. The announcements are to be posted at least three times
     in a one-week period in the above echos.  Netmail notification is
     done at least once, as is the FidoNews announcement though the EM
     can always undertake more if they so choose.

            2. Declarations of Candidacy: 2 weeks.

             a. Any member of the region may declare their own candidacy.

             b. Any member of the region may nominate any other member.

             c. A nominee will only become a candidate if they notify the
     EM of their acceptance of the nomination within the time alloted for
     declarations.

             d. Declarations should be allowed in any of the above R13
     echos as well as netmail or email sent to the EM.  At the EMs
     discression they may select one R13 echo as the primary election
     business echo and the EM may restrict declarations and nominations
     to that single echo.

             e. The message header/timestamp will be used to determine
     whether a declaration was received in time, but no more than two
     days after the end of the declaration period.

           3. Questions to the Candidates: 3 weeks

             a. The candidates will state, briefly, their platforms in
     the designated election business echomail area.

             b. Members of the region may question the candidates on any
     issues that they may feel are important to them or the region.

             c. Debate between candidates should be limited; it is the
     membership that must be answered, and the election moderator may
     halt debate at any time if it is clear that the membership is not
     benefiting from the debate.  This does not apply to clarification of
     position; i.e., if a candidate states a position and it isn't clear,
     any other candidate may request clarification and present their
     position.  This is not intended to prevent opposing points of view
     from being discussed, but rather is intended to prevent the
     candidates from focusing on each other and ignoring the members of
     the region.

          4. Vote: Two weeks are allowed for all members of the region to
          vote.

     FIDONEWS 17-30               Page 5                   24 Jul 2000


          5. Announcement of the results: within three days of the end of
          the vote.

          C. Elections are held once every two years for each of the RC
     and REC positions.  The elections are staggered, such that in one
     calendar year an RC election will be held, and the next calendar
     year an REC election will be held.  The purpose of this is to
     maintain continuity in the operation of the region.

     III. Recall Elections

         1. Recalls are started by a referendum, in which 20% of the
     nodes or 20% of the NCs of the region request the recall action;
     this request for a recall must be filed with the election moderator.

         2. The recall election is held as a regular election would be,
     with the sitting *C running as a candidate while still in office.

         3. A recall election does not upset the regular schedule of
     elections; if a recall election is held, and results in the
     replacement of a *C, that replacement will only serve until the next
     regularly scheduled election at which time s/he may run as a
     candidate.

     IV. Voting Procedure

         A. Each nodelisted operator is entitled to one vote; if more
      than one person shares responsibility for a system, and also share
      a nodelist entry, then only one vote is allowed between them. By
      the same definition, a system with more than one node address is
      still a single system and is only entitled to a single vote.

         B. Ballots are counted only when received by the election
      moderator.  The EM may accept nodes sent by netmail (direct or
      routed), email or even public posting in the election business
      echo.  The EM may restrict the method of receiving ballots to only
      netmail at their discretion.  Voice or proxy ballots are NOT
      COUNTED.  All ballots must be addressed in such a way that they
      will be received by the EM and identify the note as a ballot (eg
      being addressed to 1:13/2).

         C. Ballots should probably be sent DIRECT to avoid the
      possibility of tampering, but in recognition of the fact that not
      all members of the region are able/willing to make a long-distance
      call to deliver their vote and that the EM might not have a POTS
      line to receive crashed mail, it may be routed. As always, ballots
      which are routed are not guaranteed to be delivered, and as such,
      no responsibility can be placed on any systems who may route such
      mail.

         D. Each ballot must contain:

            1. The name and node address of the operator casting the
            ballot,

            2. The ballot identifying who the sysop is voting for.
     FIDONEWS 17-30               Page 6                   24 Jul 2000


            3. A password to be used in announcing and validating the
            vote.

            4. Example ballot:

                John Doe, sysop of 1:2634/567
                candidate_name
                {ballot_password}

          E. The election moderator will tally and summarize the ballots,
     listing each vote by password in the announcement, i.e. if John Doe
     and Jane Doe are candidates, the announcement of the results would
     look like this:

                      John Doe                Jane Doe
                      --------------------    --------------------
                      Beeswax                 Whatchamacallit
                      Zaphod                  Zoos
                      Viper                   Kitchen
                                              Wrangler
                                              Hunter
                      --------------------    --------------------
                      3 votes (37.5%)         5 votes (62.5%)

          A second announcement will follow this, listing in numerical
     order, all node addresses from which a ballot was received and
     counted.  These two messages will serve as the record of vote, and
     by the nature of their content, will allow all members of the region
     to see that their ballots were counted and counted correctly while
     maintaining the confidentiality of the votes.  Under no
     circumstances will the Election Moderator (or assistant) release any
     information concerning the nature of specific ballots -- absolute
     confidentiality of the ballots must and will be maintained.

        F. A candidate must receive a simple majority of the votes in
     order to be elected. If there is a clear understanding of the
     leading candidates (combined 75% of ballots) then a runoff between
     the top two candidates can commence, otherwise supplementary runoffs
     to determine the top two candidates may be necessary.

             For example:

             If four candidates are running, and the vote is:

             A: 91 votes    B: 37 votes    C: 69 votes    D: 12 votes

             Candidates "A" and "C" will face each other in a runoff to
             determine the winner of the election.  A runoff election is
             held between the two candidates receiving the most votes,
             and is handled as described above except:

             1. One week for further questions to the remaining
     candidates, not three, and;

             2. All results from the general election are discarded and a
     new ballot is taken, with the results of the new ballot alone being
     FIDONEWS 17-30               Page 7                   24 Jul 2000


     counted.

             3. One week for voting instead of two as above.

             Second example:

             Same four candidates above but the breakdown is

             A: 35 votes     B: 35 votes    C: 35 votes    D: 15 votes

         An intermediate runoff between the top three candidates will
         commence. In general, the runoff will be amongst the candidates
         that recived 75% of the vote.

         G. In any case, if the election results in a tie, the ZC or RC
     will choose the RC or REC from amongst the two tied candidates.

         H. The elected person will take office one week following the
     announcement of the results, and in the case of the RC election,
     with the approval of the ZC (in recognition of FidoNet Policy.)  The
     outgoing coordinator will make available all materials necessary to
     ensure a smooth transition, and will support the coordinator-elect
     for as long as is possible or needed.

     V. Dispute Resolution

         A. Any dispute of the election results, whether a miscounted
     ballot or a ballot not counted that a node claims should have been
     etc... must be filed, via netmail, to the election moderator within
     the one week time frame before the electee takes office.  This
     dispute notice should be carbon-copied to at least two other members
     of the region (RC and REC for example) to ensure fairness and action
     on the part of the election moderator.

       B. The election moderator will announce the dispute, and request a
     Judge of Elections be named.  The Judge of Elections will be the ZC,
     or if s/he is unavailable, another region's RC or a member of the
     region acceptable to all of the candidates.

       C. The Judge of Elections will receive from the election moderator
     all votes cast, without the summaries.

       D. The Judge of Elections will recount the votes and create a new
     summary which will be forwarded to the election moderator and posted
     accordingly. This will be the final count in cases of dispute.

     VI. Amendments to Election Policy

        A. Any member of the region may propose an amendment to this
     election policy, but no amendment may be proposed during an
     election.

        B. Such a proposal must be sent to the RC and the election
     moderator. The RC will cause it to be distributed to all NCs in the
     region, and direct that the NCs distribute it to all members of the
     region.

        C. Debate on any amendment may be held in any of the above listed
        echos.

        D. The process for voting on the amendment will be as follows:

           1. The proposal will require a simple majority of the votes to
     be adopted.

           2. The ballots will be counted as in a regular election, with
     the results posted similarly.

           3. The time frame for debate is open, but the voting period
     will still take place in one week's time.

           4. The election moderator will schedule the vote at least one
     week in advance to allow all members of the region to have time to
     consider their vote.

           5. The vote can be forced to occur by referrendum of either
     20% of the nodes or 20% of the NCs; if 20% of the nodes or NCs
     request the vote be scheduled, the election moderator has no choice
     but to schedule the vote.

     VII. Continutity and Successive Administrations

          It is recommended to the members of the region that any
     candidates who may run for the RC position be clearly asked to abide
     the terms and conditions of the approved regional policy, such that
     no future RC may throw out policy to suit his/her whim.  If a
     candidate does not clearly state that they will abide the terms and
     conditions of approved regional policy, you are advised that you
     should cast your vote in favor of a candidate who will abide it so
     that it can be maintained in perpetuity for the benefit of the
     members of the region.

                       FN_SYSOP Election Preliminaries

     The international echo for Fidonet Sysops elects a moderator each
     year.  Although this election isn't scheduled until October, the
     preliminaries are underway.  Douglas Myers, the current moderator
     (also serving as editor of this publication) has asked echo
     participants to comment on his proposed selection of Carol
     Shenkenberger to coordinate the election again this year.  Douglas
     noted that Election Coordinator selection should be made by early
     August to allow sufficient time for organizing the election.
     Douglas further announced that he will not be seeking a third term
     as FN_SYSOP moderator, though he plans to remain an active
     participant in the echo.

     also receive routed notice of this feature.  In my case, it

     Also, as information is provided to me, I will be adding a

     time between when the message is received, and when it is
     sent on to other nodes, or available to be sent onward,
     defined in minutes. A latency of ! implies that there is an
     immediate response, and an attempt to deliver immediately
     after processing, or a "MinuteMail System", as it were.
