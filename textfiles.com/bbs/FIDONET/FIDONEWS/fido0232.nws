        this week.


                            Fido from the Inside

        A hi-fi,  mansion and stationwagon are critical at all 
        events Ben Baker desired a light-tube!  To watch a van as an 
        image or reflection in a sickening reflector inflamed Ben 
        Baker.  Why a light-tube?  A physicist might cry that a 
        light-tube is critical; furiously the physicist cries "the 
        light-tube is valuable by the same token Ben Baker 
        fantasizes of apartments and automobiles.  " Spooky.  
        Fascinating.  This is peculiar.  The physicist croons of a 
        light-tube during the time that Ben Baker dreams of 
        stationwagons.  Would Marcella ponder about the loves of Ben 
        Baker?  Marcella thinks that the physicist is crazy.  A 
        light-tube?  Why? Marcella yodeled " Physicist,  you're 
        maniacal and so is Ben Baker.  A light-tube indeed! " Ben 
        Baker now was arrogant.  The physicist indubitably was

        aloof.  But Marcella hummed to them " Do you follow me? " 
        Take it easy.  Marcella commenced to speak of dogs and 
        hawks,  even babies or a brother.  Spooky!  A poetic 
        novelist is still not a Goethe.  AAAchoo!  

        Either Karl Schinke plays the violin or I would like to 
        write an editorial.  Abraham Lincoln said that if I am 
        catching cold,  then Al Capone is crooked.  AAAchoo!  

        To think is wonderful,  don't you think?  Probably I do 
        think FidoNet will last very long because subroutines are 
        like that,  don't you think?.  For another reason, clever 
        things occur.  

        Jane Fonda said that if I do think FidoNet will last very 
        long,  then Lizzie Borden is dirty.  Cough.  Concerning that 
        issue: As Samuel Butler might have said, goodness is like 
        the sword; those who appeal to it shall perish by it. Ah 
        yes. Jane Fonda thought this was terrific: A paragon 
        physicist spoke "Arrange for a strange tale,  Thom."  Thom,  
        this is an agreement!  

        To think is clever,  don't you think? I don't know what I do 
        think of the public domain Fido project.  

        John MacEnroe might have thought that I certainly hang in 
        there, but not Mohammed Ali.  Hmm. Sporting duelists and 
        unsporting players should get along.  

        Anyway,  let's imagine that I do think there should be a 
        national directory of Fidonet users.  Why?  If there isn't a 
        reason then Larry Flint is more wonderful than Helen 
        Caldicott.  Anthony Comstock said that if I do think there 
        should be a national directory of Fidonet users,  then Larry 
        Flint is filthy.  Cough.  Ah.  Ah.  Yes.  Yes.  I do think 
        about such things. Would you rather be a scholar or an 
        ignoramous?  Do you really imagine I am intelligent?  

        Just be content that we should.  Why?  Only an ignoramous 
        could imagine that I tell you why.  Ah. A lazy scholar often 
        falls prey to a honest ignoramous.  AAAchoo!  Concerning 
        that issue: Oh, never mind. Perhaps I really am an 
        ignoramous.  But Valery said that a man is infinitely more 
        complicated than his intelligence.  Wouldn't you say the 
        same of a computer? Ah yes. Next question.  

        Sober lunatics and zany citizens should get along.  AAAchoo!  
        For me, wanting is needing.  Conceivably I do want to write 
        an editorial because my subroutines are down.  Also, because 
        my ROMS told me so.  It's about time for a story, isn't it?  

        Draining champagne is Tom Jennings's infatuation.  Bolting 
        meat is Tom Jennings's desire.  Nevertheless Mr.Toad 
        suddenly glimpses only cucumbers.  El bizarro!  Tom Jennings 
        yodels to Mr.Toad about champagne and meat at all events 
        Mr.Toad will glimpse tomatoes.  El bizarro.  Mr.Toad rambled 
        to Tom Jennings's yellow mansion and commenced to revile and

        madden Tom Jennings while Tom Jennings was whispering about 
        meat.  Hold on.  Since Mr.Toad's own black mansion was 
        frightening;  he spoke aprehensively to Tom Jennings " Do 
        you follow me? " This slaughtered Tom Jennings.  But a 
        cosmologist began to bolt some spinach.  Mr.Toad was 
        infuriated.  Instantly he knew that to see a tomato is not 
        to observe it. Tom Jennings understands that champagne and 
        meat are not tomatoes.  The cosmologist does not. Are you 
        interested?  Mr.Toad is infuriated and exhausted,  by the 
        same token some spinach would serve him to be nurturing 
        while Tom Jennings slaughtered the cosmologist.  The 
        fictional have unbelieving ways. Sniff...

        ============================================================ 

        Hello Everyone!  My name is Darlene Faccone and I'm Sysop of 
        one of the new Fidos in Southern California.  I've been having 
        trouble thinking of a name for my node so..........I'M 
        HAVING A CONTEST!!

        The temporary name I'm using is NAME_MY_NODE.  I will be 
        accepting name suggestions until 9/30/85 when a real name 
        will be chosen.  The author of the selected name will win a 
        SURPRISE so, please include a mailing address with your 
        suggestion.  I've decided to let all of you help select the 
        winning entry.  Watch FidoNews for the list of suggested 
        names on which to vote... 

        My BBS doesn't have a single theme yet but I'm leaning 
        toward an informational type system where people can ask 
        questions relating to the IBM PC family and peripherals.  My 
        system is running on an IBM PC/AT with 512K RAM, 20mB disk 
        drive, color display and Hayes 1200B Smartmodem.  

        I am a reformed mainframer with 19 years applications and 
        systems programming experience.  My skills are mostly 
        software related but I'm always extremely interested in 
        learning new things all the time.  

        I'll be upgrading memory soon to a megabyte so that I can 
        run Multi-link or some other comparable multitasking soft-
        ware which will allow me to keep Fido on-line all the time 
        but still use the system for other things. 

        I'm VERY excited about being a part of Fido.  Everyone has 
        been extremely helpful and supportive.  

        DON'T FORGET TO SEND ME A NAME SUGGESTION!!!!  I'LL BE 
        WATCHING FOR SOME REALLY CLEVER WITTY NAMES.

                             LA50 Print Utility


        LA50PRT is not really a fido utility, however it was written 
        because of fido.  When the new fido documentation came out, 
        it was over 300K of text.  All throughout the text was 
        overstriking, and the LA50 cannot handle this well.  In 
        order for me to print a copy of the fido manual, I had to 
        write a utility to optimize the printing for the LA50.   
        This utility reads an entire line at a time and does the 
        overstrikes at the end.  Rather than overstriking each 
        character within a line, the object would be to print the 
        entire line once, then overstrike the necessary characters.  
        This eliminates all but the necessary backspaces the printer 
        has to make, and speeds the printing process.  I hope other 
        DEC Rainbow users will find this program as useful as I did.  

        The program may be downloaded from fido 107/17 
        at (609) 429-6630.

                     BUY AMERICAN.....SCREW  N.E.C. !!!

        I was absolutely DISGUSTED at reading Bob Hartman's article 
        in the Sept 2 issue of Fido News.  Before yanking out your 
        American made Intel chips and replacing them with pirated 
        hardware (stolen by the Japaneese) I wish you would read 
        this and give it some thought!!  

        All of us concerned Sysops tell our users not to pirate 
        software or place it on our boards.  Why?  Stealing just 
        isn't accepted in our society.  Yet, people are telling 
        computer users to put stolen hardware in their machines and 
        giving it no thought.  NEC literally stole the process for 
        making the Intel  8088  & 8087 chips and the matter IS going  
        to  court.  I'm sure Intel will win the case (their 
        signature is ACTUALLY on the NEC chip, because NEC didn't 
        even re-work the design!) 

         My husband works for Intel and Intel has been laying people 
        off because of the undercutting going on with NEC, Hitachi, 
        & Mitzubishi (sp).  This is precisely why computer prices 
        are dropping.  These unscrupulous Japaneese firms have 
        publicly announced their intentions to ruin the American 
        integrated circuit  market  by  selling parts  far  below  
        manufacturing costs. While low prices might seem nice to end 
        users....the entire computer shake-up and bankruptcy of 
        American firms can be blamed directly on these unfair trade 
        practices of the above named Japaneese firms.  

        It is no different to support pirated software or pirated 
        hardware....the  principal  is  the  same.    I  think  
        every computer user should know the facts before supporting 
        such unethical and undesirable companies.  I would rather 
        throw my computer out the window than replace an honest 
        American chip with a stolen, pirated circuit made by any of 
        these firms.  

         Just remember, if YOU put an NEC chip in your 
        computer...YOU are  putting  American  workers  out  of  
        jobs  and  YOU  are supporting unethical trade practices.  
        Let that be on YOUR conscience   not  mine!!   I will wait 
        for Intel to win  it's case,  and  for  Intel's  new faster 
        chips  and  not  support computer  criminals.   I  hope all 
        of you  will  think  about this!!  

                   Very Sincerely,

                                  SanyoNet
                        Help for the lost Sanyo user.

        SanyoNet is a group of FIDO BBS systems who have grouped 
        together for the sole purpose of disseminating information, 
        files, and news, as well as helping users of Sanyo computer 
        systems. Most of the people involved in the system are 
        running fido on MBC-555 systems, although there are systems 
        running on other machines that support sanyo interest 
        groups. Sanyo Business Systems will soon be involved in the 
        network.  

        As of Sept 6, we have 14 systems involved with SanyoNet. It 
        has grown rapidly (Nearly as rapidly as FIDONET!) "Sanyfido" 
        list are distributed weekly, or whenever new systems are 
        added to the list. This list is "FidoNetted" to all SanyoNet 
        nodes and all other interested parties. A small, and I do 
        mean small, newsletter is distributed with each listing.  

        Many other projects are in the works. One sysop will soon 
        compile a complete listing of all sanyo oriented files from 
        all member BBS's.  This list will be distributed to ALL 
        known sanyo BBS's, be they Fido or otherwise. Armed with 
        this list, a sanyo user can find the nearest node where he 
        can obtain the needed files.  

        Another project involves a rewrite of the sanyo MSDOS 2.11 
        bios.  The projects goal is to provide more IBM 
        compatability than is currently available with the present 
        bios.  

        Most, if not all questions dealing with hardware troubles, 
        compatability questions, software/hardware operation, ect.  
        can usually be answered by someone on the net. If not we 
        usually know someone who can!  

        One request before I close:  We desperatly need ANYONE who 
        knows of a sanyo BBS system other than those listed here to 
        leave a fidomail message addressed to: sysop node 14/386, 
        with the systems name, location, number, hours of operation, 
        sysops name, and maximum Baud rate supported. We need not 
        only sanyo based BBS's but all BBS's that have an active 
        sanyo sig online.  

        thanks...until next time...happy fidoing

        The Adventures of Luke Vaxhacker               Episode n-1.0

            As we enter the scene, an Imperial Multiplexer is trying 
        to kill a consulate ship.  Many of their signals have gotten 
        thru,  and RS232 decides it's time to fork off a new process 
        before  this old ship is destroyed.  His companion,  3CPU is 
        following him only because he appears to know  where  he  is 
        going...  

            "I'm  going to regret this!" cried 3CPU,  as he followed 
        RS232 into the buffer.  RS232 closed the pipes, made the sys 
        call,  and their process detached itself  from  the  burning 
        shell of the ship.  

            The  commander  of  the  Imperial  Multiplexer was quite 
        pleased with the attack.  "Another process just forked, Sir.  
        Instructions?"  asked  the lieutenant "Hold your fire.  That 
        last power failure must have caused a trap thru  zero.  It's 
        not using any cpu time, so don't waste a signal on it." 

            "We  can't  seem  to  find the data file anywhere,  Lord 
        Vadic." "What about that forked process?  It could have been 
        holding the channel open,  and just pausing.  If  any  links 
        exist, I want them removed or made inaccessible.  Ncheck the 
        entire  file system 'til it's found,  and nice it -20 if you 
        have to." 

            Meanwhile, in our wandering process... "Are you sure you 
        can ptrace this thing without causing a core dump?"  queried 
        3CPU  to  RS232.  "This  thing's been stripped and I'm in no 
        mood to  try  and  debug  it."  The  lone  process  finished 
        execution,  only to find our friends dumped on a lonely file 
        system,  with the setuid inode stored safely in  RS232.  Not 
        knowing  what  else  to  do,  they wandered around until the 
        Jawas grabbed them.  

            Enter our hero, Luke Vaxhacker,  who was out to get some

        replacement  parts  for his uncle.  The Jawas wanted to sell 
        him 3CPU,  but 3CPU didn't know how to talk directly  to  an 
        11/40 with RSTS, so Luke still needed some sort of interface 
        for 3CPU to connect to.  "How about this little RS232 unit?" 
        asked 3CPU.  "I've dealt with him many time before,  and  he 
        does  an  excellent  job at keeping his bits straight." Luke 
        was pressed for time, so he took 3CPU's advice and the three 
        left before they could get swapped out.  

            However,  RS232 was not the type to stay  put  once  you 
        remove  the retaining screws.  He promptly scurried off into 
        the deserted disk space.  "Great!" cried Luke, "Now I've got 
        this  little  tin  box  with  the only link to that file off 
        floating in the free disk space.  Well,  3CPU,  we better go 
        find  him before he gets allocated by someone else." The two 
        set off,  and finally traced RS232  to  the  home  of  PDP-1 
        Kenobe, who was busily trying to run an icheck on the little 
        RS  unit.  "Is this thing yours?  His indirect addresses are 
        all goofed up,  and the size is  gargantious.  Leave  things 
        like  this on the loose,  and you'll wind up with file dumps 
        everywhere.  However,  I think I've got  him  fixed  up.  It 
        seems  that he has a link to a data file on the Are-Em Star.  
        This could help the rebel cause." "I don't care about that," 
        said  Luke.   "I'm  just  trying  to  optimize  my   uncle's 
        scheduler." 

            Oh,  forget  about that.  Dec Vadic,  who is responsible 
        for your father's death,  has probably already destroyed his 
        farm  in  search of this little RS232.  It's time for you to 
        leave this place,  join the rebel cause,  and become a  UNIX 
        wizard!  I know a guy by the name of Con Solo, who'll fly us 
        to the rebel base at a price..." 

        ------------------------------------------------------------

            Luke  had grown up on an out of the way terminal cluster 
        whose natives spoke only BASIC,  but even he could recognize 
        an old ASR-33.  

            "It needs an EIA conversion at least," sniffed 3CPU, who 
        was  (as  usual) trying to do several things at once.  Light 
        flashed in Con  Solo's  eyes  as  he  whirled  to  face  the 
        parallel processor.  

            "I've  added a few jumpers.  The Milliamp Falcon can run 
        current loops around any Imperial TTY  fighter.  She's  fast 
        enough for you." 

            "Who's your co-pilot?" asked PDP-1 Kenobie.  

            "Two Bacco, here, my Bookie." 

            "Odds  aren't  good," said the brownish lump beside him, 
        and then fell silent, or over.  Luke couldn't tell which way 
        was up underneath all those leaves.  

            Suddenly,  RS232 started  spacing  wildly.  They  turned

        just  in  time  to  see a write cycle coming down the UNIBUS 
        toward them.  "Imperial  Bus  Signals!"  shouted  Con  Solo. 
        "Let's boot this popsicle stand! Tooie, set clock fast!" 

            "Ok,  Con,"  said  Luke,  "You  said this crate was fast 
        enough.  Get us out of here!" 

            "Shut up kid!  Two Bacco,  prepare to make the jump into 
        system space! I'll try to keep their buffers full." 

            As  the  bookie  began  to  compute the vectors into low 
        core,  spurious  characters  appeared  around  the  Milliamp 
        Falcon.   "They're  firing!"  shouted  Luke  "Can't  you  do 
        something?" 

            "Making the jump to system space takes  time,  kid.  One 
        missed  cycle and you could come down right in the middle of 
        a pack of stack frames!" 

            "Three to five we can go now," said the bookie.  

            Bright chunks of position independent  code  flashed  by 
        the cockpit as the Milliamp Falcon jumped through the kernal 
        page  tables.  As  the  crew breathed a sigh of relief,  the 
        bookie started paying off bets.  

            "Not  bad,   for  an  accoustically  coupled   network," 
        REMarked 3CPU. "Though there was a little phase jitter as we 
        changed parity."
