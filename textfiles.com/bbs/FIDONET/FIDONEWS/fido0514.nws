                           An Editor's Ramblings

          Well, things  didn't go  exactly as  planned. I had hoped to
     gather enough articles for an "April Fools" edition  of FidoNews.
     Unfortunately, there  just wasn't the time to make it happen this
     year. Maybe next year everything will work out.  In the meantime,
     if  you'd  like  to  start  writing an article for an April Fools
     edition (or any other holiday for that matter) feel free  to send
     it in  early. Just remember to leave me a message telling me when
     it should be published as I don't have the time to go  over every
     article. Most  weeks, I'm  lucky if I can find the time to browse
     the articles for major problems in content. I do find the time to
     respond to most of the mail I receive, so if you have an idea for
     an article drop me a line  and I'd  be happy  to discuss  it with
     you.

          As I write this, yet another long group of long time members
     of FidoNet are about to leave us. I wish them well and  hope they
     succeed  in  their  efforts.  While I can't sanction what they're
     doing, I can understand many of their reasons. One of the biggest
     problems in FidoNet is how much we seem to have lost. The days of
     mutual trust and respect seem to have vanished.  The case  of the
     twit sysop  in the policy documents seems to have been forgotten,
     or perhaps  it  just  needs  to  be  amended.  I  have  the great
     pleasure to be in a closely knit net (157). I have met and talked
     with many of the local FidoNet sysops (and a good  number of non-
     FidoNet  sysops)  and  I  believe  we  all  know  each other to a
     degree. I can always to find  something to  admire and/or respect
     in each  of these  fine individuals who dedicate at least part of
     themselves to the telecommunications community.

          Some of this is due to the face-to-face  meetings with these
     people. While our electronic medium has many advantages, there is
     nothing that can help establish  respect  for  these  peers  as a
     normal conversation. This makes "get togethers" like FidoCon very
     important. Over the next few months, you're going to see a lot of
     information on  the upcoming FidoCon in Cincinnati, and hope that
     many of you will find time  in  your  busy  schedules  (and tight
     budgets in  my case  at least)  for this  event. Sometimes when I
     read the messages that come across the net,  I can  almost follow
     the thoughts  and see the expressions on those who I have come to
     know. This only helps us to communicate better,  which is  one of
     the  things  we're  after...right?  I  also  hope that all if our
     FidoNet family will attend, even those who may  have left  us for
     one reason  or another.  Perhaps at  FidoCon we can even find the
     time to help heal the wounds that have caused the separations.

          I think all of us  would  agree  that  FidoNet  is spreading
     almost out  of control.  I firmly believe this is a good thing. I
     can not say that the results  we're seeing  are good  however. In
     this growth  we should  be striving to improve communications and
     understanding. Instead all I see  is  people  who  seem convinced
     FidoNews 5-14                Page 2                    4 Apr 1988


     that their  way is  the one  true way.  We should all try to be a
     little more understanding of  our fellow  sysops (and  users). We
     need to  learn how  to be  more tolerant  of each others views. A
     disagreement is not a reason to start a "blood feud." People like
     the  "Neuter-Net"  crowd  does  nothing for the net. Regional and
     network coordinators should be trying to remove people  like this
     from FidoNet. I know of no decent and upstanding sysop that would
     tolerate behavior like that  from his  users, and  likewise I can
     find no place for people like that in FidoNet.

          Being  a  FidoNet  sysop  carries  a responsibility and duty
     towards the net. I know those aren't exactly popular words today,
     but we  need to  remember them.  Each sysop is responsible to the
     net as a whole, and also has a  duty to  work with  it instead of
     against  it.  I'm  not  talking  about "political" topics here, I
     talking about COMMUNICATING and  RATIONALLY DISCUSSING  topics. I
     myself have  grown tired of the flaming and the personal attacks,
     for they have NO place in  FidoNet.  I  have  no  problem  with a
     friendly argument, just the almost violent fights that seem to be
     breaking out in many of the echomail conferences.

     Oh well.... This is getting me  depressed. I  really hate getting
     up  on  a  soapbox  and  preaching.  But  I  refuse to sit in the
     sidelines and watch FidoNet  get torn  apart by  what's going on.
     While  I  know  we  can  never  return to the wonderful spirit of
     cooperation that once existed, I firmly believe that we should be
     able to  discuss our  disagreements on a civil level. As I warned
     in one of my old columns, I shoulda  been a  preacher. Editorials
     like this  convince me I could have written one hell of a sermon.
     Hmmmm.... There's an  idea  in  there  somewhere,  maybe  it will
     mature in the following weeks. Until later...

     151/2
     Ben Mann

                  684 MEG On-Line

      After reading with great interest the last two issues
     of Fido News. And reading many articles on the new CD-ROM
     technology I decided that two 66 MEG HD's just weren't
     enough.

      After all our mainframe has 200 MEG per drive and my ALR
     '386 was way behind at 132 MEG HD. So I called Compact Disk
     Products, Inc., 217 East 85th. Street, New York, New York,
     10028, 1-121-996-6999. A nice sounding gentleman answered
     the phone and informed me they had both an Hitachi
     CDR-1503S and the PC-SIG CD disk in stock.

      I said sent it "AIR". The next day a nice new Hitachi
     CDR-1503S was mine.

      The hook up was stright foward despite the warning about
     use with different BBS systems. A nicely done INSTALL
     program comes with the PC-SIG CD-ROM disk and in just under
     1/2 hour I had the new toy installed.

      Re-boot and WOW. DIR the beast and there's over 111,000,000
     FREE. That's over 440 MEG of files on my new drive E:.

      I had to write a program to convert the .UPP files
     (list of files on each disk) to a TBBS readable format.
     Change a few menu's. And there I had it. The FULL PC-SIG
     library on-line.

      Now the mainframe people come back and say "552 MEG on
     T H A T ???". A short course on the DIR command. Many page
     fulls of files scroll by and away they go mumbling
     something about learning "C".

      If you would like to have a look, call Alert Data TBBS
     at 1-919-274-7000. It's in Greensboro, NC. It used to be
     five lines no waiting. Now days it's eight line, some
     waiting.

     By the way. You can daisy chain up to four per system.
     That's 2.2 GEGbyte. And if you have a hard time selling
     your better half on the idea, it plays audio CD's. Just
     tell them it's a computerized CD player. The sound is
     GREAT.

          Well this is the 3rd article I have written tonite and I
     hope it is the last. This is on the subject of "editing FidoNews"
     and is directed at BOTH sides of this debate.

          In this corner weighing in at XXX lbs we have FidoNews,
     publication of FidoNet, under the auspices of IFNA, by and for
     the FidoNet sysop, user, groupie. This prestigious publication,
     started by Tom Jennings, has grown from 2 pages a month to over
     30 pages some weeks. It has published the controversial, the
     sublime, the ridiculous, and even some material the national
     scandal mags would not touch with long poles. This publication
     has published (for lack of a better word) some articles that
     would light fires under a lot of us and on the other hand has
     been (sometimes) the ONLY source of information to the "grunt"
     sysops of the net. The management has decided to institute an
     editorial policy of not publishing obviously libelous or
     deceitful articles (a good point), and also offensive articles.
     This I must disagree with. While I may not "like" what Fnews
     publishes I can always "turn the page". This is akin to me saying
     that if I do not like the constitution, that it may not be
     printed because I "might" read it and be offended. If I read it
     and am offended, then I can only say it is my own fault for
     reading it. I am not forced to read FidoNews (nor any other
     publication for that matter) nor am I bound to believe what is
     written therein.

          In the other corner we have the management, weighing in at
     XXX lbs. These prestigious gentlemen say they are "looking out
     for us" by not publishing "offensive articles". Why? If I say in
     this article that the moon is a devil worship symbol, does that
     make it true? NO. If I say that BinkleyTerm is not a mailer
     program, does that make it true, NOT LIKELY (it is an excellent
     mailer by the way guys). But what it does do ( and it's only
     faault) is "offend" someone. Hey, tough luck folks, if it bothers
     ya, don't read it. I have always wondered how these book burners
     found "exact quotes" from offensive books. What did they do, sit
     and read it, yup every single word. Yet they chose AFTER the
     fact that they read it to try to stop me from even having the
     opportunity to judge for myself whether it offends ME by having
     the book, mag, article removed from print. If they can read it
     why can't I?

          To the management of FidoNews (whomever that may be) I say
     this.....publish EVERYTHING with only 2 exceptions and those
     being articles with OBVIOUS criminal intent of any kind and
     articles containing OBVIOUS LIES. Beyond that you should not
     concern yourself with offensive as the law does not cover
     offensive except in pornography mags aand even then they say that
     it is offensive only if sent to someone without them asking for
     it. We ask for FidoNews by the simple fact that we call and
     download it (ask your system to send it to us) which the courts
     say means the contents are not offensive to us.

     Jerry Hindle
     1:18/6 (aka 7:48/0)

          I have been reading this weeks Fnews (512) and have been
     giving connsiderable thought to the DAK controversy and IFNA's
     handling of that situation. I have come to the following
     conclusions on this matter:

         1)    While I do believe that IFNA tried to handle this
     matter to the best of their limited ability I find that thru no
     fault of their own they have been WHITEWASHED by DAK. I feel that
     DAK (as big a company as they are) was well aware that their
     "deal with one sysop" (not named by the way), was in no way,
     shape or form a true attempt to promote BBSing. They have lawyers
     there who fully know the meaning of the word COPYRIGHT. If they
     truely believed for even a split instant that permission from one
     sysop was in fact legal they are in for serious trouble down the
     road. Just suppose for an instant that I owned a copyright on
     Lotus 123 <tm> (which I DO NOT), and that someone gave them
     permission to use the opening screen in their ads. Lotus would sue
     the pants off DAK forr un-authorized use of copyrighted material
     not to mention TradeMark infringement. DAK knew full well they
     were violating a copyright when they did what they did. Their
     only interest in the pamplet was to sell products to go along
     with it (as evidenced by their claim of 50,000 moddems sold) and
     as an after thought they decided to "donate" any profits to the
     American Cancer Society (a very worthy cause I must say). They
     did this only to "cover their A$$" as it were since they could
     always claim no profits were made (although they failed to
     menntion how much the production costs of said pamplet were) and
     thus they were legit. They got caught and proceeded to whitewash
     IFNA with promises of this and promises of that. They said they
     will provide IFNA with free copies of the pamplet to distribute,
     but what they failed to mention is that the cost of production of
     those pamplets will be taken out of the future donations to the
     cancer society. They failed to mention that their cost of
     production was already covered in the profit margin of the sales
     associated with the pamplet give-away. They failed to mention
     these little items for one reason. They are in this for one
     reason and one reason ONLY, to make MONEY. They could give two
     hoots about BBSing, they care even less about IFNA or FidoNet.
     The pamplet in question was made for the purpose of generating
     sales in a slumping sector (ie computer add-ons) and beyond that
     they are not interested.

          Now the way I see it, this is what "should have happened".

           DAK distributes the pamplet with FidoNets blessings, BUT
     they absorb ALL costs of production and distribution AND they
     give a set fee per copy to the American Cancer Society (like 5
     cents each or something). This will benefit everyone in that DAK
     business write-off for their taxes, the American Cancer Society
     will get even more money and IFNA will get the free copies and
     the free publicity promised by DAK. For the "sin" of failing to
     get official permission before-hand DAK should be required to
     turn over to the American Cancer Society ALL funds received from
     FidoNews 5-14                Page 7                    4 Apr 1988


     the nominal charge they levied on the pamplet and do this in
     IFNA's name and not theirs. They eat the production costs on
     those too.

          Now I realize this may not seem like much to you but I must
     also make this point here. The article also states that should
     you NOT wish to have your node published in future copies of this
     pamplet that YOU ARE REQUIRED to send via SnailMail an official
     requesst to remove your node from the list. My question is this--
     ---WHY?????   I did not violate a copyright! I did not give DAK
     permission to use my name etc in any way shape or form and I
     certainly did not give IFNA permission to release ANY info on me
     to a corporaton to be used to "make a profit". The way I see it
     is that if they wanna use my name in their little scheme (which
     by the way they already have) then they owe ME the proceeds from
     that venture in the form of a "standard contract" from the Actors
     Guild. That contract I believe is now up to $200 + a DAY. Now
     that means that if they started this little venture even as late
     as a week ago from the date of this writing (3/24/88) that they
     owe me standard contract wages of $1400.00 and they owe the same
     to every sysop in FidoNet (less the one who gave them
     permission). I should not be required to "do" anything to stop
     them from using my name and node info. They should be required to
     obtain my "release in writing" which they have not done. I am
     awaiting their letter with amusement in that I will probably be
     long dead before it arrives. For thier info my mailing address
     is:

     Jerry Hindle
     P.O. Box 16223
     Memphis TN 38186-0223


     and my net/node number is at the top of this article. I am also
     awaiting the check for my past due "wages", wanna bet on whether
     I get that or not?

     DAK should have to EAT ALL PRODUCTION COSTS and donate all fees
     collected to the American Cancer Society. That is just one of the
     pitfalls off "doing business" when you do not get the proper
     perrmission IN ADVANCE!

                            A local EchoList for Users

              If you live in a area that contains a large number of
     boards running EchoMail, you may want to get together with other
     Sysops and produce a list of public Echos available in your
     calling area.  You will find that your Users appreciate such a
     list.
              A while back I received a number of messages from Users
     asking if I knew where they could read certain Echo conferences
     or if I could pick up Echos that I already carried but to which
     the User asking did not have access.  It was pretty much like the
     messages you read from Sysops asking where they can pick up an
     Echo.  But in this case, the Users just wanted to read them.
              Although the Echos on my BBS are, for the most part,
     ones that interest me personally, the entire idea of Echos is for
     the BBS's Users to be able to participate.  And since no BBS can
     carry _all_ the available Echos, Users must call from board to
     board, looking for Echos on topics of interest to them - often
     not finding them because many boards don't make the list of Echos
     available to first-time callers.  Sysops, of course, can locate a
     source of Echo feeds through various lists supplied by the Echo
     Hubs.  This got me to thinking about a User list of Echos in my
     area.
              After discussing the project with the NC, I posted the
     idea in our Net's Sysop Echo asking Sysops located in Pittsburgh
     or its suburbs to netmail me a list of their public Echos.  Most
     Sysops sent me their MSGAREA.BBS file and the original list took
     a little sorting out due to several boards having slightly
     different area descriptions for the same Echo.
              PGHECHO contains a one-screen description of what
     EchoMail is and how it works.  Some general instruction such as
     "stick to the topic of the Echo area" is included.  Then the list
     is divided into sections for General Interest, Health and Public
     Service, Communications, Sight and Sound, and Computer Hardware
     and Software.  The last category is the largest, listing Echos
     from Amiga to VAX.  Under each category the Echos are listed by
     EchoName, followed by a description (EchoNames themselves are
     often misleading) and then under each Echo, a list of Pittsburgh
     area boards which carry it.  At the end is a listing of
     Pittsburgh BBSs that participate in EchoMail, the phone number
     and Sysop's name.
             After finishing a draft copy of the list, I sent it to
     several Sysops and received some suggestions and error
     corrections (that's when I found out there are different
     descriptions for the same Echos).  Once corrected, a final ASCII
     file was sent to George Stanislav, 129/39, a member of my Net who
     developed the OECC program for use with Opus's *.BBS files.
     George added the OEC command and color keywords then compiled it
     with his program.  We then distributed PGHECHO.OEC, the file with
     the keywords. It was intended to serve as an OECC sample and to
     permit Sysops who wished to do so to change the colors by simply
     using a word processor's "find/replace" feature and recompiling.
     PGHECHO.BBS is an OECC compiled file meant to be inserted into
     FidoNews 5-14                Page 10                   4 Apr 1988


     the BULLETIN.BBS Menu where it can be read in color on Opus
     BBS's.  PGHECHO.LST is a straight ASCII file for our TBBS members
     and Opus boards that did not use the Bulletin menu.
             User acceptance and reaction has been very positive from
     the beginning.  It ranged from "Hey, I found a neat file on [some
     other] BBS" type of message, to one User who downloaded the ASCII
     copy and said he was going to upload it to other boards.  I
     caught him and explained that it had been distributed by netmail
     already but that some Sysops had not yet had time to post it.  It
     appears to be second only to the list of local BBS's for files
     that are read by Users.   I've since passed control of the list
     to another PittNet Sysop, Joe Fossati, 129/50. He keeps the list
     up-to-date, adding new Echo listings as they become available and
     updating the names of the boards on which each echo is available
     as boards pick up or drop Echos.

          Can someone tell me just what in the heck is going on here?
     I "thought" when I joined FidoNet, that I was joining a group of
     "hobbyists" in the telecommunications arena. I "thought" I was
     attempting to get to know great folks the likes of Tom Jennings,
     Thom Henderson, Ben Baker, Ken Shackleford, Ken Kaplan, Bob
     Hartman, and others simply too numerous to name. I "thought" I
     was going to "do my part" to further the field of personal
     computing thru telecommunications. I even "thought" that someday
     (given a lot of luck and a little assistance) that I might even
     join the ranks of the "widely-known" names in FidoNet. I find
     instead that I have joined a group of amatuer flamers, ner-do-
     wells, and "lawsuit larrys" (pun intended). I have even fallen
     prey to this generalization myself in that I "flame" from time to
     time, I speak out on what I think, and instead of "debating" the
     points of each sides views, I go completely out in left field and
     throw rocks at the other side. I am therefore making a resolution
     for myself right now that should I be confronted by flames, I
     will turn away. Should I be confronted by a sensible "debate" of
     the points of a disagreement, I will debate the points (and
     refrain from demeaning the debator) and will speak out on
     injustices where I find them. I grew tired of all the flaming and
     joined "AlterNet" where I am quite content to debate others and
     actually have managed to win a round or two there. All the
     arguing going on in FidoNet reminds me of a semi-famous Richard
     Pryor special I saw on cable wherein he was speaking of trying to
     talk rationally to another person and all they could do was hurl
     racial slurs back at him. As he put it he was no longer a man but
     he was instead a (such and such) (deleted the exact statement
     here for the sake of social politeness). I feel just about like
     that. Anyone calls me names (as have a few folks in the past) and
     I will simply stop talking to them (or typing as the case may
     be). This I feel would be excellent advice to everyone in FidoNet
     at this point in time. Debate the views, to be sure, but refrain
     from turning on the firepower and demeaning the debator. He, like
     you, as just another person, no better, no worse. He has his
     views and you have yours. It is not life threatening that you
     convince he he is wrong. You will not die if you modify your
     position a bit and see where he is "coming from" and you will
     certainly need less of the Rolaids <tm> and less of the aspirin.

     I guess the bottom line is this. Treat the other person the same
     way you expect to be treated. If you wanna be called names and
     told that you are lower the whale poop, then call him names and I
     can almost guarantee that you will get what you want. BUT if you
     want to try to understand what the other person is saying then
     LISTEN to him and then he will in turn LISTEN to you and if he
     doesn't then no amount of arguing or screaming or name calling is
     going to change their minds. Try this for 45 days....if someone
     calls you something or says something you feel offends you then
     ignore it completely. They do NOT sign your paycheck, they do NOT
     FidoNews 5-14                Page 12                   4 Apr 1988


     pay your bills and they certainly HAVE NOT yet "walked the mile
     in your moccasions". I bet that after 45 days you will have
     almost complete forgotten what was said.

                      Yet Another Complicated Komment

                            by Steven K. Hoskin
                        ( STEVE HOSKIN at 1:128/31 )

                       Episode 5:  Electronic Voting



          I don't know about  y'all  out  there,  but  I want to see a
     democratic FidoNet.  You know,  where each FidoNode gets one vote
     on matters that concern the InterNational FidoNet.

          I thought originally that was  why the InterNational FidoNet
     Association went corporate;  so  there'd be rules to follow about
     collective voting.

          As it turned out, for  whatever  reasons,  IFNA did not turn
     out to be that voting tool, that  graceful central coordinator of
     the collective will of all  FidoNet  SysOps.  One of its problems
     is that members of FidoNet are  NOT  necessarily members of IFNA.
     Therefore, IFNA cannot do things  to  control FidoNet, as FidoNet
     SysOps don't get to vote on IFNA matters if they're not IFNA.

          To join IFNA costs $25.    You  should  NEVER have to pay to
     vote on  something  that  affects  the  way  you  run  your life.
     Period.

          I joined IFNA because I thought  it would help to insure the
     survival of FidoNet during hard times.  That may still hold true,
     and I will probably be an IFNA member for life, but one thing has
     become clear to me:  IFNA IS NOT ESTABLISHING NET-WIDE DEMOCRACY.

          Don Daniels, president of IFNA, has requested ideas for ways
     to establish a fully democratic  FidoNet,  BE IT VIA IFNA OR SOME
     OTHER MECHANISM.  Now there's a man who's interested in FidoNet.

          Well, here we go again, folks, YET ANOTHER idea:  Electronic
     Voting.

          Reserve a FidoNode, just  like  1:1/0 does the NodeList, and
     1:1/1 does the FidoNews,  to  handle  strictly Electronic Voting.
     For sake of example, I'll use  1:1/9.   I don't know if this Node
     number is being used for anything, but that's my example.

          For starters, if IFNA is to be retained (as many of us would
     STILL like to see), we must adopt  a  by-law (if nothing stronger
     can be used) that states in whatever legal wording is needed that
     IFNA as an organization MUST ABIDE BY FIDONET SYSOP VOTE RESULTS.
     And that IFNA MUST  ISSUE  BALLOTS  FOR  VOTE  ON  ANY RESOLUTION
     REQUESTED BY ANY FIDONET SYSOP.

          Then get 1/9 going.  An automated  system, disallowing human
     tampering, whereby ballots and  resolutions are sent to the node,
     1/9 sends the ballot via Network  mail AUTOMATICALLY to ALL Nodes
     FidoNews 5-14                Page 16                   4 Apr 1988


     in the NodeList DIRECTLY, and waits for some predetermined amount
     of time for a vote result.

          If one month is  the  predetermined  time,  have 1/9 re-send
     ballots to any Node from  which  no  vote  has been received on a
     weekly basis until either a  vote  is  received or the time limit
     has been reached.

          As vote "ballot" messages come back to 1/9 via Network Mail,
     in   some   predetermined   format   such   that   a   relatively
     unsophisticated program can  determine  the vote, 1/9 tallies the
     vote, stores the message,  and  sends  a verification message via
     Network Mail DIRECTLY to the node that allegedly sent the ballot.

          Duplicate Node  votes  would  be  cancelled  and  the ballot
     reissued to the Node in  question  with  a note commenting on the
     duplication.

          A password  could  be  set  up  for  each  Node  and  placed
     somewhere  in  the  Ballot  return   vote  message.    Improperly
     passworded ballots would cause  1/9 to send a message DIRECTLY to
     that Node informing  him  or  her  that  a  password  failing had
     occurred.  A place for changing  of passwords could also be added
     to the ballot return message.

          This should eliminate "bogus"  node  voting, as the SysOp of
     the REAL Node could  then  be  aware  that  somebody is trying to
     break into his or her vote.

          When all Nodes have responded  OR the time limit is reached,
     1/9 forwards the vote  results  to  anybody that wants it, either
     via Network Mail or as an Echo Area.

          Have a preformed  message  format  for  requesting a ballot,
     which could be sent to  1/9  such  that  no human could interfere
     with the request for the vote.  This eliminates interference with
     the   vote   request   system  if  someone   feels   that   their
     ballot/resolution  has  not  been  properly  sent to 1/9 by IFNA.
     Improper resolutions  thusly  sent  could  be  construed as being
     "excessively annoying"  and  multiple  occurrences  of such could
     then be voted on by the Network  for  possible EXCOMMUNICATION of
     the offending Node.

          Choosing who runs Node  1/9  is  a  sensitive subject, since
     that person  could  theoretically  tamper  with  things.  There's
     simply going to have to be SOME kind of trust out there.

          This is not a full overview,  as  I  am  trying to limit the
     size of this column.  Replies, questions, comments, etc.  contact
     me as STEVE HOSKIN at Node 1:128/31.   I'd love to see this thing
     implemented.  I'd even write the software.  :-)
