     =================================================================


     Hello. It's nice to be back.

     From the look of things, most everything we got went out last
     week. I've reformatted the offending article (keep in mind that
     I reserve the right to not publish any article that MAKENEWS
     kicks out, and some night I'll get pissed and delete everything
     that doesn't make the cut!) and you'll see it this week.

     Click your heels together three times and say "There's no prez
     like Quayle... There's no prez like Quayle..." ARRRRRRGGGHHHH!

     I'm sorry you didn't like my sense of humor, Jack. Frankly, I
     found the metaphor extremely apropos. One of your most annoying
     traits, in my opinion, is your propensity for looking at things
     from the most negative possible viewpoint and throwing the baby
     out with the bathwater. You don't actually see yourself in the
     role of an optimist, do you?

     Sorry about the version updates. I'll get them in next week.


     I hope you all had a good Cinco de Mayo. I sure did.


     Enjoy your week!
     Vince

                              Wide Beta KITTEN


     I can't stand it.  I just finished catching up on  a  few  week's
     worth  of  FidoNews,  and  it  seems  to be nothing but political
     wrangling.  Doesn't anyone ever talk about FUN stuff anymore?

     So okay,  I can bitch and moan and be part of the problem,  or  I
     can  write  about  something  else.   So  I  will.  (Write  about
     something else, that is!)

     Do sysops still get a charge out of tearing  their  whole  system
     apart  and  putting it together differently?  Now that you've got
     your system fully debugged and huming along  nicely,  aren't  you
     about  ready  to  break  it  again?  Is  the humdrum existence of
     running debugged software starting to get to you?

     If so, then why not try a beta test BBS system?

     That's right,  the latest KITTEN is now available for  wide  beta
     test.  It can be downloaded or freqed (BETACAT1.ARC) from our BBS
     at (201) 473-1991 (Hey!  This is *THE YEAR* for SEAboard!)

     So  what is KITTEN,  you ask?  (Even if you didn't,  I'm going to
     tell  you  anyway,  so there!)  KITTEN is a programmable bulletin
     board program.  How it acts and what it does  are  controlled  by
     menu scripts that you can create and modify however you like (two
     sample setups are provided).

     Waitasec!  Programming?  Ugh!  Isn't that what those weirdo nerds
     do in dimly lit back rooms?  Well,  yes,  but it isn't  hard.  If
     you can write a batch file, you can program KITTEN.

     There  is  almost  no  end  to KITTEN's flexibility,  and the new
     KITTEN has been substantially beefed up.  New features include:

       * Twenty six string variables and twenty six numeric variables.

       * If we have variables, we have to be able to use them, and you
         can.  Variables can be read from and written to files,  input
         from the user, calculated on the fly, and used in conditional
         expressions.  They can also be displayed in  menus,  used  in
         commands,  and  they  can even be used in text files and file
     FidoNews 8-18                Page 3                    6 May 1991


         lists.

       * If that's not enough,  there are forty two system macros  for
         everything  from  the  caller's name to how many minutes he's
         been connected.  Wait,  let's expand that a bit -- that's how
         many  minutes he's been connected in the current session,  or
         all in all today, or in total since he first joined.

       * Just in case that isn't enough either,  you can  also  define
         your  OWN  macros  for  whatever  you  like.  You can make up
         things like "@ansi(green)" and then use them in menus,  text,
         file lists, et cetera.

       * KITTEN now supports external protocols (such as DSZ) for file
         uploading and downloading.

       * KITTEN  now  (ta  daaa!) directly supports Caller*ID.  KITTEN
         can know who is calling  your  board  before  she  even  gets
         carrier!  She  can  handle either restricted logins (user can
         only call from one number) and/or  fast  logins  (user  isn't
         asked  for  a  name),  and  their  is  a system macro for the
         caller's phone number,  so you can make use of it directly in
         menus and commands however you like.

         That  "fast login" can be a bit spooky the first time you see
         it.  Riiiing!  Connect -- "Hello,  Joe!"  But I'll  warn  you
         now,  once you get used to it you'll start getting annoyed at
         boards that have to ask you who you are!

       * Direct door support for PC Board, RBBS, QuickBBS, and RA door
         programs.

       * And lots more neat stuff.

     So,  are you ready to stir up your disk a bit?  If  so,  consider
     giving KITTEN a whirl.

                             THROUGH THE WIRE
              Commentary and News Concerning the Other World
                            by Michael A. Banks

     Copyright (c), 1990, 1991, Michael A. Banks

          Well, I was going to talk about the United States Government
     and telecomputing this time out, but I've decided to cut that in
     favor of expanding info and commentary on international
     telecomputing.  (There's not much happening in that area at the
     moment; you've read everything there is to know in the news
     magazines, or caught it on TV or radio news.)  I'll still cover
     online elitism, and give you the reading list--all as promised.
     And I'll give you something to think about regarding online
     security.
          First, let's take a look at what's happening with
     international telecomputing, on two levels.

     International Telecomputing, Level One: "The Walls Come Tumbling
     Down"
          If you're over 35 or so, you probably felt the same awe and
     sense of history as I did when you saw the Berlin Wall and all it
     symbolized come crashing down earlier this year.  After all, we
     grew up with that symbol of what was known as the Communist
     menace and--far, far worse--of the sad legacy handed Eastern
     Europe in the wake of World War II.  (My God--remember when those
     emergency broadcasting system tests used to be followed by "Had
     this been an attack ... "?)
          (In footnote to "the Communist menace," you may assume that
     I concur with Dr. Jerry Pournelle's statement on returning from
     Russia in April: "I have seen the fourth world, and it doesn't
     work.")
          Now, in less than a year, we've seen four decades of
     oppression slough away like the rotting husk of a fallen fruit,
     revealing the seeds of a new world.  Even Mother Russia is
     loosening her hold (though not too much) on satellite nations,
     and there are echoes of freedom in South and Central America.
          What does this have to do with being online?  Well, I've
     stated often enough that the online world tends to mirror the
     "real" world.  This is no less than true where the growing
     freedom of long-oppressed (politically or otherwise) nations are
     concerned.  Now that the political walls blocking free trade and
     communication in many parts of the world are coming down, so are
     the barriers to telecomputing.
          For example, U.S. Sprint has commenced setting up a quality
     data communications service for the U.S.S.R.  The Moscow-based
     service, which should be up and running by the end of the year,
     will see the installation of state-of-the-art data communications
     switching equipment, making it easier for Soviet citizens to
     telecommunicate with the rest of the world.  The service will be
     a joint venture with Russia, called "Telenet USSR" (although the
     name could change, since Telenet has been renamed "SprintNet"
     here in the U.S., in the wake of its acquisition by U.S. Sprint).
     FidoNews 8-18                Page 11                   6 May 1991


          But in this instance, the online world has been and is
     anticipating as well as mirroring real-world events.  Telenet
     USSR is not the first Soviet data link with the Western world.
     The famed Washington/Moscow "Hot Line" has been a data link for
     quite a few years.  Nor is it the first commercial link: an
     existing data communications center in Moscow routes commercial
     telecomputing traffic via SprintNet/Telenet through Vienna,
     Austria (a similar link can be made via Helsinki, Finland, though
     that route cannot handle heavy traffic).  Other links with Russia
     are made circuitously via Tymnet and, it has been rumored, over
     Internet.  Still another link, the cleverly titled San
     Francisco/Moscow Teleport (SFMT), leases time on a comsat to link
     Moscow to packet-switching networks in the U.S. via San
     Francisco.  (And now, users on the majority of American online
     services can, for a fee of perhaps five bucks for 150 words, send
     E-mail to Russia via SFMT, courtesy of DASnet, an inter-service
     E-mail carrier.  DASnet ties in to almost all major online
     services.  For more info phone 415-559-7434 voice and speak with
     Anna Lange.)
          Those links will be much in the public eye over the next 12
     to 18 months, but they are only half the story where the
     "opening" of Communist and Third-World nations are concerned.  A
     public, international BBS opened in Estonia (one of the Soviet
     Baltic states) in mid-1989, and DELPHI and CompuServe have forged
     data links with South and Central American countries.  (Text from
     sessions on some of DELPHI's links--actually, local versions of
     the DELPHI online service--are shown on these pages.  If you read
     Spanish, enjoy!)
          In these developments, the online world anticipated
     developments in the real world, as stated a few paragraphs back.
     And, there are some developments online that are unique to the
     online world.  For example, on ConnectEd (an online university
     operated in conjunction with New York's New School for Social
     Research), you'll find a service that provides essays from Soviet
     writers and commentators on all manner of topics.  (Freely
     written, I might add, and with a surprising undercurrent of
     Russian patriotism.)  (For information about ConnectEd, telephone
     212-548-0435 voice and ask for Paul Levinson.)

     International Telecomputing, Level Two: Commercial Expansion
          On a less sensationalistic plane, the three largest
     commercial online services in the U.S. are expanding into Europe
     and Japan in a big way--shrinking the global tent city (a term I
     prefer to "global village," because we all go home after those
     international interactions ... ) still more.  Here's a summary:
          CompuServe in Europe.  CompuServe is offering limited (and
     expensive) service in Europe via the CompuServe Forum.  (The
     service is lower in cost than previous means of accessing
     CompuServe via Europe, however.)  A special TOP menu has been
     created for European subscribers, and there are plans for various
     CompuServe computer forums to add sections for European users.
     Additional plans call for "CompuServe software" (whether this is
     front-end software or the service itself is not known) to be
     offered in several European languages.
     FidoNews 8-18                Page 12                   6 May 1991


          CompuServe already has access from Japan via a joint venture
     that offers CompuServe access or a mirror of same, called "Nifty-
     SERVE."
          DELPHI Introduced in Japan.  General Videotex Corporation
     (GVC), parent company of DELPHI, has created a partnership with
     Japan's ASCII Corporation to distribute DELPHI services in Japan.
     ASCII Corp., which operates one of the three largest online
     services in Japan and publishes books and magazines on computing,
     among other topics, is creating a "regional" version of DELPHI
     called ASCII NET in Japan.  According to GVC, the ASCII NET Japan
     will "supplement DELPHI's current regional partners in Buenos
     Aires, Argentina; Miami, Florida; Kansas City, Missouri; and
     Boston, Massachusetts."
          GVC and ASCII Corp. expect to sign up more than 5,000
     members during the first year of distribution.  Presumably, there
     will be an extra-charge gateway service between ASCII NET and
     DELPHI, as is the case with DELPHI in the U.S. and
     DELPHI/Argentina.   There is talk of sub-licenses to Singapore
     and/or Taiwan.
          GEnie in Europe.  GEnie is now officially online in Europe.
     The service can be dialed up directly in Austria, Germany, and
     Switzerland via networks operated by distributors of General
     Electric Information Services (GEIS), GEnie's parent company.
     Unlike CompuServe's European service, GEnie is making almost all
     the features that are available to North American subscribers
     available to European callers.  This augments international
     access from Japan, and will presumably be expanded to include
     other European countries (including the U.K.) in the near future.
          BIX Clones.  In footnote, it's worth mentioning that clones
     of BIX exist in Japan and the U.K.  These are totally without
     connection (data links or business connection) with BIX (which is
     an online service sponsored by Byte Magazine).  In Japan, the
     service is called "Nikki-MIX" and runs the same basic UNIX
     software as BIX, but with Kanji (written graphic character)
     capability.  In the U.K., the clone is called CIX; I don't know
     whether it uses the same operating system, but the structure is
     close enough.
          (You'll find screens from some Japanese services on
     accompanying pages.)

     Online Elite?
          Back on the topic of new-found telecom riches, it is worth
     noting that not everyone in Russia or in Central or South America
     has access to international telecom services--just as not
     everyone in newly "free" nations has access to the tools of
     capitalism (money and contacts.)  For example, any Soviet citizen
     can walk into the Moscow data communications center and dial up
     Europe or America--in theory.  In practice, however, access is
     limited to those who have a need to telecompute (certain
     scientists would constitute one such group), and perhaps to the
     more privileged or those with the proper contacts.  And in
     countries with little "hard currency," there is a definite upper
     limit to how much international telecomputing activity can go on
     in any event.  It's all on a "need to telecompute" basis.
     FidoNews 8-18                Page 13                   6 May 1991


          But, before you jump to conclusions about totalitarian
     telecomputing and elitism in Communist-controlled or third-world
     nations, consider the fact that telecomputing is new in Russia,
     and computer literacy is not widespread.  The same is true in
     Central and South American nations.  And in most of the countries
     to which I've alluded here, the economic situation is such that
     only a minority of those who are computer literate have the
     wherewithal to obtain the prerequisite hardware and software.
          Then consider the fact that telecomputing in the U.S. (and
     in Japan and the U.K.) is not something to which everyone has
     access; though the cost of telecomputing in both money and
     knowledge has dropped, the online world is still populated
     largely by elitists--either the techno-elite or a subset of the
     financially elite.  Those who are online otherwise remain a
     minority.
          That's going to change, however, as telecomputing becomes
     more and more a "legitimate" product/service.  And telecomputing
     will indeed become legitimate.  The majority will adopt it over
     the next decade, in the same manner as we adopted cable TV, VCRs,
     FAX machines, and telephones.  Why?  Because, like those other
     technologies, telecomputing is information exchange ... and with
     information exchange comes freedom--not to mention the desire to
     have access to everything.  (For more on the online elite, see
     the accompanying sidebar.)
          All in all, it looks as if telecomputing outside the Western
     world is merely a decade or so behind us--and catching up fast.

     Things to Come
          All this talk about what's happening with international
     telecomputing has me thinking about what the future holds.  So
     I've put together some of my thoughts on what's likely to be
     happening in the global online world (mainly involving its
     interfaces with the real world) over the next few years.
          Note that these are not straight predictions (that's a con
     game), but extrapolations to which we can assign fairly high
     probabilities.  Too, I've deleted a couple of them since I began
     writing this last month--because they came true, two or three
     years before the time I'd assigned to them.

                                1990 - 1991
          Soviet special-interest groups spring up on various online
     services.
          A few American BBS freaks dial into Eesti BBS #1 in Tallin,
     Estonia and copy off message bases and files, which are then
     uploaded to various online services and BBSs in the U.S.  Similar
     material snakes its way westward via Internet.
          Eesti BBS #1 is joined by other non-commercial Baltic and
     Eastern European BBSs.

                                1992 - 1993
          CompuServe is the first computer network to offer TASS, the
     official Soviet news service, online; the surcharged service is
     provided to CompuServe on a one-year exclusive basis for an
     undisclosed sum.
     FidoNews 8-18                Page 14                   6 May 1991


          As topics covered by Russia's American-distributed Soviet
     Life magazine continue to mirror those in various American
     cultural and news magazines, the magazine runs a special feature
     on Soviet hackers, focusing on underground BBSs in Baltic nations
     and in Leningrad and Moscow.  The tone is one of mild rebuke.
          More and more Russian citizens sign on to American online
     services under the auspices of various institutions like the
     Soviet Academy of Sciences.
          A few Eastern Europeans and residents of former Soviet
     states begin showing up on American online services, some as
     individual citizens but more under the auspices of governmental
     agencies.
          Russian and Eastern European hackers begin working the new
     packet network and other links to the West, and show up on
     Internet as well as various commercial online services and
     private BBSs.  They are particularly ingenious in their
     techniques, which require that they use relatively ancient and
     unprotected telephone technology to gateway into more
     sophisticated systems in the Western world.  They quickly
     discover that they are easily tracked and nailed, and their
     successors devise still more ingenious techniques to cover their
     trails.

                                1993 - 1995
          A cosortium consisting of General Electric, the now British-
     owned BT Tymnet, and unnamed investors vies with the combined
     forces of IBM and AT&T to win the right to provide commercial
     data communications links with Leningrad and Moscow via X.400
     communications links through Austria and Germany.  (This will
     offer links mainly with western Europe, with limited availability
     to North America and Asia.)
          GEnie, via its GEIS international X.25 service, offers
     limited service to residents of Moscow and Leningrad, as well as
     to various former Soviet states.  The links are into Western
     Europe, with packet-switching networks like U.S. Sprint and GE/BT
     Tymnet as record carriers.
          With the increasing availability of hard currency in Russia,
     a relatively large number (scores) of individual Russian citizens
     open accounts on American and British commercial online services.
     These will be professionals, intent on establishing information
     businesses and/or enhancing their own professional activities
     with information from the West.  (Behind the scenes, an arm of
     the Russian internal security service--your guess--notices the
     information interchange and begins monitoring it, with no
     expressed or real intent.)

     Online Security
          Speaking of hackers (and I was, a few dozen lines back) I've
     another bomb (well, a grenade in this case) to drop, along the
     lines of the unknown threat Wall Street and the money-heads
     mentioned in my first column.  This time it has to with computer
     data security.
     FidoNews 8-18                Page 15                   6 May 1991


          You all know what hackers are, how they break into systems
     and steal data for fun and/or profit, etc.  This, thanks to the
     mainstream news media, which portrays them in a somewhat
     glamorous vein, like modern-day counterparts of corsairs in
     historical novels.  The threat to data posed by real hackers has
     been missed, in large part, because the media prefers to focus on
     hackers who get caught, and on soi-disant computer security
     experts who emphasize the sensationalistic and speak knowingly of
     viruses.
          (Compare John xxxxx getting literally hours of air time and
     gallons of ink in the national media with FLU_SHOT+ author Ross
     Greenberg getting maybe ninety seconds on CNN.  The disparity
     comes from Ross' providing a level-headed, step-by-step approach
     to virus protection.  No blood-and-guts there ... but I digress--
     as I shall whenever I can take a shot at media airheadedness.
     After all, is not the implied purpose of the news media to inform
     rather than entertain?  Or am I inferring too much and is the
     avowed purpose of the media to not only sway but dictate public
     opinions, topple governments, and the like?)
          That's not the only threat to data and privacy that's been
     missed.  An equally dangerous threat, that of accidental data
     sharing or disclosure, has been mentioned not once in any book or
     article on computer security.
          And what constitutes accidental data sharing?  Easy: Someone
     mistakenly includes your E-mail address in a distribution list,
     or sends E-mail intended for someone else to you because your
     online ID is similar to that of the intended addressee.  I've had
     it happen several times on one system in particular.  I've
     received corporate-confidential information that conceivably
     could have been sold to a certain mega-corporation's competitors
     (something, I hasten to add, I didn't do; my ethics run counter
     to accepted Yuppie and pirate practices.  If they didn't, I
     wouldn't be scrambling to make car payments.)  I've received even
     more sensitive information.  All because someone didn't pay
     attention to what he or she was typing.  (Where this happened is
     your guess; I'm now on 31 networks with 36 IDs.)
          The hell of it is, it's something that's easily fixed.  And,
     no, I won't warn the service of it.  Not at the moment, anyway.
     Why?  I mentioned ethics a few lines back; in addition to what I
     said there, I have ethics that say "No" to professional rape.  To
     keep it short, I won't give away my knowledge and expertise to a
     large corporation when said corporation is paying kilobucks to
     employees and "consultants" who are supposed to catch this stuff.
          But, be warned; a typo, a tired person sending E-mail, or
     someone who's inattentive or untrained--any of these can result
     in sensitive data being given to those who shouldn't have it.
          (Hm ... there's a story in this, perhaps.  Let's see ... Big
     Bucks Corp. is losing big bucks because of a data leak.  The data
     leak is an accident, but it means Someone's job, so Someone
     covers his ass by inventing a hacker.  Hm ... could be
     particularly interesting if it were a national security leak ...)

     The Reading List (at last!)
          Okay, here's the skinny: Whether you're new to this stuff or
     not, buy and read any of the books on this list that you haven't
     read (yes--even mine), with the exception of those branded as
     technical if you're not of a technical bent.  I've intentionally
     left out some books that you've probably already read.
          The bottom line: Each of these is worth ordering if you
     can't find it in your favorite bookstore.

          Communications and Networking for the IBM PC and
     Compatibles, by Larry Jordan and Bruce Churchill (good if you
     want to learn the tech-hardware end of things; Brady Books/Simon
     & Schuster)
          The Cuckoo's Egg, by Clifford Stoll (you know--the
     bestseller; Bantam Books)
          The Hacker, by Chet Day (interesting horror novel involving
     hackers--ignore the reviews and judge for yourself; Pocket Books)
          The Matrix, by John S. Quarterman (non-fiction, explains
     computer networks around the world; Digital Press)
          The Modem Reference, 2nd edition by Michael A. Banks (Brady
     Books/Simon & Schuster; has everything you need to know about
     buying and using a modem, getting online, what's online, etc.)
          Synners, by Pat Cadigan (a novel, from Bantam/Spectra)
          True Names, by Vernor Vinge (a collection of short stories
     that also contains the novelette, "True Names," which is required
     reading; currently in print in a Baen Books edition)
          Understanding Data Communications (good reference for tech-
     heads; pick it up at your local Radio Shack store)
          That's a start.  I'll add books to this list under an In
     Print header next edition and each time thereafter.
                                     #
          That's it for now.  Next edition: the much-overrated compu-
     sex phenomenon, copyright theft (a bit of a scandal revealed),
     more international stuff, and whatever looks interesting.  In the
     meantime, have fun!

     The Online Elite Revisited
          Some leftover comments on online elitism ... .
          I spoke earlier in this issue (and in the previous issue)
     about an "online elite."  We networkers in the Western world are
     an elite (which I'll attempt to prove by example in a couple
     paragraphs).  But we'll become less so over the next three years
     as the cost of going online--in cash and knowledge--continue to
     drop and modem communication becomes as "legitimate" in the
     marketplace as VCRs and pizzas.
          In the meantime, a lot of people are smearing us with the
     same brush as the ubiquitous "rich man" and "Illuminati."  The
     "lot of people" are those who hear about what goes online but
     aren't online.  I've seen this happen time and again.  Basically,
     those who aren't online are afraid they're missing something
     (they are), and that they're being barred from information and
     contacts (they aren't).

          I first grappled with this issue a couple of years ago, when
     I was asked by some people in a national writers' organization of
     which I'm a member (okay, it was the Science Fiction Writers of
     America, aka SFWA) to try to quell a flap over someone not online
     misunderstanding what "goes on" online.  The best I could do (and
     it was and is legitimate) was to explain that the public,
     private, and semi-private exchange of information about which the
     offline person was paranoid was in its net effect nothing more
     than what went on via "street mail" letters, voice telephone
     conversations, and in-person chats.
          It wasn't accepted then, and it's not being accepted now.
     In my capacity as Online Committee chairperson for SFWA, I set up
     a panel at a recent SFWA event, at which one or two offline
     people in the audience made accusations of conspiracies and
     power-plays and information control on the part of those online.
     If such exist (attempts at these things exist, anyway), it is no
     more than goes on in the physical world, albeit faster at times.
          But we'll never convince those offline of that.  So the
     offline "lots of people" brand those online as an elite group,
     simply because they have access to communications channels
     knowledge (and gossip) faster.
          Interestingly enough, it has been my experience that those
     offliners who cry "Elitists!" are those who are most able but
     least likely gain access to online services.  Which is to say,
     they're the kind of people who either misunderstand things,
     and/or like to have problems.  (I'm not certain this is true in
     the latter instance, but in general it is.)
          On the other side of the coin, I should re-emphasize that
     the people you and I meet online who are not in the U.S., where
     telecom costs are low, are an elite group, indeed.  For it costs
     much in money and knowledge to get online if you're living in
     Tokyo or Buenos Aires.  It's not unlike (to haul out the realtime
     metaphor again) foreigners visiting or moving to the U.S.--you
     will rarely, if ever, meet someone from another country who was
     without money or power or special knowledge or training, or some
     special ability that enabled him or her to get here.  Thus, we
     don't really meet the "common man" via a virtual visit to other
     countries--not yet, anyway.
          But, what the heck--being part of an elite group isn't all
     bad.  (<SMIRK>, as we say online.)

     RE:     PRODIGY MAY BE STEALING PERSONAL INFO FROM YOUR COMPUTER!

     Gentlemen,

     The following file was sent to me today, April 29th.  I've read
     it twice and then had to try it out myself just to see if it was
     true.

     Whether it is a bug in the software, or a covert effort by Sears,
     IBM, and Prodigy to *STEAL* private and personal information
     from your computer, the fact remains that the STAGE.DAT file in
     the Prodigy Subdirectory digs up all sorts of information that
     would be absolutely meaningless to the operation of the
     software.

     Subject: Prodigy security warning

     While some of the enclosed article from comp.dcom.telecom is the
     usual bbs liver-chewing, the concerns about the STAGE.DAT file's
     grabbing of disk data is pretty serious.  If you have the
     Prodigy demo kit or, heaven forbid, the real thing, what do you
     find when you look in your STAGE.DAT file? -- Bob

       Prodigy: More of a Prodigy Than We Think?
       By: Linda Houser Rohbough

     The stigma that haunts child prodigies is that they are difficult
     to get along with, mischievous and occasionally, just flat
     dangerous, using innocence to trick us. I wonder if that label
     fits Prodigy, Sears and IBM's telecommunications network?

     Those of you who read my December article know that I was tipped
     off at COMDEX to look at a Prodigy file, created when Prodigy is
     loaded STAGE.DAT. I was told I would find in that file personal
     information form my hard disk unrelated to Prodigy.  As you
     know, I did find copies of the source code to our product
     FastTrack, in STAGE.DAT. The fact that they were there at all
     gave me the same feeling of violation as the last time my home
     was broken into by burglars.

     I invited you to look at your own STAGE.DAT file, if you're a
     Prodigy user, and see if you found anything suspect. Since then I
     have had numerous calls with reports of similar finds,
     everything from private patient medical information to
     classified government information.

     The danger is Prodigy is uploading STAGE.DAT and taking a look at
     your private business. Why? My guess is marketing research, which
     is expensive through legitimate channels, and unwelcomed by you
     and I. The question now is: Is it on purpose, or a mistake?  One
     caller theorizes that it is a bug. He looked at STAGE.DAT with a
     piece of software he wrote to look at the physical location of
     data on the hard disk, and found that his STAGE.DAT file
     allocated 950,272 bytes of disk space for storage.

     Prodigy stored information about the sections viewed frequently
     and the data needed to draw those screens in STAGE.DAT.  Service
     would be faster with information stored on the PC rather then
     the same information being downloaded from Prodigy each time.

     That's a viable theory because ASCII evidence of those screens
     shots can be found in STAGE.DAT, along with AUTOEXEC.BAT and
     path information. I am led to belive that the path and system
     configuration (in RAM) are diddled with and then restored to
     previous settings upon exit. So the theory goes, in allocating
     that disk space, Prodigy accidently includes data left after an
     erasure (As you know, DOS does not wipe clean the space that
     deleted files took on the hard disk, but merely marked the space
     FidoNews 8-18                Page 23                   6 May 1991


     as vacant in the File Allocation Table.)

     There are a couple of problems with this theory. One is that it
     assumes that the space was all allocated at once, meaning all
     950,272 bytes were absorbed at one time.  That simply isn't
     true.  My STAGE.DAT was 250,000+ bytes after the first time I
     used Prodigy. The second assumption is that Prodigy didn't want
     the personal information; it was getting it accidently in
     uploading and downloading to and from STAGE.DAT. The E-mail
     controversy with Prodigy throws doubt upon that. The E-mail
     controversy started because people were finding mail they sent
     with comments about Prodigy or the E-mail, especially negative
     ones, didn't ever arrive. Now Prodigy is saying they don't
     actually read the mail, they just have the computer scan it for
     key terms, and delete those messages because they are
     responsible for what happens on Prodigy.

     I received a call from someone from another user group who read
     our newsletter and is very involved in telecommunications. He
     installed and ran Prodigy on a freshly formatted 3.5 inch 1.44
     meg disk. Sure enough, upon checking STAGE.DAT he discovered
     personal data from his hard disk that could not have been left
     there after an erasure. He had a very difficult time trying to
     get someone at Prodigy to talk to about this.

                                --------------

     Excerpt of email on the above subject:

     THERE'S A FILE ON THIS BOARD CALLED 'FRAUDIGY.ZIP' THAT I SUGGEST
     ALL WHO USE THE PRODIGY SERVICE TAKE ***VERY*** SERIOUSLY. THE
     FILE DESCRIBES HOW THE PRODIGY SERVICE SEEMS TO SCAN YOUR HARD
     DRIVE FOR PERSONAL INFORMATION, DUMPS IT INTO A FILE IN THE
     PRODIGY SUB-DIRECTORY CALLED 'STAGE.DAT' AND WHILE YOU'RE
     WAITING AND WAITING FOR THAT NEXT MENU COME UP, THEY'RE
     UPLOADING YOUR STUFF AND LOOKING AT IT.

     TODAY I WAS IN BABBAGES'S, ECHELON TALKING TO TIM WHEN A
     GENTLEMAN WALKED IN, HEARD OUR DISCUSSION, AND PIPED IN THAT HE
     WAS A COLUMNIST ON PRODIGY. HE SAID THAT THE INFO FOUND IN
     'FRAUDIGY.ZIP' WAS INDEED TRUE AND THAT IF YOU READ YOUR ON-LINE
     AGREEMENT CLOSELY, IT SAYS THAT YOU SIGN ALL RIGHTS TO YOUR
     COMPUTER AND ITS CONTENTS TO PRODIGY, IBM & SEARS WHEN YOU AGREE
     TO THE SERVICE.

     I TRIED THE TESTS SUGGESTED IN 'FRAUDIGY.ZIP' WITH A VIRGIN
     'PRODIGY' KIT.  I DID TWO INSTALLATIONS, ONE TO MY OFT USED HARD
     DRIVE PARTITION, AND ONE ONTO A 1.2MB FLOPPY.  ON THE FLOPPY
     VERSION, UPON INSTALLATION (WITHOUT LOGGING ON), I FOUND THAT
     THE FILE 'STAGE.DAT' CONTAINED A LISTING OF EVERY .BAT AND SETUP
     FILE CONTAINED IN MY 'C:' DRIVE BOOT DIRECTORY.  USING THE HARD
     DRIVE DIRECTORY OF PRODIGY THAT WAS SET UP, I PROCEDED TO LOG
     ON.  I LOGGED ON, CONSENTED TO THE AGREEMENT, AND LOGGED OFF.
     REMEMBER, THIS WAS A VIRGIN SETUP KIT.

     FidoNews 8-18                Page 24                   6 May 1991


     AFTER LOGGING OFF I LOOKED AT 'STAGE.DAT' AND 'CACHE.DAT' FOUND
     IN THE PRODIGY SUBDIRECTORY.  IN THOSE FILES, I FOUND POINTERS
     TO PERSONAL NOTES THAT WERE BURIED THREE SUB-DIRECTORIES DOWN ON
     MY DRIVE, AND AT THE END OF 'STAGE.DAT' WAS AN EXACT IMAGE COPY
     OF MY PC-DESKTOP APPOINTMENTS CALENDER.

     CHECK IT OUT FOR YOURSELF.

      ### END OF BBS FILE ###

     I had my lawyer check his STAGE.DAT file and he found none other
     than CONFIDENTIAL CLIENT INFO in it.

     Needless to say he is no longer a Prodigy user.

     [Moderator's Note: Thanks very much for sending along this
     fascinating report for the readers of TELECOM Digest. I've
     always said, and still believe that the proprietors of any
     online computer service have the right to run it any way they
     want -- even into the ground! --and that users are free to stay
     or leave as they see fit. But it is really disturbing to think
     that Prodigy has the nerve to ripoff private stuff belonging to
     users, at least without telling them. But as I think about it,
     *who* would sign up with that service if they had bothered to
     read the service contract carefully and had the points in this
     article explained in detail?    PAT]

     There will not be a lot of rules other than basic rules,
     common decency (ie. no profanity, lewdness, etc), and rules
     to prevent censorship.

     Unlike the existing FIDO Bible conferences, we will not be
     practicing the censorship of doctrines or ideas.

     This will be a Christian Conference in the Biblical sense,
     but everyone is welcome regardless of religious orientation
     or lack thereof.

     This conference is "in progress" and is gated to the PRIME
     Network.

     If anyone is interested yet is unable to afford the phone
     costs, I am willing to work with people on a case by case
     basis as far as delivering the mail until we can get it on
     the backbone.

     Send netmail to 1:151/208 209 for more info.

     Please help spread the word about this new conference.

                             Steve Winter

                          The Gospel

     The gospel is the death, burial, and ressurection of the
     Lord Jesus Christ. This gospel (good news) is to be preached
     in all nations (beginning at Jerusalem).
     The gospel was first preached at Jerusalem on the the day
     of Pentecost (Acts 2:38)

     We are commanded to OBEY the gospel.(2 Th 1:8) (1Pe 4:17)
     Now..how does one OBEY the death, burial, and ressurection?

     Of course if someone did not believe, they would have no
     desire to obey.  Jesus told Nicodemus a couple of very
     important things in John 3:16 and John 3:5, he said that
     those who believeth SHOULD not perish. He had just told
     Nicodemus that he HAD to be born AGAIN two ways. One water,
     one of Spirit.

     What does water and Spirit have to do with the gospel?

     Well, the first gospel sermon preached to sinners was
     Acts 2:38."....Repent, and be baptised every one of you in the
     NAME of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall
     receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.

     Here we are: water (baptism) and Spirit (the gift of the Holy
     Ghost). IN repentance a person dies to sin; the 'old' man
     dies. The Bible says that we are "buried with Christ in
     baptism" (Romans 6:4) or baptised into his death.
     The Holy Ghost is the Spirit of Christ living in the
     Christian, the hope of glory, the hope of ressurection.

     So there you have death, burial, and ressurection..the gospel.
     And the way that the apostles taught to obey it.
     Have you obeyed the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ?
     Gal 1:8, Acts 2:39, Acts 10:44-48, Acts 11:5, Acts 19:1-6.
