     =================================================================

     Greetings,

     Nothing much new this week.

     Some poor soul broke into my car and managed to rip out the radio,
     but he was caught in the act, just as he managed to break the window
     on my wife's car. (Auto for some of you. ;-) )

     Why poor soul you may ask.

     When he was asked the question to what he was looking for, he replied
     ever so brightly, 'money'.  So why was the radio removed?  That's
     money, if he sells it, came the reply.  What can one say.

     It must be remembered, here in South Africa, we have a extremely high
     unemployment and stealing from those who have it, is part of todays
     living.

     So, have the car repaired and living carries on, until it gets
     broken into once more, as that is the norm around here these days.

     Zone 5 www site is down at the present moment, as it is being moved
     to a new location.  Give it until the end of the week and all should
     be well again.

     Happy reading,

     I have this annoying trait of calling those I speak with "members of
     Fidonet."  At least, it must be annoying to some, as I'm constantly
     reminded that moderators are not members of Fidonet, users are not
     members of Fidonet, point systems are not members of Fidonet...

     What _is_ Fidonet, anyway, that folks who make important
     contributions are not considered among the ranks?  Do I not come
     here to participate in the echoes, created by those moderators?  Do I
     not enjoy the conversations with those users and point systems?

     Is Fidonet just the technical organization?  Is it just composed of
     the keepers of the key to entry, the BBS?  If so, then Fidonet is
     truly dying:  those who breathe life into Fidonet have found new
     roads and don't need the key to the old gates any more.

     Or is Fidonet the community, only with a huge underclass?  Then how
     long will we survive when the underclass has an option to leave, and
     we're setting up an atmosphere where even the Microsoft Network
     looks friendly by comparison?

     I'm a member since I'm on the nodelist, I've been told.  I used to
     own one thirty-five thousandth according to my nodelist compiler.
     However, it's been a long time since I stayed up nights and watched
     my batch files run the compiler.  I've been advised that my share
     got smaller as Fido got bigger, but that my share has _really_ grown
     of late.  Whatever, on my thirty-five thousandth (or greater) share,
     there is no underclass!

                                A Star is Born

     While the shepherds of Fido abide their flocks, wise men watched the
     star in the East... and the one in the South, and the one in the
     North.  But Lisa Gronke was watching the signs, and found a new star
     in the Northwest.  She noted it in the scriptures with these very
     words:

     'My, my.....
     'My nerd instincts ask "Why does it [the backbone] do that [make a
     fourth ZHub]?"
     '.....and with so little fanfare....'

     Lisa refers, of course, to the North American Backbone, the major
     distribution system in Fidonet Zone 1.  The new Star is Bob
     Seaborn, announced with a quiet "ahem" by John Souvestre at the end
     of his stirring weekly summary of echomail changes, BACKSTAT.NA.
     The list of Zone Hubs has previously only included three:

     Zone Hubs:
     Eastern Star   George Peace        1:270/101    george@paonline.com
     Southern Star  John Souvestre      1:396/1      johns@sstar.com
     North Star     Ken Wilson          1:12/12      kwilson@ccai.com
     NorthWest Star Bob Seaborn         1:140/1      bob@nwstar.com

     Perhaps the lack of fanfare which Lisa noted was because Bob Seaborn
     is hardly a stranger to echomail distribution.  He's long flown the
     "NorthWest Star" origin line in his outspoken postings in
     administrative echoes, and has long been the key player in that
     "other" major distribution system, the FidoSpine.  In fact, he was
     already connected to George Peace and Ken Wilson, though only
     recently in a "fully connected triangle topology" (a connection
     which aids in the prevention of duplicates, which Lisa has patiently
     explained in the echoes).

     This star-watcher would like to welcome Bob's ascendancy, and
     anxiously awaits Lisa Gronke's analysis of the new topology.
     Perhaps she'll dub it a "superimposed triangles topology" or perhaps
     it can now be known as a "tetrahedron topology with two open and two
     closed corners."

     QEDIT Echo has a new name.
     FIDONEWS 15-40               Page 4                    5 Oct 1998


     By Stu Turk, 1:129/26, sturk@telerama.com

          QEDIT, the support Echo for SemWare Corporation's popular text
     editor, has been renamed to SEMWARE.  This was due to SemWare's loss
     of the trademark and their request that the name be removed from the
     EchoList.  The editor itself has been renamed to The Semware Editor
     Jr (TSE Jr for short.)  The current shareware demo version can be
     found on many FidoNet boards as TSEJR40C.ZIP and ftp from semware.com.
          The new name reflects the fact that SEMWARE is also the support
     Echo for SemWare's other text editors, including the larger and more
     powerful The Semware Editor Pro (TSE Pro, TSE Pro/32 for Win95) and
     other products.
          Information on SemWare editors can be found at
     http://www.semware.com.
         If you followed the QEDIT Echo in the past, turn on the new
     SEMWARE Echo.  The SemWare mailing list is being gated into the Echo
     and SemWare's Technical Support staff participate.
