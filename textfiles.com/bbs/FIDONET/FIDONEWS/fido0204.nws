                    HOT NEWS

        Changes are a foot. Afoot. Let me start over ...

        You may have noticed there was no FidoNews last
week. I was traveling, and busy also. When I finall yfound
time to do it, it was Thursday, so I thought, why bother,
there will be one on Monday. So ...

        FidoNews will be coming out biweekly. Thats every
other week. It's just too much work to do once a week;
missing two days (like last week) means its only five days
til the next newsletter.

        On the same subject, please not the article
submission changes. This is very important; I cannot handle
text anymore that doesnt conform to the very simple format
described. I spent three hours, formatting text to make this
issue. Next week will be the last week I'll accept text from
every possible word processor in the world, to let the word
filter out. After that, a polite note requesting that you
cange the format.

        I had to leave out a nice article on the SoCal
network, the most complex so far, as it blows up my text
formatter for some unknown reason. I'll try to get it
working by next week.

             ARTICLE SUBMISSION

        All articles you see in this issue are written by
users and sysops, and have one way or another managed to
consume disk space on Fido #1. In order to get rid of them,
and free up my precious disk space, I include them here,
then quickly delete them. Then they are YOUR problem.

EDITORIAL CONTENT:

        Totally up to you; I publish anything at all.
Article are generally Fido or BBS related; this is by no
means a decision on my part, nor a requirement.

FOR SALE, WANTED, NOTICES:

        Pretty much self explanatory. Commercial ads are
welcomed, if of reasonable length. These will be run each
issue, or until I lose them. (Dont laugh, Ive already lost a
few.)

SUBMITTING AN ARTICLE:

        Manage to get a copy of your article to Fido #1,
preferably by Fidonet mail, or by uploading. If manual
upload, please put it in the MAILFILE area, so that I can
find them all at once.

ARTICLE FORMAT: VERY IMPORTANT! PLEASE READ!

        The requirements are a little tighter in this
department, due to purely practical constraints. I cannot
devote hours to converting every text format in the world to
the one I use.

1.      NO LEFT MARGINS! Flush left please. These are
        extremely difficult to remove. 

2.      RIGHT MARGIN AT COLUMN 60 OR LESS! Less is OK,
        more is definitely not. This includes fancy 
        boxes, dotted lines, etc.

3.      KEEP FUNNY CONTROL CHARACTERS TO A MINIMUM!
        This includes formfeeds and other oddities.
        These areent as dificult to handle, but on long
        files still takes a while.

4.      WORDSTAR IS FINE IF THERE ARE NO LEFT MARGINS!

5.      PLAIN ASCII (EDLIN, ED, etc) IS FINE IF LINE LENGTH
        IS UNDER 60 COLUMNS!

6.      NO GRAPHIC CHARACTERS! Believe it or not, not every
        one in the world has an IBM PC. My computer 
        understands printable characters from 20 hex to







fidonews     --           04 Feb 85  23:18:58           Page 4

        7e hex. (Space to tilde) This is ASCII; "American 
        Standard Code for Information Interchange". We are
        "Interchanging Information". Everything else is 
        GARBAGE. ASCII is universal; Graphics are not.

7.      TOTAL ARTICLE LENGTH: Up to you; note, however, that
        I will probably avoid publishing dictionaries, 
        bibles translated into NAPLPS, and ASCII encoded
        LANDSAT pictures of Russian wheat farms.

8.      WHERE ON EARTH IS THIS ARTICLE FROM? Well ... good
        question! A good idea to identify yourself
        somewhere, unless you wish to remain anonymous. 
        Thats OK too, but I may balk at publishing rude 
        or otherwise racy submissions.

9.      AN EXAMPLE:

Article from Tom Jennings
Fido #1 4 Feb 85

        Here is what an article could look like for
submission. Very simple: plain old dumb ASCII, WordStar,
PMATE, Vedit, or whatever. WordStar Document mode is fine.
Note no left column; that is done when FidoNews is
published. Note the total width is only 60 columns; it looks
narrow on your screen, but fine when formatted later.


        END irrational tirade on text files ... on to bigger
and better things!




                      BASCOM BUGS


     A number of errors discovered in IBM's BASIC Compiler
version 1.00, by Tom Hanlin at the kind invitation of the
Sysop of The Bear's Den (FIDO 74).

     Cursor control:  BASICA allows the cursor to be moved
right, left, up, and down, respectively, by PRINTing the
following ASCII characters: 28, 29, 30, and 31.  Thus PRINT
CHR$(29);" ";CHR$(29);  does a destructive backspace, which
ought to be the job of CHR$(8), but for some obscure reason
isn't.  The BASIC Compiler will execute this example with no
trouble--it can handle moving the cursor backwards and
forwards, but not up and down.  Interpreted BASIC programs
which use the cursor control codes may have to be modified
for this reason.

     File errors:  In BASICA, if you try to open a file
using a filename that's too long (for instance THIS-IS-TOO-
LONG.TXT), you will get the error you would expect: a "Bad
File Name".  The compiler sees things differently, and will







fidonews     --           04 Feb 85  23:19:05           Page 5

give you a "Bad File Number" error.  So, if you write a
program with error trapping routines, be sure to trap for
"Bad File Number" as well as the expected "Bad File Name"
error.  This will be important mostly in programs where the
file name is entered by the user, or maybe generated by the
program, rather than a constant value.

     Literal strings:  The BASIC interpreter will allow you
to use only two control codes as literal values in strings,
ASCII characters one (CTRL-A) and four (CTRL-D).  That is,
while it's ok to use A$="x" where "x" is the control code
for these two values, for any other control code (characters
with ASCII values less than 32) you must use A$=CHR$(xx),
where "xx" is the ASCII value of the control code.  That is,
of all the control codes, only CTRL-A (smily face) and CTRL-
D (diamond) can be entered directly into the program without
causing it to bomb out.  This has to do with the way BASICA
stores programs in memory.  The point of all this is that
BASCOM evidently doesn't expect to see any control codes
directly entered, and will act strangely if you have them in
the program.

     BASCOM Machine language subroutines:  When doing a CALL
ABSOLUTE, the memory location at the start of the routine
should be entered as an integer variable at the end of the
parameter list, if any, rather than being used as the name
of the function, as BASICA does it.  BASCOM does not check
to be sure that this value is an integer, or even a numeric
value!  For instance, if you've made a mistake, and have a
string variable at the end of the parameter list, BASCOM
will not say a word.  Your program, when it attempts to
execute this function, will go off into never-never land. 
So be careful!  Another problem is that an integer variable
is required, whereas the value you want to use may often be
greater than 32767, the maximum value for a string.  This
can be fixed by setting a single-precision variable equal to
the number, then converting it to hexadecimal and back
again, which converts the number into integer range so it
can be used... the reason is a little to esoteric to discuss
here, but it does the job.  Like so:  A!=START.OF.ROUTINE :
A% = VAL( "&H" + HEX$( START.OF.ROUTINE )) : CALL ABSOLUTE(
A% )

     If you have any comments or questions, please send them
to me at The Bear's Den (FIDO 74) via Fidonet and I'll do my
best to get back to you.
       FINALLY!                                   1-20-85
       The Results From the Survey             by Linda Rene
       COMPUTER VS. FAMILY                     CO-SYSOP FIDO27

 The majority of hours spent on the computer for the married
 person was 11-20 hours weekly. For a single person it was
 21 hours and over.
 55% of computer users had no problem with their spouse; 40%
 were not so lucky and definitely had problems with spouse;
 then there was the other 5% who had no problem.SOMETIMES!
 As for friends, they either like the computer or they don't.

 The ones who like the computer are usually the ones who know 
 how to use one; the dislikers are simply nonusers and can't
 understand how a computer could be better than a party.
 The purposes for the personal computer range from business,
 word processing,programming,recreation,education and of course
 communication, etc...
                                                                           
 HOW DOES THE HOME COMPUTER EFFECT FAMILY LIVES?
    Being the wife of a system operator,I was curious to see if
 this 'computer craze' was going on outside of this house. I thought
 I was the only woman competing against a computer for a man. There was
 a time when I thought all I had to do was look pretty to keep my
 man; now I have to have brains too? 
    I'll be honest with you. When I first began this survey some
 months ago, I wanted to scrape up all the garbage I could about
 computers. Why? I'll tell you why. I hated them. I was against them
 all the way. A person can get tired of being put aside all the time
 for a piece of machine. It gets pretty bad when you forget what your
 own husbands face looks like, although the back of his head was
 always there. I couldn't admit it then but I can now. I was jealous
 of our computer and on occasion I still am. And from some of the
 comments made in the survey I am not alone in these feelings.
 One man commented, " She hates it. Has unplugged it in an attempt
 to crash it". Another wrote " It ain't that great for your love life".
 I'm sure alot of us can relate to that.
    Okay I said what I wanted to say. But to stick up for all you
 computer widows as myself, I'd like to ask all computer users to
 at least remember us! PEOPLE HAVE FEELINGS; COMPUTERS DON'T.
    Now we get on with the better half of my opinion. I'm stuck!
 I can't find any garbage about home computers. They may be hard to 
 walk away from and time consuming. Yet we can't ignore the fact
 that computers and families go together. For our childrens education
 as well as our own. Fun for the whole family. To help with the 
 household finances and so much more.
 I never thought I would be saying this but in the long run,
 computers aren't that bad. I have met a few people from our system
 and I consider them friends now. To me, that's the special part of
 computing. Making new friends every day with people all over the world.
 And you can never have too many friends. Right?                    
  I HOPE YOU ENJOYED READING THIS AS MUCH AS I DID WRITING IT!

Subject: HP LaserJet Printer

In response to an earlier article about setting up a 
printing service I don't really have a direct comment. But I
would like to bring up an important point. In my opinion,
the HP LaserJet is like a lot of other HP computer products,
good idea, but flawed implementation (close, but no cigar). 

Specifically, the HP LaserJet is deficient in two areas: 
interface compatibility and graphics. As delivered by HP the
Laserjet is only directly usable as a dumb, back-spacing







fidonews     --           04 Feb 85  23:19:24           Page 7

line printer (to borrow the old Wordstar definition). It
does not respond to any industry standard or de facto
standard command streams for direct control over special 
features (like highlighting, underlining, bold printing,
etc.) What a shame!

Secondly, the resident ram in the controller is so small
that the printer cannot:

A. Download a complete character set for user defined fonts
of any real complexity.

B. Generate anything other than limited graphics. The
graphics it can do can only be accessed by coding new
routines in your software to create them. (Lotus 1-2-3 for
the HP computer was recoded to use the LaserJet. Normal
software that generates graphics cannot be used.) Not every
software guy is a lucky as Lotus to get a multi-million
dollar order from HP to justify converting to their view of
things.

Now, fortunately there is some good news. The HP LaserJet is
based on an OEM laser mechanism known as the "Canon Engine"
(named after the company that sells it [Japanese, of
course]. This mechanism has been used in several other laser
printers, the most prominent now being the just unveiled
Apple MacIntosh companion.

A small (relatively) company named QMS in Mobile Alabama 
also sells a laser printer based on the Canon. QMS 
manufactures special controllers for laser printers; they
have been doing it for many years. They simply interfaced
their existing controller (68000 with 2 megabytes of
graphics memory) to the Cannon engine. This results in a
great device (in the same ball park as the Apple but 
machine/computer independent). Unfortunately this printer
with controller is about $10,000.

The good news is that QMS just came out with a new version. 
This model, called the QMS Smartwriter, puts a subset of
their big controller INSIDE the printer itself. The entire
thing looks identical to the HP LaserJet (no big box
controller plugged in like the other model.)

This new printer controller was made with the right ideas. 
It provides full emulation of Diablo and Qume letter 
quality printers. Thus, your existing software can be
configured as if driving a Diablo or Qume! Instant
compatibility with the tons of WP and other software
written.

Secondly, this integrate controller has enough local memory
to provide complete emulation of EPSON compatible graphics. 
This means that any program that generates graphics for an
EPSON printer (which is the universal standard) can drive
the Laser!








fidonews     --           04 Feb 85  23:19:32           Page 8

Sounds like a winning product. I plan to get my hands on 
one soon to evaluate, if everyone is interested, I will
report back the results.

P.S. I have no vested interest in QMS, and if their product
turns out to be flawed, I will be the first one to let you
know.

Subject: Letters to the editor

Several times while reading this newsletter I have thought
of short, simple comments or questions which, although
important, are not worthy of a full "article". This leads me
to suggest that Tom add a new filename extension (.LET?) for
use as letters to the editor. These could be printed at the
beginning of each news letter, and any replys from Tom could
follow. I think this would enrich the content of the
newsletter and could hold all sorts of information that
would be normally posted as a message (as opposed to a file)
on a BBS.

Synopsis: this article describes a Fido-Wide project
encouraging the  development of powerful, public domaing
tools 

User-Supported software is a logical extension of the hacker
movement.  It is  rooted in people who solve problems for
themselves, who recognize the solution is of value to
others, but that  distribution it is a pain.  However, some 
distribution probably helped in the development of the
products.  The synergy  between user and developer is
essential in the growth of any software product. 

Today, very little commercial software is produced by a
single programmer.   Even fewer are produced and marketed by
a single individual.  There are very  few people with all
the talents needed to address these needs, and the few  that
do probably don't have enough time and are probably being
paid very well  to do something else.

The first major pieces of "FreeWare" were communications
packages.   Communications tools still dominate the freeware
"market".  Why people insist  on re-inventing the wheel is
slightly beyond me; that is part of the reason  for this
article.

The first major departure in the individualistic approach
was Kermit.  (We  will discuss the other major departure,
the selling of "Freeware", another  time.)  Kermit was
professionally designed, and is professionally supported, 
but is a totally open system.  The individual
implementations are handled by  individuals or groups with
no formal affiliation to the original developers.   Unlike
previous FreeWare, Kermit is exponentially more potent than
normal comm tools because of the range of machines it
addresses.

[Ed. Note: Kermit is totally unsuitable as the main file
protocol for micros; it should be used only where absolutely
necessary, for mainframes. It is extremely slow, and has
design problems. ]

Fido is a perfect tool for the development of User-supported
software.  It has the ability to nationally organize a
collective project, without supporting  any large
corporation doing it (except maybe The Phone Company.)

The purpose of this document is to propose such a project. 
There are a number of possibilites; but the one that is most
attractive seems to be a converter  of tool formatted data.

Communications tools allow the transfer of data between
machines.  The tool I  propose will allow the conversion of
data between various (PC-DOS) tools, like Lotus or Multi-
Plan.

Sure, most commercial tools have the ability to read one or
two of the more popular data formats.  However, they are not
as all encompassing as we might like.

How would this project work?  Well, we would carefully
define what our tool's internal data model is.  Then, we
would have to carefully define the overall structure of tool
specific modules that convert data between our internal
model and the model of the particular tool.  A couple of
obvious tools would be addressed during this process.

Then, people with familiarity with particular tools would
apply same to develop the input and output modules for their
favorite tool.

There are a couple of major questions that need to be
addressed before that phase.  First of all, what tools do we
plan to address?  Do we limit ourselvesto MS/PC-Dos tools? 
What development tools will be used?

More important than this is a clear understanding of the

ownership of this work.  It is to be public domain in the
purest sense of the word; it has to begiven the collective
nature of the work.

There are some obvious extensions to this particular tool. 
One is the development of a full-fledged, integrated package
based on our internal transfer model.

There are a number of other projects that are appropriate to
this form of development.

Future editions of this column will outline some of the
preliminary specifications drawn up for this project, other
potential projects, your reactions, and other stuff.

Subject: A suggestion for naming Fido News Files
Is there any reason why the first part of the name has to
be FIDONEWS?  If you loosen that requirement, then a whole
lot of names become available.  If you put the volume and
issue numbers in the first part of the file, then they won't
be hidden by the Q, when squeezed.  For Instance:

Assume vv is volume number (why not plan ahead to volume 10!),
and nn is issue number.

     Unsqueezed File Name     Squeezed File Name
     --------------------     ------------------

        NEWSvvnn                 NEWSvvnn.QQQ
        NEWSvvnn.BBS             NEWSvvnn.BQS
        FIDOvvnn.NEW             FIDOvvnn.NQW
        FIDOvvnn.NWS             FIDOvvnn.NQS

I think one of these (or something like it, would solve the
problem quite well.

   The  paperless  office  was  a  dream  of  the  1970s.  
Like   the turbo-nuclear automobile  of the  1960s, however, 
it walloped head-on into technological reality and became
just one more pipe dream in  the legacy of computing.  The
result?  Paper, to all appearances, will  be with us for
quite some time.
 
   On a less noticeable  front, however, there's a  genuine
revolution in the works.  Electronic  mail, an extension of 
the paperless-office concept, is taking  off as no  "expert"
ever imagined.   It seems that while the office of the
future  may not be paperless, the post  office of the future
certainly will be.  Come to think of it, it's not  going to
happen in the future at all; it's happening here, now,
today.
 
   At the forefront of the  revolution are services such as 
MCI's MCI Mail  and  Western  Union's  EasyLink,  both of
which allow electronic composition, storage and transmission
of all sorts of correspondence.
 
   But  the  guerrilla  movement  of  electronic  mail  uses 
FidoNet. Borrowing  concepts  from  high-powered  systems 
such  as ARPANET and Usenet, this free, public-domain system
has no equal, commercially  or technically, in the world of
microcomputing.
 
   FidoNet  allows  users  to  fashion  their  own  public,
private or semi-private   electronic-mail   network   using  
standard   PCs  and conventional telephone lines.
 
 
                    Differences and Similarities
                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   Aside from its minimal operating environment -- IBM PCs
--  FidoNet is  only  marginally  different  from the high-
profile electronic-mail networks.  As with those  systems,
FidoNet users can  compose messages on a  built-in text 
editor, address  the messages  to other users and forget
about  the rest  of the  process.  Message  and file
packaging, addressing and transmission are  totally
transparent to the  user.  In other regards,  however,
FidoNet  is vastly  different from  the other services.
 
   With its ancillary  program -- called  Fido -- FidoNet 
offers much more than  just a  mail system.   The software 
can act  as a complete central  communications  link  to 
other Fido-equipped computers.  But Fido and FidoNet,
although they  are part of the same  system, perform
different functions for different purposes.
 
 
   Fido is  the software  that constitutes  a computer-based

"bulletin board" system (BBS).  Like other BBSs, it allows
users to call in  and gain access to message and file areas. 
In the message areas, they can leave messages for each
other,  for the general user community  or for the system 
operator --  the "sysop".   In the  file areas,  users can
download  programs  --  be  they  business,  entertainment 
or utility software -- for  use on their  own systems. 
ASCII  text files can  be handled as well.
 
   FidoNet is the  feature that pushes  this software into 
a class of its  own.   An  integral  part  of  the  Fido 
system,  FidoNet  is  a full-fledged electronic-mail network 
that links Fido  users together. Any computer system capable
of running the Fido software can become  a part of the net.
 
 
                            How It Works
                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   Here's how FidoNet works: Take, for example, the Acme
company, with small  satellite  offices  throughout  the 
country.   Acme  needs  to transfer documents  and files  to
the  home office  on a  daily basis. FidoNet might be the
answer for them.
 
   Users at  each local  office write  messages and  address
files  to other  users  at   other  nodes  throughout   the 
day.   At   a  time predetermined and agreed upon by  each
of the node operators,  usually in the wee hours of the
morning when long-distance chrages are lowest, each node
automatically switches from Fido to FidoNet operation.
 
   Messages and files are bundled into "packets" and
addressed to each of the other nodes.  If there are four
messages for station five, they are bundled  into one 
packet; the  six messages  and three  files for users of
node 10 are bundled into yet another packet, and so on.
 
   Each node then begins a process  of calling the nodes for
which  it has mail packets  and waiting for  calls that may 
come in from  nodes that  are  sending  mail.   If  a  node 
is  busy sending or receiving packets, the calling node 
either moves on to  other tasks or waits  a random length of
time before trying  to call again.  In any case,  the
messages and files that  make up a packet  are eventually
sent to  the correct destination.
 
   At the end of the  FidoNet timespan (usually one-half to 
one hour) all nodes return to Fido operation.
 
   Users with access to FidoNet can compose messages for 
transmission to users at  other locations.  Since  FidoNet
uses standard  telephone lines and  unadorned modem-equipped 
PCs, users  of the  net can  be a room, a block or a
continent apart.
 
   Once  FidoNet  is  installed,  expenses  are  minimal.  







fidonews     --           04 Feb 85  23:20:23           Page 14

Except for late-night long-distance charges -- the cheapest
available --  FidoNet doesn't cost a penny.  Messages can 
be sent across the country for  a mere fraction of  the
costs charged  by other carriers  and in a  much more timely
fashion than the U. S. Postal Service provides.
 
 
   There  are  some  minuses,  however.   First,  FidoNet 
is  not  as time-sensitive  as  other  electronic  mail.  
Mail  is  only  sent in "packets" to other nodes, and 
usually only once a day.   The software can be configured to
send mail more frequently, however.
 
   Second, FidoNet  requires a  high degree  of operator 
maintenance, which varies with the complexity of the system. 
Maintaining a  public system  using   all  the   FidoNet 
capabilities   can  become   quite time-consuming;  a 
private  Fido  system  requires  far less time and effort.
 
   FidoNet mail can include messages  that are composed on
the  rather primitive line-oriented text  editor, which
allows  a bare minimum  of functions.
 
   All messages are edited line by line, and once the
message has been completed and saved to disk, no more
changes can be made.
 
   Fortunately,  files  generated  by  other  word 
processors  can be "attached" to Fido-generated messages,
allowing some real power to  be applied  to  the  messaging 
portion  of  the  program.  Additionally, FidoNet can
transmit  binary files such  as programs, spreadsheets  or
accounting  data.   The  user  need  only  attach  the  file
to a mail message.
 
   The biggest chore  facing a potential  operator/user of
FidoNet  is getting the software.   This can be  done by
contacting  Fido Software through  the  mail  or  by 
calling  a  Fido  node and downloading the software 
directly  from  that  system.   Fido-node  telephone numbers
normally  can  be  gotten  from  many  of the thousands of
private BBS systems across the country.
 
   There  are  currently  about  125  unrestricted Fido
systems up and running throughout  the United  States, and 
lately, the  rest of  the world.  (One node is running in
Indonesia, another in England.)
 
   Each node has a unique, identifying number, which
functions as both an "address" for  electronic mail and  a
method for  synchronizing the network during transmissions.
 
 
                             Ease of Use
                             ~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   It  took  a  few  days  for  this system operator to







fidonews     --           04 Feb 85  23:20:30           Page 15

understand and install Fido.  Part of this  is due to the
hasty  documentation, which has since been  rewritten. 
Part, also,  is because the  design of the software begs a
substantial amount of fine-tuning.  The  configuration that
is developed  on the first  day of installation  may be
radically different  a  week  later.   As  a  systematized
method for using Fido develops in an organization,  the Fido
configuration will  change even more dramatically.
 
   Fido seems to be a comparatively secure system.  This
user was  not able to break  through any of  the user
interfaces  established by the software, nor was I  able to
gain entrance  to files or messages  that were beyond my
"privilege level"  or security clearance.  When the  /M
command switch was invoked, turning my board into a private
system,  I found no method for an unauthorized user to break
in.
 
 
   When a new  user logs onto  the system, he  is asked for 
a name, a password  and  the  city  and  state  from  which
he is calling.  That information  is  automatically  entered 
into  a  "user  log",   which maintains information  on the 
user's first  log-on date,  most recent log-on and 
privilege level.   The system  operator can  alter most of
these  specifications  with  the  Sysop  utility program
that works in conjunction with Fido.
 
   The six privilege levels  -- Twit, Disgrace, Normal, 
Privel, Extra and Sysop -- are a security  provision of
Fido, allowing the sysop  to control  access  to  the 
system.   New  users  are  generally given a privilege level
of Normal, which  allows a wide degree of  flexibility in
system use.   At the other  extremes, the aptly  named
"Twit" level allows virtually  no use  of the  system, while 
"Sysop" allows  total system control.
 
   In addition, all system commands can be assigned
privilege  levels. For example, the  kill file command 
would usually be  assigned to the Sysop  level;  general 
users  would  not  be given the prerogative to recklessly 
erase  files  from  the  system.   On  the other hand, the
message and  file commands,  which allow  users to  move
from the main Fido  area  into  the  message  and  file
areas, would be assigned the lowest possible  privilege
levels.   Otherwise, low-level  users would not be able to
access anything on the system.
 
 
                         System Construction
                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   Fido and its main operational  files reside in a "root" 
directory, while  the  subsidiary  message  and  file  areas 
are actually MS-DOS subdirectories.  Each  subdirectory can 
have a  general content name, such  as  "worksheet"  for 
spreadsheet  templates  or  "message"  for messages to other







fidonews     --           04 Feb 85  23:20:38           Page 16

users.  Fido keeps track of which subdirectories are message 
areas,  which  are  file  areas  and which privilege level
is necessary to use a given area.
 
   In most ways, Fido is  a self-maintaining system, able to 
continue 24-hour operation with little operator
intervention. 
 
   The program exhibits some  minor idiosyncrasies, though
none  seems totally debilitating.   Most "bugs"  are
promptly  attended to  by the developer of the  software,
Tom Jennings.   New versions, updates  and corrections  are 
released  constantly.   A  healthy group of longtime users
constantly supplies  the tyros with  tips, fixes and  news
about the system.  In  other words, Fido  has a healthy  and
growing support group that should be able to help answer
many questions and solve  the inevitable problems of getting
the system up and running.
 
   Fido is a remarkably interesting example of public-domain
software. It warrants attention because it  is apparently
the sole example  of a PC-based electronic  messaging and 
file-transfer system.   It is  the only software for
microcomputers that uses some of the features  found on
larger electronic-mail systems such as Usenet.
 
   Certainly, FidoNet will  not suit the  needs of everyone.  
Sizable corporations would find this  package laughably 
inefficient for their operations.  On the  other hand, small 
departments within those  same corporations might find  Fido
ideal for  certain tasks.  For  many, at the unbelievably
low price of $0.00, FidoNet will certainly be worth a
try.

 We are a company which provides computer
consulting,software development  ,training and other
services. Some time ago we embarked on time/cost consuming
research program to find the best database system for the
IBM PC class micro. After evaluating many many databases
REVELATION clearly came out the winner. The bottom line
reasons, Upmost Flexibility,power, system approach of the 
software , and ease of use. We have since developed a great
many applications using REVELATION. Revelation includes a
very powerful query language, database  design tools, a
fully built-in language that resembles a combination of
BASIC  ,PASCAL and C which includes very powerful database
commands as well as Trig  ,and Log functions !, a Full-
screen editor for programming or forms design, a 
telecommunications module and more. Revelation will use as
much memory as your  machine has to 640K. Minimum is 320K. 
   Some great features:   Variable length fields: when
defining a field in your database you need not  define how
many characters have to be in that field. Most other
database  require you to define how many characters will be
in a field. So for instance  if you defined your Zip code
field to contain 5 characters and later changed  to the 9
character zip code you would be in great trouble, in
Revelation no  problem you just input as many characters as
you wish . Variable length fields  can also save you lots of
disk space. A client of ours had a DBASE application  which
took 38K of space on disk. After converting over to
Revelation the same  file only occupied 8K!  Multi-valued
fields allow you to save much disk storage as well as
organize  your data more efficiently. For example I know
someone who had a file under  DBASE that was 39K .After
converting over to Revelation the same file was 8K!
Multivalued fields allows you to have more than one value
per field for the  same record!

 Symbolic fields allow you to have a formula in them that
can be used for  calculations, looking up information in
other files or could contain a 34K  RBASIC (Revelation's
programming language) program!  Joining of information of
several files is done 'on the fly' no need to dump  the data
to another file before you can even see the data.  Any
command which Revelation has YOU can give your own name to.
For instance  instead of: List Customers ,you can have GIMME
Customers. In fact you could  have dozens of names for the
same commands. This is also true of fields you  define for
your databases I.E. List Customers Name,List Customer
Contact, List Customers Friend, Can all mean the same thing. 
An interesting approach Cosmos took was to contract customer
support to a  company calld ELF. They can be reached in the
U.S. at 1-800-422-2511. The  support they provide is
incredible . I have found them able to answer  questions for
those who don't know a program from a database to those who
want  help on a specific application to altering Revelation
source code itself etc..  Cosmos provides SOURCE CODE for
parts of Revelation so that you can modify  it. Another
incredible fact about ELF if you call and they are tied up
they  will take your name and number and say they will call
you back. Guess what  they really do call you back! All in
all I would say that of all the hardware  and software
products we have delt with Elf provides the best technical 
support I have seen yet. They also publish a monthly Journal
called REVTECH  that provides lots of interesting info and
routines for Revelation including  some undocumented
features. Anyway because of our enthusiasm for the product 
and the support we began to show it to many of our clients
who in turn wanted  to order it and have us develope
applications for them. Thus, we have taken a  new direction
with Revelation and actually sell it as well now. Our price
for  FIDONET Members is $735.00 plus shipping which is
$215.00 dollars off list.  Revelation also supports the 8087
chip (not required ) which we sell for  $100.00. We also
have provided training/education in addition to software 
development for many clients.   The current Revelation
version is release F. Version G in beta-test now will 
operate on LAN's  using NOVELL NETWARE software.Which is the
best of its kind. Also a new single user version is due out
in April which will have lots of new  features.
Incidentally,Elf also markets Utility disks which contain
programs  to enhance Revelation. You can also interface
Assembly language routines to  Revelation.  I find the
documentation very thorough and easy to read. There are a
few  typos here and there but doc files on disk clear those

up. The manual is  divided into several sections
Tutorials,Revelation commands,Rdesign,Text  editors ,RNET
and Rbasic. The tutorials correspond to sample database
files  provided on disk. Also several samples Rbasic
programs are provided.  Revelation itself IS NOT COPY
PROTECTED IN ANY WAY another great selling  point .  Average
learning time?? I would say this depends upon the scope of
the  applications you are developing. You can use Revelation
within hours by  following the menus. If you are developing
complicated applications and need  to use the actual
programming language itself learning time will depend upon 
the depth of database/programming knowledge the developer
has. 

 I hope this Tip of the iceberg look gives you some
conception of the  capabilities Revelation has. If you
require any assistance ,further  information, etc. don't
hesitate to contact me.

 INTRODUCTION :                 

 These are the on-going adventures of The WANGMASTER.  His
five year  mission, to seek out and educate naive young
women, to explore strange  new positions, to boldly do what
no man has done before : find desirable MTV's Martha Quinn !

 Once a shy and retiring 132 pound weakling in the hills of
Maryland,  Wang was inexorably drawn a few years ago to the
fast lane in too cool  California, where fate led him to
that famous Tasmanian Guru, Swami  Buster Rajneesh Horsedong
Hyman.  This great guru took little Wang under his tutelage
and taught him the ways of Wangmastery, blessing him with
the Holy Oyster of Hugerodduperdam, before returning to his

native land. Wang's duty :  to educate as many women as
possible and spread the Word of the Swami from the desert to
the sea to all of southern California in preparation for the
Coming :  the day when Buster would move his Promiscuous
Practice from Tasmania to So. Cal.  The rest is history.
Today, Wang is a 132 pounds of irresistable manhood : 
Allistair Cooke wrapped in a Tom Selleck body with a dash of
Woody Allen thrown in for vulnerability and sensitivity.  He
is the James Dean of jacuzzis.

        As a matter of brief introduction, I am Bill
Macneill, SYSOP of FIDO node #202 in Boston, Massachusetts
(1-617-721-1688).

        Recently, one of the members of my Board (DEC-Line
-- a DEC Micro oriented board) uploaded a game file known as
JETSET.BAS...a jet plane simulator, and one of the great
classic public domain games. The problem with JETSET,
however, is that it is SOOOOOOO SLOWWWWWWW! 

        I would very much like the readers of this
newsletter to advise me as to whether JETSET has been
compiled to operate directly as an 'executable' under the
MSDOS operating environment. If one of you is familiar with
such a file, please advise me where I can obtain a copy...or
even better, why don't you just call and upload to DEC-
Line??  Again, we are at 1-617-721-1688 in Boston....
