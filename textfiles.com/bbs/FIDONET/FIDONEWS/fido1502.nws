     ZEC1 Election still going strong. More answers from candidates appear
     below.

     An odd argument in the FIDONEWS Echo about uuencoded traffic in
     Echomail. No articles were forthcoming from the fracas, however,
     proving once again that Echomail is cheap. [snicker]

     The Super Bowl teams are set and none of my predictions made it. With
     100% prediction for the World Series and 0% for the Super Bowl, I've
     got an even 50% average for major league sports. Hmmm, sounds like
     random chance after all.

     1998 is proceeding without an International Coordinator and this
     week's Nodelist in Zone 1 had the Day 346 update from Zone 2. [sigh]

     Yep. Pretty much the same old stuff.

     Pursuant to our earlier conversation, would you post this where it
     will do the most good?  Feel free to modify it if you wish.  Add your
     name as a co-moderator.  Thanks.  Oh, yes.  My BBS closed down.  I am
     using another finally.

     The Fidonet echo called Church&State is on the Backbone and available
     to Fidonet nodes without extra charge.

     This is a topic which has increasing importance because of the
     political activity of the Religious Right.  The relationship between
     church and state may be one of the most significant issues of the
     decade.  Some authorities claim that nearly half of the state
     Republican organizations are now controlled by the Christian
     Coalition.

     There is much debate about whether the First Amendment needs to be
     revised.  Are Christians actually being "persecuted" in the United
     States today?  Or are Christians expecting too much when they want to
     post the Ten Commandments in government buildings and schools?  Will
     our nation abandon the principle of "no tax for religion" and provide
     funding for religious schools?  Would government control follow?

     Should government welfare funds be distributed through sectarian
     institutions without restricting proselyting?  What would a "parental
     rights" bill accomplish?  Are people of some minority religions unfit
     to hold public office?  Should schools allow students to decide on a
     majority basis whether prayers are said at graduation?  What happens
     to the rights of the minority then - are they ostracized?

     There are many more issues which come under the topic.  They involve
     both religious liberty and establishments of religion.

     Church&State is a moderated echo, and participants are requested to
     avoid lengthy theological discussions and stick to the relationships
     which should exist between religious groups and government.

     Please help provide an opportunity for people to air discussion on

     such significant issues.  Obtain church&State and mention it to users.

     Departure of a Friend
     Damian Walker, 2:2502/666

     On Thursday 8th January, a region 25 sysop, Cliff Harrold, passed away
     suddenly.  This unexpected news has been a great shock to quite a
     number of people.  I didn't know Cliff that well, I've never met him
     fact to face, but I worked with him quite a lot via netmail and most
     certainly consider him as a friend.  Let me tell you about Cliff now.

     Cliff was our REC, a position which in many European regions is more
     akin the ZEC or OBO elsewhere.  As REC he was hard-working and
     approachable, and he will be sorely missed by many people here.

     Cliff became well known some years ago when he started running the
     Coracle Midnight Line, making use of a special scheme available in the
     UK for unmetered long-distance calls to allow cheap transport of
     echomail around the country.  Cliff's system moved much of the
     country's echomail, and continues to do so for the time being, thanks
     to the kind efforts of his family, for whom messing about with
     computers is probably one of the last things they want to be doing
     right now.

     Some time after establishing his midnight line, Cliff became elected
     as the region's REC when Dave Gorski stepped down.  In that time,
     Cliff has worked extensively to maintain and re-organise the region 25
     backbone.  One thing which gave the region's backbone a particular
     boost was his willingness to take on new echoes quickly, without the
     need for a minimum amount of traffic or any existing distribution.
     While this occasionally resulted in a few stillborn echoes on the
     backbone, it did make Fidonet seem more open and friendly to sysops
     and users, new and old alike, and has allowed a large number of
     worthwhile echoes to be created which might otherwise have required
     too much effort for their creators.

     We also have to thank him for taking an active and supportive role in
     such things as moderator elections and NEC appointments, and for
     helping resolve disputes in echomail and elsewhere (whether successful
     or not).  On the political side of things, Cliff created a set of
     recommended moderator election rules which, while never forced on a
     returning officer, were extremely helpful and saved time for many a RO
     who would otherwise have had to devise his or her own rules.  He also
     organised a team of people to try and create a regional echomail
     policy to replace the rather unsuitable Echopol 1, which is all we
     have at the moment; work on this is still in progress, and as a member
     of Cliff's team I fully intend to see it through, whether it gets
     accepted in the end or not.

     FIDONEWS 15-02               Page 4                   12 Jan 1998


     In the tribute which our RC, Keith Wassell, thoughtfully wrote and
     posted, he asks that at least for now, "let us not argue about silly
     things, over moderator elections [...] etc." and with this I concur.
     In fact I would go even further.

     You always hear about what good someone has done, whether it's
     anything to do with Fidonet or not, after they're gone.  What a shame
     it is that Cliff isn't here to enjoy the recognition he is receiving
     now, and quite rightly deserves.  But why did people wait until now?
     I'm as guilty as anyone else here.

     Perhaps it's time to think about the people who are still working hard
     to ensure that everything in Fidonet is running smoothly.  The people
     who arrange our feeds, the people who look after our echo lists and
     nodelist, the people who devise and maintain our technical standards
     and create the software we use to shift the mail.  Maybe once in a
     while it would be nice if they were given some thanks for their
     trouble, something to brighten up their day and make their efforts
     seem worthwhile.  It sure would make a change from the usual bitching.

     Fidonet belongs to all of us?

     By Bill Whitehouse (1:323/109)

          Four years ago, on Jan. 1, 1994, a dozen Rhode Island sysops
     braved hangovers and sub-zero cold to mount a satellite dish on our
     roof.
          They brought tools, components, enthusiasm, and a marked distaste
     for abusive authority.
          Planet Connect made every subscriber a star. Within a month the
     Radio Free Echomail (RFE) dish was feeding 78 systems in 5 states, for
     free; anyone agreeing to pass along the Fido file and message feed for
     free to their downlinks and callers. We were happy to underwrite the
     daily mail and file dish feed. Others were always eager to help. Five
     sysops took turns managing the entire message bone. Our file echo
     thrived.
          The only thing that made any of it possible was trust; trust that
     the network's coordinators would do as they promised, trust that they
     wouldn't pretend an election took place when no one voted, trust they
     wouldn't intentionally limit participation, trust they wouldn't hack
     sysop message traffic, trust that the Zone Coordinator would actually
     give a damn.

          That trust is gone.

          Abusive arrogance on this scale makes coordinators capable of any
     rotten thing. And no one wants to play this game anymore. The region's
     nodelist hemorrhage reflects that fact. Fido as a whole lost 32.8
     percent these last two years. New England, over the same period,
     shrank 59.8 percent.
          Our current PC subscription expires January 24, 1998.
          We're taking it all down -- the dish, the feed, the node number.
          We know, and regret, that this will prompt other sysops to
     dismantle their own systems.

          Fidonet is a great idea, but only when it belongs to all of us.
     Thanks for the good times. There were some.

     The Z1EC Election (more candidate questionnaires)
     by Lisa Gronke, 1:105/16
     lisa@psg.com

     Continuing last week's article, here are the completed questionnaires
     from Jeff Smith and Bob Kohl. As I write this, I don't have a
     questionnaire from Wayne Delisle Sr., but he's been out of touch
     because his uplink, 1:12/12, was knocked out by the icestorm in the
     northeast (USA & Canada). His questionnaire may come in before
     FidoNews goes to press; if not, look for it next week.

     Gary Gilmore has withdrawn as a candidate.

     In addition to those I mentioned last week, John Roberts [1:385/1000]
     & David Whitaker [1:282/1050] have submitted interesting lists of
     questions to the candidates and may be compiling the replies.


     Message #2380 "Z1_ELECTION"
     Date: 06-Jan-98 02:57
     From: Jeff Smith
     To:   All
     Subj: Questionnaire

     Hello All!

     1> What are your qualifications? What FTN positions have you held?

               Well... I have been a echomail hub since I joined Fidonet
     and have been both NEC and now NC as well as a regional hub. I am
     interested in the future of Fidonet and want to help it change the
     tide that it has seen of late. I am not very politically minded
     which... I don't look at as a bad thing. The art of politicking has
     never impressed me much and I think Fidonet can do better with less in
     that regard.

     2> If elected Z1EC, would you continue with other currently held FTN
     2> positions?

             If elected ZEC I would call for an election for the position
     of NC that I currently hold. I would also find a replacement for me as
     moderator of Z1_BACKBONE as I would not want there to be any possible
     conflict of interest.

     3> Do you foresee any problems with the list of duties for the ZEC
     3> position?

              Not at this point.
     FIDONEWS 15-02               Page 6                   12 Jan 1998


     3> Which of those functions do you consider most important?

              One thing that I feel that need work is in the area of
     mediation between moderators and the different distribution systems.
     Times are a changing and I foresee work needing to be done in this
     area. Also mediation or maybe coordination is a better term between
     the other ZEC's.

     4> How do you feel about Echomail Policy?

              I think there needs to be some form of policy. But.. I at the
     same time think it is important not to go overboard in this regard.
     Some policy will be good. Too much policy could be worse than none at
     all.

     5> Are there any functions not listed in the job description that you
     5> think are important?

              At the present time, no.

     6> Do you anticipate any problems working with the Z1C, the RECs, the
     6> EchoList Coordinator, or those who run the major and minor
     6> distribution systems?

              None that I think can't be worked out.

     7> What do you think the major echomail problems in the next two
     7> years will be?

              The biggest change for Fidonet has been the impact that the
     internet has had. I think it is important the we learn to use what the
     internet has to offer us instead of trying to compete with it. We will
     need to make some changes in the way we do things to make life easier.
     Also I think that the work the FTSC is doing is a good thing as we
     need technical standards that take into account the technology we have
     today. In this regard we are behind the times and need to do some
     catching up.

     8> With a two year term, Jan 1, 2000 comes on your watch. What role
     8> do you see for the Z1EC at that time?

              Ahh... If you are talking about the anticipated computer
     problem with the year 2000. I don't think it will have a large impact
     on Fidonet. The government, the IRS, and the SSA might be a different
     story. <g>

     9> Any other comments?

             Not right now.

     > 1998 Z1EC ELECTION -- CANDIDATE QUESTIONNAIRE
     > --------------------------------------------------
     > 1. What are your qualifications? What FTN positions have you held?

     I've been a sysop for over ten years. During this time I've been a
     moderator since roughly about 8-12 months or so after the first echo
     area was split into several.

     I've been a hub.

     I've been an NEC for 2-3 years.

     An REC for 3 years.

     An RC for over 2 years during which reg 10 was revived from a 2-3 year
     period of neglect.

     My commitment to Fidonet over the years has been extensive.


     > 2. If elected Z1EC, would you continue with other currently held
     >    FTN positions?

     Yes for two reason.

     First I honor my commitments and I've made a commitment to carry on as
     RC10. The last commitment I made to anyone was to myself about getting
     this election going.

     More important then this, I see having access to the ZC and the RCC as
     crucial to the process of bringing an echopol to completion. I have an
     established relationship with the ZC that can be used constrictively
     for this purpose.

     I am well aware of P4 on this issue, however the precedent of wearing
     more then one hat was established *long* ago and there are now many
     examples of this given the continued shrinking of resources within
     Zone 1. George Peace is also an example of this. Both RC and REC
     responsibilities have been well maintained during my watch.


     > 3. Do you foresee any problems with the list of duties for the ZEC
     >    position?

     I wrote it with the help of the RECC and all the sysops that cared to
     contribute, I see no problems with it. The key to the list of ZEC
     duties is echopol and this has always been on the duty list since the
     first draft. My thanks to Jim McLaughlin for the input on the first
     draft.

     > Which of those functions do you consider most important?

     Echopol and making sure we have a set of active REC's to represent
     their respective regions, to take information to and bring back the
     input from the sysops of their regions.


     > 4. How do you feel about Echomail Policy?

     About time isn't it? :)


     > 5. Are there any functions not listed in the job description that
     >    you think are important?

     For a ZEC to be truly functional I think experience as well as a good
     working knowledge of how things currently work is going to prove
     crucial for the next ZEC. He'll be able to take on the position
     without a lag, instead of trying to "catching up" on how things work.
     In simple terms: Hit the ground running.

     We've had discussions here on P4 issues that have little to do with
     the ZEC. We have people discussing "appeals" for echomail problems
     that do not exist since the "vote with your feet" approach was put
     into effect in Z1. The appeals process for echomail posters has been
     discussed at length and *repeatedly* over the years by the moderators
     and *EC's. To date no better answer process has come to light and I
     support it.

     It's rare that the *C's seriously review any PC based on echomail
     issues. The RECC does not review moderator complaints or at least
     hasn't in the three years I've been an REC.

     If a candidate doesn't have the knowledge and/or experience, it's
     going to inhibit the constructive process which is problematical
     considering the amount of time it will take to sort out an echopol.
     More then that, an inexperienced ZEC will have to learn how to work
     with the RECC after what's gone on for the past few years.

     Given this, as ZEC I would actively moderate the RECC echo so that
     events that have transpired do not occur again. This would help keep
     the RECC productive in the future as they have been recently regarding
     this election and I view this as a VERY important function.

     As ZEC I would also appoint a "web" coordinator to help link all the
     Zone 1 sites together as well as help those that do not have sites.
     In reg 10, we've had some very positive results from our web sites. I
     see this as an important function for promoting Fidonet. I realize
     that some efforts have been made on this issue, but I'd like to see
     this brought to fruition in a coordinated effort.

     Nope, I've worked with Bob Satti for over two years in a constructive
     manner and amongst other things have helped return some of the user
     flags to the nodelist. I think this relationship will prove to be
     crucial working towards the establishment of an echopol as well as a
     common set of flags for echomail "hubs" for the nodelist.

     As far as working with the RECC, we have the election that wasn't
     going to happen going on right now don't we? ;)

     Subject: Stepping down as candidate

     Hello all,

     What with the new year, the work schedule for me has become more
     clear. Between what's booked into the Detroit Opera House (my main
     gig), as well as other stagehand work coming into town, I'll be rather
     busy.

     Because of this, I will not only -not- have the time to properly
     campaign, but more importantly, not have the time to really devote
     myself to the job of Z1EC in the beginning of the term, which will be
     the most crucial time for the new Z1EC, IMHO. :-/  (Sure, I would have
     time as things settle down, but again, not in the beginning, and that
     wouldn't be fair to those in Fidonet that would have me serve as
     Z1EC.)

     While I know I -can- do the job, I just wouldn't be doing it very well
     with the requirements on my time that work is going to take.  Average
     opera load-ins last a week or more of 8am to midnight, and when I get
     home, I'm lucky to have enough energy to just skim for "hot" mail, let
     alone get really involved in any major situations.  (And there's talk
     of a rock tour for me in the summer, but I'll have to see how that
     pans out.)

     Because of all this, I'm feel I have no alternative but to remove

     myself from the list of candidates. Yes, maybe I will find I have more
     free time than I expect, but I don't want to take the chance.  We're I
     elected and becoming an "absentee ZEC" due to work, I'd receive all
     sorts of hell for that. No thanks. (And I don't think Fidonet deserves
     that either.)

     As of this message, I am no longer a candidate for Z1EC.

     For those that were going to vote for me, I suggest an alternative.
     After reading much of what has been said here and in other echos, I
     personally feel Bob Kohl would make a good Z1EC. He knows echomail,
     knows Fidonet, and I feel would be able to "cut through the crap" of
     the polarization that's occurred in the recent past with echomail.
     (Not to mention the fact he is more experienced than the other
     candidates, nor is too involved in "othernets" like some candidates.)
     I don't feel that he'd be a "more of the same" Z1EC, and I hope those
     who supported me will now support him. (Though your choice is, of
     course, up to you.)

     Thank you, and good luck to all the candidates in this election.
