       For those who did not identify President Reagan's moving poetic
       closing literary allusion, the following original text of the
       WWII flier's piece will be appropriate:

            "Oh, I have slipped the surly bonds of Earth
            And danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings;
            Sunward I've climbed, and joined the tumbling mirth
            Of sun-split clouds ... and done a hundred things
            You have not dreamed of ... wheeled and soared and swung
            High in sunlit silence. Hov'ring there,
            I've chased the shouting wind along, and flung
            My eager craft through footless halls of air ...
            Up, up the long, delirious, burning blue
            I've topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace,
            Where never lark, or even eagle flew ...
            And, while with silent, lifting mind I've trod
            The high untrespassed sanctity of space,
            Put out my hand and touched the face of God."

       What could be a better tribute, and memorial, to those who
       died in Space?

                              The Bear's Den

       On  January 28,  1986,  at 11:39 am,  our world was  rocked.
       Once again,  we will all remember exactly what we were doing
       when  we heard the news.   The shock,  disbelief,  pain  and
       sorrow  were felt across the country and the world.   A  lot
       more than seven lives were lost in  those microseconds  when
       the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded.  Along with the death
       of the seven astronauts, a  little of America and the  world
       died.  In grief, pain  and  frustration,  I decided  to  try
       to do something to make myself feel a little better.

       I  setup a new editorial on both of my FIDOs,  expressing my
       feelings,  and  asking  the user population to  share  their
       views in a new message area.   In addition, I decided that I
       would  collect  these  messages,  and try to  take  them  to
       Senator Jake Garn's office,  to show that there was  support
       for  the  space  shuttle program from a sector that  is  not
       usually heard from,  the BBS community.   I also issued  the
       same request via UUCP/USENET to the UNIX community.  And the
       messages  have been pouring in.   I have been in touch  with
       Senator  Garn's office,  and they are very interested in the
       effort.

       So again I ask,  to the SYSOPs and users of FIDONET.  Please
       collect messages from your users, expressing their reactions
       to the shuttle tragedy,  and their opinions as to the future
       of  the manned space program.   After a week or  so,  bundle
       them up into an archive and send them to me via FIDONET.   I
       will collect them,  print them out,  and hand carry them  to
       Senator Garn, on behalf of all of us in FIDONET.

       We  need to express our opinions and make them known to  the
       right  people.   If we don't,  someone else is going to make
       the decisions without our input.   And if the wrong decision
       is made,  a lot is going to be lost,  to us,  and to  future
       generations.   I have received responses from as far away as
       Sidney Australia.  Please help keep the program going.

                   Encryption, Public Keys and Otherwise

       PART One.

           If you know what "Public Key Encryption"  is  then  feel
       free to skip to part two.

           Public  Key  Encryption  is a special form of encryption
       which uses different keys for encryption (or scrambling)  of
       a   message   and  decryption  (unscrambling,   the  reverse
       operation).

           The  separate  keys  for  each  operation  have  several
       advantages.  The  first  is  that  the encryption key can be
       distributed much more easily by less  secure  means  without
       compromising  the  security  of  future  encrypted messages.
       Simple knowledge of  the  encryption  key  does  not  enable
       decryption  of  encrypted  messages.  The  decryption key is
       required to recreate the original message.  For this  reason
       the  encryption  key is commonly called the "public key" and
       the decryption key is the "private key".

           In operation,  everyone  who  wants  to  receive  secret
       messages creates their own pair of keys, one private and one
       public.  The public key is them communicated to everyone who
       may want to send them a secret message.  Perhaps  a  central
       key  distribution  center could be established.  The private
       key is kept secret and never told to anyone.

           For example ... Art wants to send Beth a secret message.
       He would look up Beth's public key or ask her  to  send  him
       one  (in the clear).  He would then use Beth's public key to
       encrypt his message and send her the encrypted message. Beth
       receives the message and decodes it with her private key. No
       one else can decrypt the message even if they get a copy  of
       the  encrypted  message  AND  the public key.  They need the
       private key.

           In 1978 the CACM journal published a way of  doing  this
       on computers. The system they described has come to be known
       as the "RSA" cypto system.

           The  RSA  system  has  an additional property beyond the
       general Public Key Encryption system described so far.  With
       the RSA system the keys are interchangeable so you can use a
       private   key  to  encrypt  a  message  and  then  only  the
       corresponding public key will unscramble the  message.  This
       is  in  effect a "digital signature" which "signs" a message
       showing that the encrypted  message  could  only  have  been
       created with knowledge of the private key.

           Messages  can  also  be  encrypted  more than once.  For
       example you can sign a message with  your  private  key  and
       then  encrypt  the result again with the intended receiver's
       public key to make a signed,  secret message.  The  receiver
       would  then  need to do the reverse two steps in the reverse
       order to get the original message back.

           Even more complex interaction can be  used  for  special
       purposes.  Articles  have appeared on how to play poker over
       the phone and how to hold a secret ballot election over  the
       phone and others.


       PART Two.

           I have recently completed a Public Key Encryption system
       based  on the RSA system.  It runs on MS-DOS using files for
       keys  and  messages.   I  am  distributing  the  system   as
       freeware/shareware. (PKSCrypt 0.0 or 0.01)

           There  may  be some legal or political considerations in
       this.

           I have heard rumors that this sort of stuff comes  under
       certain  restrictions for export of high tech (or something)
       from the USA. I don't think this quite applies to me because
       I am exporting the system TO the USA. (I live in Canada).

           I  have  also  heard  rumors  that   some   intelligence
       organization  (unnamed)  is  discouraging  public discussion
       (let alone utilization) of these  systems.  I  have  trouble
       believing  this  because  I  had  no trouble finding all the
       information I could ever desire on the  subject.  There  was
       even  an  article in Byte magazine and a couple of follow-up
       letters.

           Anyone who has any solid info on this,  I would like  to
       hear from you. I especially would like to hear directly from
       any  government  organization(s)  (in  any  country) who may
       think they are involved.


       Interested parties may contact me via Fido node 134/1.

       "What's a Fidogram?" Aw,  c'mon now!  Dontcha read your Fido
       newsletters?  OK,  for  all of you who've been chasing bytes
       in Katmandu of late, here's the scoop.

       The Fidogram service is a free telegram  service.  Yessiree,
       just  like  Western  Onion;  you  send us the complete name,
       address and telephone number of the person you want to  send
       the  Fidogram  to.  You also provide the text and signature,
       of course.  Finally,  you provide the senders complete name,
       address  and  Phone  number.  This is necessary in the event
       that the Fidogram can't be delivered;  no point  in  forcing
       the  volunteer  Amateur  Radio  Operators  to spend money on
       Fidomail back to you just because you forgot to include some
       necessary information.  If you include the senders info,  we
       can send Fidograms for free...

       No  Fidograms are accepted that relate in any way to anybody
       making money.  No profit by Fidograms, period.  Also,  don't
       try sending Fidograms that include a lot of numerical data -
       these   messages   are   relayed  by  volunteers  who  don't
       necessarily know anything about computers,  baud  rates,  or
       even Fido (strange as it may seem!)

       Fido  Sysops  that  are located on or near college campuses,
       take note!  Fidograms don't have  to  come  from  just  Fido
       users - this service can easily be advertised in cafeterias,
       dorms,  and  on bulletin boards - (you remember the old kind
       of bulletin boards, right?)

       Be sure to send time-value  Fidograms  in  plenty  of  time.
       Three  to  four days seems about right to most larger cities
       in the USA.  If you're planning  on  originating  a  hundred
       Valentines Day Fidograms, send 'em extra early

       Feel  free  to use and enjoy the free Fidogram service.  For
       more info,  call Cape Cod Fido at 617-255-9465 and  download
       the Fidogram file.  Oh ya,  by the way,  NO, we DON'T accept
       "Happy VD" Fidograms for Valentines Day!

                          Don't Miss Those Calls!


       How  many of you have taken the telephone off the hook to do
       Fido maintenance, and then restarted FIDO... Two hours later
       you notice the telephone is still off the  hook.  No  wonder
       Fido was so quiet!

       After  doing  this  one  time  too  many  I  figured  out an
       automated way  of  busying  the  phone,  so  that  it  would
       automatically  go  busy when Fido went down,  and reset when
       Fido was restarted.

       Assuming you have a "Hayes Compatible" modem, here's how you
       do it in BASIC:

           10 OPEN "COM1:1200,N,8,,CS,DS,CD" AS #1
           20 PRINT #1, "AT M0 C0 S7=1800 H1"
           30 '
           40 PRINT "* COM1 Telephone Line now OFF Hook *"
           50 '
           60 'M0 = no speaker       H1 = Offhook
           70 'C0 = no carrier       S7 = # of sec to pick up phone
           80 '
           90 CLOSE #1
           100 SYSTEM

       If your modem won't handle 1200 baud,  change the '1200'  in
       line 10 to whatever your modem will handle.  Your phone LINE
       is now off the hook, but your TELEPHONE isn't.

       When you are ready to run Fido  again,  simply  execute  the
       following:

           10 OPEN "COM1:1200,N,8,,CS,DS,CD" AS #1
           20 PRINT #1, "ATZ"
           30 '
           40 PRINT "* COM1 Telephone Line Now RESET *"
           50 '
           60 CLOSE #1
           70 SYSTEM

       The above resets the Modem, and FIDO can initialize it as it
       wants.

       Now,  to  really make this system automatic,  I've added the
       execution to my RUNBBS.BAT  file.  Just  before  FIDO_IBM  I
       execute  OFFHOOK,  as  I call it,  and just after FIDO_IBM I
       execute RSETCOM1.  It's that simple and I can't forget.

       Every time I run the FIDO .BAT file the modem is reset,  and
       FIDO starts up.  When FIDO comes down  for  whatever  reason
       (CTRL-C,  External  events,  whatever),  the  modem goes off
       hook, so callers will get a busy.

       I've been using  this  for  several  months  now  without  a
       problem and thought I'd share my laziness with others!

                        FidoNet Mail Help (A Plea)

                                    by
                                Bob Hartman
                            Sysop Fido 132/101
                             The UN*X Gateway
                           and Home of Rovermsg



               As  everyone  knows,   FidoNet  has  grown   at   an
       incredible  rate  over  the last two years.  This growth has
       caused some problems.  One of those  problems  is  that  the
       amount  of FidoNet mail being sent has also increased.  This
       is a real problem for my node.  I send about 30 messages per
       night to nodes all over the country.  These include personal
       messages from me and my users,  and also messages from users
       on UNIX systems around the world.

       Anyway,  to  get  to  the point.  The one hour national mail
       slot is simply no longer long enough!  Many messages spend a
       few days to a couple of weeks on  my  board  waiting  to  be
       forwarded.  In  particular,  it  is  extremely  difficult to
       connect to nets 102,  101,  or 107.  Since  these  are  very
       large nets, that is not surprising.

       Now that I have pointed out the problem (which everyone knew
       existed  anyway),  the  question  is what to do about it.  I
       would like to ask every network coordinator to send to me  a
       list  of times when he/she runs a FidoNet schedule,  and can
       receive mail.  I would also like to know if that schedule is
       run by all of the nodes in the network.

       If every network could send that information to me,  I could
       create a larger number of FidoNet schedules,  and attempt to
       call some nodes during the non-national mail times.  This is
       an extremely important question to be addressed for my node.
       The extra messages  that  simply  sit  in  my  message  area
       waiting  to be forwarded take up valuable processing time at
       the start and end of  my  FidoNet  schedules.  This  finally
       came  to  a  peak  last  Tuesday when my board was trying to
       process 118 FidoNet messages.  It took 40 minutes to  create
       all  the  packets,  and then it could only try about 4 phone
       calls in the remaining time!  This causes a real  bottleneck
       at my end, but with your help it can be stopped.

       The  reason  that  I  am placing this in the Fidonews rather
       than requesting it via FidoNet mail should be obvious!!!

       DataFlex BBS
       714-675-7106 3/12/2400 baud

       Due to a lack of interest in the current theme  of  my  BBS,
       the  DataFlex  RDBMS  Application  Development System,  I am
       considering changing the main driving force of the board  to
       a Fido Sysop's Board.  Therefore,  I would like to conduct a
       poll to determine how much interest there would be  to  such
       an  undertaking,  which,  admittedly,  will be one humongous
       job.

       Basically,  it will be a restricted access system with regis-
       tration  and  questionnaire  required  as  a prerequisite of
       password validation.  Verifiable Fido Sysops will  be  given
       privileged  access  to all Sysop-related areas,  others will
       have access only to the general message base and  the  exten-
       sive  collection  of  IBM  and compatible public domain soft-
       ware,  which at this time consists of over 15  megabytes  of
       software and other types of files, all in ARC format.

       The board does support 2400 baud access, and is currently up
       most of the 24 hours (and sometimes more) hours in a day.

       This  Sysop  is  an  independent consultant currently on con-
       tract to Rockwell International's Collins Defense  Communica-
       tions  division.  I have been a programmer for over 10 years
       and also spent 4 years in the Marine Corps  as  an  Avionics
       Technician.

       The board itself has been up since last summer.

       The  subjects  to be covered by the board will be many,  but
       will be obviously left  to  the  users  themselves.  I  will
       attempt  to  provide  some direction,  but,  considering the
       quite large number of Fido Sysops today,  I don't think that
       will be a problem.

       If  you  are  interested  in this and would like to see this
       project become a reality, PLEASE SEND A FIDONET MAIL MESSAGE
       STATING SO!!  I really want to do this but won't if there is
       no interest.  No point wasting time on a project that  might
       not  get off the ground,  considering how much time it takes
       to set up something like this.

       Send your vote to Fido 102/511.  I just changed my  Net/Node
       number  to  join my local region,  so I might not be on your
       current nodelist.  If this is the case,  add  the  following
       line to your nodelist in the Net 102 section:

       ,611,DataFlex_BBS,Balboa_CA,Juan_Jimenez,1-714-675-7106,2400

       Thank  you  in  advance for taking the time to send out your
       vote.

                                  TROFF 2
                        by Rich Gough   FIDO 129/13

       (The reaction of the Pittsburgh Area  Computer  Club  to  my
       TROFF story was so positive,  that I wrote a sequel 6 months
       later, May 1983.  At the 1984 Computerfest in Dayton, Ohio I
       found out that  these  2  articles  had  been  reprinted  in
       computer  club newsletters all over the Midwest,  and that a
       third story had been written using the same  characters  and
       setting.  I DIDN'T WRITE IT.  I'd like to see it,  if any of
       you remember it,  I'd appreciate someone sending me  a  copy
       via FidoMail or just submit it to the Fidonews.)


       One night a few months ago,  something very strange happened
       to me while I was using my home computer.  I was  trying  to
       load  the  operating system,  and I meant to type "LOAD CPM"
       but I typed "LOAD MCP" instead.  Before I knew it, I found I
       was  being  sucked  into  the  computer  through  the  video
       display!  I  woke  up  in strange world where home computers
       are computers that  work  at  home,  as  opposed  to  office
       computers who commute.

       I  had  found  myself  at a computer club meeting,  which is
       where a bunch of computers  get  together  every  month,  it
       seemed to me,  mostly to gripe about the people they own.  I
       heard two or three get specific -- that they were  overused,
       underused,  or ignored altogether,  due to their poor choice
       of user (what they call the people they own.) I was about to
       give them a bit of my mind when  I  crashed  back  here  (to
       reality?)

       It  has  been hard for me to believe what happened,  and the
       one friend I confided in thought someone had spiked my pain-
       reliever tablets.  I knew the only way to know for sure that
       I had been there was to go back.  I plugged in an  appliance
       timer which would shut off the power and crash the system in
       2 hours, to make sure I got out, and turned the computer on.
       I  carefully  loaded  the same diskette as before and took a
       deep breath as I typed "M...C...P".  I exhaled when  nothing
       happened.  It must have been a dream.

       I realized that my diskette drive  hadn't  made  it's  usual
       clattering  noise  -- probably a loose connection.  I tapped
       it lightly with my fingernail.  My finger disappeared,  then
       my whole hand!  Too late for second thoughts now, I thought,
       as I plunged through the CRT.

       This  time  I  landed on my head,  on the silicon floor of a
       round lobby.  Fortunately,  all of the computers in the room
       were  so  engrossed  in  technical conversation that none of
       them noticed my arrival.  I started  to  go  into  the  main
       meeting  room,  but  I  was  stopped  by pudgy grey computer
       wearing tinted glasses.

       "Hi!" he said. "Welcome to the meeting.  Are you a member or
       a visitor?"



       Fidonews                   Page 11                3 Feb 1986





       "This is my second time here.  Excuse me,  are those glasses
       you're wearing?"

       "Oh these filters?  I get tube-strain when I stare at a user
       for too long at a time.  Would you like to join the club?"

       I  thought  about  it.  I got here twice,  and I may make it
       back twice,  and it's certainly a neat place.  I may have  a
       hard time getting past this fellow if I don't join.  "Sure,"
       I said.

       "Good,  just fill out this form" he said  and  handed  me  a
       formatted diskette.

       He  still  doesn't realize I'm just a user.  He thinks I'm a
       computer!  I'll have to act like one.

       "Ah,  er excuse me.  I'm sort of an  inexpensive  system.  I
       don't  have a diskette drive yet.  Can I fill out a cassette
       and mail it to you?"

       The grey system found  a  tattered  printout.  "Sure.  Here,
       show  this  to your user and answer the questions.  Oh,  and
       include the fee, 112 bits."

       I did some mental arithmatic.  2 bits to a quarter, that's 8
       bits  to  the  dollar,   that  makes  14  dollars.   What  a
       coincidence!  Just what it costs in the "real" world.

       "And what name should I put on your tag?" he said.

       "Ahhhhhhh" I said.

       He looked puzzled.

       "RIC. That's it, my name is RIC-20."

       "Great.  Always nice to see  new  systems.  There  are  some
       other  RICs over in the corner.  I think they are discussing
       the best way to teach BASIC to their users.  They  may  even
       get together a class."

       I  went  into  the meeting room and got a cup of programming
       fluid (we would call it coffee.)  I  noticed  that  all  the
       computers  were careful not to spill it down their keyboard.
       I started mingling.

       A keypad tapped me on the shoulder.  I turned around  see  a
       middle-aged system in a one-piece beige case,  with a little
       round rainbow-striped logo above one side  of  his  keyboard
       (sort of like the alligator on an Izod shirt).

       "Excuse  me,  RIC,  didn't I see you here a couple of months
       ago?"

       "You might have.  Could you tell me  what  happened  to  the
       three systems that did most of the talking?"



       Fidonews                   Page 12                3 Feb 1986





       "Well",  the  beige-cased  computer said "the video game got
       the teenage user he wanted and  now  he's  so  busy  playing
       games  he  doesn't bother to come to the club meetings.  The
       16-bit system got a multi-tasking operating  system,  so  he
       was able to acquire a second user.  The second user likes to
       use graphics,  so he isn't bored anymore.  The 16-bit system
       even gets his users to send electronic mail to each other!"

       "What happened to the machine that complained he  was  never
       used?" I said.

       "It  was too bad.  He had to sell his user at a big loss.  I
       think it will be a long time before he buys another one."

       "Gee,  I'm sorry to hear that.  I guess that's just the  way
       the  chips  fall sometimes." I looked at my watch.  The main
       meeting would start soon.

       "Say,  have you heard who the speaker today is going to be?"
       the beige system asked.

       I  looked  at  the newsletter I had picked up on the way in.
       It's hard for me to read hexidecimal,  but I managed to pick
       out  the headline.  "Some professor from C.P.U.  is going to
       speak  on  a  project  there,   Natural   Intelligence   and
       Humantics."

       "Waste  of  time"  the beige computer spat.  "The user never
       breathed who had an ounce of real intelligence,  and they're
       wasting millions of bits proving it."

       I  smiled  at  him  and said "Oh,  I think there a few users
       around here who might surprise you."

                          THE WORLD OF COMPUTING
                        written by Reuven M. Lerner
                              FidoMail 107/33


          Hi!   Welcome  to the World of Computing.  This is going
       to be a mish-mash of  news,  ideas,  Fido  happenings,  and
       computer-related  things.   "The  World  of  Computing" is,
       admittedly, a strange name for a column, but  until  I  get
       any ideas, that's what it's going to be.

          First  of all, let me introduce myself.  I've been using
       computers for about six years now, from Apples to IBM's  to
       DEC's  (I'm  writing  this on an old DEC VT180, my favorite
       machine).  In that time, I've taught a few computer classes
       at my school, written columns and articles  for  my  school
       newspaper  and Fido (see December 23, 1985), and some other
       stuff besides.I programmed in BASIC and Logo, and  for  the
       past  few months, I've used Turbo Pascal.  Some day, I hope
       to go into computer engineering, but we'll take it one step
       at a time.

          So,  back to the column.  I plan on reporting some news,
       talking about it, reviewing a little software and hardware,
       and discussing telecommunications (and  of  course,  Fido).
       I'm  more than open to ideas.  If you want to tell me about
       something, give me a suggestion for a topic, or anything of
       that sort, just write to me at 107/33, addressed to  Reuven
       Lerner, or at 21 Old Westbury Road, Old Westbury, NY 11568.
       I  prefer  electronic  mail, but plain old US (or Canadian)
       mail is just as welcome.

          I'd like to take a quick look back at what  happened  in
       1985,  and  say  what  I  think  will happen in 1986.  I'll
       probably not get to everything, but here it goes.

          1985 was, to say  the  least,  a  busy  year.   Lots  of
       take-overs,  bankruptcies,  new  companies,  and  great new
       software and hardware.

          The biggest news, of course, were the Atari 520  ST  and
       the  Commodore  Amiga.  I've seen and used the ST, and wow!
       What a machine!  The best graphics that I  have  ever  seen
       were  nothing compared to this!  I predict that the ST will
       take over the home market in 1986, slowly but surely.

          So where does that leave the Amiga?  In the same  market
       as   the   Macintosh.   The  Amiga  is,  simply,  a  better
       Macintosh.   It  runs  faster,  it  has   beautiful   color
       graphics,   true   multitasking,   expansion   slots,   and
       everything else that Apple forgot.  Upper-class  users  and
       small  businesses  will  use  the  Amiga,  leaving  the old
       Macintosh in the dust.



       Fidonews                   Page 14                3 Feb 1986





          But the new Macintosh, as written up by InfoWorld, is  a
       different  story.   Watch  out,  Commodore!  Apple's coming
       back with a superMac!  With 800K drives, a bigger keyboard,
       some expansion slots, more memory, and lots more,  this  is
       going to spur some real competition.

          Apple   announced   some   products   this   year,   and
       discontinued some old ones.  First of all,  it  showed  off
       (and  rightly  so)  it's megabyte memory board for the IIe.
       Whatever happened to the shift  to  the  IIc?   Who  knows.
       Anyway,  coupled  with  a  turbo-card,  the IIe is a better
       machine in some ways than the IBM PC!  Apple's hoping  that
       people  will  realize that, when they take into account the
       fact that the new 3.5" Unidisk drive holds 800K, more  than
       twice a 5.25" disk on an IBM.

          Apple also announced the ImageWriter II, a color version
       of the popular ImageWriter.  I wonder if there are going to
       be  any  new  Mac programs that take advantage of the color
       abilities of this machine.  If I  remember  correctly,  the
       Lisa  (remember  that?)  could output color, even though it
       couldn't display it.

          How long has it been since you saw an ad for a Macintosh
       with 128K?  Well, probably about three months, since  Apple
       discontinued it in October.  I wonder why they didn't do it
       sooner.   I  guess  enough  people were fed up with getting
       "Out of memory" errors.

          And what of IBM?  They formally un-announced the PC  II,
       making  even  more noise and speculation about the machine.
       I think they probably have something, and just  don't  want
       to  release  it.  We probably won't see it until late 1986.
       However, the  long-awaited  "Clamshell"  should  be  around
       soon.  I can't believe that IBM is going to take all of the
       competition  from  Data General and Kaypro.  Look for their
       new laptop in the spring or summer.

          So, what's left?  Software, that's what.   There  was  a
       lot  of  new and updated programs this year.  At the top of
       the list was 1-2-3, Symphony, Framework, and other programs
       that  took  advantage  of  the   Lotus/Intel/Microsoft/etc.
       standard  for breaking the 640K barrier.  The software just
       did a lot of memory-juggling, so that you could get about 4
       megabytes from your PC.

          Is it really here?  I can't believe they really did  it!
       Microsoft   finally   came  out  with  Windows,  their  $99
       competitor to TopView and GEM.  I haven't used it yet,  but
       all  of the reviews and information that I have say that it
       is going to blow the competition away.  This is  definitely
       going to be a big winner in 1986.

          Speaking  of  GEM, Digital Research just changed it!  So
       much for their ad campaign  with  beautiful  color  photos;
       they  had  to  scrap  it.  For those of you who don't know,
       Apple threatened a lawsuit  over  the  interface  that  GEM
       used,  stating that it's too close to the Mac.  Some people

       think that Xerox should sue Apple for  taking  THEIR  idea.
       After all, Steve Jobs borrowed the idea from PARC (the Palo
       Alto   Research  Center,  where  the  whole  mouse-graphics
       interface was born).

          Borland  International  came  out  with   SuperKey   and
       Traveling  SideKick this year.  Lucky for them the extended
       memory  specifications  came  out,  or   the   "background"
       programs  would  have  taken  up  all  640K!  Now Traveling
       Software is talking with Borland about using the  Traveling
       name.  I can understand their point, but I highly doubt any
       of  their  business is going to be lost when Borland's logo
       appears in big letters on anything of theirs.

          Another background program, Ready!  arrived from  Living
       Videotext.  I have never used an outline processor, but the
       more  I  think about it, the more I think I need it.  Every
       time I'm writing something, I get an idea, and then by  the
       time I get up to that point in the text, I've forgotten it.
       I'm  getting  an  IBM  compatible  soon...maybe  it's worth
       looking into.  I'm very sure that a lot of people will  get
       Ready!  and will discover how much it's needed.  A definite
       1986 hit.

          News flash: About an hour ago, I read something about  a
       group  of  computer  companies  getting together to discuss
       standards on new computers.  What do I think?   That's  the
       greatest thing that ever happened.  If any of you subscribe
       to  the  New  York  Times, you can read more in the Monday,
       January 6 edition in the Business section.   The  only  bad
       part about this group is that IBM hasn't decided whether or
       not it's going to join.  Come on, IBM!  You can jump on the
       bandwagon for once in your life!

          That about wraps it  up  for  this  issue.   If  I  left
       someone  out,  it's not because I didn't like them, maybe I
       just forgot about them at the moment.

          As I said, I'm probably getting  an  IBM  XT  compatible
       within  a  week  or  two.   Next  time,  I'll  discuss  IBM
       compatibility and its effect on the industry.

          Until next time, happy computing!

                     RIM ELECTRONICS, INC. Announces
              The SASITALK Disk Subsystem/Intelligent Modem

       The RIM ELECTRONICS SASITALK-jr fixed-disk subsystem
       provides a flexible and inexpensive method of adding
       fixed-disk storage to the IBM PCjr, using the industry
       standard Small Computer Systems Interface (SCSI).  The fixed
       disk provides 15MBytes of storage.

       A 300/1200 baud intelligent modem can be added to the host
       adapter board.  Coupled with RIM's version of PROCOMM
       communications software, SASITALK allows the user to
       reliably upload and download using XMODEM, or KERMIT
       protocols, escape to DOS without leaving the session, or run
       as a task under Topview or Windows.

       A SASITALK host adapter is also available for the IBM PC,
       Portable PC, PC-AT, and compatibles.  The SASITALK systems
       enables high performance peripherals to be attached to an
       IBM PC, PCjr, or upgraded versions.

       from:

       It is hard for a romantic person to live in romantic  times.
       The romantic is better off living in practical times,  where
       he can read novels and dream  of  high  adventure.  Romantic
       times call for hard headed practical people to deal with the
       realities and risks of the universe.

       We are at the edge of conquering space itself.  We have left
       footprints  on the Moon,  and we are now making space travel
       an everyday occurrence.  We live in  romantic  times,  where
       the  sky  itself  is no longer the limit.  This is an age of
       practical people who know the risks, and, knowing them, take
       them anyway.

       We have the great privilege,  and the misfortune,  of living
       in an age of heroes.
