                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================


     Hi there. How have you been this week?

     Things have been interesting around here of late. Some of the
     events of the past few weeks seem to merit additional comment,
     in my opinion.

     First and most important of all, I just built a big disk file
     with all the changes I had to make to the Current Versions list.
     I then proceeded to type the wrong command and wrote all over
     the file. If your change isn't there, please send it again.

     Next, I'd like to say that about 70% of the Zone 1 Coordinators
     should resign. If you would like to know which ones I am
     referring to, take the Worldpol roll-call, and delete the ones
     who voted (regardless of their choice). The remaining NC's have
     failed in their mission to represent their net to the rest of
     their Zone and FidoNet at large, and as such need replacement.

     Now I have a more serious question -- has anyone within FidoNet
     carried out any careful experiments to test the veracity of the
     assertions against Prodigy? We've come just short of sliming
     them, now it would be nice for us to put our vaunted computer
     literacy on the line and check it out ourselves!

     Thanks for being there. Have a great week.

     Vince

                             Gateway Complaint Decision

     Matt Whelan, 3:3/1000
     International Coordinator


     It is now some time since I received a Policy Complaint/Appeal
     from Bob Moravsik, following rejections from RC13 and ZC1. My
     apologies to all for the delay in publishing the result.

     The complaint was lengthy and detailed, so I'll provide my
     'instant summary' rather than list it all here.

     In essence, Bob complained that a directive from his then-NC,
     Glen Johnson, contradicted the FidoNet<tm> Gateway Document
     adopted by me last year.

     The NC directive, to his hub coordinators, insisted they pass on
     all mail for their nodes, regardless of origin. It also insisted
     they should accept calls from any system, whether or not it was
     a FidoNet node.

     Bob complained this forced the Hub Coords to act as Gateway
     systems under FidoNet policy. Thus they would be required to
     provide outbound gating facilities as well, despite the technical
     complications this involved.

     The decision at all levels was made more difficult by the
     complaint's somewhat unclear intent: was it a protest at the NC's
     imposition of a policy at all, or at the content of the policy?

     The complaint was rejected at the RC and ZC levels. My feelings
     were that these decisions were mostly based on the first premise,
     and in that light were entirely correct.

     I believe an NC _is_ entitled to set a policy for HCs, as they
     are the NC's "deputies" and should run their portion of the net
     the way the NC would. However, if the content of the NC/Hub policy
     is contrary to (or more restrictive than, or different to, or . . .)
     FidoNet policy, then the enforcement of such NC/Hub policy could
     result in valid FidoNet policy complaints.

     Thus the Moravsik/Johnson decision finally came down to the
     content of the NC/Hub policy, and whether it really did directly
     contravene the provisions of the Gateway Document.

     The following is my 'ruling' on that aspect, as communicated
     directly to Bob Moravsik and Z1C George Peace a month or so ago.
     At that time it was also presented to the Zone Coordinators'
     Council for comment/objection (there has been very little of
     either), as I considered it an important "policy interpretation"
     issue.
     FidoNews 8-19                Page 3                   13 May 1991


     I welcome any comments on the issue, either here or in netmail
     to me at 3:712/627 or 3:3/1000.

     -Matt


     -----------------------------------------------------------------

     I believe Bob Moravsik's complaint/appeal against Glen Johnson's
     Hub Coordinators' policy to be technically correct and valid.
     However, I reject it at this time.

     When I adopted the Gateway document I noted it was not intended
     to hinder communications, and that I would allow time for its
     implementation. Given that there was no working software to
     facilitate 'correct' communication at the time the policy was
     adopted, I am prepared to wait for a reasonable time to allow
     such systems to be developed.

     The fact there is evidence of serious efforts to develop a
     standard, and the software, makes me comfortable with this
     decision.

     In the meantime, I accept each NC's individual right to choose
     whether (or not) to accept calls/mail from non-FidoNet nodes
     under the Gateway document's 'local experimentation' provisions.
     I believe once such a call has been accepted, any mail correctly
     addressed to a node in that local net must reach its intended
     recipient.

     I do not consider such operation a 'Gateway' service _at this
     time_. Thus there is no obligation on anyone in FidoNet to
     route return/outbound mail from FidoNet nodes to OtherNet
     addresses. Systems routing inbound mail are advised to run one
     of the several Netmail 'bouncers' which are capable of placing a
     warning in the inbound message. This warning would point out the
     origin system is unknown, and replies should not be routed back
     via the inbound system(s).

     Please note this an intentional and temporary relaxation of
     existing policy and, as such, will not always be acceptable.
     As the software for correct inter-network communication develops,
     the full intent of the Gateway document will be enforced to
     ensure people switch to this much-needed, and beneficial,
     new technology.

                       Sending mail through networks

     Beggining with fidonews809 (Volume 8, n. 9, 4 march 1991), a
     little announce appeared at the bottom of the fidonews issue: its
     title is "Remember Campers!!!", and it explains "how to send mail
     from an Internet site or a smart UUCP site TO a user that calls a
     Fido-Net system"

     Here I would like to give a more complete explanation of how to
     send mail from one network to another. Well, someone else has
     already done all the work, and I am only trying to give a
     contribution to their efforts. The following is the complete
     Inter-Network Mail Guide (Copyright 1990 by John J. Chew), a
     document which explains methods of sending mail from a network to
     another (when possible, of course). So, let's begin...

     [P.S. I hope that I am not violating the Copyright Notice, since
     the Inter-Network Mail Guide is distributed for non commercial
     purposes, and the file is distributed intact. I have only
     reformatted it (except only two lines, which are not
     reformattable), in order to fit the margins specifications
     written in fnewsart.doc.]

     For those of you who were wondering what happened to the June
     1990 issue, there wasn't one, because of a lack of important
     changes to the data, and because I've been busy with other
     things.  Even worse (:-), there will not be an August 1990 issue
     as I will be temporarily between net addresses as I take a nice
     long holiday between jobs on different continents.  If you have
     information to add or requests for subscriptions, send them as

     enjoy my summer now, bye!  -- John

     INTRODUCTION

     This file documents methods of sending mail from one network to
     another. It represents the aggregate knowledge of the readers of
     comp.mail.misc and many contributors elsewhere.  If you know of
     any corrections or additions to this file, please read the file
     format documentation below and then mail to me: John J. Chew
     <poslfit@gpu.utcs.utoronto.ca>.  If you do not have access to
     electronic mail (which makes me wonder about the nature of your
     interest in the subject, but there does seem to be a small such
     population out there) you can call me during the month of July at
     +1 416 979 7166 between 11:00 and 24:00 EDT (UTC-4h) and most
     likely talk to my answering machine (:-).

     DISTRIBUTION

     (news) This list is posted monthly to Usenet newsgroups
       comp.mail.misc and news.newusers.questions.
     (mail) I maintain a growing list of subscribers who receive each
       monthly issue by electronic mail, and recommend this to anyone
       planning to redistribute the list on a regular basis.
     (FTP) Internet users can fetch this guide by anonymous FTP as
       ~ftp/pub/docs/ internetwork-mail-guide on Ra.MsState.Edu
       (130.18.80.10 or 130.18.96.37) [Courtesy of Frank W. Peters]
     (Listserv) Bitnet users can fetch this guide from the Listserv at
       UNMVM. Send mail to LISTSERV@UNMVM with blank subject and body
       consisting of the line "GET NETWORK GUIDE".  [Courtesy of Art
       St. George]

     HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE

     Each entry in this file describes how to get from one network to
     another. To keep this file at a reasonable size, methods that can
     be generated by transitivity (A->B and B->C gives A->B->C) are
     omitted.  Entries are sorted first by source network and then by
     destination network.  This is what a typical entry looks like:

       #F mynet
       #T yournet
       #R youraddress
       #C contact address if any
       #I send to "youraddress@thegateway"

     For parsing purposes, entries are separated by at least one blank
     line, and each line of an entry begins with a `#' followed by a
     letter.  Lines beginning with `# ' are comments and need not be
     parsed.  Lines which do not start with a `#' at all should be
     ignored as they are probably mail or news headers.

     #F (from) and #T (to) lines specify source and destination
     networks. If you're sending me information about a new network,
     please give me a brief description of the network so that I can
     add it to the list below.  The abbreviated network names used in
     #F and #T lines should consist only of the characters a-z, 0-9
     and `-' unless someone can make a very convincing case for their
     favourite pi character.

     #R (recipient) gives an example of an address on the destination

     subsitution.

     #C (contact) gives an address for inquiries concerning the
     gateway, expressed as an address reachable from the source (#F)
     network. Presumably, if you can't get the gateway to work at all,
     then knowing an unreachable address on another network will not
     be of great help.

     #I (instructions) lines, of which there may be several, give
     verbal instructions to a user of the source network to let them
     send mail to a user on the destination network.  Text that needs
     to be typed will appear in double quotes, with C-style escapes if
     necessary.

     Interactive Video II --

     Late one night, I was watching taped episodes of Pee Wee and
     his video phone rings.  Pee Wee gets into the booth, pulls down
     the tropical paradise background matte, puts on an outrageous
     hat and picks up the tin can ear piece.  Onto his screen comes
     a guy in a couch trying to order pizza.  Wrong number...

     A two by two meter HDTV screen hangs flush against the wall in
     my home-office.  I call up my PC vid-message program and begin
     scanning through the video segments available in the echo
     areas.  As I hit the reply key, the camera record light comes
     on and I make an obscene hand gesture to emphasize my point.
     The next day I am banned from Fidonet for being excessively
     annoying...

     As I wake up somewhat disoriented, I decide to finish this
     tyrade against the phone companies.

     Last time I tried to outline the technical aspects of digital
     video transmission.  This week I'll tell you about some of the
     methods and applications for interactive video.


     Chuckin' from the Cheap Seats --

     First let me thank Alan Gilbertson who runs the CSFSO Telecom
     BBS down in Clearwater Florida for his insightful critique of
     the previous article.  The biggest mistake I made was to imply
     that the current limits of transmission technology are not
     going to be overcome any time soon.

     Specifically, the current limit of 2.5 Gigabits per second is
     not chiseled in stone.  I have reports of 25,000 Gigabits per
     seconds digital and Alan clearly pointed out the increases
     available through multiplexing.  I will continue to speak of
     'full motion' video using 'no-loss' compression techniques
     because that is the quality that I believe general usage will
     require.  It should be obvious that the bits per second
     required to achieve this will drop over time.

     Analog systems, like Orchard Communications, Wallingford CT, are
     by far the least expensive.  Orchard modulates an FM or AM
     signal onto fiber using a laser.  I believe that at the end
     points of a network, cost may justify the use of analog
     transmission.  As with coaxial cable systems, every video
     channel is available at every site ( scrambled or not ), and
     this raises privacy issues.  I tend to lean to the digital
     format anyway.

     Dedicated systems, like Grass Valley Group, Grass Valley
     California, use DS3 digital switching systems.  The network
     controller is a Sun workstation, with various remote dial in
     capabilities.  GVG markets several device control stations, for
     panning cameras or muting and they are by far the largest
     Interactive Video products company. Their switching system has
     some unique video manipulation features, but can't be used for
     other TelCo functions, like bundling voice channels.

     Cross connect systems, like Rockwell, Tellabs, Digital Switch
     and AT&T build, are DS3 or DS1 digital switching systems used
     by TelCos for trunk routing control.  These cross connects have
     point-to-point and point-to-multiple broadcast capabilities
     which make them suitable for Interactive Video and
     Conferencing.  They are also owned and operated by the TelCos,
     which allows for cost allocations favorable to the video
     network users.  PC based applications control the cross
     connects, including remote dial in.  The general goal is to use
     the DS3 capacity of the local TelCos ( local exchange carriers
     ) and the Long Distance companies ( inter exchange carriers )
     in a demand driven ( customer controlled ) network.

     The costs for digital fiber transmission are staggering.  20
     miles of working fiber could run you a cool million bucks.  45
     Megabit Video Codecs are 5000 bucks per channel.  A cross
     connect will set you back 100 k.  Not to mention the cameras,
     monitors and control software and training to operate it all.
     Who can afford it ?


     We're In the Money Dept. --

     Schools systems with government and TelCo backing.  Courts and
     law enforcement who spend millions transporting prisoners.
     Libraries with duplication of information.  Hospitals whose
     insurance rates ( and need for quality staff ) have
     skyrocketed.

     What do all these have in common ?  They are all tax payer
     funded.  They are also all suitable for the kind of tariff
     'abatement' required to get the price down to a reasonable
     level.  You see, a lot of the price is the built in rates the
     transport companies have to charge.  The emphasis on transport
     is based on the high cost of laying fiber.  This brings up the
     whole regulatory environment argument that has been raging
     since the Bell breakup.  Outside the US, especially in the
     government owned TelCos of Europe, the situation is similar

     because the prices are also artificially set.

     There is going to come a time when literally everyone is fed up
     with the communications system in the US, and then we'll start
     to see big changes.  Fidonews at 11, channel 1-800....

                           A_THEIST Echo Available


     A_theism means free of religion in the way a_political means
     free of politics or a_sexual means free of sex
     characteristics or drives.

     With that in mind and ever cognizant of the continued
     pressure of religion to intrude itself into our government
     and its operations, the A_THEIST Echo is provided to inform
     and alarm and hopefully wake up the sleeping and too long
     silent majority to the peril on our doorstep.

     It is, at present, a non-backbone Echo Hosted and Moderated
     by Rights On! [1:374/14] and Christopher Baker [card
     carrying member of American Atheists, Inc.]. Initial links
     will be provided from this system to any and all who request
     same.

     The Echo is open to anyone who can discuss, without
     proselytizing, the extreme desirability of maintaining the
     absolute separation of State and church in this country as
     provided for in our Constitution.

     A sample of the first few messages and the statement of
     purpose of the Echo is available as A_THEIST.ZIP from this
     system anytime except 0100-0130 and 0500-0800 ET [USR HST
     ds online] if you wish to get an idea of whether to commit
     disk space to the Echo.

     I hope you will join us or ask your Sysop to request a link
     via Netmail to 1:374/14.

     TTFN.

     ANEWS Mail Hauler Needed

     By Randy Edwards
     1:141/552.0

        For those of you that don't know what ANEWS is, ANEWS is an
     acronym for "Alternative NEWS" and is a backbone echo in the
     FidoNet.  ANEWS is made up of various "alternative" news and
     points of view -- opinions and news not normally found in our
     corporate-controlled mass media.

     FidoNews 8-19                Page 18                  13 May 1991


        I'm the moderator of ANEWS and have been more or less shocked
     at it's success.  ANEWS has existed for well over a year and has
     grown in size, scope and traffic.  The echo is truly
     international in scope.

        However, due to an upcoming move of mine across the country,
     the ANEWS echo in need of someone to 'haul' mail for ANEWS.
     Specifically, the ANEWS mail hauler would have to poll a 2400
     bps non-nodelisted FidoNet-compatible system in New York City
     and drop the news off at a FidoNet link so that the ANEWS
     traffic can go out over the FidoNet echomail backbone to the
     rest of the world.

        If I could find a node IN New York City that is local to the
     718-448-xxxx telephone echange to move this mail, it'd mean
     local calls for the 'mail hauler'.  If anyone is willing to be
     a 'mail hauler' for the ANEWS echo (regardless of where you are)
     please contact me, Randy Edwards, at FidoNet 1:141/552.0.
