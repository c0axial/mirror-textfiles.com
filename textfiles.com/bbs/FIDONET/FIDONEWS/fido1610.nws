     =================================================================

     Greetings,

     I've always in the old days, enjoyed the list of software which was
     posted in FidoNews, so that if needed, I knew exactly where to obtain
     it.  In fact, that was one of the first items I used to read.
     It's with great pleasure to see Peter Popovich doing the honors for
     us and I'm sure you will welcome his contribution.

     Thank you Peter, for the eefort in bringing us this list again.

     There was a complaint from one of our readers, that not each article
     submitted, had it's author's name listed.  My apology for that
     ommission, I should have checked better. ;-)

     Enjoy,

     The Case for Open Elections

     Douglas Myers, 1:270/720, doug@mdtnbbs.com

     There are plenty of good reasons to avoid an open, sysop-level
     election for the soon to be vacated post of Zone 1 Coordinator.
     Selection of a Z1C by a limited number of Regional Coordinators
     choosing from among their number is certainly a more well ordered
     process than open elections have proven to be.  In the past, open
     elections have been noisy processes, time consuming, and turn out
     has been disappointing.  Nor has the process guaranteed an adequate
     office holder.

     Most damning of all is that Fidonet Policy, while not actually
     prohibiting an open election, does clearly leave selection of a Zone
     Coordinator in the hands of the Regional Coordinators in the Zone.

     Despite the strikes against the concept, this should be the year
     that Regional Coordinators declare an open, sysop-level election for
     the office of Z1C, and ratify the results of that election.  Many
     factors indicate that this should be the year that we put aside
     strict observance of policy and go to the trouble of conducting open
     elections.

     This is not the same Fidonet which existed when Policy was written.
     The Fidonet of that time was in a period of explosive growth.  The
     daily influx of new, inexperienced sysops commanded a need for
     experienced leaders to keep the network stable.  Today's Fidonet is
     shrinking, victim of the general decline of BBSing as new computer
     users flock to the Internet.  The people in Fido today are the
     survivors of the hobby, the one's who stuck it out.  They're lean
     and experienced and unlikely to accept authority which they didn't
     choose themselves.

     Witness the changed perception of the Regional Coordinators over the
     years.  At one time, they were sufficiently respected that they were
     able to wrest control of Fidonet despite the objections of it's very
     popular founder.  In today's Fidonet, however, they are referred to
     as "Elflords" overseeing their kingdoms... not exactly a respectful
     analogy.

     Is this lack of confidence earned?  Probably not - many coordinators
     seem to do an outstanding job.  However, they are part of an
     increasingly unpopular structure - appointed, often without input
     from their constituents... and perceived to have no responsibility
     to this constituency of increasingly experienced sysops.

     A Zone Coordinator chosen from among their ranks with no input from
     sysops will simply have no mandate and suffer the same loss of
     confidence which afflicts the coordinator structure.

     It's a new year for Fidonet.  Can the Coordinator structure shed the
     ElfLord image?  Will it finally be the Year of the Elves?

     At the time of this writing, I assumed the duties of the Usenet
     gateway for our net (1:103).  Currently under development is to
     establish one or more news servers to  provide a nntp gateway to
     those formerly members of fidonet.  I expect that we will have
     this feed up and running within the week.  Personally, I am sick
     to death of politicing with echomail, and most disturbed that the
     backbone zone hubs can't seem to work out their differences in
     private.  Among the recent developments I see however on a positive
     note is that the NAB has changed their echo addition policies to the
     near anarchy that it should be.  Hopefully this change will further
     discrourage the trend towards extinction and revitalize fidonet.

     I was a member of Fidonet in its younger days when its echo areas are
     were full of stimulating conversation. You will long be remembered as
     some of the best years of my life, and some of the greatest flame fest
     I have ever been entertained by. Your mail packets drained my wallet,
     but you were worth every dime. Your systems are now few and your
     nodelist lays almost empty, resembeling that of the very first. Your
     hollow halls are no longer that of intellectual conversation, but one
     of echos. Echos of past votes for power and prestige in amoung your
     once strong zones and networks. Those that once terrorized the
     innocent SysOps with their unforgiving power are now simply a has been
     on the Internet. It is not your fault that you are gone, it is the
     fault of those who abused you.
     Your days were numbered from the very first conversations passed back
     in St Louis. We thought you would live forever and become a true giant
     among men, and you did exactly that. You may be gone but you will
     never be forgotten. Now I will turn out the light and let you get your
     long deserved rest. Thank you for being there when there was nothing
     else.
     Goodbye old friend *click*

     Latest Greatest Software Versions
     by Peter E. Popovich, 1:228/158

     Well, it has been quite a while. Been wondering if I should come
     back. Guess I just did. <grin>

     Everything is out of date. I've got a backlog, but while I catch
     up on old mail, I also want to get new mail as well. So write me.

     There's been some speculation about web page listings and e-mail
     addresses for this list. I do plan to add them to the web version
     of this list within the next couple of weeks. Please send them in.
