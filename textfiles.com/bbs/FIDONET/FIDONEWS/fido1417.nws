     We're chock full of strife and adventure in this week's Issue after a
     week of rest.

     I got a feeling that no one ever reads the Headlines since nobody
     complained or sent me a dollar. [snicker]

     Region 19 has a new RC but nobody from there sent in a notice about
     that either. Bruce Bodger should be appearing as RC19 in your Nodelist
     shortly if not already in there as same. Congrats, Bruce.

     There is a ZEC election in progress in case you were unaware of it.
     The details can be witnessed by linking to the ZEC Echo. It's mostly
     harangues and counter-charges, as usual in Echomail, but if you want
     to be informed, you need to go there and watch.

     Rumor has it that the IC election is in deadlock again at 3 to 3. Here
     is another GOOD reason to break Zone 2 up into an eastern bloc Zone 7
     and adding another vote to the ZCC to avoid ties.

     That's the view from the bridge this week. Enjoy!

     C.B.

                            INTERNATIONAL BBS WEEK

     Just a note to say that if you want to do something to help reverse
     the trend of BBS's vanishing to the internet, then International BBS
     week might be the way to go.

     Inspired by a message in FN_SYSOP by Ivey Iverson(sp), and proposed by
     Anne Pickets in NZ_SYSOP, International BBS week is a week where
     SysOp's do what they can to advertise BBS's in their respective areas,
     whether it's doing a spot on a TV show, or taking out full-page
     adverts in the local newspapers, each person doing what they can to
     help out, whether it's appearing on TV or donating towards a week long
     run of full-page (or even TV) adverts.

     If the moderators don't mind, discussion should be carried out where
     the most people can be reached. My personal preference is FN_SYSOP,
     since it already reaches most areas, and of course local SysOp
     conference's.

     The date for International BBS Week is the first week of June, 1997 (s
     suggested by Anne). However, this is only a preliminary date and is
     open to discussion.

     If we can make this thing big it enough, we should be able to spark
     sufficient interest in the international media that they will do some
     of the work for us, granting interviews and spreading the word to more
     people than we could imagine reaching.

     If any one has any questions they wish to ask me personally, or they
     can't/ won't read FN_SYSOP, they can reach me at 3:771/1560 or on the
     internet -david.chord@cobra.galaxy.gen.nz. Naturally, FidoNet Netmail
     is preferable :-)

     So, get out there, start planning, and let's do what we can to make
     BBS's the popular places they once were!

     Here is a cross post from our new regional coordinator (Congrats

     Re: Re: Copyright Notice
     St: Pvt  Rcvd
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     Hello David,

     > What is the background of your dropping the Copyright Notice of the
     > Z2-Nodelist?

     Some time ago a person wanted to write non-commercially something
     somewhere about Fido and kinda liked the art-work on the dog with the
     diskette. (name of the person escapes me, but I seem to recall a
     similar incident connected to the last Eurocon) So, truthfully
     believing Tom Jennings holds a trademark on this (as was mentioned in
     the nodelist and still is in Fidonews) he asks permission to use it,
     which Tom flatly refused.

     As I found this rather a strange reaction, out of curiosity I asked
     some of our corporate lawyers to look into the copyright- and
     trademark-issue of "Fido", "Fidonet" and the artwork of the dog-with-
     diskette. (FYI, I'm Deputy-Director at the Belgian telco, employing
     some 27,000 staff and we have acorporate-law-division who does nothing
     else than copyright and trademark stuff)

     As I so suspected for a long time, I received confirmation after
     researching relevant trademark-bureaus that no references to the above
     nor any trademark held by a Jennings Tom or Tom Jennings relating to
     Fidonet or something similarly sounding exists.

     Mark my words ... this covers the whole of Europe (east and west)
     including Israel and Turkey. It says nothing about the USA.
     FIDONEWS 14-17               Page 4                   28 Apr 1997


     We discovered however expired Fidonet-trademarks in the name of other
     individuals residing in Europe.

     A quick search was done for Japan (where ZC/6 resides) without any TJ-
     trademark. Same thing in Argentina (homebase of ZC/4) where TJ holds
     no rights but where, very puculiarly, another trademark called "Latin
     Fido" is held by a local sysop (this is also reflected in the Z4-
     nodelist).

     So let me summarise :

     There is _NO_ existing trademark in Europe in the name of Tom Jennings
     nor Jennings Tom for "Fido", "Fidonet" nor the "dog-with-diskette"-
     artwork.

     Then why write it in the nodelist? I don't see one single reason.

     Now let's not confuse "trademark" with "copyright".

     If TJ wants to have a trademark on all those items then as far as I'm
     concerned he can have it ... which means he must have his brand-names
     registered in each and every country - for zone-2 this means 35-
     countries to be precise - and agree to pay the periodical hefty sum on
     that.  (worldwide 190+ ?)

     This he has never done, nor will he do it, nor will anyone else
     because it is just too expensive. "Control" over the nodelist can
     never warrant such a high price nor can anyone ever expect a return on
     that investment.

     If anyone ever has any bright idea here to register the trademarks to
     either "control" or "financially exploit" then I hereby post a claim
     to be first in line to laugh that person straight in his/her face.

     Less than a year ago there was the case of a company registering a
     trademark on the wording "world wide web" and "www", which mind you
     are nowhere legally protected. After initial astonishment by the
     internet-community the "owners" were quickly reduced to the laughing
     stock even while they followed correct legal procedures. They tried to
     exercise a claim and finally gave up because it was reasonably un-
     enforceable.

     With Fidonet it is exactly the same thing.

     Now one final word about "copyright". TJ does not participate in any
     way in the production of any of the nodelists nor any of the segments
     that comprise the nodelist. Hence there is not one square inch of
     legal ground for him to claim copyright over it.

     The NC's could have a copyright over net-segments, the RC's over
     region-segments and the ZC's over zone-segments. Since the ZC's also
     produce nodelists they could imo also post a copyright-notice for
     their version of the nodelist although I think all these notices carry
     little weight and are of little to no importance.

     Anyone in zone-2 having problems with the nodelist without a TJ-
     FIDONEWS 14-17               Page 5                   28 Apr 1997


     copyright/ trademark notification can always freq at this node the
     elements it takes to produce their own nodelist.

     Every current zone-2 region-segment can be freqqed here with the
     magic-name REGIONxx where xx = regionnumber.

     On top of that every zone-segment can be freqqed here following the
     same logic : ZONEy where y = zonenumber.

     It enables everyone who wants that to build his/her own customized
     nodelist.

     If a person e.g. only wants R24, R50 and Z3, then he/she freqs
     REGION24, REGION50, ZONE3 and gives that to his/her nodelist-compiler.
     How's that for openness, availability, service, whatever you wanna
     call it?

     If they want to include the original notice they can equally freq "TJ"
     here so that bit of information is accessible as well although it
     makes no difference.

     As a sidenote, I already received threats for a court-case by one
     Randy Bush, the same person when slamming the Fido-door shut behind
     him stated it was nothing else but a litter-box reeking of cat-piss.

     I understand some valid concerns about intentions and motives, but I
     do have a more than full-time and well payed job so I don't need to
     try to squeeze some extra pennies (at what cost?) out of some peoples
     pockets. I believe it would be very difficult, if not impossible, for
     any individual to grab control of the nodelist and make a buck out of
     it.

     If that happens then it is because the sysops allow it to happen,
     personally I would just totally ignore such a person.

     There's a lesson to be learned from our German friends who would never
     take any shit like that. This they proved after some "grab control"-
     exercises there.

     I'm more worried about the censoring of Fidonews-worldwide by a ZC
     which recently occured and nobody reacted upon it. Weren't you aware?

     Thanks for writing. If there's more you want to ask, please do.

     Take care,

       \x/ard Dossche
            ZC/2

     The Death of a Friend!
     By:  Clay Tannacore  1:372/4

     My friends, I write to you this day with a saddened heart.  My friend
     of thirteen years has passed away.  Sure, I know he was only a dog,
     but he was full of spunk, full of pride, and filled with everything
     anyone could have asked for.  I picked him up in 1985, and knew right
     away he was my kind of dog.  He was young and inexperienced with a
     future that should have been endless.  He was bright and trusting,
     with just enough reserve to be cautious of new people, but was always
     ready to allow them into his world.  I would look into his eyes, and
     he mine, and we understood each other, instantaneously.  I named him
     the only name I could think of, the only name that suited him, and he
     in turn named me.  His name was a struggle for me at first, but I
     think I had heard the name before, and it just seemed to fit him
     flawlessly.

     Over the years we had grown up together, we learned from each other.
     He with his youthful inexperience, and me new to having such a gifted
     friend.  There were many a cold night that he and I would reveal in
     each others company.  He would keep me in touch with the realities of
     the world, and I would entertain myself by utilizing his abilities.
     He never seemed to amaze me in his capacity to teach and entertain.
     Even as a young and unknowledgeable puppy he still possessed the
     capability to render me speechless with his stubborn wisdom of worldly
     things.  He ability to adept to new and better things was uncanny, and
     soon I was a slave to his commands.  No, he didn't require me to be
     house-broken, but he did insist that I continually learn new and more
     progressive things.

     My dog made my life a better substance.  He loved me, and I him.  He
     was faithful to me for all those years, by my side almost constantly,
     and when not there, he was forever on my mind.  I made it a point not
     to leave him for to long, and I made a point of laying my hands on his
     strong supportive shoulders as often as feasible.  Then came that ugly
     time in 1991, when sickness took over my body, and I was forced to be
     away from my friend for too long.  The sickness was worsening, and I
     was made to go to the hospital for a very long time.  I had to leave
     my dog in those trying times, but I remained faithful to him, and he
     didn't forget me.

     As the time passed, and my health became a non-point, I was reunited
     with my dog once again.  I was happy, even jubilant at seeing him
     still able to function.  But, my dog had changed, and he didn't seem
     to have the same old spunk or vigor about him.  He had a different
     personality, a different look, and a totally different feel about him.
     I found it increasingly hard to relate to this wonderful puppy I had
     once learned to love.  The attitude of my dog was not the same, almost
     nothing seemed the same anymore.  He was more vicious, not only
     towards me, but towards others, too.

     FIDONEWS 14-17               Page 8                   28 Apr 1997


     I viewed my dog for months before trying to play in his new world, but
     couldn't seem to revive my old feelings about him.  He had become
     sassy, inconsiderate and hateful.  This was not the dog I remembered,
     this was a total stranger, with nothing more than malignity on his
     mind.  No longer was my dog the happy, rousting puppy I had come
     across in 1985, this was a vindictive, hateful mongrel who was an
     unfriendly entity, possessed by some demonic apparition, but who was
     passing himself off as my dog.

     So it is that today, I have nothing but memories left of my little,
     immature puppy, and all the fine things he once represented.  No more
     will I have the pleasure of knowing him, as I once knew him.  He's
     gone now, dead, passed away!  But still I can fondly look back at that
     special time he and I once had, and remember that fateful day that I
     gave him his borrowed name.  I called him FIDO, to start with, but
     that didn't seem suitable for him, so I tried FIDOMUT, FIDONUT and
     even FIDODOG.  None of those names seem to suit him, but somehow he
     was finally named FIDONET.  It was a GREAT day for me when finally his
     name was chosen, and it was an even greater time when he chose his
     name for me, that being "1:372/4."

     Well, what did you expect, he was only a puppy then, and I was a
     virgin when it came to puppy-sitting.  He has gone now, buried in the
     shadow of the Internet, www.bullshit.com, MSN, AOL, etc., etc.  He

     meet 'my' FIDO.  You missed the best years of FIDO's life, and there
     will never be another like it. . .    "BUT YOU CAN HOPE!"

     RC 2:24 election result
     by Frank Ellermann, 2:240/5815.1

     The second RC 2:24 election following the local RegPol 24 (*1) just
     ended. The following is its preliminary run-off result as reported
     by the RO Jan N. Klug:

      valid votes    : 594   (100,00%)
      abstentions    :  48   (  8,08%)
      Volker Imre    : 199   ( 33,50%)
      Klaus Schaefer : 347   ( 58,42%)

     No candidate got an absolute majority in the first run, therefore a
     run-off was necessary. The preliminary result of the first run was:

      valid votes    : 375   (100,00%)
      Frank Neubauer :   9   (  2,40%)
      abstentions    :  24   (  6,40%)
      Ralf Schnele   :  27   (  7,20%)
      Wulf Krueger   :  76   ( 20,27%)

      Volker Imre    : 115   ( 30,67%)
      Klaus Schaefer : 124   ( 33,07%)

     Condolence, oops, congratulations to Klaus, and thanks to Ralf, Wulf,
     and Volker for standing. And after being VO in the 1st RC election '96
     following RegPol 24 my special thanks to Jan (RO), Burkhard (VO), and
     the election supervisor Ward Dossche. These are "interesting" jobs, if
     I recall it correctly :-) Let's hope that the two weeks for nitpicking
     objections and challenges are less "interesting" than 1996.

     Footnote (*1): To be precise, RegPol 24 is not yet a real "approved by
     IC" local policy, but only considered as in force by all affected *Cs,
     just because there was no IC to ask for his approval.

     To be more precise, we had no FidoNet IC since almost 2 years, because
     the beloved leader of 131 nodes (including 43 redundant administrative
     AKAs) Z5C wants to be IC and blocks democratic candidates like Pablo
     or Ward. To call this XAB is pure understatement, just because without
     an IC P4-Fido is officially non-functional and formally non-existent.

     To be very precise, those who enforced policy 4 without a proper sysop
     referendum should burn in hell together with Z5C for this sort of sh*t
     (deliberately neither vague nor sorry).

     Zone 2 coordinator election result
     by Frank Ellermann, 2:240/5815.1

     Here's the final result of the Z2C election confirmed by Detlef Nick
     as spokesman of the election committee:

      Ward Dossche           2:292/854      18 RCs out of 22 = 81,8 %
      Carlos Fernandez Sanz  2:341/70        1 RC  (R34)     =  4,5 %
      Stig Hansen            2:236/58        1 RC  (R52)     =  4,5 %
      Robert Spangler        2:2494/360      0 RC
      No vote                                2 RCs (R22,R31) =  9,1 %

     10 Regions (37, 38, 39, 42, 44, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, and 54) are not
     represented by a valid vote, including 3 formally invalid or too late
     votes for Ward. Congratulations to Ward, thanks to the other three
     candidates, and last but not least thanks to the election committee:
     Detlef Nick, Tony Kuznetsov, Frank Peterson, Tirs Abril, and Pertti
     Heikkinen.

     The most interesting aspect (for me :-) in this ZC election were the
     procedural considerations and discussions before. In Z2 most regions
     correspond to states, ranging from only a handful nodes as in Malta,
     Iceland, Luxembourg, or Saudi-Arabia, to several thousands of nodes
     as in Germany or Russia.

     Of course it is not fair, if all these completely different regions
     are equally represented by the one and only vote of their RCs, but a
     simple "one sysop - one vote" approach would also not reflect the Z2
     FidoNet reality.
     FIDONEWS 14-17               Page 10                  28 Apr 1997


     Even worse, policy 4 disregards sysops in all kinds of coordination,
     an RC could "legally" vote against the wishes of his own region. The
     election committee used the same trick as in the ZEC election 1996 to
     discourage such misbehavior: Regional polls before the RC votes were
     strongly recommended, the votes of the RCs were published, and now we
     have about two years to create a local policy with improved election
     procedures for zone 2.

     The result of the regional poll in R2:24 as stated by Eckhard Mueller:

      Ward Dossche           79,      Robert J. Spangler    29,
      Carlos Fernandez Sanz   9,      Stig Hansen            6,
      abstentions             6,      valid votes totally  129.

     Not very impressive for a region with over 3000 sysops, but the list
     of voters looks like a who-is-who in R24 FidoNet, so it's not too bad
     after all. Maybe it's interesting, that a clear majority supported
     Ward instead of the R24 candidate. Although the Z2 regions correspond
     to states, this does not reflect nationalism, but banally the not yet
     united national telecom providers and their tariffs in Z2. Of course
     the former RC24 cast his vote for Ward following this regional poll.

     Again the most interesting detail (for me :-) in this poll was a new
     procedure invented by Eckhard Mueller. Normally (NC and RC elections)
     we have 4 phases in an election, each two weeks, call for candidates,
     discussion, first run, and run-off, if no candidate got an absolute
     majority in the first run.

     The time table for the regional ZC election poll was too limited for a
     separate run-off, therefore Eckhard combined both in only one ballot.
     Each vote contained up to 4 candidates in the order of preference,
     e.g.  Stig-Carlos-Robert would be a vote for Stig as 1st choice. For
     the 1st run only the 1st choices were evaluated.

     If hypothetically no candidate won an absolute majority in this first
     run, but Ward and Robert are the run-off candidates, then in the same
     example Stig-Carlos-Robert 1st and 2nd choice are eliminated. The vote
     then goes to Robert in the run-off. That was a cute idea, wasn't it ?

     The Great ZEC Election hoax...Part 2
     by Zorch Frezberg, 1:205/1701

     There comes a time and a point where you really have to sit down and
     decide what is more important...personal feelings or principles.

     While I am not the greatest nor fervent supporter of Bob Moravsik, I
     do feel that he has a right to participate in an election for which
     he is a nominee...if for no other reason than to find out what his
     platform is, and whether his ability outweighs his rhetoric.

     Unfortunately, it seems that the ZEC-appointed Election Coordinator,
     who was also the ZEC-appointed EchoMail Ombudsman, who is also the
     chief defender of the ZEC and moderator of the ZEC echo, with the

     assistance and advice of the ZEC, Bruce Bodger (who was also elected
     as R19C but still remains in place with the ZEC hat on, as well as
     the OBO hat on top of his personal FTSC Moderator hat...making at
     least five hats in all), has seen fit to not only deny free and open
     access to nominees for the ZEC post, but also to threaten those who
     dare to 'ask questions'.

     1)  Terms of someone else's banning are not any of your business.
         You have no standing to interpose yourself in those decisions.
         If Moravsik wants to request removal of his banning, then HE needs
         to ask and HE needs to deal properly with the issues which caused
         the banning in the first place.  Your comments are neither

     At the same time, I also challenge Jason Steck to present the

     FYI, the election rules and procedures were approved by the ZC before
     the election began, so continued whining, complaining, campaigning,
     lobbying, conspiracy-mongering, threats, flames, etc, etc, etc is
     without purpose.

     =================================================

     The present ZEC election process is becoming more of a fraud each
     passing day.

     Candidates banned from campaigning, persons questioning the process
     are threatened with feed cuts, and no open nomination process, with
     everything being clandestinely covered up in netmail.

     What is the true fear here?  That an open election may result in a
     candidate voted in that the Election Coordinator does not want...or
     has been told not to allow to participate?

     When open election discussion is so severely limited, there is little
     doubt that an agenda of control and manipulation is involved...and
     very little about 'fairness' and 'openness'...especially when no one
     is allowed to know who has or has not been nominated in an open
     manner.

     Please contact your *C and *EC to help halt this farce of an election.

     Several well-known names have been presented or volunteered to act as
     Election Coordinator or ZEC moderator, and all have been rejected so
     that Jason Steck and Bruce Bodger can remain in control of the
     election process.

     Why do we tolerate this level of control and manipulation?

                           Proposed Guidelines for the FileBone
                                     Erik VanRiper
                                       1:107/230

     Status of this document:

          This FSC suggests a proposed protocol for the FidoNet(r)
          community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
          improvements.  Distribution of this document is unlimited.

          Fido and FidoNet are registered marks of Tom Jennings and Fido
          Software.

       1.  Purpose.

           The purpose of this document is to set down basic guidelines for
           the handling of File Distribution Networks on a "File
           Distribution Backbone".

       2.  Definition of Terms.

         a.  FDN.  FDN is a File Distribution Network, made up of at least
             one file area dedicated to moving files through Fidonet
             compatible mailers for other nodes to utilize.  An example of
             this is the Software Distribution Network or SDS as it is more
             commonly known.

         b.  FTN.  FTN is a term coined to signify that another Network
             besides FidoNet has the same technology as FidoNet, and can
             transfer files and mail via FTSC-001 compatible mailers.  An
             example of this is SigNet.

         c.  TICK.  TICK (and HATCH) is (C) Copyright Barry Geller - 1988,
             1989, 1990, 1991, 1992.  TICK is the current popular way to
             move files in FTN's participating in File Distribution.

         d.  FILEBONE.  FILEBONE is the "File Distribution Backbone".  The
             term FILEBONE is used in place of BACKBONE because the
             BackBone is used for transfering mail, not files.  There is a
             seperate document for procedures of FidoNet BackBone systems.
     FIDONEWS 14-17               Page 14                  28 Apr 1997


       3.  Reasons for this Document.

         a.  Spending the last five months compiling information on all the
             FDN's and how the files are moving in each, I noticed that a
             lot of time, money, and hassle can be avoided by creating a
             well defined mechinism by which all FDN's can participate.  In
             the past, (and currently), there has been more concern by the
             heads of individual FDN's as to WHO is picking up their FDN,
             and not enough concern in how FAST those nodes are getting
             newly hatched files.  This document will attempt to address
             both issues.

         b.  Personally, I feel that there is not enough credit given to
             those major file hubs all over the world who pay an arm and a
             leg to pick up different FDN's from several different
             locations to support 50 or more FTN systems they have polling
             for support.  These HUMANS have always worked hard, and
             received almost no credit.  I would just like to take time out
             in this document to thank each and every one of them for the
             wonderful support they have contributed to several different
             FTN's.

       4.  The Outline.

         a.  The FILEBONE will be created in several stages, taking up to a
             year to become fully operational.  This will require several
             support programs to be written, tested, and documented, as
             well as re-arranging current FDN links to test speed and
             reliability of actually moving the files.

         b.  The FILEBONE will consist of no less than 15 systems in Zone 1
             (I cannot speak for other zones).  Each system will be
             required to make at least one call a night to drop off and
             pick up ALL the available FDN's that are participating in the
             FILEBONE.  These FILEBONE sites will also be primary hubs
             (acting as "stars") for other FTN compatible systems
             interested in obtaining parts (or all) of the files
             transferred.

         c.  Each FILEBONE site will use several different programs written
             to aid in locating delays, problems, and undesireable
             conditions while processing the files.  They will also be
             required to submit "File Distribution Reports" each week to
             the FILEBONE database, which will maintain and analyze the
             information, detecting possible problem areas.

         d.  Each FILEBONE site will be required to submit to the wishes of
             each FDN concerning hatching policies, linking policies,
             cutting of links to problem nodes, and general reporting of
             usage.  FILEBONE sites are not "pawns" of individual FDN's,
             but "tools" for each FDN to use to get their files (and
             support conferences) from one end of the FILEBONE to the
             other.

         e.  Each FDN will be required to submit a statment of agreement to
             this document to the FILEBONE systems, as the FILEBONE systems
     FIDONEWS 14-17               Page 15                  28 Apr 1997


             are the ones paying to move their files.

         f.  The FILEBONE will consist of a two-tierd system.  The largest
             being the actualy FILEBONE, where all the "released" files
             will be transported.  The second smaller level will be a "back
             area" for each FDN that requires one.  The concept is this: If
             a system hatches a file in area GENERAL, and Joe Smith, the
             moderator of the GENERAL area has not authorized that system
             to hatch into that area, the first FILEBONE site to get this
             file will move that file to the GENERAL "back area" for review
             by Joe Smith.  Once Joe Smith decides on suitability, he will
             then send a message back to that FILEBONE site (and all other
             in-between) saying it is OK to let the file pass, delete the
             file, or alter the description of that file before letting it
             pass.  The FILEBONE will move the file to that FDN's moderator
             on the "back area", so all FILEBONE sites that have already
             seen the file can simply "move" that file back into
             distribution, so that those FILEBONE sites already having the
             file will not need to re-transfer it.  This system ensures
             that there is only a small delay in time for checking the
             validity of that file.  A basic diagram follows:

             Key:  "="   = FILEBONE
                   "-"   = "Back area"
                   1:0/x = FILEBONE sites
                   0:5/x = FDN nodes
                   A     = Node hatching
                                                     0:5/5
                                                       |
                                                       |
            A ----> 1:0/0 ---- 1:0/1 ---- 1:0/2 ---- 1:0/3 ---- 1:0/4
                      |==========+==========+==========+==========+

             System A hatches file "FILENAME.ZIP" into the GENERAL file
             area.  1:0/0 detects that system is not on the list authorized
             to hatch files into the GENERAL file area, so sends the file
             to 1:0/1 in the GENERAL backarea, enroute to 0:5/5.  When
             0:5/5 gets FILENAME.ZIP, 1:0/0, 1:0/1, 1:0/2, and 1:0/3 will
             have already seen the file, and 1:0/4 has not.  Joe Smith (The
             moderator of the GENERAL file area), at 0:5/5 will test
             FILENAME.ZIP to see if it is acceptable for distribution.  If
             it is, Joe Smith will send a netmail message back to a program
             running on 1:0/3, letting the FILEBONE know it is OK to
             distribute the file.  1:0/3 will then move the file to the
             GENERAL area, and continue to send it on.  1:0/3 will also
             generate a message back to 1:0/2 letting them know the status
             of the file, and so on, until 1:0/0 has finally moved the file
             back into the GENERAL area.  Another options to Joe Smith are
             to have the file deleted (Usually because it has been
             duplicated), or to have the file fowarded to another FDN
             moderator, where the file would be more suitable.  With this
             method of checking files, FDN's can allow the FILEBONE to let
             anyone hatch files into their FDN without having to worry
             about duplicates or programs that are not suitable for that
             FDN.

         g.  FILEBONE sites will also be required to keep an online
             database available to any nodes requiring information about
             individual FDN areas.  This information will include:

               1.  Average traffic per week and month.
               2.  Average time to obtain file submitted.
               3.  A listing of nodes carrying that FDN area.
               4.  Guidelines, applications, and policies associated with
                   that FDN.

             This will be an automated process, carried out much like a
             node sending an AREAFIX or RAID request.  The FILEBONE site
             being queried for the information is only resposible for 2
             things:

               1.  Ensuring the database is operational.
               2.  Placing the requested information on hold for pickup.

             Anything else that FILEBONE site does with the request for
             information is at their disgression, such as sending back the
             information on their dime.

         h.  All FILEBONE sites will be required to drop the individual
             "User Flags" in the nodelist that corespond to individual
             FDN's (in regions that allow Uxxx flags in the nodelist).
             They will instead use the "UFDN" flag.  This will help (albeit
             a small amount) cut down on the flag usage in the nodelist,
             since all the FILEBONE sites will be moving most of the
             available file areas.


       5.  The FILEBONE has started, with 21 systems in Zone 1, one system
           in Zone 2, and several "OtherNets" getting involved by the day.
           Several of the programs outlined in this document have already
           been written, and are in use, being tested.  There are still a
           few more programs to be written, but things are running smoothly
           as of the date on this document.  99% of the known FDN's in
           FidoNet are linked into the FILEBONE in one form or another, and
           the future looks very promising.

           This document is by no means complete.  There are several other
           aspects to FDN's and FILEBONE that are not discussed here.  This
           document is put forth for comments, additions, deletions, and
           all general changes.  This is only how I (the author of this
           document) envision the FILEBONE operating, and this document may
           be flawed in one or several areas.

     Status of this document:

          This FSC suggests a proposed protocol for the FidoNet(r)
          community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
          improvements.  Distribution of this document is unlimited.

          Software.

     | Note
     | ----

     | Changes in content between the previous edition of this document,
     | and this edition, are signified by bars (|) in the left margin,
     | except where otherwise specified. I have changed the format of the
     | document slightly to allow this. Where the format of the document
     | has changed, but the actual text has not, bars are not present.

       Purpose
       -------

       There are currently several systems within FidoNet that offer file
       request or mail holding capabilities but are not continuously
       online. The only time during which these nodes can be contacted with
       reference to the nodelist is currently the Zone Mail Hour of the
       zone to which the systems belong. In
     | theory, mailers can only use the zone mail hour(s) specified by the
       system in question to contact these nodes, which does not provide
       for any method
       of file requesting or calling for echomail that does not conflict
       with the Policy requirement that no echomail or files be transferred
       during the zone | mail hour. This means that, in practice, if it is
       known that a particular
     | node is online for more time than ZMH alone, but less than 24 hours
       a day,
     | it is necessary to "kludge," or set this up as a special situation,
       in most | mailers whenever a node has to be contacted a number of
       times, whether
     | regularly or irregularly. The proposed flag would benefit the
       mailers in such a way as to provide for them the online times that
       the node is usually online for, thus cutting on the costs of calling
       a non-continuous mail node, only to find that it is not available;
       and also, hopefully preventing annoyance for a sysop whose mailer is
       being called whilst it is not online, for example in the case of a
       voice/data shared line.

       Compatibility
       -------------

       Since the current nodelist format is always being extended and
       nodelist
     | processors look only for the flags that they know about, there are
       no expected compatibility problems with the suggestion outlined
       below.

       Format of additional nodelist flag
       ----------------------------------

       The proposed nodelist flag has the following form:

         Txy

     | where x represents the startup time, and y the end time, in the
       following format:

        +------+----+  +------+----+  +------+----+  +------+----+  +------
        +----+ |Letter|Time|  |Letter|Time|  |Letter|Time|  |Letter|Time|
        |Letter|Time| +------+----+  +------+----+  +------+----+  +------
        +----+  +------+----+
        |   A  |0000|  |   F  |0500|  |   K  |1000|  |   P  |1500|  |   U
        |2000|
        |   a  |0030|  |   f  |0530|  |   k  |1030|  |   p  |1530|  |   u
        |2030|
        |   B  |0100|  |   G  |0600|  |   L  |1100|  |   Q  |1600|  |   V
        |2100|
        |   b  |0130|  |   g  |0630|  |   l  |1130|  |   q  |1630|  |   v
        |2130|
        |   C  |0200|  |   H  |0700|  |   M  |1200|  |   R  |1700|  |   W
        |2200|
        |   c  |0230|  |   h  |0730|  |   m  |1230|  |   r  |1730|  |   w
        |2230|
        |   D  |0300|  |   I  |0800|  |   N  |1300|  |   S  |1800|  |   X
        |2300|
        |   d  |0330|  |   i  |0830|  |   n  |1330|  |   s  |1830|  |   x
        |2330|
        |   E  |0400|  |   J  |0900|  |   O  |1400|  |   T  |1900|  |
        |    |
        |   e  |0430|  |   j  |0930|  |   o  |1430|  |   t  |1930|  |
        |    | +------+----+  +------+----+  +------+----+  +------+----+
        +------+----+

     | The case of the letter could be relevant. Whereas the case is
       currently not
     | used by any flags in the document describing the current format of
       the
     | nodelist, there exists the potential for the case of a letter to
       have
     | relevant meaning. The case has to be correct for the CRC check
       calculation
     | to prove correct, and this would be a good use for the case of the
       letter.  If it is necessary to ignore the case, then the upper on-
       the-hour time should be used, i.e. the time that is listed after the
     FIDONEWS 14-17               Page 19                  28 Apr 1997


       upper-case letter.

       These times are expressed in GMT (UTC) so that the flag is useful
       for systems all around the world, without the need for specific time
       zone information to be included in the nodelist. They do not adjust
       with
     | daylight saving time for a similar reason. Note the section on
       daylight
     | saving time for information about handling adjustments without
       changing the | flag; this is important.

       Where necessary, the times can wrap around midnight, so for example,
       for a node that is online between the hours of 1800 and 0600 GMT,
       the flag TSG would be a valid indication of this time.

       This nodelist entry is not required by any node. It is supplementary
       to the | #01, #02, #08, #09, #18, #20 flags and their !xx
       counterparts, though its
     | meaning is different. It has been suggested to me about the
       possibility of an additional flag with the same meaning, but having
       a W as the first letter, indicating that the node is also available
       for all hours during weekends; however, I believe that the simple
       inclusion of the single flag indicated above will solve most
       problems, as it does indicate a period for
     | non-CM nodes during which the node is available, which is all that
       is
     | really required.

     | Daylight saving time
     | --------------------

     | If a node changes online times with respect to UTC when daylight
       saving
     | time becomes effective (which would be the case with most part time
       nodes),
     | then this is to be taken into account when assigning this flag. An
       online
     | times flag assigned to a node should not be altered for the specific
     | purpose of adjusting due to daylight saving time, since large
       difference
     | files (NODEDIFF's) would result if every node was allowed to do
       this, e.g.
     | my node used to be online from 2300 to 0800 in local time, which in
       winter
     | is GMT (which is equivalent to UTC for the purposes of this
       document), but in the summer it becomes BST (British Summer Time).
       This is one hour ahead of GMT, and the corresponding availability
       times of my node during the summer period were 2200 to 0700 GMT.
       Therefore my online times flag would
     | have indicated availability between the hours of 2300 and 0700 GMT,
       the
     | daily time period encompassing both times, so the flag would be TXH.

     | Policy considerations
     | ---------------------

     FIDONEWS 14-17               Page 20                  28 Apr 1997


     | This is a technical document. However, since the flag could make for
       an
     | increase in the size of difference files, the author feels that the
     | following guidelines should be adopted concerning the use of the
       flag.

     | The online times flag does not replace the requirement for
       exclusivity of
     | zone mail hour to be maintained. It is still annoying behaviour to
       have
     | this flag and be unavailable during ZMH, just as it is annoying
       behaviour
     | to have the CM (continuous mail) flag in one's entry, and disregard
       ZMH.

     | Except for during ZMH, the sysop of a node using this flag finding
       that
     | they need to take their mailer offline during the specified times to
     | perform system maintenance, or for any other reason, would not be
       acting in | an annoying manner to do so, unless the practice is
       found to be continuous,
     | in which case the flag's times could be reduced, or the flag itself
       could
     | be removed from their node entry.

     | It should be noted that this flag is present for the benefit of
       mailers,
     | not human beings. This means that the flag should be used only to
       indicate
     | when a mailer is ready to receive calls. A system that uses a
       FidoNet-
     | technology mailer in ZMH, and a human-access only system during
       other
     | period(s) of the day that cannot receive mail, should not use this
       flag.
     | This flag does not explicitly specify online times of a public
       access BBS,
     | although for presumably most nodes with FidoNet-capable software, a
       public
     | access BBS will be available during the times indicated.

     | Where the flag is used, it should not often be changed. If a
       situation
     | exists, for example, where a node uses a certain set of times during
       the
     | first two weeks of a month, and a different set of times during the
     | remainder period, the flag should be set to a time during each day
       of the
     | month when the node is online. For example, if a node is online
       during
     | 1800-0800 for the first two weeks, and then during 2200-1000 for the
     | remainder, the time flag should specify 2200-0800 only. If there is
       no such
     | time (other than ZMH) then no flag should be used. Of course, any
       permanent
     | changes, and any necessary reductions in the times, should be
     FIDONEWS 14-17               Page 21                  28 Apr 1997


       permitted at
     | any time, but changes owing only to daylight saving time should
       certainly
     | be expressly forbidden.

     | File requests and user access are of course permitted during the
       online
     | times indicated (except ZMH).

     | The above list may seem rather frightening! Please note that they
       are
     | guidelines rather than rules, unless FidoNet policy has included
       them as
     | rules. In the vast majority of situations where a node is online for
       a
     | fixed set of hours per day, the only thing to watch out for is that
       you get
     | the daylight saving time period right. Then you don't have to worry
       about
     | changing it at any time, except when your own online times change.

     | Example
     | -------

       With regard to time zones now; this is a complicated topic, so I
       wish to express an example. Imagine a node in Indiana, USA. It is
       online for the
     | time period beginning 6 o'clock pm (1800) and ending 8 o'clock am
       (0800).  This changes with daylight saving time, so the times
       expressed effectively become an hour earlier with respect to GMT
       during daylight saving time.

       Indiana is in the Central time zone, which is 6 hours ahead of GMT.
     | Therefore, the online times in UTC can be expressed as 1200-0200 UTC
       during
     | winter. During daylight saving time, however, the local time for
       Indiana is
     | 5 hours ahead of UTC. The online times during this period are 1300-
       0300
     | UTC. The subset should be used, so that the online times flag for
       the node
     | should indicate availability between 1300 and 0200 GMT, which is
       indicated by the flag TNC.

     | ANSI C routines to Calculate the Online Times Flag
     | --------------------------------------------------

       These were not provided in the first edition. Change bars will not
       be used here, since they would interfere with the syntax of the
       presented routines.

       The first program calculates the online times flag from the user's
       entry of the online times of a system, expressed in the local time
       zone, and the offset to UTC used by the user's country. It takes
       into account that the clock is put forward and back once a year by
       reducing the end time by one hour. The program should work on any
     FIDONEWS 14-17               Page 22                  28 Apr 1997


       platform, and has been tested.

     === start of code ===
     /* TIMEFLAG.C
        Calculates FSC-0062 time flag requirement from user input */

     #include <stdio.h>

     char *onlineflag(char *on, char *off, int utc_diff);

     void main()
     {
        char on[6], off[6]; int utc_diff;

        printf("\nPlease specify the time you come online [HH:MM]: ");
        scanf("%s", on);
        printf("\nPlease specify the time you come offline [HH:MM]: ");
        scanf("%s", off);
        printf("\nSpecify the difference between your local time zone in
           winter\n" "time and UTC (e.g. if your time zone is 6 hours ahead
           of GMT,\n"
           "enter -6): ");
        scanf("%d", &utc_diff);
        printf("\nYour online time flag is %s\n\n",
           onlineflag(on, off, utc_diff));
     }

     char *onlineflag(char *ontime, char *offtime, int utcdiff)
     {
        int onhour, onmin, offhour, offmin;
        static char flag[4]="T  ";

        sscanf(ontime, "%d:%d", &onhour, &onmin);
        sscanf(offtime, "%d:%d", &offhour, &offmin);

        if(onmin>30) ++onhour;
        --offhour; /* to correct for daylight saving time */
        onhour = (onhour+24+utcdiff) % 24;
        offhour = (offhour+24+utcdiff) % 24;

        flag[1]='A'+onhour;
        flag[2]='A'+offhour;

        if(onmin>0 && onmin<31) flag[1] += 'a'-'A';
        if(offmin>29) flag[2] += 'a'-'A';

        return flag;
     }
     === end of code ===

       The second program calculates the online times from the time flag,
       input as a pointer to char to the routine (this being of the format
       "Txy"). It returns a pointer to a structure which contains the on-
       and off-times in UTC. This is not a complete program; it is designed
       to be used by mailers to determine the valid online times. It has
       also been tested.

     | Summary
     | -------

       I believe this to be a neat and compact solution to, what is in my
       opinion, one of the gravest problems currently facing FidoNet. In
       FidoNet, most nodes are continuous mail, but it is important for the
       growth and popularity of FidoNet that non-CM nodes do not receive
       many mailer calls at times when they are off line. Users are bad
       enough in this respect. It is also useful for people wishing to
       contact hubs that are non-CM with mail for a downlink, and for
       people wishing to file request from a node that is not CM. There is
       no need for systems that are only online in zone mail hour | to
       adopt this flag; also, there is no need for CM systems to adopt this
       flag.

     Status of this document:

             This FSC suggests a proposed protocol for the FidoNet(r)
             community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
             improvements.  Distribution of this document is unlimited.

             Software.

             I. Introduction

                  The current message strucures that are  transmitted
             between systems is fast becoming outdated.  Dupe checking,
             path checking, and zone aware routing are all areas of
             weekness in  the  current format.  This  proposal  both
             simplifies  the current processing needed of mail tossers,
             and eliminates the worst  problem  areas and limitations of
             the current methods.

                  Currently,  Seen-By  lines  and  Path lines are appended
             and maintained in all EchoMail type message sent into FidoNet
             technol-ogy networks.  The original intention of Seen-By's
             was  to  help eliminate  duplicate messages,  and give a sort
             of "tracking his-tory" of each piece of EchoMail.  Path lines
             tell us what systems have  actually  processed the mail and
             sent it on to another sys-tem, and offer some audit checking
             in case of problems.

     FIDONEWS 14-17               Page 25                  28 Apr 1997


                  Unfortunately,  these systems can not reliably detect
             and/or correct duplicate messges,  or point to the offending
             system with any surity. In recent times, a MSGID kludge has
             been used, requir-ing the maintaining of databases (one per
             echo usually)  to  test each message for duplication.  While
             this procedure cures much of the duplication problems,  it
             does nothing for the audit trail of each  message.  Further,
             it needlessly slows the tossing/packing process, and promotes
             disk fragmentation problems further.

                  Yet another consideration as we enter wider  acceptance
             and useage  of  our  electronic  media  is overhead.  Overhead
             can be viewed in many ways,  two of the most important are
             Cost per mes-sage  to transmit,  and disk space used for
             needless information.  The proposed changes outlined below
             address all  of  these  items and more, giving a means of
             expanding into the future.

             II. Proposed Changes

                  Seen-By lines will be greatly changed as compared to the
             cur-rent  structure,  Path  lines  will be eliminated,  and
             the MSGID kludge will also be eliminated.  Tear lines and
             origin lines will remain unchanged.  INTL kludges, FMPT
             kludges, and others will be eliminated.

                  This audit system is not new in concept.  In fact it is
             cur-rently used in a similar manner in the popular TICK and
             FLEA file echo processors.  Each system that processes a piece
             of mail adds its node number into an audit list.  The audit
             list is similar to current Seen-By's only in that node numbers
             are listed at the end of each message.

                  Node  numbers added to the audit list are FULL node
             numbers, ie.

             Zone:Net/Node.Point

                  A system ALWAYS adds itself to the  Audit  list,  but
             NEVER adds  any  other  system address to the list.  The mail
             processor must be capable of automatically zone matching its
             own  node  ad-dress to that of the system it is currently
             sending a message to.  For  example:  If I am sending an echo
             to zone 1 AND zone 42,  my mail processor would add the
             following Audit entries:

             For each zone 1 message:
             1:147/33.0
             For each zone 42 message:
             42:1036/33.0

                  My system then sends the message to the  correct
             receivers.  If  the receiver is at the end of a line (not
             sending the area to any other systems),  it simply checks the
             audit  list  to  ensure that the senders address is listed
             only once, and tosses that mes-sage to the correct area.
     FIDONEWS 14-17               Page 26                  28 Apr 1997


                  ONLY  SYSTEMS  THAT  RE-SEND A MESSAGE add themselves to
             the Audit list.  A system NEVER adds itself to the Audit list
             if  its sending system is listed more than once.  In this
             case,  the mes-sage is a duplicate, and is killed.

                  The Audit list is NEVER sorted,  or disturbed in any way
             ex-cept to add a new node to the end of the list.

                  There are no databases to maintain,  no path lines to
             check, and best of all,  only SENDING systems are  listed.  In
             national echos,  it is not uncommon to see 5 to 8 lines of
             Seen-By's and 2 or 3 path lines in EACH message.  Even though
             including the  full zone  address  (including points) adds to
             the length of node num-bers,  far fewer node numbers  are
             listed.  In  the  case  of  a problem,   the   offending
             system  can  be  quickly  and easily idetified, and the
             problem corrected.

                  Security is also enhanced by allowing the mail processor
             to check  the  sending  system against its send-to list in the
             areas file to determine that it was received from the correct
             node  ad-dress (the senders address can be cross checked by
             the Audit list as well as the packet header).

             III. Implementation

             A. Packet Header

                  The  current  packet  header  needs  no  changes (except
             the packet type identifier). This allows full backward
             compatibility.

             B. Packed Messages

                  No change to packed message structures or procedures.

             C. MSGID Line
                  Eliminated.

             D. Message Body

                  Unchanged.

             E. Tear Lines

                  Unchanged.

             F. Origin Lines

                  Unchanged.

             G. Seen-By's

                  Replaced by Audit list.  The Audit line begins with a
             unique tag:

     FIDONEWS 14-17               Page 27                  28 Apr 1997


             AUDIT:

             followed by a space (ASCII #32). Each node number is seperated
             by a  space.  Each Audit line is terminated by a carriage
             return and optionally a linefeed (ASCII #13 and #10).  The
             length of  each Audit  line  follows  current  Seen-By  line
             specifications  (79 characters).

                  Node numbers in the Audit list are full
             Zone:Net/Node.Point numbering. The maximum feild length per
             entry is 23 characters of text up to and including:

             65535:65535/65535.65535

             H. Path Lines

                  Eliminated.

             IV. Operations

             A. Sender

                  The originating system begins the Audit sequence by
             creating the  initial  Audit  line  and  adding  his node
             number after the AUDIT: tag.

             AUDIT: 1:147/33.0

                  Then packs the message to the receiving system  as  it
             normally would.

                  A  system  that  is  re-sending the message to other
             systems first completes the Receiver requirements in step B
             below.  Then the  system  adds  its own node number (zone
             matched) to the LAST Audit line of the message (or creates a
             new line if needed).  The sender then packs the message as it
             normally would.  This process is repeated for each message,
             and each system  that  recieves  a copy  of the message.  Zone
             gates may or may not be listed in the Audit list to correctly
             identify any problems (open to ruling).

             B. Receiver

                  Upon processing a packet,  the receiver scans for the
             Audit lines as it currently does for a Seen-By line for each
             message it processes.  Each  entry  in the Audit list is
             checked against the LAST entry, as well as its own address,
             for duplication. Addition-ally,  the LAST address is checked
             against the receivers list  of valid  systems  for  that
             message area to insure that security is not breeched.
             Optionally,  the receiver may check the address of the  packet
             header against that of the senders Audit entry to en-sure
             correct addressing.

                  After all tests are made,  the message is tossed to the
             cor-rect message area.  If the receiver is to send the message
     FIDONEWS 14-17               Page 28                  28 Apr 1997


             to any other systems, it then becomes the sender and procedes
             as in step A above.

             V. Qualifications

                  I am a programmer by trade,  and hold a degree in
             Electronic Engineering.  I attended Oklahoma State University,
             and MIT. I am the author of the SuperComm bulletin board
             system which includes:

             SCBBS     The BBS program
             SCMAIL    The Mail processor
             SCED      The offline Message editor
             SCSET     Set-up utility
             SCNET     Network interface (Front-end mailer).

                  The SuperComm system holds a current FidoNet  product
             code, and  is fully compliant in its mail handling.  A working
             model of ScMail including these changes is available  for
             review.  Source code ideas are also available for the proposed
             changes, either in C or Turbo Pascal.

     --- Following message extracted from NETMAIL @ 1:18/14 ---
         By Christopher Baker on Tue Apr 22 04:04:39 1997

     From: Stephen Reinen @ 1:107/700
     To: Editor @ 1:1/23
     Date: 21 Apr 97  19:24:18
     Subj: 1:13/10

     Chris,

         I am sending you this note to you as a progress update for the re-
     building of 13/10.  You have my permission to re-print this in
     Fidonews, and in the Echos.

         I will try to send you updates weekly as things progress.

         I spoke with Burt Juda last week, he is working on the
     configuration files.  The configurations for IEEE were very complex
     and specific to that installation.  Burt plans to send me the
     configurations and utilities on diskette, this should make things
     easier for the installation on to my server.

         In the mean time, I am working on the interface configuration to
     the EMSI mailer.  I hope to provide FTP access to allow outgoing mail
     to enter the gate.

         Initially, the I/O gate will only support the gating on netmail.
     We hope to be able to resume UseNet capabilities eventually.
     Currently 13/10 will be operating on limited bandwidth (56k).  I have
     obtained permission to install a server on the LAN at the ISP.  When
     this machine is built, we should ba able
     to bring 13/10 back to where it was.

                                         - Stephen

          IMPORTANT LAWSUIT-AVOIDING DISCLAIMER-TYPE NOTICE:

     The following list is a comedic look at the book, "Dianetics",
     and its author, the world-renowned, highly-esteemed, late
     science fiction writer/adventurer/yachtsman/horticulturist
     L. Ron Hubbard.  In it we stretch the truth, bend the facts,
     and probably even make up some stuff.  Nothing you read here
     should be taken seriously.  I'm sure the Scientologists are
     fine people.  Okay, I'm not *really* sure, but there's always
     the remote chance that they're fine people, isn't there?
     Regardless, we don't want them suing us (not that they're
     famous for doing that or anything), so don't believe anything
     you read here.  Just laugh at it, then go back to your jobs.

     New PC Virus Discovered By ZDNet

                Symantec and Dr Solomon Patches Available Exclusively
                      on the Web at ZDNet Software Library Site

         CAMBRIDGE, Mass., April 25 /PRNewswire/ -- Software experts at
     ZDNet, the Web's undisputed source for computing and Internet
     information, today announced the discovery of, and cure for, a
     previously unknown and undetectable computer virus that can destroy
     many of the most common types of PC files. ZDNet's technical experts
     worked with leading anti-virus utility providers Symantec (Nasdaq:
     SYMC) and Dr Solomon's Software (Nasdaq: SOLLY) to successfully
     develop software patches for the new virus.  Both patches are
     available via free download exclusively at the ZDNet Software Library
      (http://www.hotfiles.com).
         The new virus, which is referred to as the 'HLL.5850A' virus by Dr
     Solomon's and 'Weed.5850' virus by Symantec, encrypts and corrupts
     '.com' and '.exe' files on personal computers.  ZDNet discovered the
     virus during a routine virus check performed on all files before the
     files are uploaded to the Software Library, a ZDNet channel.  ZDNet
     contacted Dr Solomon's Software and Symantec, two of the leading anti-
     virus and utilities providers, for assistance in detecting and
     repairing the virus.
         "Our colleagues at Symantec and Dr Solomon's were exemplary for
     the speed in which they were able to identify and rectify this
     previously undiscovered virus," said Preston Gralla, executive editor
     in charge of the ZDNet Software Library.  "We're proud to offer a
     quick remedy for the virus, saving PC users the possible agony of
     having to replace large amounts of corrupted data.  This is yet
     another exclusive offer available at the Software Library site."
         PC users can download free virus protection patch files for
     Symantec's Norton Anti-Virus and Dr Solomon's FindVirus, the scanner
     found in Dr Solomon's entire line of anti-virus products.  Evaluation
     copies of the latest versions of Norton Anti-Virus and FindVirus are
     also available for download at the Software Library Web site.
         "After ZDNet alerted us to this new virus threat, the Symantec
     Anti-Virus Research Center team sprung into action.  The minute we
     FIDONEWS 14-17               Page 36                  28 Apr 1997


     received the virus sample from ZDNet, our researchers jumped on the
     problem and provided a detection and repair solution to ZDNet on the
     same day,"  said Alex Haddox, product manager for Symantec Anti-Virus
     Research Center (SARC).  "This fast response proves Symantec's
     commitment to protecting computer users and, exemplifies how SARC
     protection extends beyond the Symantec AntiVirus product line, by also
     protecting our partner, ZDNet, and its users."
         "When ZDNet reported files were increasing in size, we immediately
     suspected a computer virus.  Within two hours, we provided ZDNet the
     means to ensure the integrity of their data," said Shane Coursen,
     senior technology consultant at Dr Solomon's Software.  "With more
     than 200 new viruses appearing every month, Dr Solomon's Software's
     technology experts are always on alert to deliver this type of
     resolution.  Our combined effort demonstrates the value of cooperation
     among the leading anti-virus experts to provide the highest level of
     protection to all computer users."
