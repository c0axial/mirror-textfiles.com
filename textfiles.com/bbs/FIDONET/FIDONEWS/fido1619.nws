     Greetings,

     I've never been involded or for that matter, seen a twister.  The
     movie I've seen yes.  Hence my sympathies to those who lost a love
     one in last weeks twister(s) in Zone 1.

     Another 2 weeks and I'll be spending a well earned rest in Zone 2.
     During those two weeks, Douglas Myers will be caretaker of the snooze
     and I thank him for assisting me in being able to get a break.

     Please, if your article does not happen to appear in the snooze during
     that time, please be patient as it will, I'm sure on my return.

     Happy reading,

     Top-Down Organization
                        What is Fido's true structure?
                        Douglas Myers        1:270/720

     The bad news is that the Zone 1 Coordinator election process
     appeared to be stalled.  The good news is that Andrea Santos'
     probing questions have elicited sincere discussions in the Z1C echo
     from at least two Regional Coordinators.  The bad news is that there
     is still no firm schedule nor details concerning the election
     available.  The good news is that the consensus is that the election
     won't "fall through the cracks."

     An sidebar to the conversation caught my attention, and seemed to me
     to have more significance than the timing of the election.  I was,
     at first, appalled when Dallas Hinton - himself a likely candidate
     for the Z1C slot - mentioned that the identity of the Z1C was of
     little significance to the "average node."  It was hard to fault
     what he actually said... he was just pointing out that most Fido
     nodes won't be adversely affected if it takes a little time to
     select a new ZC... but my first reaction was that the statement
     smacked of elitism.

     Upon further reflection, though, his view of the "average node" is
     totally consistent with the view of Fidonet as a "top-down"
     structure.  The "top-down" view assumes that most of the authority
     is concentrated in the top positions.  Contrast this to the
     viewpoint of many of the individuals who feel that Fidonet should be
     democratized - essentially a "bottom-up" structure.  How did we come
     to hold these two viewpoints of Fido?

     Ironically, many in Fido hole both viewpoints simultaneously.  I've
     often wondered how the same people who expect coordinators to act as
     mere nodelist clerks will also blame them for a lack of leadership.
     We, as a net, seem to want democracy simultaneously with strong
     central authority.

     The next Zone Coordinator will face a truly daunting task - he'll
     face twin demands to dispatch issues with the strong resolution
     usually found only in tyrants, and yet be called upon to determine
     and act upon the consensus of those vaguely-defined "average nodes."
     The next Zone Coordinator is best advised to get to know these
     "average nodes," for he'll find that he can only derive power from
     the Regional Coordinators who select him.  True authority must come
     from the "average nodes," whether they're paying attention or not.

     Fidonet-TNG: Where do we go from here?
     by Larry Cody
     Fidonet: 1:133/504
     Email: lcody@asnbbs.com
     WWW: bbs.asnbbs.com

     In the section ECHO TALK of Fidonews 16-18 (3 May 1999), an unnamed
     author made these comments in reference to the future of Fido:

     "The people of Fidonet have been very clever about connecting through
     the Internet... but most of our effort has been bent to connecting
     to each other in support of the traditional dial-up BBS.  Now we
     need to direct our efforts to connecting to the _people_.  Fido of
     the (near) future needs to be just a mouse-click away."

     The author of these words is absolutely correct... Fidonet has always
     been about connecting to people, whether through the echoes a system
     carried, the files the Sysop made available, or the general air of
     the BBS.

     As the modem-using community turns increasingly towards the Internet,
     so Fidonet BBSes must also turn in that direction. Should we fail to
     do so, continued decline and eventual extinction is the most probable
     end. But there is an answer, available now, to at least part of the
     problem. Many Fidonet BBSes are already on the Internet. Through the
     use of software platforms which enable either Telnet or HTML
     connections, Fidonet remains accessible to the masses. The message
     areas can be HTML pages or text-only, but either way, they are there
     for the newcomer to read. However, access is not sufficient to ensure
     Fidonet's future. As any good marketer knows, to create a need for a
     product or service, one must create a desire for such. In order to
     create a "desire" for visiting a Fidonet BBS, we have to ensure that
     the user who stumbles into that system encounters something that
     brings them back.

     One possible solution lies in our past...

     Fidonet Sysops once had a tradition of helping others. How many of
     us owe our very existence to another Sysop who had a patient ear
     (and a handy telephone) to walk us through setting up this or that?
     How many BBSes started because a Sysop had a (C)hat option and then
     used it, perhaps to answer a few questions on how to start a BBS? We
     must rediscover that tradition. A number of BBSes participate in
     various Webrings, connecting Internet-accessible BBSes to each other.
     Other boards already offer Telnet links between BBSes for Internet
     use. Those boards provide an entry point for the Internet-bound.
     Links to non-Internet BBSes can be carried as free advertisements
     (time to dig out the old ANSI logoff screens). Perhaps others know
     of an ISP or business who may provide resources to put a BBS on the
     'net. Who knows? The IT manager at that local business may have
     gotten his or her start as a kid on a local Fidonet BBS.
     FIDONEWS 16-19               Page 4                   10 May 1999


     To reiterate the earlier point: Fidonet needs to connect to people.
     To do this, we need exposure... and that means advertising and
     marketing. The best advertising is often word-of-mouth. Those of
     you on the Internet, get the word out that Fido still exists. Join or
     create Webrings, advertise your fellow boards, meet the people in
     your community who may be able to help. Patronize your fellow boards
     and encourage the users you DO have to do the same. Above all, lend
     a helping hand to those who are struggling... either to stay or to
     join Fidonet.

     This is where Fidonet excels, where we have room to carve out a
     niche. Use technology to get them in the door, then keep them
     coming back because of the Sysop, not the system. Put that (C)hat
     command back on the menu and use it from time to time. Who knows?
     You may even bring some of the fun back to this old hobby of ours.

     Latest Greatest Software Versions
     by Peter E. Popovich, 1:228/158

     Well, it has been quite a while. Been wondering if I should come
     back. Guess I just did. <grin>

     Everything is out of date. I've got a backlog, but while I catch
     up on old mail, I also want to get new mail as well. So write me.

     There's been some speculation about web page listings and e-mail
     addresses for this list. I do plan to add them to the web version
     of this list within the next couple of weeks. Please send them in.

     Please note the new contact info:
