   With International women's week coming up, Max is up to her
eyeballs in getting ready for an art show.  So her I am, stuck
with the editorial.

   The snooze is relatively tame this week, with only one
article chastising us for content.  As Max went out the door,
she said "I want to reply to that ... next week".  So that will
have to wait.

   A couple of new networks are announced; one in Britain and
one down in Florida.  I could never quite figure out why Florida
is such a hotbed of BBS activety.  I mean, up here in Canada it
is so cold all winter that we woosies need an indoor activety
all winter.  But down there it is WARM.  Why all the indoor
stuff?  MMM.  Applies to California as well, I suppose.

   Anyway, here is the snooze.  I am going to head out to the
gallery and give Max a hand hanging stuff.

Unnecessary Expletives.

    I was reading the February 21, 1994 (Vol 11 No 8) edition
of Fidonews and was shocked to see the use of an inflammatory
word in the editorial.  If you're wondering what word, go back
and read it for yourself.  There are many young users who read
Fidonews.  I've always enjoyed reading Fidonews, but this type
of language is totally unnecessary.  On our board, we try to
maintain a family type atmosphere and when a young user or
anyone else can go to the bulletin menu and read this type of
trash does not give Fidonet and the BBS community a very good
image.  I hope that in the future that the editors will delete
these unnecessary expletives.

Mercury Network
by Nick Jay 2:441/6

As a regular reader of the 'Snooze' for about 6 months now, and
having seen several articles over a period informing everyone
about OTHERNETS, I'd just like to take this opportunity to tell
everyone about a great 'new' network that is in operation here
in the UK. It's called Mercury and has nothing to do with the
telco of the same It was originally set up by Steve Woodmore, a
FidoNet SysOp, in order to create a network that was both
friendly, free of politics and policies and one that would give
people total freedom of comms, choice of conversations, topics
and expression.
FidoNews 11-10                 Page:  3                    07 Mar 1994


It started small but now has almost 200 participating nodes in
the UK alone. There are also many other users and points and the
network has grown in size and scope ever since. There are
currently around 150 echoes, catering to all needs and although
some of them are currently being dropped through lack of
participation, others are being imported from the States to
replace these, via the VNet/VBBS network in the USA and Canada.
A new RC in the Netherlands/Holland has also recently joined
With spain, Germany and France to follow soon. it is hoped that
this will continue to expand  and  encompass  even  more
international  countries than are already contributing and
enjoying the network.

As you can see, there are many varied echoes available and
something to interest everyone. The adult areas are limited but
are also strictly controlled so that only people *known* to be
over the age of 18 are allowed access to them and are also
moderated by VNet/VBBS from where they are imported. There are
other echoes being added all the time, one of the latest being
FidoNews 11-10                 Page:  6                    07 Mar 1994

my own M_PRISONER echo which aids discussions on the television
programme of The Prisoner, that starred Patrick McGoohan and is
so popular on both sides of the Atlantic.

People are able to start their own echoes if there is a topic
that isn't already available and these can be UK only areas or
internationally gated, as the person wishing to start it so
desires. We allow psudonyms or handles in *all* the echoes and
hi-Ascii, Ansi and sigs are also freely allowed, subject to
reasonable limitations of course.

There are no rules and no official policies although, of course,
like *all* networks, there have to be guidelines that need to be
adhered to in order for things to run smoothly but they're
extremely easy and very

As I write, Mercury is looking for a Regional Co-ordinator from
America and/or Canada to start feeding directly from Steve in
England. They will have *full* administrative leeway to run
their side of things totally as they wish with no interference
from anyone else, subject of course to the guidelines. They
would be expected to run .FTN software and to poll the UK
perhaps 3 times a week to exchange mail. If you are interested
or would like any further information or details, or may even
know someone suitable, then please contact either Steve Woodmore
(2:440/410) or myself. I'm sure Steve would be most grateful to
hear from you. I know I would. :-)

Thank you kindly for your attention.
Be Seeing You!!

Small Article about swiscon/eurocon
   From: Ruedi Kneubuehler (2:301/520)

    Dear Fidonetter,

    as  you  might  know,  the  next  CON will be held in Switzerland,
    therefore  called  SWISSCON/EUROCON.

    The  same  procedure  as  every year, we are looking for speakers.
    We  are  interested  to  have speakers, that can tell us something
    about   new   technologies   that  could  be  implemented  whithin
    FidoNet.  We  think,  that a lot of fellow sysop are interested in
    knowing  how  the  future  could  be.
    That  can  be:

    How  does  Usenet  News  transport work, would it be a benefit for
    FidoNet,  to  use that method of transfering and distributing huge
    Echomailpackets.

    Any  other  not  yet  known Method, how to transfer and distribute
FidoNews 11-10                 Page:  7                    07 Mar 1994

    huge mailtraffic.

    New  packetproposals,  that solves all outstanding problems in one
    stroke.

    New   transferprotocols   that   uses   both   channels  for  ISDN
    connections  or  any  kind of TCP/IP over seriallines or any other
    brandnew invention.

    If  you  have  special  knowledge  in  such  technologies  and are
    willing   to   be   speaker,   please  send  a  netmail  to  Ruedi
    Kneubuehler 2:301/520 or pingu@chg.imp.com, describing your topic.

    Any  other  question concerning SWISSCON/EUROCON, can be routed to
    2:2/1994.

    Hope  to  see a lot of you in switzerland joining the SWISSCON, we
    will have a lot of fun... :-))

    Thanks for taking time and reading this Mail.

Dying Boy Needs Cards ... NOT!

Introduced by:
Canadian Hoax Interception Project (CHIP) @ 1:250/730

Following up on the "Make Hoaxes Fast" of FNews v11#9, it should be
noted for the record that the disease young Craig Shergold had was
misidentified in that article. CHIP regrets the incorrect detail,
although the general story is there.

"Make Hoaxes Fast" (with correction made) is available for file
request at 1:250/730 under the file HOAX.ART, for future reference.

Here is a Usenet posting that explains the Craig Shergold story in
good detail. Please pass this along wherever hoaxes can happen:

From: spaf@cs.purdue.edu (Gene Spafford)
Newsgroups: news.announce.important
Subject: DO NOT SENT ANY {GET WELL, POST, BUSINESS} CARDS TO CRAIG
SHERGOLD!
Date: 17 Feb 92 19:43:21 GMT
Organization: SERC, Department of Computer Sciences, Purdue Univ.

If you call the ``Children's Make a Wish'' foundation, you will find
that they are not soliciting any form of card for Craig Shergold or
anyone else.  Better yet, if you call the Guinness people (US
publisher is "Facts on File" @ 212-683--2244 ext. 336), you can get
this same story confirmed.  You will also find that they will no
longer endorse or support any effort to break this record.

Many years ago, Craig Shergold had a brain tumor, believed inoperable.
He sought to set the Guinness record for get-well cards.  The call was
well-publicized, and he did, indeed set the record (consult a recent
edition of the book --- he has received in excess of 16 million cards
to date; he officially set the record as of 17 Nov 1989).

As part of this whole story, his plight caught the attention of John
Kluge, the US billionaire, who paid for Craig to come to the US and
receive specialized treatment.  As a result, Craig has recovered
completely from his tumor.  He is also no longer seven, but well into
his teens (you can see how out-of-date the request for cards is from
this -- it's like circulating a letter encouraging people to vote for
Carter for President).

The problem is that the mimeographed sheets and letters seeking cards
for Craig have continued to be circulated.  As a result, cards
continue to pour in to the post office for Royal Marsden Hospital in
England.  Worse, the appeal has mutated into various other versions,
such as an appeal for business cards, one for postcards, and another
version that appeals for holiday cards.

The Shergold family has publicly appealed many times that people cease
to mail them cards and letters, and that no more appeals be made on
their behalf. One easily accessible way to verify this is with the
article on page 24 of the 19 July 1990 NY Times.  People Magazine wrote
an article about it on June 1, 1991, page 63.  Even Ann Landers has
carried an item on this [6/23/91], but people still keep trying to send
cards.  Both Guinness and Royal Marsden have repeatedly issued press
releases asking people to stop circulating requests for cards, as they
are creating an undue burden on both the hospital and the postal
service.

The Guinness people have discontinued the category to prevent this
kind of thing from ever happening again, and are doing their utmost to
kill any further mailings.  The Royal Marsden Hospital is at a loss
what to do with the cards that continue to arrive --- most are being
sold to stamp collectors and paper recyclers, and none go on to Craig.

This appeal for Craig, as well as many urban legends, regularly appear
FidoNews 11-10                 Page:  9                    07 Mar 1994

on electronic bulletin boards around the world, and in many
organizational newsletters and bulletins.  It is both heartening and
unfortunate that there are so many well-meaning people who continue to
propagate these stories.  It is too bad that so many people are
unwilling to verify their information before passing such things
along, especially when a simple phone call will suffice to do so.  In
this case, opening a recent copy of a book carried by nearly every
library and bookstore would illuminate the situation.

If you would still like to do something for a dying child, consider
making a donation to a charity such as UNICEF or to the International
Red Cross (Red Crescent, Red Magen David).  Many thousands of children
are dying daily around the world from disease and starvation, and
countless millions more are suffering from the ravages of war, famine,
disease, and natural disaster.  Think how many of them might be helped
by the millions of dollars in postage spent on cards to Craig
Shergold....   Addresses (in US) are:

        UNICEF               American National Red Cross
        1 UN Plaza           17th & D Streets
        New York, NY 10017   Washington, DC 20006
                             Attn: international children's aid

[Also, I encourage you to save this announcement, in either electronic
or hard copy form, and to post it to any bulletin board you've seen the
original plea on.  If you see it in the future, as you probably will,
you can attach a copy of this announcement.  Wouldn't it be great to
finally kill this story, which spreads like a virus?]
