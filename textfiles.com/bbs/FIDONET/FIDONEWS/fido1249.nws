Redundant Nodelist Flags?

In the interest of pruning the size of the Nodelist, why don't we drop
the use of V32B,V42B flags when either V34 or VFC are listed?
     Just curious.... Richard Ratledge 1:119/88

Where do you  get  off  disbanding  an  ENTIRE  network  without
telling anyone about it?

Steve  Baumann  was  at  my house last night.  We both talked to
Kelly Garnett by voice.  NONE of us knew anything about this.

Accordingly, we wish to form a new network.  We have met all the
requirements  of  Section  2.4  of  Policy  4.07.   Here  is the
nodelist segment.  It's also file attached as NET2805.342.

Seeking Nodelist Archives
by Richard Bash

A colleague asked me for the location of archives of old
nodelists/nodediffs. That put me "on the chase," so to speak. I am
seeking a collection of nodediffs for 1989. I tried George Peace's
location. He only has stuff for the past 30 days there.

Is there a site (ideally an Internet site where I can ftp the files,
but a Fido node is great as well) where these older nodediffs are
archived? With the great variety of folks we have worldwide in Fidonet,
I'm sort of surprised that someone hasn't taken it upon themselves to
create such a collection.

I welcome your suggestions. Please contact me by netmail or Internet
e-mail at the addresses below or post an article here and let the world
know where these archives, if they exist, are maintained. Thank you.

The CHAMELEON Echo Lives
Exotic Pets Chatter Echo is BACK!
By Bill Myers, 1:366/27 (COPS-N-HAMS BBS)

As many of you owners of exotic pets read in FIDO1246, our CHAMELEON
echo was dropped from the Backbone on 01 Nov.

I was able to make contact with the previous moderator through his
SYSop, and he has agreed to allow me to take over moderatorship of
the echo.  It has been re-Elisted and should be back on the Backbone
on/about 1 Dec.

To those of you that aren't familiar with the echo, allow me to
invite you to drop in and visit.  This echo is for the pets that
aren't allowed in other pet echo's; Iguanas, Monitors, Tegus, Water
Dragons, Chameleons, Snakes, Turtles, Spiders, Ferrets, Insects,
and many more.  Discussions are lively and lots of good information
is passed out, much based on ownership and experience.  A lot of
questions are answered for people thinking about buying one of these
pets.

To the old members of the echo, look for it in the 1 Dec BACKBONE.NA
and I'm looking forward to chatting with you folks again.

Take Care and Happy Holidays to All

Invitation to MirageNet!
From: Mark Hoover (1:275/103)

I'm writing this in light of the responses I received from
FidoNews edition number 47. I was surprised from the response I
recieved after it was released as I had no idea how many people
actually read this.

I would like to invite everybody who is reading this to join
MirageNet. We consist of 36 active bases ranging from general
chatter to the unexplained to fantasy and anything else you can
imagine. MirageNet is also hosting InterBBS games of Bre,
Falcon's Eye, and Lord.

MirageNet currently has nodes in eight states and one province,
so there should be a node near you. I have provided a list of
names and phone numbers where the welcome packet is available
and the Freq name where available.
