     Announcing a new Computer Magazine


     I would like to take this opportunity to let the world know that
     there is soon to be an exciting new magazine in San Diego.  It is
     so new that it doesn't even have a name yet.  Oh, we've toyed
     with a few ideas, and I'm sure one will land on it soon, but for
     now we just want to let you know what is happening and see if you
     would like to be involved.

     Our goal is to be a free, locally run, news magazine for the
     computing community, available at computer stores, electronically,
     at local libraries and, frankly, anywhere else where someone will
     put us on their counter, in front of their store, on the hood of
     their car...

     We would like to have the standard assortment of reading fare:
     Columns dealing with specific computers;  Q & A;  an extensive BBS
     list as well as an "on-line" column;  information about user
     groups;  cartoons;  informative, educational and humorous articles
     on any computer-related subject.

     So there it is, an invitation to be part of a new magazine right
     from the start.  You don't have to live in San Diego to be a part
     of it, you just have to have something that would be of interest
     to our readers.  Any submission you may deem appropriate will be
     reviewed and will more than likely get in, as our requirements
     are pretty much "if you write it, we'll print it." *

             * That is, if it makes sense to SOMEBODY! :-) *

     If you are, or would like to be, a writer or cartoonist,  send
     us an example of your work.  Be warned it may get used, so send
     only things you would like to have included.

     If you have a BBS send us your information. Name, number, hours,
     baud rates etc.  If you have or belong to a user group send us
     your information.

     If you have any advice for us (good or bad) send it along.
     If you think we're nuts... let us know.
     If you're nuts... let us know.

     We're pretty flexible in Net105; if _this_ works, we may even consider
     hosting FidoCon '91!  Meanwhile, here's our loose agenda for R17Con

     R17 Echomail: Philosophy, Procedures, and Funding
       As echomail is always a prominent topic, and we have had a
       recent scare or two, it is worth discussing the philosophy,
       procedures, and economics of how we move echomail within the
       region.

     Diskette Throwing Contest
       This traditional hotly contested event will have to be
       scheduled on an ad hoc basis, as the Columbia Gorge, though
       beautiful, has frequent winds.  Please remember that diskettes
       must be unaltered 5.25" disks, and accuracy is more important
       than distance.

     Dweeb Throwing Contest
       This new continuous event is open to both team and individual
       players, but no points are awarded unless you can provoke the
       dweeb into posting at least one embarrassingly inept echomail
       flame first.

                          --------------------------

     After much Net-1:105 and Region-1:17 discussion, it was agreed
     to hold this meeting at Menucha, despite the restriction that no
     drop-in attendees would be possible.  It was felt that Menucha's
     great facilities and scandalously low prices (you can do the
     entire meeting for about $75 including meals and accommodation!)
     were worth this retriction.

     This means that cruising up for the afternoon will not work.
     You either register for the meeting (one and two day plans are
     available), or "it's tough tamales."

     * Software Review: Save the Planet

     Software Review: Save the Planet
     By Kevin Johnson, 141/552.2


        This is my first fidonews article, so you'll have to bear
     with me if it isn't perfect.

        A while ago, I ran across a piece of software that I thought
     was worth telling others about.  I found the software on my
     boss node, 1:141/552.0.  It's available there for file-request
     or download if you're interested, and I'm sure it's on dozens
     of other BBS's across the country.

        The program was called _Save the Planet_ and it bills itself
     as an "Environmental Database on Global Warming and Ozone
     Depletion."  It is all that and more!

        It is written by Roger & Kathy Cox of Pitkin, Colorado.  For
     this article all the usual disclaimers apply: I don't work for
     them, we don't own stock in some joint company, et cetera, et
     cetera.  And please don't let my lack of writing skills reflect
     on the program.  I just want to tell you all about this fine
     piece of shareware software called _Save the Planet_.

        Save the Planet (hereby referred to as STP) is "green"
     software.  It is designed to inform people about the
     environment in a truly innovative way.

        The program runs on any sort of monitor, it worked just fine
     on my CGA setup, and it'll run on anything from monochrome to
     the best VGA displays.  It requires 512k of RAM.  The program
     opens with a title screen and it shows a computer simulation
     of the growth of the hole in the ozone layer in Antarctica from
     1985-1987.  Seeing this graphically is really shocking.  That
     hole's definitely gotten much bigger in two years!

        On the main menu of STP it displays lettered options for all
     of the program's choices.  The main menu is divided into two
     categories, "Looking at the problem" and "Taking action to
     solve it."

        Under "Looking at the problem" it explains what global
     warming is and about things such as CFC's and most of the
     other environmental buzzwords that you hear.  Included in
     the explanations are graphs of different things.  There's such
     things as a list of books you can read for more information and
     much, much more.  There's even a "game" (if you could call
     something so serious a game - the program calls it that so
     that's what I'll call it too) or a model of how the earth will
     be effected by reducing or not reducing carbon dioxide
     emissions over the next 50 years.  The game lets you see what
     will happen if we choose not to reduce carbon dioxide emissions
     or what will happen at various levels of reduction.

        On the "Taking action to solve it" side of the menu, there
     is really some good stuff.  Included here is a complete
     database of how every one of our congresspersons voted on
     environmental matters.  You can look up to see how your Senator
     and/or Congressperson voted.  Included also is a listing of
     various environmental groups -- both major and minor -- and
     their particular areas of interest, if they have any.  There's
     also a mini-word processor to write your congressperson a
     letter telling them how you feel about the environment.
     There's sections on things like tips on how you can save
     energy, learn about recycling, be a more envionmental-concious
     consumer and much, much more.

        The program is really well done and all data in the program
     are from established sources.  I've barely scratched the
     surface of what is available in the program, but hopefully it
     is enough to make you want to see what the program really has
     to offer.  For such an important topic this program does a fine
     job of educating people about what is at stake if we do not
     get serious about protecting our environment and changing our
     lifestyles to become more environmentally-concious.

        Look for Save the Planet on your local bulletin board, I
     found version 1.14 as STP.ZIP and the archive was 188k.  Or
     you may reach the authors at:

     Save the Planet Shareware
     P.O. Box 45
     Pitkin, CO 81241
     (303) 641-5035

        The registration for the program is $15 which includes a
     free updated version which will come out after the fall
     elections.  A Macintosh version is supposed to be released
     this summer.

     =================================================================
                                  COLUMNS
     =================================================================

     Henry Clark
     124/6120


     I'll Go Long and You Fake It To Me --

     My favorite computer store has a 14 day money back guarantee.
     I go there 26 times a year !

     So Friday afternoon, I was in there returning a 286 clone.
     Some kind of goofy VLSI chip on the motherboard was trying to
     do EVERYTHING, and was latching the IRQ I needed, even though
     I'd clearly set the 'disable' jumper correctly.

     Those VLSI chips are neat, until you realize that if it goes
     bad, well forget the whole motherboard, it's worthless. Give me
     everything on the slot cards and socketed chips as well.  But
     then, that's another CAT FIGHT.

     I picked out a slightly more reasonable 286 clone, for slightly
     more money, and cruised through the rest of the store on the
     way to the cashier.

     'Honey Interrupt' :  Oh, I see, you'll shop the computer store,
     but you won't shop for shoes with me.  Hmmph !


     He's at Midfield --

     So anyways, I see this Hand SCANNER/OCR package sitting right
     there.  Shoot, there's dozens of them.  I grab it, pay for it (
     and the new clone ), and head on home.  I've been looking for
     this for weeks.

     Later that evening, I'm plugging in the bus card, and checking
     it all out, when young Kevin ( the Asst-sysop ) just sort of
     APPEARS.  Like from out of no where.  I start the DOS scanner
     program, and pull the scanner across a color photo of him.
     First scan, perfect, and his jaw drops off watching his FACE
     scroll onto the screen.

     You could see his little four year old muscles start twitching;
     hear his brain cells whirring, trying to figure a way to get at
     this 'toy' without getting Dad all riled up about breakage,
     dirt, expense, you know, all the things that keep him from
     playing with everything else I own.

     FidoNews 7-28                Page 15                   9 Jul 1990


     'Honey Interrupt' : ( Also appearing out of no where. ) So, how
     much did it cost ?

     So next I set up the paint/scan program and he recognizes the
     'paint game' immediately.  I started scanning another picture
     of him into the paint program window, and then :  QEMM
     EXCEPTION !  SET DMA=91.

     These are the absolute worst kinds of problems.  No not the
     software, the anxious kid in your face who wants to know when
     if it's fixed after every keystroke. A quick look at the
     Desqview book, and VIOLA : set the DMA buffer smaller. I went
     ahead and set it to 64 (k) in case Binkley decides to pull a
     fancy swap move.


     He's at The Goal Box --

     Well finally, I get back to the paint program, and hand it over
     to Mr. Hopping With Delight.  When he gets going, I just get
     out.

     'Honey Interrupt' :  Want to see what *I* bought today ?

     Sure, I say.  Out comes some new boots.  New Cowgirl boots at
     that. New Nieman Marcus Cowgirl boots.  ( Hey wait a second. )
     New Lizard-skin Nieman Marcus ITALIAN Cowgirl boots.  Groan.
     How much did those cost ?

     She: How much did your new computer toy cost ?

     So you're thinking "Why did he buy a 286 ?"  You're just like
     the damn salesmen at the store.  I'm gonna make a ROCK VIDEO,
     all right?.  In the final scene, we pour gasoline on it and it
     goes up in a huge fireball. OK, man ?  Where's your 20 inch
     monitors?

     The truth is even better.  I'm selling a turnkey system to a
     big giant corporation and the order calls for an AT compatible,
     color monitor and 80 meg hard disk.  So an AT is a 286.  I did
     get a nice VGA package, though.  Could'a stiffed them with CGA,
     but hey, I'm a nice guy.  I used the starch sparingly.


     It's a Shot on Goal --

     So in comes the 'Scan Master' with a piece of printer paper.
     Where did you learn to print ?  It's the button next to the
     Coke can, Dad.  ( What Coke can ? )

     I look at the paper, and there *I* am, with a scary hairdo,
     eyes like dead cartoon characters ( x x ), a huge beard and
     some kind of arrow/stick which appears to have entered at the
     back of my neck and come out through my stomach. When FIDONEWS
     goes graphic, I'll send it to ya.

     Finally, he get's off to bed, and I get to play with the OCR.
     It works !  It's actually pretty good at recognizing
     characters.  This program does not use specific font matching,
     so you don't get to 'train' the recognition function.  The
     post-match routine just gives you a picture of the unrecognized
     character ( usually two characters stuck together ), and you
     type in the two characters, or whatever it takes.

     I'm a real fast typist, and I believe I can get about two times
     that character rate per minute using the
     scan/recognize/correction cycle.  I can't wait to use the
     pictures in some desktop publishing.

     'Honey Interrupt' : When are you coming to bed ?

     Me : Are you going to wear your new boots ?
     Her: Are you going to look at your computer all night ?
     Me : I'll turn off the computer if you take off the boots.
     Her: I'll take back the boots if you take back the computer.
     Me : OK.

     It's Wide ! Wait, there's a red card...

                            New NUTRITION Echo

     The OpLine  BBS / Health and Nutrition Opinion Line at 1:11/15 in
     Evansville, IN.   is  sponsoring  a  new  NUTRITION  Echo.    The
     Conference Moderator is Harvey  Wyche.  Messages on the NUTRITION
     Echo deal with food and  nutrition  issues as they relate to good
     health.

     NUTRITION functions as an open forum  for the expression of ideas
     and opinions as well as the exchange  of  news  and helpful hints
     about nutrition and diet.  The Echo is  not  part  of  any  diet,
     weight loss center, or nutritional program.  One of  the  special
     features of the Echo is the weekly posting of requested  Nutrient
     Analyses of common foods (including many fast food items).

     David Dodell at St.  Joes Hospital at 1:114/15 has offered to act
     as HUB for the NUTRITION Echo.  If you would like to  participate
     in  the  Echo,  please contact me via netmail at 1:11/15.  I will
     advise you  as  to  when  the  feed  for  your  system  has  been
     activated.

     Your participation is  most  welcome.  We look forward to hearing
     from you within the Echo.  Thank you.

     Harvey...
