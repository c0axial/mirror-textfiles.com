                        Whiz Kids and Communications
                            by Richard P. Wilkes

     During the past eight years,  I have been heavily  involved  with
     "bulletin  board"  systems running on micros and mainframes.  I'd
     like to give a few examples of the  destructiveness  of  many  of
     these "kids."

     Most  have probably heard of or called an RCP/M.  Five years ago,
     I wrote a similar type system for a  TRS-80.  This  software  ran
     for  3.5  years  without  a  problem.  But now,  as more and more
     potential crackers have access to communications equipment,  this
     system has been crashed repeatedly.

     When  I was back in high school,  the big thing was to find a bug
     in the OS.  But,  once we found it,  instead of using it to  keep
     the system flat on its back,  we documented it and sometimes even
     fixed it.  Doesn't seem like that is the case anymore...

     On this system, some caller breaks in, deletes all the files, and
     then writes a program which keeps the drives selected; this burns
     out the motors on 5.25" drives,  especially  when  they  run  all
     night.  This was done so often, the system was brought down for a
     long time (until a trace could be put on the dial-up).

     I run my own system and publish software that turns a TRS-80 into
     a  mail  and  message  system.  I  have  sat  and watched callers
     SYSTEMATICALLY attack the system.  This takes several forms:

     1) All commands, series of commands, and options are tried.

     2) The system is assaulted with all manners of control sequences,
        trying to get some unexpected result.

     3) I have even seem someone drop and then re-initiate carrier  to
        see if they could get somewhere.

     If  that doesn't work,  they begin to crack passwords.  They know
     what they are doing...  in one case,  I watched as  someone  went
     through   what   looked  like  the  beginning  of  the  Webster's
     Dictionary trying to get superuser status.  Since most people use
     words, not a bad idea, right?  Less intelligent ones start with A
     and just try and try and try.

     Oh,  by the way,  they are definitely using auto-dial modems  and
     software to do this.

     If  all  else fails,  they simply tie up the system.  They choose
     the most obviously disk intensive command,  and execute it  again
     and  again.  Since  many  systems  only timeout after inactivity,
     this could tie up the system for many hours (not to  mention  the
     wear and tear on the equipment).

     These   little   bastards   certainly   aren't   doing   anything
     constructive.

     Seven years ago,  I called up MIT-MC and got  a  tourist  account
     which  I  kept for three years until I got an authorized one.  It
     was a free account on an open system;  the only strings were that
     I  use  it  after  hours  and not tie up too many resources.  But
     things have changed.  You can't have totally open systems anymore
     without many precautions and  almost  constant  supervision.  For
     example,  I have had to add many security features to these small
     systems:

     1) Three  attempts  and  you  lose  the connection.  Nine illegal
        attempts at a user name  without  a  correct  login  causes  a
        suspension.   Anyone  trying  to  login  under  that  name  is
        immediately suspended (with some exceptions).

     2) Connection limited use.

     3) Application process reviewed by sysop before someone  can  use
        all features, or even use the system.

     4) Isolate   the   user  completely  from  all  operating  system
        functions,  even to the point of modifying the DOS to hang  or
        reset when necessary.

     I do have one little "joke" up my sleeve.  There is an account on
     these  systems  called  SYSOP.  Now,  if I was going to break in,
     that is where I would start.  I've put a  little  patch  into  my
     host.  After  39  incorrect tries on that account,  IT ALLOWS THE
     CALLER THROUGH.  He gets a welcome message  and  Sysop  command:.
     He can renumber messages,  change the date and time,  even delete
     from the directory,  change user names and passwords.  He can  do
     all the things that a sysop can do.  Of course, he isn't *really*
     doing  anything  (he he he!) After,  oh say,  10 minutes,  output
     stops. 24 linefeeds are issued and the following appears (slowly,
     as if from a TTY):

         HELLO INTRUDER!  Gee,  I want to thank you for hanging around
         for  the past ten minutes while we had a chance to trace your
         call.  It is  too  bad  that  some  people  just  can't  live
         responsibly.  But,  I  guess  that  is the reason we have the
         police and FBI, right? {disconnect}

     I don't know what the answer is, but I do know that treating this
     type of behavior casually must be stopped.  There will always  be
     people   who  will  try  to  circumvent  all  security  measures,
     sometimes out of curiosity,  but recently  more  often  with  the
     intention of doing something destructive.

     It's  too bad that the days of the unsecured systems is coming to
     a close,  but with hundreds of people scanning the exchanges with
     their auto-dial modems looking for carriers,  armed with 10 pages
     of pirated MCI access codes, we don't have much choice.

     Matt Gertner, 141/320

                            Defending the Amiga


     While the article by Mike Roberts (Fido 120/5) in  FidoNews  #314
     certainly  pointed  out some of the Amiga's weak points,  I don't
     think it did credit to what I am increasingly inclined to believe
     is one hell of a machine.  While it certainly can't compete  with
     the IBM XT in terms of software, or with the Atari ST in terms of
     price,   it   can  compete  with  both  on  an  the  basis  of  a
     price/performance comparison.

     The complaint that the Amiga does not have as  much  software  as
     the XT is,  of course,  legitimate.  However,  it also applies to
     EVERY  other  computer  on  the  market,   bar  none  (even  100%
     compatibles  have some problems).  No computer who doesn't try to
     be compatible with the XT can even come close. However, Commodore
     has done a very good job a) encouraging software developers  with
     some  excellent technical manuals and b) bridging the gap between
     the Amiga and the XT with a very well designed emulator  package.
     I cannot agree that the emulator is overpriced. The lastest quote
     I  have  heard  is  $500 with accelerator hardware and IBM drive.
     Compare this to the over $1500 that is  charged  for  MacCharlie,
     the Mac/IBM link.  Now if someone can show me where to get an IBM
     compatible for that kind of price,  I will happily send the check
     off today!  In fact,  my major complaint with the emulator is its
     late release date.  While I don't think the term  "vaporware"  is
     accurate  in  this  case,  I do think CBM has been a bit sluggish
     with the emulator release. As always, we'll see.

     Whether the Amiga should or should not have  been  aimed  at  the
     market  place  already  occupied  by  the  IBM  is rather a shaky
     question.  The fact is,  no one can expect to beat IBM on its own
     territory.  The Amiga,  however,  does offer some features the XT
     can't hope to match. The graphics are superlative and FAST (three
     dimensional animation so fast you'll think its really happening),
     and the 4-channel stereo sound has to be heard to be believed. As
     far as I can tell,  almost as many Amigas are  being  bought  for
     artistic purposes (by musicians or artists) as for home use.  And
     while I have yet to see some really good  business  software  for
     the  Amiga,  that  does  NOT mean it doesn't exist,  as I haven't
     tried to get my hands on  any.  Some  packages  sound  very  nice
     (notably  VIP  Professional),  and  claim (wheeze) to be shipping
     now.

     As far as the Amiga's price is concerned, I have to admit that it
     was rather overpriced.  However, the monitor is now free with the
     system,  which  the  brings  the 512k system price down to $1495.
     This is compared to $995 for the color  512k  Atari  ST.  But  it
     doesn't  stop  there  - the Amiga also multitasks,  has drives of
     twice the capacity of the Atari and the sound  and  graphics  are
     Fidonews                     Page 5                   19 May 1986


     indisputably better.

     While the Amiga is by no means a sure success,  I don't believe a
     cursory glossing over it (well,  IBM has more software and the ST
     is  cheaper)  does justice to the machine.  My exposure to the ST
     side of things is VERY limited (I have no  idea  what  the  Atari
     software  scene  is like),  but looking through either of the two
     Amiga magazines I have seen (AmigaWorld and Amazing Computing)  I
     feel more and more confident of the Amiga's success. After heated
     debate with a Tecmar employee over the price of their hardware, I
     saw  the  T-Disk  (20  meg  drive)  and  T-Card (1 meg of memory,
     clock/calendar,  serial port) advertised for nearly one  half  of
     list  price.  What  this  means  is that a 1 1/2 meg Amiga is now
     available for a little over $2000.  I have  no  idea  what  Atari
     offers  in  terms  of expandability,  but it's hard to beat that;
     especially when the next step is an $850 20 meg  hard  drive.  As
     with  all new products in the computer arena,  time and software,
     not initial impressions, will be the final test.

     Mike Hamilton, 103/501

                                 Born Again


     Following is a reprint by permission of a  message  left  in  the
     Bible  message/discussion  area  on my board giving some ideas on
     defining Born Again.  I  thought  some  others  might  gain  some
     pleasure from reading it.

     MESSAGE:

     There  are several terms that we hear today which are synonymous.
     Among these are "born again",  "saved",  "trusting in the  Lord",
     "the  new  birth",  etc.  One thing you'll find when you read the
     Bible is that there are only two kinds of people in the word.  It
     is not broken down into the good and bad or the right  and  wrong
     or  me  and  them.  It  is simply broken down between those "born
     again" and those not born again.

     In John 3 the Lord Jesus gave the most concise and simple  answer
     to  your  question.  We  enter into this physical life through an
     experience called 'birth', the act of which we call being "born".
     If we wish to enter into a spiritual relationship with  God  then
     we  have  to experience a "re-birth" or be "born again".  In Acts
     16 someone asks the question:  "What must I do to be saved?"  The
     reply  was  simple:  "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ.  " But it
     goes further than just a mental assent that He  lived  or  was  a
     good guy.

     In  Romans  3  we see our inadequacies from GOD'S STANDPOINT (not
     our dealings  with  our  fellow  man).  It  is  not  so  much  an
     indictment  of  our CHARACTER as it is our CONDITION.  That's why
     we can't just quit doing 'bad' and start doing 'good' to be  O.K.
     We  can  clean  up the outside but we can't touch the inside - it
     virtually takes a 're-birth'.

     If your interested I can go farther into this.  I haven't  talked
     about being redeemed by the "precious blood of Christ";  the gift
     of God; the forgiveness of sin;  our mediator with God - the Lord
     Jesus, etc.

     If you want a little more let me know.


                                         Ron

     The following systems and modems have been found by users to work
     with FIDO.  The author takes no  responsibility  for  support  or
     accuracy.  On a more positive note, please keep the compatibility
     information  coming to Bill Allbritten on 11/301.  I have decided
     to keep this list up to date on a rolling basis; so if you obtain
     new hardware not specifically  discussed  in  the  original  Fido
     documentation  or  in  this listing,  please drop me a message on
     11/301 so I can keep this list going.  I  will  publish  it  from
     time  to  time;  the  two files containing the information are in
     file area 5 of 11/301 as FIDOCOMP.TXT and  FIDOMODM.TXT.  Several
     users  in  England  are  desperate for compatibility information.
     Just use a format  similar  to  the  report  that  follows.  Bill

     Tom Smith, 14/619

                     Happy Birthday to ... Dolores????


     Ever had a birthday that went by without anybody noticing?  Well,
     I have a friend,  a very close friend,  with that problem.  She's
     about to turn 27,  thinks she's getting old,  kinda lonely as all
     her friends keep getting married.  Anyway,  she *claims* that she
     never gets any cards for her birthday,  so she might as well quit
     having them.  I'd like to help her out, and you can help.

     Why not send her a card?  Yes,  you!  I tried a similar thing  on
     another  friend  a  few  years  back  in  college.  Called all my
     friends around the country and enlisted their  aid;  they  called
     their friends etc.  Total turnout:  over 250 birthday cards for a
     young lady who said she never got anything for her birthday.  She
     loved it!  And that was without the power of FIDONET!

     So how 'bout it?  Make her day,  and make  her  believe  all  the
     things  I've  told  her  about  the nice people running around on
     bulletin boards.  Send that card to:

             Dolores
             6097 Westbrook
             Brook Park, OH 44142

     Her birthday is  May  21.  Tell  your  friends,  tell  everybody.
     Let's make this a birthday she'll never forget!

     W.R.Hunter/E.S.Hunter, 109/626

                      On-Line Employment Opportunities

          After joining the FidoNet BBS system in March of this  year,
     we  have been at a loss as to how best serve our user's and other
     Fido Sysop's.  Finally after drifting along rather aimlessly  for
     a few months,  we decided that perhaps the best way was with what
     we do best,  providing  timely,  extensive,  complete  employment
     vacancy information dealing with the Computer Industry.

          Currently we do produce regular employment newsletters which
     are  utilized  by other businesses,  and made available to people
     via libraries and  colleges.  We  thought  perhaps  some  of  the
     people  associated  with  FidoNet  could  make  use  of  the same
     information.   Employment  listings  available  immediately   are
     placed in two files, as follows:

                 EMPLOYJR.??? - Entry/Mid-level positions
                 EMPLOYSR.??? - Senior level positions

          File  extensions  will  be  .TXT  for text files that can be
     viewed while on-line,  or .ARC files that can be  downloaded  and
     reviewed  at  your own convenience (much better for long distance
     calls.) The positions will include vacancies nationwide, although
     admittedly more from the Washington,  D.C.  area (due to the vast
     influx of new businesses in the Metro area),  and will be updated
     on a weekly basis (each Sunday).

          There is no charge associated with this service,  instead it
     is  to  be  run  via the "contribution if-it-works-for-you" idea.
     Should you benefit from any information,  such as finding gainful
     employment,  all  we ask is for a donation of any amount you deem
     appropriate.  The same applies to companies or recruiters, should
     they wish to have any openings included in any issues,  there  is
     no  charge  directly.  Should  any  respondents prove to be "well
     received" and they feel the listing worked well, any contribution
     deemed appropriate will be greatly appreciated.  Please note, 25%
     of all contributions received will be sent to  Tom  Jennings,  in
     thanks  for  the  very  wonderful FidoNet BBS system we all enjoy
     using today.

          If any in the FidoNet would like to have these listing  sent
     to  then  via  FidoNet  Mail,  please  contact  us via netmail to
     NOVA_WEG 109/626 or directly at:

                                WEG Systems

                                Springfield, Va  22150

          If the "requests for listings to-be-sent" is large enough we
     will investigate the best way to set-up and coordinate that  type
     of activity.  This information may prove most valuable (again) to
     colleges  or networking hobbyists where individuals are "looking"
     for that perfect position.  Do let us know your thoughts.

          We do  hope  that  in  providing  this  information  we  can
     contribute in a meaningful way to the "upward pursuits" of all of
     you involved in the Computer field.

     Kurt Vanderwater, 147/5
     Netware_HELP, 1/103

                       Fido & Novell Advanced Netware

     Well,  for any of you out there with these two pieces of software
     I suppose you may have tried to put them together and had  a  bit
     of a problem.  I know I did when I tried.  However,  for me there
     was little choice.  If I wanted to run a Fido, I had to have them
     working together.  You see,  we had just put a second network in-
     house and my AT is the file server.  So...  head scratching time.
     After watching the symptoms for a few minutes the  problem  began
     to  look  kinda  familiar.  Then I remembered seeing somewhere in
     the documentation (don't ask me where) that Fido was linked using
     Plink86 and that overlays were being used.  BINGO.  It is a known
     problem that I have had with some  other  software.  The  fix  is
     quit simple.  Below you will find a generic version of it as I am
     not sure but that the  location  of  the  fix  will  change  from
     version to version.

     This  assumes  some  knowledge of IBM's Debug utility.  If you do
     not  have  any  knowledge  of  it  I  suggest  you  look  in  the
     documentation.

         1).  Locate a four byte Hex sequence as follows:
                  B4 EF CD 21

              For your information this translates to:
                  MOV    AH,EFH
                  INT    21H

         2).  Change these 4 bytes to hex 90.  This replaces  the  two
              instructions above with 4 NOP instructions.

         3).  Save the file

     That's all there is to it.

     Christopher Baker, 135/14

     This is a reprint of an article that appeared in these pages last
     year. I am submitting it again to stimulate more responses.  This
     will be NEW to many new Nodes.

                         ON THE INTERESTS OF FIDO:
                        A COLLECTION PROPOSAL TO ALL


     Kurt Reisler's idea of centralizing the collection of information
     on  where  various  versions  of the Fido system can be found has
     spawned an imitator (the SINCEREST form of flattery, Kurt) with a
     similar plan to collect a different bunch of information.

     When I  show  someone  the  FidoList,  their  first  reaction  is
     amazement.  The  next  question  they  ask  is "What do all those
     people do on all those systems?".  I give them the  general  low-
     down on Fido and how the Net operates, but they want to know what
     each node is into, specifically.

     There is a small amount of information to be gained from perusing
     the  titles  of  the nodes but what would the uninitiated make of
     'YAFIP' (109/610), for example?  For that matter,  what would the
     seasoned Fidoite make of it?

     With  this info as background and for the sake of idle curiosity,
     I propose the following:

     1. Any and all members of the Network send a FidoMail message  to
        me  with  a  capsule summary of the main thrust of their board
        and a list of the types of computers they support  with  files
        and/or message areas.

     2. All  nodes  submitting  this  info  also include any unique or
        specialty areas of interest they support,  i.e.,  Fire/Rescue,
        Amateur   Radio,    Equestrians,    Antique   Autos,    U.F.O.
        Observations, etc.

     In turn,  I will compile all the info that comes in and make  the
     resulting  file  available to FidoNews or other Fidos by FidoMail
     or download.

     So,  send those cards and letters folks and let's find  out  what
     kind  of resources we really have in this Network.  FidoMail your
     responses to:  Metro-Fire Fido, 135/14, (305) 596-8611;  the more
     the merrier.

     Thanks in advance for your assistance.

                                * * * * * *

     This  article  generated  a very small response (thirteen,  to be
     exact) when it was  first  published.  I  have  received  several
     requests  for  the  results in recent days and don't have much to
     send out.  So...I am soliciting responses,  once again,  from any

     and all Nodes everywhere.  If you would like to have other people
     know what your Node offers, send a Net message to: Sysop, 135/14.
     Include a list of message and file areas and a brief statement of
     why your Node exists.  It doesn't matter whether you are a public
     or commercial node, large or small, send in a description and you
     will be included. If you have any special access requirements, be
     sure to include them in the message.  If you are a SEAdog capable
     Node,  include that  info  too.  After  I  receive  at  least  50
     responses,  I will generate a Fido Interest Index and send it out
     to all Region Coordinators and requesting Nodes.

     Don't put it off, this time!

     By the way, YAFIP stands for "Yet Another Fido In Potomac".

                        Electrical Fire Prevention.


     Many fires are caused by loose  electrical  wire  connections  in
     factories, hotels, and homes.  I have made a prototype and tested
     a circuit that will trip a convenience outlet circuit if a  loose
     connection develops.

     The  method  that  I  have  developed  works  fine.  However  the
     installation cost is too high for it to be a marketable  product.
     The  idea  is sound,  and warrants pursuit.  As some may know,  a
     circuit breaker,  that is now used as a circuit  protector,  only
     trips if there is a short across the circuit wiring. If there was
     no  breaker  the wires would over heat from excessive current and
     burn,  causing a fire.  There is no protection for a loose joint,
     that  can  also  cause a fire.  The loose joint arcs like a small
     electrical welder.  If there is a load on the line,  this  arcing
     causes the joint to deteriorate rapidly, and become a hot spot.

     There  is  some  protection  as  the wire should be enclosed in a
     metal box.  However, if the load is not released the heat becomes
     intense enough to cause a fire.  The circuit draws  less  current
     as  the  arc increases,  so the breaker will not trip.  My device
     trips and closes down the circuit.  I am open to suggestions, and
     ideas that I will experiment  with.  If  interests  are  aroused,
     then  contact  me  via Fidonet.  Many lives will be saved if this
     system can become an inexpensive product.

     Anyone with any ideas or suggestions, can contact:

                                        Louis Davidson
                                             Via

                             Utility comparison


     Many good utilities are available on bulletin boards  around  the
     country.  Most of these are useful,  some are indispensable a few
     can cause real harm.

     With several utilities providing the same function  the  question
     is,  which  one  will work best in a given situation?  An example
     are utilities which move files from one sub directory to another.

     In the files section of Fresno Micro  Fone  AT  I  found  4  such
     utilities:

          Cmove - File move utility - rev 1.4 5-15-85
          (C) 1985 Daniel Doman

          REDirect (C) 1985, Dickinson Associates Inc.

          MV - Move or Rename Files/Sub-directories
          Version 2.03 - June 9, 1985
          For PC-DOS Versions 2.0 and Above
          (C) Copyright 1985 Harry G. McGavran, Jr.

          MOVE.COM  -  Allows  you  to  actually  move a file from one
          directory to  another  without  an  intermediate  copy.
          (C) Copyright SoftWorks Development, 1985, 1986

     Included  are  copyright,  version,  date  and author information
     where this was available with the software.

     I would like to know if you use any of these utilities and  which
     one  you  use.  I suspect there may be other similar programs out
     there,  if you use something else I'd like  to  know  about  that
     also.  If you have tried more than one of these,  tell me why you
     chose the one you using.  If any of these have created  problems,
     I would like to know that also.

     I  know  this  survey  will  be  of  interest to those of you who
     respond.  If I receive a good responses,  I will publish these in
     a future issue of Fido News.  If there is enough interest in this
     type  of  information,  I  will conduct similar surveys for other
     types of utilities.

     Let me hear from you.

                Daylight Savings Time and the Mail Schedules


          We have again entered our semiannual Period of Confusion.  I
     had hoped this year would be easier,  since  FidoNet  mail  times
     didn't really change, but, alas.  .  .

          For  the record, if when the country shifts it clocks you do
     nothing, your mail schedules will be right!   If  you  prefer  to
     reset  your  system  clock  to match "wall clock" time, then move
     your mail schedules in the same direction and your still right.

          The following table lists the start time  for  the  national
     mail event for the "contiguous 48." and is correct year 'round:


                      Pacific Standard Time    1:00
                      Pacific Daylight Time    2:00

                      Mountain Standard Time   2:00
                      Mountain Daylight Time   3:00

                      Central Standard Time    3:00
                      Central Daylight Time    4:00

                      Eastern Standard Time    4:00
                      Eastern Daylight Time    5:00

          Just  pick out the time by which you set your clock, and set
     your mail schedules so that the start or your national mail event
     corresponds to the time in the table.
