                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================

     Hi.

     I'm really worn out, guys.

     I've been to COMDEX. I don't really know what to tell you about
     what I saw there. More Taiwanese (and other) crap, lots of 486
     motherboards, damn few 486 systems you can buy because the FCC
     is still frying eggs on the case -- Windows mania, Bob Denver in
     his Gilligan outfit, some poor brave UNIX-loving souls... and
     probably the first show where there was enough OS/2 product to
     make it seem that you could actually use it in your business.

     I think I'm going to wait for some PC rag to tell me What It All
     Meant To The Industry. Because I sure can't figure it out. All it
     means to me is that my feet don't like me one bit (and that I now
     have T-shirts from nearly every modem vendor EXCEPT USR).

     While I was gone, someone in Zone 3 sent an interesting article
     which you'll be reading in a few minutes. In it, he suggests that
     Zone 3 should secede from FidoNet. I have had a similar but
     perhaps more grandiose idea myself.

     What I would like to see is the breakup of FidoNet into separate
     domains, operating independently. The domains should be set up
     more or less the same as the Zones are now arranged (such as
     EUR.FIDONET.ORG replacing Zone 2, and so on). The passage of
     mail from one domain to another would be handled by the ING
     Policy that was published recently. My idea goes on and on, and
     I'll expound upon it more next week. I just thought it would be
     appropriate to put my idea and Garth's on the table at the same
     time, to get your creative juices flowing. Are you are up to it?

     Back to COMDEX. One of the nicer things that happened was the
     get-together on Wednesday night. I met Henry Clark, my most
     regular of irregular columnists. I met Ward Christensen. I met
     the authors of PCBoard and RBBS-PC. I got together again with
     Phil Becker, Scott Hunter, Rick Deming, Chuck Forsberg, Wynn
     Wagner, and many other people whose company I had previously
     enjoyed. As Henry points out in his column this week, there
     were some very DIFFERENT ideas emanating from the dais. I am
     going to attempt to get permission to reprint an article from
     Telecomputing magazine to give you a feeling for it.

     THAT was fascinating. I hope you can read it here soon.

     Garth Kidd
     FidoNet 3:680/828


     Here I sit, having had far too little sleep in the last week and
     a half. Unfortunately, in this tired state I decided that a good
     thing to do whilst waiting for the pizza to arrive was to read a
     few editions of FidoNews.

     Ouch.

     Guys, why are you all being so \serious\ about all this? You'd
     think the fate of the world rested on the editorial policy of
     FidoNews. (I have my own views on this, and I'll mention them
     later).

     For now, however, a wee question:

                           _____________________

                           Should Zone 3 defect?
                           _____________________


     Actually, that should read "Should all zones but Zone 1 defect?",
     but since I'm not a member of the other zones, I won't make
     comments on their behalf. Come to think of it, a lot of people
     are going to be a little irked on my speaking "on behalf" of Zone
     3. Don't worry, guys, it's not like I'm in a position of power or
     anything. Noting wrong with expressing an opinion, unless you're
     in ZONE3_SYSOP. Oops, complete giveaway. :-)

     Back to the subject at hand: Zone 1 seems to be largely
     irrelevant to the rest of FidoNet, except as:

      a) something that acts as a really convenient feed point for
         the rest of the Net;

      b) something that keeps us supplied with this "wonderful"
         FidoNews, which hardly any of us read, and;

      c) something that helps coordinate the nodelist for us

     And, of course, there are all of the wonderful people in Zone 1
     that we talk to every day, swapping choice bits of information
     like baseball cards. There are also the people who ask really
     silly questions without bothering to read the manual first, but
     we can put up with them. Most of the time.

     FidoNews 7-47                Page 3                   19 Nov 1990


     Unfortunately, Zone 1 also acts as something else entirely:

      d) a seemingly endless supply of documents like ECHOPOL and
         POLICY, none of which seem to have been formed with any
         zones apart from Zone 1 in mind.

     Guys, just in case you haven't noticed, Australia isn't the 52nd
     state of America yet. (51st? Whatever). And despite the wonderful
     things happening in Europe, they have some pretty definite ideas
     about being annexed to the USA, and they're not "yes, lets!".

     Here in Zone 3, the POLICY we inhereted from you only seems to
     get dragged out of the closet in a couple of situations:

      a) some stickler for rules and regulations has gone totally
         overboard, and is looking for some kind of fight. Usually
         combined with righteous indignation at people not agreeing
         with him or her, and usually to do with trying to kick
         someone else out of the Net, and;

      b) trying to get rid of the aforementioned stickler. Otherwise
         known as "fighting fire with fire". I personally reckon most
         rulebook-bashers are "annoying", often "excessively" so.

     Ditto for ECHOPOL, which I seem to remember reading once. I
     didn't like it. I'm a moderator of an echo, and I really don't
     like the idea of some book-wielding beuracrat being able to take
     an echo away from me and my users.

     Here in Zone 3, and I guess the situation also holds for zones 2
     and 4..infinity, we tend to try and get along without these
     hugely officious tomes. Unfortunately, we have our fair share of
     rulebook-bashers who just \love\ POLICY, and aren't going to give
     up their slice of power for anything.

     What I reckon should happen is that each of the Zones get treated
     essentially as its own FTN (FidoTechnologyNetwork), and pretty
     much IGNORE anyone from Zone 1 trying to tell them how to run
     their lives. Heck, we're already largely doing that. Why not make
     it official?

     WORLDPOL is a great idea, because it makes each Zone largely
     responsible for its own actions. We can all adapt the rules to
     suit our environment, which is great. It also allows the same
     kind of thing to happen at the regional and network levels. Oh,
     just one thing, folks:

                  NOBODY SHOULD HAVE TO JOIN A PARTICULAR
                       NETWORK IF THEY DON'T WANT TO.

     Gosh, that'd mean removing the requirement that networks be
     formed on solely geographical boundaries, wouldn't it?

     FidoNews 7-47                Page 4                   19 Nov 1990


     Damn right it would.

     This means that if you don't like the rules a particlar network
     is using, you are actually allowed to leave it and look for
     another more to your liking. Without that little statement, all
     the nice "democratic" stuff is pretty useless, because people
     don't have the option of voting with their feet. The statement in
     caps above should be a part of WORLDPOL that simply can't be
     overriden by POLICY at any level.

     Back to WORLDPOL: it needs a little more work, mainly to do with
     correcting some of the more ambiguous wording. Also, section 6 is
     a little strange. What, exactly, are the "western standards" of
     democracy?

     As far as the Council is concerned with voting: their having to
     approve the voting method used to vote for WORLDPOL and the local
     POLICY is fine. Them being able to block a Zone from choosing its
     own extremely strange, "non western" system of deciding things
     from then on is not. Some networks work VERY well with benevolent
     dictators, and if people don't like them, they can always vote
     with their feet. So long as they're allowed to, of course, and
     they should be.

     So, support WORLDPOL and suggest changes to it if you like. I'm
     sure the authors will appreciate it. :-)

                            Back to "defecting":

     If Zone 1 doesn't approve WORLDPOL or a variant thereof, it
     shouldn't be too surprised if the rest of the world sticks a
     symbolic finger in the air and approves it without them.

                                    ===

     On Editorial policy: Cute topic. Very hot. The debate on that
     one's going to last nearly as long as the abortion debate, and it
     too will suffer from people pushing the limits. I just hope
     someone doesn't UUencode bits of the nodelist archive and try to
     submit it as an article.

     Suggested modifications to the editorial policy:

      a) Incitement to violence of any sort should be vigorously
         supressed. Let people discuss (say) how evil and thick they
         think black people are until the cows come home, but as soon
         as they advocate killing them off, put the foot down.

      b) Most places have defamation and libel laws. Remember that.

      c) Where are all the disclaimers? Lots of people are saying
     FidoNews 7-47                Page 5                   19 Nov 1990


         plenty radical things with \no\ disclaimers. The risks you're
         taking, especially in Zone "home of the lawsuit" 1, are
         pretty damn obvious.

      d) Each Zone should have its own FIDONEWS equivalent.

      e) There should be a FIDONEWS equivalent dedicated to \just\ the
         operation of the network itself, discussion of rules, and so
         forth. This'll be less amusing, but more compact.

     Anyway, on with the show for the time being. Have fun, people.

     Comdex '90

     Due to the special weekly electronic nature of Fidonews, you
     are probably reading your first column on Comdex '90.

     It was bad...  not terrible, but really almost boring.

     Sunday : Nice flight into Vegas and then all stop.  It took my
     sister's husband 1.5 hours to get the car so even though they
     were there ahead of me, we waited.  Hurry up an wait.  I'll
     have to find a better time to arrive if I ever go again.

     I love to drive onto the strip and see the lights.  It's always
     amazing.  We got to Bally's hotel and joined the madhouse
     there.  Finally got checked in.  It's such a nervous situation
     with so many people packed around you, waiting in line, with
     only a reservation slip in hand.  Pray they have your room.
     They did, and we all got rooms together, so slick.

     Up in the room, the computer works and the modem works;
     I'm set.

     Monday : register and badgemaking and another long line.  Well
     not as bad as I saw later.  I failed to receive my badge in
     the mail, and rather than fight the Convention Center lines, I
     just had a new one made in Bally's with a spare guest pass.  I
     don't think anyone pays to attend the exhibits.  There were
     guest passes lying on the floor.

     We cruised Bally's two showrooms first.  Most interesting was
     the real-time video in a Window's window, which will be useful
     for our video conferencing product.  New Media Graphics has a
     $800 board and software to put the video signal into a Windows
     window, sizeable and movable.  Other companies had video on the
     PC screen, but they were pure hardware, not real time or cost
     $2000.

     Also checked out the ASP - Association of Shareware
     Professionals and the Mustang Software Wildcat BBS display.
     It's amazing who you find at Comdex. PKWare and Artisoft too.

     Then off to the Sands Convention Center.  The next biggest
     exhibition hall. I looked at 486 boxes, 486 cards ( not
     motherboards, there were a ton of those ), rewritable optical
     disks, and the Dolch 486 lunchbox portable.  The VGA Color
     plasma screen on the Dolch was beautiful and 3800 bucks !  I
     picked up a lot of junk too, which Kevin will like.

     FidoNews 7-47                Page 9                   19 Nov 1990


     Nobody has synchronous multiport cards ( well, I do, but nobody
     else does ).

     Worn out feet and brain.  Hopped a taxi back to the hotel and
     took a nap.  Well, except it lasted 12 hours...

     Tuesday : Rest of Sands was boring.  There's nothing new at
     Comdex.  I've either heard about it before, or it's the same
     old stuff.  I am happy to have seen several 486 on a card
     vendors for our passive backplane computer setup.

     Wednesday : Did the Hilton. Very interesting talk with a
     surface mounting company, who talked about board manufacturers
     and costs, etc.  This is the good stuff.  Saw the Quarterdeck
     X-Windows running, I thought it was ugly.  A real-time video
     product called the Video Toaster looked like the hottest
     display at the show.  Real-time manipulation of video,
     including colorization and lots of effects. Unfortunately, (
     for me ) it ran on an Amiga.

     Next the Convention Center proper.  Big companies, shows and
     lots of interesting convention items, but again, no new PC
     stuff.  I did make a point of picking up the PC-Mag and PC-Week
     benchmark diskettes.

     Stopped in at the Oracle meeting room.  Many VARs showing
     Oracle and DB related tools and apps.  I felt like I could have
     shown an Oracle app or two there.  Spoke at length with the
     people from JAM, which makes a forms tool.  Too bad their demo
     was kind of ugly, I guess they go overboard showing features.
     Also checked in with the Oracle VAR program people, got signed
     up for some info to do that.

     I now have little regard for Comdex '90.  I know this was my
     first trip, and I really am not doing business here, but 95% of
     this stuff represents money better spent on support or new
     products.  I'm convinced that multimedia simply means you have
     more than 12 chairs for your presentation.

     All the PC distributors begin to sound the same.  A 386 box
     here for $695. A big hard drive there for $195.  In quantity of
     course.  I'm just not interested in power supplys and
     motherboards.  Nor is there much point in watching the
     Wordperfect/Word/Wordstart type presentations.  For an
     end-user, a good magazine subscription would be much better.

     Across the street at the Dunes, the Telecomputing party was a
     highlight.  There were keynote speakers and door prizes.  In
     one room in one hour I shook hands with Vince Perriello, Wynn
     Wagner, Chuck Forsberg and Phil Katz.  I guess I won't wash my
     hand for a couple of weeks.  For a BBS Sysop, it was quite an
     experience.  The latest Telecomputing magazine had an article
     which was expounded upon several times by speakers :  democracy
     thru modems.  What a crock. These guys may write the software,
     but they certainly haven't tried to use it. [Editor's note:
     None of the folk Henry just mentioned had anything to say along

     those lines. We were trying very hard to be polite...]

     It was a good experience to end the week on.  Oh, I stayed in
     Vegas for another day, I just didn't fool with the convention.
     Next week, I'll give you the low down on the 'vacation' part of
     my trip.

             =========== >>> PERNnet: Brigadoon Weyr <<< ==========
             *********** >>>    Gift Certificate     <<< **********

     Welcome to the planet PERN where one can play Pernese style of
     life.  With this Certificate you may get ONE link into PERNnet
     regardless of the originating system's origin and network.

     Brigadoon Weyr is devoted to the weirder things in life -- fringe
     groups, nonstandard religions, Elvis searchers, cult movies, bad
     audio and video, and certified maniacs and politicians.  It is
     the goal of The Brigadoon Weyr to allow the weird, the odd, the
     huddled masses yearning to be free an electronic playpen in
     which to espouse their varied belief systems. It is a network
     of losers, winners, dreamers, screamers.

     In time the Pernese conference where one will play out the roll
     of a Pernese name and also be able to have (a) Fire Lazard(s) or
     be a dragon rider to defend the planet Pern againsts the Red
     Planet that visits every 400 years.

     In closing, I point out that we are all of us doing this as a
     hobby, and will tolerate no politics or powerplays. We make no
     distinctions as to age, background, religion, sex, gender, et
     cetera.  We are an Equal Opportunity Network, limited solely by
     the ability to move echomail around in a reasonably good manner.
     Problems with offending nodes will be dealt with via the path
     structure of the network until it reaches The Brigadoon Weyr
     Central (1:325/101@FidoNet) where we will deal with it as need
     be.

     For your free information package you may file requet the magick
     name of BRIGADOON from 1:325/101 @FidoNet, 9:1010/11 @ParaNet,
     69:2700/1 @KinkNet(AdultLinks) and this will get you the file
     BRIGADON.ZIP.  If by chance you can not deal with ZIP type
     ARChives...FREQ the name BRIGADON.ARC.   You may also FREQ
     BRIGADON.ZIP from Carl Finkeldey at 1:363/71 @FidoNet.
