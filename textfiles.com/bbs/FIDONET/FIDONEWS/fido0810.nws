                     Vote: Proposed New FidoNet Policy
                     ---------------------------------

             Matt Whelan, 3:3/1000 (3:712/627)
             International Coordinator

     In accordance with current FidoNet<tm> policy, version 4.07, a
     majority of the RCs have requested a vote on a proposed new
     policy, generally known as WorldPol.

     Please read WorldPol (see below) carefully. Note that the version
     to be voted on is v1H, which has NOT previously been published.

     The vote will be conducted in accordance with Sections 8.1-8.6
     of current policy. I would like to draw everyone's attention to
     section 8.3 in particular:

             8.3  Eligibility to Vote

             Each member of the FidoNet coordinator structure at and
             above Network Coordinator is entitled to one vote. (Hub
             coordinators do not vote.)  In the case of the position
             changing hands during the balloting process, either the
             incumbent or the new coordinator may vote, but not both.
             If a person holds more than one coordinator position,
             they still receive only one vote.

             Network coordinators are expected to assess the opinions
             of the members of their network, and to vote accordingly.
             A formal election is not necessary, but the network
             coordinator must inform the net of the issues and solicit
             input. The network coordinator functions as the
             representative of the rank and file members of FidoNet.

     As this is not a 'personality' vote, I see no need for secret
     balloting. This will, hopefully, encourage all eligible voters
     to present a truly representative view of net-wide opinion.

     The schedule for voting is as follows:

          - March 15 - April 11: discussion period

          - April 12 - April 25: voting period

          - April 26 - April 30: Regional vote totals (*) to be
                                 published in appropriate local/
                                 regional Sysop conferences

     FidoNews 8-10                Page 2                   11 Mar 1991


          - May 1:  deadline for advising RC of local
                    problems/protests, or ZC of RC's failure to
                    publish/include valid votes.

          - May 2:  deadline for Regional totals to be sent to the ZC,
                    zone tabulating (*)

          - May 9:  deadline for Zone totals to be sent to the IC
                    Zone totals to be published in appropriate
                    local/regional/zone sysop conferences.

          - May 15: deadline for advising ZC/IC of problems/protests

          - May 16: deadline for IC to report final results to the ZCs

          - May 20: complete results are published in the Nodediff
                    and FidoNews

     (*) All nets will be shown in the Regional report, and all nets
     and regions will be shown in the Zone report. Any that do not
     vote will be listed as such. The total numbers MUST give the
     total number of regions and nets in each zone. For example:

     Zone 999, Solar System

     ZC              YES

     RC 01           NO
     Net 123         YES
     Net 234         NO
     Net 345         YES
     Net 456         NO
     Net 567         YES
     Net 678         NO

     RC 02           YES
     Net 789         NO
     Net etc.


     No vote cast:

     RC 99
     Net 890
     Net 901
     Net etc.

         FidoNet Worldwide Policy Document         Version 1h
                                                   December 9th, 1990

       This Worldwide Policy document has been released for vote by
     the Coordinator structure and is not yet in force.


     1 FidoNet

       This document installs an international (inter-zonal) policy
     for sysops who are members of the FidoNet organization of
     bulletin board systems worldwide.  FidoNet is defined by a list
     of nodes (NodeList) issued on a weekly basis by each of the Zone
     Coordinators, on behalf of the International Coordinator.

       A node is understood to be a "member system" of FidoNet. The
     collection of nodes is classified into Zones, Regions and
     Networks.

       Each FidoNet Zone is entitled to issue its own policy
     document, according to its own needs and customs.  This
     International Policy, determines general rules which must be
     specified -and may not be contradicted- by the Zone Policies.

       Regions and local Networks may also issue their own policies,
     provided such policies do not contradict this International
     Policy or the respective Zone's policy.


     1.1 Overview

       FidoNet is an amateur electronic mail system.
     As such, all of its participants and operators are unpaid
     volunteers. From its nearly beginning in 1984, as a few friends
     swapping messages back and forth mainly in North America, it
     consists now of an International community of more than seven
     thousand systems all over the world.

       FidoNet is not a common carrier or a value-added service
     network and is a public network only as much as the independent,
     constituent nodes may individually provide public access to the
     network on their system.

       FidoNet exists to provide electronic mail services to its
     member sysops. To efficiently provide such services, various
     structure and control mechanisms are essential. The structure is
     organized into multiple nets, with decentralized administration.

       This document delineates all of the procedures at the
     international level of FidoNet, as well as some general rules for
     the lower levels (intra-zonal), developed to manage the network.
     Authorities in the international level not defined by this
     document, shall be defined by the Zone Coordinators Council and
     the International Coordinator.

     FidoNews 8-10                Page 4                   11 Mar 1991


     2 Language

       Each zone has the right to determine its own official language.

       At the international (inter-zonal) level, for practical
     purposes, FidoNet adopts English as its official language. All
     the FidoNet documents issued at the international level must
     exist in English. Translation into other languages is encouraged.


     3 Access to FidoNet

       FidoNet membership is open to everybody that fulfills the
     technical standards described in paragraph 5.9. Lower-level
     policies may issue additional restrictions only if particularly
     authorized by the Zone Coordinator Council.


     4 Organization

       The organizational structure of FidoNet, has been developed to
     distribute the administration and control of FidoNet, to the
     lowest possible level, while still allowing for coordinated
     action over the entire system.
       Effective administration is made viable by operating in a
     top-down manner.
       This means, that a person at any given level is responsible to
     the level above, and responsible for administrating the level
     below.

       If a person at any level above sysop is unable to properly
     perform their duties, the person at the next level may replace
     them.  For example, if a Region Coordinator fails to perform, the
     Zone Coordinator may cause the Coordinator to be replaced.
     Coordinators may also be removed by a majority vote of the level
     below. For example, if network Coordinators in a region lose
     faith in the ability of a Region Coordinator to effectively
     perform, they may vote to have a new Coordinator elected.


     4.1 International Coordinator

       The International Coordinator (IC) is the Executive Officer of
     FidoNet and coordinates the joint production of the master
     nodelist by the Zone Coordinators. The International Coordinator
     is responsible for creating new zones in FidoNet, but can only do
     so with the approval of the Zone Coordinator Council.

       The International Coordinator is selected by unanimous vote of
     the Zone Coordinators, and removed by a majority vote of the Zone
     Coordinators.

     FidoNews 8-10                Page 5                   11 Mar 1991


     4.2 Zone Coordinator Council

       The Zone Coordinator Council (ZCC) consists of the Zone
     Coordinators -each having a single ballot- and the International
     Coordinator. In the event of a ZCC vote tie, the International
     Coordinator may cast an additional vote to untie the election.

       The Zone Coordinator Council is the legislative body of
     FidoNet, it represents each of the zones in FidoNet. It is the
     highest authority of the network's Top-Down organization.


     4.3 Zones and Zone Coordinators

       A zone is a geographic area containing one or many regions,
     covering one or more countries.

       The Zone Coordinator is the Executive Officer of the Zone, and
     the zone's representative to the other zones.

       The Zone Coordinator compiles the nodelists from all of the
     regions in the zone, creates a master nodelist and a difference
     file, which is then distributed over FidoNet within the zone. A
     Zone Coordinator does not perform message-forwarding services for
     any nodes in the zone, whereas the Zone Coordinator is
     responsible for the formation and/or administration of one or
     more zone-gates to provide interzone mail facilities.

       The method used for selection of Zone coordinators is left to
     the  discretion of the relevant Zone Policy.  In the absence of a
     Zone Policy selection method, Zone Coordinators are elected and
     removed by a majority vote of the Region Coordinators in the
     Zone.


     4.4 Regions and Region Coordinators

       A Region is a well-defined geographic area containing nodes
     which may or may not be combined into networks. A typical Region
     will contain many nodes in networks, and a few independent nodes
     which are not part of the network.

       The Region Coordinator maintains the list of independent nodes
     in the region, and accepts nodelists from the Network
     Coordinators in the Region.
     These are compiled to create a regional nodelist, which is sent
     to the Zone Coordinator. A Region Coordinator is encouraged to
     perform message-forwarding services for nodes within the region,
     but is not forced to, unless the appropriate Zone or Region
     policy imposes such a requirement.

     FidoNews 8-10                Page 6                   11 Mar 1991


       The method used for selection of Regional coordinators is left
     to the discretion of the relevant Zone or Region Policy.  In the
     absence of such a policy selection method, Region Coordinators
     are elected and removed by a majority vote of the NCs in the
     Region.


     4.5 Networks and Network Coordinators

       A network is a group of nodes, normally but not exclusively in
     a local geographic area. Networks coordinate their mail activity
     to decrease cost.

       The Network Coordinator is responsible for maintaining the list
     of nodes for the network, and for forwarding netmail sent to
     members of the network from other FidoNet nodes. The Network
     Coordinator may make arrangements to handle outgoing netmail, but
     is not required to do so, unless the appropriate Zone, Region or
     Net policy imposes such a requirement.

       The method used for selection of Network coordinators is left
     to the discretion of the relevant Zone/Region/Net Policy.  In the
     absence of such a policy selection method, Network Coordinators
     are elected and removed by a majority vote of the Nodes in the
     Network.


     4.5.1  Network Routing Hubs

       Network Routing Hubs exist only in some networks. They may be
     appointed by the Network Coordinator, in order to assist the
     management (especially routing tasks) of the network.


     4.6 Individual systems (Nodes)

       The smallest subdivision of FidoNet is the individual system,
     corresponding to a single entry in the nodelist. The system
     operator (SysOp) formulates a policy for running the board and
     dealing with the users. The sysop must mesh with the rest of the
     FidoNet system to receive and send mail, and the local policy
     must be consistent with other levels of FidoNet.


     4.6.1 Users of an individual system

       The sysop is responsible for the actions of any user when they
     affect the rest of FidoNet (i.e. if the user is annoying, the
     sysop is annoying). The users have no rights under this policy
     document.

     FidoNews 8-10                Page 7                   11 Mar 1991


     4.6.2 Points

       A point is a system that is not in the nodelist, but
     communicates with FidoNet through a node defined to as bossnode.
     A point is generally regarded in the same manner as a user and,
     for example, the bossnode is responsible for mail from the
     point.  Points are addressed using the bossnode's nodelist
     address; for example, a point system with a bossnode of
     1:125/111 might be known as 1:125/111.6. Mail sent to the point
     will be sent to the bossnode, which then routes it to the point.

       Point operators are not FidoNet members, they are only users of
     a FidoNet node, as any other regular user; they have no rights
     under this policy document.


     4.7 The FidoNet Technical Standards Committee

       The FidoNet Technical Standards Committee, abbreviated as the
     FTSC, exists for the purpose of establishing minimum requirements
     in software and hardware to be able to interface with FidoNet.
     These minimum requirements must be obeyed at every level.  Nodes
     not meeting these requirements are ineligible for a node number
     (see section 5.9).  These requirements are subject to change at
     any time by the FTSC.


     5 General Procedures for All Coordinators


     5.1 Making Available Difference Files and Nodelist

       Each Coordinator is responsible for obtaining and making
     available for file request, on a weekly basis, nodelist
     difference files and complete nodelists.


     5.2 Making Available FidoNews Documents

       FidoNews is the Official Newsletter of FidoNet.  Each
     Coordinator is responsible for obtaining and making available
     for file request on a weekly basis, FidoNews Documents.

       This requirement may be waived in the event that a majority of
     the Sysops served by the Coordinator have no desire to read or
     receive FidoNews.  Any Zone Coordinator may also waive this
     requirement under special circumstances.


     5.3 Processing Nodelist Changes and Passing Them Upstream

     FidoNews 8-10                Page 8                   11 Mar 1991


       Each Coordinator is responsible for obtaining nodelist
     information from the level below, processing it, and passing the
     results to the level above.
     The timing of this process is determined by the requirements
     imposed by the level above.


     5.4 Ensure the Latest Policy is Available

       A Coordinator is responsible to make the current version of the
     International Policy available to the level below, and to
     encourage familiarity with it.


     5.5 Minimize the Number of Hats Worn

       Coordinators are encouraged to limit the number of
     FidoNet-related Coordinator functions they perform. A Coordinator
     who holds two different positions, compromises the appeal
     process. For example, is the Network Coordinator is also the
     Region Coordinator, sysops in that network are denied one level
     of appeal.

       Multiple hats are also discouraged due to the difficulty of
     replacing services when a coordinator leaves the net.


     5.6 Be a Member of the Area Administered

       A Coordinator must be a member of the area administered. This
     is, a Network Coordinator must be a member of the network he is
     to coordinate.
     A Region Coordinator must be either a member of a network in the
     region, or an independent in a region.


     5.7 Encourage New Sysops to Enter FidoNet

       A Coordinator is encouraged to operate a public bulletin board
     system which is freely available for the purpose of distributing
     Policy and Nodelists to potential new sysops. Dissemination of
     this information to persons who are potential FidoNet sysops is
     important to the growth of FidoNet, and Coordinators should
     encourage development of new systems.


     5.8 Tradition, Precedent and Technical Management

       A Coordinator is not bound by the practices of predecessor.
     However, it must be clear that Coordinators are bound by all
     requirements of this document, both as FidoNet sysops and as
     Coordinators. The holding of a Coordinator title does not grant
     license to annoy others or to flaunt policy.

     FidoNews 8-10                Page 9                   11 Mar 1991


       The primary responsibility of any Coordinator is technical
     management of network operations. Decisions MUST be made only
     on technical grounds. A Coordinator has the responsibility to act
     as objectively as possible; objectivity must be considered an
     essential factor when making a decision.


     5.9 Exclusivity of Zone Mail Hour

       Zone Mail Hour is the heart of FidoNet, as this is when network
     mail is passed between systems.  Any system which wishes to be a
     part of FidoNet must be able to receive mail during this time
     using the protocol defined in the current FidoNet Technical
     Standards Committee publication (FTS-0001 at this writing).  It
     is permissible to have greater capability (for example, to
     support additional protocols or extended mail hours), but the
     minimum requirement is FTS-0001 capability during this one hour
     of the day.

       This time is exclusively reserved for netmail.  Many phone
     systems charge on a per-call basis, regardless of whether a
     connect, no connect, or busy signal is encountered.  For this
     reason, any activity other than normal network mail processing
     that ties up a system during ZMH is considered annoying behavior.
       User (BBS) access to a system is prohibited during ZMH.

       Zone Mail Hour will be defined by each Zone Policy. In the
     absence of a Zone Policy, it will be defined by the Zone
     Coordinator.


     6 Election and Referendum Procedures

       Any election or referendum at any level of FidoNet, must be
     democratic by western standards.
       Each zone will issue its own election procedures, which must be
     approved by the Zone Coordinator Council before implementation.

       If a worldwide election, with the participation of all zones,
     is to be held, the Zone Coordinator Council will determine the
     election procedures.


     7 Policy Referenda


     7.1 International Policy

       A referendum on International Policy modification is invoked by
     the International Coordinator at the direction of a majority of
     the Zone Coordinators, or a majority of the Region Coordinators
     of all zones, a majority of the Network Coordinators of all
     zones, or by one third of all the sysops in all zones.

     FidoNews 8-10                Page 10                  11 Mar 1991


       All the members of FidoNet are entitled to vote on an
     International Policy referendum, which is to be held according to
     the procedures described by the Zone Coordinator Council before
     the election is called.


     7.2 Zone Policy

       A referendum on Zone Policy modification is invoked by the Zone
     Coordinator, by a majority vote of the Region Coordinators in the
     zone, by a majority vote of the Network Coordinators in the
     zone, or by one third of all the sysops in the zone.

       All the members of the zone are entitled to vote on a Zone
     Policy referendum, which is to be held according to the
     procedures described on the Zone Policy. If such document does
     not exist, the procedures will be determined by the Zone
     Coordinator with the approval of the Zone Coordinator Council.

       The formulation of Region and Network Policy documents is
     encouraged, and must be regulated by the Zone Policy documents in
     each zone.


     7.3 Transition to a 'Worldwide Policy environment'

       After the approval of this Worldwide Policy, the previously
     existing policy will still be in effect for the Zone level until
     the approval of a new Zone policy, according to the methods
     provided in this document.

       All the procedures introduced by this Worldwide Policy document
     adjourn the procedures existing in the previous policy document.


     8 Resolution of Disputes

       The FidoNet judicial philosophy can be summed up in two rules:

            1) Thou shalt not excessively annoy others.

            2) Thou shalt not become excessively annoyed.

       The parties involved in a dispute are encouraged to solve their
     problems directly, without the intervention of a Coordinator.


     8.1 Mediation Requests

       Any of the parties involved may request the intervention of the
     respective Coordinator: Network Coordinator if a dispute between
     members of the same network, Region Coordinator if a dispute
     between members of different networks on the same region; Zone
     Coordinator if a dispute between members of different regions on
     the same zone; International Coordinator if a dispute between
     members of different zones.
     FidoNews 8-10                Page 11                  11 Mar 1991


       The Coordinator requested as "mediator", will ask each party to
     provide all the information before two weeks from the request and
     will make a decision within forty-five days after he received all
     the information from the involved parties.

       A Coordinator, unable to resolve a dispute, may name a third
     party to act as "mediator", provided the parties involved in the
     dispute agree.


     8.2 Appealing to a Mediator's Decision

       A mediator's decision may be appealed to the immediately
     superior level if considered unfair: Region Coordinators handle
     appeals from decisions made by Network Coordinators;  Zone
     Coordinators handle appeals from decision made by Region
     Coordinators; The International Coordinator handles appeals from
     decisions made by the Zone Coordinators; and the Zone Coordinator
     Council will handle appeals from decisions made by the
     International Coordinator,  being the Zone Coordinator Council's
     resolutions, unappealable.

       For appealing to a decision made by a third person named by a
     Coordinator to act as mediator, it will be as if the Coordinator
     made the resolution and the previously enumerated sequence of
     appealing will be appropriate.

       For appealing to a decision made by a mediator, the same terms
     and procedures as for any Mediation Request apply.


     8.3 Statute of Limitations

       A mediation request may not be filed more than 60 days after
     the date of discovery of the source of the infraction, either by
     admission or technical discovery of the source of an infraction,
     either by admission or technical evidence. Mediation requests may
     not be filed more than 120 days after the incident, unless they
     involve suspected unlawful behavior, in which the legal statute
     of limitations of the country involved shall apply.


     8.4 Echomail and File Distribution Networks

       Each FidoNet Zone is encouraged to establish in it's Zone
     Policy, the manner of handling Echomail and File Distribution,
     and the resolution of disputes arising from both distributions.

       No sysop may be required to carry an echomail conference or
     a File Disribution a as a condition of joining or remaining in
     FidoNet.

                 Dennis McClain-Furmanski, APPLE Moderator

     Back in the old days, when Visi-Calc was THE hot software
     package, it seemed that the friendly fruit computers out of
     Cupertino could do everything and then some. Unfortunately,
     Fidonet compatibility was never something that was pulled off.
     Until now.

     Evan Molnar, sysop of Third Stone From The Sun, 1:269/318, has
     completed both mailer and BBS software to hook Woz's Dream
     Machine into our illustrious network.

     The mailer software, called Fruity Dog, is a series of patches
     plus external programs, that will modify the commercial BBS
     package GBBS Pro (L&L Enterprises, Boulder, CO) so that it can
     operate as a fully functional node. As an alternative to GBBS,
     Evan has also written Death Disk BBS, using a compiler similar
     to GBBS's ACOS, and includes the Fruity Dog software with it.

     I realize that the vast majority of Apples still owned by those
     on the net are probably relegated to keeping the kids off the
     'big' machine, or languishing in the attic, under the box of
     polyester pastels from the disco era. But there's still plenty
     of life left in them. Hopefully, moreso now that they can serve
     as a replacement for the machine you're using now, and would
     rather use yourself.

     Also, almost half of the 5.5 million Apple II machines sold
     since 1978 are in schools, most of them still in service. I've
     had a great number of inquiries from educators interested in
     using the network to augment their own work, and the kids'
     education. Now they can.

     For more info, areafix APPLE and pop into the echo, or logon
     269/318  (201) 652-7349, to see DDBBS and leave a note for the
     sysop. Also, you can contact me at 275/42  (804) 424-1075, and
     take a look at the GBBS/Fruity Dog software up and running.

     Michele Hamilton
     1:369/21

                        So, who's it gonna be?

     I'm tired. It's 5 in the morning and I've been working on the
     board all day. Reading mail, answering questions from users,
     trying to find some way to make more room on my hard drive for
     the files I've got, let alone the one's I'll be receiving
     through the SDS and SDN, and it dawned on me that we still don't
     have a ZEC here in Zone 1.

     I decided to write this article in the hopes that maybe we can
     get more than a handful to vote in the upcoming runoff election
     and also, quite frankly, to plug my favorite candidate. Alot of
     you know me. Some of you love me, some of you like me and, I'm
     sure, there are some of you who hate me. I am not usually one who
     speaks out for another, but I just _had_ to... this time.
     (typical woman) <grin>

     I can only speak from experience. I don't know TONY DAVIS but I
     do know AMNON NISSAN, have been in his region for almost 3 years,
     and have found him to be one helluva REC! He CARES!! Amnon has
     helped me through some difficult times... with my machine, with
     my configurations when I was NEC for my net and just about
     anything else I loaded onto him. I have seen this man change...
     from a hated dictator, which he appeared at the time because of
     his ideas and the opposition to the way he was appointed REC, to
     someone who knows how to listen to both sides and will.

     When I first joined Fidonet there were many people in the region
     screaming and yelling at him and his actions were, slightly
     dictatorial. Since then he has grown. He has become someone who
     cares more about the region, and Fidonet in general, than almost
     any other person I know. He freely gives out his phone numbers
     and I'm sure gets calls from all over the place from people with
     questions about the stupidest of things. I've asked a few
     "stupid" questions myself. Yet he has never shown anything but
     patience and helpfulness. His manner has calmed down and his
     approach has improved immensely. This tells me something. That he
     is a person who can learn from his experiences and mistakes.

     We in region 18 have been lucky to have someone like Amnon as our
     REC. He has improved the flow of mail, decreased dupes and made
     it a pleasureable experience for new and old sysops to get their
     mail. Gone are the nightmares of the past. Replaced with reliable
     service and understanding.

     Amnon has been maligned by many but, I believe he is loved by
     more. He can see both sides of the fence. Not that he sits on it.
     But he has the capability and experience to view the whole
     picture which encompasses the echos, including those who move
     'em, those who moderate 'em and those who read 'em. His decisions
     are rarely unjust or wrong but he can admit when he's made a
     mistake and doesn't hesitate to correct it.

     FidoNews 8-10                Page 18                  11 Mar 1991


     These are traits that we need in a Fidonet ZEC. We need someone
     who can address ALL the different sections of echomail, from the
     *EC who spends gobs of money moving the echos around, to the
     moderator who has to handle the sometimes unruly echo participant
     to the sysop who gets frustrated when mail doesn't get through.
     The ability to balance the different aspects of echomail and
     maintain your cool is a rare one. AMNON NISSAN has this ability.

     I know, I know, I know. This sounds like a fan letter. Well,
     maybe it is. I hope you will vote for Amnon in the upcoming
     runoff and believe he's the best choice. But, for whatever it's
     worth, this is more a THANK YOU to him, for the time, effort
     and money he has put into making Region 18 a pleasure to be a
     part of and for his dedication to improving the quality, not just
     the quantity of Fidonet.

     Whatever the outcome, we are sorry to see him go as our REC, but
     we, or least I, am glad he was here. So, who's it gonna be? Well,
     you've got my vote Amnon. :)

     Alejandro Hopkins
     FidoNet 4:900/211.0


                    WORLDPOL, ABOUT TO BECOME POLICY5


     Something great is about to happen. A new, truly democratic
     Policy document will be voted, and will most probably become
     Policy5. If you have been reading FidoNews lately, you must
     already know about Worldpol, the Policy5 proposal that was
     written by sysops all over the world. I have been in the
     project since its very beginning, right after Policy 4 was
     voted. Most sysops didn't like Policy4, and something had to be
     done about it. So we started the Policy5_Project, and since
     then, anybody who was interested in changing the current policy
     document has been able to participate in the making of
     Worldpol. Now the final version (1H) is ready for vote, and the
     IC has called a referendum on it.

     Unfortunately, the voting has to be done according to the
     current policy, so grunt sysops won't have a vote on it, only
     the coordinator structure will. But that, among lots of other
     things, is taken care of in Worldpol. I'll name just a few of
     the improvements of Worldpol over Policy4, although you must
     already know about them:

       - Nodes are not forced to be located in the geographic
         area of the network they choose to belong to. So if
         some crazy dude wants to call the other end of the
         country to pick up his mail, he is free to do so.

       - Coordinators are elected in a bottom-top manner. That
         means that a NC is chosen by the mejority of the sysops
         in the network, a RC is elected by the majority of the
         NC's in the region, and so on. So if most sysops want
         their NC replaced, they just choose another one,
         doesen't matter if that NC is a good friend of the RC
         or not.

       - A referendum on International Policy modification is
         invoked by the International Coordinator at the
         direction of a majority of the Zone Coordinators, or a
         majority of the Region Coordinators of all zones, a
         majority of the Network Coordinators of all zones, or
         by one third of all the sysops in all zones.
         And all the members of FidoNet are entitled to vote on
         it.

       - Zone independency is considered all throughout the
         the document, and the administration of the network
     FidoNews 8-10                Page 20                  11 Mar 1991


         is much more decentralized.

     So this is the oportunity to have the democratic policy
     document we deserve. If you are a *C, vote for Worldpol.  And
     if you are a grunt sysop (just like me), let your NC know what
     you think should be done, and ask him to represent you in his
     vote.

            YAPPPIV (Yet another packet proposal - part 4)

     Over the last two weeks the message/packet status flags have
     been presented, and the overall packet structure as a CASE
     of packet-type.   Now some explanation based on the illustra-
     tions presented in those issues of FidoNews.

     First, why TWO?  The needs of packetted NetMail, and other
     traffic with a single intended recipient differ somewhat from
     the needs of group or conference mail.   Ultimately, the `TO'
     address of Echomail is meaningless, but how it got there and
     who already has it becomes quite important.

     To an actual mailer, however, where it is to send it IS quite
     important in either case, thus the Interim address scheme, the
     identical use in message or packet format, and the elimination
     of the actual addresser and addressee and subject from the
     header.

     The reason for an "Interim Address" is simple.  It is a handy
     place to keep available WHERE the message will be sent by the
     current system.  Any message which does not HAVE an export
     should always have a zero zone in the interim address.  The
     balance of the field is reusable for local message handling.
     The interim address may be changed at each node which processes
     a message or packet, and this is the norm.

     Type-5 packets are ONLY created from messages with identical
     path and seen-by information.  When these are created the length
     fields for the seen-by, path, and area name for all enclosed
     messages are zeroed, and a single copy is maintained at the
     packet level.  In every case, the fields are null terminated or
     omitted, and preceed the message or packet content, in the same
     order as given in the header by their length fields.  Lengths
     INCLUDE any terminating null, thus a length of one may be taken
     as an error or flag value.

     Mail bundles, however, may consist of multiple packets in the
     same "FILE".  Each packet has a distinct header and all mail
     which is destined to any given node is expected to be placed in a
     single file.  Any mix of type-4 and type-5 headers may be mixed
     in a mail bundle, and each of those headers may service
     compressed packeted mail, files, or individual messages.  The
     only bundling requirement is that the interim address be the
     same for every packet or stand-alone message in the bundle.

     BUT WHAT ABOUT THE ADDRESSEE?   At long last, we come to the
     addressee.   There are CCITT standards (in the X.4xx X.5xx
     range) for top-of-text identification of the sender and the
     addressee.  I strongly recommend that these be adopted and
     specified for type-4 and type-5 packets.  This should allow
     for easier inter-networking, as well as the processing by BBSs
     and other mail end use utilities.  I would say that for FidoNet
     usage, the CCITT Private and Public network identifier lines may
     not be necessary while flow is uniquely through FidoNet, UNLESS
     inter-network connection is specified at the origin.  Software
     should be able to generate these lines easily for inter-network
     sharing of group/conference/echo mail.

     Subject "linking", is only partially successful.  The only known
     relationship is when a message is actually replied to, and there
     are many cases when people merely reply to a message to avoid
     typing the addressee's name.  The only linking pre-specified for
     type-4 and type-5 messages is that of related, non-homogenous
     `messages', where the first may contain a pure graphics letter-
     head, the second, the actual plain text, a third, a digitized
     signature, and the fourth perhaps an attached voice message,
     graphics illustrations, or the like.

     This column has been a preliminary presentation of a proposal
     for TWO message header formats which address the growth of the
     FidoNet network, keeping apace with technology, while doing the
     utmost to not leave anyone in the dust.  If anything beyond the
     FTS-0001 type-2 standards are implemented, NodeList flagging
     will be required.

     The TYPE of compression used in logical successors to ARCmail
     has not been addressed, but its presence allowed for.  4-d
     addressing is mandated, though interfacing with 2-d only
     software COULD default MyZone and Point zero, so long as
     this is not a REPLY.  Internally to mail-user interfacing,
     related packers and tossers, and any packet converters,
     the current ^a Kludge lines must be extracted.  The tear
     line with or without its software advertisement, and the
     Origin line BBS advertisements may remain, but are NOT parsed
     from messages bearing type-4 and type-5 headers.  Rather, the
     Origination address IS the point of origin within FidoNet.

     CompressedContent "Messages" and "Packets" must be identified
     within the first 16 bytes of the "text", as to what decompres-
     sion utility is required for extraction.  Unfortunately, at
     least one current standard library & compression utility may
     be excluded by this restriction, but leading ID's have become
     a de-facto standard.   This may merely be an indication that
     the "text" is a stand-alone self-extractor, though this is NOT
     recommended.  Many nodes will merely purge any such self-
     extracting "mail", as a matter of local policy.

     Allowing more freedom with compressed mail shifts the burden to
     the logistics side.  Nodes merely passing-through mail which
     which they are unable to process, MAY be passing the problem
     along.  This header proposal, however, does allow such passing
     as well as the passing of encrypted or otherwise encoded mail.
     Since there are international trade restrictions on some such
     en/decrypt software, using these methods are not recommended,
     but they ARE provided for.

     It is quite concievable that the same mail `bundle' could at
     the same time include:

           1> Machine specific executable code, contained
                 within a libraried and compressed "Archive".
           2> Voice mail.
           3> A PostScript document, similarly compressed.
           4> FTS-0001 compatible text mail, uncompressed.
           5> FTS-0001 compatible text mail, compressed.
           6> A digital ocilloscope recording.
           7> NetMail which is following routing.
           8> EchoMail which is passing along its normal
                distribution route.
           9> NetMail which is from the current to the target
                system, with NO routing.
          10> A set of spreadsheet (or similar) data.
          11> One or more return receipts.
          12> One or more return receipt requests.
          13> An old EBCDIC MainFrame JCL script.
           etc.

     The only logical differentiation between a message and packet
     using the type-4 and type-5 headers is the handling and the
     content.  A message may contain compressed data.  A packet may
     consist of a single message.

     Comments and questions are welcome.

     Software John  1:143/8

     In late June I will be boarding a plane bound for England.
     Once in England, I will retrieve my motorcycle from Customs
     (shipped over seperately) and proceed across the channel to
     France, and up to Assen, Holland to attend the Holland GP
     motorcycle race.

     After the race, I have a bit over two weeks of holiday, and
     plan to ride through parts of France, Switzerland, Austria,
     and wherever else the urge takes me.

     I would consider it a great pleasure to have the opportunity
     to meet fellow SysOps during my holiday travels. If any of you
     in Europe reading this would like a visit from a California
     Yankee, please let me know. I am going to try to brush up my
     French during the next three months, but don't expect fluency!
     <grin>

     Thanks!
