     Everyone must be licking their cyberwounds this week since there are
     no .ARTs or .LETs or .COLs this week. That leaves so much space for
     clearing out these FSC docs. [grin]

     Either that or everyone is perfectly happy in FidoNet. It's a FIRST!

     Enjoy it while it lasts.

     But what's happening in the International Coordinator election?

                    Conference Managers - Specifications for Requests

         Status of this document:

         This FSC suggests a proposed protocol for the FidoNet(r)
         community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
         improvements. Revision 3 presents several additions and
         enhancements over the previous revision.

         Distribution of this document is unlimited.

         Software.

         1  Purpose

            This document will explore the methods implemented by various
            conference managers which process requests (in net mail form)
            for changes to the conference mail links on the system on which
            they are in use.

            Until now, it would appear that no real standard exists, so
            most software authors have either tried to emulate another
            program, or to create a new method of their own, or both.

            Here, an attempt will be made to define a standard, one which
            tries to maintain compatibility with methods already in use,
            while also extending them to provide new functions.

         2  Conventions

            The names of the commands described in the following paragraphs
            are given in upper case, for legibility. However, a conference
            manager should be able to interpret them even if they are given
            in lower or mixed case.

     FIDONEWS 14-15               Page 3                   14 Apr 1997


            Similarly, conference names, or tags, are given in upper case,
            but the conference manager should be able to handle them even
            if typed in lower or mixed case.

            Optional information is enclosed with square brackets, while
            variable information is enclosed with angle brackets. For
            example:

               +CONF [,R=<n>]

            indicates that the section within square brackets is optional,
            and if supplied, requires a parameter after the equals sign.

            Some conference managers may allow commands to be abbreviated
            to the shortest non-ambiguous string. For example, %LIST might
            be reduced to %L.

         3  Format of the request

            A request to a conference manager is generally made in a net
            mail message containing specific information in some of the
            fields. In particular, the addressee is the name of the
            conference manager itself, and the subject of the message is a
            password assigned by the sysop of the system running the
            program.

            For example:

               From:     John Doe, on 2:123/56
               To:       Program,  on 2:234/0
               Subject:  password

            Here the first problem is encountered. Each of the existing
            programs recognizes a different addressee. For this reason it
            is proposed that all such programs recognize requests made to a
            single, "standard" addressee, besides any other they may wish
            to implement.  The term "ConfMgr" has been arbitrarily chosen,
            and should be used by those programs which adhere fully to all
            the standards proposed in this document.

            The text of the message itself contains the request proper, and
            is the subject of the following paragraphs.

         4  Linking and Unlinking of conferences.

            The current methods for requesting that a conference be linked
            are basically two:

               +CONFNAME
               CONFNAME

            For reasons of uniformity, it is proposed that all conference
            manager programs recognize the first method.

            Requests that a conference be unlinked are given by:

     FIDONEWS 14-15               Page 4                   14 Apr 1997


               -CONFNAME

            It might be interesting to implement some form of pattern
            matching, similar to the unix shell. The following basic
            wildcards should be considered:

               *        matches zero or more characters
               ?        matches any one (not zero) character

            Since the requests are processed top-down, a request of the
            form

               +CONFNAME
               -*

            would be redundant, since the ConfMgr would link CONFNAME from
            the first line, and then immediately unlink it again because of
            the second line, which requests that all linked conferenecs be
            unlinked.

            It should also be possible to specify more than one conference
            tag on the same line. For example:

               +CONF1 CONF2 CONF3

            would link the three conferences CONF1, CONF2 and CONF3.

         5  Rescanning Conference Mail

            Many conference managers currently allow a system to request
            that an area be "rescanned". In other words, the system
            receiving the request will export all mail in one or more areas
            to the requesting system.

            This may be accomplished by specifying the %RESCAN command in
            the body of the request. This will force the ConfMgr to
            generate a scan request for those areas which the remote system
            requested with the message containing the %RESCAN command.

            Rescans of a single area, newly linked, could be requested as
            follows:

               +CONFNAME, R[=<n>]

            where 'n' is the number of messages in that area to be
            rescanned.  (The space following the comma is optional, but
            allowed.)

            Rescanning has one serious drawback: dupes! It is very possible
            for the requesting system to have already set up the area with
            several downlinks. Thus, when the rescanned mail is received,
            it could be exported to other systems. In a tree-based
            topology, this is harmless, but in circular topologies this
            would create dupes.

            Thus, it is proposed that system receiving the rescan request
     FIDONEWS 14-15               Page 5                   14 Apr 1997


            add a kludge to the messages, so that they can be recognized by
            the requesting system and not re-exported.

            The proposed kludge is:

               ^ARESCANNED <addr>

            where <addr> is the network address, including domain, of the
            system from which the mail was rescanned.

            In alternative to a rescan, a sysop might request a "sample",
            consisting of a series of messages contained in a text file.
            The ConfMgr would export some or all messages from an area to a
            plain ASCII text file, and send it along with the reply, to the
            requesting system. A "sample" request would be made as follows:

               +CONFNAME, S[=<n>]

            where 'n' indicates how many messages should be sampled.

            a) Updating Conferences

               Update requests allow a sysop to rescan or "sample" an area
               without having to first unlink from it, and then relink with
               the rescan or "sample" parameter.

               The format of this command is:

                  =CONFNAME, <param>[=<n>]

               Thus a rescan request for the most recent 50 messages would
               be specified as:

                  =CONFNAME, R=50

         6  Information Requests

            Requests for information have until now taken two forms. In one
            case, they are given as switches after the password on the
            subject line, while in the second they are given as "commands"
            within the body of the message text. It is proposed that the
            second method be chosen as standard, since it is considerably
            more flexible.

            Below are listed the proposed commands:

              %HELP                    Sends a (pre-defined) help text to
                                       the requesting system, explaining
                                       how the ConfMgr is to be used.

              %LIST[,B]                Lists the conferences currently
                                       available to the requesting system,
                                       on the basis of a method internal to
                                       the conference manager itself. This
                                       list would flag the areas which are
                                       already linked. The 'B' modifier
     FIDONEWS 14-15               Page 6                   14 Apr 1997


                                       would generate the list in
                                       binary format (see section 8e).

              %BLIST                   Equivalent to %LIST,B above.

              %QUERY                   Lists the conferences currently
                                       linked to the requesting system.

              %UNLINKED                Lists the conferences which are
                                       available to the requesting system,
                                       but not currently linked. This is
                                       the logical difference between a
                                       %LIST and a %QUERY.

         7  Remote Maintenance

            Besides these simple functions, it is becoming more and more
            interesting to make handling of the conference mail flow even
            more automatic. For this reason, for example, it might be
            useful to allow another sysop control over your own system,
            adding and removing conferences as need requires. Thus a hub or
            coordinator could automatically have a new area added to their
            conference lists, or discontinued ones removed.

            Naturally, the ConfMgr must be able to distinguish which system
            has the ability to make such changes, but that is beyond the
            scope of this document.

            It is proposed that a conference manager be able to
            automatically add a new conference to the system's list if/when
            it is detected.  Thus no special commands would be required.
            The manager should be able to determine a default list of down-
            links for the new area, and also the "group" of systems which
            could then request it.

            However, should it be desired to explicitly create a new
            conference via remote, this could be done by including a line
            such as the following in the message text:

               &CONFNAME

            In order to remote delete an area, the requesting sysop should
            include a line like this in the body of the message text:

               ~CONFNAME

            Thus, if the system has remote privileges, the conference would
            be deleted (and optionally, all systems linked to the
            conference could be informed of this fact).

            Similarly, it would also be possible to allow a system to
            change the tag of a conference. This would be accomplished by a
            line such as:

               # OLD_NAME  NEW_NAME

     FIDONEWS 14-15               Page 7                   14 Apr 1997


            The ConfMgr should inform all downlinks of the change by
            sending a net mail message.

            It might also be desirable to allow a sysop to make changes on
            behalf of another system. This could be done by inserting a
            special command at the beginning of the request itself. For
            example:

               From:     John Doe, on 2:123/1
               To:       Program,  on 2:987/65
               Subject:  password
               Text:
               %FROM: 2:234/56
               +CONFNAME

            The %FROM command would make the ConfMgr carry out the changes
            as if the system 2:234/56 had requested them. The password
            should nonetheless be the one assigned to 2:123/1.

         8  Further Automation

            In order to make the system more powerful, and to reduce the
            necessity for human intervention, several extensions are
            feasible.

            a) ARCmail Compression Method

               One interesting application is the possibility of allowing a
               remote system to change the compression program used to
               "pack" mail bound for his system. This could be done with
               the following command in the message to a ConfMgr:

                  %COMPRESS <method>

               where <method> is one of the compression programs supported
               by the system. Of course, the remote system should also be
               able to determine which compression methods are available;
               this could be done with

                  %COMPRESS ?

               Requests for an unsupported compression method should also
               be responded to with a list of those available.

               From the practical point of view, only systems which pick up
               their mail (as opposed to those to whom mail is sent) should
               be allowed to change the compression method used. How this
               distinction is achieved is beyond the scope of this
               document.

            b) Passwords

               A sysop should be able to change the password used to make
               requests to a ConfMgr without requiring the intervention of
               the other system's sysop. This could easily be done if the
               conference manager implemented the following command:
     FIDONEWS 14-15               Page 8                   14 Apr 1997


                  %PWD <new_password>

               The new password (case insensitive) would replace the
               current one as of the next request.

            c) Temporary Unlink

               Should a system's sysop be absent for a prolonged period of
               time, he might want to temporarily cut all conferences from
               his uplink.  This could be accomplished with the

                  %PAUSE

               command. This would tell the ConfMgr to temporarily stop
               sending conferences to that system.  On his return, the
               sysop could reactivate them all with the

                  %RESUME

               command.

            d) Forwarding Remote Requests

               If a conference manager receives a remote request to delete
               an area, it could very easily "forward" that request to all
               its downlinks by producing a similar request.  In that way,
               a single request originating from, for example, a Region
               Coordinator, would result in the conference being deleted
               from all systems "below" him.

               Similarly, remote requests for conference name changes could
               also be passed on to downlinks.

            e) Automatic Requests for Conferences

               A conference manager should also be able to automatically
               request an area from an uplink. This would become necessary
               if, for example, it processed a request for an area not
               currently available on the system. In this case, it would
               scan a series of conference lists for the requested area,
               and if found, would send a request for that area.

               In order to be able to do this, the ConfMgr would need to
               have one or more lists of conferences from the uplinks.
               These lists could be produced on request by the ConfMgr
               itself. In order to simplify matters, a binary format is
               proposed.  (Note that these are C-style structures, with
               everything which that implies.) This binary file is called a
               Binary Conference List (BCL).

               The file starts with a header, containing some basic system
               information:

                  struct bcl_header {
                    char    FingerPrint[4];     /* BCL<NUL> */
                    char    ConfMgrName[31];    /* Name of "ConfMgr" */
     FIDONEWS 14-15               Page 9                   14 Apr 1997


                    char    Origin[51];         /* Originating network addr
                    */
                    long    CreationTime;       /* UNIX-timestamp when
                    created */
                    long    flags;              /* Options, see below */
                    char    Reserved[256];      /* Reserved data */
                  }

               The currently defined flags for the header are:

                 BCLH_ISLIST     0x00000001L
                   File is complete list

                 BCLH_ISUPDATE   0x00000002L
                   File contains update/diff information

               The BCL would then contain a series of entries having the
               following format:

                  struct bcl {
                    int     EntryLength;      /* Length of entry data */
                    long    flags1, flags2;   /* Conference flags */
                    char    *AreaTag;         /* Area tag [51] */
                    char    *Description;     /* Description [51] */
                    char    *Administrator;   /* Administrator or contact
                  [51] */ }

               The flags currently defined are:

                  FLG1_READONLY   0x00000001L
                     Read only, software must not allow users to enter
                     mail.

                  FLG1_PRIVATE    0x00000002L
                     Private attribute of messages is honored.

                  FLG1_FILECONF   0x00000004L
                     File conference.

                  FLG1_MAILCONF   0x00000008L
                     Mail conference.

                  FLG1_REMOVE     0x00000010L
                     Remove specified conference from list (otherwise
                     add/upd).

               Thus, instead of scanning an AREAS.BBS style list, the
               ConfMgr would parse and use lists in the above format.
               Naturally, each list would be in some way "attached" to a
               node number, and a corresponding ConfMgr password.

               Each system may only have one master file, called anything
               they want. But when transmitted to other systems, this file
               must always be named ????????.BCL.

               The list would be generated in response to a
     FIDONEWS 14-15               Page 10                  14 Apr 1997


                 %LIST, B

               command in the message text.

            f) Receipts

               It might be useful to have the ConfMgr generate a receipt to
               be sent to another system, perhaps a co-sysop or a sysop
               point node. This could be done with the command:

                 %RECEIPT <name>,<address>

              embedded in the request message. For example:

                 %RECEIPT JoHo,2:270/17

         9  Comments in the request

            It should be possible for a sysop to insert a comment in the
            request made to a conference manager. These comments,
            naturally, would be destined to the sysop of the system, and
            not to the conference manager itself. Such comments should be
            placed at the end of the message, following a %NOTE command.

            In all cases except the above, the request can be deleted by
            the ConfMgr once processed, but messages containing comments
            should be retained.

            Note: the current method used is to supply comments after a
            tear-line. This practice is somewhat "messy", but it might be
            wise to support it until such time as all conference managers
            have implemented the %NOTE command.

                        A New Way Of Addressing In FidoNet(r)

                            Wim Van Sebroeck & Jan Spooren
                                  November 1st, 1992

                 This document replaces the now obsolete version 001

         Status of this document:

          This FSC suggests a proposed protocol for the FidoNet(r)
          community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
          improvements.  Distribution of this document is unlimited.

     A. Why a new Proposal :
     ------------------------
     FidoNet has grown from a few single BBSs to a worldwide network of
     nodes.  Because of that enormous growth, we have several kludge-lines
     just to write to someone else. And for every extra dimension a new
     kludge is necessary.  (3D: ^AINTL ; 4D: ^AFMPT, ^ATOPT ; 5D:
     ^ADOMAIN). Every time a new dimension or addressing-system is
     invented, not only the packer/router software needs to be adjusted,
     but also the message editor and a whole series of other utilities,
     being virtually the whole FidoNet software.

     This is why we made this proposal:
     1) to make life easier for programmers and developers.
     2) to have a system that will have no problems with further backward-
        compatibility. (from this system on)
     3) to have a system that is simple (in usage).
     4) and to have a system that accepts every possible address.

     B. Proposal :
     --------------
     To send a message one needs two things: the origin address and the
     destination address. (And for routing inter-domain messages you also
     need the address of the gateway). Until now, we needed four different
     kludge-lines when we wanted to send a message to another domain
     (^ADOMAIN, ^AINTL, ^AFMPT, ^ATOPT). To minimize these kludges we
     suggest the following:

             ^ADEST <dest_address>
             ^AORIG <orig_address>
             ^AROUTE <route_via_address>

     These kludges are *not* followed by a colon (':').

     1) The ^ADEST kludge: this kludge contains the address where the
        message has to be sent to. In other words: it contains the
        destination address.  <dest_address> is an ASCII string that may
        contain any readable character, (above and including 32 (space) and
        below ASCII 128), and is only terminated by the end-CR of the
        kludge-line. It is up to the mailprocessors of every domain
        (FidoNet compatible or not) if they regard the address as case-
        sensitive or not.

        The FORMAT of <dest_address> is :

        <Address>[@<Domain>]

        Where <Address> is the valid username/address in the network
        <Domain>, and <Domain> cannot have any '@' of '/'-characters in it,
        while <Address> can. The reason why '/' characters are not allowed
        in the <Domain>-field, is because they are necessary to recognize a
        FidoNet-style address, since <Domain> is optional for messages that
        won't be crossing domain- borders. (*)

        In other words:  The domain is always the string behind the last @
        sign in the <dest_address> field, except when domain would contain
        a '/'-character. In that case, <Domain> is the default domain, and
        <Address> is the complete string behind the DEST-kludge.

        Concerning FidoNet-compatible addresses, there are some extra
        rules, since FidoNet is one of these rare networks that haven't got
        the username in the address.

        A valid FidoNet <Address> is made up like this:

        <Username>@<Fido_Address>

        Where <Username>@ is mandatory and <Fido_Address> is a valid
        fidonet address. The FidoNet-address must contain at least the
        zone:net/node number. Point number is optional.

        Eg.: ^ADEST Wim Van Sebroeck@2:292/862.0@FidoNet.Org

        will generate an outbound message for user 'Wim Van Sebroeck' at
        Fido-node 2:292/862.0 within FidoNet. The domain name for FidoNet
     FIDONEWS 14-15               Page 13                  14 Apr 1997


        is 'FidoNet.Org', and *not* just Fido, or FidoNet or whatever. This
        is not a waste of space, since the domain name can be omitted when
        the message remains in the default network. Only for messages
        crossing domain borders, the domain name is necessary. We opted for
        the '.org' and '.ftn' suffixes, in order to make interfacing to
        InterNet easier.

        Some more addressing-examples:

              ^ADEST Jan Spooren@2:292/852.0@Fidonet.Org
              ^ADEST 292/862-cosysops@2:292/850
              ^ADEST TE880714%BANUFS11@BITNET
              ^ADEST Jack@OS/2.dev.itnet@itnet
              ^ADEST m2xenix!uunet!BANUFS11.BITNET!TE880714@uucp

        The first example should be clear, since it will be the most
        frequently used addressing-style.  The 4th example shows the kludge
        for a message to the address 'Jack@OS/2.dev.itnet', within domain
        'itnet'. There is no problem whatsoever with the '/' character,
        because it is part of the <Address>, and not of the <Domain>.
        In the last example, the message has to be sent to the uucp-
        gateway, wich will send it on within the internet-network, with the
        destination-address: 'm2xenix!uunet!BANUFS.11BITNET!TE880714'

        Also this is a valid address:

        ^ADEST Wim Van Sebroeck@2:292/862.0@FidoNet.Org@SIGnet.ftn

        The message will be sent to 2:292/862.0@FidoNet.Org, within
        SIGnet.ftn.  SIGnet will then send the message back to 2:292/862.0
        in FidoNet.  The message will cross the domain-borders twice. Apart
        from the fact that it may seem an annoying practice, technically
        the address is 100% OK.

        Information in the DEST-kludge will always override information in
        the FTS-0001 message header.

        FOOTNOTE:

        (*)

        For a proper understanding of this '/'-restriction, let's
        illustrate this by means of an example. If we send a message with a
        kludge like this:

        ^ADEST Wim Van Sebroeck@2:292/862

        Then the mailprocessor could wrongly interpret the <dest_address>:
        It could decide the <address> to be 'Wim Van Sebroeck' in <domain>
        '2:292/862'. But with the '/'-restriction it is now clear that the
        address is 'Wim Van Sebroeck@2:292/862' in the default domain.

     2) The ^AORIG kludge: this kludge contains the origin address.
        <orig_address> has the same restrictions as the <dest_address>.

        For example: ^AORIG Wim Van Sebroeck@2:292/862.0@Fidonet.Org
     FIDONEWS 14-15               Page 14                  14 Apr 1997


                 or: ^AORIG Infomag.Dev@ITNet


     3) The ^AROUTE kludge: this is needed to point to the gateway address,
        when sending a message to another domain. Since not all gateways
        are listed in the nodelist and because possibly not all
        intermediate systems are aware of a particular domain-name, it is
        necessary to add the address of the gateway.  The gateway is a
        system within the default domain, that can send the message to the
        desired domain. The kludge can also be used, however, to point to a
        zonegate between different zones in one domain. In any case, for
        every domain-border that will be crossed, there needs to be one
        ROUTE-kludge to indicate the gateway. It should be obvious, that a
        FidoNet-address in a ROUTE-kludge never carries a username.

        The ROUTE-kludge always overrides the DEST-kludge. A system
        receiving a message should ALWAYS send the message to the address
        specified by the ROUTE-kludge, and NOT to the destination address.
        In other words, the ROUTE-kludge is not to be interpreted as a hint
        to a possible gateway, but must be regarded as a new destination
        address, and the message will always have to reach the gateway. The
        gateway will then change the ^AROUTE to a ^AROUTD kludge, in order
        to indicate that the gateway received the message, and to see to it
        that the message won't travel back to the gateway. This absolute
        priority of the ROUTE-kludge above the DEST-kludge is necessary,
        since otherwise messages could be bouncing between two nodes that
        both prefer different gateways to send the message to.  The ROUTE-
        kludge also has nothing to do with the actual routing itself.  The
        ROUTE-kludge only defines an intermediate address that has to be
        reached before the message reaches its final destination. How the
        message gets to this intermediate address doesn't matter: it may be
        direct or it may be routed through other systems. Remember that
        FidoNet is an amateur network, with each system paying its own
        phone bills!

     C. Advantages and Disadvantages :
     ---------------------------------
     a) Advantages:
          - The main advantage is that one only needs two kludges to
            specify the origin and the destination address. (And that these
            kludges are always in a message).
          - The system is also very flexible because any address is
            possible.
          - Utilities must not be updated when a new address-dimension is
            created.  - Inter-domain and inter-network messages are finally
            possible.
          - No limits are placed on both username and address-field length.
          - Perfect compatibility is ensured with future message and packet
            formats that will override FTS-0001.

     b) Disadvantages:
          - Please be so kind to write them to us. We can't figure what

     E. Discussion of the Implementation Notes.
     ------------------------------------------

     * O5, "DsblROUT" :

       It is clear that when a message travels through an intermediate
       system which is mentioned in a ROUTE-kludge, this ROUTE-kludge will
       have to be removed, because the message did arrive at this system.
       Instead of just deleting the whole kludge-line, the kludge will be
       changed in ROUTD.  This is a much easier and faster process for a
       mailprocessor and it enables the recipient of the message to have
       some information about the route the message took.

       Because there is no FTS-0001 equivalent to the route-kludge, a
       system that is in a route-kludge needs to be FSC-0058 compliant.
       The intermediate systems to this ROUTE-system need not to be FSC-
       0058 compliant: Our implementation notes assume a list of fsc-0058
       compliant nodes (the 'lookup table'), that is continuously updated,
       when messages arrive from fsc-0058 systems.  When a message is to be
       send on to a non-fsc-0058 system, the message will be converted to
       the old FTS-0001 format, including FMPT-, TOPT- and INTL-kludges.
       The destination-address in this (converted) message will then be the
       address of the first ROUTE-kludge.

       There is one tricky point:  When such a message arrives at this
       ROUTE-system, the message can have TOPT (if the system is a
       pointsystem) and INTL kludges in the messagebody, due to the
       conversion to the FTS-0001 format.  The ROUTE-system's mailprocessor
       will have to find these and strip them from the message.

     * S3 -> S7 :

       These stages perform the conversion to FTS-0001 format, in case the
       next receiving system will be non-fsc-0058 compliant.

     * I3, "ChkTable" :

       Care must be exercized:  If we find FTS-0058 information in a
       message we don't know if the last system, or any of the previous
       systems the message passed is fsc-0058 compliant.  We can only know
       for sure when the message was sent directly to us.  That is (in
       FidoNet packet type 2) when the packet-orig address is the same as
       the message orig-address, or when the packet-orig address is the
       same as the last routd-kludge address.

       We are aware of the fact that the lookup-table won't be filled fast
       this way.  But we don't want that:  We only have to know if our
       'surrounding' nodes, i.e., the nodes with which we have frequent
       connections, support fsc-0058.  We also want to know if gateway
       systems are fsc-0058 compliant, because we have to put them in a
       ROUTE-kludge.  But these should be just a few systems and the fact
     FIDONEWS 14-15               Page 19                  14 Apr 1997


       of their fsc-0058 compliance will be known easily.  They can then be
       added manually.

       We do not even dare to suggest the use of a nodelist-flag, that
       could simplify this whole system of investigating the fsc-0058
       compliance, in order to downgrade to the FTS-0001 level for non-
       compliant systems.
