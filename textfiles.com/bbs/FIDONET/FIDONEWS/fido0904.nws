I have been moderating an echo (RAILFANS) for over a year now, and have
seen it work its way onto the backbone.  The actual execution went
quickly, the big delay was finding all the docs to do it.  And, since I
plan to open up a BBS in a month or two, I want to make sure that this
time I've got all the docs I need.  (We just bought a house and I have
to  finish getting my "playroom" unpacked and straightened out before
I'll let  myself set up a computer.  Once the computer's plugged in, all
housekeeping in the room goes down the tubes...)

So, I've been accumulating a list of various files that "every sysop
should know about" so that when I become a full-fledged public bbs sysop
(instead of just being a pointop), I'll have all the rules and
procedures  and info at my fingertips.  I'd like you all to look over my
list, and  after you've chuckled at my ignorance (go ahead, chuckle,
you're allowed)  let me know which vitally important files I've left
out.

I'm trying to get a list of the NAMES (both magic and otherwise) of
various Fidonet documentation files; in particular, those files that a
moderator or a new sysop should be familiar with. Is there such a list
already available?  If not, can anyone add anything  to  the list I've
compiled so far? So far I'm just trying to identify the file names. If
you have anything to add, *don't* send me the file, just the name and a
brief description of what it is. I'll be freqing them later, after I
know what I'm looking for."

And I definitely want CORRECTIONS to this list - don't be shy!

Jan'92  edition is probably (or definitely) going to be different from
the Dec'92  edition.  Files not flagged with an asterisk are also
subject to change,  but are believed more stable (and changes are
subject to approval).  Mostly policy documents.

I hope that somebody already thought of this a long time ago, and
there's already a list like this... but if not, let's put it together!

The assistance of Tony Davis, Paul Knupke Jr., Robert Williamson, Greg
Edwards, and others whose names I've misplaced, is gratefully
acknowledged.

News of the ANEWS Echo
By Randy Edwards, 1:128/105.0

   A couple of years ago I got sick of hearing about the fact
that the USA Today newsrag had decided to go online and to
charge Sysops for the fluffy tripe they call news, and I
wondered what I could do to bring some different perspectives
of news to people.

   After some thought and talking with some people I decided to
start the ANEWS -- an acronym for Alternative News -- echo.

FidoNews 9-04                  Page 4                      27 Jan 1992


   The echo started out small, with just some random postings
from various alternative newspapers around the country.  Over
time though, it's grown and changed.  There were some periods
when ANEWS carried 80 or more news stories per day, but it's
calmed down now to a more reasonable 10-20 for the last few
months.

   ANEWS isn't for everyone.

   Given the fact that our corporate mass media leans to the
political right, ANEWS, being an alternative news echo, leans to
the political left.  ANEWS also doesn't follow the corporate
media's definition of the politlcal spectrum, you know,
"left = liberal" and "right = conservative."  ANEWS recognizes
the political spectrum as quite a bit further to the right and
left, respectively.

   To be an ANEWS reader you should be willing to have some
preconceptions challenged, and to have an open mind.

   Looking over some of the news stories we've had run in ANEWS
over the last week or so and one will find an interesting
hodge-podge of stories and views.  For example:

 - An editorial piece from the Cuban daily newspaper Granma
telling the Cuban side of the story of anti-Cuban terrorists
landing and being captured in Cuba.

 - A legislative update from the Friends (Quaker Church)
Committee on National Legislative.

 - News articles describing GM's attempt to pit GM workers at
one factory against another by threatening to close one of two
factories and then waiting to see which group of workers will
take the biggest pay and benefit cuts.

 - The story of three Mennonite Church workers arrested in
Haiti.

 - Human rights reports on terror by the goverment of Guatemala.

 - Stories of violence in Russia as people burn the houses and
cars of the newly rich class in protest.

 - Reports of the US economy with angles -- such as the plight
of the homeless and poor, unemployed workers resulting from
factories closing in order to move out of the US -- that are
routinely ignored by the US corporate mass media.

   And the list goes on and on with more stories being posted
every day.  Some stories will shock you, some will surprise you,
some will anger you -- guaranteed!

FidoNews 9-04                  Page 5                      27 Jan 1992


   The ANEWS echo is available on the Zone 1 FidoNet backbone
and this news -- unlike the pay system that USA Today uses --
is FREELY available to anyone willing to link into ANEWS.

Hope to see you all in ANEWS soon!

zone besides zone 1) please let me know.  Thanks.

SysOp, The Graphics WorkShop BBS, 1:123/57 (Memphis TN)


Oh no <groan!>, just what the world needs.  Another door...

I would like to announce the availability of OLVIEW - An online GIF
viewer door that runs on (almost) any BBS.  If you have a lot of GIF
traffic on your board this door might be of interest to you.

I run a medium size graphics oriented BBS.  After having countless
callers request a way to view GIFs while online with my board, I decided
to research the possibility of writing a door that would allow a caller
to preview several GIFs at once while online.  The minimum requirements
were: 1) Ease of installation and use on the caller's part.  2) Must be
easy to install, run on (most) BBS software, and be reliable from the
sysop's point of view.  3) Provide the ability to preview several GIFs
in under 5 minutes at 2400 baud (regardless of GIF file size).

With the release of version 4 of Jay Wherley's GIFDESK, this finally
became possible.  OLVIEW uses GIFDESK to create a small GIF file which
can be viewed while downloading (with Bill Parquet's SHOWGIF shareware).
The downsized GIF should take no more than 3-4 minutes to download (at
2400 baud) and will give the receiver a fairly good idea of what the
full fledged GIF file will look like.

Using OLVIEW, it is possible to "preview" several megabytes of GIF files
in only a few minutes; thereby, saving most of the callers limited
online time for downloading only the GIFs of interest.

OLVIEW will allow the user to choose up to four GIF files at once to be
used to make up one downsized (and downloadable) custom GIF file.  This
downsized file may be viewed offline after transfer using a regular GIF
viewer or viewed during the download with SHOWGIF.  In other words, its
a
full-blown 640x480x256 resolution GIF file that has the image of up to
four other GIFs in it.  The OLVIEW door has become a very popular
feature
on my board, saving my callers countless hours spent downloading
unwanted
FidoNews 9-04                  Page 6                      27 Jan 1992


GIFs.

OLVIEW will give the caller a choice of two formats for the created
downsized GIF.  Small (1.5" x 1.5", approx. size on screen) or medium
(2.5" x 2.5").  The actual screen size of each GIF will vary depending
upon the resolution of the source GIF file(s).  OLVIEW will use X, Y,
or Zmodem (DSZ) to transfer the preview GIF with.

The type of BBS software you run is purely a matter of personal
preference.  I purposely wrote OLVIEW to run under DOORWAY so that it
may be installed and run on any BBS type supported by DOORWAY (as most
popular BBS's are).

OLVIEW is freeware and available by FREQing 'OLV100.ZIP' from:

                          OLV100.ZIP  (198k)

                         1:123/57 - USR dual standard

Thank you for your time, and happy BBSing!

                         SEAmail version 1.10

SEAmail version 1.10 is now available.  Anyone wishing a disk update
should contact System Enhancement Associates, Inc.  However, anyone
with SEAmail version 1.02 can upgrade their system FREE OF CHARGE,
electronically.

Simply change to your SEAmail directory and give the command:

    upgrade 102to110

and your system will upgrade itself to version 1.10.  Anyone with
version 1.02 of SEAmail for OS/2 should instead give the command:

    upgrade sm110p


SEAmail version 1.10 incorporates the following changes:

 *  The "yes/no" dialog boxes in CFGEDIT and MAIL no longer pause when
    you select the default answer by pressing "Enter".

FidoNews 9-04                  Page 7                      27 Jan 1992


 *  The network server was leaving DTR low when Caller*ID is used,
    which prevented most modems from answering the phone.  This should
    now be fixed.

 *  Under certain curcumstances, the standard session handler could be
    fooled into thinking that it needed to process an REQ file on an
    inbound call when it really didn't.  This should now be fixed.

 *  A bug was detected in echomail support that could cause messages
    to be placed in the wrong folders.  This should now be fixed.
    Also, echomail support in general has been greatly enhanced, and
    includes a new echomail folder type in MAIL (complete with an
    echomail link editor).

 *  Return receipts and audit trail receipts were being generated with
    no text.  This should now be fixed.

 *  Scroll boxes should now "wrap" properly.  That is, going up from
    the top should now take you to the bottom, and vice versa.

 *  A bug was detected that caused dialog boxes with shadow text to
    work improperly when the shadow text completely filled the input
    area.  This should now be fixed in all cases.

 *  Hitting "tab" to resolve a filename template did not work if there
    was more than one filename template in the input box, or if the
    filename template had a leading exclamation mark.  This should now
    be fixed.

 *  Automatic rerouting to local destinations was not working
    properly.  This should now be fixed.

 *  It is now possible to delete a message while it is packed for
    transmission.  Go into the packet editor (run TWEAKPKT, or hit
    Alt-P while SEAmail is running), select a packet containing the
    message and press Enter to view the packet.  Now highlight the
    message to delete and hit the DEL key.

 *  DIAL now gives a notice at startup telling the user that the INS,
    DEL, and END keys can be used to alter the dialing list.

 *  Null modem connections should now start up easier.  We are
    allowing five seconds for the system on the other end to respond.

 *  Systems that have a null modem as their primary modem no longer
    need to give a destination system for GET, SEND, or POLL.

 *  The DIAL terminal program can now be told to mask parity.  This
    can be useful when calling commercial services such as CompuServe
    and BIX.

FidoNews 9-04                  Page 8                      27 Jan 1992


 *  The DIAL program now has the ability to dump the clipboard to a
    file.  This allows you to save the filenames and comments to help
    remember what you downloaded.  The clipboard must be dumped BEFORE
    you end a terminal session.

 *  The DIAL program was not always "hanging up" at the end of a null
    modem session, hich would leave the other end of the null modem
    cable thinking that it was still connected.  This is now fixed.

 *  The GET and SEND commands would not work for addresses with
    unpublished phone numbers, even when the /X (ignore errors) option
    was given.  This has now been fixed.

 *  MAIL was disregarding editing of the "To:" field during original
    message entry.  This has now been fixed.

 *  Under special circumstances unlikely to happen anywhere but here,
    SECURE1 would undo autorouting of received secured messages.  This
    should now be fixed.

 *  SECURE1 was securing null messages under certain circumstances,
    resulting in real messages being sent where virtual messages were
    intended.  This should now be fixed.

 *  Under certain circumstances where ambiguous pong data was
    received, GroupMail ping reports would omit some participating
    systems.  This has now been fixed.

 *  Sound support has been added for the Sound Blaster card (MS-DOS
    version only).  If your SOUND.CFG file contains a BLASTER command,
    then SEAmail will attempt to use the Sound Blaster speaker for
    playing sounds.

 *  The RENUMBER program can now be used to renumber messages in a
    specified message folder.

 *  NLCOMP no longer deletes node list difference files.  If you are
    using EDITNL by Ben Baker to apply difference files, you should be
    sure to use the /C (cleanup) option.

 *  CFGEDIT now has an explicit installation prompt for use on local
    area networks.

 *  The session handlers would log loss of carrier as an error under
    circumstances where it does not really constitute an error
    condition.  This has not been fixed.

 *  A new program, STATUS.EXE, has been added to give a continuously
    updated report of what the various lines of a multiline system are
    doing.

FidoNews 9-04                  Page 9                      27 Jan 1992


 *  Some people have asked for some way to log the contents of the
    packet database as of a given time.  We have added a new program,
    PACKETS.EXE, to do this.  Its output may be displayed on the local
    console or redirected to a file.

 *  Some programs exhibited truly awful performance on OS/2 machines
    that do not have a mouse installed.  This has now been fixed.

 *  MAIL was using a color combination on the "carbon copies" dialog
    box that was unreadable on many machines.  This has now been
    fixed.


NOTE: There is an error in the UPGRADE.BAT (or UPGRADE.CMD) supplied
on SEAmail version 1.02 disks.  If you have not done so already, then
you should type the command:

    get UPGRADE.ARC from SEA now

and unpack the latest version of the upgrade process before you
attempt to apply the version 1.10 upgrade.

Also, if you have a USR HST modem, then you may want to edit the entry
for SEA in your phone book before you apply the upgrade.  The number
to use for USR HST modems is (201) 473-2853.

Release of Version 3.00 of ARCMAIL


A new version of ARCMAIL is now available for distribution.  This
version is a replacement for ARCMAIL versions 0.60 thru 2.07.  Left
to its own devices, it will function precisely as has the previous
version (2.07), upon whose code it was based.  My thanks to Thom
Henderson for making the code available for this update.

New functionality has been added to version 3.0 that may be of
interest to current users, especially converts to SEAmail and those
who are required to deal with multiple file archive types.  A
configuration file may be used to extend the abilities of ARCMAIL
in the following manner:

   1) Handles file attach messages properly for any of the SEA
      mailer packages.  This includes the older versions (4.1)
      that require an attach message, newer versions (4.5+) that
      require no attach message, and SEAmail, which requires an
      attach message with the filename preceded by a "!" in the
      subject line in order to delete the file after transmission.

FidoNews 9-04                  Page 10                     27 Jan 1992


   2) Allows the selection of either Base36 or "Version 0" extensions
      on a node-by-node basis.  This means that you can handle both
      types on a single ARCMAIL TO pass.

   3) Allows the selection of numerous archive formats for both
      inbound (ARCMAIL FROM) and outbound (ARCMAIL TO) archives,
      selectable on a node-by-node basis.  All archive types can
      be created or extracted as necessary on a single ARCMAIL TO
      or ARCMAIL FROM pass.

      This option is especially important for SEAmail users who are
      otherwise confined to the internal call to ARC that is generated
      by the ARCMAIL verb in ROUTE.CFG.

   4) Both file extension and archiver type defaults can be modified.

Parameters may be used as found in the CONFIG.DOG file, and may be
supplimented by those found in the ARCMAIL.CFG file.  Any parameter
found in the ARCMAIL.CFG file will override that found on a command
line or in the CONFIG.DOG file.

Documentation is provided with the package which may be file requested
via either Bark or *.REQ format to 1:104/114@FidoNet as ARCMAIL3.ARC.
The files are archived in ARC version 6 format.  This package will
also be distributed by SDS on or shortly after 2/1/92.

Questions and suggestions regarding the package should either be
addressed to 1:104/114 via NetMail, or can be addressed in the
ARCMAIL support area set up for the purpose on the BBS.  The number
for the BBS is (303)652-3595, 24hrs, HST/V.32.

                            GENEALOGY and TECHNOLOGY
                             by Charles E. Darnell

         Well, do they really mix?  Yes!  With the help of your
computer.
    Kentucky will celebrate its 200 year birthday in 1992 and many of
our
    counties have things planned with their historical or genealogical
    societies.  While many of our citizens have been doing genealogy
    research for many years few have used the computer to help with the
    research, record keeping or letter writing that's involved.  Our
    younger generations have the knowledge for using the computer; but,
    little interest in genealogy.  Seems we need to mix the two together
in
    order to preserve the next 200 years of our history.

         There is help here in Louisville.  The "Livewire" Bulletin

    Service (BBS) offers the FIDO network genealogy ECHO to everyone who
    would like to log on and use this service.  While you do need a
    computer and a modem most everything else can be obtained from the
BBS.
    Ask a friend to download the shareware program "TELIX" and you have
an
    excellent communications package that even includes the fast ZMODEM
    protocol.  Next, call the Livewire BBS at (502)933-4725 and follow
the
    instructions.  Select the Special Interest Group (SIG) area and view
    the three different forums available.  There's a local area for
queries
    here in Louisville; The FIDO network for connections around the
globe;
    and finally, the Who's Got What (WGW) area.  Try logging on the BBS
a
    couple of times and if that doesn't work call me at (502)499-6848
for
    help.  I'm the genealogy SIG monitor and will try to help any way I
    can.  This service is free and we're trying to build the interest in
    genealogy and the FIDO ECHO capability here in Louisville.  Our
files
    are few, at the moment, but give us a chance and watch us grow.
    Remember Livewire BBS at (502)933-4725; SYSOP:  Allen Prunty.  This
is
    a free BBS service.

------

Note from Allen Prunty, SysOp of the LiveWire BBS.

The LiveWire has a healthy selection of Genealogy files... Feel free to
FREQ FILES from 2320/110 to see what I have, the system will accept 9600
baud calls from any v.32 or HST modem.  You can also FREQ any given file
from the LiveWire BBS.

You can also access Genealogy message bases from both FidoNet and the GT
Network.  We have XRS and QWK compatible doors.  Long distance users
will  be validated within 24 hours.

Services added recently is TMS - Tafel Matching Service which helps you
to  locate other users with information you may need.  You can also
upload  your GEDCOM submissions which will be sent to the LDS church.

You may also want to FREQ GBBSLIST from me for a listing of other
Genealogy BBS's.  There may be one near you.

Tom Feel free to edit this any way you want... you -must- have better
skills at editing than I do or you wouldn't be doing this.

It's time for the leadership of FidoNet (that means, if you hold a title
in FidoNet other than "sysop", this is for you) to hear a little bit
from someone on the short end of their political games.  Normally I
would sign my article, but in this instance I choose not to because I
would like to protect third parties mentioned by office.  If you knew
my address you could track them down.  It is not my purpose to embarass,
but it is my purpose to wake up some sleepers toward the top of the
nodelist.  Not that my effort will have any effect or anything...

o It seems to me that there is a tremendous inertia against change in
  FidoNet.  Any time anyone proposes a change they must implement the
  entire thing from start to finish, and at most they may get "No, you
  should do it this way" for their efforts.

     A prime example is Aaron Goldblatt's nodelist proposal.  He's been
     plugging away at this thing for a few months now, and has now
     released the third revision of his standard.  He sees a problem in
     FidoNet and is attempting to do something about it.

     What has he gotten for his efforts?  Some encouragement from the
     lowly folks without political power, but mostly a lot of poo-pooing
     from the higher-ups (if they deigned to comment at all).  Recently
     a number of articles have appeared in FidoNews saying that the
     nodelist is too big (hey, 277 was 1,087,926 bytes, or 1062k long!),
     and most have suggested general changes (eliminating Pvts, binary
     formats, etc.), but nothing specific.

     But Aaron, together with Will Schlichtman, have not only suggested
     general changes, but they have created an FTSC-type spec document
     and released it to anybody who wants to FREQ it at 1200+ bps.  When
     asked for numerical analysis, Aaron provided it thanks to Will's
     conversion program.  And he carried out this analysis on his
FidoNews 9-04                  Page 13                     27 Jan 1992


     painfully slow 4.77 mHz V20 Zenith Z150 and 66 megabytes of hard
     drive space.

     He's the only person I've seen develop an entire nodelist spec
     document and release it three times, get a conversion program
     created, and do reasonably rigorus statistical analysis of the
     savings the format provides.

     Those of you who want a binary format - how about doing the same?

  If FidoNet is to improve over what we have now, instead of simply
  jumping on the bandwagon trashing someone else's idea, create one of
  your own.  Write specs for it.  That way, instead of a few people
  doing all the work, everyone contributes and the whole thing comes out
  better.  Aaron commented on it in FidoNews 806 - information and idea
  exchange is the purpose of FidoNet.

o There is an increasing attitude of NoSlow in FidoNet.  Sysops,
  pointops, and users who have modems which run slower than 9600 are
  increasingly subjected to criticism by their peers and others because
  of the slower speed of their hardware.  Examples:

     A net in Zone 1 recently had a discussion about limiting echomail
     distribution based on modem speed - the slower your modem, the less
     mail you could get.  The idea eventually died, but there was some
     very bitter debate about it.  On one side you saw the 1200 and 2400
     bps people, and on the other you had the HSTs, DSs, V.32s, PEPs,
     H96s, and CSPs.

     Many nets have a hub-based mail distribution scheme.  But those who
     want to become a hub must have a 9600 bps modem and run CM.  I can
     understand the CM requirement, but what's wrong with a 2400 bps hub
     feeding other 2400 systems?  Yes, SOMEWHERE there will have to be a
     2400 <==> 9600 link, but since most nets bring mail in from long
     distance at 9600, that could be at the local level where costs are
     smallest.

     One pointop I talked to felt that he was constantly belittled
     because of his lack of fast hardware, a situation he has been
     working to try and correct but lacks funds to do so.  His bossnode
     went to 2400+ only for human callers, so he could file request and
     get mail from his boss, but not log in as a human caller.

  Guys, an HST hooked to a 386/33 or Mac IIfx is kind of like raising
  big horses.   Tain't cheap.  It seems like those who favor rules
  like echomail restrictions are the ones who would be least affected by
  them.  We don't all have a modem that can do 100k in less than 60
  seconds, nor do we have the funds to pay for one.  And
  -=* OCCASIONALLY *=- there is the pointop who pulls 400k of mail a day
  at 1200 bps and wants an HST, but can't afford retail on one because
  he doesn't qualify for the sysop deal - you gotta have a BBS for that,
FidoNews 9-04                  Page 14                     27 Jan 1992


  remember?

o Lack of information distribution to those affected seems to be a
  problem as well.  I am an active participant in several international
  confrences, and the departure of Felix Kasza from FidoNet was a
  surprise to me, if for no other reason than I didn't know who he was
  or what he did.

  Felix was an example of the FidoNet unsung hero - someone whose work
  (often on their own dime) goes unnoticed by the vast majority of
  people who benefit.  I can understand how Felix could get burnt out -
  I've thought more than once about saving about ten megabytes and
  deleting every bit of FidoNet and BBS-related material from my system.

  Not only did I not know who he was, I didn't hear about it from
  anybody in the *C structure, through which our information is supposed
  to come, right?

  Instead, I heard it from the Zone 2 moderator of the INTERUSER
  echo, and only by chance at that - I was doing a name search for
  "Moderator" looking for the Zone 1 moderator.  There was no note about
  it in FidoNews 839 - I did a text search for his name and my computer
  just beeped at me..."Kasza not found!"

Is it just me or do we have a problem here?

The nickname of Fight-o-Net seems to be true.  I'm not going to say that
I didn't expect some politiking when I joined, but some of this stuff is
insane.  Take a look at Pablo Kleinman's article in Fnews 840.  I don't
know anything about the Zone 1 <> Zone 4 zonegate service embargo -
again, this didn't come to me through the *C structure (and I DO
pull and read the local sysop information echo) - but I've seen such
things happen on a smaller scale, and am not really surprised to see it
on an international level.

But I think it's deplorable.

I wasn't surprised to see Pablo's charge that his offer of providing
Zonegating services was declined for political reasons.  It happens
where I am all the time.  A pointop I know wanted to help in an
emergency hub crash situation.  His offers, unsolicited by anyone and
made with the best of intentions, drew what amounted to flames by
members of his net.

Next time you make a comment - any comment, think about it first.

o Echomail distribution is WAAAY too political.  I'm from Zone 1, but
  I've heard reports from very reliable people that there's a big
  political flap in Zone 2 over echomail payments to TAP.  Feeds to
  entire regions may get cut because some people demand payment for
  something that -= USED =- to be a hobby.

FidoNews 9-04                  Page 15                     27 Jan 1992


  I agree that cost distribution is fair - it's a common practice here
  in Zone 1, too.  But it ought to be done on the net level, not on the
  region level.  There are many places where echos are fed from one
  region to another on a passthru basis, and cutting feeds to the link
  would be unfair.  For example, a lot of echomail that flows into
  Estonia goes through Finland.  Cut Finland's feed and what happens to
  Estonia?

o Someone commented in a recent FidoNews that we should get rid of all
  the politickers (was it Pablo Klienman?).  I am inclined to agree.
  When I became a user of a FidoNet BBS about three years ago the same
  people were running it as they do now.  It's true that in my region
  we've changed RCs once and RECs twice, but it's still the same old
  gang.  The only thing that's different are the titles.

  I'm tempted to list the people I'm thinking of by name, but will not.
  It is enough to say that they now hold positions of considerable
  political power within FidoNet - and they have made more than one node
  uncomfortable.

  All of the political crap is driving very good people out of the
  network, as well.  Felix Kasza is the most obvious example that I know
  of, but also a former NC of a network I'm near.  This NC resigned his
  position (he retains his node address), in part, as a protest to the
  outcome of a policy complaint filed by him and 27 other individuals.
  It was rejected, not only on the basis of a technicality (according to
  POLICY4 only 3 of the 31 signatures were valid) but also for purely
  political reasons.  As I read the response closely I realized that the
  complaint was rejected not because on a basis in POLICY4, but because
  of the lack of a policy covering echomail (the partial subject of the
  complaint).  It seems to me that the result was merely protection of
  someone already holding considerable power within Zone 1.

Someone, in a netmail comment, summed up what's going on, and I think
the shoe fits.  He requested that he not be identified, but I will say
that he's a sysop somewhere in Zone 1 (THAT'S a big help, ain't it!).

      Fidonet dies, slowly and painfully, because of all this
      bureaucratic nonsense.  Next thing we won't even be allowed to
      send netmail direct to someone outside our own net.

It's time to cut out the bull and get back to where we started - a group
(okay, a huge group) of people having a good time together.

Comments are welcome if you can find me, but please route flames to
1:1/NUL.  Have a nice day.
