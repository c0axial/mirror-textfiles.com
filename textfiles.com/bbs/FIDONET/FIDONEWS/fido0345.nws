                                 What's Up?


     I can't stand it.  I've tried my best to be a good  boy.  Shortly
     after  the  conference in Colorado Springs several people told me
     that I should hold back and not express my opinions,  but  should
     wait for a general consensus to develop without me.

     But  to  quote the immortal Popeye,  "That's all I can stands,  I
     can't stands no more!"

     Right off the bat,  yes,  a great many mistakes were made,  and I
     made my own share of them.  What can I say?  I don't really think
     that  anyone  really  realized  just how many seriously concerned
     people there are out there.  I am quite pleased  at  the  breadth
     and  depth of feeling that exists in the FidoNet community,  even
     though it may have been painful to experience at times!

     I suspect that quite a lot of us now realize that  FidoNet  (like
     much  of  the  software  that  spawned it) is growing to be a far
     greater  thing than anyone would have thought even so recently as
     this time last year.  We are  now  being  taken  quite  seriously
     indeed  by many outside groups.  We are coming to have a presence
     in the market and in the industry that cannot be ignored.

     And the International FidoNet Association,  like it  or  not,  is
     being  recognized  as the visible manifestation of that presence.
     IFNA is by no means ready for  the  sort  of  attention  that  is
     already  being  focused  on it by the various trade publications,
     trade groups, manufacturers,  and so on.  But as time passes,  we
     grow and we learn.

     Many  people  within  FidoNet  have  expressed concern over IFNA.
     Will  this  legal  fiction,  this  corporate person,  that we are
     creating be what we want, or will it be a Frankenstein's Monster?
     I personally feel that it will  help.  The  sysop  has  generally
     been  a  much ignored and much maligned figure,  bringing visions
     (if anything at all) of hackers working away in  their  basements
     to  bring  about  World  War  III.  IFNA  would give us a central
     source that the media could go to  for  information  and  advice,
     through  which we could express our own opinion of the sysop as a
     dedicated volunteer performing a public service.

     Review of FlickerFree 11/2/86
     D. Ellison
     Fido 18/4

                         FlickerFree, A User Review

     FlickerFree  is  a  memory  resident  utility  to   "dramatically
     increase  text  display performance".  This it does...remarkably.
     Some of the other claims made in the advertising is not quite  as
     accurate.  The  program was tested on an IBM-PC under PC-DOS 3.1.
     The quotes come from their current advertising.

     "DRAMATICALLY INCREASE TEXT  DISPLAY  PERFORMANCE".
     The  program  delivers!  Scrolling  speed with the DIR command is
     truly impressive.  Also the TYPE command scrolls  the  file  with
     dizzying speed.  Not mentioned is that if you use the MORE filter
     when  typing  the file to screen,  FlickerFree is disabled so you
     lose the speed advantage.  This limits  the  usefullness  of  the
     program.

     "ELIMINATES THAT ANNOYING SCROLLING FLICKER".
     It's true,  the flicker is gone completely.  If  you  don't  mind
     flicker,  you can speed scrolling even more by selecting a faster
     scrolling mode from the FlickerFree menu.

     "CONTROL DOS FOREGROUND AND BACKGROUND COLORS"
     Again,  the program does allow easy selection of screen colors as
     long  as  FlickerFree  is  on.  What  isn't  mentioned is that it
     disables the ANSI.SYS driver.  If you use imbedded codes in files
     or if you call any bulletin boards that use them,  you'll see the
     escape codes and not the colors.

     "100% COMPATIBLE WITH ALL PCs, COMPATIBLES, AND WITH ALL OTHER
     MEMORY RESIDENT UTILITIES"
     The  program  falls  down  a  bit on this one.  The documentation
     states that it  isn't  compatible  with  PC-WRITE  or  SMARTCOMM.
     Oddly  enough,  the  documentation  that  came  with  FlickerFree
     describing the incompatibility with PC-WRITE is dated June 86 but
     their October ads still claim 100%  compatibility.  They  provide
     another  program that will automatically disable any incompatible
     program if their FFIX.COM is run first against  the  incompatible
     program.  There is a problem,  though.  If you do as they say and
     FFIX ED.EXE,  then run ED.EXE (PC-WRITE's editor)  PC-WRITE  runs
     normally until you try to use the DOS shell within PC-WRITE.  You
     can  go  to  DOS  but  the machine locks up when you EXIT back to
     PC-WRITE.  You can turn FlickerFree off by typing FF off  at  the
     command  line  but  the  program seems to remain in memory.  Even
     with FlickerFree off,  I lost a  document  when  trying  to  exit
     PC-WRITE.  Even  worse than the problem with PC-WRITE is that the
     program seems to have difficulty with Fido.  I found  Fido  would
     crash  unpredictably  after  FlickerFree  had  been loaded.  Each
     time, this required a cold boot.  Unfortunately,  cold boots with
     a  hard disk can cause data loss because the heads aren't parked.
     I spent the afternoon reformatting my hard disk.

     The ad quotes Peter  Norton  in  his  6-86  PC  Magazine  article
     Fidonews                     Page 5                   24 Nov 1986


     claiming  FlickerFree  "...solves  several  problems that muck up
     display screens:  snow, flicker, and lack of speed...".  When you
     read the documentation, they claim Peter Norton was mistaken when
     he  said  the program eliminates snow.  It seems a bit misleading
     to quote someone about your program when you clearly know him  to
     be mistaken.

     "FULL, MONEY-BACK, SATISFACTION GUARANTEE"
     I  sent  them  their  program  back for a refund.  This guarantee
     makes the program well worth a try.  If you are  annoyed  by  the
     flicker  and  slow  pace of your display,  FlickerFree may be the
     answer.  If you run a Fido BBS or use PC-WRITE,  you'll  want  to
     keep their satisfaction guarantee in mind.

     Dear Sysops,

             As a senior at Franklin Pierce College in Rindge, New
     Hampshire, I am majoring in Marketing, within the Division of
     Business Administration.  In order to graduate, each business
     student must complete an independent study project which results
     in the completion of research and the writing of a formal
     research paper.  This thesis must be defended before the faculty
     and administration of the college.

             The thesis topic I have chosen is Fidonet.  I am
     investigating its marketing potential and as part of that
     investigation, I also need to identify and quantify the various
     types of users of FIDONET.  I have therefore designed two
     questionnaires - one for sysops and one for users.  Your
     assistance is urgently needed in order to obtain this
     information.

          The first questionnaire is for sysops.  Please use your word
     processor to answer the questions and return it to me via 101/27
     (Dave's Fido in Gardner, MA) under the name Lyndalee Foster, or
     simply print it out and send the completed survey to:

                 Lyndalee Foster
                 P.O. Box 360
                 Franklin Pierce College
                 Rindge, NH 03461

          It would also be very helpful if you could send me a file
     which simply contains the opening screens and menus on your
     system.

          The survey for users follows the survey for sysops.  Please
     make it available to all your users as is.  Directions to the
     user describe the purpose of the study and how they should
     respond.

          Please try to respond by November 20 as the results are
     urgently needed in order for me to complete my thesis on time.
     The results of the survey have to be coded, tabulated, analyzed,
     and reported in the thesis by December 3.  I have tried to obtain
     this information through public sources but so far without
     success.  If you know of any sources which address the questions
     which are in my survey, please let me know.  Since I have been
     unable to find the information, I would be most appreciative if
     you could help me.

            Thank-you for your time and consideration.

                                                  Sincerely,
                                                  Lyndalee Foster

     Robert E. Spivack
     Sysop Spiv's Fido 143/3
     Sillicon Valley Net 143 Host
     (408) 247-3296

     Greetings  fellow  Sysops and Fido Users.   It has been  a  while
     since I last wrote a column for Fidonews, but so much is going on
     it is time to comment.

     I.   Mark  Welch's problems with PC-SIG (tm):   Mark -- I support
     your position and hope that you plan to put your education  (U.C.
     Law)  to  work ASAP to fight those *@$@%%#!   (I  recall  reading
     somewhere you were now attending law school.)

     II.   Commercial Fidonet:  I don't care what you call it, how you
     structure it, whether the goals are noble or not, but FORCING any
     kind of charge for Fidonet (being in the nodelist, being serviced
     by a national or regional host, etc.) just isn't a hobby anymore.

     Instead  of worrying about some Fido's (SUCH AS MINE) that  might
     drop  out  and how that would affect the net,  why don't all  you
     money-hungry  anti-hobbiests JUST DROP OUT NOW AND FORM YOUR  OWN
     COMMERCIAL  NET IN THE FIRST PLACE!   (How's that for turning the
     tables with an interesting suggestion)

     III.   Commercial tag-along "points":  A recent Fidonews (#339, I
     think)  carried a proposal for extending the hierarchical routing
     beyond zone:net/node to include subnodes called points.  Although
     I  think the motivation is wrong (to faciliate  commercial  nodes
     and  payments) the concept of "points" is interesting.

     I  would  like  to  propose  an  alternate  use.    "Points",  or
     degenerate nodes, could be used for individuals that want to link
     to  the  Fido  network but do not want to set  themselves  up  as
     nodes.   Essentially, these are casual users that might be online
     for several weeks,  disappear for a month or two,  etc.  "Points"
     are  maintained  only by the local node as private extentions  to
     the nodelist  (That is already possible using the XLATLIST option
     for a private nodelist.)

     The  real value of "points" is that it allows someone  (Shareware
     authors,  are you listening?) to create a single-user  simplified
     Fido package that simply allows a user to create Fidonet messages
     offline  and  send/receive  them to/from their  supporting  node.
     This  creates  a  form  of electronic  mail  where  "points"  are
     primarily involved with sending messages to/from other Fido users
     (either normal nodes or other "points").

     The  key  is  that the supporting node HOLDS  all  mail  for  the
     "point"  until  the "point" calls (polls) to receive  it.   Since
     this mini Fido program is limited in function,  it would be small
     enough   to  fit  on  a  floppy  disk  and  be  usable   with   a
     portable/laptop computer, maybe even implemented on a Z80 machine
     like the Tandy 100, etc.

     Finally,  since  "points" are users without the responsibility of
     Fidonews                     Page 13                  24 Nov 1986


     having  their  nodes  up 24 hours a day (or  even  every  day  at
     Fidomail  time),  anyone  that wants to join Fidonet but  doesn't
     have the time,  money,  dedicated phone line,  or discipline  can
     still  participate rather than join as a full fledged node and be
     counted among the "missing, lost dogs, or disappearing" nodes.

     Just like the original proposal,  the real benefit/simplification
     of  "points"  is  that  the  list of them  is  not  compiled  and
     circulated  with the nodelist.   "Points" are like real  Ma  Bell
     phone  numbers,  you gotta know them to call them and any  "Phone
     Books"  available  are published as a favor,  not a  requirement.
     (I.E.   users  can voluntarily exchange their  "point"  addresses
     and/or publish their own phone directories,  but the operation of
     Fidonet  and "points" does not REQUIRE it.   Thus,  no additional
     overhead to IFNA, Fido 1/0, et. al.)

     IV.   Echomail  - I must admit,  although quite technical myself,
     I've  waited  too  long and only recently  started  joining  this
     FANTASTIC facility.   I'm glad that ideas are being generated for
     bringing order to this wildly growing feature and at the risk  of
     covering  ground  that may already have been  discussed,  let  me
     propose a few simple things:

     A  controlled list of Echomail conferences should be compiled and
     distributed on a weekly basis listing the name of the conference,
     the conference coordinator, and a short description.  This may or
     may not be distributed WITH the weekly nodelist update.

     A  more  formal  acknowledgement of a  second  kind  of  Echomail
     capability  should be made.   I'll coin the term "Broadcast" mail
     to refer to the desire for one user or Sysop or send a message to
     many  systems  and  have the message  "tossed"  into  a  specific
     message  area.   The easiest example is trading/selling something
     we no longer want.   If I want to sell a hard disk,  modem board,
     or  even  a  bicycle,  I would like to broadcast  (should  I  say
     carefully  execute a "bombing run") to many boards and  have  the
     message appear in an area reserved for it.   Most likely, many of
     us have a message area called "FORSALE".

     All that is needed is for the most common ones (For Sale, Wanted,
     Gossip, News, etc.) to be assigned standard NAMES and have a list
     compiled  showing  which nodes have  them.   Thus,  a  Robot-like
     utility  could  then send Fidonet mail only to those  nodes  that
     have  a  message  area (an implicitly then are saying its  ok  to
     forward the message to me) on that topic.

     Note that the default Fidonet area is a degenerate case.   We all
     know we can send a message to any Fido and have it be received in
     its  Fidonet message area,  however,  many systems  restrict  the
     Fidonet area to only certain classes of users.

     V.  Fido enhancements - Boy, we all have lots of ideas here, I'll
     try to restrict myself to a few things which may benefit a lot of
     Sysops.   Again,  I apologize if some of these are already  being
     addressed by the next revision or have already been shot down.

     Fidonews                     Page 14                  24 Nov 1986


     International  - I  hope  the "country" stuff will  make  Fidonet
     smarter and simply refuse to deliver mail directly to a node that
     has an incompatible modem.   Right now,  it is up to the Sysop to
     manually remember which systems just can't receive using US  Bell
     std modems.  I know that I would spare the $$ to dial up our non-
     US friends,  it is the modems,  not the bucks that is keeping the
     ocean a barrier for many of us.

     Nodelist   Processing   - It  seems  strange  to  me   that   the
     NODELIST.IDX  file  is bigger than the NODELIST.BBS  itself.   It
     might  be  interesting to include parameters inside  Fido  itself
     that  obsolete  the XLATLIST stuff.   I mean,  instead  of  batch
     converting canonical phone numbers to local dialing  codes,  etc.
     why not just include the parameters inside Fido (or via a control
     file)  so  that Fido converts a phone number on the fly  when  it
     uses  it  to  dial.   It would only take less than  a  second  to
     convert one phone number in real time,  rather than forcing us to
     endure ever-longer xlatlist,routegen sessions.

     Independent  Message  and  File  Areas  - I  think  the  original
     thinking for having each SYSTEMnn.BBS file describe a message and
     a file area needs a revision.  I know that many Fidos do not have
     pairs  of  areas.   (I.E.   very few Fidos actually have  a  UNIX
     message area with a UNIX file area; a DOS message area with a DOS
     file  area;  etc.)   This pairing makes setting  privileges  very
     difficult  because often you want to disable access to a  message
     area but allow access to the file area.  Right now, you've got to
     juggle  them around and re-pair up different areas to get  around
     this.

     User  Privileges by Area - One of the biggest suggestions I  keep
     hearing  is to enlarge the USER password file to allow specifying
     for each user which file or message areas they can access.   This
     would  provide  a much richer more granular way  to  control  the
     system.   Right  now,  all you can do is define classes of  users
     (twit,   normal,  extra,  sysop,  etc.)  and  then  assign  class
     attributes  to  file/message areas.   Today,  you can't have  two
     users  each  the  same  class (normal or  extra)  with  each  one
     restricted to DIFFERENT message areas.   (Note:   Since there can
     be  up  to 99 areas,  a reasonable restriction might be  to  only
     allow room for 10 or 20 areas that can be controlled this way)

     Whew! and I thought all I was gonna write was two sentences..!

     Sounds  like  a joke,  doesn't it?   This guy can't  possibly  be
     trying  to  assert  prior claim over the  Echomail  conference  I
     founded,  can he?  Well,  I've been trying for a while now to get
     through  to  Mr.  Gentry,  and he has yet to reply to ANY  of  my
     messages  on the subject in the Echomail areas where the  offense
     took  place.   And that's close enough to a legal notice that I'm
     worried.
     _________________________________________________________________

     I, Brad Hicks,  sysop of Fido 100/523, renounce the copyright no-
     tice excerpted above.    Thomas Gentry  is a newcomer to the con-
     ference,  and cannot demonstrate ANY  WAY in which he has contri-
     buted  to  the concept,  creation,  or operation  of  the  MAGICK
     Echomail conference prior to the entry of this message.  Further,
     existing documents,  both  paper  and  electronic, verify that I,
     along  with  Josh Gordon (sysop of Fido 161/93)   and  Dave  Rene
     (sysop of Fido 101/27,  aka Fido  101/0)  are the originators and
     creators of the MAGICK Echomail Conference.   Our contribution is
     visible  and significant,  both in distribution and in authorship
     of messages.

     Therefore let it be  know to  all  that  the MAGICK Echomail con-
     ference  is  PUBLIC DOMAIN,  and not property of  any  person  or
     organization.    Neither  the name,  nor the  concept,   nor  the
     structure may be claimed to be owned by any person.   The  public

     the addressees.
     _________________________________________________________________

     It is possible that Mr.  Gentry thinks he is trying to  "protect"
     us  by keeping unscrupulous operators from claiming ownership  of
     our  material  and by some arcane legality charging us money  for
     our own names, or something.  Oh well, I  suppose stranger things
     have  happened  (anybody who knows the history of  Fantasy  Role-
     Playing  games knows what I'm talking about).   But the sysop  of
     136/200  should NOT have taken this action without consulting ME,
     whom  he knew full well to be the founder and coordinator of this
     conference.    Far  from it!   And I suspect he didn't  warn  the
     coordinators of any of the OTHER conferences (such as BIBLE) that
     he tried to "land-grab".   And I do NOT consider myself protected
     by Mr.  Gentry's claim that he OWNS MY  WORDS--"sole property  of
     Thomas Gentry ... (c) 1986," it says here.  I am therefore taking
     direct  action to protect myself and  the  other members  of  the
     MAGICK conference from prosecution by  returning "ownership"   of
     their words to where it belongs,  and where any sane  court would
     have ruled it was before this obnoxious entry: the public domain.

     If  Mr.  Gentry really does think he can get away  with  claiming
     full, sole ownership over my words and work, he had better retain
     an  attorney and prosecute his claim,  because I will CONTINUE to
     distribute  this conference as I see fit,  as I have done for six
     months now.   I  hate to put it in these terms,  but remember,  I
     didn't start this fight.  Should it become a legal battle,  I in-
     vite, I  BEG all Fido Sysops (and IFNA) to assist me in defending
     me against take-over of my work and words.

     I  may be contacted via FidoNet at my own address of 100/523,  or
     via U.S. Mail to:  J. Brad Hicks, 3900 Roland, Apartment B, Saint
     Louis, Missouri 63121, United States of America.  Thank you.

     Howard Feil
     User of The Heart of Gold 109/624
     October 23, 1986

        The Brian Walsh Logical T's FRAUDULENT Contest


     In mid August of 1986 Brian Walsh, sysop of Logical
     Technologies FidoNet 109/640, ran a contest under the
     name of Computerland.  The contest stated that the first
     person to upload 100 public domain files would win a 1200
     baud Hayes Compatible Modem.  I, Howard Feil, was later
     informed by Brian that I was the "winner" of the contest
     he ran under name of Computerland.

     At this point Computerland Bulletin Board had gone down;
     however, Brian had started a new board with the SAME
     fidonet numbers 109/640 only under the name of Logical
     Technologies.  It was in a data conversation with Brian
     on this board that I learned I had "won" the modem that
     it would be mailed to me by UPS after he received the
     modem on Friday, September 5, 1986, and during this same
     data conversation Brian also informed me that all the
     programs uploaded to the Computerland Board had been
     lost.  It should be noted here that I was under the
     impression that the Hard Disk the BBS was running on
     hadn't been backed up although Brian later informed me
     that this was not true.  He informed me that he had
     absolutely no idea where on earth the software for his
     Tape Backup system was (I'm assuming it didn't occur to
     him to put it on his Hard Disk), and the floppies he had
     backup the Hard Disk had been taken by someone else in
     the store.  (Computerland)  I offered to bring the
     software to Brian on Floppy disks to Computerland where
     he was working at the time, and he would mail them back
     with the Modem I rightly deserved.  Brian was out on a
     service call at the time so I gave the disks to another
     person at Computerland and had them give the disks to
     Brian.  He later informed by Fido Mail that he did
     receive the disks.

     I NEVER received the modem or my floppies from Brian.  On
     September 28, 1986, I had my last data conversation with
     Brian of any length  His parting words explained what had
     happened (This is a direct screen capture.)

     I sold IT since then because I had NO intentions of EVER
     giving you one until about 10mins.  ago.  talk to you
     toimmorrow, Bye.

     Brian had agreed to order another modem at this time
     (so he said) and was going to call me tomorrow and also
     agreed to call me on two more occasions.  He never did.
     I never received the modem I rightly deserved.  I never
     received the eight floppy disks I lent to him.  Brian
     Walsh has Conducted a FRAUDULENT Contest.  He has never
     Fidonews                     Page 18                  24 Nov 1986


     denied this and he appears to have planned it all along.

     I was informed on the phone by Son of the Owner of
     Computerland that Computerland had no knowledge that
     Brian Walsh had operated a BBS under the name of
     Computerland and that Brian Walsh was fired from
     Computerland for selling "products we don't even carry."
     Brian Walsh denies this stating that he resigned, and he
     had a written copy of his resignation.  I would prefer
     not to comment on which story is true for I have no hard
     evidence for either story.

     I justly "won" the modem in a public contest sponsored by
     Brian Walsh.  All I asked of Brian Walsh, was to be give
     the modem that I am entitled to and the disks I lent him
     which are my own personal property.  He has never done so
     and has given no indication that he is going to
     compromise on the issue in anyway; not even in returning
     the disks I lent to him.  I have persistently asked Brian
     questions on this issue, and all he has done, is deleted
     my messages.

     I formally request that Brian Walsh sysop of Logical
     Technologies 109/640's future in FidoNet be considered by
     the members of FidoNet as to whether or not they want
     members who have conducted Fraudulent Contests.

     Any Comments to this article can be sent to Howard Feil
     on FidoNet 109/624.

     Jin Tan
     Fido 107/701


                        MultiTech 224EH (with MNP)

          This  is a plea to owners of the above modem who  have  run
     Fido during mail hours without ANY problems. I need to know your
     dip switch settings as well as your Fidomdm.bbs contents. I have
     tried Modem_Help_East, Tech Echomail as well as MultiTech but to
     no avail. This is my last resort!

          I  am  having problems getting Fido (11w) to work with  the
     224EH.  The  problem I am having is getting the modem to  answer
     2400 baud calls during Mail hours.  Error message on my end says
     it  is  waiting for sync and that it is not a  Fidonet.  On  the
     callers' log,  they see a "no response to whacking CR"  message.
     This problem is especially severe (100% of the time) for a Hayes
     2400 and moderate (50%) for the USR Courier.  I have tried nume
     rous  suggestions  including adding "AT&Q1" in  the  Fidomdm.bbs
     file.  I also tried 1/J, 11/J, 5/J as well as AT&E0 (no MNP). My
     PROM version is 2.09. This problem exists ONLY during Mail hour.

          Despite the above problem,  I am still very happy with  the
     MultiTech  modem.  The servicing policy is Excellent.  (Once,  I
     sent  in  two  modems  (a Hayes and a  MultiTech)  back  to  the
     manufacturer  to be repaired.  The MultiTech took  1  week;  the
     Hayes  took 2 months.  The techical support personnel know their
     modems VERY well (too bad they don't know Fido). And the special
     sysops' price for the modem just can't be beat!


          Thanking you in anticipation.

     Now don't anyone feel sorry for me because I don't feel bad about
     this.....


     I have had a lot of fun running this Bulletin board and now I  am
     to a point where I am rearranging my priorities.  As part of this
     I will be retiring from the Sysop business.  I appreciate all the
     support  that  the  users of Allen's Board have contributed;  you
     have made it very rewarding for me.

     Jesse Armontrout,  Fido 108/64,  will be the new  Cincinnati  Net
     Host.  If  anyone needs assistance of a Net Host,  contact Jesse.
     He is very capable and I am sure he  will  do  a  good  (probably
     better) job of Host.

     Once again, thanks.
     Regards, Allen Miller

     Daniel Tobias
     Soft Fido, 19/216

     I have just released a new program that lets Fido sysops run
     online games and activities with a running scoreboard.  This is
     a feature present in some other BBS systems, such as NoChange,
     and is very popular with users of such systems.  Users compete
     to become System Champion, and can see a display of the top ten
     scores at any time.

     The SCOREKEEPER program, downloadable as the file SCOREKPR.ARC
     in file area 6 of SOFT FIDO [(318) 636-4402, 24 hours, 300 or
     1200 baud], works in the OUTSIDE section of your system.  It is
     fully compatible with either OUTSIDE or OUTER, and probably any
     other Outside menu program you might be using.  The scores are
     kept in a standard ASCII file (the data format is documented in
     the accompanying text), so you can write games and other
     programs of your own which manipulate this data.

     SCOREKEEPER includes a routine to find the current user's score
     and move it to a short file CURRSCOR.BBS for easy access by
     other programs, when the user enters the Outside section;
     another routine to replace this score data in the master score
     file (SCORES.BBS) when the user leaves the Outside section, to
     save any changes in his or her score; commands to increase or
     decrease the current user's score; and a command to output the
     current top ten.  Instructions are included showing you how to
     use SCOREKEEPER on your system.

     I plan on releasing game programs designed to work with
     SCOREKEEPER in the future.  Right now, I have "The Numbers
     Game", downloadable from Soft Fido as NUMBERS.ARC, which is a
     "lottery"-style drawing with some interesting twists.

     Once again, our number is (318) 636-4402; our FidoNet node
     number is 19/216.  Check us out; we also have a wide selection
     of other Fido utilities available for download, and no pre-
     registration is needed for download access.

     Ken McVay
     Fido 138/45

                                 WORD.DBF

     In 1983, I began to assemble a database which will, in time,
     contain the entire Bible. The project was begun using an
     Osborne-1 and dBASEII, and was upgraded to dBASEIII in 1985.

     I began the project on the assumption that by the time it was
     completed, the equipment required to utilize it would have
     become inexpensive enough that small congregations could readily
     afford it. It was assumed that the need for automated accounting
     and congregational record-keeping would provide the impetus
     which would lead to the purchase of an XT or compatible. At
     that point, I felt that the usefulness of the datafile would
     make the purchase of dBASEIII worthwhile.

     The Bible was already available in one version at the time the
     project began, but dBASEIII offered advantages which were NOT
     available, to wit, the ability to append commentaries through
     the MEMO field - including sermons relating to specific verses,
     citations from biblical dictionaries and commentaries, etc.

     After browbeating a few friends, active in the Christian
     Community, who were also PC owners, I managed to solicit some
     help, and the file grew apace.

     The file structure includes a field for VERSION, which permits
     the file to contain differing versions of the same books, for
     comparisons which would not be possible in commercial bible
     databases. 90% of the work presently available has been done
     using Beck's New American Translation, with the balance from
     the Good News Bible. About 75% of the NT is presently avail-
     able through 138/45, and is found in WORD.ARC. Individual files
     (books) are also available.

     I would deeply appreciate volunteers to help in this work. Fido
     has made it possible to seek them. Those willing to add a chap-
     ter or two are invited to contact me, so that I can co-ordinate
     the work and avoid needless duplication. Those who send me a
     new book at their expense will receive the entire project file
     at my expense...more than a fair trade!

     WORD.ARC also contains two crude command files to facilitate
     creating new files and searches. A dBASE programmer I am not,
     and I would be delighted if someone out there would provide me
     with a menu-driven command file which could be useful to non-
     computer types, enabling searches, comparisons, appending
     commentaries without entering manual commands, etc.

     The following data file structure must be created with dBASEII
     (minus the memo file) or dBASEIII:

                                 WORD.DBF
     FN      FIELD           TYPE    SIZE

     typed by Infect

      Note: The following article was typed in from the October/
     November issue of THRASHER magazine, page 75.

                          In The Crowd: Tom Jennings

          The THRASHER Computer Bulletin Board System (BBS) has been
     an information exchange for more than 1200 skaters since its
     start in 1985.  Those who have called might recognize the name
     Tom Jennings -- not only is he a regular caller, but the author
     of Fido -- the BBS program -- the standard in electronic BBS's.
     Since Tom's first crude Fido program in late 1983, his creation
     has spread across the entire U.S., most of Western Europe,
     Australia, and parts of Asia.  Each Fido board is linked into a
     gigantic network, FidoNet, which comes alive automatically every
     night at 1:00am.  Machines call each other and exchange informa-
     tion across the globe. If you're asking yourself what this means
     read on, as Tom sheds some light in an interview with the sysop
     of THRASHER BBS.

     THRASHER: EXPLAIN WHAT FIDO IS.

     TJ: Fido is a program which turns a personal computer into a BBS
     system.  A BBS is a computer connected to a telephone line thru
     a modem to form a kind of information base.  Other people with
     computers call BBS's and write messages to other callers, read
     messages from other callers, amd take programs and text files. A
     different community develops with every BBS and many times the
     conversations that take place thru the messages are quite good.
     A lot of boards are set up by techies for techies, but there are
     more and more underground, non-technical boards, like THRASHER.

         Anyone who uses Fido software to run a bulletin board can be
     part of a network called FidoNet.  FidoNet is a loose collection
     of BBS's with nothing in common but Fido software.

         FidoNet connects all the BBS's together, so the machines
     themselves exchange long distance connections and help keep
     phone costs down.  There are about 1500 'nodes' grouped together
     into different 'nets'.

         Up until about September most organizational work for Fido-
     Net was being done by a few people in one place.  This didn't
     really work, so we've recently gone to a system of total
     anarchy.  Implemented anarchy thru computers -- a real science
     fiction organization.  There's going to be no center, the work
     will be spread out over the country and generated simultaneously
     in 13 places.

         There are lots of ways to look at the new organization.  One
     is that it's taking a lot of decision making out of human hands
     and giving it to a machine.  But what's being taken amounts to
     grunt-work, making a fucking list.  This list has got to be 100%
     accurate, it's boring work -- no creativity involved.  Machines
     can do that shit.  It might sound de humanizing, but now instead
     Fidonews                     Page 25                  24 Nov 1986


     of having to do such boring work, people can go out and have
     fun.  That's what it's all about, that's what computers are
     about, not the opposite.

         Everyone thinks of computers as these big institutional
     things with narrow, specified applications.  People don't
     realize that computers are just another toy.  They're just
     another tool.  You can do anything you want with a handsaw, you
     can build all sorts of things, and a computer is just another
     tool.  So many people won't believe that, just don't understand.
     It's really obnoxious.  Kids at school now have BASIC examples
     in the columns of their textbooks, but computers are not about
     learning different computer languages.  Computers can help
     change the way you think about things and teach you to define
     new realities.  Like, what does this look like or do for the
     user, what does it look like to me the programmer?  Problem
     solving is what it is, learning to think about how to break
     problems down.

         All the concepts of computers -- loops, stacks, multitasking
     and interrupts -- those are human concepts.  They're narrow,
     rigid human concepts, which is why they can be put into machines
     like this.  Humans made those ideas up.  You're reading a book
     and somebody interrupts you...you put your finger where you were
     and you talk to them and you come back and start from there.
     That's exactly what the machine does.  And it does it because
     that's the way humans defined it, it's not the other way around.
     The techie guys are making it seem like it's some arbitrary,
     holy mathematical construct.  It's just another idea, and they
     never explain it like that.  No one uses those analogies because
     they don't sound technical.

     THRASHER: I'VE TALKED TO A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO AVOID COMPUTERS
     BECAUSE THEY THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BREAK THEM...

     TJ: That's typical, but the opposite is true.  I was at Malibu
     Grand Prix yesterday, where most reasonably good drivers can
     do between 55 and 60 seconds per lap.  There was a guy who kept
     doing 88 second laps -- turning it around the corners, not
     squealing the tires.  Then, all of a sudden his time jumped to
     60 seconds.  He got out and he said, "I just realized how it
     works, you don't just roll it around, you make the thing work."
     Skateboards are like that.  If you just roll along and turn by
     steering the trucks you'd never get anywhere, it would be boring
     very quickly.  You realize the only way to make it go is to beat
     the living shit out of it and make it work for a living.  Thrash
     it on the curb, flip it in the air and jump off ramps and land
     on your ass a whole lot, and you get better and better.  You
     realize there's a whole other level you go beyond.  Sometimes
     you find out by breaking it.  And even that applies to things
     like computers, or anything, because human techniques are human
     techniques and people learn how to do things.  That's what makes
     us human beings and not dogs.  A dog will figure out how to open
     a door and it won't usually figure out that it means you can
     open the other door this way, it will go thru the whole same
     process with another kind of door.  A little kid will figure it
     Fidonews                     Page 26                  24 Nov 1986


     out instantly and see a parallel, a door is a door.  And that's
     how humans solve problems, machines or no machines.  That is the
     level it works and people just don't see it because it's alwaus
     clouded in mystique and bullshit.

     THRASHER: WHERE DO YOU THINK COMPUTER FIT INTO, OR WILL FIT
     INTO, THE LIVES OF KIDS WHO READ THRASHER?

     TJ: I have an 18 year old friend who has an Apple with a printer
     and he uses it just like he uses his calculator.  He couldn't
     care less about it.  When he wants to write a paper for school
     he does it on his computer, just because it's easier to type
     there than on a typewriter or by hand, because he can go back
     and fix things.  It's not a big deal for him.  And that's
     probably a pretty typical attitude, not liking it but putting up
     with it.  It's just another tool, might as well know how to use
     it.  Actually, I was out skating in Golden Gate Park, trying to
     learn a few tricks, and these kids came by and gave me the most
     non-asshole advice I'd ever gotten in my life.  None of this
     put-down stuff, no expert-playing, a couple of kids came by, it
     was very humbling at first, I'm like twice their age...but any-
     way, we got to talking about computers and stuff.  They weren't
     particularly interested, they said they didn't see a connection
     between it.  I mean, why would anybody with a skateboard be
     interested in computers and viceversa.  I mentioned the THRASHER
     BBS, which one kid had heard of, so who knows.  I think now it's
     just another fun thing out there.  It might be fun and it might
     be boring.  It's just the computer nuts who want to have it
     different.

     THRASHER: NOT MANY PEOPLE START SKATING AT YOUR AGE [31], WHAT
     MADE YOU START?

     TJ: I think it was your fault.  You started sending me THRASHER.
     I started looking at it and sort of laughing.  And the more I
     looked at it the more it looked like fun, so I went out and
     bought myself a board.  If something is scary or a mystery it
     should be learned.  There are too many things that are just
     stupidly scary for no reason at all.  Just get rid of them. All
     of these things are being built by human beings, for human
     beings, so...if it's fun you should do it, if it's not any fun
     you shouldn't do it -- if you can possibly avoid it.

              NATIONAL VIETNAM VETERAN'S ECHO-MAIL CONFERENCE

                    There is one other wall, of course.
                          One we never speak of.
                             One we never see,
                 One which separates memory from madness.
                     In a place no one offers flowers.
                             THE WALL WITHIN.
                          We permit no visitors.
                                                 By Steve Mason

     I started out with Steve Mason's poem because it tells a story in
     itself. I believe it accurately describes in very few words one
     of the very many complex, and probably one of the most protected,
     commonalities shared not only among a vast majority of military
     combat veterans of ANY war, but among nearly every person who has
     witnessed and survived any kind of life-threatening traumatic
     experience as well.  This "wall" shields us from our darkest,
     most horrifying memories.  It is, without question, one of the
     most significant components manifested in Post-Traumatic Stress
     Syndrome (PTS).

     One of the toughest things for any combat veteran can be to open
     his or herself up (yes, there are women who have seen combat,
     too) to another human being and share the traumatic events from
     their past.  It is rare in this instance when the occasion can be
     found when both the will and and a sympathetic, non critical ear
     are both available at the same time.  Most of find it very hard,
     even when conditions are perfect, to "tell it like it really
     was".  One has to have an awful lot of trust in a person to risk
     the consequences of lowering "the wall" , much less to permit
     others to visit among our long-since buried memories and
     feelings.  When it gets right down to the line, most of us lose
     the courage to face the emotional ramifications which
     unmercifully enshroud us when we dare to share our deepest, most
     personal secrets with someone else. It is especially difficult
     when that other person has never experienced the same kind of
     traumatic events, making it difficult if not impossible  for them
     to truly understand our pain.

     How do you tell someone who has never experienced combat what it
     REALLY feels like to witness a comrades violent death?  What will
     that person think of you when you tell them what it REALLY feels
     like to have to take the life of another human being?  Is the
     emotional relief from getting it off your chest REALLY worth the
     gamble of possible rejection, ridicule, or criticism?  Well, I
     can tell you from my own experiences that is is far less painful
     to keep the "walls" in place than it is to face up to the
     terrifying realities they imprison.

     There are a few places where I can feel safe bringing up those
     old, painful memories; places where I can slowly pull each one
     out and deal with it in a comfortable atmosphere free of mis-
     understanding and criticism.  The local Vietnam Veterans Outreach
     Center is one, but I sometimes have problems in one-on-ones.  The
     others are computer bulletin boards where I can find others like
     myself who have been there and understand where I am coming from.

     I started a bulletin board just like that in my home in San Jose,
     California, now the Vietnam Veteran's Valhalla.  I also conceived
     of a national echo-mail conference devoted to the Vietnam Veteran
     and put out the call for supporters across the country.  That
     call was answered by three other Fido bulletin board sysops.
     Together, we have linked our systems between the east and west
     coasts and I am proud to boast of our success.  The other boards
     who have become a part of this conference are:

            The New York Transfer, 107/105, Bob Richards-sysop
                     718-442-1056 300/1200/2400 bauds

              The BNC Connector, 151/301, Bob Schreiber-sysop
                     704-262-1861 300/1200/2400 Bauds

               The Blowtorch, 109/606, Alexander Wall-sysop
                        202-686-9398 300/1200 Bauds

     There are people from all walks of life contributing to the
     National Vietnam Veterans Echo-Mail Conference; combat and non-
     combat veterans from all wars, non-veterans of all ages,
     Vietnamese military veterans and refugees.  Just because you are
     not a Vietnam Veteran, or even a military veteran at all for that
     matter, is no reason not to call one of the boards closest to
     you.  All you need is an interest in learning about the realities
     of the Vietnam war, and hearing about it from those of us who
     were actually there; who know the true cost of war and have paid that
     price.  No historian, unless he or she has been there personally,
     can tell you what WE can!

     We want to put out the call again and ask for the support of
     other Fido sysops around the country to become a part of this
     valuable public service by hosting and/or coordinating the Vietnam
     Veterans Echo-Mail Conference in your area.  Please contact me,
     Todd Looney, at the Vietnam Veteran's Valhalla in San Jose,
     California by FidoNet mail at node 143/27 to tell me you have
     decided to join us!  If you are on the east coast, please contact
     Bob Richards, the east coast coordinator, at the New York
     Transfer in Staten Island, New York 107/105.

     If you're a regular subscriber of the Fido Newsletter, this will
     be the third time you have read about this.  Why are you putting
     it off?  We need your support today!  We especially need your
     help if you are in one of the Mid-Western states (or anywhere
     between California and New York for that matter).  This type of
     public service is still quite a unique one to the world, and I
     think you will agree it is a service whose time has come and
     needs desperately to be addressed.  We can't really make it as

     successful as we would like without your help.

     Echo-Mail is one of the most effective means of mass-
     communications brought to light this century, let's USE it!

          Hello again......

          This  time  I  am  reviewing  a terminal program called BOYAN-C1.
     This  program  has quite a few unique features that will no doubt make
     it  a  LOT easier for one to operate when calling a bulletin board.  I
     have  only  had  this file for a few days and already I have noticed a
     distinct  drop  in my on-line time when calling long distance systems.
     This  in  itself  should be enough for most but the author has decided
     to  go  a  lot  farther  by  adding  such  features as a complete file
     handler  BUILT  IN the program itself.  You can do such mundane things
     as  copy,  move,  rename, or delete files with this feature but I find
     the  best use is one I think not one person has thought of before...to
     wit  marking  the  files  for either uploading or downloading.  He has
     also  included  a  feature  that makes X-modem protocol file transfers
     almost  as  easy to do as the Tele-Link file transfer is now.  This is
     the  ability  of the terminal package to remember the filename you are
     downloading  from  a bulletin board when you type it in, thus when you
     have  entered  the  information  for downloading on the system all you
     need  do is hit the PgDn and the term program will insert the filename
     for you on your disk.

          This  program  has no limit to the amount of buffer since it uses
     the  disk  itself  for storing info automatically.  It also can handle
     editing  a  file  of any size due to the same reason, it uses the disk
     as a buffer !

          The  many features of this program are too varied and good for me
     to  fully  describe  here,  but I will say that the author has shown a
     great  deal  of imagination in writing this one and I for one think it
     is well worth the requested SHAREWARE donation.

          The  file in ARC format is about 144k long but when you un-ARC it
     you  should do it to either a hard drive or an EMPTY floppy as it is a
     real hog for space.

                        Disk I/O Slowing you down?

     Are you dealing with a large Database that takes forever to read?

           Is your Network bogged down due to disk seek time?

      Do you simply want to make better use of the Extended/Expanded
                     memory capacity on your system?


                           Your solution is:

                       D I S C A C H E    V 0.01


     DISCACHE can help you recover lost seconds when it counts.

     DISCACHE works by keeping commonly accessed disk data in memory
     so that when such data is read it is copied from memory rather
     than read from disk.

     DISCACHE  supports 3-types of memory:

                       Conventional (to 640K)
                       Extended - AT memory via BIOS INT 15
                       Expanded - via Lotus/Intel EMS

     DISCACHE  can help you utilize ALL of your Extended/Expanded
     memory to the fullest, as it helps you get the most from your
     system.

     DISCACHE  is available to you through the FidoNet News, not at
     the full price ($75.00), but for only: $49.00  (aren't you glad
     you read the FidoNews?).

     DISCACHE  can be obtained by sending your check or money order
     (NO CASH PLEASE) and a description of your equipment type (i.e.
     System and Hard Disk/controller card, etc.) to:  W.E.G. Systems,
     P.O. Box 5072, Springfield, VA 22150.  Or contact us via FidoMail
     for information, on the WAFRUG_BBS 109/626 at (703)-425-0695.

     (DISCACHE  supports only those hard disks that are accessible via
     standard BIOS interface!)

         Full Disclosure announces a special subscription drive for
     new subscribers.  Full Disclosure is offering for a limited time
     only, absolutely FREE three issue subscriptions.  This offer
     applies to new subscribers only.  All you have to do is reply to
     this offer now.  Full Disclosure is normally $15/yr (12 issues).

         Full Disclosure is a hard hitting newspaper that doesn't use
     government press releases for its stories.  We use information
     obtained from private sources that don't have a vested interest
     in promoting big government, and from extensive use of the
     Freedom of Information Act.  Summaries of world news from
     numerous foreign publications are also included in each issue.
     Since 1984, we've reported on citizens rights, government
     corruption, secrecy, and other topics of interest.

         And our stories bring results.  Full Disclosure's interview
     with retired CIA agent Victor Marchetti had such a big impact
     that it was included in a course on intelligence at Yale
     University, an Ivy League school and one of America's most
     prestigious institutions of higher learning. That's the kind of
     coverage that led Sound Choice to remark:

         ``This is a type of publication that is especially needed.
     Full Disclosure publishes research on government agencies'
     illegal and immoral (often highly secret) actions against its
     citizens and environment... Don't think such things aren't
     happening -- they are.  Don't get scared -- get aware.''

         Hurry and send your name and address along with a request
     for a special three issue free subscription to: Full Disclosure,
     Box 8275-FI2, Ann Arbor, MI 48107.  Or reply to Fido 120/31.
