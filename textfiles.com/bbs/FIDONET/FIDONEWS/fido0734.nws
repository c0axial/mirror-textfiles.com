                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================


     A funny thing happened this summer.  FidoNews changed its default
     archiver.  It  broke  a  few  batch files.  And FidoNet survived!
     Thank God for those little miracles.

     This has been a fascinating story.  Certainly the best one I know
     of that concerns FidoNews itself.    But  it's  starting  to  get
     boring now, and I'm going to have to bring it to a close.

     I have heard the words "insolent" and "arrogant" used to describe
     our actions.  I'm not really sure  where  the insolence comes in.
     I'll have to wait until somebody explains that  to  me.    As for
     arrogance  -- if you're a software author in FidoNet  and  you're
     not  arrogant  yet, just wait a week or so, it's  a  communicable
     disease  here.   I've seen no cure as yet either, except  perhaps
     for complete removal of the cause.  So I'm arrogant.  So sorry.

     That  doesn't  mean that I don't care about FidoNet at large.   I
     do.  Enough to be keeping my eyes open for potential problems and
     to take  action  when  it  appears  warranted.  I saw a potential
     problem.  It  appeared  to require action.  I took action.  Harry
     took the heat.  His call.  I was willing to.  I do now.

     There have been several  objections  to the change.  Most of them
     were  not objections to the  dropping  of  ARC.    Most  actually
     protested the use of LHArc rather  than  ZIP.    We'll cover that
     issue later in this editorial.  The  complaints  which  I want to
     address first are from those who felt we  had  acted unreasonably
     in making the change without advance notice.

     Did your batch file break?  I apologize.  Should I have given you
     some warning so you could fix it beforehand?  Maybe.   Would this
     advance  notice  have  been  interpreted  as  license  to start a
     NET_DEV-style filibuster?  I think so.

     I'm a  great  fan  of  Grace Hopper, whose favorite admonition is
     that it's often  (I  think she says "always" rather then "often",
     actually) easier to apologize  than to ask permission.  With that
     in mind, we decided to  avoid  the  filibuster  by presenting you
     with a fait accompli.

     However, before FidoNews went out in a .LZH file, I consulted the
     International Coordinator, the Zone 1 Coordinator, and the holder
     of the Trademark.  Nobody cautioned me not to do it.  Nobody told
     me not to do it.    I had either an implicit or explicit go-ahead
     from each (though TJ made a point of not wanting to "meddle", one
     way or the other).  Nobody felt  that  the world would come to an
     end if I made the change.  Nobody felt that Dan Quayle would wind
     up as the U.S.  President as a consequence of the lack of advance
     notice.  End of story.  We did it.

     FidoNews 7-34                Page 2                   20 Aug 1990


     That's why there was no advance notice.  I still feel that it was
     the only way  to make this change.  To those of you who are still
     offended that I didn't appear at your doorstep, prostrate myself,
     and ask for your divine  consent  --  I'm  sorry.  But you're the
     kind of person Grace had in  mind,  and  I'll  not be asking your
     permission the next time I have an idea either.

     Let's get down the the "ARC versus  the  world"  issue now.  When
     you really get down to cases, it's the only part that matters.

     This has nothing to do with the SEA  vs.  PKware lawsuit.  I made
     this  decision  before  reading  the  materials  that seem to  be
     floating around the net -- in fact, I haven't read  them  yet for
     this very reason.

     ARC 5.12 was a standard that is still very widespread.   But  SEA
     is breaking  this standard themselves in their new product, which
     works best in  its  (DEFAULT!)  incompatibility  modes.   This is
     nothing new for ARC.  It's part of ARC's evolutionary history.  I
     know that many of you  are  familiar  with  the message "Sorry, I
     can't unpack this archive.  You need a newer version of ARC."

     This inconvenience was offset by the  improvements  offered,  and
     for those people who were using ARC  on  other  platforms  -- new
     source code to port.

     ARC 6.0 changed all that.  For apparently  obvious  reasons,  the
     widespread  distribution  of  source  code  ended.   As the  gain
     involved  in  moving  to 6.0 was small and the public  was  still
     angry over the Katz lawsuit (whether they were right or wrong  in
     this regard, the fact remains that they were ANGRY), not too many
     people in  FidoNet  actually  used  it  --  and those people were
     generally savvy enough to keep 6.0 archives off the public net.

     ARC 7.0 is  a better product than 6.0.  In fact, MUCH better.  It
     will sell, in my  opinion.    To  neophytes, in many cases.  This
     makes the .ARC extension a  shaky  one  for  people who are still
     running ports of 5.12.

     Why?  Consider those users who  have no archiving software.  They
     download FNEWSxxx.ARC.  Then they download XARC  or  whatever  to
     unarc  it.   In the process of registering  their  shareware  ARC
     software  or  using  XARC  etc,  they  are  very likely  to  find
     themselves  on  the  business end of a sales pitch for  ARC  7.0.
     Many people confronted with this pitch are likely to buy -- hell,
     why  not?   Then they archive something up.  Then they upload it.
     Then if  you're  not  running DOS or OS/2 you will not be able to
     access the contents  of  that  archive,  since there is no source
     available for any dearchiver  and  SEA  is only releasing DOS and
     OS/2 software.  That's intolerable.

     FidoNews 7-34                Page 3                   20 Aug 1990


     I hope the people at  SEA  do well.  They are hard-working people
     and they deserve to benefit from the fruits of their labors.  But
     I  don't  want to be in a  position  to  help  confuse  the  .ARC
     standard,  which  in my opinion is now locked  at  5.12,  through
     indirect marketing of ARC 7.0.  I also do  not  want  to  somehow
     become victimized by it through receipt of ARC 7.0 archives  that
     I can't unpack.  So I won't distribute .ARC files.

     Most people think that if I don't use ARC, I should  use  ZIP.  I
     think  not.    I know that there is code about for unzippers  and
     that archive  formats  are  documented.  But ZIP could wind up on
     the same path  as  ARC, and since there are other archivers which
     are not being developed  or  distributed  with commercial gain in
     mind, I'd rather pass on ZIP.

     Zoo  is  another  standard.   It's  not  too  bad,  in  terms  of
     compression.  It's about on a  par  with  ARC 5.12, in fact.  But
     these days that's not too good.   Rumors  abound that Rahul Dhesi
     is  adding  better  compression  methods  to it, but  as  yet  --
     nothing.  That's the only bad thing I can  say  about  it.    Its
     structures  are  well  thought out, in terms of portability.   In
     fact, its portability is outstanding.

     LHArc is Freely Available with source in both Intel assembler and
     ANSI  C.   No marketing pitch, no fancy sales talk, always up  to
     date  on  all platforms.  And it's about as good as anything else
     (and MUCH better than ARC 5.12!).  It's slower than most, but the
     bottom line is connect time.  Smaller archives cost less to move.

     I chose LHArc  because it was unencumbered with commercial intent
     or pretense (as is  also  the  case  with  Zoo),  and  because it
     compresses much better.  I intend to stay with it.  There will be
     no change in archive format for  the  forseeable  future.   We've
     made our change and we're going to stick with it.

     I might  add  that  for those of you who are getting FidoNews via
     file request from 1:1/1, you can request FIDONEWS to get the .LZH
     file and FIDOTEXT to  get  the  uncompressed  .NWS file.  I don't
     know of anyone who can  do  file  requests but can't uncompress a
     .LZH file, but you never know.

     Thanks for listening.  This thread is  now  ended.   Let's try to
     get conversation regarding FidoNews back to what's in  it and not
     what it's in.

     Cheers,
     Vince

     =================================================================
                                 ARTICLES
     =================================================================

     John Passaniti
     Fidonet 1:260/201

     I am one-half of the Fidonet hub for Rochester, New York
     (260/2xx).  Part of the thrill of being in Fidonet is wondering
     what other people are going to do, and how it will affect you.
     The recent Fidonews fiasco is a beautiful case in point.

     A well-meaning individual decided to make a change for the
     better, and used LHARC to compress Fidonews.  That well-meaning
     individual probably didn't consider the number of people in the
     network who _expect_ or _need_ to have Fidonews be compressed as
     something resembling an ARC file.  (Reminder: please write a
     "registered trademark" symbol after "ARC" in the preceding
     sentence on any printouts of this issue of Fidonews.)

     I really wouldn't have minded so much if I would have been given
     warning.  As it turns out, we have a node in our hub which cannot
     decompress LHARC files-- he is running on a Tandy Color Computer,
     and nobody has ported LHARC for his machine.  This means I have
     to spend time and effort in decompressing and recompressing the
     Fidonews for him.  Should I have to?

     But enough of my bitching-- anyone can complain.  I have a
     solution that with enough people's help can eliminate this sort
     of problem.


     THE PROBLEM:

     To some people, compression programs aren't a practical matter of
     concern-- they are a religious issue.  There is an awful lot of
     "emotional liability" involved with some compression programs.

     Some people refuse to use ARC (again, don't forget the
     "registered trademark" symbol) because of the court case between
     SEA and PKware.  Some people refuse to use PKZIP for the same
     reason.  Both kinds of people probably don't have enough depth to
     understand what the court case was really about, and waste the
     time of the rest of us with their nonsense.

     If recent comments in Fidonews are to be believed, some people
     object to the use of LHARC because it is was written by a
     Japanese person.  Wow-- futile nationalism comes to software!

     I'm sure there are others who have strong objections to using
     programs like ZOO, and whatever other compression programs I
     haven't mentioned.

     FidoNews 7-34                Page 5                   20 Aug 1990


     Others may have more valid (non-religious) reasons for objecting
     to certain compression programs.  Some programs may not be ported
     to their machine.  Some programs might go outside the bounds of
     what a particular machine can do (such as amount of memory
     needed, or disk I/O limitations).


     THE SOLUTION:

     What is needed is a _true_ Fidonet compression standard.  This
     standard should be 100% public domain, and be written in as
     portable a manner as possible to promote it to be ported to as
     many machines as possible.

     ARC, PKZIP, LHARC, ZOO, and whatever others are out there fail in
     various respects.  The source code for ARC isn't portable without
     tedious work, and it certainly isn't public domain.  PKZIP offers
     no source code.  LHARC offers source code, but it isn't as
     portable as some would lead you to believe.  And ZOO-- well, ZOO
     is about the best candidate of the bunch, but I'm sure someone,
     somewhere out there has some objection to it-- valid or not.

     This new Fidonet compression standard would be used for the
     weekly Fidonews and "nodediff."  It would also replace ARC as the
     _base_ standard for echomail compression.  Note that this doesn't
     prevent two consenting adults from using any echomail compression
     program they want on the privacy of their own system.

     Note that the purpose of this compression standard wouldn't be to
     compete with other compression programs.  The authors who write
     those programs have interests other than Fidonet in mind.  This
     new compression standard would be both BY Fidonet members, and
     FOR Fidonet members.


     MAKING THE SOLUTION A REALITY:

     Software doesn't appear out of thin air, and while my mythical
     compression standard doesn't yet exist, nothing is preventing a
     few programmers who are interested in such a project from getting
     together and making it a reality.

     Such a group would include programmers who were familiar with
     portability issues; who could work both independently and
     together with others; and who could port the compression standard
     to as many machines as possible.

     Every single machine that now can participate in Fidonet would
     NEED this compression standard ported to it, or it would be
     useless as a standard.

     FidoNews 7-34                Page 6                   20 Aug 1990


     To start this project, I offer an echo conference to anyone who
     would like to participate in it.  The conference will be
     unmoderated, and available initially from Fidonet 1:260/228.  If
     you are interested, please send mail to me at 1:260/228, and I'll
     set you up so you can poll for it.


     CLOSING WORDS:

     Virtually every technical specification needed to participate in
     Fidonet is available-- from either the Fidonet Technical
     Standards Committee documents which are available, or from the
     wealth of source code that many authors have contributed.

     The only technical specification that isn't similarly documented
     is a compression standard.  This is a glaring oversight that
     needs to be corrected as soon as possible.

     Fidonet has grown far beyond anyone's imagination, and continues
     to grow.  The lack of a technical specification for a compression
     standard is something that must be addressed.  With your help, we
     can create such a standard, and promote the spread of Fidonet.

                   LHARC, The Snooze, IFNA, and Iraq
                   ---------------------------------
                           By Kwityer Bychin


     Well folks, here I am once again to agitate and  irritate  the
     masses. Being that the  masses  are  so  easily  agitated  and
     irritated.

     We'll start this week's column with a little  talk  about  the
     most  recent  Earth-shaking,  life  threatening,  disaster  to
     strike Fidonet; Vince  &  Harry's  switch  to  LHArc  FOR  THE
     SNOOZE!! (Dun Dun DUNNNN!)....

     Oh boy this REALLY IS A BIG  DEAL  now,  ain't  it  folks?!  I
     mean, the entire membership of Fidonet literally SCRAMBLES  to
     read the Snooze every week now don't we? I mean, it plays such
     a major part in our lives, that any attempt to  change  it  is
     sacreligious!

     Now,  let's  take  a  look  at  this  thing  like  the  mature
     well-adjusted adults that we are shall we? <whew!>

     Here we have Vince Perriello,  a  NICE  GUY.  He  is,  really.
     I've met him. He spent 4 days at Conclave '90  doing  this  'n
     that, but not ONCE did he engage in ANY sort of  devil-worship
     whatsoever. Nope. No horns, no tail, just a couple bottles  of
     BINK BEER and a copy of  Fight-O-News,  cruising  through  the
     conference.

     Meanwhile,  back  at  the  ranch,  all  kinds  of  people  are
     foaming at the mouth  because  Commandant  Perriello  had  the
     audacity to change COMPRESSION METHODS for the Snooze. And  to
     our absolute HORROR, he didn't even ask PERMISSION. Woooo. Bad
     dude, that Perriello.

     Vince whips out his copy  of  LHarc,  compresses  the  Snooze,
     ships it off, and all kinds of PEOPLE start whining  WAAAAAAH!
     WAAAAAH! YOU BROKE MY BATCH FILE!!  WAAAAAH!!  As  if  NOTHING
     ever went awry with their systems.

     You say can't decompress the LHarc archive?  Well  guess  what
     Virigina? The source code is available! MAKE IT WORK  ON  YOUR
     SYSTEM. What? You say you don't WANT to port  the  code  over?
     Y9ou don't know HOW? You want someone to  make  a  version  FOR
     YOU? OHHHH!! Right Away!

     Hey, this is a HOBBY, this ain't LIFE & DEATH  here.  If  your
     batch file's broke, FIX IT.

     OH WAIT!! There's a GIF PICTURE in  Snooze  #733!  Oh  my  GOD
     this is terrible! We can hear the bawling already!  WAAAAAHH!!
     The archive is too  big  now!!  WAAAAAH!!  TWO  FILES  in  the
     archive broke my new batch file that I just fixed!!  WAAAAAH!!
     I WANT AN RLE PICTURE!!!  WAAAAH!!  I  CAN'T  VIEW  IT  ON  MY

     And as far as IRAQ is concerned, we could  end  that  conflict
     over there by giving Hussein a node number and sending him and
     his buddies the SYSOP echo.  And  maybe  a  copy  of  the  NEW
     IMPROVED FIDONEWS!  Then  they  could  spend  all  their  time
     FLAMING AND KILLING EACH OTHER, just like WE DO!

     Wow. Chemical weapons in the SYSOP conference....

     Now I'm supposed to talk  about  IFNA.  Remember  IFNA?  NO???
     Where have you BEEN for the last week or so? Well,  for  those
     of you that know what IFNA was, IT'S DEAD. Yep. The membership
     and the BoD voted it into oblivion on August 4, 1990.  TRASHED
     it. And You know what? Since  the  thing  kicked  the  bucket,
     traffic in the IFNA echo skyrocketed! Pretty good huh?

     Speaking of the IFNA echo,  you  GOTTA  check  this  one  out.
     Read the stuff in there by this guy named FRED.  He  wants  to
     BAN BETA TESTING OF MAILERS. He wants to make an FTSC  with  a
     minimum AGE requirement of 25. He wants to  do  all  kinds  of
     INTERESTING STUFF.

     If you're too young to remember Joe  McCarthy,  HERE  IS  YOUR
     BIG CHANCE.

     Hey kids! You're old enough to  drive,  old  enough  to  vote,
     old enough to DIE FOR AMERICA IN SAUDI ARABIA, but  FRED  SAYS
     you AIN'T OLD ENOUGH to evaulate BINKLEYTERM!

     Hey, let's hear it for  Fred  huh!  <clap  clap  clap>  A  big
     hand, come on!

     Oh and before I go, how about that  BOB  MORAVSIK  eh??  <clap
     clap clap> Let's give him a big hand! How can I  possibly  end
     such a  violent  column  without  taking  a  couple  shots  at
     MAHATMA-RAVSIK??!! Didja  read  last  week's  SNOOZE  ??  (Oh,
     that's right I forgot. You can't decompress it). Well  anyway,
     an article in last week's Snooze says MAHATMA-RAVSIK was named
     IC! PRETTY FUNNY STUFF  EH?  I'll  bet  that  if  that  really
     happened, he'd  file  a  complaint  against  himself,  and  be
     EGGS-COMMUNICATED. Oooooh. BAD EGG that Moravsik.

     Well folks, that's enough drivel  for  this  issue.  Now  WHIP
     OUT those word processors while your blood pressure  is  still
     200 over 150 and SEND IN THAT HATE MAIL! Let's  see  just  how
     good a job LHarc REALLY DOES!

                    TechCon-I, the Report (part 1)


     OK, so here it is folks: the first part of the TechCon-I
     report. "What is a TechCon?", I hear you ask?

     TechCon-I was the first 2-day conference which was entirely
     devoted to FidoNet Technology. It was held at the same time and
     in the same hotel as EuroCon-IV: on July 14th and 15th in
     Antwerp, Belgium.

     Anyway, if this is the first you hear of TechCon, you haven't
     been reading FidoNews regularly, because it was announced well
     in advance, and already commented upon by FidoNews' editor,
     Vince Perriello.

     Vince wasn't at TechCon simply as the FidoNews Editor (in fact,
     that's not why he was there at all). He'd also brought Bob
     Hartman and the new BinkleyTerm with him. Moreover, Rick Moore
     had appointed him as the official FTSC representative at
     TechCon.

     Obviously, there were a lot of other interesting people among
     the attendants (me, for one ;-). I'm not going to name any,
     because I'd have to list all of the attendants in order not to
     forget anyone interesting.

     Anyway, here we go...


     BinkleyTerm 2.40 Release - Bob Hartman and Vince Perriello
     ----------------------------------------------------------

     It had been quite a while since the Trio released BinkleyTerm
     2.30 (September 5th, 1989), so something was to be expected.
     We were nevertheless semi-surprised and delighted that Bob
     and Vince came to Europe to give their first public
     presentation on BinkleyTerm 2.40 at TechCon.

     The features:
     - Most of the messages BinkleyTerm displays and puts in its
     log are now configurable, in order to accomodate non-English-
     speaking users. This will probably break every log analyser
     in existence, but what the heck :-). The messages are
     contained in a separate file (BINKLEY.LNG) which can be
     generated by a language file compiler. The structure of this
     file is published (by means of the Binkley source code), so
     log file analysers should make use of this structure, and
     compare the messages they find in the log to the ones they
     find in the .LNG-file.
     - Janus, the long-awaited full duplex file transfer protocol,
     has finally been added on an experimental basis. It is
     important for users to understand that it might break. (As it
     FidoNews 7-34                Page 10                  20 Aug 1990


     happens: evidence that there was indeed a problem had been
     popping up earlier that day. During the rest of their stay,
     Bob and Vince worked with their local beta team to start
     solving this and other problems, JC). Janus is rather
     counterproductive on HST connections, because of the long
     line turn-around times. It does work very well in V32
     situations though.
     - A state engine has been implemented, providing a relatively
     simple way to implement new protocols should the need arise.
     This has also helped in assuring compatibility with FTS-0007
     and FTS-0008, much to the delight of SEAdog users.
     - BinkleyTerm now supports 5D-addressing, that is: zone, net,
     node, point and domain. This includes support of FSC-0045 and
     FSC-0049. The nodelists for each of the domains are separate:
     they no longer have to be compiled into a set of huge files.
     A drawback is that no packer easily supports this new feature
     as yet. It can be done with some intricate batch file
     programming though.
     - The first pop-up windows have been added to Bink: Alt-G
     (interactively generates a file request), Alt-S (a file
     attach) and Alt-K (removes all mail for the named node from
     the outbound). This required another extension of the Colors-
     statement in the config file.
     - BinkleyTerm can now exit with a configurable exit code upon
     receipt of one or more files with a certain extension (say,
     .TIC). Comes in handy for SDS nodes.
     - Support for yet another multitasker was added: PC-MOS.
     Also, if no multitasker is detected nor declared, Binkley
     will call the DOS idle interrupt (0x28) whenever it would
     have called the multitasker's time slice release routine, had
     a multitasker been installed. This tremendously speeds up
     background tasks under DOS, such as the $25 Network.
     - Another long-awaited feature is MaxBytes: a limitation of
     the number of bytes a certain class of nodes is allowed to
     request during one session. Insufficient time was left before
     TechCon started for Vince to implement a limitation based on
     time (or baud rate, if you like) as well. This will be
     incorporated in a future release.
     - In order to avoid the dead-time between the CONNECT message
     from the modem and the start of the session, an MNP and V42
     Modem Protocol Negotiation Filter has been implemented. The
     3-second delay was required for the classic case where a non-
     MNP modem was called by an MNP modem. The MNP handshake had
     to be skipped, since it could contain an ESC, which would
     obviously cause Binkley to drop to the BBS. It is now
     filtered instead.
     - A Terminal-mode initstring was added.
     - Curmudgeon mode will no longer throw out new nodes who use
     the net/-1 or net/9999 convention, so as to allow NCs who
     like Curmudgeon mode to take calls from nodes in spe.
     - In order to support multi tasking even better, semaphore
     files are being placed in the outbound areas during sessions.
     Other tasks can look for these files (.BSY extension) and not
     do anything that might interfere with the ongoing session.
     Binkley will refuse to send files to a node if it detects
     that that same node is engaged in a session with a Binkley in
     FidoNews 7-34                Page 11                  20 Aug 1990


     another task (or on another workstation of the LAN).
     - The screen can now be unblanked during a session. The
     unblanking functionality can now also be selected: should the
     screen unblank when a key is pressed, or whenever something
     happens?
     - BinkleyTerm is definitely dolphin-safe. No Bink has ever
     killed a dolphin. (This is an undocumented feature, JC).

     Question time.

     (The following questions and answers reflect my
     interpretation of the discussion, JC).

     Q: Could you please implement a file request limit based on
     time as well?
     A: Yes, we're working on it. It could have been in this
     release, but we ran out of time.

     Q: Why does an .RSP-file need to be a file. Couldn't you send
     a packet like D'Bridge ?
     A: You can't always send a packet and expect the other side
     to know that you've sent mail. Not all protocols support
     sending more than 1 packet per session in each direction.

     Q: Can a BinkleyTerm user put a file on hold for a point that
     is not his own without knowing the point's private net?
     A: No. The reason why BinkleyTerm isn't fully 4D is that this
     poses a problem with Opus 1.03. Wynn defined a 4D structure
     in the hello-packet, but subsequently didn't use it himself.
     Therefore, if we were to implement this (Bink hasn't changed
     in this respect since 2.00), a point using BinkleyTerm would
     pick up the mail destined for his boss. This was not
     acceptable, because of the large number of nodes (a few
     thousand) that were using barefoot Opera, and the release of
     Opus 1.10 was far from imminent. Now that this problem has
     been addressed in Opus 1.10, the importance of this argument
     has obviously diminished, but we still don't think that the
     number of nodes that would have to change over overnight is
     sufficiently small yet. But we will address this problem in
     the near future ("It'll probably be in the next release").

     Q: What do you think about EMSI?
     A: The way we see it, EMSI should address 3 problems: we'd
     like to see a novel way to update the nodelist, it would be
     nice if two nodes could exchange all the mail for their
     respective AKAs during a single session, and we'd like to be
     able to talk to mainframes, that have front-end processors
     requiring CRs between input records, as well as 7-bit data.
     The first two are indeed addressed by EMSI as of now, but we
     feel that the third-one is much more important, in view of
     the fact that large companies have offered us (FidoNet) their
     excess capacity for free. We're sure Chris and JoHo will work
     with us towards a solution to this problem.

     Message Digest -- Henk Wevers
     -----------------------------

     Henk is a professional crypto-analyst. He talked about the
     MD4 method of message authentication, which was devised by an
     American corporation with the cooperation of M.I.T.

     The algorythm creates a 128-bit (16-byte) fingerprint which
     would take 2^128 computations to fake. Due to its simplicity,
     MD4 is very fast. Henk provided sample source code in Pascal
     and C (the files MD4PAS.ARC and MD4C.ARC are available from
     2:295/27). He urges everyone to take a look at this, and to
     propose a way to utilise it in FidoNet.

     Before this, or any other method of authentication, can be
     used, we need to define exactly what the 'message text' is.
     Kludge lines are certainly not a part of the message text in
     this respect: they should be skipped when calculating the
     message digest, because they can change as the message
     progresses through the network. The problem is that there
     isn't really a definition of what a kludge line really is.
     Henk has been talking to Randy Bush about this, specifically
     about the definition of a 'physical line'. This must be
     solved first.


     Edifact -- Henk Wevers
     ----------------------

     The type 2 packet, as it is currently in use, has proven to
     be problematic, in that many of its uses are too loosely
     defined, and that too little flexibility is allowed for. We
     therefore need a solid standard on message structure, for
     which there are two well-known contenders: X.400 and Edifact.
     The X.400 standard is very difficult to implement, so let's
     concentrate on Edifact.

     Edifact is an entirely text-based (not necessarily ASCII)
     message standard, which is very simple to implement. (As a
     matter of fact, the commercial version of Dutchie already
     supports Edifact.) The standard comprises specifications on
     the message format and on the bundling of those messages.

     The bundling part of the standard is very straightforward:
     messages are simply concatenated in a file to form a bundle.
     As for the message format: a group of people planning to
     exchange Edifact messages is free to define its own message
     building blocks, in addition to those that are predefined in
     the standard. The FTSC could be the body that maintains a
     list of building blocks for use in FidoNet: a database of
     centrally allocated building block definitions.

     FidoNews 7-34                Page 13                  20 Aug 1990


     The character set in use in most Edifact implementations to
     date is 7-bit ASCII, because of the wide range of platforms
     the messages need to be processed on. The standard is already
     in common use in the transportation, the medical and the
     banking sectors.

     Edifact allows for the easy implementation of forms: a
     company could send its customers an Edifact message
     containing a form for them to fill out, to order certain
     goods, for example. Likewise, an NC could send such a message
     to an applicant for a node number. Form fields can be
     mandatory or optional, conditional, repetitive, etc. This
     implies that a message editor for Edifact looks more like a
     form processor than like a 'conventional' message editor.

     This standard is not difficult to implement, and it'll gain
     us a lot of credibility in the world at large.

     For more info on Edifact, please ask Henk Wevers in netmail
     how to order a copy of the standard.


     Echomail -- Vince Perriello
     ---------------------------

     A brain storming among a few attendants during the coffee
     break caused Vince to bring a subject up that had previously
     been discussed by a subcommittee of the FTSC: a way to
     distribute conferences without having to insert PATH and
     SEEN-BY information (or its equivalent).

     Vince's version of this concept was based on the idea that
     each node has a maximum of one uplink for a certain area, and
     that a bit in the message header (like the file request bit,
     which isn't used in echomail anyway) would specify whether a
     message is on its way up in the topology, or on its way down.

     After a number of questions from the audience, this mechanism
     was proven not to be immune against dupes, and it was agreed
     that any type of conference distribution system without PATH
     or SEEN-BY information should be.

     Bob pointed out that GroupMail actually does all the things
     we want, and that it's a mystery why the GroupMail standard
     hasn't been used more widely. The standard is published, and
     there is no reason why groupmail processors could not be
     written that support different compression programs than Arc.



     OK, so that's the first part. The rest of it will appear in the
     next issue, or so I hope...

     =================================================================


     Christopher Baker
     MetroFire, 1:135/14, Miami_FL_USA

              This Time it's More than a Phone Number!

     MetroFire is changing numbers AND locations this time. As
     of Nodelist.229 on 17 Aug 90, MetroFire will cease to be
     1:135/14 and will become 1:374/14 in Titusville_FL_USA.

     135/14 will continue to be listed in Net 135 for a couple
     weeks while I make the transition to my new locale and get
     the requisite dedicated line. It will appear as a Hold Node
     in both Nets 135 and 374 during the changeover.

     Those of you who have active links to MetroFire are advised
     to note this change and to change any passwords or links to
     1:374/14 from 1:135/14 after you've compiled Nodelist.229.

     Those linked to Echos that I originate [FHCOOK and
     MENSANS_ONLY] will continue to get those Echos sent to you
     directly. You will not be able to poll the new listing for
     a couple weeks, at least.

     This move is sudden and a direct result of a Workmans
     Compensation case I've been embroiled in for some time. I
     have received a judgement in my favor but it still has not
     been paid and I can no longer afford to live in Miami while
     my former employer attempts to reverse it on appeal.

     I apologize to anyone who is being inconvenienced by this
     change. I am not leaving FidoNet or BBSing but I must move
     to Titusville [and was going to anyway when the case was
     settled] where my family resides before the sheriff throws
     me out [I haven't been paid since 29 Mar 90]. [grin]

     Mail sent to either Node number will eventually make it to
     me but I suggest you start using 1:374/14 as soon as you
     compile Nodelist.229.

     My thanks to Net 135 for their generosity and cooperation
     and Hello to Net 374! Here comes trouble. [snicker]
