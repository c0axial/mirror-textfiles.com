                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================


     There is a notice in this Issue about ISDN flag changes in the Zone 1
     Nodelist segment. It's one of our functions here.

     There is NO notice of the apparently impending ZC1 election. There is
     NO notice of the apparently active IC election. That is to say, there
     is no official notice of either. What's up with that?

     For a Network founded on and dedicated to communication, there seems
     to be precious little communicating going on from FidoNet's upper
     Coordinator cadre. Why is that?

     We all know how long it takes to write a Netmail message. It takes
     scarcely longer to edit and submit a FidoNews article [.ART] or
     notice [.NOT]. The only thing required is the will to do so. Where
     is it?

     Think of these as the Questions of the Week but not in the QOTW
     section [making this a shorter Issue {grin}]. It would be swell to
     have some Answers of the Week for FidoNews 1409. When will that
     happen?

     Don't forget the FIDONEWS Echo and the FidoNet WebRing!

     Subj :
     IC-election


     Dear RC,

     The IC-election has now finally started.

     There are 2 candidates :

        * ZC/2 Ward Dossche
        * ZC/5 Henk Wolsink

     They were nominated by :

        * ZC/2 by ZC/3 and ZC/6
        * ZC/5 by ZC/1

     Votes cast so far:

        * ZC/2 by Zone-3 / Total=1
        * ZC/5 by Zone-1 / Total=1

     Zone-4 and -6 have expressed to support ZC/2 and probably will vote
     that way.

     As it is safe to assume ZC/5 will vote for himself this leaves the
     vote of Zone-2 unaccounted for.

     My question therefor to you is to provide guidance in this election.

     If I'm guided to vote in zone-2's name for ZC/2 then it concludes the
     election and there is an IC.

     If I'm guided to vote in zone-2's name for ZC/5 then the election most
     likely will be a draw after a 20-month process.

     The deadline for me to cast my vote is February 28th, that leaves 10
     days at this moment. That's not a great deal of time and it
     unfortunately coincides with the ZC-election but I'd appreciate anyway
     you taking some time and providing me with the guidance I request.

     Thank you very much for your effort.

         Information:

             The purpose of this FSC is to focus discussion on particular
             problems in Fidonet(r) and possible methods of solution.  No
             proposed solutions in this document are intended as
             standards for Fidonet.  Rather, it is hoped that a general
             consensus will emerge as to the appropriate solution to such
             problems, leading eventually to the adoption of standards.
             Distribution is subject to the limitations listed below.

     Modem Handling
     --------------

     The current nodelist doesn't provide enought information for really
     fancy handling of modems and connections.  With the advent of line
     sharing between modems/faxes certain additions to the nodelist flags
     are required.

     I am currently writing a product which will handle and use the
     following codes

     Y.... where .... can consist of the hardware protocols the modem
     understands
         A   300 V.21          > Usually one of these flags would be
     present to
         B   300 Bell 103      > designate the chosen 300 baud hardware
     protocol

     different modem standards etc.

     Status of this document:

          This FSC presents the final draft of a proposed FTSC (FidoNet(r)
          Technical Standards Committee) standard for the FidoNet community
          and requests comments from all interested parties.  Distribution
          of this document is unlimited.

     MSGID

          A MSGID line consists of the string "^AMSGID:" (where ^A is a
          control-A (hex 01) and the double-quotes are not part of the
          string),  followed by a space,  the address of the originating
          system,  and a serial number unique to that message on the
          originating system,  i.e.:

               ^AMSGID: origaddr serialno

          The originating address should be specified in a form that
          constitutes a valid return address for the originating network.
          If the originating address is enclosed in double-quotes,  the
          entire string between the beginning and ending double-quotes is
          considered to be the orginating address.  A double-quote
          character within a quoted address is represented by by two
          consecutive double-quote characters.  The serial number may be
          any eight character hexadecimal number,  as long as it is unique
          - no two messages from a given system may have the same serial
          number within a very long period of time.  The manner in which
          this serial number is generated is left to the implementor.

     REPLY

     FIDONEWS 14-08               Page 7                   24 Feb 1997


          A REPLY line consists of the string "^AREPLY:" (where ^A is a
          control-A (hex 01) and the double-quotes are not part of the
          string),  followed by a space, and the origaddr and serialno
          fields of the MSGID line of the message to which this message is
          a reply,  i.e.:

             ^AREPLY: origaddr serialno

          The origaddr and serialno fields must be identical to the
          corresponding fields in the MSGID of the message to which this
          message is a reply.  A REPLY line is never generated in a
          message that is a reply to a message that does not contain a
          MSGID line.

     GENERAL

          For best results,  MSGID and REPLY lines should be the first two
          lines of the message after extended addressing lines (FMPT, TOPT,
          INTL, DOMAIN),  with MSGID appearing above REPLY.

          Finally,  a MSGID is generated only at the time of message
          creation.  An existing MSGID and/or REPLY should never be
          stripped from a message passing through an intermediate system.
          No system should ever add an MSGID and/or REPLY to,  or modify an
          existing MSGID / REPLY contained in,  a message not originating
          on that system.

              0.0) A QUICK INTRODUCTION AND STATEMENT OF INTENT

              The request for a gateway between WWIVnet and FidoNet through
              a program called  NetSEX was sent in  to Randy Bush (1:105/6)
              approximately a  month ago. During that  time there have been
              many questions pertaining to NetSEX  that I feel are relevent
              to the proposed gateway between WWIVnet and FidoNet.

              The major questions that I feel needs to be dealt with are:

                 Will it  be possible for  WWIV Technology Networks  to use
                 the  NetSEX gateway,  and if  so: will  a seperate gateway
                 agreement be necessary?

                 Will  it  be  possibile  for  WWIV  BBSes  that are not in
                 WWIVnet  or  WWIV  Technology  Networks  to  use NetSEX to
                 interface their BBS with FidoNet?

              The  current gateway  proposal that  I have  sent in pertains
              only to WWIVnet and FidoNet. What  I would like to do is have
              that policy  be between FidoNet  and a "NetSEX-Project"  that
              will keep  a list of  who's using NetSEX,  what their FidoNet
              address is, what their  WWIV Technology Network addresses are
              (for the NetSEX node and BBS  node), and if they gateway to a
              WWIV Technology Network: which one.

              To support  my reasoning I  will discuss each  question a bit
              and explain my proposal.

              1.0) WILL IT BE POSSIBLE  FOR WWIV TECHNOLOGY NETWORKS TO USE
              THE  NetSEX  GATEWAY,  AND  IF  SO:  WILL  A SEPERATE GATEWAY
              AGREEMENT BE NECESSARY?

              There have been several proposed-alternatives to WWIVnet that
              be  WWIV  Technology  Networks.  Various  planners from these
              networks have asked whether or not  they would be able to use
              NetSEX  to   gateway  between  FidoNet   and  their  proposed
              networks, and if so what steps would need to be taken.

              These proposed networks would be using BBSLIST.NET (a list of
              all nodes in the network,  similar to FidoNet's NODELIST) and
              CONNECT.NET (a  listing of all nodes  in the BBSLIST.NET file
              and how they  connect to one another-- a  topology map) files
              that are  independent of WWIVnet.  They would be  using their
              own nodenumbering schemes (however still be restricted to the
              65k maximum).

              There were  various possible things  offered by these  people
              that would possily work, but in  the end my response has been
              that the current proposed  policy between WWIVnet and FidoNet
              is between  those two networks,  and if they  were to gateway
              between their non-WWIVnet WWIV Technology Networks they would
              need to approach the FTSC for an agreement.

              1.1) WILL THERE BE ANY  POSSIBILITIES FOR WWIV BBSes THAT ARE
              NOT IN WWIVnet  OR WWIV TECHNOLOGY NETWORKS TO  USE NetSEX TO
              INTERFACE THEIR BBS WITH FidoNet?

              There  are   several  WWIV  BBSes  that   are  interested  in
              connecting  with FidoNet  but are  not interested  in joining
              WWIVnet (which  is the only network  currently operating with
              WWIV Technology).  Of the several people  who have asked, all
              of them are  running FourDog but would like  to get the speed
              of NetSEX  and the correct placing  of Netmail into mailboxes
              as opposed to the method FourDog uses.

              It is possible to run NetSEX on a non-WWIVnet BBS by creating
              the  data files  for a  WWIV Technology  Network that contain
              their  NetSEX  node  and  their  "WWIVnet"  node.  They would
              essentially be  faking out the software  by running a network
              consisting of two nodes.

              This  question I  have  been  unable to  sufficiently answer.
              While this situation would  involve someone that only belongs
              to  FidoNet, it  would still  be using  software designed  to
              gateway and it would be gatewaying messages from FidoNet to a
              WWIV Technology Network that consisted of one node.

              2.0) MY PROPOSED AGREEMENT

              What I  would like to do  is provide all sides  with the best
              possible solution that will privide  all sides with that same
              solution. As  it stands now, the  proposed gateway is between
              FidoNet  and WWIVnet.  What I  would rather  see is  a policy
              between  FidoNet and  an entity  called "The  NetSEX Project"
              that  would  keep  track  of  where  NetSEX  is being used to
              interface and/or  gateway with FidoNet. To  be more specific,
              and entity that would do the following:

                 a) keep  track of all WWIV-BBSes  running NetSEX simply to
                    interface with FidoNet. These would be systems that are
                    not in WWIVnet or any  other WWIV Technology Network. A
                    listing of their FidoNet  address, node number used for
                    the BBS,  and node number  used for the  NetSEX address
                    would be kept.

                 b) keep  track of all  WWIV-BBses running NetSEX  that are
                    connected to  a WWIV Technology  Network. A listing  of
                    their FidoNet address, the  name of the WWIV Technology
                    Network they  belong to, what  address they use  in the
                    WWIV Technology  Network, and the  address in the  WWIV
                    Technology Network they are using for their NetSEX node
                    would be kept.

                 c) do monthly or bi-monthly  tests of all NetSEX nodes and
                    create a conference (EchoMail for FidoNet, Sub for WWIV
                    systems) to support and discuss NetSEX.

                 d) have  a reserved range  in the WWIV  Technology Network
                    for  NetSEX  (and/or  other  gateways)  nodes, and have
     FIDONEWS 14-08               Page 10                  24 Feb 1997


                    someone in  that network serve as  a liason between the
                    "NetSEX Project" and the WWIV Technology Network.

                 e) upload all of the files  on one or more FidoNet systems
                    where  the various  members of  the FTSC  who work with
                    gateways can track down information they may need.

              Given   these  actions,   the  following   is  hoped   to  be
              accomplished:

                 a)  permit  non-WWIV  Technology  Network  systems  to use
                    NetSEX  while  being  covered  by  an agreement between
                    FidoNet to do so.

                 b) permit  non-WWIVnet yet still  WWIV Technology Networks
                    to  use  NetSEX  while  being  covered  by an agreement
                    between FidoNet and the "NetSEX Project" to do so.

                 c) keep an  index of all systems using  NetSEX, and keep a
                    listing of what WWIV Technology Networks are accessable
                    through FidoNet.

                 d)  offer   an  easy-access  place   for  people  to   get
                    information  pertaining  to  NetSEX,  FidoNet, and WWIV
                    Technology Networks.

              This proposed entity, the "NetSEX Project" would be an entity
              existing  off of  FidoNet. I  offer  to  do all  of the  data
              collection and  send the information to  the people who would
              like it (providing  it is of reasonable cost  phone the phone
              connections).

              There are many benefits, and no drawbacks that I can see.

              3.0) AN END NOTE

              I am expecting that  this will be approved, or  even if it is
              it will not be without some form of modification. It seems to
              me  that this  would be  the best  way to  handle the  NetSEX
              gateway  without  spending  a  great  deal  of time approving
              individual networks  that are based  around the same  network
              technology. This proposal was made  from the point of view of
              someone that are working from within FidoNet.

          Some Hints on Recognizing Control Lines in FidoNet(r) Message

     Implementors have had problems interpreting message text, both in
     netmail and echomail.  While the clues are usually to be found in some
     doucment or another, there seems to be a need to collect hints for
     some confusing aspects.  This informal documents attempts to address
     that need.

     Filter out all <lf>s and 'soft' <cr>s and <lf>s.  They are surplus and
     will only confuse the rest of your code.

     All control lines have their sentinels at the beginning of a line.  [
     Note that an * Origin: line has a leading significant blank. ]

     Do not process quoted control lines or control sentinels preceeded by
     blanks, tabs, ...

     If you become confused, then bounce or sidetrack the message to a hold
     area for human intervention.  Don't try to rescue the situation.  None
     will notice when you succeed, and many will flame whan you fail.

     A message is either netmail or echomail.  I.e. no ^aINTL, ^aFMPT, or
     ^aTOPT controls should be found or generated when there is an AREA:
     line or when in an echo area. Thus, echomail can not be routed across
     zones, but this is not a big loss.

     Private netmail replies to echomail are netmail, i.e. may have ^aINTL
     etc., and may not have AREA: line, SEEN-BY:, or ^aPATH: lines.  They
     may have a tear line and an origin line.

     FIDONEWS 14-08               Page 12                  24 Feb 1997


     ^aEID lines are as in Opus 1.03.  Other forms are not to be generated,
     and, if found, may be safely disgarded.

     An AREA: line must be the first non ^a line in the text.

     The echomail control info is a four-part package at the end of the
     text.  It should not be, but occasionally is, followed by one or more
     ^a control lines.  The four parts of an echomail trailer are:

       o a tear line, "---" and some very short text identifying the
         original echo processor.  Eg.
             --- Brag 3.14

       * note that some internetworking gateware may place a # Origin: line
         between the tear line and the * Origin: line to indicate the true
         other network address, whatver that may be.  The content of a #
         Origin: line is free to be specified by the other network(s).  An
         example might be as follows:
              # Origin: Political Statement (FishNet:914@201)

       o one * Origin: line, being " * Origin: " ends in "(" [Z:] N "/" N
         [.P] ")" of FidoNet node of origin or the gate from FidoNet to
         another network
              * Origin: <signature> (1:105/301)

       o as many SEEN-BY: lines as necessary, each being "SEEN-BY:"
         followed by one or more
             " " <net> "/" <node>
         sequences.  Note that SEEN-BY: lines do not end in <space>.

         The net/node numbers in SEEN-BY: lines are sorted net major.
         Within a single SEEN-BY: line, net numbers are sticky, so the N/N
         is usually abbreviated to N, Eg.
             SEEN-BY: 105/6 10 15 16 27 41 42 300 301 141/42 491

       o as many ^aPATH: lines as necessary, each being <ctrl-A> "PATH:"
         followed
         by one or more
             " " <net> "/" <node>
         sequences.  The N/N in ^aPATH: lines are specifically not sorted.
         Net numbers are also sticky in ^aPATH: lines, eg.
              PATH: 105/301 6 42

     Remember that traffic costs much money, and do not create text
     unnecessary to FidoNet as a whole.

     I did not invent this, so don't blame me.  I'm just trying to write it
     down.

     And, lastly, try not to be inventive.  While the free-form syntax of
     this embedded stuff does provide fleibility and power, it also leaves
     a lot of room to make disgusting messes.  Compromise, cooperation, and
     a minimizalist touch are essential.

      The Top Five List is taking the day off for President's Day,
     so we'll give you a list from a recent Windows Sources issue.
      Top Five can be found in the Shut Down section on the last
             page of Windows Sources each and every month.


              The Top 11 Signs Your Computer is Possessed


     11> Instead of flying appliances, your screen saver shows horned
         demons torturing your immediate family.

     10> The monitor spins and spews pea soup when you access the
         Vatican website.

      9> Bill Gates Screen Saver eyes follow your every move.

      8> Keeps throwing priests out of Windows.

      7> Hard disk crashes every time Pat Robertson e-mails you.

      6> Green slime oozing out of keyboard again and your kid hasn't
         used it in weeks.

      5> Tech support crew brings Norton Utilities and a crucifix.

      4> The little logo on it says: "Satan Inside."

      3> No matter what URL you type in, your browser opens up the
         www.hell.com web site.

      2> Dr. Watson replaced by Dr. Kervorkian.

     and the Number 1 Sign Your Computer is Possessed...


      1> Contrary to the startup screen, you're fairly certain Microsoft
         hasn't released Windows666 yet.
