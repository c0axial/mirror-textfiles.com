========================================================================
    This issue of FidoNews gets us back on track for publishing and for
delivery.  FidoNews is still being created manually due to a lack of
source for the MAKENEWS program files that did not get passed along by
the previous editor.  The pagination may be a mite choppy until I get
this down to a science or obtain MAKENEWS from somewhere.  Anyone out
there got a copy?  Please forward it ASAP to me at any of the addresses
listed herein.
    Anyone who submitted articles to the previous editor before, at or
around the time his last issue [13-22] came out will want to resubmit
those articles to this editor for inclusion in the next available
issue.  Submission standards are published in the file ARTSPEC.DOC
available here or from any Zone Coordinator and were the main subject
of last week's issue [13-23/27].

 FidoNews 13-28                 Page:  2                    8 Jul 1996
    ZC2 has publicized the changeover and the ARTSPECs and one of the
Nodes in his Zone is the first to be published.  I hope to see a lot
more participation in the other five Zones as soon as everyone finds
out that FidoNews lives again!
  Note:
    In 13-23/27, I posted the wrong file-request flag for this system.
In your flag override section for 1:1/23 make the flag XX and NOT XA as
previously announced.  This correction will appear in NODELIST.194 next
Friday.  The telephone number for override in 1:1/23 is 1-407-383-1372.
Or you can avoid these hassles by sending and freqing from my real Node
number of 1:374/14. [grin]

FidoNews - the Return of a newsletter

by Fredrik Bennison
2:205/300,  lomaxx@dalnet.se

I was beginning to think that we had seen the last of FidoNews when they
stopped dropping into my inbound directory.  Asking around if it was the
distribution that failed somewhere, I received the disappointing news
that no FidoNews had been compiled since Issue 1322...

But finally, this latest issue turned up and FidoNews is back in
business.  I'd like to thank Mr Christopher Baker for taking over the
Editorship after Mr Tees and wish him all the best for a long
FidoNews-filled future.

I'd also like to thank Mr Tees for the time he has spent publishing
FidoNews for the benefit of all of FidoNet.

SHARING-the FidoNet World Class, Global Communication Echo

Christopher Baker
Rights On!, 1:374/14
Titusville_FL_USA

There's a new Echo in town dedicated to the REAL spirit of FidoNet
Sysoping. It's called SHARING. Here's the blurb from the EListing:

What Sysops will see and learn in SHARING will make it "the
place to be." What they will see will be up to them but there
will be laughter and wonders and mysteries of FidoNet technology
will be explained. SHARE the wonderful experience of our hobby.
This Echo will be Awesome. It's the Swiss Army knife of information!
There's plenty to learn. Sysops can SHARE everything!
Every Sysop in the FidoNet phonebook [Nodelist] is invited to
participate but we will have a few simple rules. POLITENESS to each
other is EXPECTED! It is REQUIRED! The few off-topic topics are
contained in the accompanying SHARING.RUL file. The Moderators
 FidoNews 13-28                  Page:  3                   8 Jul 1996

reserve the right to declare off-topic any subject getting out of
the bounds of politeness and cooperation. The Backbone or any
backbone is off-topic automatically except as noted in the rules.

mod  Christopher Baker, 1:374/14
mod  jim barchuk, 1:141/355
mod  Debra Milner, 1:112/285
mod  Emeritus-Don Dawson, 1:150/730

Backbone status has been in effect for months so Areafix a link from
your local Backbone feed or contact any of the Moderators for a direct
link via Netmail.

Here's the SHARING Echo Guidelines for those without a copy of the
current ELRUL file:

Sorry, it's dirty work but someone has to do it.  :-)

What is this echo?
------------------
FidoNet is a World Class, Global, Communications Network of, by and for
FidoNet Sysops around the Globe.  There are other FTN networks but
none are of the size of FidoNet.

What Sysops will see and learn in SHARING will make it "the place to
be".  What might they see?  We don't have an agenda, hidden or
otherwise, but I'm sure we'll laugh at ourselves, cry for each other
and everyone will be "just themselves".

The wonders and mysteries of FidoNet Technology will be explained!.
Learn how and where files fall into dishes.  Learn how and where files
pop out of the InterNet tunnel.  Learn how to eat the Echomail Elephant
rather than have it eat you! Learn how to send e-mail to anywhere on the
Globe often with a local phone call, including to AOL, Prodigy, C$erve,
and perhaps that office down the street.  Learn there's no such thing as
FREE!

SHARE the wonderful experience of our hobby.  This echo is Awesome, it's
the Swiss Army knife of information!  There's plenty to learn, learn,
learn and it doesn't matter what hardware, operating system, mailer or
BBS Software a sysop uses.

 FidoNews 13-28                  Page:  4                   8 Jul 1996
Sysops can share those funny experiences we all have.  One of mine is a
brief story about NERF.BAT.  We can laugh with each other and cry with
each other. Yes, tragedy, sometimes simple, sometimes bizarre, hits us
all.  Why not share it?  There's good news too: someone is a new parent
for the first time, a new grandparent even.

Sysops find good deals on all sorts of goods and services.  Why not
SHARE where, how much and how good so we can all get the most out of our
hobby budget?

Please!
--------
What won't you see?  No anger.  No threats.  No intimidation. No
inappropriate language.  And none of that politistrivial junk so common
in other Sysop Echos.  No Zeroes. No Binary addresses allowed.  If
you're a 0 or a 1, stay away!  No a.k.a.'s allowed!  Use your real,
primary address or stay out, especially those 0's and 1's!  Simple
enough?

Every Sysop in any FTN phonebook is invited to participate, invited to
just be themselves and SHARE the FidoNet Technology Experience.  FidoNet
Technology Sysops are *very* special people, this echo is by, for and
about them.

Politeness to each other is EXPECTED!  It IS REQUIRED.  Almost no topic
is "off topic" except as noted below.  The Moderators reserve the right
to BAN any topic.  I reserve the right to "suspend discussion" of a
topic for a time certain.  Be CERTAIN of your FACTS, NAME names, don't
take the cowards way out by using "They said, He said".  Be SPECIFIC.

There are three Moderators. They are:

Christopher Baker;
jim barchuk; and
Debra Milner.

They are the only ones who will make Moderatorial pronouncements to
anyone else. Leave any Moderating to them. We don't expect to have to
do much in the way of moderating in a friendly and cooperative Echo.

Definitions:
------------

Phonebook:   The Nodelist

FidoGawd:    (or its variations) are prohibited from this Echo.

Fight-o-Net: (or its variations) are also prohibited.

Policy:      Policy4 as indicated in the nodelist. The ONLY policy.  If
             your zone/region/net also has a local policy, be specific.
             If you use Policy by itself, POLICY4 is assumed.

EchoPol:     It does not exist, never did.  Maybe never will.

 FidoNews 13-28                  Page:  5                   8 Jul 1996
CRP:         Cost Recovery Plan/Program.  I prefer Cost Sharing but you
             call it what you wish.

CRaP:        Something that sometimes accompanies participation in a 
             CRP.  It is and is intended to be an unflattering term.

Grunt Sysop: All 30,000+ PEOPLE in the FidoNet phonebook and or any FTN
             phone book.

backbone:    or Backbone, whichever you prefer is OFF Topic [except we
             will share how to get an Echo on the Backbone if asked.]

As Mr. Bartles and Mr. James are known to say: Thank you for your
                                               support!

We invite you to join us in a friendly and cooperative Echo for FidoNet

like adults and who would prefer a Sysop Echo with less tar. [grin]

FIDONEWS Echo - Direct link to FidoNews

Christopher Baker
FidoNews Editor, 1:1/23

I have created and EListed a new Echo devoted to FidoNews operations
and discussion related to content, editorial policy, distribution, and
submissions.

While awaiting placement on the Zone 1 Backbone and thence to other
linked Zones, this Echo will be available from this system and any of
those others who get a feed here and are willing to distribute to those
who wish access.

 FidoNews 13-28                  Page:  6                   8 Jul 1996
To link here for FIDONEWS Echo, send direct Netmail [you don't want to
route passwords, do you?] with a session password and an Areafix
password for your system.  If your system is in the U.S.A., the Echo
will be sent out three times a week. If your system is somewhere else
in the world, you'll have to poll.  I'll be glad to ship it overseas to
one collection point per Zone if you find volunteers but I cannot
afford to send it around the world.  Getting it on the Backbone and to
the Stars quickly will make it available to anyone who wants it at low
or no cost so start those requests to your Echomail Coordinators for
the addition of FIDONEWS Echo to the Backbone.  If anyone out there is
a FidoNet-to-Internet newsgroup/list expert, your assistance making it
available via the Internet is solicited.  Send Netmail or email to the
addresses listed at the end of all FidoNews issues.

Here are the posted Guidelines for the FIDONEWS Echo:

--- Following message extracted from FIDONEWS @ 1:374/14 ---

From: Christopher Baker

Date: 06 Jul 96  02:22:27
Subj: Welcome to the FidoNews Echo

This is the official home of FidoNews discussion in FidoNet hosted and
Moderated by the FidoNews Editor.

The Guidelines for this Echo are simple:

1. Traffic is related directly to FidoNews at the content, editorial,
   publishing, and/or distribution levels.

2. Personal attacks are NEVER permitted. Those who indulge in same will
   be escorted out of the Echo permanently after two warnings in the
   Echo and/or via Netmail. Stick to issues and avoid personalities.

3. Religion and politics are verboten.

4. FidoNews articles may be submitted via this Echo but it is the LEAST
   reliable method of getting yourself into print in FidoNews. Articles
   will be acknowledged so if you don't get an acknowledgment from the
   Editor within a week you'd better start thinking about resending or
   submitting via file attach to 1:1/23 or via Netmail.

5. This can be the "Complaint Department" for FidoNews ops if needed
   provided it doesn't get personal or flaming.

6. This Echo is not to be Gated outside of FidoNet without the notice
   and permission of the Moderator.

7. There is no rule 7.

These Guidelines may require occasional adjustment. "Nothing is
foolproof because fools are so ingenious." Anonymous  [grin]

The FIDONEWS Echo is available from FidoNews HQ [1:1/23] and eventually
the Zone 1 Backbone. Remember 1:374/14 is my REAL Node number if you
want to feed from here while Backboning is pending.

TTFN.
