                              WHAT CAN YOU DO?

     "Nobody made a greater mistake than he who did nothing because
     he could only do a little"   Edmund Burke.

     Everyone agrees that the state of the Earth's environment is
     in sad shape and is rapidly deteriorating.  Many organizations
     are trying to make changes enough to make a difference.  With-
     out joining an organization there are some simple things you
     can do to make a difference.

     Reduce the amount of garbage you generate by purchasing and
     using products wisely.

     "Precycle" by purchasing products in recyclable containers,
     such as aluminum, steel, glass, paper and cardboard.

     Purchase foods in bulk or concentrate.

     Avoid plastic and polystyrene (styrofoam) products that are
     neither reusable nor easily recyclable, such as disposable
     diapers, lighters razors and plastic utensils.  (Plastics make
     up 25% of our garbage by volume.)

     Make two-sided photocopies.

     Borrow items rather than buy them, for short-term or one-time
     use.

     Share magazine and newspaper subscriptions with friends.

     Keep a cloth towel next to the sink to be used instead of
     paper towels.

     Reduce the amount of junk mail you receive by contacting
     Direct Market Association, 6 E. 43rd St, New York, NY 10017,
     (202) 689-4977.

     Reuse products whenever possible.

     Use products that are made to be used many times, such as
     cloth diapers, cloth napkins, towels and rags, sponges,
     dishes, silver-ware, rechargeable batteries, etc.

     Carry a coffee mug with you to use in place of polystyrene cups.

     Bring your grocery and produce bags back to the supermarket
     and reuse them.

     Use the blank back sides of paper to take notes and do scratch
     work.

     Mend clothes and repair broken appliances.

     Take care of belongings to help them last longer.

     Look into purchasing used goods at second hand store and Junk
     yards.

     Recycle all materials possible. Many communities have
     established programs to recycle aluminum, steel, glass,
     newspaper and cardboard.  It is also possible to recycle
     magazines, colored paper, wood, oil and some plastics.

     Support a bottle bill that establishes a deposit on beverage
     containers.  Bottle bills that call for rewashing and reusing
     bottles are superior to traditional bottle bills.

     Help establish and promote a curbside recycling program if one
     does not already exist in your community.

     Organize a recycling program at your school, office, apartment
     building, church or local government office.

     Make a compost pile to recycle food scraps  and yard
     trimmings.  Kitchen and yard wastes make up one quarter of our
     waste stream.

     Recycle your used motor oil and car batteries at a local
     service station.

     Join grassroots organizations that have led the way in
     increased recycling. (list of some of the organizations are
     at the end of this article)

     Encourage the use of Recycled products:
     When shopping, look for the recycling symbol (three arrows
     forming a circle), indicating that the packaging was made from
     recycled materials.

     Use recycled paper at home and in your office. For every 23
     reams of recycled paper you use in place of virgin paper, one
     pulp tree is saved.

     Encourage your local newspaper to use recycled newsprint.

     Encourage companies you do business with to use recycled
     products.

                         WHY RECYCLE?

     Recycling saves energy, natural resources and landfill space.
     In 1990, it is projected that Americans will throw away over 1
     million tons of aluminum cans and foil, more than 11 million
     tons of glass bottles and jars, over 4 and a half million tons
     of office paper, and nearly 10 million tons of newspaper.
     Almost all of this material could be recycled, cutting down on
     the environmental damage caused by mining, logging, and manufac-
     turing raw materials, while decreasing the amount of garbage
     being dumped.  The average American generates 3.5 pounds of
     garbage every day for a national total of over 160 million tons
     per year.  Over 80 percent of this waste could be recycled
     using existing technologies.

     Global warming, acid rain, and oil spills are problems directly
     related to our extravagant use of energy.  Three percent of our
     nation's energy is used to produce packaging materials, such as
     bottles and cans.  By recycling aluminum it is possible to save
     95 percent of the energy that it would take to manufacture new
     products from raw materials.  In other words, throwing away an
     aluminum can wastes as much energy as if the can were half full
     of gasoline.  Americans throw away about 35 million aluminum cans
     every year.  If all these cans were recycled, we would save an
     amount of energy equivalent to 150 Exxon Valdez oil spills
     annually.  In 1988, Americans set an all time high by recycling
     42.5 billion cans.  This alone saved enough energy to supply
     power for the city of Boston for one full year.

     For every ton of paper that is manufactured from recycled pulp,
     17 trees are saved and 3 cubic yards of waste paper avoids being
     landfilled.  Since paper comprises over 40 percent of our
     municipal waste stream, recycling could extend the lives of our
     existing dumps considerably.  For recycling to work, however, it
     is important that there is a market for the new product.  The
     U.S. uses about 40 percent of the world's newsprint supply, yet
     only 14 percent of this paper is made from recycled fiber.
     Recycled paper uses up to 64 percent less energy to manufacture
     than virgin paper and produces only one-quarter the air
     pollution.

     As you can see, there are many good reasons to recycle.  The
     first step is to acquire more information.  Consider the
     following Subjects: Precycle, Reuse, Recycle, and Encourage the
     purchase and use of products that are made with recycled
     material and are recyclable.

     The Master Recyclers, a program of the Washington State
     University Extension Office of Kitsap County is engaged in
     an effort to encourage and promote recycling.  We need your
     help in gathering information for inclusion in our data base.
     Specific information we need is sources of information
     concerning the following subjects: Recycling manufacturers,
     FidoNews 7-35                Page 5                   27 Aug 1990


     Manufacturers of products containing recycled material, manufac-
     turers of packaging containing recycled material, and any
     sources of recycled material or information on products made
     from recycled material.

     Information may be addressed to the originator of this article,
     or postal mailed to: Mike Robeson, 1610 Kitsap Lake Rd. NW,
     Bremerton, WA 98312.

     Remember, If you're not recycling, you're throwing it away!

      THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE HOME, For Hazardous Waste.

     Household drains and garbage cans usually aren't
     considered conduits for hazardous waste. But products as
     toxic as arsenic and as persistent as DDT are often poured
     down the kitchen sink or thrown out in the trash.  This
     carelessness can cause serious problems.

     Powerful chemical products for home use include drain
     cleaners, disinfectants, degreasers, pesticides, paints, ect.
     These products also are potentially hazardous wastes.

     Hazardous Waste is any material discarded from the home
     that may, due to its chemical nature, pose a threat to human
     or environmental health if handled improperly. It may be
     ignitable, corrosive, explosive, poisonous, or have other or
     a combination of dangerous properties. And its difficult to
     control because it comes from diverse sources.

     Industrial waste disposal is strictly regulated. Disposal
     of household hazardous waste is not, even though it may
     contain the same toxic substances.

     The problem of household hazardous waste almost defys
     discription.  The scope of the problem is gigantic.  Example,
     Washington State citizens tossed an extimated 14,700,000
     pounds of household hazardous waste into local sanitary
     landfills in 1987.

     Improper use and disposal of hazardous household products
     has caused poisoning, chemical burns, exposure to toxic
     fumes, contamination of ground water, fish kills, and
     explosions in sewers, garbage trucks, landfills and homes.

     Small amounts of hazardous chemicals are widespread
     throughout our homes, garages, and storage sheds - often
     unsafely stored.

     The solution starts at home.  Each person can help control
     household toxics.  Purchasing power can be used to give
     industry the incentive to produce safer household products.
     Local governments can help provide hazardous waste
     management plans and provide public education.  State
     government has grant and technical assistance programs for
     household hazardous waste projects and planning.

      HOW TO IDENTIFY A HAZARDOUS PRODUCT

     FidoNews 7-35                Page 7                   27 Aug 1990


     Federal law requires that hazardous products be labled:
     "DANGER" or  "CAUTION".  Each word indicates the degree of a
     product's toxicity,  "DANGER" being the most toxic,
     "CAUTION" being the least.  Toxicity is capacity of a
     substance to cause damage to an organism.  Other words on a
     lable like poison, corrosive, flammable, volatice, or
     caustic, help to determine the principal hazard of the
     product.  Lables rarely warn of long-term health hazards, and
     labeling requirements do not apply to most hobby products.
     Inadequate as they are, lables do contain helpful information
     for many hazardous products.  Knowing the meaning of signal
     words can help users make informed product and disposal
     choices.

     COMMON EXAMPLES OF HOUSEHOLD HAZARDOUS WASTES:

     Paints and Solvents; Oil-based paints, paint thinners, paint
     strippers, boat bottom paints, varnishes, furnisher refinishers,
     metal polishes.

     Auto Care Products; Engine cleaner, used motor oil, tar remover,
     antifreeze, gasoline.

     Cleaners; Bleach, degreasers, spot removers, rug cleaners,
     disinfectants, toilet cleaners, oven cleaners, drain
     cleaners, septic tank cleaners.

     Pesticides; Pest stips, insect repellant, flea powder, ant and
     roach powder, rat poison, slug bait, moth balls, weed killers,
     wood preservatives.

     Miscellaneous Items; Dyes, lighter fluids, pool chemicals, photo
     chemicals, chemistry sets, old fire extinguishers, old medicines.

      SAFETY TIPS FOR HAZARDOUS PRODUCTS

     1. Read product labels, follow directions and warnings.
     2. Keep unused material in the original containers, lables
        intact, securely stored.
     3. Do not overuse products. Twice as much won't work twice as
        well.
     4. Never mix Products - dangerous reactions could occur.
     5. Never mix wastes - it could create a difficult disposal
        problem.
     6. Don't use old hazardous products: they may contain
        dangerous chemicals that have been banned.
     7. Wear protective equipment such as goggles, cloves, or
        respirators with proper cartridges when using hazardous
        material.  Conuslt your telephone directory under
        "safety equipment" for stores that carry safety gear.
     8. Avoid breathing mists or vapors.  If possible, work out-
     FidoNews 7-35                Page 8                   27 Aug 1990


        doors, if you must work indors, use plenty of ventilation.
     9. If pregnant? avoid exposure to all toxic chemicals.  Many
        household products are untested for their effects on the
        unborn.

     For further information on the subject of Hazardous waste or
     any other environmental subjects contact your county health
     department, local University Extension Agent, your state's
     Department of Ecology or your library system.

                         FIND HEIDI SITUATION SHEET

                                                         August 16, 1990

      On August 4, 1990, 11-year old Heidi Seeman was abducted not far
      from her home in northeast San Antonio.  Volunteers from
      Randolph Air Force Base, where Heidi's father is stationed,
      helped community volunteers organize a search which, by week's
      end involved more than 6,000 San Antonio civilian and military
      residents.  Searches were conducted on foot, horseback, and in
      off-road vehicles.  Additionally, a thorough search was conducted
      by air using helicopters, ultra light and private aircraft.
      Searchers also used dog teams when following up on specific leads.

      The Mayor of San Antonio proclaimed Saturday August 11, 1990 as
      "Find Heidi Day" and asked everyone to spend at least one hour
      searching areas around their neighborhoods.  Officials believe
      that as many as 300,000 residents joined in the search.  Sunday,
      San Antonio observed a day to "Take Heidi to Church" in their
      hearts and their prayers.

      Despite the diligent efforts of the volunteers to find Heidi,
      no trace of her has been found.  Yet volunteers continue to come
      forward to help search, distribute flyers, and transmit computer
      images to other locations.  The massive search for Heidi stems
      from an overwhelming concern by San Antonio people for the safety
      of their own children.  They are saying that all children are at
      risk unless we do something to prevent such crimes.

      The search has now expanded nationwide, with a reward in excess
      of $50,000.  This weekend, Heidi's disappearance will be covered on
      the Fox network program, "America's Most Wanted".  We ask for your
      help to copy and distribute material in an attempt to find her.

      Won't you help?

      Heidi is 11 years old, 4' 10" tall and weighs 70 pounds. She has
      light brown hair and green eyes. At the time of her disappearance
      she was wearing a white, collarless shirt, purple shorts,
      black and white polka dot tennis shoes, and white socks.

                             Another IFNA??
                             --------------

                           By Kwityer Bychin

     Hey, I'm back. Being that I ran off  at  the  mouth  a  little
     about IFNA last week, I decided that I'd take that  subject  a
     little further and address the concerns of those  PEOPLE  that
     think we need an IFNA replacement.

     Since  IFNA  bought  the  farm,  there've  been  quite  a  few
     twisted people moaning and whining about starting up  a  *NEW*
     Politburo to run Fidonet.

     Hey guess what sister? We don't NEED a new  IFNA.  We've  been
     doing just FINE without an IFNA  for  almost  two  years  now,
     because when it WAS around, it didn't do SQUAT.

     Look at good 'ol Fight-O-Net this  way...  You  got  a  mailer
     that can send stuff to other mailers. You  got  a  list  of  a
     WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE that you can send your stuff to. So SEND
     your  stuff  and   KWITYER   BYCHIN.   You   don't   need   no
     "organization" to run your system for you. You know the rules,
     you got the policy document, now PLAY THE GAME or GET LOST.

     Even though the network will do just FINE  without  any  kinda
     politburo, SOMEBODY is gonna try to whip one up and take  over
     the  network.  AGAIN.  Yep,  BANK  ON  IT.   Some   group   of
     bureaucratic control freaks will undoubtedly make a  pitch  to
     conquer Fidonet sooner or later. And maybe they'll even  do  a
     NETWORK WIDE REFERENDUM! Yeah! They'll put out a question like
     "We are taking over Fidonet. Vote NO if you don't want that to
     happen". And the same 30% of the network will vote  like  they
     did last time, and WHAM! Instant takeover. Pretty neat  huh??!
     Try this at home.

     Or maybe we'll see some  Presnellian  democratic  takeover  of
     Fidonet! Hey, that would  be  fun!  Adjustable  Democracy!  Or
     maybe The Freddies will take over, and require  you  to  be  a

                    TechCon-I, The Report (part 2)


     This is the second and last part of the TechCon-I report. The
     first part appeared in FidoNews 734.

     First, an apology. I noticed in the logfile of 2:295/27 that
     someone had tried to request some of the technical documents
     that were distributed at TechCon. He only got one, because of a
     ridiculously low MaxReq setting (the person in question was a
     point). This limit has since been increased to 5, with a
     maximum of 250Kbytes for unlisted nodes and 550Kbytes for
     listed-ones. That should do it.


     IFF (Interchange File Format) -- Maximilian Hantsch
     ---------------------------------------------------

     Maximilian Hantsch (2:310/6) told us that Electronic Arts, a
     US based software company, had come up with a file format
     which was sufficiently general for it to be used to store
     data of any kind. The initial purpose was to allow different
     programs, running on the same platform (i.e. the Commodore
     Amiga) to interchange data consistently. It could, however,
     be used to interchange data between different platforms as
     well, and that is one of the reasons IFF was on the agenda at
     TechCon.

     Max briefly talked about the efforts in NET_DEV to come to a
     "Type-III Packet". One of the possibilities is the RFC822
     document, which actually looks a lot like the kludges we
     currently use in FidoNet Type-II Packets, except that there's
     no fixed binary header. RFC822 is being widely used in
     professional, as well as in amateur networks.

     Another notable proposition for a future format is the
     'binary chunks' proposal. Max likes this proposal a lot, and
     this is no coincidence, because its structure is very similar
     to IFF. Both structures consist of chunks, which have a 4-
     byte ASCII identifier, a length field, and the specified
     number of data bytes. The length field is only one byte in
     length in the binary chunks proposal, while it is a 32-bit
     unsigned integer in IFF.

     A second-level definition of IFF (the above structure
     definition being the first level) would be that chunks can
     contain 1 or more chunks themselves. Another step up the
     hierarchical ladder, we find that a number of predefined
     forms (specific configurations of nested chunks) can be used
     as building blocks in IFF files as well.

     FidoNews 7-35                Page 13                  27 Aug 1990


     Since IFF was initially designed specifically to be used on
     the Commodore Amiga, all 16- and 32-bit numbers need to be
     stored in the Motorola-order. They need to be stored at word-
     boundaries as well, which means that pad bytes need to be
     inserted if a chunk has an odd length.

     We need to make sure that the chunk types (the 4-char
     identifiers) are allocated centrally, so that no two
     programmers use the same identifier for an entirely different
     chunk type. Commodore-Amiga has set up an approval body,
     which is part of CATS (Commodore-Amiga Technical Support),
     with which chunk type identifiers can be registered. (Why not
     use different smileys for identifiers in FidoNet?, JC).

     Max went on to discuss a number of IFF-standard chunk types
     (FORM, LIST, CAT and PROP) which provide for the orderly
     arrangement of data, as well as providing a means to define
     the scope for common properties. He explained how to parse
     these standard chunk types as well.

     A remark was made that it might be better to stop talking
     about a type-III PACKET, and instead call it a new type of
     BUNDLE. Otherwise, people might think that we're trying to
     change the basic FidoNet protocol. This is entirely
     unnecessary, since we would still transmit a type-II packet
     during FTS-0001 sessions, which can be followed by any kind
     of file. Actually, this is the way in which echomail is
     currently being moved, albeit that the archives contain type-
     II packets...

     Finally, this standard uses other standards. The FTXT FORM
     type makes use of the same ISO character set as does
     Microsoft Windows, for example. The standard was placed in
     the public domain, and example code has been placed in the
     public domain as well. It is available from 2:295/27 as
     IFF_88.ZOO (515K). Max may have it up for file request as
     well, but I'm not sure. Many attendants took this file home
     with them as well, so you may find it near you.


     Message FOSSILs - Panel discussion with Henk, Bob, Vince,
     Alexander and Max
     ---------------------------------------------------------

     What this is really all about is a database interface layer.
     We want to define a high-level interface, while the
     implementation is platform dependent.

     Vince remarks that Wynn Wagner has been studying a way of
     handling messages that was similar to IFF (a binary-style
     message structure); Alexander feels that IFF would not be a
     proper way of storing messages on disk.

     FidoNews 7-35                Page 14                  27 Aug 1990


     Another issue is platform independence. Henk mentions the
     fact that Novell's B-Trieve is available on lots of
     platforms, but this doesn't allow for compatibility with
     existing message base formats. Existing programs that make
     use of specific message base formats, without accessing the
     message base through the message FOSSIL, are a problem:
     integrity cannot be maintained in a multitasking situation
     where one of the tasks accesses the message base without
     making use of the message FOSSIL.

     Bob feels that whatever we do, we mustn't slow things down,
     however nice the features we add may be.

     One part of the panel feels that too many people have been
     involved in the NET_DEV-version of this discussion for
     anything to really happen, while the others think that this
     is too big a project for a single person. A limited number of
     developers should sit together and "just do it". The key
     people would probably be the major BBS authors, as they could
     lead the way in this. Lots of utility developers would soon
     follow.

     Maximilian Hantsch (2:310/6) has volunteered to coordinate
     the efforts. If anyone has already written message FOSSIL
     specs, or is even busy writing code that uses a message
     FOSSIL, you are requested to contact Max and to share ideas
     with him. Please take into account that Max's system is not CM.

     A brain storming on what the actual interface should look
     like yields the following: perhaps we should use a SQL
     subset, in order to support multi tasking, programs should be
     written to take error messages into account (cannot perform
     this or that function because this or that resource is
     locked,...). Henk briefly sums up what type of functions a
     message FOSSIL should incorporate: initialize message base,
     initialize area, open+close area, open+close message,
     read+write message, (we'd probably need to be able to access
     the header and the body separately).


     The-Box -- Arjen Lentz
     ----------------------

     Arjen talked about his mailer, which is available both for
     the PC and for the Atari ST. Sadly, Arjen's talk was not
     recorded on tape and I wouldn't dare publish something on it
     from memory. I have informed him of the problem, and he will no
     doubt publish an article when his mailer's documentation
     becomes available.

     Global Configuration File -- Maximilian Hantsch
     -----------------------------------------------

     Programs requiring configuration can either extract this
     information from other programs' configuration files, or have
     the user construct configuration files of their own. In the
     latter case, a lot of information is bound to be duplicated,
     thereby increasing the chance of introducing inconsistencies
     by forgetting to change all the occurrences of a particular
     piece of information in all the configuration files.

     This could be solved by introducing a format for a global
     configuration file, i.e. a configuration file which contains
     configuration information for use by more than one program
     (preferably all).

     Max based his talk on a document written by Martin Laubach,
     who based the format he proposes on the Microsoft Windows
     configuration file (WIN.INI), with the addition of a global
     section.

     Here's the format:

         global_config_verb_1 options_1
         global_config_verb_2 options_2
         ...
         [program_name_1]
         config_verb_local_to_program_1 local_options_1
         config_verb_local_to_program_2 local_options_2
         ...
         [program_name_2]
         ...

     If a particular config verb is specified both in a local and
     in the global section, the local options will take precedence
     over the global options for the program the local config verb
     is local to. In other words: global specifications are valid
     for all programs, unless they are overridden in local
     sections.

     A file containing Martin Laubach's document is available from
     2:295/27 as NEWCFG.LZH (2860 bytes).


     Character Sets -- Maximilian Hantsch
     ------------------------------------

     Maximilian described a number of 8-bit character sets. A
     kludge line specifying which character set a message was
     written in does not solve the problem where people's names
     (in the From and To fields of the header) contain non-ASCII
     characters.

     FidoNews 7-35                Page 16                  27 Aug 1990


     Part of the audience (myself included, JC) feels that a
     change of character sets requires sweeping enough changes to
     software for the changes to be done thoroughly the first time
     around. Why stick to 8 bits if people like the Chinese have
     been asking us (in the Meadow conference for example) for a
     way to support their multibyte characters.

     An argument against this is the fact that many of the
     languages requiring multibyte characters aren't written left-
     to-right, and one line under the other. It would therefore be
     difficult to write software that is sufficiently general to
     handle all of this.



     That's about it. As you all can see, we've had fun. The
     discussions were very informative (we've all learned a lot) and
     were completely free of the kind of bitching that continuously
     goes on in NET_DEV. BTW: I hope that's not one of the reasons
     why the previous moderator of NET_DEV has become the *previous*
     moderator of NET_DEV.

     Another point. What you've read in this report only reflects
     (or tries to reflect) what happened at TechCon during the more
     or less planned sessions. There have been 'fringe meetings' in
     several of Antwerp's world famous "staminees" (from the French
     word 'estaminet').

     As a matter of fact, Henk Wevers turned up a bottle of Bink
     beer during one of those fringe meetings, which he presented
     (empty, of course) to Bob and Vince the following morning. A
     local sysop, Erik De Schrijver, found out about the brewery,
     and arranged a guided tour for them. You should have seen their
     proud faces when they came back home that evening, each
     carrying 24 bottles of a beer named after their brain child.
     Touching...

     U Can't Touch This.

     Missed me ?  I thought not. I've been on the campaign trail,
     running for RC in our Region 19 elections.  Campaigning is
     probably not the right word, more like passive participation.
     Our current RC decided to hold an REC election at the same
     time, which has caused flames like a Kuwaiti well blowout.  We
     also get to try and vote on a Regional Policy, one of which
     would make these elections a permanent arrangement.  Watch your
     nodelist for the results, maybe.


     Is there a Disk Doctor in the House ? --

     Norton Utilities 5.0 was there, so I bought it.  I owed them
     one, now I don't.  I remember back in Summer of '87, I had been
     running DOS 3.2 and switched to Compaq DOS 3.31.  BIG
     PARTITIONS.  I was so happy.  But then, disaster.  I am always
     sorting my directories, and I had always used Norton's DS,
     circa version 3 or something like that.   Anyway, I actually
     was forced back to multiple 32 meg partitions on that disk
     until Norton 4 arrived.  Late '87, I think, and of course, it
     supported the BIGDOS partition, and DS worked and I was a happy
     camper.  Damn the sector size, full speed ahead.
     Can't touch this.

     As a side note on DS, I seem to want mostly DATE order, so that
     the end of a DIR shows me the latest files.  I PATCH the dates
     on the directory entries themselves so that a full disk date
     sort puts the directories in least to most used order !  On the
     BBS file directories, I use ALPHA order, except the new uploads
     area, which is DATE order.  This matches the order of my FILES
     LISTs, and seems to be faster for BBS user display.

     So anyway, I dutifully archived Norton 4.5 and loaded up 5.0.
     What a DISASTER.  The interactive apps are OK, a little gaudy
     with all the latest pretty menu, mousey type, pull downs, etc.
     I think it looks alot like what PCTOOLS advertises ( I never
     bought it for that reason. )

     BUT the batchable commands are a horror(sp).  The docs say that
     DS is replaced with SpeedDisk, but I couldn't find it.  Then I
     noticed the docs telling me to keep DS, and quite a few other
     4.5 commands around. Interesting, in a sardonic kind of way.

     I don't know what to say, something like : Buy Norton 4.5 before
     your retailer runs out ?  This is like the New Coke/Classic
     Coke thing, hopefully Symantec will lose their butt and return
     to the UNIX style utilities we have known and loved.

                           LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
     =================================================================

     Bob Morris 1:141/333

     Dear Editor;

     I have just gotten up off the floor after reading the column by
     Kwityer.  Must admit that I haven't had this much fun since
     drinking Anchor Steam Beer in the WOC in in Sin-City.

     I honestly don't know where people come from to create batch
     files that "break" when someone changes the extension.  I have
     the old batch files from 16/0 (circa pre-Harry Lee and pre-Pete
     White having just returned from a couple of years doing testing
     on OSIRIUS and ISIS) and darned if the batch files (created in
     1987 don't say "If exist fnews*.* copy fnews*.*
     e:\fido\fidonews".  I guess my point here is that if you hard
     code something that may change, you are definitely going to
     "Break" it when you are not around to change it, but "Big Deal"
     this is a "HOBBY" and we are not running Computer Centers for
     large corporations out of our homes (at least I hope not).

     To Vince and Harry, it was time that someone took the bull (no
     pun intended) by the horns and made a decision.  IFNA, the
     democratic entity, is dead, we have come full circle again and
     are once again a "Dictatorship" (if you don't understand that one
     you have not been around long enough).

     The gar... er stuff that has appeared in EchoMail and in this
     publication is pure hogwash!  Lharc is a Public Domain Package,
     it has source code available, if some of the people who have
     complained the loudest would have spent 50% of the time they did
     complaining in converting LHARC to their individual machine
     requirements we all would have had five or six more versions of
     the product converted by now.

     To those who want to know, I know the "REAL" identity of Kwityer,
     and for some heavy duty bucks will fill you in, after all I have
     to split it with Kwityer <grin>.
