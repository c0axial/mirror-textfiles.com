        Disclaimer or dont-blame-me:

        The contents of the articles contained here are not my 
        responsibility, nor do I necessarily agree with them; 
        everything here is subject to debate. I publish EVERYTHING 
        received.  

        You can take this to mean anything you want, but hopefully 
        as an invitation to comment, make suggestions, or write 
        articles of your own.  

                             ARTICLE SUBMISSION

        All articles you see in this issue are written by users and 
        sysops, and have one way or another managed to consume disk 
        space on Fido #375. In order to get rid of them, and free up 
        my precious disk space, I include them here, then quickly 
        delete them. Then they are YOUR problem.  

        EDITORIAL CONTENT:

        Totally up to you; I publish anything at all. Articles are 
        generally Fido or BBS related; this is by no means a 
        decision on my part, nor a requirement.  

        FOR SALE, WANTED, NOTICES:

        Pretty much self explanatory. Commercial ads are welcomed, 
        if of reasonable length.  

        SUBMITTING AN ARTICLE:

        Manage to get a copy of your article to Fido #375, 
        preferably by Fidonet mail, or by uploading.  The name of 
        the file you send MUST have one of the following extensions: 

            .ART      An article
            .SAL      A "For Sale" notice
            .WAN      A "Wanted" item

        ARTICLE FORMAT: VERY IMPORTANT! PLEASE READ!

        The requirements are a little tighter in this department, 
        due to purely practical constraints.  I cannot devote hours 
        to converting every text format in the world to the one I 
        use.  

        1.  NO LEFT MARGINS! Flush left please.  We will do the 
            indenting at our end, thank you.  

        2.  RIGHT MARGIN AT COLUMN 60 OR LESS! Less is OK, more is 
            definitely not. This includes fancy boxes, dotted lines, 
            etc.  

        3.  NO FUNNY CHARACTERS!  This includes formfeeds and other 
            oddities.  

        4.  NO GRAPHIC CHARACTERS! Believe it or not, not every one 
            in the world has an IBM PC. My computer understands 
            printable characters from 20 hex to 7e hex. (Space to 
            tilde) This is ASCII; "American Standard Code for 
            Information Interchange". We are "Interchanging 
            Information". Everything else is GARBAGE. ASCII is 
            universal; Graphics are not.  

        5.  TOTAL ARTICLE LENGTH: Up to you; note, however, that I 
            will probably avoid publishing dictionaries, bibles 
            translated into NAPLPS, and ASCII encoded LANDSAT 
            pictures of Russian wheat farms.  

        6.  WHERE ON EARTH IS THIS ARTICLE FROM? Well ... good 
            question! A good idea to identify yourself somewhere, 
            unless you wish to remain anonymous. Thats okay too, but 
            I may balk at publishing rude or otherwise racy 
            submissions.  

        7.  You don't need to put in separator lines at the top or 
            bottom.  They are added automatically when Fidonews is 
            assembled.  

        Any article that doesn't meet the above criteria will get 
        bounced, and will not be published until someone gets around 
        to fixing it.  I might go over it and fix it up in time for 
        the next issue, or I might ask you to try again, or I might 
        just forget about it.  In any event, you must meet these 
        standards if you expect your article to be published 
        promptly.

                          The New Kid on the Block


        That's me.  This is my first issue as editor of Fidonews.  
        Since you are reading this, then obviously I've at least 
        figured out how to put the paper together.  So far, so good.

        I've already made a few changes, but almost all of them are 
        internal things, dealing with how Fidonews is assembled, and 
        shouldn't really affect anyone but me.  No big deal, really.  
        Everyone develops their own methods for doing things.  Tom 
        Jennings and I have developed different methods, is all.

        My short range goal is to totally automate the production of 
        Fidonews, so that it will get out on time even if I'm out of 
        touch for awhile.  This should be no big problem, as long as 
        contributors abide by the submission standards (above).  
        This is really more your newsletter than mine, anyway.  I 
        just put together the pieces and send it out, maybe with a 
        little note from me to you tucked away somewhere.

        So don't think of this as "my" paper, or even as Fido's 
        paper (pun NOT intentional).  Think of it as YOUR paper.

                                    * * *

        I've seen at least four different methods of naming 
        Fidonews.  The one I've decided to go with is:

                 FIDOvnn.NWS

        Where "v" is the volume number, and "nn" is the issue 
        number.  I've renamed all my back copies this way, and I 
        plan on naming all future issues this way.  What you will 
        do, I have no idea.

        But speaking of issue numbers, there seems to have been some 
        confusion on this in the past.  Here's the record for 1985, 
        as best as I've been able to determine:

                Old                                     New

        The publication date is the date the issue was actually 
        assembled, as given in the page headers.  The issue date is 
        the nominal "date of issue", as given just above the picture 
        of the doggie.  These are never required to match, which is 







FIDONEWS     --           01 Apr 85  01:35:53           Page 4

        why you get the March issue of a magazine in January.

        The "old" issue number is the number given in the issue 
        itself.  As you can see, there was a trivial error in the 
        issue numbering, so I numbered my back copies according to 
        the "new" issue numbers.  So, by my count, this should now 
        be volume 2, number 8.  And so it is.

                      MULTI-TASKING FOR LESS THAN $160

              MULTI-TASKING AND MULTI-USER FOR LESS THAN $255.

                           By Robert Bosche', Jr.
                 Co-SYSOP Fido #66 (714) 642-4408 - 24-Hours

        If you are like most SYSOPS, you probably run your Fido BBS 
        during the hours you're not using the computer for local 
        tasks. One computer is not just enough to handle FIDO BBS 24 
        hours a day and run your other programs at the same time.  
        Until recently we found ourselves in the same situation, and 
        disappointed many of our faithful callers while we burned 
        the midnight oil. We now run Fido #66 on a 24-Hour basis on 
        our only computer and plan to add a second Fido to the same 
        computer in the near future.  

        During working hours we run other programs such as R:Base 
        4000, Microrim's XRW, Wordstar, 1-2-3, PC-TALK III, and 
        various editors and DOS files in the `foreground' while Fido 
        #66 runs in the `background', on the same computer.  

        To say there is no noticeable degradation would be 
        stretching the truth, but I will say that the degradation is 
        acceptable, even with three tasks/programs running at the 
        same time.  

        Over the past three months, we tested a number of multi-
        tasking/multi-user packages for compatibility with Fido and 
        other popular packages, as well as for speed, degradation, 
        other quirks, and finally cost.  We can recommend two of 
        them, one for about $160, and one for about $495. Most users 
        can get by well with the $160 package. At these prices, it 
        certainly beats buying another computer for the present. I 
        will explain the differences later. Let's call them p$160 
        and p$495 for short.  

        P$160 turns your PC-DOS 2.10 & 3.x (not MS-DOS) compatible 
        computer into a true timesharing system running up to 9 PC-
        DOS compatible programs concurrently.  








FIDONEWS     --           01 Apr 85  01:35:55           Page 5

        Up to 9 separate jobs can be run at the same time, but this 
        really depends on the CPU and RAM demands of each program 
        you run. For our purposes, we find 2 or 3 jobs to be the 
        reasonable maximum for our own application mix.  

        You don't have to bring FIDO down any more to run other 
        programs, or get out of your wordprocesssor to copy a file 
        in another directory, just switch back and forth between 
        jobs. It's like switching between computers.  

        With p$160 the keyboard and screen can be assigned to any 
        job, and all other jobs continue to run unattended.  

        P$160 requires no additional hardware. An additional $90 
        buys the Multi-user version of the package. It uses one 
        standard serial port for each additional user (NOT BAD for a 
        MULTIUSER SYSTEM). Remote users can be connected either by 
        modem or direct via a null modem cable.  

        Direct connection yields transmission rates up to 19.2K 
        baud. RAM size may need to be increased according to program 
        requirements. We recommend 640K, which is the maximum 
        directly accessable memory for the IBM-PC/XT & Compatable.  

        P$160 is simple to install, and requires only a one-line 
        addition to your AUTOEXEC.BAT to allocate memory to each 
        job's partition. Once booted, any program compatible with 
        IBM PC-DOS may be loaded.  

        Simple keystrokes can then cause any job/program to appear 
        on the foreground screen, while the other jobs/programs 
        continue to run in the background partition.  

        Additional p$160 parameters allow you to assign processing 
        priorities/time to specific jobs according to your needs.  

        We have been and continue to work with the developers of 
        this package to enhance its capabilities even further.  

        P$495 surpasses p$160 in a few respects which may be 
        requisites of your system. P$495 allows use of many IBM 
        compatible computers running under PC-DOS in a multitasking 
        and multiuser environment.  

        P$495 also allows you to implement a number of background 
        routines which actually control the way certain `unfriendly' 
        software packages manipulate video RAM. The unfriendly 
        software then performs normally from the user's vantage 
        point, but in such a way that it cannot interfere with or 
        overwrite allocated portions of video RAM. The best example 
        of an unfriendly program is one that manipulates screen 
        memory.  

        P$495 supports remote access to DOS, so you can run programs 
        from a remote location.  

        P$495 also supports a memory expansion card which allows DOS

        to direct-access up to 4 megabytes of memory.  

        Think about the capabilities and use of these package(s).  
        The 4 megabyte memory expansion card and multi-port (4 to 8) 
        serial cards are also available.  

        Please give us a call for additional information. We'll be 
        more than happy to work with you to resolve any questions 
        and supply any of the required software or hardware at very 
        reasonable prices.

        From: Jon Tara on FIDO #92
        Subject: AT hard disk rumors

        Disclaimer: This is pure conjecture.  I've take a few slips 
        of the tongue from various sources, and put them together to 
        make a viable rumor...  

             IBM will soon announce the availabilty of a "40MB" 
        PC-AT.  Because consumer confidence in the ill-fated 20MB AT 
        drive is so low, IBM may even offer the 40MB AT at the same 
        price as the current 20MB model, and offer to upgrade 
        existing 20MB drives.  

             The new drive is actually a 33MB (formatted) drive from 
        CMI - the same company that makes the 20MB drive.  Some 
        marketing genius at IBM decided, though, to follow the lead 
        of the sleazier end of the micro industry, and use the 
        unformatted capacity of 40MB in the company's literature.  

             Many theories have been offered about the cause of the 
        problems with the 20MB drive.  One is that the controller 
        leaks write current during reads, resulting in the slow 
        erasure of data.  But users have experienced no problems 
        using non-CMI drives on the AT.  The problem is actually 
        with the 20MB CMI drive.  The thermal stability of the case 
        is insufficient to maintain head alignment, resulting in all 
        sorts of havoc, as tracks get recorded and re-recorded at 
        different locations.  
          
             The 33MB drive is of a completely different design, 







FIDONEWS     --           01 Apr 85  01:35:59           Page 7

        which avoids the thermal problems of the 20MB drive.  The 
        other difference is that the 33MB drive is (currently) made 
        in the U.S., while the 20MB drive is made in the orient.

        MIKE HAMILTON       SYSOP FIDO #313 & 370

        I'm sure that all Rainbow owners have found as I have that 
        there is a bottleneck in system recovery between programs.  
        This is generally caused by having to reread COMMAND.COM 
        from the disk. Following is the procedure I use for moving 
        COMMAND.COM into memory in a RAMDISK.  

        Two programs are used RAMDISK and COMSPEC, both of which are 
        avaliable on numerous boards around the country.  

        In CONFIG.SYS add the following:

           RAMDISK.SYS 21K    (This will create a ramdisk of 21k in 
                                size) 

        In AUTOEXEC.BAT add the following (G: is used for reference 
                                           only the real drive will 
                                           be the next one 
                                           avaliable) 

        COPY COMMAND.COM G:
        SET COMSPEC=G:\COMMAND.COM

        I have several scare stories lately about using reinforced 
        center floppies. In my company we have over 100 RAINBOWS and 
        use exclusively DYSAN disks (they have a re-inforced center) 
        to the tune of 1000 per quarter for the past 6-9 months. We 
        have experienced no problems excpet with people who insist 
        in jerking the disks out of the machine when there is a 
        little resistance to removal.  

        I don't know where the information got started but it sounds 
        like the NY Times article about DEC and their RAINBOWS.  

        Anyone else have any experience that can be documented about 
        the ???problem???.

        Article from Kent Leonard
        Fido #77, Boulder, CO.

             First of all thanks to Tom Jennings for all the 
        Newsletters until now, and thanks to Thom Henderson 
        for his accepting the editorship of the Newsletter.

             I hope that everyone has heard all about the
        dismissal of the Tom Tcimpidis vs PacTel case.
        What is still very unclear to me is just what 
        should be the lessons learned by this case, and
        what practical actions should Sysops take as a
        result?  

             I am seeing many boards become a registration/
        subscription system, i.e. first time in, you only 
        get to leave your name address and phone number.
        The Sysop will then allegedly verify your information
        before allowing real access.  I for one am not 
        willing to undertake that kind of overhead to keep
        a Board running, and I really fail to see its
        value in protecting oneself against legal liability
        from abusive users.  

             I would appreciate comments from anyone in this
        matter, privately or in this newsletter.  THANKS.

             I might relate one or two interesting comments
        that I heard regarding this case:  The first was 
        from a lawyer who was incredulous when told about it.
        Ever since the Greeks has a public posting been 
        considered Free Speach and the property owner could
        not possibly be held liable.  He thought the case
        would collapse immediately upon submittal to any court.
        The second comment I got was "What if I go over to the
        Kiosks on the Mall and start posting Credit Card numbers?
        Will the city be held liable?  The merchant who owns the
        store that it's in front of?  How about the bulletin
        board that's in the local supermarket?"  Food for
        thought.

        ------------------------------------------------------------
        We have a confession to make.  We've been holding out on 
        you.  For several years now we've been using a program 
        called MACRO to boost our productivity.  But we've been 
        keeping it a closely guarded secret.  Even our most intimate 
        clients have been unaware of it's existence.  Now, however, 
        we've decided to release it to the PC user community.  

        If you have ever used a macro assembler, then you already 
        know how useful macros can be.  For the rest of you, well, a 
        good macro processor can do half of your work for you.  
        MACRO works with any normal text file, and hence can be used 
        as a powerful front-end to almost any language.  MACRO can 
        help you create programs that: 

        1.  Put parameters in your programs, allowing you to easily 
            change table sizes, ranges of values, and so forth.  

        2.  Put conditional code in your programs, allowing you to 
            write one program, and then "switch" parts on and off 
            easily for different customers and applications.  

        3.  Perform integer arithmetic and string manipulation 
            before your program is compiled, saving run time.  

        4.  Write programs that customize themselves when you 
            compile them, based on commands given and questions 
            answered during the macro scan.  

        MACRO is available for only $100 through SEAboard, Fido 375.  
        You can order by either leaving a comment to the sysop when 
        you log off of SEAboard, or by sending a PRIVATE message to 
        the sysop of Fido 375.  Be sure to give your name, mailing 
        address, and VISA or MasterCard number and expiration date.  

        Also be sure to download our electronic catalog, which will 
        run on any IBM PC, XT, or AT, and which gives details of our 
        complete line of products for the IBM user.

        Seems like everyone and their cousins are in the chip 
        selling business these days. So I figured Mike why don't you 
        join the crowd. Since I frequently listen to myself here is 
        the deal.  

        9 chip set of 256k chips for $125.
        3 sets for $115 apeice
        5 sets for $105 apiece
        larger orders call for prices.

        I realise that these prices are below what others are 
        offering. I have no excuse for them. My prices will come 
        down as the market drops its prices.  

        Contact me at fido #313 for arrangements.

             Does anyone know of any utilities for converting RBBS
        user lists to Fido user lists?  I understand the reluctance
        of some sysops to convert their RBBS systems to Fido just
        because of this one task.  Thanks.
