                                 NEC SCHMEC


        The NEC v20 and v30 chips  certainly  seem  to  have  hit  a 
        responsive  cord.  I  guess  there's  a lot of appeal to the 
        idea of boosting the speed of your computer for only  a  few 
        dollars.  

        I  can  well understand it.  When I first started working on 
        the PC I found it annoying that system response time  didn't 
        get  any  better  after five o'clock.  A salesman for one of 
        our clients would claim that a major advantage of using a PC 
        was  "consistent  performance".   Our  usual  response  was, 
        "Yeah, consistently bad." 

        These  days  I just suffer along,  and keep a book handy for 
        those long  compiles.  It's  still  nothing  like  having  a 
        Honeywell  6640 at your beck and call,  but I've gotten used 
        to it.

        Oh,  it's not all bad,  by any means.  At least I own my own 
        hardware now.  I no longer have to worry about moving all my 
        stuff  every  time  I  change  clients.  Still,  it could be 
        faster.  

        By all appearances I'm not the only one who feels that  way.  
        There  certainly seems to be quite a market for "accelerator 
        boards".  Greater speed also seems to  be  the  main  reason 
        people want AT's.  And now all this fuss over the NEC chip.  

        It's  understandable.  An old maxim among programmers states 
        that "there's no  such  thing  as  enough."  Everybody  will 
        always want more speed,  more memory,  more disk space.  Any 
        time you put a limit on  anything,  someone  will  hit  that 
        limit and complain about it.  

        A  side note and example:  We once worked on a project where 
        there was supposed to be an  exceptions  table.  The  client 
        said  to  allow  room  for ten exceptions,  since he'd never 
        really need more than three or four,  but wanted to play  it 
        safe.  We nodded our heads,  and made room for a hundred.  A 
        year later we were called back to expand  the  size  of  the 
        table.  

        As for the NEC chip,  there seems to be some disagreement on 
        how well it really works.  I'll let you read the reports and 
        decide for yourself.  I also hear that Intel is  suing  NEC, 
        claiming  that it's a straight copy of the 8088.  If this is 
        true,  then how could it be faster?  Not being a  lawyer,  I 
        don't  know.  I  find  it amusing,  though.  You see,  a few 
        years back Datapoint was suing Intel, claiming that the 8008 
        was a straight copy of a Datapoint machine -- the exact same 
        logic circuitry,  just etched on a single chip.  (I've since 
        heard it rumoured that they settled out of court.) 

        People will always want more,  and vendors will always claim 
        to give it.  There will always be a faster machine, a bigger 
        disk,  and so forth.  As my partner keeps reminding  me,  if 
        you don't want your equipment to become obsolete in a month, 
        you're in the wrong business.

                          THE COMPUTER UNDERGROUND
                           pre-publication preview


        This is a pre-publication, and off-the-wall review of the 
        the hottest and most realistic treatment of computer crime 
        (mainly getting unauthorized mainframe access) I've seen.  

        Not only do they have the logic of how to do it, they have 
        sample program listings!!!.  Most stuff came from pirate BBS 
        systems.  

        COMPUTER UNDERGROUND has stuff on ARPANET, MILNET, VAXs, 
        IBMs, Telenet, Tymnet and even a program listing for how to 
        crack Dialog passwords!  

        Most folks running mainframes say it can't happen to them.  

        COMPUTER UNDERGROUND shows it can not only happen to them, 
        as portrayed on TV, but shows how incredibly simple it is 
        because of sysop stupidity/laziness.  

        Even the government should read this book and give it to the 
        FBI as part of its training on busting crashers and data 
        pirates.  The book exposes some of the weakest links in 
        datacom security at major corporations.  

        This book is from the same publisher who brought you how to 
        get a new identity, how to make bombs in your kitchen, etc.  

        Send for information to the publisher:

        If you think this book is as dangerous and revealing as I 
        think it is, you'll get your friends to read it and upgrade 
        their mainframe systems.  

        Get ahold of Computer Underground and show folks what is 
        really going on.  

                         Please pass on this notice.

                                Kurt Reisler
                         SYSOP FIDO 109/74 & 109/483

                Recently I have been receiving a lot of inqueries 
        about where to obtain copies of the latest version of FIDO.  
        Although I maintain both the DEC Rainbow and the IBM PC 
        versions for downloading on FIDO 109/483 (Wash-A-RUG), and I 
        know that they are also available on FIDO 100/22, 101/27 and 
        125/1 (of course), I would like to be able to direct these 
        individuals to the nearest "distribution" nodes.  

                So, I would like to propose the following.  I would 
        like to build a list of "distribution" nodes, their 
        locations, phone numbers, and versions of FIDO that the 
        maintain (ie DEC, IBM, SANYO, etc.). Those of you who are 
        maintaining FIDO distributions on line, please let me know 
        via FIDOMAIL, and I will compile all of this information 
        into a list which can be published in the FIDONEWS, as well 
        as distributed via UUCP/USENET to the rest of the world.  

                So, please send the requested information to me 
        (SYSOP) at FIDO 109/74 (The Bear's Den), and I will get 
        started compiling this FIDO distribution list.  

                Thanks - Kurt

           *** MORE REGARDING THE NEC V20 MICROPROCESSOR CHIP ***

        Downloaded from another Chicago BBS system

        The  following note appeared recently on USENet (net.micro).  
        It  seems to be the best summary so far of the NEC V20/30  - 
        iAPX86/88 controversy. I'm posting it in it's entirety: 
         
        From: tweten@AMES-NAS.ARPA (Dave Tweten)
        Subject: Re: NEC V20 ---> 8088
        Date-Received: 16 Sep 85 08:45:42 GMT
         
        I recently bought an NEC V20 and installed it in my Z-151, 
        which I am using to write this message.  When I pried the 
        8088 out from next to my 8087, I noticed that it too had 
        been a NEC part.  Contrary to earlier comments in this forum 
        about NEC 8088s not working with 8087s, it had worked 
        flawlessly with my 8087 for the previous year.  
         
        Preliminary experience is that the V20 speeds up some 
        programs noticably, and has no effect on others.  That is to 
        be expected.  If a program is 8087 limited or I/O limited, 
        speeding up the 8088 will do no good.  It has worked at 
        least as well as the 8088 for any program I have tried.  
         
        The only "negative" effect of the V20 is it causes Zenith's 
        disk-based diagnostics for CPU-board crystal frequency, and 
        for floppy-disk driver crystal frequency to fail.  I presume 
        the tests compare crystal cycles against a wait-loop 
        counter.  Since the NEC V20 "waits faster" the tests fail.  
        Sorry, no time yet to do benchmarks.  
         
                From: Charles R. LaBrec <crl@Newton.Purdue.EDU>
         
        I haven't really heard many specifics of the NEC V20.  Is it 
        really a case of design stealing or just a case of 
        duplicating the 8088 instruction set?  Would someone care to 
        enlighten me?  
         
        I don't presume to be an engineering law expert, but by no 
        strech of my imagination can I conceive to the V20 being an 
        8088 carbon copy, either legal or illegal.  The following 
        information was gleened from Intel's "iAPX 88 BOOK" and from 
        the NEC document titled "V20, uPD70108, HIGH-PERFORMANCE 16-
        BIT MICROPROCESSOR, PRELIMINARY INFORMATION", dated May 
        1985.  
         
           The time for a register-to-register ADD is quoted as 
        three clocks for the 8088, two clocks for the V20.  NEC's 
        literature claims that is due to dual 16-bit on-chip busses 
        for the V20, as opposed to a single bus in the 8088.  That 
        supposedly permits two-cycle register-register instructions 
        (get both operands, return result), where the 8088 uses 
        three (get one operand, get the other, return the result).  







FIDONEWS     --           07 Oct 85  03:02:52           Page 6

        A quick scan through the respective instruction timing 
        charts indicates that the relationship holds for all trivial 
        two-register instructions (this obviously doesn't apply to 
        multiply and divide).  
         
           Intel's register-register 16-bit operand, 32-bit result 
        multiply is quoted at 118-113 clocks.  NEC's is quoted as 
        41-47.  The equivalent divide times are 165-184 cycles for 
        Intel and 38-43 for NEC.  Yes, I too noticed that NEC claims 
        to divide faster than they multiply, and I can't explain it 
        either.  
         
           NEC claims to use a separate address resolution unit on 
        the chip, instead of using the arithmetic unit.  Their 
        effective address calculation time is two cycles for any 
        mode.  Intel's ranges from 5 to 12, depending on mode.  
         
           The NEC chip has an expanded instruction set.  By my 
        estimation, it includes all the 80186 set plus several more.  
        It has bit-field insert and extract (perhaps useful in low 
        level graphics?).  It can test and manipulate individual 
        bits in memory.  It has packed decimal string add, subtract 
        and compare.  It has a BCD digit rotate instruction.  Those 
        are the highlights (as I see them); there are several more 
        instructions I haven't mentioned.  There is also a complete 
        8080 emulation mode which interests me not at all.  
         
        In summary, it appears to me that if the V20 is a "pirate" 
        8088, then the Z-80 was a "pirate" 8080.  Is our chauvinism 
        showing?

        NEC V20 CPU chip
        Triple 8088 speed.

        The NEC V20 CPU chip is an 8088 CPU chip replacement.  Speed 
        improvements of 10-40% have been claimed for the chip.  

        It may be that these percentage increases in speed 
        understate the actual improvement attributable to the chip 
        alone, since they may include disk operations or other 
        operations that are not CPU-intensive.  

        The program CPU.COM tests the speed of a CPU with minimal 
        RAM access and no disk I/O.  The speed of the CPU is almost 
        TRIPLE the speed of the native Intel 8088:

        Execution time should be 10.00 secs if 4.77 Mhz clock & no 
        WAITs on RAM access
        Actual execution time here was 03.35 seconds

        C>
        -------------------

        The above effective clock speed of ">.23 Mhz" is 14.23 Mhz.  
        Evidentally the program CPU.COM did not anticipate double-
        digit clock rates.

        The above test was performed on an IBM Portable PC.

        This chip can be purchased from JDR Microdevices for about 
        $20.  See a recent issue of Byte for their ad.

        NEC V20 CPU chip - Pfaster286
        Incompatible with Pfaster286 board.









FIDONEWS     --           07 Oct 85  03:02:55           Page 8

        According to a telcon with Phoenix Software Associates, the 
        NEC V20 chip is incompatible with their Pfaster286 
        coprocessor board.  

        The Pfaster286 software uses the PUSHA (Push All) 
        instruction to determine if the chip in use is the 80286 or 
        the 8088.  The 8088 gives an error if this instruction is 
        attempted.  But the NEC V20 has implemented this instruction 
        (80186 instruction set) and gives no error.  A revision to 
        the software (or hardware?) will be coming Real Soon Now.  

        Zider Brothers, San Francisco.

        -------------------------------------------------------------

        Just thought I'd add some further wood onto the fire 
        regarding the NEC V20.  Although I do not support the issue 
        of hardware piracy, if the information above regarding 
        instruction set and architecture is correct, I must admit 
        that I too fail to see how one could claim it as a copy.  
        Instruction set compatability has been around since the 
        System 360 series came out.  

        Also, regarding the issue of selling below cost as a method 
        of attempting to destroy competitors was discussed in the 
        last issue.  Although I can't prove that it applies in this 
        case, Japanese firms tend to make decisions based on long 
        term planning.  Although any chip is expensive while a firm 
        is "ramping up", the cost is driven down by high demand and 
        improvements which cause higher yields.  American history in 
        chip building bears this out.  Zilog introduced the Z-80 
        series at about a tenth of the Intel product cost and 
        managed to survive over the long run.  

        Although I'm not trying to create a war, I would really like 
        to find out the straight story from someone who is more of a 
        student of MPU architecture and associated micro-code 
        regarding the issue of whether the V20 is an illegal copy or 
        not. Please feel free to enter any and all rebuttals in this 
        forum or on Node 115/333 directly (312-397-6888) or via 
        Fidomail.

                        PRIVATE or PUBLIC
                        An ongoing debate
                        by Karl Schinke, 
                        (sysop of The Wizards Tower, 107/16)

            There has been a debate here at The Wizard's Tower,  and 
        on  other  boards,  Fido  and non-Fido,  as to whether to be 
        public, private, semi-private or whatever.  
            The question is this:  we as Sysops of  our  boards  are 
        responsible,  and  may  in  fact be legally liable,  for the 
        content of our boards.  
            As much as we may desparage the current legal  thinking, 
        it  seems  real  enough that we have some obligation to keep 
        our boards legal.  
            The problem,  of course,  is that there is no known  way 
        for a program to sieve the messages and files on a board for 
        their  content,  to  determine  if  they  represent  "shady" 
        activities,  so the  Sysop  must  manually  scan  the  stuff 
        periodically.  
            But  even  then,  what do you do?  You kill the message, 
        remove the file,  etc.  but by then,  damage may  have  been 
        done,  and you, dear sysop, have been unwitting accessory to 
        whatever. And what recourse do you have?  
            I  spoke  to  my  lawyer  when  I started the board.  He 
        suggested posting a disclaimer  (which  we  did)  and  close 
        scrutiny  (which  we  do),  but  didn't think the disclaimer 
        would actually hold up in court, if it came to that.  
            We here at "The Tower" do not have a terrific answer  to 
        share  with  you,  but a policy which has (so far) seemed to 
        work: we register our users.  
            We don't care what username people log in with,  thereby 
        preserving  anonymity from other users,  but we require that 
        users register their real names,  addresses,  and vox  phone 
        numbers with us before they may download or leave messages.  
            The questionnaire explains the policy,  and promises not 
        to  use the information (sell a mailing list) or disclose it 
        to other users.  
            Unregistered  users  may read public messages,  list the 
        files directory, etc...  basically snoop around,  and decide 
        whether they like the place before registering.  
            Initially,  this was all we did.  But we determined,  by 
        spot-checks,  that some users were lying- gave non- existant 
        addresses,  phone  numbers  of  people  who  didn't  know  a 
        computer   from   a   cigarette   machine,   and  so  forth.  
        Consequently,  we  altered  our  policy  to  a  verification 
        scheme, we call registrants by voice phone.  
            The  premise,  of course,  is that if anyone misbehaves, 
        we've "got their number" and can point the fickle finger.  
            So far, all our users have been well behaved. Of course, 
        since the vast majority of BBS'ers are honest,  well behaved 
        people,  they  may have been anyway.  We can't actually tell 
        if we discouraged any "unwelcome guests".  
            A few one-time callers have left messages to sysop  with 
        scatological  or  otherwise disparaging comment,  but in the 
        main,  folks seem to go along with us.  The one problem,  of 
        course,  is  the  trouble we have of making those darn phone 
        calls!

                          Corporate Nets and Nodes

        As many of you realize, Fido has spread far beyond the 
        wildest imagination of any of the original planners whose 
        intent was to develop a hobbiest network. Fido and FidoNet 
        have caught the attention of many Fortune 500 Corporations.  
        Some are obvious from the nodelist and others are buried 
        under disquised names, some have 1000 series private nets 
        and others are out there doing their own thing.  

        Since the beginning of nodelist administration in St. Louis I 
        have attempted to keep records of the corporations that have 
        obtained Fido. We would like to share this list with our 
        users with the intent that perhaps we can obtain more 
        information for our database. If you have information on 
        these or other Fortune 500 Fido's that you would like to 
        pass on to 1/0 I would appreciate the data.  

        The list I currently have, which is not all verified, is as 
        follows: 

            3M
            Bendix
            Boeing

        Fido 125/1
        30 Sept 85

                     NEC 'V' Series Processors: A review


                I purchased a NEC V30 (the 8086 replacement; the V20 
        is the 8088 replacement) this past month, and was a bit 
        disappointed with the results I got.  

                The V20 is actually an 8088 pin compatible 80188 
        minus the onboard IO devices, and V30 ditto 8086. The 
        instructions marked "Enhanced" in the NEC documentation are 
        the new, Intel, 8018x instructions; the ones marked "Unique" 
        are unique to the NEC series. I have not compared clock 
        cycles V30 vs. 80186, etc, but I would bet they are the 
        same.  

                I was told of wondrous speed increases, though the 
        range was given as "5 - 80%", which of course means down in 
        the 5% range is what you get; this is of course what I 
        found.  

                I have a Multibuss based machine running an Intel 
        SBC86/12A processor card, which uses an 8086, and modified 
        to run at 7.3MHz. I run MSDOS 3.05 on it. I use it for all 
        my work, including compiling Fido, documentation, etc. I use 
        the Lattice compiler, which is a fine program though on the 
        slow side. I figured that if I could get a real life 20% 
        speed increase I'd be very happy.  

                It is not possible to do "seat of the pants" testing 
        with something like this; you have to set up SOME sort of 
        test.  I did all testing on an empirical basis.  I do not 
        use the Seive of Erasthenes, bubble sorts, or other arcane 
        things day to day.  I edit, compile, and other things like 
        most everyone else.  

                One thing I do not do is use spreadsheets or other 
        "math intensive" programs. The V series chips will NOT 
        necessarily speed up programs that use (or could use) the 
        8087 coprocessor. You will hear that the V series chips are 
        substantially faster doing "math" than the Intel parts.  
        This is absolutely true, however, you will rarely see the 
        advertised speed increases supposedly possible.  

                The reason for the less than advertised speed 
        increase is that even in a program such as a spreadsheet, 
        the number of non-math instructions (jumps, logical 
        operations, bit testing, register and stack manipulation, 
        etc) that any CPU does far outnumbers the math type 
        instructions (multiply and divide mostly).  Even if multiply 
        and divide took zero time, your programs would not take zero 
        minutes to execute.  

                This is not to say that there are not isolated

        incidents; this means that plugging in this chip, or any 
        other real or fictional device, will not get you monstrous 
        speed increases.  

                The tests I did are admittedly systems oriented 
        tasks, though they are very applicable to estimating the 
        performance you will get in normal, daily use. The tests are 
        as follows: 


        (a)     Fido Compile. This consisted of a Lattice compile of 
        a number of Fido BBS modules, ones that it was convenient 
        (and easily repeatable) to cause a recompile. (I use a MAKE 
        type system, and I need to fool it.) This test was the "all 
        around" test; Lattice seems to spend less than 1/4th its 
        time doing disk IO, mostly it seems to be "working" with the 
        program source in memory. Lattice is a predominantly compute 
        bound program.  

        (b)     LISTGEN NODELIST.256. This is definitely compute 
        bound; compiled BASIC string manipulation.  

        (c)     ZAPLOAD FIDO_FID.EXE F FOO.HEX . ZAPLOAD is a 
        program that generates Intel HEX format. (ASCII 
        representation of a file.) It should be IO bound, but is not 
        due to poor programming. (What can I say?) 

        (d)     SCAVENGE A: SCAVENGE reads all blocks of a disk and 
        maps out bad sectors. My A: is a 10 meg hard disk, an 
        extremely fast one. This is definitely IO bound, with very 
        optimal drivers. This is a "control" test, and should not 
        vary, since the speed of executions is limited by the disk 
        not the processor.  

        (e)     Assemble the Multibuss BIOS. The BIOS of my 
        Multibuss box is about 20 .ASM source files. MASM.EXE is 
        very definitely compute bound. (Which by the way is the 
        worst assembler anyone will ever see. It should be IO 
        bound!) 


                I performed these five tests first with the 8086 
        installed, then after replacing the 8086 with the V30. No 
        other changes were made. Timing was done by a special 
        program that keeps a millisecond counter that I use for 
        general benchmarking, and is highly accurate and repeatable.  
        here are the results: 

        TEST                    8086            V30     Change
        (a) Compile Fido BBS    43:10           40:53   5.5%
        (b) Listgen             04:23           04:08   6.0%
        (c) Zapload             08:36           08:42   -1.1%
        (d) Scavenge            04:14           04:14   0%
        (e) Assemble BIOS       05:23           05:07   5.2%


                The results are pretty clear, and are verifiable.

        SCAVENGE is SCAV23X.COM, LISTGEN is John Warren's program, 
        ZAPLOAD should be out there somewhere, Lattice and MASM you 
        can find.  

                I cannot account for the ZAPLOAD test.  It should 
        not have slowed down. It may be an anomaly.  

                Anyone who uses MASM knows that it is terribly slow, 
        and for some unknown reason compute bound. (An assembler?!) 
        It is written in Microsoft Pascal, so I guess that's it.  

                An 8087 will NOT speed up when using the V30/V20 
        series.  It runs at its own clock rate.

                      NEW FIDO SYSOP UTILITIES FOR YOU
                      ---=----=-----=---------=---=---

        I have written two pretty slick Fido SYSOP utilities that 
        can save you an enormous amount of time in maintaining your 
        system.  Come and get 'em!  

        SHUFFLE redirects files and their corresponding FILES.BBS 
        entries among download directories.  SHUFFLE also permits 
        rudimentary editing of file entries a la EDLIN, and will 
        incorporate "orphan" files into FILES.BBS.  I think SHUFFLE 
        is far superior to similar programs available elsewhere.  

        READQUES reads ANSWERS.BBS (or ANEWUSER.BBS if the bug in 
        Fido 11 is ever fixed), displays the caller's statistics 
        from USER.BBS along with the questionnaire responses, and 
        prompts the sysop to upgrade the caller's access or mark 
        that record for deletion.  Admitting new users to semi-
        private systems is now a breeze.  

        Both programs can be used either locally using ANSI.SYS or 
        remotely using ANSI/VT100/VT52 emulation.  This is key for 
        people like me who live far away from the Fidos they 
        maintain.  

        You can get SHUFFLE (v1.3) and READQUES (v1.1) by calling 
        the Met-Chem BBS at 203/281-7287 (2400/1200 baud).

            Con  Solo  finished  checking  the  various  control and

        lost  the  Bus Signals as they passed the terminator.  As he

        collar when he was losing at chess.  In fact, RS232 had just 
        executed a particularly clever  MOV  that  had  blocked  the 
        Bookie's  data paths.  The Bookie,  who had been setting the 
        odds on the game,  was  caught  holding  all  the  cards.  A 
        little strange for a chess game...  

            Across the room,  Luke was too busy practicing bit-slice 
        technique to notice the commotion.  

            "On a word boundary, Luke," said PDP-1. "Don't just hack 
        at it.  Remember, the Bytesaber is the weapon of the Red-eye 
        Night.  It is used to trim offensive lines of  code.  Excess 
        handwaving won't get you anywhere.  Listen for the Carrier." 

            Luke turned back to the drone, which was humming quietly 
        in   the   air  next  to  him.   This  time  Luke's  actions 
        complemented the drone's attacks perfectly.  

            Con  Solo,  being  an  unimaginative  hacker,   was  not 
        impressed.  "Forget  this bit-slicing stuff.  Give me a good 
        PROM blaster any day." 

            "~~j~~hhji~~," Said Kenobie,  with no clear  inflection.  
        He fell silent for a moment, and reasserted his control.  

            "What happened?" asked Luke 

            "Strange," said PDP-1. "I felt a momentary glitch in the

        carrier.  It's equalized now." 

            "We're  coming  up  on user space," called Solo from the 
        CSR.  As they cruised safely thru stack frames, they emerged 
        in the new context only to be bombarded by freeblocks." 

            "What the..." gasped Solo.  The screen  showed  clearly: 
        /usr/alderaan:  not  found  "It's the right inode,  but it's 
        been cleared!  Twoie, where's the nearest file?" 

            "3 to 5 there's one..." The Bookie started to  say,  but 
        was interrupted by a bright flash off to the left.  

            "Imperial  TTY  fighters!" Shouted Solo.  "A whole DZ of 
        them!  Where are they coming from?" 

            "Can't be far from the host system," said Kenobie. "They 
        all have direct EIA connections." 

            As Solo began to give chase,  the ship lurched suddenly. 
        Luke noticed the link count was at 3 and climbing rapidly.  

            "This  is  no regular file," murmered Kenobie.  "Look at 
        the ODS directory structure ahead!  They seem to have  in  a 
        tractor beam." 

            "There's no way we'll unlink in time," Said Solo. "We're 
        going in..."
