     =================================================================

     This week's guest editorial is by Steve Jordan, 102/2871.

                   Editor Unleashed??  Author Unleashed!!

     I have "bit my tongue" also.  What  IFNA  and  FidoNet  needs  is
     leadership.  What  I  am  about to say may banish me to freeze in
     some remote place in California.  I  may  be  isolated  from  all
     FidoNet.  Actually,  I  don't  have  much  to  lose  because I am
     already there. (Lompoc_CA < paradise)

     I wrote an original version of the bylaws.  I decided that  there
     was enough bitching, and that I should do something.  That was to
     be a contribuiton.  I surmised that the people in charge were too
     busy  to do any thing positve.  I was "volunteered" as a co-chair
     of  the  (in)famous  bylaws  committee.  I  was  in  Nashua,  NH.
     (Nashua_NH_Nov  <  paradise)  My bylaws were correctly discarded.
     The present bylaws are flawed.  I must  take  exception  to  your
     exceptions. (This is at the risk of being redundant and repeating
     myself.  Is this redundant recursion or recursive redundancy??)

     TOO MANY DIRECTORS??- yes.  We TRIED to change that.  That is the
     biggest  flaw of the present bylaws.  Those twenty should vote to
     reduce their own numbers.  But that is unlikely.  A mistake  that
     we may have to live with.

     OVER  ORGANIZED-  Yes,   it  does  appear  that  IFNA  is  "over"
     organized.  We hoped that more than 200 would  join.  We  dreamed
     that  2,000  would  join.  If 2,000 or 10,000 join,  we will need
     more organization.  Any bylaws should be room for  expansion.  If
     we  did  not want expansion,  we should have kept the nodelist at
     800,  80,  or 8 (depending on when YOU joined.) This  process  is
     much too painful to be done yearly. 20 directors are TOO many.  I
     agree  and  have  fought  for  a  more  reasonable  11.  It was a
     compromise so that we could go on with our life.  I among  others
     had hoped to fix it prior to "release."

     NAMES-  Yes,  we  do  have  a "Board of Directors." Why???  Easy.
     That is how the rest of  the  world  does  it.  When  talking  to
     potential  members and IRS,  it is nice to have a common point of
     reference.

     Does the world need a new set of names  for  officers?  No.  Does
     the  world  need  another  PC  keyboard?  Let  me see.  YOU could
     reconfigure the keyboard in your programs.  Maybe in  SEAdog  5.0
     when  a user hit ALT-H will he get:  "Help,  you don't need help.
     Help is for wimps.  Type ALT-W (for wimp) if you feel you NEED it
     and cannot read the docs."

     Is IFNA the only organization that we  need?  Is  there  a  world
     beyond Fido? (Now that is an interesting question...)

     FUN- Yes, we need to have fun.  Accomplishment is fun.  Doing the
     Fidonews                     Page 3                    6 Apr 1987


     impossible  is  an incredible experience.  Sarcasm is fun.  Funny
     names are funny names.

     The officers of Capitol PC group enjoy attacking Lotus and Ashton
     Tate.  That is fun, too.

     MAJOR point.  The biggest problem  facing  IFNA  and  FidoNet  is
     attracting people who can work and can lead!!!  The present Board
     of Directors do not have enough time,  energy, money, nor SUPPORT
     to do the job.  Non-profit organization run  on  the  volunteered
     time  of  many.  Those  volunteers  will make mistakes and "flake
     out." They also will put in incredible efforts.

     Our job is to  attract  those  people.  Titles  help.  Committees
     help.  Recognition  helps.  We  need  an organization ladder that
     others can climb .

     People  want  change  and  growth.  That  is  the  attraction  of
     FidoNet.    People   want   recognition.   That   is   why   many
     organizations have a new president EVERY year.  One year  in  the
     limelight  for  5  or  10 years of work is not a bad trade.  Some
     people like to build their resumes with impressive titles.  I own
     my own company.  A title means nothing  to  me,  but  others  are
     different.

     Your  criticism  are  well  founded,   but  a  little  misguided.
     Politics is the art of compromise.  Programming  is  the  art  of
     perfection.  IFNA  is  now  in the realm of the politicians (good
     AND bad).  We have a set of bylaws.  Now the job is get  them  to
     work  long  enough  to  FIX  them.  As  I  stated  in  the bylaws
     committee, if we adopt those bylaws with ammendments,  we will be
     condemmed to fight these battles for another year (at least).

     Warts and all, we have bylaws.  We have policy.  I guess our next
     convention  will  spend  a  lot  of  time  discussing  bylaws and
     election of officers.

        CROBOTS Tournament Software - Run a tournament on your BBS!
                              By Robert Heller

     Hello,  I am Robert Heller and I am the SysOp of  a  BBS  in  the
     small  town of Wendell,  Mass.  I run as part of my BBS a CROBOTS
     tournament.  CROBOTS is a "game" written  by  Tom  Poindexter  of
     Bloomington,  IL.  It  is a subset C compiler and virtual machine
     emulator of sorts.  It has a 1000  meter  square  battlefield  in
     which  two to four robots battle it out.  Unlike the usual arcade
     game,  the robots are not controlled  by  joysticks  or  paddles.
     Instead  the  players write a C program that is the embodiment of
     the playing stratagy.  The C program(s) are compiled  and  loaded
     into the robots and the robots then fight.

     On my BBS I have a file area set aside for people to upload robot
     programs.  I  enter  these  programs  into  a  database and run a
     program which generates a tournament: it pits the robots in pairs
     against each other and  processes  the  match  results.  It  also
     generates  commentary  on the matches - sort of like the blow-by-
     blow of a sports writer.  It uses a function  I  translated  from
     SNOBOL4  to  C  to  generate  "random"  English text.  Here is an
     excerpt from such a commentery:

     Match set 1
         These hw class matches feature scan.r vs.  hxk.r.  scan.r was
     written  by Randy MacLean,  who describes it as "Scanning Robot".
     scan.r has appeared in 105 matches,  winning 89 of  them  with  6
     ties.  hxk.r  was  written  by  John Hardin,  who describes it as
     "Hunter-Killer".  hxk.r has appeared in 63 matches, winning 28 of
     them with 1 ties.

     Round 1: After 10260 cycles, scan.r has suffered 100% dammage and
     hxk.r has  suffered  96%  dammage.  hxk.r  zeros  scan.r,  1-zip.
     hxk.r's strategys were cunning!

     Round 2:  After 14085 cycles, scan.r has suffered 17% dammage and
     hxk.r has suffered 100% dammage.  scan.r ties up the series at  1
     rounds each. scan.r's efforts were splendid!

     Round 3:  After 11760 cycles, scan.r has suffered 55% dammage and
     hxk.r has suffered 100% dammage.  scan.r edges by hxk.r  bringing
     the series to 2 to 1. scan.r's strategys were nifty!

     Round 4:  After 7575 cycles, scan.r has suffered 100% dammage and
     hxk.r has suffered 81% dammage.  hxk.r ties up the  series  at  2
     rounds each. hxk.r's strategys were very brilliant!

     Round 5:  After 11205 cycles, scan.r has suffered 58% dammage and
     hxk.r has suffered 100% dammage.  scan.r edges by hxk.r  bringing
     the series to 3 to 2. scan.r's performances were good!

     Round 6:  After 11310 cycles, scan.r has suffered 80% dammage and
     Fidonews                     Page 5                    6 Apr 1987


     hxk.r has suffered 100% dammage.  scan.r increases its lead  over
     hxk.r, 4 to 2. scan.r's plays were very slick!

     Round 7:  After 11340 cycles, scan.r has suffered 55% dammage and
     hxk.r has suffered 100% dammage. scan.r widens the gap over hxk.r
     5-2. scan.r's plays were cunning!

     scan.r wins the heat by 3, 5 to 2. scan.r's efforts were bright!

     ------(commentary continues)----

     The software to generate the matches and generate the  commentary
     is  all  coded  in  C and should be portable to almost any system
     with a C compiler.  I use David Betz's SDB for the  data  base  -
     this  can probably be easily adapted to use another C-callable DB
     system.  The program I use runs on my Stride 440  under  CP/M-68K
     1.2  and  makes  use of CP/M-68K chain to program BDOS function -
     the main C program generates a submit  (command  procedure  file)
     that  runs the CROBOTS program in match mode and then submits the
     generated file.  The last command  in  the  submit  file  runs  a
     second program which analyzes the results of the matches, updates
     the  DB,  generates  the  commentary and writes a new submit file
     (pits the winners of each match  against  each  other)  and  then
     chains  to  the new submit file.  The last command in this submit
     file also runs the second program.  When there is only one  robot
     left the program exits without chaining.

     CROBOTS itself is available on many BBS's as shareware - the free
     archive  contains  an executable and documentation and runs under
     MS-DOS.  Source code is available at for a small  fee  (I  bought
     the sources and adapted it to run under CP/M-68K).

     My  added code is available with complete sources.  Presently the
     three pieces (SDB,  Tourn,  and SNOBOL) are  on  GEnie  (SDB  and
     SNOBOL  (contains the random sentence generator and support code)
     in the CP/M Roundtable and Tourn in the BBS Roundtable).  I  have
     upload  some  of the code to some of the local Fidos.  If you are
     interested in getting this  software,  I  can  upload  the  three
     pieces  to  a  Fido  somewhere and mail it,  although some of the
     files are quite large, or put them on floppies (DEC Rainbow CP/M-
     80/86 (RX50 -  single-sided,  double-density,  96TPI)  format  or
     Sage/Stride  DSDD  96TPI CP/M-68K format).  Sorry,  I can't write
     MS-DOS format floppies.

     My system is not on FidoNet, but I can be reached at either Daves

                            ShareWare
                             Concept


     MINILIST.ARC Have you noticed nodes dropping off of your nodelist
                  and do not like to have to manually hack it up to
                  get mail to move? Fido can not handle over 1200
                  nodes. Well MINILIST solves this problem. It uses a
                  control file and creates a TINY nodelist for just
                  those nodes you wish to do mail with. This can
                  include a whole net or just individual nodes.  This
                  way you will be able to do mail with ALL nodes in
                  the nodelist without having to manually change it
                  and lose other nodes.  GREAT Tie over till FIDO v12
                  arrives.

     NODEKILL.COM Have you accidently generated many notes for one
                  node that you did not want to send to or is not on
                  the nodelist? Well this little utility will kill all
                  notes To or From a particular node. This gets rid of
                  that nasty, tedious note killing you hate.  VERY
                  HANDY! (For help type NODEKILL).

     ARCWIPE.COM  This nifty little utility gets rid of those stray
                  arcmail packets that waste space on your hard-drive.
                  Note killing and some programs do not kill the
                  associated packet.  With this program you set
                  parameters as to how many days old a note and packet
                  should be when they are to be deleted. Helps get rid
                  of having to sort through files.  VERY USEFUL! (For
                  help type ARCWIPE).

            EchoMail "Netiquette": An alternative to censorship.


     Karl Andrews has recently (FidoNews Vol. 4, No. 7, Feb. 16, 1987)
     proposed that the Echomail conferences be censored.  I found  his
     points  to be interesting,  and quite valid.  Echomail is growing
     rapidly, and is an excellent addition to Fidonet.  Along with the
     growth have come "abuses" unfortunately.  Most  of  these  abuses
     are (probably) unintentional, the result of new users not knowing
     better, or even old-time Fido users used to regular Fidomail.

     Censorship  may  be  a  bit of a draconian measure.  It imposes a
     burden on the Sysop,  because  every  message  must  be  screened
     before  going  out.  This  screening process could also slow down
     the entire process of getting echomail messages posted.  While  I
     agree  with Mr.  Andrews that there should be some censorship,  I
     believe it would be better that the "censorship" originate within
     the author of a posting,  as UseNet has been doing for some  time
     with most of its newsgroups.

     UseNet  may provide a good model for Echomail in many ways;  most
     of the newsgroups (roughly equivalent to Echomail areas) are open
     to postings from anyone with access to  UseNet  -  although  some
     self-imposed  restrictions  -  such  as  posting  to  the correct
     newsgroup(s) - are expected of those posting to  the  net.  Other
     newsgroups  are  moderated,  that  is  all  postings are sent not
     directly to the newgroups,  but to a central moderator,  a person
     (or persons working together) responsible for editing (censoring)
     the postings submitted.

     Echomail  could  follow a similar scheme;  areas for free posting
     and for moderated postings can co-exist.  Certain areas could  be
     moderated  by the Sysop of the Fido originating a posting,  other
     areas could be moderated by a volunteer  moderator  (perhaps  for
     each  net  or region - or zone?),  collated at some central node,
     and then re-dispersed.  Other areas would be as they are now - in
     that anyone could freely post to them.  The only difference  that
     I  would  like to see is that those posting understand Echomail a
     little more (especially vis-a-vis regular Fidomail) and  consider
     following some suggested guidelines.  (Ahh - we finally arrive at
     the main point of this submission....)

     Like Mr.  Andrew,  I would like to see Echomail cleaned up a bit.
     Right now,  I retain only about five days worth of TECH messages,
     which usually amounts to about 150-200 messages.  This takes up a
     *lot* of space on our  system,  but  *can*  be  very  worthwhile.
     However,  looking at the messages, I see too many that consist of
     a  header,  the  "seen-by"  lines,  and  a  single  message  line
     consisting  of  something like "I agree with Fred - but check the
     syntax anyway" or "Wow - it was great seeing  you  at  lunch  the
     other  day,  let's do it again." It is also exasperating to think
     that each of these takes up a minimum of  2K  on  my  hard  disk.
     Because  of  the  fact that Echomail messages often arrive out of
     sequence  (or  sometimes  never)  the  responses  to  queries  or
     Fidonews                     Page 10                   6 Apr 1987


     problems  can arrive before the query itself - or the query could
     have been removed from the message base weeks  before.  when  the
     response give no clue as to what the original problem was - e.g.,
     "Well,  disconnect pin 24 and then check DTR", I - and presumably
     others reading the messages on my system - can't benefit from the
     wisdom dispensed - and Echomail can be a *very*  valuable  source
     of information.

     UseNet apparently had similar problems (and still does - every so
     often,  a  less-than-circumspect  poster gets "flamed" on the net
     for his/her ill advised posting) so that someone wrote a document
     on Network Etiquette,  often referred to now as "Netiquette"  (my
     dog-eared  copy  indicates  the  author  is one "Chuq Von Rospach
     (nsc!chuqui)", with an apparent date of Sept. 1984 - although the
     actual document may be older).  What I want to do in the rest  of
     the article is to generate a clone of Netiquette intended for use
     by  Echomail users.  Don't consider these as a fascist imposition
     on the Fidonet/Echomail world.  I think of Netiquette as a set of
     very good suggestions;  I hope the following, modified to reflect
     differences  between  UseNet and Echomail,  will also be taken as
     suggestions.  Furthermore,  I  hope  that  they  are  used  as  a
     starting  point,  and  that  they will be refined and improved by
     Sysops and users.

     I'll start out with  the  "Summary  of  Things  to  Remember"  as
     presented at the end of the original Netiquette,  and follow that
     with an expansion of each point.

                            Expansion of Points
             "Never Forget the Person on the Other Side is Human"

     As pointed out in the Original Netiquette (O.N.  hereafter), your
     interaction  with the network is through Echomail and a computer,
     Fidonews                     Page 11                   6 Apr 1987


     and it is easy to forget that there are people  "out  there".  In
     fact, the O.N. is so clear on this, I can think of nothing better
     than to quote the remainder verbatim:

         "Please  remember  that people all over the world are reading
         your words.  Do not attack people if you cannot persuade them
         with your presentation of the facts.  Screaming, cursing, and
         abusing others only serves to make people think less  of  you
         and less willing to help you when you need it.

         If you are upset at something or someone, wait until you have
         had  a  chance  to  calm  down  and think about it.  A cup of
         coffee  or  a  good  night's  sleep  works  wonders  on  your
         perspective.  Hasty  words  create  more  problems  than they
         solve.  Try not to say anything to others you would  not  say
         to them in person in a room full of people."

                                 "Be Brief"
     Clear,  concise, succinct postings will have a much more powerful
     effect than a long  rambling  posting.  If  your  audience  isn't
     grabbed  by  the first screenful,  they will likely reach for the
     'n' key and skip the rest of the posting.  However,  don't cut so
     much that your posting looses its clarity.

             "Your Postings Reflect Upon You; Be Proud of Them"
     As stated in O.N., writing well is an art, and requires practice.
     Try to avoid grammar and even spelling errors;  you will be known
     to many people on Fidonet only through  your  Echomail  postings.
     You  know you're a nice person and intelligent to boot - let that
     come though in your postings.  You don't want  your  postings  to
     come back to haunt you.

                          "Use Descriptive Titles"
     Fido lets you enter a title, or subject line;  I believe that you
     have up to  72  characters.  Use  that  space  to  let  potential
     readers  know what your posting is about.  Don't ramble,  but get
     your point across;  the 72 characters area a fixed overhead -  72
     bytes  are  used,  whether or not you fill them with information.
     This subject line is probably more important for Echomail than it
     is for Fidomail.

                        "Think About Your Audience"
     When you post an article (submit a  message  to  Echomail)  think
     about  the audience you wish to reach.  The TECH area is hardly a
     place to post a joke;  you would not try to get a Pascal  problem
     answered   by  posting  the  questions  you  had  to  the  C_ECHO
     conference.  Similarly, it seems rather useless to place personal
     messages ("see y'all for lunch next Tuesday") in an Echomail area
     - it takes up space on many many systems,  and is (likely) of  no
     interest  to anyone on systems other than the originating system.
     If you're sending a message to a  friend  on  another  Fido,  use
     Fidomail  so  it  goes  to your friend;  Echomail broadcasts your
     message to all connected  systems.  Sysops  should  perhaps  make
     users aware that posting messages in Echomail areas results in an
     incredible propagation of that message. These (mostly accidental)
     bogus  postings  cause the Echomail system to degenerate;  if you
     Fidonews                     Page 12                   6 Apr 1987


     have to wade through 15 useless messages to get at one  gem,  you
     start to lose interest in bothering with reading Echomail at all.

                    "Be Careful with Humor and Sarcasm"
     Most  people  use  humor  in  their  day-to-day interactions with
     others.  But on the phone, or in person, you can see expressions,
     postures, etc., and pick up subtle voice inflections that tip you
     off to attempts at humor.  In the cold light of the video screen,
     these cues are lost,  and your humor may not be taken as humor  -
     and your readers will think you're a jerk,  and be offended, when
     all you intended to  do  is  display  your  magnificent  wit  and
     fantastic  sense  of  humor.  On  UseNet  people  often  signal a
     humorous remark with a "smiley face" - a ":-)" construction.  Try
     it - you may find that you amuse 97%  of  the  population  rather
     than  having  98% of the population taking out a contract on your
     life :-)

                         "Only Post a Message Once"
     Recently,  some poor (nameless) fellow deluged Echomail with  ads
     for   a   "headhunter"   service.   Not   only  was  the  message
     inappropriately posted (wrong area according  to  some  of  those
     flaming the guy),  but the guy was remarkably diligent in posting
     - I count 10-15 separate copies of his message (fairly long  too,
     compared  to  most  messages)  coming into my Echomail areas in 2
     days,  with a few more trickling in after  that.  Once  again,  I
     think  the  poster  didn't  realize the aggravation that he would
     cause,  and the extent of the hard feeling directed  toward  him.
     Remember, these messages cost sysops hard currency to send across
     the  phone  lines,  and take up space on there system,  and again
     massive multiple postings debilitate  the  Echomail  network.  If
     you  have  to  read  ten copies of the same message to get to one
     good message....

             "Please Rotate Messages with Questionable Content"
     This is a toughie for Echomail  users.  On  UseNet,  there  is  a
     facility that "rotates" text,  that is, performs a rough encoding
     of the message text - an 'A' becomes an 'N', an 'M' a 'Z', and so
     on.  The news/mail reading software incorporates the  ability  to
     rotate  the text on entry and upon reading,  if the user requests
     it.  We don't easily have this  facility  in  Echomail;  I  would
     think  that  those  of us who have a facility such as SuperKey or
     SideKick (PC & clones) or Doit (Rainbows) that allows us to paste
     the contents of a file onto the screen could  do  something  like
     this.  Perhaps we need to make available (on Fidos) software that
     does  the rotating,  so that messages can be prepared with a text
     editor (a good idea anyway - lets you  edit  and  correct  errors
     much easier),  then rotated, and pasted onto the screen while you
     are in the process of posting your message/article.  When reading
     mail,  you could  cut  the  text  from  the  screen  (again  with
     something  like  SideKick  or SuperKey),  save it in a file,  and
     rotate the text later.  This isn't just to protect delicate  ears
     (eyes?  :-)  )  from language that some might consider offensive;
     see the point about marking  or  rotating  answers  or  spoilers,
     later  in  this  document.  You might also consider indicating in
     the subject line that you have rotated some or all of the text of
     the message.

                   "Summarize What You are Following Up"
     Another one of my pet peeves about many Echomail postings, is the
     lack of reference to the original  query,  problem,  or  posting.
     Some  users of Echomail follow the UseNet convention of repeating
     the critical lines of the original,  with each line preceded by a
     '>'  symbol.   UseNet  actual  carries  this  further:   Postings
     referring to references in an earlier posting use  a  double  '>'
     (>>)  and  the  beginning of each line referenced by the previous
     posting.  I've noticed that the "Old Frog"  of  Rhinelander  Wis.
     (Ahh,  lovely  country  up  there - I've got relatives near Eagle
     River...), Gee Wong and others follow the UseNet convention,  and
     it makes reading their postings much easier.  As the O.N. said,

       > Even if you are responding to the entire article, summarize
       > only the major points you are discussing.

                       "When Summarizing, Summarize!"
     When  you  request  information on some topic from the members of
     the network, it is a common courtesy to summarize and report your
     finding to the net.  This way the information is  in  one  place,
     and everyone on the net can benefit.  Not everyone will have been
     able to get all responses to the original request,  and often the
     best way to respond to requests is via Fidomail rather  than  via
     Echomail.  When  summarizing,  take the time to edit the replies,
     strip mail headers and "seen-by" lines, and perhaps write a short
     summary.  If possible,  give credit to those who took the time to
     respond to your request for help.

                     "Use Mail, Don't Post a Follow-up"
     As  stated in O.N.:  " One of the biggest problems we have on the
     network is that when someone asks a question,  many  people  send
     out  identical  answers."  This  can really clog a network.  Give
     some thought before posting  an  answer  to  Echomail;  a  direct
     response via regular Fidomail to the person with the question may
     be the best route.  If you do choose the latter route,  you might
     suggest that the recipient summarize to Echomail.  Personally,  I
     think  there  is  a  fine  line  to  be  walked  here - it is not
     desirable to inhibit Echomail postings,  but we  don't  need  200
     people  all  responding  with  "on page 4-67 of the Dos Technical
     manual, it states...." either.  Thus the next point.

     "Read All Follow-ups and Don't Repeat What Has Already Been Said"
     From the O.N.:
         "Before you submit a follow-up to a message, read the rest of
         the messages in the newsgroup (Echomail area) to see  whether
         someone  has  already  said what you want to say.  If someone
         has, don't repeat it."

                 "Be Careful About Copyrights and Licenses"
     Again, directly from the O.N., with comments in square brackets:
         "Once something is posted onto the network, it is effectively
         in the public domain.  When posting material to  the  network
         keep  in  mind  that material that is UNIX-related [or PC|MS-
         DOS,  for example] may be restricted by the  license  you  or
         your  company  signed  with  AT&T  [Microsoft,  etc.]  and be
         careful not to violate it.  You should  also  be  aware  that
     Fidonews                     Page 14                   6 Apr 1987


         posting  movie  reviews,   song  lyrics,   or  anything  else
         published under a copyright could cause you, your company, or
         the net itself to be held liable for damages,  so  we  highly
         recommend caution in using this material."

     Occasionally  you see requests for copyrighted software "Yo Ernie
     - I need Dos 3.2 to do something that I  can't  with  2.11  -  ya
     wanna  send  a  copy to me - thanks,  Bert".  Even if the net was
     acquitted of any wrongdoing, legal fees, hassles, etc. take their
     toll.

                       "Cite Appropriate References"
     I can't say it better than the O.N.:
         "If you are using facts to support a cause,  state where they
         came  from.  Don't  take someone else's ideas and use them as
         your own.  You don't want someone pretending that your  ideas
         are theirs; show them the same respect."

                   "Mark or Rotate Answers of Spoilers"
     By answers,  we mean answers to jokes, etc.  By spoilers, we mean
     those sections  of  reviews  that  give  away  the  ending  (thus
     spoiling  the  movie  or  book for those who haven't yet seen the
     movie or read the book).  On UseNet,  you can rotate the text  as
     mentioned  earlier  in  this  document,   or  you  can  mark  it,
     indicating that the answer or spoiler will appear next;  you then
     structure  your  text  so  that  the  reader may avoid seeing the
     answer/spoiler by pressing 'n' the next time the "-more-?" prompt
     is issued.  In Echomail we would probably have to pad with  blank
     lines  (lines  with  one or two spaces and a carriage return/line
     feed sequence) to force the spoiler to  then  next  screenful.  I
     have  not  tried  stuffing  a  form  feed  into  the text of fido
     message, but that might also force a "-more-" message.  You might
     want to include mention of the fact that there is a  spoiler,  or
     that you have rotated the text in your subject line.

                   "Spelling Flames Considered Harmful"
     Once again, the text of the O.N. says it best:
         "Every  few  months  a  plague  descends on UseNet called the
         spelling flame.  It starts out when someone post  an  article
         correcting  the  spelling  or  grammar  in some article.  The
         immediate result seems to be for everyone on the net to  turn
         into  a  6th  grade  English  teacher  and  pick each other's
         postings apart for a few weeks.  this is not productive,  and
         tends  to cause people who used to be friends to get angry at
         each other.

         It is important to remember that we all  make  mistakes  [see
         point  #1,  remember that the other side is a human...],  and
         that there are many users on the next who use  English  as  a
         second language.  If you feel that you must make a comment on
         the  quality of a posting,  please do so by mail,  not on the
         network [i.e., not via Echomail]"

     Do refer to point #3 though,  and try to make your *own* postings
     as correct as possible.

                        "Don't Overdo Signatures"
     On  UNIX  systems  (home  of  UseNet)  you can have a "signature"
     appended automatically to the end of each of your  mail  messages
     or  net  postings.   These  typically  contain  disclaimers  "The
     opinions expressed are solely my own and do not reflect those  of
     my employer or any other sane individual - etc., etc.  " and mail
     pathways,  which tend to be rather convoluted  at  times  in  the
     UseNet.  However,  a signature that is longer than the message is
     of rather  dubious  taste.  This  is  true  on  UseNet,  and  (my
     opinion)  more  true in Echomail.  A one-line message preceded by
     5-6 lines of header, followed by a 10 line signature, followed by
     several lines of "seen-by" information still only gives me one or
     two useful lines.

     However (more personal opinion) I do believe that signatures have
     a place in Echomail.  In fact,  I'd like  to  see  a  very  short
     signature appear at the very beginning of the posting, giving the
     poster's  name,  net  and node.  This would make it *much* easier
     for people interested in communicating with the  poster  to  find
     the poster.  A UseNet style signature (tasteful and restrained if
     you  please!)  could  take it's place at the tail of the article.
     Why place a name,  net,  and node at the  top?  Occasionally,  an
     article  is  truncated in transit - the seen-by lines are usually
     there, but sometimes, a posting kind of dies in mid-sentence.

                      -----------------------------

                     The Ten Commandments for UseNet

     These "commandments" were appended to the  end  of  the  Original
     Netiquette  article  (which appears to have an alternate title of
     "A Primer on How to Work With the  USENET  Community").  I  think
     they're worth including here.

     I      The Net is special; treat it with respect.
     II     Always create a clear and concise subject line.
     III    Keep thy postings short and never ramble.
     IV     Always post to the proper news group.
     V      Never post the same thing twice; post once to multiple
            newsgroups or use short pointers where required.
     VI     Thou shalt spend 40 days and nights in meditation before
            adding or removing any newsgroup.
     VII    Specify clearly if and how thou expectest responses.
     VIII   Reply in person whenever possible and limit thy followups
            to truly worthy items.

     I've  got  to  extend  thanks  to  Karl Andrews (138/241) for his
     submission to FidoNews.  I had been thinking for some time  about
     writing  this  submission,  and  his  article  gave me the push I
     needed to actually do it.  I hope Mr.  Andrews  doesn't  take  as
     Fidonews                     Page 16                   6 Apr 1987


     much flaming for his suggestions as he expected to.

     In  closing,  while  I  agree with Mr.  Andrews about the need to
     clean up Echomail,  I would prefer to see the cleaning up done by
     those  posting  to  Echomail.  Sysops are still free to zap those
     messages they do not want,  to maintain an editorial  control  by
     the  use  of the 'k' key.  But it would be much easier to educate
     users as to their responsibility when  posting  to  Echomail  and
     trust  that most users are willing to exercise some self-control.
     At the same time,  it  would  be  nice  to  have  some  moderated
     echomail  conferences,  but  that  would  require  a considerable
     amount of organization and cooperation among sysops.  I hope that
     Fidonet sysops and users can work  out  a  more  viable  Echomail
     system,  as  (opinion  again!) Echomail is a powerful addition to
     Fidonet  and  Fidomail.   I  also  hope   that   this   article's
     suggestions  are  a  first  step  towards  an  even  more  useful
     Echomail.

                        Net 107 Phone Number Changes


     Network Coordinators:
     Members of Net 107:


     Due to a series  of  unexpected  problems  in  Net  107,  several
     systems'  phone  number have changed,  but these changes have NOT
     been included in the current NODELIST (NODELIST.093).

     The following is a list of systems in Net 107 which have  changed
     phone numbers.

         +--------------------------------------------------+
         |  Address  System     Telephone        Sysop      |
         |  -------  ------  --------------  -------------  |
         |  107/0    HOST    1-201-699-7799  Gee Wong       |

     To avoid the possibility haveing the Net choke to death with
     undelivered Net 107 traffic, please override  the  telephone
     numbers in NODELIST.093 with the numbers listed in the above
     table.

     Gee M Wong, 107/312

                     Formation of a new HUB in Net 107


     On Friday 10 April 1987,  half of the nodes in HUB  107/300  have
     been reassigned to a new HUB.  This new HUB is 107/500, and it is
     being coordinated by Marv Shelton.

     Many  of  the  reassigned  nodes  have  been  given  new  network
     addresses.   However,   the  former  network  addresses  will  be
     maintained  on  the NODELIST as duplicate entries until Friday 24
     April 1987,  to provide the network with a  two  week  transition
     period.

     During  the  transition period,  all affected Sysops should start
     making any  necessary  changes  to  their  network  tables  (i.e.
     ROUTE.DOG,  CONFIG.DOG,  MAIL.SYS,  AREAS.BBS),  and  to have all
     these changes completed before the end of the transition  period.
     Also,  Sysops  whose  systems have been reassigned to HUB 107/500
     may find it helpful to use their new  network  address  as  their
     primary  network address,  and their old network address as their
     secondary network address, during this transition period.

     The table below contains a list of nodes which will be reassigned
     to HUB 107/500.  Basicly,  all nodes in  northern  NJ  have  been
     reassigned to HUB 107/500,  and all nodes in central and southern
     NJ have been kept in HUB 107/300.

     For those Sysops in NJ,  if you  feel  that  you  have  not  been
     assigned to the correct HUB, please send a private message to Gee
     Wong at 107/300, 107/312, or 107/317 as soon as possible.

     Vince Perriello, 141/491

                             The IFNA Scorecard


     I just thought I'd share my opinions of most of  the  individuals
     and/or  topics  in the great International Fidonet Nuclear Attack
     (IFNA) squabbles of the last year (almost).  Maybe you'll  agree,
     maybe you'll disagree.  But for me, the healing will start when I
     get the poison out of the wounds.  So here we go.

     Let's start with IFNA itself.  It was the right thing to do.  Ken
     and  Ben  had to avoid liability for the contents of the nodelist
     (remember that's why the corporation was  created  in  the  first
     place!).  I  also  think  that  using  it  as  an  entity  to get
     concessions from manufacturers for members as  a  group,  and  to
     influence  committees  and  legislators,  made  so much sense I'm
     still dumbfounded at the way things turned out in Colorado.

     Colorado. Give the mob two points for muddying up the waters. But
     others were at fault too. Read on.

     The Bylaws. What do they mean?  I think what we have here is some
     kind of cosmic committment to save the world every other day, but
     not until we've gotten their permission to do so,  notarized,  by
     registered U.S. Snail. It's full of garbage that was put there to
     appease  people  who  weren't  going  to  be  happy  unless  they
     themselves were appointed Emperor. It will sink of its own weight
     unless fixed quickly by the elected BOD.

     Ken Kaplan and Ben Baker.  Too much silence. We should have heard
     their voices more.  Too much transpired  in  the  "early  phases"
     without  any  word  from  them.  It  contributed  to  the mess in
     Colorado.  People who would have  gladly  gone  along  with  IFNA
     properly  presented  instead  wound  up  among  the  Complainers,
     because they had a legitimate beef about  the  amount  of  things
     that  had  already been done without prior notification.  I might
     add that they never got more vocal, in SYSOP,  IFNA,  or anywhere
     else, and that that was even WORSE.

     Thom Henderson. He did his best. He did very well. Usually he was
     able  to respond with some semblance of a sense of humor.  But he
     was just as doomed as Bob Dole in 1976 (remember?  Gerry Ford had
     to  be  a  nice  guy so Dole got to be the "Hatchet Man"?  People
     still remember and dislike him for  the  energetic  way  that  he
     carried  out  his  mandate).  Too  bad.  While his orientation in
     almost any situation I've seen him in thus far  is  slightly  too
     commercial for my taste, he has a good head on his shoulders, and
     he  really  CARES  about  what's  coming  down.  And  he puts the
     commercialism aside when the situation clearly calls for that.

     The Secret Modem Committee.  I can't hold anyone responsible  for
     not  communicating  what they did yesterday while they were still
     catching up on their sleep.  My  synapses  don't  work  too  well
     either under those circumstances.

     Here's some more opinions of the key players and entities. Again,
     these are my opinions,  certainly not those of the management.  I
     didn't even ASK my wife! :-)

     Bob Hartman. Basically nice guy. Very intelligent.  He never knew
     what hit him.  I think he's almost recovered now.  Good thing. He
     writes good software for the community.  Some of us even  PAY  to
     use it.

     Thomas  Gentry.  In retrospect I think he was trying to make some
     kind of clever statement that was not exactly  in  favor  of  the
     IFNA nodelist copyright.  It wasn't that clever.  And he got more
     FLAMES than he probably deserved (assuming that I'm  right  about
     the "statement").

     Ken Shackelford.  He loves FLAMING like Ron loves zapping Rooskie
     missiles.  He had a lot of important inputs,  but sometimes I had
     the  feeling  he  was  saying things just to see how people would
     react. At times that was a RIOT.  Other times I didn't like it as
     much. But he has a good heart.  And he'll make a good BOD member,
     especially  since  he  has the biggest flame thrower this side of
     the Volga.

     Tracy Graves.  For me, the most significant thing about Tracy was
     that I could not,  for the longest time, determine gender.  Tracy
     LIVES the gender neutral mind that certain others only wish  for.
     But  I  digress.  Tracy is a reasonable intelligent man who still
     hasn't woke up and smelled the coffee.  But there's always  hope.
     Sometimes  the  most  profound  intellectual  struggle  is within
     yourself. I'm rooting for him.

     Adam (to paraphrase John Lennon,"You know my number,  look up  my
     name")  Selene.  and  for  that matter Gillian Boardman.  I still
     don't know what gender neutrality had to do with IFNA.  But  I'll
     defend  to  the  death their right to share their own feelings in
     the matter. "Adam" was extremely vocal in IFNA. That's worth some
     recognition.  And recently it sounds like "Adam" is going  to  do
     what  he can to help clean up the mess (see my earlier comment on
     the by-laws). Good.

     Randy Bush.  Good head.  Was that  a  TANTRUM  I  saw  him  throw
     recently?  Well,  the  rest of us own balls too.  Take yours home
     with you. We'll survive. Wish you didn't operate that way. I wish
     you luck.

     Wynn Wagner.  The complainers think he's anti IFNA.  Wrong.  He's
     not  pro  or  anti ANYTHING.  He's no more in "your camp" than in
     "theirs".  He's writing a good BBS program.  Rumor has it that it
     costs a lot less than TBBS.  And that unlike TBBS it doesn't need
     SEAdog  for  a  front  end.  Sounds  interesting.   Too  bad  the
     "establishment"  still  wants to treat him like some kind of hobo
     on the doorstep. Hard feelings are bound to result.


     Here are a few more. I'm starting to feel better, so I'll be done
     soon.  If I forgot anybody or anything,  that's probably for  the
     Fidonews                     Page 21                   6 Apr 1987


     better. Don't feel slighted, if I feel the need later I'll get to
     you!

     Phil  Becker.  TBBS  author.  His  orientation  is  somewhat more
     commercial than,  say,  Wynn's.  He and Thom  have  linked  their
     software in such a way that you can have 100% compatible (but not
     100%  identical)  Echomail  messages.  Of course,  what "not 100%
     identical" means is that,  for the sake of performance (Phil said
     this is "10 times faster" - who would be fool enough to do it the
     OTHER  way?) you truncate the seconds,  fold the subject field to
     upper case,  and truncate IT to 40 characters.  Too bad  KILLDUPS
     doesn't like it. Grey Mist should have known better.

     Tom  Jennings.  I  owe  him an apology.  I think what you've been
     seeing lately from him is,  to quote another BBS developer I hold
     in  some  esteem,  "A  social  statement by the Author".  I think
     lavender hair and skateboarding is just  what  this  Romper  Room
     calls for.  Read some of the back issues of the IFNA echomail and
     find a BETTER way to avoid high blood pressure!  And we owe him a
     major  debt  of gratitude.  Kludge or no,  Fido started something
     that we've all found sufficiently worthwhile to be willing to put
     up with a lot!

     Mikey.  I don't have enough disk space on my system to  share  my
     feelings about him. For a while he served a useful purpose. Now I
     want a message filter. Anybody have a piece of software I can run
     to kill messages with the string "M I K E Y" in the "to", "from",
     "subject",  and  "text"  of a message?  I don't even want to READ
     that stuff any more.


     Well, that gets a lot off my chest. I feel better. I know I could
     just  kill  this  now,  you'd never read it,  therefore never get
     annoyed at me for writing them, but.... tough noogies. I can take
     anything you guys dish out.  I'm still here  after  9  months  of
     constant connection to the IFNA echo.  That should prove it.

          Well, I  still haven't  had much  chance to  look over a few
     things lying  around here  although I have promised myself to get
     to them  "real soon  now." I've made a few decisions on what this
     column will  cover in  the future,  mainly just  about anything I
     think is  worthy of note. While I will be "reviewing" major (read
     expensive) software,  I'm going to try to cover reasonably priced
     alternatives as  well. If things keep piling up I'll talk to Thom
     Henderson, the  editor, and  see what  he thinks of a much larger
     column for  an issue or two. Hopefully things won't get that bad,
     but I'll wait and see.

     -- Western Digital gets good marks for support --

          This week  started off fairly well. I had been asked to take
     a look  at a hard drive a friend of mine had picked up. He hadn't
     been able  to format  the drive, and was curious if it would even
     work on  his PC. Since he has the same controller I do, I figured
     it would  be no problem (I learned most of the tricks involved in
     setting up  hard drives  a few  months  ago  when  I  got  mine).
     Surprise! He  walks in  with a  76 1/2  megabyte hard  drive, and
     since we  both use  RLL controllers the first step was contacting
     the manufacturer  and finding  out if  the drive would work on an
     RLL controller  (many won't,  although they  will appear  to work
     fine initially).  After confirming  with CDC  that the  drive was
     approved for  use with an RLL controller, I got to undertake what
     I thought would be a major task, finding out how to perform a low
     level format  on the drive (9 heads, 925 cylinders, not exactly a
     run of  the mill  drive). My  biggest problem was getting a phone
     number for  Western Digital's tech support, and all that took was
     a phone  call to  a local  friendly dealer.  I was very surprised
     when I  called them,  got through  on  the  first  call  and  was
     immediately put through to a technician who was able to answer my
     question. Ends  result is  my friend  sending a  check to Western
     Digital for  a new  BIOS for  his controller card (only $25), and
     the new  BIOS is  supposed to  support any type of drive! Western
     Digital get  high marks  from me  on support, even if their phone
     number might be a little hard for a normal person to obtain.

     -- Microsoft Word --

          I've been  spending the  past few weeks trying out Microsoft
     Word (list  price is  $450, and I've been using it to write these
     columns), and  think I  may have finally switched word processors
     (I had been using Wordstar). Before I go any further let me state
     that word  processors are  a very personal thing, what I look for
     and like  in a  word processor  may be  very different  from your
     expectations. I've  learned this  the hard  way and wouldn't want
     Fidonews                     Page 23                   6 Apr 1987


     anybody else  to make  the same  mistakes. My  best advice  is if
     you're satisfied  with what  you're currently  using, then  stick
     with it.  These are  my  opinions  on  Word,  other  people  will
     probably have very different views.

          That out  of the  way on  to some of the things I like about
     Word. The  most important  feature in any word processor I use is
     that it  should be  able to print to a file without any more work
     on my  part, and  the ASCII  file should be in the same format as
     the  printed   file.  This   means  that   if  I'm   using  "full
     justification" the  ASCII file should be full justified (which is
     how it  works in  Word). This  was one  of the  things I couldn't
     stand about  Wordstar, I  had to  print to  a file, strip off the
     extra characters in the file (using an external program) and then
     hand edit  it in  non-document mode.  I still  use Wordstar to go
     over the  final product before I mail it in, but otherwise it now
     gathers dust  on my  shelf. Some  of the  other nice things about
     Word is  that I  don't have  to save  the document  when I  do  a
     spelling check  on the  document, I  can do  it within the "main"
     word processor  itself. Another  "feature" that I quickly came to
     enjoy is the WYSIWYG display, in a few letters I've used bold and
     italics and  it's nice to actually see bold and italic. I haven't
     had a  need for  the indexing, outlining, or style sheets; I have
     tried them  out just to see how it works. Word is also capable of
     putting two  subsequent paragraphs side by side. I used to have a
     friend who  worked at a radio station, he once asked me if I knew
     of any  word processors  that could  do this  and I  know have an
     answer for  him. His  use for  the side  by side printing was for
     some of  the "scripts"  used at the station, on one side would be
     the speech  part of  the broadcast  and on  the other  side there
     would be  the comments on sound effects and such. This might also
     useful in  theater and  TV with notes to the cameraman, lighting,
     and stage crews.

          The printer  support is  exceptional, I  just wish  I had  a
     laser printer  to see  how well  it works  with one  (support  is
     included  for   several  different   laser  printers).  Microsoft
     provides a  separate book  on supported  printers which goes over
     any limitations  of the  printer (a good example is several laser
     printers aren't  capable of  printing on the top line of a page),
     what fonts  and  font  sizes  are  available,  and  what  special
     features you can take advantage of from Word.

     -- Panasonic low end printers --

          While I'm  on the  subject of printers, it seems like a good
     time to  mention some  of the  current  Panasonic  printers.  The
     printers made  by Panasonic tend to be reliable, inexpensive, and
     include a  lot of  features not  normally found in the same price
     range. The  two printers  I'm going to mention here are the 1080i
     (list price  $319) and the 1091i (list price $419), both of which
     I've had  a chance to use on occasion. One of the nicest features
     about these  printers is  the easily  selected fonts on the front
     panel. You don't have to remember what series of buttons to press
     to get near letter quality, you just turn the printer offline and
     change the switch. The 1080i has 3 fonts available from the front

     panel (standard,  compressed, NLQ) while the 1091i has four fonts
     (one more,  a bold  Courier that's  proportionally spaced). While
     both printers  only have  a nine  pin print  head, they  are both
     capable of a fairly acceptable near letter quality (a few friends
     of mine  couldn't believe I used a dot matrix printer, although I
     could tell  the  difference).  Graphics  wise,  I  tried  running
     Certificate Maker,  Print Shop,  and ProDesign  II; each of these
     programs worked  with the  program being told it was connected to
     an Epson  printer. The  printers  also  have  the  capability  of
     printing the  IBM graphics  characters (mainly  for lines used in
     several  programs),   although  it  isn't  the  default  setting.
     Considering the  capabilities of  the printer  against the price,
     I'd say  they were  almost perfect for the user on a tight budget
     or for someone in college.

     -- HACK --

          While I  haven't had  too much  time to play it yet, HACK is
     the best  game I've  come across  this past  week. I  finally got
     tired of  seeing  the  conference  on  HACK  on  Usenet  and  not
     understanding the  messages, so I looked around and downloaded it
     from a local board. It's is basically a Dungeons and Dragons type
     game, while  it uses "graphics," it does not require any graphics
     card. Since  it originated  on the UNIX machines, it's capable of
     being run on almost any computer (most terminals still don't have
     the graphics  capabilities of  our PCs).  The version I looked at
     was 3.85,  and had  been customized  for the PC, meaning that the
     arrow keys  worked. I  don't think  I will  spend as much time on
     HACK as  I  did  on  Leather  Goddesses,  but  that's  just  from
     frustration. If  anyone out  there can  give me any good clues on
     how to  get down into the deeper parts of the dungeon, please let
     me know. I've gotten to used to my adventures where things always
     start out the same.

          The best  book this  week is  "Using Reflex"  by Mick Renner
     (list price  $ 19.95  from QUE).  It's helped  explain a lot that
     wasn't immediately clear to me from Borland's manual on Reflex. I
     mentioned Reflex  a few  weeks ago,  and am  still playing around
     (actually more  real use  than playing  around)  with  it.  Other
     people around  me are  capable of  understanding Reflex and while
     they couldn't  use my  former database, they are capable of using
     Reflex.

          I  once   again  welcome  your  comments,  suggestions,  and
     opinions on  anything I've  written about  or a specific piece of
     software/hardware/whatever. Below  is my  US mail  address  along
     with my  Usenet and  FidoNet addresses.  I'll try  and answer all
     mail that  I receive, and if I think you've asked a good question
     (one that I think a lot of people have) I'll try and answer it at
     the end  of a  future column.  If you're  a user of a BBS, please
     mention to your sysop that netmail to me should be routed through
     157/0, 157/1,  or 157/502.  Your sysop  will understand what this
     means, if  you are  a  sysop  just  take  note  of  the  previous
     sentence. If  all goes  well,  I  should  be  giving  some  first
     impressions on some hot new software next week.

                                 WHYDOESIT?
                               by Kerry Roach
                      OpusNODE 362/1 - Chattanooga, TN

       This column will attempt to answer some of the  questions  that
     have  you  scratching  your  head.  If we don't know the answers,
     hopefully we can find someone who can help.

       Recently I purchased a copy board for my 1000.  After following
     the directions for installation explicitly,  the 1000  failed  to
     boot  with  the  copy board installed.  The machine would operate
     correctly if the hard disk controller card or the copy  card  was
     removed.  After removing the HD controller,  the copy card worked
     perfectly.  Several calls to the copy card manufacturer failed to
     produce results.  Finally I called the HD  manufacturer  and  got
     results, although the solution is not the most convenient.

       The  1000  has  interrupts  2,  3,  and  4 available on the I/O
     channel while the "standard" I/O channel has interrupts 2, 3,  4,
     5, 6, 7 available.  The "standard" HD controller uses interrupt 5
     to  signal  the  microprocessor that it needs attention,  but the
     1000 uses interrupt 2 (This can be changed on the 1000SX).  Since
     the 1000 has only 3 interrupt lines available on the I/O bus, the
     copy  card also uses the same interrupt.  On initialization,  the
     HD controller and the copy card both attempted to  use  the  same
     interrupt line and DMA channel.  This cause the machine to "LOCK-
     UP" since the devices both had the  same  priority.  The  problem
     requires  the  removal of the HD controller anytime that the copy
     card is to be installed and used.

       Please direct any questions to me by use  of  THE  LAST  RESORT
     INFORMATION  SYSTEM.  We'll  do  our  best  to get you an answer.
