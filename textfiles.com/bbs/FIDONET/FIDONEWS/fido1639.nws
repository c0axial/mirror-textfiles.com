                           Letters to Editor Policy

     One of the "perks" of editing Fidonews is reading the mail which
     comes in.  Without this mail, putting together each issue would be a
     lonely chore, dry and uninteresting.  Each letter which comes in,
     however, breathes life into the ol' Snooze.  Suddenly, we have a
     READER!  Someone cares about what was presented - Fidonews hasn't
     whithered and died on hundreds of hard drives around the world!

     Naturally, I like to share the good news with the other readers of
     the Snooze through the "Letters to the Editor" column.  I was
     cautioned recently, though, by one reader who intended his
     correspondence to be private, that I should be careful in what I
     print.

     This is my dilemma:  I literally can't tell from most letters
     whether that letter is intended to be private or public.  I don't
     really want to betray anyone's trust by revealing something they
     don't want public, but I don't want to become so intimidated by the
     prospect that I consistently take the "safe" course and don't
     share anything.  After consideration, I figured I'd handle "Letters
     to the Editor" in the following manner.  Your comments would be
     appreciated.


                             WHAT i WON'T PUBLISH

     1.  Letters where you specifically ask me not to reveal the
         contents.
     2.  Letters which are obviously of a personal nature.


                             WHAT I WILL PUBLISH

     1.  Letters where you specifically ask me to publish.
     2.  Letters which relate to Fidonews or articles published therein,
         where publication shouldn't embarrass the author.
     3.  Letters from public echoes which are deemed of interest to
         Fidonews readers.


     Hopefully, the above policy will balance confidentiality and the
     objective of making Fidonews interesting reading.

     You wrote under "What's not happening":

     " You don't deserve to be the top story in the What's Not Happening
     column... but it's been two and a half months."

     You are quite correct: The past three and a half weeks have been
     spend waiting for Bob Satti to return from vacation. The transition
     is now in process.

                             Echolist Controversy

     The Echolist mechanism is currently under attack in the Z1_BACKBONE
     echo.  It's an old argument, actually, fueled by the fact that a
     moderator can find that his echo belongs to another individual under
     some circumstances.  The argument has been around for at least the
     last three elist keepers with no particular resolution, so I doubt
     that this round of arguments will result in any changes.

     The echolist, or elist, is a list of echo areas and their moderators
     along with other pertinent information.  It's important to zone 1
     echomail in that all major distributors use it to determine the
     legal moderator for such issues as adding the echo to the
     distribution list and making feed cuts.

     It's relatively easy for a moderator to establish a new echo in zone
     1.  All he need do is find an unused echo tag (the name of his echo
     as programmed into various tossers), and then list that plus a
     password plus other optional information in a letter to the elist
     robot.  The elist robot adds the information to its data base and,
     from that point on, the moderator with the password is the owner of
     that echo for the next six months.  So long as he remembers the
     password, he may extend the six months by continuing to send
     messages to the robot.

     Where the controversy occurs is that, if a moderator forgets to
     update, his listing expires after six months, and anyone may relist
     it with any password they choose.  Some individuals have made a
     practice of watching the expirations and then "grabbing" the echo
     with a simple letter to the robot.  If the original moderator is
     still around, he may consider the echo hijacked... though defenders
     of the system point out that the original moderator had plenty of
     time and opportunity to update, including a letter that the echo
     would expire in most cases, and that he simply failed to do his
     job... losing the echo in the process.

     Those criticizing the elist procedure have suggested a "grace
     period" during which the echo would fall from the elist, but it
     couldn't be relisted without the password.  A grace period of from
     one month to six months has been suggested.

     I personally agree with critics that such a grace period would
     dampen the enthusiasm of those who "collect" these echoes... but
     have they considered the cost of this result?  It would also make
     the relisting of an echo whose moderator has lost interest or even
     left Fidonet more difficult.
