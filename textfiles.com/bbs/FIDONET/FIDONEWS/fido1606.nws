     Greetings,

     Whats happening with the routing of mail within Zone 1?  Are the
     problems solved? ;-)

     Had one heck of a week, with work and more work.  It's good for the
     pocket I hear you say?  Nope, the taxman takes nearly half.

     Anyway, there is going to be another very busy week ahead, so please
     excuse the once again short note from me. ;-(

     Enjoy,

     Grunged Echomail Deleted - Retraction

                           Grunged Echomail Deleted
                         Retraction by Douglas Myers
                         1:279/720, doug@mdtnbbs.com

     Last week, I submitted an article in the name of Roy Tellason
     entitled "Grunged Echomail Deleted."  This was originally sent to me
     netmail by Roy, and was intended only for my information, not for
     publication.  I misread the intent of his netmail:  he had asked of
     me information on contacting FIDONEWS, and I took this as a request
     to submit the article for him.  He has since informed me that he
     preferred to work out the complaint more quietly, and was chagrined
     that I jumped the gun on publication.

     I'd like to publicly apologize to Roy, who's confidence I violated,
     and to John Souvestre, who has enough trouble right now that he
     doesn't need any agitation from this corner.  I'd further like to
     congratulate these two gentlemen for making the effort to work
     things out without a lot of fuss, thus bucking the trend here on
     FightOnet.

                               BROKEN BACKBONE
                  Douglas Myers, 1:270/720, doug@mdtnbbs.com

     After George Peace resigned as zone hub and disconnected from John
     Souvestre (for echomail, anyway), several participants in the
     BACKBONE echo pronounced the North American Backbone "broken."  It's
     been hard to detect at this node - echomail has been coming in and
     going out at a seemingly undiminished rate, and all the echomail
     here flows through George's system.

     As a confirmed echomail junkie, I've attempted to follow the bloated
     BACKBONE echomail conference to get some idea as to what's going on.
     It's somewhat like panning for gold in the local Susquehanna River -
     I need to push through a lot of mud and debris to uncover a rare
     nugget.  Some nuggets I've uncovered:

     - George is still an ZHUB, but he's no longer a NAB ZHUB.  The main
     distinction between the two is that a ZHUB merely moves the mail,
     but NAB ZHUBS take on other obligations being revealed gradually by
     John Souvestre.  The only solid information I can offer at this
     point is that NAB ZHUBS follow published routing charts (most of the
     time) to move netmail.

     - Of the major mail movers, George and John don't want to work
     together, Bob and John don't want to work together, and Ken wishes
     everyone would just get along.

     - Up until recently, George retained his connections to Bob Seaborn
     and Ken Wilson and continued to supply all his downlinks with
     echomail, with no apparant loss of mail.  However, dupes started
     appearing on John Souvestre's system, caused by the fact that mail
     sent through George's system no longer contained John's node number
     in the seen-by lines.  This caused the tossing software at Bob's and
     Ken's system to BOTH pack echomail messages for John.  As nearly as
     I can tell from the conversation, dupe detectors at John's system
     prevented these duplicates from flowing to his downlinks.  George
     has since relinked echomail to John's system, presumably to prevent
     the duplicate generation which results if he doesn't.

     The BACBONE isn't broken yet, but it seems like a marriage in
     trouble.  The trial seperation didn't work out as the partners found
     that they have to work together, but they still haven't worked out a

     Engines' Fast.Serv FastCGI software product to enhance its Web server
     performance.

     "GSCC is moving rapidly to deliver information using Web technology to
     its participant community, which consists of approximately 100 of the
     major Wall Street firms.  Due to the anticipated high volume and
     complexityof these Web based information requests, GSCC needed to
     provide its users with rapid, reliable connections and information."
     Said Sal Matera, a Vice President at GSCC.

     "The Fast.Serv product gives GSCC the tools it needs to be successful
     in developing Web based application software and frameworks.  Unlike

     leverage on existing software and hardware investment and expertise.

     persistent connections to databases and Corba servers BEFORE the
     client accesses our site.  The result is that we are able to turn page
     requests around on our Digital Alpha servers very quickly.  Fast.Serv
     was the right choice for the development process and fits well into
     GSCC's technology infrastructure." Continued Matera.
