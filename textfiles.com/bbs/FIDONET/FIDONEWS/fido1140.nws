   Again Sunday night, again late, and again company downstairs.

   A good snooze this week, starting with an update on the ZEC
election. More NC vs NC battles in Hong Kong (why not *three*
positions in the net [RC, NC, & PC {Political Co-ordinator}]),
then we could have a rule that the PC *has* to play politics,
The NSC *cannot* play politics, and the RC's cannot to anything
but tally the membership lists ...

   mmm, sounds like the world ....

     Swamp Swine Magazine,
     Shuckmagosh, Ohio

     Dear Reverend Visage,

     I am sorry to hear that you have been detained by passport
     control at the Quebec border. I suggest that you explain
     that you are merely returning to Ottawa to courier another
     $34 million dollars worth of federal swag to our culturally
     paranoid brethren in the burgeoning republic of poutine.

     After much research I  have discovered the reason why our
     ZC, Bob Satti (cue the plague of locusts), has remained
     singularly uncommunicative during  his term. It seems that
     he has been locked in a conclave of cardinals with the other
     ZCs where they have been sacrificing goats and divining the
     entrails in an effort to choose a new IC. Their
     deliberations were made more complicated due to  the fact
     that they had to find an appropriately weaselly exception to
     their beloved Bible: PeeFour; before they could boot George
     Peace upstairs into  the position. Our prayers and our
     edible underwear should go out to them for having attained
     Divine revelations. In region 12 we are reminded that the
     ghost of Bob MacKay will hover over George Peace as a result
     of Peace's Thomas a Becket, "Would that he were gone"
     efforts which occurred when our region was slowly emerging
     from  the malign ministration of Fidodespots.
     
     I advise caution, Visage, in using your various hard-earned
     Fido titles appended to messages. It seems that the contused
     minds in Net250 have determined that messages calling for
     the RC, Rick "Cocoon" Johnston's nether bits on a platter,
     when signed using a Fidotitle, are grounds for a policy
     complaint. Of course, in the socially arrested environment
     of Net250, *everything* is grounds for policy complaints and
     it has become such a happy hunting ground for the litigious.

FidoNews 11-40                 Page:  ?                    03 Oct 1994

     They have perfected a means of file attaching lawyers to
     each other in their efforts to "prove" points. The most
     recent dwarf-like concern arises over their net's purchase
     of a satellite dish. As an aside, Visage, I fear they may be
     less than amused when they discover that we have sold them
     the left cup of Mitsou's bustier but with the planetoid
     beings' abysmal technical standards, it'll take them months
     to notice.
     
     The only good news arising this week is the meltdown of the
     NHL player/owner trough-wars. I am outraged, as would any
     average citizen, that a rookie player should be compelled to
     accept a paltry $270,000 for chasing a small black rubber
     object over frozen surfaces, and that journeymen players
     should be asked to put a freeze on the mere $47,340 per game
     that they have been offered. The news of the lock-out is
     excellent because, in a moment of weakness, I had purchased
     season's tickets to the games of the women's broomball team
     which the Ottawa elflords had erroneously identified as the
     NHL hockey team: The Senators. Watching their playing style
     has been about as exciting as watching squid mate. (Note, I
     said "watching", and I realize that your participatory
     endeavours in such activities may have added more interest.)
     
     I must go, Visage, your secretary has an evil snarl on her
     face and is threatening to phone Bill Clinton to tell him
     that our office is the next easily conquered Third World
     country. Her distemper has nothing at all to do with the
     fact that I have spent her entire pension on Glenlivet
     quality control testing. As a good and decent gesture,
     Visage, I suggest that we offer her an all-expense paid
     vacation on a Swedish ferry.
     
     Regards,

Subject: Graduate Research Paper on Fidonet

I'm in the process of writing a term paper for my Networks and
Telecommunications class at Illinois Institute of Techology's Stuart
School of Business. The professor is an expert in the federal
governments FTS-2000 network standards and contributed to a large
part of the ISDN standards for high speed data communications. He is
still called upon for expert testimony in Washington every now and
then. Even after all this he had not heard of the Fidonet.

My paper will discuss the history and current status of the Fidonet.
I've had my system, Ham'nd Eggs, a node on here since March.
FidoNews 11-40                 Page:  5                    03 Oct 1994

Fidonet, I feel, is one of the unsung heroes of the Information
Superhighway story.

In order to base my paper on facts (and official hearsay), I would
like as many back issues of the Fidonews as possible. Also if there
are standards, documents, personal stories, etc. that would help me
tell the story of Fidonet, I would love to have access to them. Just
point me in the right direction!

Thanks a bunch.
--Bob.

Hello Nils!

Regarding the "Re-engineering of Net 700", I can say that it seems
like the RC have appointed a NC that isn't supported by the nodes in
the net in question. This isn't a good situation, and from what I can
tell, the RC is a servant, not a master when assigning a new NC. If
the RC is assigning a NC that isn't accepted by the majority in the
network, then the RC has failed and should either resign as RC or
make a new assignment in cooperation with the nodes in the net in
question.

Subj : The real story between Samson and me which is
       proved by most SysOps !!

Simpify the story as the following: Samson fired me because I
couldn't handle the node application forms very fastly (he said). But
in fact, he fired me due to his jealous to me. And he wants to
control Fido under his hand. And the old Zone Coordinator and I had
removed his RC and NC positions before 7 years. Therefore, he was
angry with me because I had fired him before 7 years. Before one
year, my father was dead and soon my girl friend had left me. And I
had moved my house and some hardware problem happened in my system.
During those periods, I had no spare time to reply some application
forms very fastly. Therefore, Samson had got two complaint letters
from two new SysOps. Then, Mr. Samson Luk used this reason to fire me.

In fact, I and my co-sysops are serving Net 700 smoothly. He fired me
without any warning. Why no warning although I had talked with him by
VOICE before he fired me ??

TOO BAD !!?

Thanks for your attention !

Best Rgds. Louie

The Rain Ditty

by Murry Francis 1:2215/5
Rain, my thoughts...
Note: This is just a very short story about rain, if it is off topic
for the Snooze, please feel free to do your duty;-)

It was raining, raining very hard and steady and I loved the rain.
Somehow when it was raining I felt so close to nature in a way,
and that feeling was so nice, that of feeling at home with my
surroundings. I could see the drops raging down from the sky,
beating on the grass, roof, and anything else in it's path. The
trees, and all plants gave off this aura to me that they were
being fed the lifes essance that was needed so badly by them.

Many people do not care for the rain as I do, whenever it rains
they seem to bitch about it, and shiver. I just figure those
people are not "Rain" people as I am. They wish for sunny hot days
so they can do what "Sun" people enjoy, you see those people do
not welcome changes in weather, alot of them want it to be 85 to
90 degrees and sunny every day. I enjoy sunny days also, but
welcome the changes that nature sends me, they on the other hand
do not, and whine about rain, hhrrrmmmppphhhh!!

When I was a child my siblings and I would go outside in the rain
and play in it. In the middle of summer, rain was a welcome sight
and a relief from the scorching heat of the day. We would go to
puddles, and the side of the street where the rain would gather to
make the long trek down to the storm sewer, we would lay in the
rain water, and splash, jumping and stomping, we had a blast in
the rain. I guess that was my beginngs in my special relationship
with rain, and it has grown with me through this life. To this day
whenever it rains I want to go out in it, and walk, yes strange as
it may sound, I truly enjoy the rain.

Hi, Editors.

The following is something I zipped off during my night course on
Intro to MacIntosh Word, at least the letter is.  When I showed it
to the teacher it really cracked him up, so I thought I'd share it
with folks.  As long as MADam Emilia is doing her Ann Landers
Wanna-be scthick, I figured I might as well do it as a letter to her,
and submit it in the following format.

Deere Madman Emilia....

     Im taking nite courses in MacIntosh Word and i have just
completed one of the exersices.  It is a good peace of writing cause
i used the spell checquer to spell checque it..  But i do have a
question cause of the way it turned it out.  It is not exzactly the
same way as in the excerise book.  Hear is what i writ.

Dear, Dufous.

This year is the 50th anniversary of the introduction of tofu and
other mind altering substances at this university.  To celebrate this
special demi-centennial, a number of student groups, most noticeably
the Panzer-jagends Feurher, have joined to plan Tofu Festa 50, a week
long celebration forced on us by Big Brother and the imperialistic
geeks of totalitarianism who are too spineless to stand up, never
mind stand up to the fascist antidisestablishmentarianist regime of
kindergarten drop outs.

To quote Laura Palmer (and boy am I glad they killed her in Twin
Peaks), who was head of the Student Soy Council and Hog Calling Club,
as well as last year's Tofu Queen (a position awarded to her for
turning in her kid sister):

     The spirits of distilled tofu products has touched all of us on
     this campus.  Never before has a mind altering substance created
     such feelings of camraderie and hang over.  We truly are what we
     eat, a concept difficult to reconcile with a liquid diet.  As a
     result, the theme of this year's special festivities shall be

     "Tofu Is Us."

Fifty years of fascist preparation and suppression, as well as several
executions, have gone into planning the "Tofu Is Us" campaign.  We now
demand your support, on behalf of the Ministry of Truth, as a sponsor
of this event to provide whatever money, supplies, or manpower we
require, whether you can afford it or not, to make Tofu Festa 50 the
hallucination propagating fantasy-come-true sucess the tyrants want so
they can continue to brain wash us.

Thank you for your generous contributions and for not giving Big
Brother any reason to suspect your loyalty.

Sincerely,

Q:   My question is am i computer illiterate or is my memory too random
access?

A:  Dear fang-face, you have entered the realm of non-linear thinking,
which is evidenced by your cravings for delusion and amusement seeking
demeanor.  No, you are not computer literate, you are computer literati.
I would suggest immediate immersion in fifth generation languages before
completion of your Introduction to MacIntosh word course.

i thank you with enthusiasm for your contribution to the snooze.  i've
become rather schizoidal having to consistently tlak to misself in the
emilia column, and find you are offering a refreshing escape from the
drone of voices in my own mind.  wanna play?

Q:  Dear Fang-face:  Laura Palmer has re-entrantly situated herself inside
my memory.  I've tried various virus checking progroms to erradicate her
existence, however she has managed to interrupt control of my keyboard on
numerous occasions, leaving me with a ghost in my machine.  What should i
do??

Hi, Madam Emilia.

A:  Dear fang-face, you have entered the realm of non-linear thinking,
which is evidenced by your cravings for delusion and amusement seeking
demeanor.  No, yo are not computer literate, you are computer literati.
I would suggest immediat immersion in fifth generation languages before
completion of your Introduction to MacIntosh word course.

OK.  but that might be hard to due cause I'm only a third generation
person.  i also prefer to immerse myself in the hot tub or playboy
magazines.

=============
> wanna play?

Always. :-)

Q:  Dear Fang-face:  Laura Palmer has re-entrantly situated herself
inside my memory.  I've tried various virus checking progroms to
erradicate her existence however she has managed to interrupt control
of my keyboard on numerous occasions, leaving me with a ghost in my
machine.  What should i do??

Deere Emilia.

This sounds very sirius.  if Laura Palmer really is back then i think
we will have to treat her the way Scrooge recommends.

"If I had my way then every fool who goes about with a merry christmas
on his lips would be boiled in his own pudding and buried with a steak
of holly through his heart."

I understand that is standard treatment for people who won't stay dead.
You better board up that rear entrance too or there is no telling what
else might wonder in.

O yeah.  I understand that an old remedy for viruses is to eat a clove
of garlic.  this should also work against laura cause when the bug
bites you she'll drop dead from poisoning.

doant forget to clean the keybored.  if you doant clean it often enuff
then a family of gerbils will move in to nest in teh dustballs and live
off the crums that drop from your snacks.  Then you will have to call
the spca to find them a home....

Fang-face

Michael
