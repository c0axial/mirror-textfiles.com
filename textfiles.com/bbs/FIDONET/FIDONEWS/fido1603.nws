     Greetings,

     Does Zone 1 have probelms?

     Why is it, how people want to continue take an amateur network such
     as FidoNet and claim it their own.

     I'm not fully conversant to what has been happening with or how the
     various systems, such as George Peace's work within Zone 1.  But
     why one person should try and make it difficult for the free
     distribution of information is beyond me.

     What is a hub trying to achieve?

     Instead of standing together and building up a network, no, we need
     to break it up so that people cannot enjoy it fully.

     I would appriciate some feedback, on how the various hubs, such as
     George's system, operate within Zone 1.  I know, George is a very busy
     man, so if I do not receive details from him, no sweat.
     Thanks in advance.

     Happy reading,

     FIDODOWN
     By: Kent Anderson,   kand@onr.com

     To the Editor:

     Thanks for publishing the very frightening statistics on the
     shrinkage in the Fidonet nodelist.

     These figures become even more alarming if one looks behind them and
     realizes that over one third of the nodes listed are not BBS's open to
     the garden variety user. They are administrative, mail only or private
     nodes.

     Many, many cities, towns and villages in Zone 1 have no BBS at all,
     and to participate in any way, a user must telnet into a Fido BBS. We
     owe a huge vote of thanks to those SysOps who provide these services.
     It may not be too long before that is the only way for a participant
     to access Fidonet.

     It is almost unbelievable to me that one who has experienced the
     chaos of the Usenet Newsgroups can prefer them to the moderated
     echoes of Fidonet. We all need to become evangelists in this regard,
     and spread the word about Fidonet and echomail. If we do not, it will
     certainly perish.

     The *real* stranglehold on Fidonet

     John Souvestre, echomail controller, manipulator
     by Gary Gilmore, 1:2410/400

     Once again, John Souvestre power-trips, and we all lose for it.  I
     give you this:

      Area : Z1_RBC
      Date : Sun Jan 10, 17:20
      From : George Peace                                         1:270/101
      To   : John Souvestre
      Subj : Low Traffic
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
      JS>Butch can't seem to find time to post in public, except for the
      JS>occasional proclamation.  George will wait till it's all over with
      JS>and then tell everyone what mistakes they made.  Ken and Bob will
      JS>follow the crowd in the long run.


     As usual, John, you've done your best to play politics in the
     shadows. As usual, you're afraid to venture out in the open until
     you've gathered up your fan club and instructed them how to act.
     As usual, you're using an amassed history of small incidents to
     develop a certain course of events that will once again return you to
     control. King John and JohnBone at any cost. Pardon me if I don't bow
     before you.

     Guess what. I'm not going to wait for your little game to play out.
     I'm damned tired of the games YOU have been playing. I'm damned tired
     of the acusations YOU have been tossing about. And most important,
     I'm damned tired of being slandered and defamed by the likes of YOU
     and your band of yes-men.

     I brought democratic reform to FidoNet. I pounded on tables and
     exposed you and your cronies when you wanted to shove unilateral
     policies in SysOps' faces without due process. I was the only thing
     standing in the way of your total control of FidoNet.

     Well Johnny, I'm finally done dealing with your petty games and
     accusations.

     Poof. Now there are three ZHubs. Your skapegoat is gone.

     -!- FLAME v1.1/b
      ! Origin: Pennsylvania Online! 717.657.9785 (1:270/101)

     One of the best, and most impartial ZHubs around (as well as the
     father of our current "Fidonet via Internet" method), bullied until
     he could take no more by "King John", and there we go.  John has yet
     again saved all us poor dumb sysops.
     FIDONEWS 16-03               Page 4                   25 Jan 1999


     Tired of this sort of "leadership" from John?  Tired of his "GMD"
     making decisions about YOUR echomail?  (Like killing mail because
     JOHN thinks it's too old)  Tired of John making moderators jump thru
     HIS hoops?

     Cancel your accounts with him, and use one of the others (George
     Peace, Ken Wilson, Bob Seaborn, or others that don't link thru
     Souvestre) and send him a real message.

     Get John out of OUR Fidonet business.  "Move the mail, and shut up,
     John".  That's the message we need to send, once and for all.

     Don't think John -is- into power?  How about this threat from John to
     Bob Seaborn in the Z1_BACKBONE echo:

      JS> This is strike three for you on this matter Bob.  Either fix it
      JS> or forget about remaining a NAB hub of any sort.

     Now maybe I'm wrong, but since when does John himself make decisions
     about who's a NAB Hub or not?  According to John himself, anyone that
     moves mail is a "NAB Hub", so what's he threatening here?  Is he
     threatening to keep Bob from moving any mail?  Or is he overstepping
     his bounds (yet again) and threatening to remove Bob as a ZHub.
     (Since it requires a majority of the OBO and ZHubs to make such a
     move, where does John get off making this sort of threat?)

     John's gotten into trouble once already for making arbitrary threats
     like this. He was completely against Bob Seaborn as a NAB Hub in the
     first place, and at the first opportunity, removed Bob from the Hub
     listing in the BACKSTAT.NA file.  Result?  Butch Walker pulled John's
     right to release the BACKSTAT,NA, and took back the production of the
     file.  (Which is why you now see the "Authorized version" tag on them
     now.)

     Need more proof of John's power tripping?  How about this quote from
     the FILE_MOVERS echo (where the FDN heads and Filebone hubs
     congregate):

     JS> There is a balance there.  Giving FDN heads any say at all in
     JS> running the Filebone upsets that balance, in my opinion.

     ..and then we have this:

     JS> I agree fully!  Also, the Filebone Hubs should have more say than
     JS> the FDN heads, in my opinion.  :-)

     Hmm.. the Filebone would be a pretty useless thing without the FDN's,
     yet John doesn't want the FDN coordinators to have any say in how the
     Filebone operates?  He wants to shut out the very people that make
     the Filebone possible.

     Why would that be? ...perhaps because John sees himself as "Filebone
     Hub #1"?  You draw the conclusions, but it's painfully obvious that
     John covets all the power he can wield.  John gets his power from
     writing rules, or whipping out "FAQ's" (and treating them like stone
     tablets from the mountain), or whipping up a frenzy amongst his
     FIDONEWS 16-03               Page 5                   25 Jan 1999


     supporters.  (Many of which are downlinks, and I'd venture that
     they're afraid to say "Boo" to John anyway.)

     John uses his GMD program to force YOUR echomail to fit the "specs"
     that he deems proper.  (Although some of his "specs" are not adopted
     Fidonet specs, mind you.)  How about the fact that John himself
     decides how old is "too old" where echomail is concerned, and stops
     it in transit.  Who gave him this power?  Where is there any Fidonet
     policy that says he has such a right?  Doesn't matter... John
     decided, and you've let him.

     It's high time that this sort of abuse of OUR echomail be stopped,
     once and for all.

     John (at least once) has pulled an echo from distribution because
     -he- didn't like it.  Is that what we need?  (Though he did hide
     behind a smokescreen of excuses for why he did it, and what his
     authority was to do it.  All weak excuses indeed.)

     John will get his power, or at least influence by any means,
     underhanded, by "rules" or "FAQ's" (which he usually writes), from
     behind the scenes, or in whatever manner he finds handy at the time.

     We will only be free from this oppressive influence when John is
     removed from the NAB, and his "power" over OUR echomail is diminished
     by such an action.  I urge you to write to these people and request
     that John Souvestre be removed immediately as NAB ZHub:

     Overseer of Backbone Operations:
                      Butch Walker        1:157/2    bwalker@en.com
       Zone Hubs:
                      Ken Wilson          1:12/12    kwilson@ccai.com
                      Bob Seaborn         1:140/1    bob@nwstar.com

     Many cry and wail about putting Fidonet control back into the hands
     of the "grunt sysop", but John Souvestre has no such desire.  Oh, he
     might say he does, but don't be fooled... anything that would remove
     his death-grip on the control of OUR echomail, or his influence on
     file distributions is completely out of the question for him.  He'll
     be totally against it, and will work against it either in public or
     behind the scenes (where he's most comfortable) to stop it.  You can
     turn that around.  Spend 5 minutes writing to one (or better yet) all
     of the above people with a simple statement;

             "I wish to see John Souvestre removed as a NAB Zhub"

     Only then can we really begin to put the "power" and "control" of OUR
     echomail (and file distributions) back into OUR hands.  It's up to
     -you-.

     I'll sit back now, and await the diatribe by John (or his followers)
     that's sure to follow.  He'll name call, slander, and try to
     generally discredit me or anyone that agrees with these views.  Don't
     be swayed by his "turn the tables" or "switch the topic" tactics.
     He's a master at it, and it's his forte.  That's how he's kept his
     power so long.  By bullying, blustering, and doing what some call his
     FIDONEWS 16-03               Page 6                   25 Jan 1999


     "Spin master" technique.  Expect it, but don't be fooled by it.
     If I'm lying, then so must George Peace. Allow me redirect you to
     his words above:

     "I pounded on tables and exposed you and your cronies when you wanted
     to shove unilateral policies in SysOps' faces without due process. I
     was the only thing standing in the way of your total control of
     FidoNet."

     George has probably worked closer with John Souvestre than anyone,
     and is privy to far more "inside" information than anyone.  His
     statement would seem to bear out what I've mentioned here, wouldn't
     it?  (Perhaps we should be worried more about what we don't know than
     what is obvious from John's actions, no?)

     Given the choice of the two, I think anyone would trust George's word
     over John's.  (Unless, of course, you're part of the "John can do no
     wrong" party.)

     Remove John, and remove the self-proclaimed king from the throne he
     has stolen from us when we weren't watching.  Again, I urge you to
     write & send your netmail (or email) today, and send it direct, just
     to avoid any potential "problems".

     An old friend of mine died last week.

     OPUS 1.03 Makes Last Event Exit
     Storrs, CT, USA <FidoNews>

     Sometime in the wee hours of January 4, 1999, OPUS v1.03 quietly
     curled up its toes and died peacefully in its sleep.  It was 11 years
     old.  The quickness of the end came as a surprise to its long-time
     friend and last remaining sysop, Lee Ayrton.  "It was well known that
     OPUS 1.03 had difficulty with leap years," said Mr. Ayrton in a
     prepared statement, "And we knew that OPUS wouldn't make it past The
     Great Rollover, but we didn't expect v1.03c to go so soon."

     Forgotten by most of its former sysops and users, OPUS 1.03 lived on
     at 1:320/455 on a small hard disk with its companions, Binkley and
     QMail.  "OPUS was its usual self the day before, handling a caller
     just fine," said Mr. Ayrton, "And now it is gone.  It was a fine
     program, one that I've known for over a decade, and I shall miss it."
     OPUS 1.79a has now taken over the BBS duties.

     While no autopsy was performed, it was assumed that the same internal
     date calculation difficulties that had caused problems in 1990 were
     responsible for its inability to load this year.  OPUS 1.03 had twice
     undergone post-release patching.  Efforts to resuscitate the aging
     BBS by reinstalling version b in place of version c were fruitless
     and v1.03 made its last Event Exit at 10am on January 4th.

     OPUS v1.03 remained robust, caller-friendly and flexable to the end.
     In spite of its reputation for repeatedly biting new sysops during
     FIDONEWS 16-03               Page 7                   25 Jan 1999


     initial set-up, OPUS 1.03 was once the choice of thousands of FidoNet
     sysops and was well known for its wry sense of humor -- and its habit
     of greeting other OPUS BBSi with the exchange "YOOHOO/2U2".  Once
     supported by scores of developers, it learned to run external doors,
     allowing on-line games and other tricks that it hadn't been designed
     to do.

     OPUS 1.03 is survived by three later releases.  It was predeceased by
     three earlier releases and by v2.xx.  No services are planned.

     ROLLER_JAM!
     By: Bobby Queen, 1:3667/5, wizards@connectu.net

     For those of you considering whether or not to contact your REC to
     request the new echo ROLLER_JAM I just wanted to post the scores for
     this weeks game.  This beginning week featured the New York Enforcers
     vs the Florida Sun Dogs.  The Enforcers won by a score of 25 to 24.
     Next week the Florida Sun Dogs will be against the California Quakes.
     If you missed this weeks game then you missed a good one.  One of the
     referees got his arm broken while trying to break up a brawl.  I told
     you ROLLER_JAM was going to be more intense than Roller Derby was. If
     you are interested in seeing more about ROLLER_JAM on the WWW their
     address is www.rollerjam.com.  Or at least thats what I think it was.
     :)  I was too busy watching the action.

     They also have a fan club where you can get a newsletter and to find
     out about that just call 1-877-ROLLERJAM.  This is a toll free number.
     You can also get tickets through this number if you are going to be in
     the Orlando area and want to watch it live at Universal Studios.  Hawk
     from American Gladiators is one of the announcers.  So send in those
     requests today and lets get this echo backboned and get started talkin
     about the matches.

     And of course for the men those girls fighting are well worth the 2
     hour show. :)  See you in ROLLER_JAM which will be available soon at a
     HUB near you!
