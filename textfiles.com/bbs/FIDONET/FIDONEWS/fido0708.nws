                            LSTFMT Version 1.60

       The NodeList Formatting Utility for FTSC Compliant NodeLists

                            SysOp LoneStar CBCS

                             FidoNet 1:382/35
                             AlterNet 7:49/382

                             EggNet 99:9100/35


     LSTFMT is an abbreviated form which stands for List Formatter.
     LSTFMT is designed to take a RAW, FTSC compliant nodelist, and
     produce output in a variety of formats based on the user
     specified switches.

     When I first became a member of FidoNet, I wanted to have just a
     list of those nodes in my local net.  In order to get it I had to
     edit a 500K+ nodelist and then search for Host,382 (which took a
     LONG time).  Then, once I had extracted this information, I still
     had to 'tidy it up' to be of a more human readable form.  I also
     wanted all of the fields to line up.  And then, to get it to all
     fit in 80 columns.

     What I also wanted to do was extract all of the nodelist header
     comments to be able to read about any new developments going on
     in the net.

     Thus the initial release of LSTFMT only supported these 2
     functions.  But, as is the nature of software, other SysOps had
     additional ideas of functionality I could add.  So, in a mere 3
     months, the current version scarcely resembles the original.

     Here is a brief list of the features of LSTFMT:

     1.   Ability to extract comments from a nodelist.
     2.   Ability to extract information about nodes that match a
          keyword.
     3.   Ability to format information about any zone, region or net
          in the nodelist.
     4.   Ability to format the information in a variety of forms:
          1.   Raw output
          2.   Formatted output 132 columns wide
          3.   Formatted output 80 columns wide
     FidoNews 7-08                Page 2                   19 Feb 1990


          4.   Explicitly specify which fields to format and output
          5.   Shrink the nodelist for specific net processing
     5.   Ability to append multinet information into a single list.

     Because all you need is an FTSC compliant nodelist, you may use
     nodelists from virtually all of the amateur networks, including
     but not limited to FidoNet, EggNet, AlterNet, Network and more!

     The following is a brief description of the operation of the
     program:

     LSTFMT /I<Input_file> /O<Output_file> /N<Net_number>
     /S<System_info> /Pnscypbf /K<zone>,<region>,<net> /C /T /A /R

     Where all arguments are entered on the same line interactively or
     via a batch file.  All arguments are optional.

     /I<Input_file>

     This is the nodelist file from which to extract the information.
     If you fail to specify the filename extension, LSTFMT will
     calculate the day number of the current nodelist and will attempt
     to open the file with the nodelist day as the file name
     extension.  If you do not use this switch, LSTFMT will attempt to
     use the current expected NODELIST.### file.

     You may use any valid Drive:\directory\path\filename.ext.

     /N<Net_number>

     This is the Zone, Region, or Host net from which to extract and
     format the information.

     If an '*' is specified as the net_number, then all nets in the
     input nodelist will be formatted.  This parameter will supercede
     the /S switch.

     /C

     This indicates that all comments should be extracted from the
     nodelist input file.  Only comments with text following them will
     be extracted.

     /O<Output_file>

     Is the file to which the extracted information is to be written.
     This file does not have to exist, but it will be created in the
     same directory as LSTFMT if it does not exist.

     You may specify any valid Drive:\directory\path\filename.ext.

     FidoNews 7-08                Page 3                   19 Feb 1990


     If this switch is not specified, the output will be sent to the
     system terminal (console).

     If the <Output_file> cannot be opened, or if none is specified,
     then the output will be sent to the system terminal (console).

     *WARNING* If the file <Output_file> exists, it will be deleted
     and the current output from LSTFMT will be directed to the new
     file.  Refer to the use of the /A switch for appending output to
     existing files.

     /S<System_info>

     This is specific system information that LSTFMT is to search for
     and extract to the output file.  This may be any text string.
     Each system found which contains this information in the
     input_file will be formatted and written to the output file.
     This may be system name, sysop name, baud rate, etc.

     If no /N net number is specified, all Zones, Regions and Hosts in
     the input file will be searched.  If a /N net number is
     specified, only that net will be searched for this information.

     /T

     This indicates that the /Net output should be formatted for 80
     columns.  This is handy if you wish to use the output file for
     display via a B)ulletins Menu item.

     /A

     This switch indicates that the output is to be appended to the
     output file if it exists, rather than deleting the existing file
     first.  If the file specified does not exist, it will be
     created.

     /R

     This switch allows for RAW nodelist output.  If specified, the
     output will not be formatted for display purposes.  This switch
     overrides the /T switch.

     /K<zone>,<region>,<net>

     This switch will cause LSTFMT to produce a shrunK, or pruned
     NODELIST file which may be used as input to such programs as
     Parselst or Xlatlst.  LSTFMT does not attempt to provide the same
     kind of versatility as is available with programs such as
     ShrinkNl or Prune.  The intended purpose of this feature is to
     produce a list for the SysOp who only wishes to have a nodelist
     which is comprised of his local net, or a small number of
     specific nets.  This switch overrides the /P, /T and /R
     switches.

     FidoNews 7-08                Page 4                   19 Feb 1990


     These parameters must be in the order indicated.  Each parameter
     is optional.  If you do not specify any Zones, Regions or Nets,
     then LSTFMT will ignore this switch.  If you omit the Region and
     Net number, then LSTFMT will produce a list containing ALL nodes
     in ALL Nets in ALL Regions in the Zone specified.  If you omit
     the Net number, then LSTFMT will produce a list containing ALL
     nodes in ALL Nets in the Region specified.

     This switch supercedes the /N, /S, /P, /T and /R switches.

     /Pnscypbf

     This switch allows for POSITIONAL nodelist output.  If specified,
     the output will be positionally formatted for display purposes.
     This switch overrides the /T switch and the /R switch.

     The fields to be output are specified via the argument list.
     These are:

     1.   N - Node number.  This includes any information such as
          HOST, HUB, etc.  The field width is 10 characters wide.
     2.   S - System name.  The field width is 25 characters wide.
     3.   C - City.  The field width is 25 characters wide.
     4.   Y - sYsop name.  The field width is 21 characters wide.
     5.   P - Phone.  The field width is 16 characters wide.
     6.   B - Baud.  The field width is 5 characters wide.
     7.   F - Flags.  The field width is 25 characters wide.

     If the data for any field is larger than the field width, the
     data is truncated so that the information may be formatted in the
     specified widths.

     These switches may be in any order and may be in either upper or
     lower case.  They must be separated by a space.

     And that's all there is to it.

     LSTFMT is available via the SDS, or from LoneStar CBCS by using
     the 'magic' filename of, what else, LSTFMT.

     Regards,
     Steve.
