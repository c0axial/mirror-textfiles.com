     =================================================================

                                Who Are You?


     I've been writing to you for over a year and a half  now,  but  I
     can't  really say I know you.  I've carried on correspondence via
     FidoNet mail with many of you.  I've spoken to quite a lot of you
     by phone.  But there are only a handful of  you  that  I've  ever
     met.  Do I really know you?

     Electronic mail is wonderful, I can't deny that.  It's given me a
     chance  to  meet  people  I'd  never  have known otherwise.  I've
     formed valuable friendships that I'd be much the poorer  without.
     But  I  can  only  use  "meet" in a figurative sense.  While I've
     gotten to know many people,  I can never be sure just how well  I
     really  know  any of them.  There is some quality of face-to-face
     meetings that's missing in electronic mail.

     So much of human communication is undefined.  There  is  so  much
     that gets relegated to facial expressions,  tone of voice, and so
     forth, that I find myself often sending follow-up messages on the
     order of "I didn't really mean that,  I was just trying to make a
     joke!" Perhaps I'm just not that good at making jokes, or perhaps
     (as  I  suspect)  there's a whole spectrum of human communication
     that just doesn't come through in cold, ASCII text.

     I've seen this before.  I'm not all that "old"  to  FidoNet,  but
     I've  been communicating through computers for quite a long time.
     Two of my best friends today are people I met through a real-time
     conferencing system on the DTSS computer,  way back when I was in
     college (hating to reveal my age,  but we're going back ten years
     or more).  One thing I've found,  again and again,  is that email
     goes down smoother when you've had a chance to actually meet  the
     people you comunicate with.

     In fact,  of those two friends,  I had a serious problem with one
     of them until we had actually met and found out what  each  other
     was  really  like.  Things  just didn't work out right between us
     over the comm lines until we knew each other.

     This  is  why  I  see  the upcoming FidoNet Conference as such an
     important event.  This is the second conference,  and  the  first
     was  rather a closed affair (I wasn't even invited,  though I was
     editing FidoNews at the time).  That was the one  where  multinet
     operation  was  first  established  as  the  way to go.  This one
     coming up may be equally important, or even more so.  FidoNet was
     smaller last year,  and didn't seem such a  big  deal.  Now  it's
     larger,  and  has problems that were never envisioned a year ago.
     One may safely  assume  that  equally  weighty  matters  will  be
     discussed.

     But  even if not,  it's still an important event.  EchoMail makes
     it even more important,  because it makes you interact with  that
     Fidonews                     Page 3                   28 Jul 1986


     many more people.  So there are all those people you talk (type?)
     with  every  day;  what  are  they  really like?  Say you've been
     talking with "Mikey" every day for months.  Even if you think now
     that you don't like him, how can you really know?  You might feel
     differently once you've actually met him.  You  might  find  that
     he's a jerk,  as you already thought, or you might find that he's
     really a nice guy once you get to know him.  The  main  point  is
     that you CAN'T know until you've met him.  Remember, of those two
     friends I'd mention earlier,  one of them and I never  got  along
     until we'd met.  We've been good friends ever since.

     So  THAT  is why this conference is so important.  Never mind all
     the stuff about the IFNA business meeting  and  such.  Oh,  yeah,
     that's  important  too.  Especially if you're into political type
     maneuvering and such.  But the real importance of it all is  that
     you  get  to meet these people you've been talking with.  Even if
     you  haven't  been  talking  with  people,  then  this  is  still
     important,  because  it'll  give you a chance to meet interesting
     people to talk with in the  future.  This  isn't  some  group  of
     strangers you've never heard of and will never see again; this is
     a meeting of folks you've talked to or heard of that you can keep
     in touch with for the rest of your life.

     Believe  me,  this counts.  We hope to have a Third International
     FidoNet conference next year,  but we can't plan on  it.  All  we
     know for sure is that we're having one this year.  It takes money
     to  stage  one  of  these  things.   COSUG  has  graciously  (too
     graciously,  it's members might say) offered to sponsor  it  this
     year,  but  there  aren't  that many dues-paying organizations in
     FidoNet.  Who else can afford  to  sponsor  a  major  convention?
     It'd be nice if IFNA could afford to provide the seed money,  but
     IFNA is, at least at present, a very cash-poor operation that can
     just barely afford the paperwork involved in being recognized  as
     an  "official"  non-profit  corporation.  For  now  we  must look
     elsewhere, and elsewhere looks pretty bleak indeed.

     So now might be your last (and only) chance for quite  some  time
     to  come.  If  you  don't  make  it,  I,  at least,  will be very
     disappointed.  I'll be there,  and I'm looking forward to meeting
     you.  If  you  can't  make  it this year,  then I don't know when
     we'll ever be able to meet.  Like I said,  I've been  writing  to
     you  every  week  for over a year and a half.  I can't really say
     that I know you, but I sure would like to.

     Please come.  I'll miss you if you don't.

     Robert A. Rudolph, 109/628

                          Hard Disk Peace of Mind


     Those of us who operate Fido boards know  that  the  sanctity  of
     content  of  the  hard  disk  on  which Fido resides is of utmost
     importance if the BBS is to operate day after  day  in  a  manner
     that  is  reliable  and free of trouble.  NOBODY wants to make it
     into the doghouse.

     My PC Clone has 2 20-megabyte Seagate drives that I  love.  These
     are among the most reliable drives in the world.  STILL,  without
     regard to intrinsic reliability,  they have to be  backed  up  to
     some  other medium on a regular basis,  so that neither lightning
     nor your friendly utility company can scramble  your  FAT  or  do
     some  other  violence  to  the data that is so precious to proper
     operation of Fido.

     Here at the Reindeer Shed we use DataCare,  which  just  recently
     received a very favorable review from PC Magazine.  It is easy to
     use, being either command-line OR menu-driven,  is reliable,  NOT
     copy-protected,  and  well  documented.  It  is  not  as  fast as
     FastBack,  but is at least as reliable.  Because  it  writes  the
     backup  diskettes  in  IBM  backup format,  no restore utility is
     needed,  so no matter what happens,  your PC-DOS or  MS-DOS  disk
     will  restore  your  files,  sub-directories or complete disks in
     whatever way you wish.

     DataCare also includes a file compare  utility,  a  revised  (and
     much  smarter  and  more useful) DIR replacement,  and a file and
     directory RENAMER that even allows INTERNAL DOS  commands  to  be
     renamed.

     As  DataCare  operates,  it creates backup diskettes (if you have
     the good fortune to have 2 floppy drives,  it will alternate  be-
     tween  them) that are labeled,  and it will refuse to overwrite a
     diskette that it knows it has just created.  It maintains a  file
     that  can  be searched to fine the diskette on which a particular
     file resides,  so that you needn't feed 30  diskettes  to  it  to
     restore  a  file  on diskette 31.  Its last act is to back up the
     locator file to the last diskette,  so the diskettes ALWAYS  have
     the  index  set  associated with a given set resident on the last
     diskette in the set.

     DataCare will also do incremental backups, and is smart enough to
     request the last diskette in the series to which files are to  be
     appended to be mounted in a drive, at which time it reads off the
     index  of  files,  appending  to both the diskette series AND the
     index of files,  again backing up the index of files as the  last
     file on the diskette set.

     Fidonews                     Page 5                   28 Jul 1986


     DataCare verifies diskettes as written, and does not require that
     diskettes  (after  the  first  diskette  in  a  backup series) be
     formatted,  being capable of formatting them "on  the  fly".  The
     error checking that is done on both the primary and backup medium
     is  exceptional  -  files  that  I  could not read with any other
     utility DataCare has been able  to  read.  Because  it  does  not
     depend  on  the  error recovery in DOS,  it is not subject to DOS
     error recovery flakes, as are some other utilities.

     Another unique feature of DataCare is that each licensed user  is
     not  only  permitted  but  encouraged  to give a limited copy (by
     limited I mean that the program  works  for  three  weeks)  to  a
     friend or acquaintance who wants to try it out. I personally have
     sent  more than a dozen copies out to friends,  many of whom were
     impressed enough to have paid the old price.

     I have saved the best part for last.  The price of  DataCare  has
     been  $129.95 for over a year.  The price has been cut to $49.95.
     How long this price will hold I do not know.

     Questions may be addressed to me  at  Fido  109/628,  or  to  the
     publisher at the above address.

     Fido 109/628 has no financial interest in Ellicott Software,  and
     receives nothing in return for this review.  We just like to  see
     someone who has done his homework be rewarded for his effort, and
     the author of DataCare has done his homework well.

              NOTES ON CONNCENTRAL FIDO SYSOPS MEETING, 7/5/86

     A small group of Fido Sysops met at Jim Ryan's office (Presco) in
     Woodbridge  to  discuss  matters  pertaining  primarily  to   the
     ConnCentral Net. The following topics were discussed:

     1. Picnic:  A  picnic will be held on Saturday,  July 19,  at the
        Lake Quassapaug Amusement Park.  The picnic will  be  open  to
        all  Bulletin  Board  people (and their families).  Sysops can
        announce the picnic on their boards.  Bring  your  own  drinks
        and  food to share.  Jim Ryan is in charge and will send out a
        file on it.

     2. Responsibilities  of Sysops:  Chuck Venter made the point that
        although  he  is  the  Net  Coordinator,   it   is   not   his
        responsibility to monitor individual nodes, or provide all the
        answers  to everybody questions.  The Sysop EchoMail area is a
        good place to leave questions.  Chuck feels  he  doesn't  have
        time  for  everything  so  decided  to  delegate  some  of his
        responsibilities.

        New Users:  Bill Lyman volunteered  to  help  new  sysops  get
        started.  He  is  going  to put together an archived disk with
        all the files a new sysop  needs  to  get  started,  including
        utilities.

        Fido  Utilities:  Ed  Rauh  will  take  charge  of  keeping  a
        collection of all useful Fido Utilities up-to-date.  He  would
        like  all sysops to send him a list of the Utilities they have
        and the version number.  The files will be  kept  on  Cheshire
        Fido for convenience. Ed will set up a Server on his board for
        sysops  only so they can request files from him.  He will send
        around documentation on how to use the server.

        Modem Help:  Jim Ryan is available  for  technical  help  with
        modems.

        Reorganization  of  FidoMail:  Because  of  the  heavy flow of
        FidoMail and EchoMail through Cheshire Fido,  it was decided a
        decentralization  of  the mail was needed.  Based primarily on
        calling areas,  the Fidos were divided into four  groups  each
        with their own hub.  Chuck will send mail to each hub and they
        will  distribute to their own members.  Conversely,  each node
        will route all net mail to their hub who will send  it  on  to
        Chuck  (or  to  another  node in their own group.  This should
        greatly simplify matters and  eliminate  backlog  at  Cheshire
        Fido.  Bob  Morris  will  be  the  hub  for the Bridgeport and
        Milford  area,   as  he  has  toll-free   calling.   The   hub
        assignments  are  as  follows  (  all net 141 unless otherwise
        noted):

            Hub:    333           215            710            820
                  ------        -------         -----         ------
            Nodes:  335              9           730            550
                    375             42                          560
                    269            320                          810
     Fidonews                     Page 7                   28 Jul 1986


                    212         16/209
                    485         16/630
                    328         16/207
                    491            350

        Bill  Wonneberger  will also receive mail from 333 when he has
        his Fido set up.

        Each sysop should put the new routing  files  into  effect  on
        July 15 (for mail the morning of the 16th) This should give us
        a few days to test it and discuss any problems at the picnic.

     4. Connection with Hartford Net:  A few sysops from the  142  net
        were  present.  They  were  asked  if  they were interested in
        linking up with our net.  Bill Unghire (142/214) said he would
        bring it up with the other sysops. Bob Morris will try hooking
        up with Bill for EchoMail.  We do not have a connection to the
        Hartford area now but Bob can manage it somehow.

     5. Arbitration:   The  question  arose  how  to  resolve  various
        conflicts that come up between boards. At first an arbitration
        board was suggested, but was considered unnecessary.  Problems
        can first be discussed via EchoMail,  then if there is still a
        problem,  it can be arbitrated at the next sysop meeting.  The
        meetings will be held every two months.  Problem boards can be
        dropped  from  the  net and the information sent to the Region
        Coordinator.

     6. User problems:  Problems  with  user's  are  left  up  to  the
        individual  sysop.  EchoMail  should  be  used  to alert other
        Fido's.  Ed Rauh mentioned a bogus version of Fido  11u  which
        was uploaded to his system which caused it to crash.

     7. Next  meeting:  The  Next meeting is scheduled for Sept.  9 at
        7:30pm at the AT&T office in Hamden.  2750  Dixwell  Ave.  Bob
        Morris will be host.

     8. New  EchoMail:   Ed  Rauh  has  version  1.31  which  he  will
        distribute.

     9. Misc.: Bill Lyman is going to the Fido Conference out west. If
        anyone has anything they want him to bring up,  let him  know.
        Ray  Brand ( sysop of Lido Hotel) wants people to know he does
        NOT work at Computer Factory, so don't ask him prices already.
        Ed Rauh says he is restraining from mentioning his  prices  in
        EchoMail and others should do so too. All agreed.


     The meeting lasted about 3 hours. The attendees are as follows:

                        FidoNet Standards Committee


     This article is intended to describe the purpose and goals of the
     FidoNet Standards Committee.  Your input  and  feedback  will  be
     very much appreciated.

     The Problems
     ------------

     1. Implementors of FidoNet software (Fido  itself  and  the  many
        emerging "FidoClones") need a rigorous definition of FidoNet.

     2. When  deciding  whether  to  list a class of nodes in the node
        list,  the IFNA has no  way  of  knowing  if  a  FidoClone  is
        sufficiently compatible with FidoNet to be "safe" to list.

     3. Sysops  need to know if a particular system will allow them to
        access FidoNet.

     4. There are already two significant FidoNet standards,  the  one
        that is implemented by Fido, and SEAdog's extensions;  plus at
        least one clone that seems incompatible (not by  intent).  The
        situation is becoming urgent.


     The Goals
     ---------

     The goals of the FSC are,  of course,  primarily aimed at solving
     the above problems.

     Our first priority is to document the existing FidoNet  protocol,
     as designed by Tom Jennings,  sufficient to implement a FidoClone
     without recourse to other sources.  We  must  also  provide  IFNA
     with  some means of quickly and decisively determining the degree
     of compatibility of a given FidoClone,  thus  providing  a  wider
     range of systems to FidoNet sysops.

     Once this initial task is complete,  the next step is to document
     the  existing  extensions  to   the   basic   FidoNet   protocol,
     specifically including the added capabilities of SEAdog.

     Finally, when all of the existing protocols have been documented,
     we may then look at how the standard can be improved.



     We  optimistically hope to have the first stage (documentation of
     existing  protocol,   as  implemented  by  Fido)  ready  for  the
     International  FidoNet  Conference  in  Colorado Springs.  In any
     event,  we will be there and will present a  progress  report  at
     that  time.  We are also,  of course,  always open to suggestions
     and comments, and are available to answer any questions.

     David James, 132/104

                   EchoMail Can Help You Find Your Roots

     More people than ever are barking up the family tree and many are
     using the latest in high tech to do so.  Now a Genealogy EchoMail
     Conference has been started to enable those who have computerized
     their family research  to  take  advantage  of  FidoNet's  unique
     message-sharing capabilities.

     At  present,  the conference is running on two systems:  Commsoft
     Fido (143/26) in Mountain View,  California  and  Downeast  Roots
     Fido  (132/104)  in  Rye,  New Hampshire.  We believe this is the
     first time automatic unrestricted  message  communication  across
     the country has been available for genealogists.

     Genealogy  is  the third most popular hobby in America (only coin
     and stamp collecting appearing to have a larger following).  But,
     personal computing is rising rapidly as  an  avocation,  and  for
     good  reason.  We've  never before had an in-home tool that gives
     us the power to amplify our minds  and  labors  as  we  go  about
     performing  intellectual  tasks  and  enjoying the pursuit of our
     hobbies.  We hope the new Genealogy EchoMail Conference will be a
     guide to combining the power of the computer with the fascination
     of genealogy.

     Technology and interest in family origins and  relationships  are
     the  engine  and  fuel  which  will  drive family research to new
     levels of popularity, adequacy, accuracy, and importance.  But it
     is involvement with personal computers which will  make  each  of
     millions  of  genealogists  advocates  of  better  documentation,
     greater standardization,  more adequate access to  existing  (but
     hidden) information, and more sharing of unpublished data.

     Large  numbers  of  people involved in microcomputing are rapidly
     producing a society as familiar with technology  as  genealogists
     are familiar with genealogical research methods.  The marriage of
     technology   and   genealogical  methodology  is  ripe  and  most
     promising.  The potential for involving genealogists in computing
     is awesome.  The knowledge is dawning on  genealogists  that  the
     computer is a new, affordable, and powerful tool for research and
     records management or book production.

     For the present,  telecommunications is the most untapped area of
     microcomputing  and  nowhere  moreso  than   in   the   area   of
     genealogical   computing.   We   hope   the   Genealogy  EchoMail
     Conference will begin to change that.  If you would like to  join
     the  conference,  contact  Ken  Whitaker,  Sysop of Commsoft Fido
     143/26, via FidoMail.  Ken is conference coordinator.

                      Hunting Lutherans Amid the Fidos

     Scattered about out there in the  far  reaches  of  Fido's  touch
     there  must  be a few Lutherans.  For those of you who don't even
     know what a Lutheran is,  well,  you  may  never  know  just  how
     deprived  a life you lead,  though Garrison Keillor has helped to
     promulgate our reputation.  But just in  case  this  message  may
     grace the eyes of one of these rare birds,  are you interested in
     forming a net?  We could co-ordinate the list,  might  even  help
     with  some  kind  of  newsletter.  As  it  stands now,  Dr.  Mau,
     recently of  General  Secretary  fame  from  the  Lutheran  World
     Federation  is  on staff here and he is able to obtain the latest
     news from Geneva via telenet which we've been putting up  on  our
     board.  We've also been putting up selected "hot" news items from
     the World Council of Churches from their Ecumenical News Service,
     but  we're  not  as  timely  with them.  We could pass these news
     releases on through a net,  or just  help  pass  around  info  on
     computer  use in the church,  lesson plans and materials on faith
     development,  ecumenical  concerns,   i.e.;   the  dialogues  and
     education, sermon helps, Adult Forum ideas, Young Adult ideas (we
     minister with the yuppies of Capitol Hill in Washington - what an
     interesting lot they are), or perhaps you would want to echo mail
     some message areas on ethics or theology.

     If any of the above sounds at all interesting, send us a line, or
     if someone out there is already invloved in this,  send us a line
     too and we'd be happy to join in.  Send Fidomail c/o Brian Hughes
     109/634.

              An improved handler for Generic Fido on a Z-100


     Hello again.  This is just a quick note to let all H/Z-100 owners
     know of an improved version of the Generic Fido interrupt handler
     that  I  wrote.  Being  the  typical  type  of person that is not
     satisfied to leave well enough alone, I have added a few features
     to the handler that I think are useful.

     First, there is now a "watchdog" function for use when someone is
     outside Fido remotely.  When activated,  it simply  monitors  the
     modem and reboots the system if the caller hangs up.

     The second function,  and the one that was much more difficult to
     implement,  is an "answer and send message"  function.  The  idea
     behind  this  function  is  that  I  wanted  to not have incoming
     callers get either a constant busy signal or  no  answer  at  all
     when  I  was  using  the  machine  (and  therefore  Fido  was not
     running).  This function monitors the modem and when a caller has
     connected  it  determines the incoming baud rate and then sends a
     message.  The message can be  set  at  any  time  with  a  simple
     program  from  the  console (or a file) and activated/deactivated
     with two other small programs.

     The complete set of programs can be  downloaded  from  my  system
     (Fido 128/15 -- phone 303-591-4273).

     One  thing  I  would like to do is to compile a list of all Z-100
     based Fido's.  Therefore,  I would appreciate it if everyone  who
     is  running  a Z-100 based Fido would leave me a note (easy to do
     if you call to get the new version). I would also like to know if
     anyone has their own version of a Z-100 Fido  interrupt  handler.
     I  think that I have the first Z-100 based Fido and would like to
     confirm or (hopefully not) disprove this thought.

                         INSTALLING COMPUTER CHIPS

                                 Guy Pinte
                        New York IBM PC Users Group

     It's no real problem to install chips in your  computer.  Just  a
     little common sense and care are all that is required.

     TURN  OFF  THE  POWER.  Remove  the  PC cover and any cards,  but
     remember which slots the cards were in.  [Marking them with  tape
     and writing the location is a good idea.] An installation tool is
     not required but a chip extractor,  a special tweezers with hooks
     at the tips, is highly recommended when removing chips.

     NEVER DISCONNECT A CABLE,  INSTALL OR PULL EITHER A CARD OR  CHIP
     WITH THE POWER ON!!!

     The  three  main  problems  encountered  are  static electricity,
     broken pins, and carelessness.

     STATIC.  Do not wear synthetic clothes or  leather  soled  shoes.
     Work and stand on newspaper.  Discharge yourself before beginning
     [by  touching  the  metal chassis of the computer].  Do =not= use
     aluminum foil as a work surface!!

     PINS.  The pins on most chips are spread apart in too much  of  a
     "v" shape to align easily with the socket holes.  You may need to
     place  the  chip on its side and press on it gently,  bending the
     set of pins resting on the table inward  SLIGHTLY  to  move  them
     more  near  vertical.  Do  this one chip at a time as you install
     them into the sockets.  [Learning to install chips  without  this
     bending is strongly recommended -- it =can= be done.]

     Each  chip has a "U" shaped notch at one end.  This is important!
     This notch should match up with a similar mark on the  socket  or
     you  may  have to use other chips of the same type [on the board]
     as a guide.  Set each chip into its socket  GENTLY  and  push  it
     firmly  in  with  both  thumbs.  DO NOT RUSH.  [Installing a chip
     backwards may be harmful to its health when the power  is  turned
     on.]

                      NOTCH


     After  the  chips  are  installed,  you  will need to set the dip
     Fidonews                     Page 15                  28 Jul 1986


     switches if you are adding memory chips.  There  are  two  switch
     units  on  the  PC and one on the XT.  Positions 1-4 of switch #2
     reflect the total memory of all the installed memory on  the  PC.
     The  single  switch unit on the XT reflects only the total on the
     system board and does not deal with expansion card  memory.  Some
     switches  'slide'  while  others  'rock'.  Consult  the  Guide to
     Operations manual or expansion card documentation for the  proper
     switch settings. [But read it BEFORE all else fails.]

     Note:  Rocker  settings are not always intuitive.  The active end
     is pushed down (use a ball point  pen).  However,  some  diagrams
     show  the  raised end of the rocker as black.  Black in this case
     is  the  'other  end'.   Confusing?   Beware  of   illustrations.
     Compare the illustration for the pre-upgrade settings to what you
     had before,  this will help you determine whether a switch should
     be down or up in the illustration.

     Some expansion cards have  switches  to  'switch  in'  individual
     banks  of  memory  as  needed.  This  should not be confused with
     setting the starting address of the card which is  usually  equal
     to  the amount of memory on the system board.  Some cards require
     to be told the total memory on the card itself.

     Now,  reinstall the cards,  insert DOS in drive A and turn on the
     power.  It will take longer than you are accustomed to.

     Run CHKDSK and note the total memory at the bottom of the screen.
     this  should  be  your new total memory.  If it is not,  then the
     switches are set incorrectly.

     If  the memory failed the diagnostic and gave an error message on
     the screen,  you may have a bad chip.  This is rare but  it  does
     happen.  If  you  have  a  special diagnostic that can locate the
     chip use it.

     The first step is to locate the row of chips with the bad one(s).
     POWER OFF.  Set the memory switches to the  next  lower  64K  and
     power  on again.  If the diagnostic passes,  then the bad chip is
     in the last 64K.  If it does not pass,  reduce the memory (by the
     switches) by another 64K etc. until the row harboring the culprit
     is isolated.

     Note:  Since  the  XT  switches  do  not deal with expansion card
     memory and therefore the total memory, a different technique will
     have to be  used.  If  the  card  allows  the  switching  out  of
     individual  memory  banks,  use  them.  Otherwise you may have to
     remove chips a row at a time until the fault goes away.

     Once the row has been isolated,  pull a chip from a good row  and
     set it aside.  Pull a chip from the bad row and install it in the
     good  row.  Repeat  until  you  get a failure.  Remember when you
     pull and install each chip Power Down first.  There could be more
     than one bad chip.

     After you have tried all the chips from the bad row and not found
     a bad one,  things may be okay.  If a chip was not fully  seated,
     Fidonews                     Page 16                  28 Jul 1986


     or  if  oxidation has formed,  an undeserved error may point to a
     perfectly good chip.  When you  moved  the  chip,  you  may  have
     corrected  the fault when it was reseated.  Install the chips you
     removed from the good row and install them in the  row  that  you
     removed all the "suspect" chips from.  Rerun the diagnostics with
     all  the memory switched on again.  If all goes well,  power off,
     button up, and enjoy.

     ADDITIONAL NOTES:

     1) Not all IBM compatibles can be upgraded merely by  adding  the
        extra  RAM.  Some  may need some other addition.  For example,
        the machine I  used  required  a  proprietary  chip  from  the
        manufacturer.

     2) Some  IBM compatibles run diagnostics on power up.  One way to
        check out new chips is to swap them with  original  RAM  chips
        and  run  the diagnostics.  You may be able to find a bad chip
        this way.  Running the diagnostics overnite may help isolate a
        marginal  chip.  This  is  suggested  as  a method only if you
        cannot isolate a new RAM chip as bad any  other  way.  But  be
        careful.  It  means  =carefully=  removing  chips you know are
        good.

     3) A useful tool to help installing the new chips  is  a  plastic
        (disposable)  putty  knife  available in most hardware stores.
        If it slips, it is less likely to damage the mother board.

     4) Probably the most  common  problem  in  this  process  is  the
        correct setting of the DIP switches.  For example, I thought I
        had  done  everything  right,  but  on  first  power-up I lost
        graphics capability and could only address 256k.  I was SURE I
        had done everything right.  But it  was  a  matter  of  having
        flipped  the  wrong  DIP  switch.  Not  all compatibles follow
        IBM's standards in which switches do what.  IF ALL ELSE FAILS,
        TRY READING YOUR OPERATING MANUAL.

                      THE ALL-IMPORTANT "HUMAN FACTOR"


          When you have completed the second phase of your research --
     and have compiled a substantial list of firms that seem likely to
     have current suitable opportunities (including  names  of  hiring
     officials   whenever   possible)  --  then  you  must  prepare  a
     customized cover letter for each firm  and  mail  this,  together
     with  a  copy  of  your resume,  to each company.  Note that,  in
     preparing your cover letter it is extremely valuable if  you  can
     cite  a  referral  or  other  contact  within the firm.  In fact,
     anything you can do to personalize your  application  --  thereby
     separating  it from the daily tide of anonymous applications most
     large firms must deal with -- will greatly help your  chances  of
     being called in for an interview.  Even if you don't know someone
     inside the firm, you may have made some indirect contact with the
     firm or industry that can be mentioned;  for example you may have
     attended a lecture or meeting where a company official  presided;
     mention  this  as  having sparked your interest in the firm.  Use
     your imagination:  try to find some way of relating yourself in a
     personal  way  to  the  hiring  official,   his  department,  his
     occupation, his firm, or his industry.

          This  latter  point  suggests  the  great  importance   that
     virtually all employers attach to dealing with the applicant AS A
     PERSON.  Employers,  like all human beings,  tend to be favorably
     disposed to people who share their own interests and views.  Your
     cover letter is only one of many ways you can create a  favorable
     personal  reaction from an employer.  Another way -- probably the
     best way -- is by talking directly with him  (or  her),  or  with
     someone  he  works  with.  Of  course,  you  may  find a personal
     conversation very  difficult  to  arrange,  even  via  telephone.
     Still  you  should  be keenly aware of the importance of personal
     contact with prospective employers.  Whenever possible, put aside
     your resume and talk as often as you can, as much as you can,  to
     anyone  in the industry.  Discuss the industry,  the company,  or
     even  yourself.   For  usually,   it's  the   "human-factor"   --
     identifying  yourself  to  the  employer as an individual -- that
     makes  the  difference.   Whether  you  call  this  "networking,"
     "informational  interviewing," or simply "an informed approach to
     job hunting" it is the best way known to land the  job  you  want
     and deserve.

     software  and  other  goodies,  and that's "archived" size!  When
     unpacked,  you get approximately 28 megabytes worth of all  kinds
     of  software,  from text editors to games to unprotection schemes
     to communications programs, compilers, interpreters, etc...  Over
     55 DS/DD diskettes!!

     This collection is the result of more than 15 months of intensive
     downloads  from  just  about 150 or more BBS's and other sources,
     all of which have been examined,  indexed and archived  for  your
     convenience.  Starting  a  Bulletin Board System?  Want to add on
     to your software base without spending thousands of dollars? This
     is the answer!!!

     postal money order or company purchase order) to:

     Note:  No  profit  is  made  from  the  sale of the Public Domain

     running a  BBS  to  receive  file  submissions,  and  inspecting,
     cataloguing, archiving and maintaining the files.  Obtaining this
     software yourself through the use of  a  computer  with  a  modem
     using  commercial phone access would cost you much more than what
     we charge for the service...

     Please specify what type of format you would like the disks to be
     prepared on.  The following choices are available:
           - IBM PC-DOS Backup utility

     expensive  disks).  There  are  no  shipping or handling charges.
     California residents add 6% tax.

     For each sale, $10 will go to the FidoNet Administrators.

     electronic mail system.

     SEAdog  is  a  PC-based  electronic  mail  system  which is fully
     FidoNet compatible.  In addition  to  all  the  functionality  of
     FidoNet mail, SEAdog adds the following:

                    GENEALOGY Conference Using EchoMail

     I  am  looking  for  Fido  nodes  in  the U.S  who would  like to
     participate in  an EchoMail  conference  dedicated  to genealogy.
     This conference  would be  for the  computer genealogist  and the
     sharing of genealogical information.  Currently  we have only one
     other node in Rye, NH (132/104) and we're looking for more.

     If you are interested in carrying this conference on  your board,
     contact me via FidoMail at 143/26.

                              WATCH OUT FOR THIS

     I have just discovered that when a user logs on under
     the first name ALL and no second name he has just become
     one of the mose written to users on the board. If he has
     access to the message area (as he does on my system), he
     also has the ability to delete message to that name.
     So all of those messages that were previously written to
     ALL then this person has all the power to delete these
     messages.  I hope that this notice doesn't get to you too
     late.

                       Genealogical Computing Seminar

     The New England Historic and Genealogical Society will sponsor
     another Genealogical Computing Seminar September 20, 1986, at the
     Boston Museum of Science Computer Place.  This will be an
     opportunity to learn from qualified professionals in both
     computers and genealogy, to experiment with different
     genealogical computing software and word processing programs
     available, and to gain valuable hands-on experience under expert
     guidance.

     Familiarity with either and IBM (or IBM-compatible) or an Apple
     personal computer is necessary, and you should be in a stage in
     your genealogical research where you can benefit from
     computerization--you may need a system to organize your own data,
     or you may be working on a book for your family association.
     There will be an advanced class for those ready to try database
     programming, but the seminar is primarily designed for
     intermediate level computer genealogists.

     The costs since last year's computer seminar have risen
     dramatically, so the seminar fee has been raised accordingly, to
     $85.00 for the day.  Hotel accommodations within mass transit
     distance of the museum are available for NEHGS members at a
     discount.

     Space is limited!  For more information, or to register, call or
