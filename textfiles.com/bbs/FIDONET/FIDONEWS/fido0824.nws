A smorgasbord of possibilities ...
by Tom Jennings

This editorial is kinda long, so I've broken it into sections:

I MADE A MISTEAK: FidoNews compression method
UNPLEASANT DIGRESSION: Content, policy, censorship in FidoNews
BACK TO FIDONEWS: Suggestions to authors on content
MY TRAVEL PLANS: I'll be out of town for 6 weeks
PROGRAM VERSION LIST: It should be split off as a separate project
NEW SECTIONS: ... added to FidoNews
UNFINISHED PROJECTS: Things we need in FidoNews


----------------
I MADE A MISTEAK:

Between taking over a new, complex system on short notice, and not
asking the right questions, I managed to create FidoNews in a
compression format that a signifigant portion of the net could not
decompress. My sincere apologies! It was definitely not intentional.

Starting with this issue, FidoNews will again be compressed in the
near-universal ARC format. Again, my apologies to all the non-MSDOS
systems out there.

(And oooh are we touchy -- with few exceptions, I was informed of
my mistake by being accused of all sorts of conspiratorial wrong
doing, which is very exciting, but unfortunately wrong. "Thank you"
to the two or three who informed me in a civilized manner.)


---------------------
UNPLEASANT DIGRESSION:

This will be the only time I'll directly address this, so it's OK to
read.

I'm getting lots of complaints regarding Steve Winter's articles. Some
were simply flames that didn't qualify as articles except the filename
convention. I think it's funny (and depressing in oh so many ways)
that I'm the one defending a fundie christian's writings. Does it mean
I like it or agree with him? Nope. I might even have rude things to
say about it, if I wasn't editor of this rag (sic). (You think that's
contradictory? Maybe you should find out what an editor is for.)

The "reasonable" rules you would use to strike his writings from
FidoNews are the same ones that you'd use to strike anything else that
some person or group complaining loud enough didn't like. The proposed
"rules" received in the mail would turn FidoNews into a somewhat less
dry version of COMPUTERWORLD or DATAMATION.

Policies involving people's personal/social aspects should be
determined by setting very broad limits of acceptable behavior, not by
defining a "norm" and making things adhere to it. (I agree that the
stuff in question is an extreme.) It's a slippery slope -- if by
policy you eliminate "extreme stuff", you'll find that there were
things less-extreme that are now under scrutiny; and so on ad
infinitum. A dangerous long-term policy for a vehicle that changes
hands periodically. We are setting precedent here for the future.

Fact: I am not going to give in to censorious types (even though you
insist you are not, you are).

                        * * * * *

I found this Letter to the Editor in the S.F. Bay Guardian, a weekly
newspaper in the Bay Area.

[Regarding the inclusion of a weekly horoscope column in the S.F. Bay
Guardian)

"[...]

"Some people no doubt read them because they know good advice when
they see it, and of course, a few really believe. A lot more, like me,
just think they're fun -- like fortune cookies.

"Then there are the few tiresome cranks who object, wanting to censor
our newspapers. I hope you simply ignore them.

"These people never see how they damage their own cause. They come
across as anti-free speech, generate sympathy for those they would
censor, make it easy to dismiss them as dogmatists pushing a different
belief system, don't change any minds, and worst of all, implicitly
suggest they can only address the matter by gagging the opposition."

                                                          Rick Moen
                                       Secretary, Bay Area Skeptics

Rick, by the way, happens to be FidoNet 1:125/41.

I don't believe in a right to convenience. "Convenience" has become
the unspoken universal goal for Middle America; we'll give up anything
for it, even basic rights, let any power monger who comes along make
any decision for us as long as it's convenient in the short term.
Sorry, not from me.

Enough said on this subject. Which brings me to what was originally my
FIRST item:


----------------
BACK TO FIDONEWS:

FidoNews 8-24                  Page 3                      17 Jun 1991


I request that authors try to limit themselves to issues related to
communications. FidoNet is a communications medium, with which we can
discuss anything that gives us pleasure or fills a need. FidoNews is
sort of a meta-FidoNet, a thing about a thing. It should relate to the
FidoNet as a whole, which of course means it will contain things from
the FidoNet's members, which of course may be on any subject.

FidoNews is of limited size and scope. Things within it should somehow
relate to communications, the closer to the workings of FidoNet the
better, but obviously anything related to computer networking, legal
and ethical issues, technologies, etc are especially welcome.

To reiterate, the written policy has not changed; FidoNews will
continue to run most everything received. However I request that you
try to keep to issues related to *communicating* electronically.

FidoNews will change. It will take time. Have patience. Are you
beginning to see the pattern yet? I will gladly spell out my intent
and goals and methods in as much detail as I have them -- but for now
I'll just let you think this over.

Which brings me to the next item:


---------------
MY TRAVEL PLANS:

I will be out of town by the time you read this, and will not return
until the last week of July. Yup, about 6 weeks (possibly less).
Camping in the deserts of New Mexico, somewhat aimlessly, though I'll
visit friends in Albuquerque and Santa Fe. Driving my propane-powered
white 1963 Rambler Classic 550 Cross Country Station Wagon [whew],
probably the only one about, with Fornicalia license plates that say
"FIDONET". Say hi if you see me, and be warned if you shoot at me I
may shoot back (I shoot 3-gun combat competition regularly so watch
out).

I've been planning this trip since last year. The editorship came up
at the last minute, so this conflict couldn't be helped. Tim Pozar
will be taking over in the mean time. He may be less willing to put up
with flaming so be warned :-)

Probably he will place tempests in teapots on the back burner until I
return. I'll probably call in to see how things are going (I think I
have production automated) and possibly editorialize from afar, as
I'll be taking my Tandy 200 with me. (I wrote a terminal program with
CRC XMODEM in 8085 assembly language; about 200 more instructions and
I'll have an FSC-0001 packeter for it. Probably will be the smallest
FidoNet interface (1800 bytes) around!) But I'm off subject here.

--------------------
PROGRAM VERSION LIST:

A list of FidoNet utility versions appears in the back of every
FidoNews. It has become an important and popular feature of FidoNews.
(I think Vince Perriello (the previous editor) came up with it.)

To make a long story short -- the utility-version-list has become a
project unto itself. Editing FidoNews is enough work by itself. It
needs to be done by someone else, and shipped here for inclusion in
FidoNews. FidoNews will run the most recently-received version; when
changes are made, I'll replace the old file with the new.

I will warn you now, it's a responsibility, and needs to be taken
seriously. Whoever does it will receive a dozen or more messages a
week, and you will need to edit the FIDONEWS.VER file accordingly (and
request additional information where required, etc) and mail a copy
here for inclusion.

It's complicated by the fact that I'll be out of town. Think about it
however in the mean time.


------------------------
NEW SECTIONS IN FIDONEWS:

    Date: Sun, 09 Jun 91 18:23:38 pdt
    From: Bob.Davis@f114.n106.z1.FIDONET.ORG (Bob Davis)
    Subject: Fidonews
    To: kumr!pozar

    Dean Lachan told me you are involved in reworking the
    layout of Fidonews. We've been having a lively discussion
    in ZEC conference on a number of topics, among which is the
    viability of Fidonews as a communications medium of official
    news in Fidonet.

    Fidonews has historically been filled with a wide range
    of diatribe that causes a lot of people to skip it. Some
    have said that you can look in the table of contents and
    figure out what's important. I disagree. Look at the TOC for
    Fidonews.817. Its not obvious that Tony published the Backbone
    Procedures in there.

    May I suggest that future Fidonews incorporate a section or
    chapter devoted strictly to fidonet business commmunication? It
    would be clearly labeled as FIDONET BUSINESS or something
    similar and not include any political comment or rebuttal.

    [...]

You've got it -- a new section in FidoNews called "FidoNet News".

"FidoNet News" contains only items pertaining to technical and policy
issues of operating FidoNet -- technical standards, policy changes,
vote results, that sort of thing. This section will appear even when
empty -- to allow scanning the Table of Contents for net-related news
and facts.


-------------------
UNFINISHED PROJECTS:

There are a number of things I want to start or change in FidoNews.
Since I won't get to do them until I return, I'll list them here so
you can think about them ahead of time.

ABSTRACTS: Called "reviews" in magazines, but they are really
"abstracts", brief descriptive mentions of other publications,
electronic and otherwise, of potential interest to FidoNews readers --
EFF's Effector, BOARDWATCH Magazine, Computer Underground Digest, and
such like. What they cover, how to get, publication schedule, etc,
rather than pass judgment good vs. bad (you're all grown up kids and
can make your own decisions on that).

FIDOCON: FidoCon '91 is about to happen -- I will be there, but I'm
only one person, so -- we need reporters!!! Don't try to cover it all,
just pick one thing and write even just one or two paragraphs. You'd
be surprised how interesting and effective VERY SHORT reports are! It
would be great to have a few dozen 2 - 3 paragraph reports on things
happening at FidoCon, rather than a few long overviews. Don't worry
about duplication; two people covering the same event can be
interesting. Don't worry about your writing, I'm not your grade school
english teacher -- it's content that counts!

Bye! Have a good trip! (hey, that's your line...)

This is the official report by the Organizing Committee of the 2nd Asian
BBS Sysops' Conference held in Taipei, Taiwan, in June, 1991.

          The 2nd Asian BBS Sysops' Conference in Taipei, 1991
          ----------------------------------------------------
                     Date: June 12, 1991
                     By: Yoshi Mikami, representing the Organizing
                         Committee, Taipei, c/o FidoNet 6:720/13

The 2nd Asian BBS Sysops' Conference was held on Saturday, June 8, 1991,
in Taipei, Taiwan, ROC, at the Taipei Office of Tsing Hua University.
Sixty-six people registered themselves as participants of the
conference:  50 from Taiwan, 9 from Japan, 6 from Korea and one from
Hongkong.  Several jounalists were covering the conference, as they were
expected to write about this conference in the computer and BBS
magazines in Japan, Korea and Taiwan, just like last year.  These and
other unregistered participants made the total number of attendees close
to 90.

Honlin Lue of the Organizing Committee kicked off the meeting at 1:45 PM
with the explanation in Chinese (*) of the objective of the conference:
free exchange of the information and experience of using computers to
communicate with the people of the world.  Honlin, Jimmy Tsai and Yoshi
Mikami were the moderators of this year's conference.  The abstracts of
all speakers were available in both hard copy and soft copy formats.
This year's organizing committee consisted of Mathew Hsia, Bandit Ho and
Tad Sekineh as well as the people mentioned in this paragraph.
Toshiyuki Omi, Soon Pack Park and Jim Lin were the Country Coordinators
for Japan, Korea and Taiwan, respectively.

(*) Jimmy had set up two mini-FM transmitters to provide simultaneous
Chinese/English and Japanese/English translations for the audience to
hear via their portable FM radios.  The translation team, headed by Tad
Sekineh, consisted of Alexandre Chang, Franke Ojeda and Tad himself.
Our conference policy was to let the speakers use the language that they
feel comfortable with.

Shuichi Fujita first spoke of the BBS Scene in Japan.  He covered the
broad areas of both amateur BBSes and commercial networks (NIFTY-Serve,
PC-VAN, etc.), the statistical data by region of the amateur BBSes, the
most frequently used BBS host programs, and his experience of
participating in bringing up the International Fido Network in Japan
last year.  Joji Sawai added his comments about the PC Tokyo (PCT) User
FidoNews 8-24                  Page 13                     17 Jun 1991


Group activities and distributed the PCT Newslatters.

Sang Kil Lee of Korea then described the Korean BBS Scene.  Citing a
recent Sysops' meeting sponsored by POS-Serve (starting its service
later this summer under license from NIFTY-Serve) in Seoul, he mentioned
that they were excited over a possibility of coordinating a future Asian
BBS Sysops' conference in Korea.  His speech and abstract gave the
audience a detailed look at the use of computers by the Korean people.

Ray Tracy of Taiwan as a third speaker made a powerful speech about the
Taiwan BBS Scene in Chinese.  He introduced the wide use of FidoNet
here, the multiplicity of various echo boards and TTN-Serve, Taiwan's
first commercial system.  Tracy spoke of Taiwan's BITNET, UUCP
connection and radio packet network also.  It was a good, comprehensive
analysis of the Taiwan network status.

One-hour intermission from 3:00 PM was meant for the participants to
freely meet with each other.  Books and magazines on BBSing from Taiwan
and Japan were displayed on the side tables inside the conference hall.
It was also a "Sing Along" time for those who cared to participate.  A
children's song, originally from Germany ("Hanschen klein, Hanschen
klein, ..."), was sung in Japanese ("Butterfly, butterfly, stop by the
rape flowers!  ..."), in Chinese ("Buzzy bee, buzzy bee, ...") and in
Korean (it sounded more like a cicada than a bufferfly or buzzy bee).
China's Tang Dynasty 5- and 7-character line poems ("Spring slumber
cannot be awaken by the dawn" and "The moon has fallen, the crows have
become inactive and the sky is full of frost") were also recited and
sung by the volunteers.

Those who had brought notebook PCs with them demonstrated the Chinese,
Japanese and Korean systems that were placed in one computer.
Paticipants were surprised to get donations:  "2nd Asian BBS Sysops'
Conference" yellow vests by Actyiu Yiu, "Chinese poem reciting" cassette
tapes by Claude Shen, and "I Love Taipei" bumper stickers from IBM
Taiwan.

The second half of the BBS conference started at 4:00 PM.  From the
other Asian countries and regions, Daniel Mok of Hongkong and Charlie
McDermott of Okinawa spoke of their experiences in their respective
areas.  Hongkong and Okinawa are Taiwan's dearest neighbors, important
for international communi- cation links.

Julie Chu of Taiwan was the only female speaker of the day.  Julie
talked enthusiastically about her experience of running a Fido BBS in
Taipei since last year.  She expects more female users and sysops to
join the BBSing world in the future.  There were about ten female
participants in the conference.

There apparently was ample interest among the Korean commercial BBS
operators to participate in this conference.  Dong Soo Lee of the Korea
Economic Daily's KETEL and Byung Gyu Chung of DACOM's PC-Serve gave a
15-minute talk each about their services.  There were a great deal of
technical questions asked of the Korean personal computers and answered.
Completion (Wansung) vs.  combination (Johab) methods of representing
Korean Hangeul characters, 2-bul vs.  3-bul types of keyboards, Iyagi
and Nambuktongil ("Unity of South and North") terminal emulator
FidoNews 8-24                  Page 14                     17 Jun 1991


programs, etc., were all discussed.

Toshiyuki Omi made closing remarks of the conference in Japanese,
thanking the participants and the Organizing Committee members.  Our
Asian countries using the double-byte character sets are entering an
interesting period of time, with the availability of ETen in Taiwan,
DOS/V in Japan and Saedong Gilshi in Korea.  We are now more interested
in each other's activities.  A suggestion of having the next meeting in
Korea is a good sign of having more people interested in what we know we
do best:  helping others to communicate with the people of the world.

After the formal part of the conference was over, a free discussion was
held regarding the next conference.  Several opinions were expressed
openly, including the desires to have the next meeting in Korea, to keep
the June conference in Taipei (because of the COMPUTEX Taipei computer
show) and to hold a fall meeting elsewhere, etc.  A hesitency was
noticed among the Korean participants because they were not sure at this
time if a good organizing committee of several interested people can be
set up in Seoul, while the names of the BBS conference participants from
Korea entirely changed from last year to this year.  The Japanese
participants seemed to be more interested in travelling to other
countries than holding the BBS conference in Japan.

For those who had paid for dinner, there were all kinds of opinion and
business card exchanges, and private meetings during the 6:00-8:00 PM
dinner party time.  The late afternoon squall, typical of the Taipei
weather, had almost stopped for all participants to take taxis or busses
to go back to their hotels or homes, in the warm summer evening.  It was
again a good BBS conference in Taipei for the Asian sysops, full of fun.

                      By Vince...and Thanks

Thanks for the memories Vince...I think you've done a excellent
job riding herd on FIDONEWS.

In thinking back over the time you discussed, we've had 3 ZC's,
we are working on our 3rd ZEC, P4 has been implemented, I tempo
rarily removed SYSOP from the domain of FidoNet for FidoNet's *C
conference rules violation, until an equitable agreement could be
worked out.

I've taken a group of 5 adult oriented local echoes, and parlayed
them into a fully blown private network with links listed in 8
countries, and well over 300 discreet nodes. Sometimes I wonder
how it keeps going.

FidoNews 8-24                  Page 15                     17 Jun 1991


We've seen the demise of IFNA, something I was not very happy
over. Mostly because of the apathy involved in its demise. IFNA
had some really good things it could have done for FidoNet and
Networking in general had it been allowed to do them.

We've seen Echopol 1 abandoned, but still technically enforced,
and then finally thrust upon us by command. We've seen Gateway
Poll put in place by dictatorial edict. And in the same FidoNews
it was violated by the same person who is today our ZEC.

We've seen elections that would make the Democrats and Republi
cans green with envy! Especially because they didn't think anyone
could get any dirtier at it that they could.

I hadn't realized that there was even a draft of WorldPol ready,
let alone an election was being held on it. I've tried to get out
of main-stream FidoNet Politics because of health and finances.
But, even trying to stay out, it seems that it's impossible. For
example I've just picked up FidoNews 821. Today is June 10.

I like alot of what I seen in WorldPol. I have a couple of points
of contention with it. One is what about a part of policy for
"minor" sysops? I'm not advocating not allowing them in, but I am
definitely advocating some sort of parental responsibility
clause, and possibly agreement. I've seen several networks nearly
taken apart by kids with no parental supervision.

Speaking of kids, P4 pushed for the removal of the PVT systems,
and for them to either go to points, or become fully listed
nodes. I see that now the BACKBONE is getting ready to declare
the Off-Line readers that were developed to help with this are
about to become illegal. Real progress.

More on kids, last month I got a message from my 1:103 NEC stat-
ing that he knew I was linking echoes to 1:202, and that I should
not use my Zone 69 connections to 'illegally' send them fidonet
echoes, and by-pass their Echomail Cost Recovery Scheme. After
advising him that the business of Adult Links was not the busi
ness of the Net 103 NEC, I demanded he show proof of his accusa
tions, or retract his statement and apologize. To date he has
done neither. At the time, I was linking Net 103 to SDS, and also
linking the NEC to several echoes. I've since talked to several
Net 202 sysops and they would also like to know more about the
Echomail Recovery Plan that they are supposed to be under.

The other part is the discrimination clause. I like alot of what
I see there. P4 gives the local networks some rights to a local
policy. This allows for variations as to how a system applies for
a node number, it allows for probably 400 different variations on
how various networks allow "minors" into them, and it allows for
variations to keep people out of local Networks.

FidoNews 8-24                  Page 16                     17 Jun 1991


For example, the use of Handles/Alias'. There is nothing in P4
the denies a person the right to use a handle and or alias. Last
summer, I got a call from our local NEC who had convinced the NC
that it was improper for a person to use a handle, and they had
removed a node from the nodelist based on the fact that one of
the CO-SYSOP's regularly used a handle, and refused to use his
real name, even though he is better known by his handle than by
his name. The system was removed from the nodelist without notice
to the SYSOP as to why or for what reason. I also discussed the
probable results of a PC against both of them if the sysop were
so inclined. The system magically reappeared in the nodelist.

I know they understand it. Shucks, I sent my NC a message on May
13th asking for both my system name and the sysop name to be
changed. I sent a follow-up message on May 28th, and I see my
system name got changed in Nodelist.158. I've just sent my NC a
note reminding him that he missed the sysop name change. It's
becoming a problem, because most people now try and contact me as
SIR DEP and not Jim Deputy.

But, it's also been a nice time. TJ are you sure you're ready for
this again?

Corresponding from a secure hiding place deep within the uncharted

Dear Reverend Visage,

Your secretary is shrieking at me concerning the small
problem with the Porsche we borrowed to deliver last night's
echomail. How were we supposed to know that the drawbridge
was up and that we would land six counties away in the
middle of a sheep pasture? I hate to tell you this, but
she's gonna be in a king hell rage when you show up again
with lanolin on your breath.


I'm sure you can remember the movie "Butch Cassidy And The
Sundance Kid". I have been reminded of that movie in the
recent past concerning the sad plight of the Commode D'Or
echo. As Butch & Sundance traversed sagebrush and mountains
they were pursued relentlessly, and they kept asking each
other: "Who *are* those guys?".

As you are well aware, we've made a few underestimations in
our time, not the least of which was the time you bet almost
our entire stuffed armadillo collection on the recent ZEC
election, but I don't think we missed hearing the speeding
train as badly as we did when the California Spam 'N Timmies
invaded the Commode D'Or echo.

Okay, so maybe using an areatag name like COMMODORE in
recognition of the fact that the afformentioned piece of
hardware was adopted as our mascot and is also the boat
anchor of serious sport fisherman everywhere. And maybe,
just maybe, if we'd been firmer with the mongol hordes who
descended on the echo and attempted to talk techie to us...
perhaps we wouldn't be in serious echomail withdrawal at the
moment.

Perhaps I wasn't paying as much attention to the messages as
I should have... and this has almost nothing at all to do
with the fact that I played AC/DC's "Thunderstruck" on the
other serial channel as I patiently waited for the cassette
deck to load the echomail into my trailing-edge technology
BBS running on the Sinclair ZX81. I saw the first couple of
messages and pondered to myself: "Who *are* these guys?" and
left it at that.

When was it that we started the Commode D'Or echo? It must
have been at least four years ago and possibly longer
because I recall you foolishly losing our entire dental
floss ranch on a silly bet concerning the longevity of disco
music. We started the echo as a local effort so that we
could discuss the more serious issues facing computer users
in the frozen tundra... the high cost of whale blubber to
keep the hard drives lubricated was a frequent topic of
debate. The echo gained a loyal following and by some act of
NEC/REC magic it found it's way onto the International
Backbone.

FidoNews 8-24                  Page 18                     17 Jun 1991


Nine months after the echo was placed on the backbone, the
very first non-local message arrived. It was from some guy
in New Jersey who quoted *everything* and appended very
little of his own. Remember how riled he got when it was
suggested that he book into the Betty Ford Clinic For The
Criminally Uninspired to cure his rampant Quotaholism? In no
time, he had marshalled more of his buddies to join the echo
and, again, I asked myself: "Who *are* these guys?"

As politely as we could, we pointed the New Jersoids to the
CBM echo where *serious* Commodore techies could do whatever
it is that consenting Commodore users do... and I really
don't wanna know. We could tell they were a repressed and
unhappy bunch when they chose to disbelieve us when we
mentioned that most of our echomail traffic was carried by
dog-teams across the frozen ice-flows.

The Commode D'Or echo took on a special meaning when one of
our parka pals actually operated a Fidonet BBS (163/227) on
his C128, using software written by himself in Basic. (Basic
is a programming language preferred by C programmers who
have learned how to count, and thus don't get confused by
line numbers...ahem.) Even Nanook's pet seal clapped her
flippers in admiration that a C128 could be browbeaten into
Fidonet mailer compliancy.

Alas (please note: not "a lass"), the universe never seems
to unfold as it should and the echo was soon invaded by the
California Spam 'N Timmies. These new participants in the
echo, if they had any reading comprehension at all, quickly
announced that it was a "Commodore" echo.

"No. No." we said "Commode D'Or... Commode D'Or... as in
Golden Toilet." but they wouldn't listen. The reared up on
thier hindpaws and *demanded* that we cease talking about
'frivolous' things immediately, or else. Now up here in the
frozen north we've always been a friendly bunch and willing
to accomodate almost anyone. (Tell Nanook that I'll return
his wife later this week.) We figured that the California
Spam 'N Timmies bunch could co-exist in the echo with us.
We'd ignore their techie-talk, and they could ignore our
exchanges about edible underwear, Caribou migrations, and
the occasional C128 Fidonet mailer test message.

One fellow, who was linked into the net via one of the
gateways, announced that he would either change the echo, or
destroy it. As usual, we didn't take him all that seriously
since he kept signing his name by appending "President,
Commodore User's Club". I mean really, a Commodore User's
Club... it is to snicker. What we missed in our good hearted
attempts to humour these fire-breathing intruders, was that
Commodore users are probably the larval stage of Amiga
users. You *know* how touchy the Amagatroids are about their
toy computers.

I guess it must have been Nanook who suggested that they
either needed to have more fibre in their diet, or at least
to get out and play on the freeway more often. Remember how
excitable everyone got that time you brought your pet skunk
to the wedding reception? Well, this situation wasn't much
different. The California Spam 'N Timmies went
hypercritical. We're talkin' major modem meltdown here. One
of them, in an effort to show us what *real* Commodore
messages looked like, cross-posted about 50 messages from
the CBM echo and then proceeded to use some words that had
something to do with an act of self-procreation. Another one
of them, a fellow who identified himself as the NC of a
Fidonet BBS, keep bleating for a ruling from the moderator.

I spoke to the moderator and his response was as laid back
as could be expected from someone whose front lawn is
covered with snow for 11 1/2 months of the year. "No
problem" he said, "The dweebs who are whining all live in
California. We'll just be patient and let continental drift
take care of them." It seemed like a wise course of action,
and hey, if an earthquake took them out earlier then that
was all the better. In an effort to make them feel welcome I
participated in their new game of cross-posting messages.
The one I chose happened to be about a yuppie-babe on a date
with some vegetables.... a completely on topic and
appropriate message for the Commode D'Or echo.

I have no idea why a paragraph such as:

 "She poured a small splash of Genadine into the juicer
followed by an over-ample dash of white rum. The pineapples
which had rested upon smooth linen napkins winked up at her.
She grasped a cherry by it's stem and gently teased the seed
from it's depths with her tongue. Using both hands, she
plunged the cherry pitter deep into a second cherry and
carefully allowed the juices to run across her wrist before
she raised her arm and sucked the delicate drops."

... could cause these people to be driven to near-apoplexy.
As they went variously insane, they also netmailed all parts
of the known Fidonet admin structure with whimpers of
outrage. I don't know about you Visage, but it strikes me
that these people must have suffered horribly as children by
being forced to remain at the supper table until they'd
finished all their vegetables. Faster than you could say
"There's a skunk in the fridge", incoming WhineMail(tm) from
*serious* *C-beings was filling my netmail directory.

"Excuse me?" I rejoined, "You want to do what?" I asked
incredulously. "You want all of us who have fun in the
Commode D'Or echo to desist?" And just for old times sake, I
asked myself: "Who *are* these guys?" I didn't worry all
that much because as far as I knew at the time, no *EC in
his right mind would blunder into an echo and try to enforce
content rules, particularly since we were breaking no laws.

FidoNews 8-24                  Page 20                     17 Jun 1991


But, and you'll be amazed by this, those *EC-beings have
suddenly gotten religion in a major way. So much religion,
in fact, that godlike powers have descended upon their able
shoulders. Some of them, and this would have *really*
impressed the crowds a coupla thousand years ago, some of
them can actually walk and chew gum at the same time. I
know, I know... we couldn't really expect any *ECs to read
the echo which they were poised to incinerate... the
comprehension levels alone would have precluded that, but
surely one of them could have asked a few questions of us?

Without the courtesy of a message entered in the echo
telling us, the echo was taken out behind the ZEC's computer
and quietly garrotted. They didn't even return the corpse
for a decent burial. I don't really fault the *EC-beings,
they're as likely to join a lynch mob as any other mortal,
but the people I just cannot understand, are the ones who
rode into the echo with their Policy4 Six-guns blazing for
no real purpose. So I guess, if I were to ask myself again,
"Who *are* these guys?", I'd have to respond that they are
humourlous savages... more inclined to destroy than to
create. They're the pioneers of a new era and their
Policy-legimitimized thuggery is making a real mess of
FidoNet.

I must go, Visage. I was due at the studio an hour ago.
"Dread Zeppelin" is doing a reggae version of "Baa Baa Black
Sheep" and I've been hired to play the tuba solo.

Just a quick note to suggest a bit of a standard when applying
the Pretty Good Privacy program described in FidoNews 823. I've
had many downloads from my system since it was mentioned and
the general consensus after viewing the project was that a magic
file name should be selected by which anyone may request of a
system its SysOps Public Key.

FidoNews 8-24                  Page 21                     17 Jun 1991


Typically, PGPKEY was suggested, with Public Key identification
of the SysOps last name, a comma, a space, and then the first
name. Of course, the identification is easilly viewed using the
-v option of PGP so that's not an important item to standardize.

MsgMstr - A Window into FidoNet

Microsoft Windows v3.0 seems to have taken the country by storm and
has become quite a viable platform for BBS operation and routine
message manipulation.  A major problem though seems to be a lack of
FidoNet specific programs that take full advantage of Windows.  Most
current programs and utilities that evolved for FidoNet were developed
before Windows was ever considered a feasible system.  Hopefully, this
situation will turn around soon and major components for FidoNet will
be released as the advantages of running in the Windows environment
become more apparent.

To help kick off this boon to the FidoNet way of operations, I have
written a message editor that should intrigue anyone interested in
switching to the GUI interface, and to some that have yet to even
consider it.

Message Master (MsgMstr) is in its infancy at version 1.21 but
contains a number of features normally found only in programs that
have been around for a number of years.  It exhibits a seasoned feel
in that it utilizes not only the standard Windows-user interface
techniques, but incorporates keystrokes that have become the standard
among most *.MSG editors such as OpMed and MsgEd -- two respected DOS-
based message editors of long standing.  If you have become dependent
upon the left/right arrow combination for message reading, then you
are looking in the right direction when considering switching to
MsgMstr.

Some of MsgMstr's most prominent features include:

-    Very simple setup operation.  Virtually effortless for those
     running BinkleyTerm.  Great for point-operation too.

-    Full zone/point addressing.

-    Complete configuration of defaults for echo/matrix/local message
     areas, path and file locations/names, Origin lines.

-    Instant mail scanning.

FidoNews 8-24                  Page 22                     17 Jun 1991


-    Group message deletion and a feature called the Copy Machine,
     which is a powerful utility for sending mass mail.

-    Easy message forward/move/copy/delete.

-    File merge with automatic text replacement.

-    Complete message editing including header info and flag settings.

-    Control of echo area high-water marks.

-    Easy and intelligent freqing/file attach/update request options.

-    Automatic special storage area to place items for archiving.

-    Quick-Access buttons for the most common operations, available at
     all times on screen.  Does not interfere with message observation
     and manipulation.

-    Complete documentation.

All of these features are provided in the standard, easy-to-use
interface that Windows 3.0 is noted for.  Utilizing menus, dialog-
boxes, buttons, and an editor with scrollbars, MsgMstr makes for a
pleasant environment to spend your time in.  Messages may be created
up to 32,000 characters in length and employ quoted lines, tear and
origin lines, ANSI or ASCII characters;  cut and paste using the
clipboard, and a whole array of interesting and useful features not
included here.

Message Master's future holds a bright light in features never before
seen in message editors.  Due to Window's flexibility, more can be
accomplished and aid the user in message manipulation than could ever
have been imagined in DOS-based programs.  Plans are in place to add
even more features that take advantage of this flexibility.

MsgMstr is a formidable editor and very easy to use.  It makes reading
a 1000 messages a joy, not a task.  In its current configuration, it
has the features expected of any message editor for use in FidoNet. As
I've demonsrated here, it holds much more.  Just imagine what it will
be once it has matured.

Draft FidoNet Election Policy                Revision: 31-Mar-91
Luke Kolin, 1:250/714@fidonet.org

 As a recognition that FidoNet is based on democratic principles, the
positions of the NC and RC shall be made elective. The following is an
election policy that intends to fulfill the democratic intent of
FidoNet.

1) Glossary of Terms

"Elected Officer"  Any elected NC or RC.

"Immediate         The administrator one level higher in the FidoNet
 Superior"         hierarchy. For example, an NC's immediate superior
                   would be the RC, a ZC's would be the IC.

"Returning System" The equivelant of Chief Electoral Officer. It is
                   the sysop of this system who will post notices
                   advising eligible sysops as to who is running and
                   the close of the election, will count the ballots
                   and announce a winner.

"Semi-Secret       This is a ballot where a voter's choice is known
      Ballot"      only by the returning system, and by any routing
                   systems that the returning officer may designate.
                   A voter sends his ballot in with a password. At
                   the close of the election, the returning system
                   will post a list of passwords and the votes asso-
                   ciated with them. Voters may then check to see
                   that their password and votes have been received.

FidoNews 8-24                  Page 33                     17 Jun 1991

 b) An elected officer who has resigned may appoint another sysop to
    act in his stead during the election; however, this interim officer
    must be ratified by the interim officer's immediate superior. He
    may     act as a returning system, as outlined in sections 1c and d.

 c) Within three (3) days of this occurring, a formal call of election
    must be given by the immediate superior of the position that shall
    be voted upon, stating:

        i) The date of the election;
       ii) The name of the returning system.

Preface:  The purpose of my writings here is not to necessarily
"convert" or hassle anyone who is content in their current
lifestyle or religion;  but rather, to show what the real Biblical
criteria for Christianity is and thereby expose those who are
conning others.  Whether they are conning people financially or
socially, false preachers and false Christians are doing great harm
to their fellow man.
Just a basic elementary Bible knowledge could keep current and future
"Jim & Tammy" types from conning anyone or stealing a penny (they
weren't even teaching the real Bible message, EVER).

           The 'Re-Birth of water' IS Jesus name baptism.

I hope to herein expose one of the major lies that false preachers
are teaching these days.  If I seem emotional, it's just that I hate
to see people being conned. In John 3:5, Jesus told a full grown man
that he needed to be born again of a spiritual birth which consisted
of water and spirit. (notice two distinct elements WATER and SPIRIT).

Satan has many misinformed, and some knowingly deceiving false
preachers that teach that the "birth of the water" refers to a man's
physical birth (since there is a watery fluid involved at birth).
That teaching is one of the cheapest, cop out, deceptions in Satan's
arsenal to deceive people about the IMPORTANCE of baptism.

John 3:5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a
man be born of water and [of] the Spirit, he cannot enter into the
kingdom of God.

Notice that Jesus was declaring what a MAN had to do (not a baby),
and that Jesus was referring to a RE-BIRTH; being BORN AGAIN.  He
could not have been referring to the fluids of a baby's birth.  He
was telling a grown MAN how to be BORN AGAIN.  Oh, it sounds real
convincing to look at it as "physical birth", unless you consider
that he was talking to a grown MAN telling him how to be RE-BORN.

If that isn't enough to convince you, then just look at how WATER
and SPIRIT are BOTH elements in the plan of salvation that was
preached by Peter at the beginning of the new testament church:

Acts 2:38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every
one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins,
and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.

According to the Bible, Jesus name Baptism is what washes away sins,
(remission of sins).  Let's notice carefully this next verse:

Acts 22:16 And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and
wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.

Then, if you are still not convinced let's look at another verse that
Jesus spoke (and I certainly pray that you will not suggest that a
non-believer would even consider Jesus name water baptism).

Mark 16:16 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he
that believeth not shall be damned.

Seek how the same God that said Water was part of the RE-BIRTH also
declared "and is baptized",  how could the Bible be any clearer?

Remember, Jesus was talking to a GROWN MAN telling him about a
RE-BIRTH, and, as a matter of fact, babies are born IN water,
NOT 'OF' Water.. Don't be Deceived.

IIII  deplore and condemn such programs as EDMEESE and EXCLUDE, which
 II   nukes or otherwise removes or restricts =LOCAL= message traffic on
IIII  a BBS. It is my opinion that when a user sends or posts a message,
      it "should" be available for the rest of the users to view. Of
course what messages exists on a SysOps' BBS is her / his business; they
are quite autarchic; what messages they choose not to post for THAT NODE'S
users is their choice. The other scenario, where a SysOp might remove
=Echo Mail= is, of course, immoral, unethical, and should be dealt
swiftly and sternly by the FidoNet hierarchy; it is not the lone
SysOp's right, let alone "duty," to censor material destined for other
nodes without DAMN GOOD reason (also just my opinion-- not FidoLaw (tm)
"yet"). Fortunately, the cases of the later have been few.

    That said (and I hope clearly), I also applaud the new editor of
FidoNews, Tom Jennings, for choosing to publish "all" articles that are
submitted (within very broad specifications, most being technical and
not political--- thank Goddess!).

    Which is why I also applaud Jenning's publications of Steve
Winter's occult diatribes (and in the case of FNews 8-23, Winter's
paranoid tirade concerning "religious persecutions"). One person's
"spreading the word(s)" is another person's "excessively annoying
behavior," and Tom wisely left it up to us, the readers, to decide
which is which.

FidoNews 8-24                  Page 39                     17 Jun 1991


    He also leaves it up to the System Operators to pay good money to
spread Winter's occultism, even when it is against their ethical and
moral principles.

    Take for an instance the article on "speaking in tongues," which
I'm very sure 96% of the system operators who had to foot the bill
spreading such sophistic, irrational tripe would rather avoid. I could
choose to be almost as annoying as Winter and post some facts about
glossolalia, and how studies demonstrate that such speakers are
actually speaking their native languages modified only by severe
guttural stops, and in passing note the fact that many people "speak in
tongues" when they orgasm; but then it may be just as excessively
annoying as Winter's occult harangues.

    Which makes me wonder something. Since Winter is the moderator of a
Christian occultism echo, which presumably is available to all
interested parties--- why does he subject his occultism on those who
have no interest in it? Surely if someone were interested, one would
just get the echo.

    I again applaud the policy of FidoNews publishing "everything." I
do not wish to see this policy change, even though this means Steve
Winter will probably continue burdening us with his vivid
hallucinations and public bible masturbations. Please file these
comments from me under "food for thought."

    To summarize. Censorship is "wrong" in my opinion. And yet it is
also "wrong" to have several thousand system operators ship material
around that they feel is against their principles. We have a stake in
promoting rational, logical thinking, and yet we also have a stake in
allowing illogical, irrational thinkers like Winter to speak as they
please. This right is a two-edges sword, that must cut both ways.

    Do you object to Steve Winter's occult hysteria in FidoNews? Send
a letter to HIM instead of the editor, complaining. It is Winter's job
to restrain his fevered rants, not Ton Jennings' job to censor them.

Speaking In Verse: Proposed change to editorial policy in
                   regards to articles of questionable
                   merit to FidoNews.

Brennan O'Brien
Sysop: Palomar's Halo BBS  1:105/302   (503)641-9476

        I've been reading FNews for about a year now, off amd
on.  Usually, I don't have any guff with anything that is said,
but there was an article in Fnews823 that really got to me.

FidoNews 8-24                  Page 40                     17 Jun 1991


        It is my personal belief that FidoNews is one of the
most useful means of transmitting data "from above" to "the
masses" that is available to us.  It serves as an information
piece, a forum, and a platform to ballon new policies.

        FNews823 was filled with useful commentary and
discussion, as usual.  There was, however, one piece that did
bother me.  The article by Steve Winters in Re: Speaking in
Tounges.  I believe firmly in religious freedom of expression,
in the correct place.  There was no part of the article that I
could find that was of any value in regards to FidoNet as a
community and technology  (Sidebar:  Not to say that the
article lacked any value, just not that which I felt contributed
to the knowledge of FidoNet operators in regards to our State
of The Net.).

        I would ask formally that the editors loosely examine
articles for relevence to FidoNet as a whole.  I don't expect
FNews to become a forum for debate of topics that don't effect
the operations or future of FidoNet.  There are places aplenty
in modemland and FidoNet to take up these discussions (Religion,
Sexual Affinity, Abortion, and Politics to name a few).  Fnews
CERTAINLY does not need to deal with these issues in order to
insure proper coverage.

        I say loosely examine the articles because there are
many that surely come in that have limited merit.  Essentially,
I am requesting a clarification be made towards an article
with LIMITED apparent merit and NO apparent merit.  This
distinction is much like that of "excessively annoying" in that
it is difficult to codify.  But, there are some obvious
guidelines:

        Topics related to telecommunications, FidoNet, and the
history and future thereof, including the social, cultural,
economic and political dynamics of modeming are always of
reasonable merit.

        Topics related to "Adventures in Modemland", inclusive
of troubles, difficulties, heartwarming moments, etc. are of
reasonable merit.

        Topics related to ethics, mores, behavior and other
aspects of psychology and sociology, when related to
telecommunications/FidoNet, are of reasonable merit.

        Topics which are not related to (except by a stretch of
the imagination) any of the above qualifiers are to be
considered without merit, and their publication may be
restricted at the decision of the FNews editor(s).

FidoNews 8-24                  Page 41                     17 Jun 1991


        Now, you may be asking why I want to make this sort of
distinction.  Do I want to "BAN" articles such as "Speaking"
from Fido?  No.  Not at all.  What I do want is a place where I
can read the "What's Going On" stuff WITHOUT having to read the
"hard moral issues" of religion, politics, abortion, etc.  There
are a mass of places on my BBS, on other BBS', and on FidoNet in
general, where I can CHOOSE to go someplace and read these hard
hitting issues.  Please, give me a place where I don't have to.

                          PUBLIC APOLOGY

I apologize to anyone who has been inconvenienced by an emergency
change in my phone number.  The nodelist has not been updated,
but my phone number has been changed.  At the same time that this
happened, I advertised that you can call my system and file
request ICDM for info on the ICDM Network.  Well, since the
nodelist is incorrect, you can't file request.  (You can Host-
Route a netmail, though, direct to 352/0).  If you desire to file
request info, you may want to override the nodelist for this
week.  The old number for 1:352/777 is 1-206-666-9113.  The new
number is 1-206-866-3621.

In case you do not know what info I am refering to, here is a
summary:

               Notice:  Invitation to Carry ICDM Net

There has begun a new, auxiliary network, which has as a purpose
the linking of persons interested in religion.  This is a
specialized Network, aimed at bridging cultures, and enlightening
participants on the faiths of others.

It is open to any board that is FidoNet compatible.  It is
compiled as a separate Zone (77), so your software must be Zone
aware.  It is open to any faith, any person, regardless of sex,
creed, color, etc. etc.

The HOST is Tomas Hood, 1:352/777, the Zone 77 Co-ordinator.
There may be connections close to you, and as we grow, there will
surely be!

For more information, send netmail to 1:352/777, and request ICDM,
which is an information packet.

Thanks for your interest and we look forward to hearing from you.
And, thanks for understanding the problem with my phone number
chages.

                    FINEARTS ECHO NOW AVAILABLE!

FINEARTS is a conference for anyone who enjoys the Fine Arts,
from Theatre to Poetry, Painting or Sculpure, and all in between.
This is for the person who performs, or simply enjoys.  This is
an open conference.  We pass on film festival info, talk about
Longfellow, or discuss oil painting.  Join us!

It is, at present, a non-backbone Echo Hosted and Moderated by
Tomas Hood [1:352/777].  Initial links will be provided from this
system to any and all who request same.  However, it is about to
become part of Region 17's available echoes.  If there is enough
of a demand, it can possibly be negotiated onto the backbone.

The Echo is open to anyone who desires to discuss the topic of
the Fine Arts.

A sample of the first few messages and the statement of purpose
of the Echo is available as FNART (majyk name for FNART.ARJ)
from this system anytime.  The ARJ archive utility is also
available as "ARJ," if you wish to get an idea of whether to
commit disk space to the Echo.

I hope you will join us or ask your Sysop to request a link
via Netmail to 1:352/777.

Cheers!
Tomas Hood
