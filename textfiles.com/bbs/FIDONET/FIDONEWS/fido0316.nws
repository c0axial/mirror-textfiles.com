     Jim Butterfield
                              Spaghetti Coding

             I recently received a letter from  Syd  Bolton,  who  was
     most  enthusiastic  about  "free-form" programming.  You know the
     sort of thing -- the first step is to turn the computer  on.  The
     next is to write a dozen lines or so; after that, decide what you
     want to do.  Under no circumstances is any planning to take place
     before   switching  on,   and  work  with  pencil  and  paper  is
     unthinkable.

             I'm overstating the case, of course.  The point is -- and
     several writers have pointed this out lyrically -- it's great fun
     to  horse around with code and see how (or if) you can get things
     to come out.  I've even been quoted myself as saying that one  of
     the  marks  of  a  virtuoso programmer is the ability to convince
     people that the program you ended up with  was  really  what  you
     intended  to  do  in  the  first place,  more or less.  To put it
     poetically,  it's a heck of a hacker who can hook  the  hawks  of
     hoke code for hicks.

             Fooling around can be a lot of fun,  whether you do it in
     school, at the beach, or while programming.  If your object is to
     have a good time, go ahead,  with my blessing.  If your object is
     to have a good program, well...

             It's  a  lot of fun to eat a good meal:  it's not so much
     fun to plan and prepare it beforehand,  or  to  wash  the  dishes
     afterward.  I  suspect  it's  the same thing with programs.  It's
     more fun to dive in and chop at the code:  it's much less fun  to
     plan  before  and  document  afterward.   When  I  look  at  some
     programs,  I sometimes wish that the programmer had  worn  a  bib
     when writing it.  I can see the litter of leftover and patched-up
     code in there.

             If  you  are writing a one-shot program for your own use,
     go to it.  If it slugs away for  two  minutes  and  then  reports
     ?SYNTAX  ERROR  IN LINE 5870,  chop in a repair and run it again.
     And if the  repair  doesn't  work,  try  another  chop.  If  THAT
     doesn't  work,  sit down and think.  Sound familiar?  That's what
     you get when you hack at a program, and it can be lots of fun.

             But be aware  that  free  flight  coding  does  have  its
     problems.  Such as:  (i) you drag the program out six weeks later
     and can't read it yourself;  (ii) you make a small change and the
     whole thing collapses for no apparent reason; (iii) you give away
     or  sell  copies,  and  people  phone you telling you things that
     don't work properly;  (iv) your program wins a  prize  in  "worst
     code of the year";  (v) somebody sends you a "cleaned up" rewrite
     of your program that uses one-third of the lines;  (vi) you wrote
     it  for  ten  provinces,  and  it  turns  out  that  it cannot be
     converted to fifty states without a total rewrite.

             It's okay to write green slime coding.  But keep in  mind
     the  following  thoughts.  If  you  want  to  publish or sell it,
     you'll also want to do massive  cleaning  up.  Also,  well-shaped
     coding  gives you a good feeling;  you feel proud of not just the
     program,  but also the coding it contains.  Moreover,  if you get
     into trouble, you can scrap the old program and start over.  When
     you rewrite it you may have nothing written down, but you'll have
     a  plan:  the  organization of the program as you perceived it on
     the previous write.

             If you write "natcheral" code and enjoy it,  and if  your
     programs  work,  good  for  you!  It's  hard  to  knock a working
     program.  But  there's  another  factor:  pride  of  workmanship.
     Sometimes  you  just  feel  good  about  a  program that you have
     written.  You may not know why, but you'd like to show the coding
     to others because the parts fit together  so  neatly.  When  this
     happens,  it's usually a question of style.  Often, you've solved
     a specific program in a general way.  For example, you might have
     calculated the average value of five numbers,  but you've done it
     in  such  a  way  that  a  minor  change  would  perform the same
     calculation for a hundred values.  You've gone from the  specific
     task  to  a general solution,  and that makes you a more powerful
     programmer.

             You might have heard a lot of  talk  about  "structured",
     "goto-less",  or  "top-down"  programming.  These are essentially
     concerned  with  planning,   rather  than  programming  as   such
     (although  it's  easy  to  be  misled  by  the mechanics).  Their
     general objective  is  to  encourage  you  (or  shove  you)  into
     creating  a  program  that  flows in an orderly way,  rather than
     hopping around.  A program should be  something  like  a  railway
     line,  with main line, spurs, and sidings clearly identified;  it
     shouldn't be like a city map with no clear path from one point to
     another.  I see programs in which the programmer  seems  to  have
     arrived in a maze of twisting little passages, all the same.

             You  might  think that you write only one line at a time,
     but it's not so.  If you write FOR J=1 TO 10 in a program, you're
     engaged in planning ahead.  You  plan  to  repeat  the  next  new
     statement ten times,  and you've committed yourself to eventually
     writing a NEXT  J.  There's  no  such  thing  as  truly  barefoot
     programming  --  your  mind is always thinking a few lines ahead,
     and you're always planning.  The real danger is to write IF  X>10
     GOTO  575  hoping  that when you get to 575 you will have figured
     out what to do when X is greater than 10.

             But whether or not you admit to planning,  whether or not
     you  do  more  of it or less of it,  do continue to have fun with
     your programming.  And if you can break the rules and still  come
     up with a neat program that works well, more power to you.

              Information needed on Fidonet compatible clones


     As  a  not  too  technically  sophisticated  user,  I  find  that
     documentation  is  a necessity to get anything done.  It was good
     to see Tom Jennings call for an  udpdate  on  Fidonet  protocols.
     One  other  area that,  if it has not already been updated,  that
     could stand some attention is compatibility between Fido and  the
     proliferation of clones, PC,XT, and AT, that have hit the market.
     Ditto  for all of the so-called Hayes compatible modem clones out
     there.  If you live in the boonies and do most of your purchasing
     mail order, you need to hit things right the first time or suffer
     a lot of inconvenience if not expense.  Therefore,  I would  like
     to update the documenation on compatible computers and modems.

     If  you  are running FIDO on a machine NOT listed in the original
     documentation and/or using a modem NOT described in the  original
     FIDO  documentation,  would you send the following information to
     me at 11/301?  I will then compile the list and send in  to  this
     journal.  Please set up your information as follows so I can read
     it  into  my  database.  A  carriage  return and line feed should
     appear between fields.  I think  this  will  help  a  lot  of  us
     looking  at  the  very  inexpensive  machines  now on the market.
     Specific machines being sought are the  generic  clones,  the  AT
     clones,  and  any exotics such as the Apricot that folks have had
     some luck with.

     Thom Henderson, 107/8
     System Enhancement Associates

                           Automated File Relays


     A common problem faced by  FidoNet  sysops  is  how  to  reliably
     automate  the  relaying of files,  particularly the node list and
     newsletter.  Our Robot program has assisted greatly in this task,
     but problems sometime arise when file mailings are delayed.

     In a typical case,  a sysop will expect to receive the node  list
     on,  say,  Sunday morning, and will pass it on by placing entries
     in the Robot control file like so:

         Sun input\nodelist.a* 107/4
         Sun input\nodelist.a* 107/5
         Sun input\nodelist.a* 107/6


     This works,  but has a drawback.  If the node list isn't received
     when  expected,  then  the  relay  messages  are  still  sent.  A
     somewhat better approach makes use of the EXIST keyword, like so:

         Sun exist input\nodelist.a* 107/4
         Sun exist input\nodelist.a* 107/5
         Sun exist input\nodelist.a* 107/6


     This is a bit better because the relay  messages  won't  be  sent
     unless  there  is  a node list to be relayed.  In most cases this
     will work properly.  But consider the case where the node list is
     delayed a day,  for  whatever  reason.  Robot  won't  create  the
     messages because the node list wasn't there on Sunday.

     A more reliable method involves two directories, and makes use of
     Robot's "demand mode".  Assuming two directories called INPUT and
     OUTPUT, an external event can be set to run immediately after the
     national mail hour, like so:

         :relay
         if not exist input\nodelist.a* goto nolist
         del output\nodelist.a*
         copy input\nodelist.a* output
         del input\nodelist.a*
         robot list

         :nolist
         if not exist input\fnews*.arc goto nonews
         del output\fnews*.arc
         copy input\fnews*.arc output
         del input\fnews*.arc
         robot news

         :nonews

     Fidonews                     Page 7                   21 Apr 1986


     The  Robot control file to go with this would look something like
     this:

         list: output\nodelist.a* 107/3
         list: output\nodelist.a* 107/4
         list: output\nodelist.a* 107/5
         news: output\fnews*.arc 107/3
         news: output\fnews*.arc 107/4
         news: output\fnews*.arc 107/5


     The advantage to this approach is that the  file  relay  messages
     are  triggered  by  the  receipt  of the file to be relayed.  The
     outgoing messages will be sent ONLY when a new file is  received,
     regardless  of  when  that  happens.  If a node list is delayed a
     day, or two, or four, it will still be properly sent.


     Special note: In DOS 2.0 and 2.1 and IF EXIST cannot take a path.
     If you do not have DOS 3.0 or 3.1,  then it will be necessary  to
     change directories to test for the presence or absence of a file.

     Joseph E Rock, Jr; 128/15

                         Z-Fido.  Z-Fido?  Z-Fido!

     From  what I have seen,  most of the Fido BBS's are hosted on IBM
     PCs or clones.  I was  not  much  of  a  BBS  person  until  very
     recently.  When  I  went  to  the  local  Heath Users Group (HUG)
     meeting the sysop of the local  Fido  Host  (Richard  Evers)  was
     there.  During the discussion,  he brought up the idea of getting
     Fido to run on a Z-100.  He said that the necessary software  (an
     interrupt  handler)  was not available for the Z-100.  I thought:
     "that can't be very difficult to write." And promptly volunteered
     to produce the driver on my Z at home. Well, the warning that Tom
     Jennings gives in the Generic.doc and Generic.asm files is true -
     writing the driver is not a piece of cake.  However, I did manage
     to  write  and debug the software within one week.  Now,  my Z is
     running as a FidoNode (128/15) except the times when  I  need  to
     use it for other things (like writing articles or trying to chase
     the bugs out of programs).

     Writing  the interrupt handler was a very interesting experience.
     The first attempt was written in C.  This is a "great"  idea  and
     almost  (as in not quite) worked.  The bugs that it had are those
     frustrating type.  You load the driver, run your test program and
     if  you  run  the test program once or twice it appears to be all
     right.  But run it three or four times and look out - I would get
     the  "WILD  INTERRUPT"  message  scrolling  all  over the screen.
     After spending three fourths of an entire weekend working on  the
     C  version of the handler I decided that it was time to learn how
     to use assembler (I  had  some  experience,  but  not  more  than
     changing 10 lines in an already working routine).  From the first
     attempt,  I had a good feel for what the driver had to do to  get
     the job done.  The second attempt was then underway.  I wrote the
     driver, assembled it,  corrected all the dumb mistakes,  and then
     debugged it. The debugging process used simple test programs that
     called  the handler for one function at a time and a borrowed DEC
     VT-100 terminal (it's real difficult to see what  characters  are
     sent by watching the modem lights).  Anyway, I got it working and
     had Richard Evers call in to  test  the  handler  when  Fido  was
     running. It worked!!!

     I  was  feeling  real good when Richard asks "What about the 0 or
     Outside command?" We tried it and no, it didn't work. So, back to
     the editor I went and within two hours I had the  problem  solved
     and  when  we  tested  it  and everything worked fine it "made my
     day." I did run into a  few  minor  problems  after  the  initial
     success, but they were all easily corrected (like using the right
     /J switch for Fido).

     So  now  all  you Z-100 owners need not despair - you too can run
     Fido.  The interrupt handler and documentation can  be  retrieved
     from  the Colorado Springs HUG board (128/11).  All you need then
     is  Fido_gen  and   all   the   necessary   support   files   and
     documentation. Good luck and long live Z-Fido!!!

                         The Continuing Modem Saga

     As I'm sure you all know we have a modem crisis in  Europe.  Here
     are my latest contributions to the saga.

     After hearing reports that the Dataflex modem was finally working
     with Fido, I decided I would try it out for myself.  I had a very
     early  version of this modem,  and had been testing it six months
     ago,  but no joy.  Then I heard that Helge  Vindenes  (4703)  had
     been  so  exited  by  the  Dataflex modem that he had jumped on a
     plane and flew over to London just to pick one up!

     I went to see Dataflex and they seemed very keen to help  out.  I
     spoke  at  length  to  Bob  Manekshaw,  the guy who wrote the ROM
     software for the modem,  and he demonstrated  the  modem  calling
     Jersey_Fido  (formerly  Hughs_Fido  4406).  The Dataflex supports
     300 and 1200/75 and as far as  I  can  tell  it  is  fully  Hayes
     compatible.  It's an internal (card) modem,  but there is a boxed
     version coming shortly.

     We called Jersey_Fido at 1200/75 and 300 baud but the 12/75  link
     was a bit shaky.  We got through a couple of times at 1200/75 but
     other  times we weren't so lucky.  As I said Dataflex seemed keen
     to help and in fact are going to run a Fido of their own  shortly
     (4412).

     After  spending  the whole day at Dataflex I went home and set up
     the Dataflex modem on the Compulink Board.  I had a few  problems
     but  it was my fault.  I had another Dataflex multi-function card
     in my machine which had two COM ports  attached.  When  I  fitted
     the modem card it clashed with the existing COM ports.  The modem
     can  be  set  up  as either a modem on startup,  or a COM port (a
     standard 25 way D type is provided).  After realizing my  mistake
     with  the  clashing  COM ports I set the modem to COM2,  and as a
     modem on startup and plugged it in.

     The modem needs a full length slot and took a little fiddling  to
     get it in straight.  The telephone lead (British Telecom modular)
     is  at the top of the mounting plate,  and there is a volume knob
     at the  bottom.  Between  these  two  is  the  25  way  "D"  type
     connector when the board is used as a COM port.

     Once  fitted  in  my  Compaq  I booted up and ran the QMODEM comm
     program to do some testing.  The modem is actually supplied  with
     PC-TALK  but I prefer QMODEM.  I had a preliminary version of the
     manual which had known mistakes.  None the less the manual proved
     very informative and gave good coverage to the "AT" command  set.
     The manual also contains the complete PC-TALK manual.

     So far so good!  Now came the big test, I had spoken earlier with
     Hugh Ashborn (Jersey_Fido) and he suggested I use his FIDOMDM.BBS
     Fidonews                     Page 10                  21 Apr 1986


     string.  I did this and sure enough it worked fine.

     The first few callers came in at 300 which worked OK,  and then I
     got a call from Bob Manekshaw to test the modem at 1200/75.  This
     worked also much to my  relief  and  I  happily  left  the  modem
     running all night.  I set the volume pot to full (very loud!) and
     let  it  get  on  with  it.  The first few calls were OK but then
     things went a little strange.  I could hear the  modem  auto-baud
     rate  selecting but the tones seemed to be shorter in length that
     before.  I sat watching and listening for the  next  few  minutes
     and  the  same  thing  happened  time  after  time.  Of  course I
     couldn't tell what baud rate the caller was using  as  he  didn't
     actually get in, but I suspect it was 1200/75.

     I  then  got  a  call  from  Martin  Read (LaserMail 4410) and we
     decided to test the modem at 1200/75.  We had various problems at
     1200/75 ranging  from  no  connection  to  problems  I  can  best
     describe  as  "strange".  The  modem  seemed  fairly  reliable at
     detecting an incoming call at  1200/75  but  it  did  not  always
     trigger  Fido  at  the  correct baud rate.  I could hear that the
     tones  were  1200/75  but  Fido  had  connected  at   300   baud.
     Occasionally  Fido  did connect at 1200 and things went smoothly.
     More often than not though callers at 1200/75 were  connected  at
     300 baud.

     This  is  an  improvement over my other modems that refused point
     blank to even work at 1200/75 with the Compaq.  From the  callers
     point  of  view  a  connection  even at 300 baud when he is using
     1200/75 is better than failing to connect.

     I'm sure that all the modem manufacturers are extremely upset  at
     IBM's  lack of support for split baud rates as it has caused them
     (and us) a lot  of  unnecessary  aggravation.  I  think  Dataflex
     should  be congratulated an making their modem operate as well as
     it does at 1200/75.  It is a full-fledged  computer  in  its  own
     right.  Unfortunately,  in  the fickle world of computing nothing
     but the best is good enough,  and even  then  it's  probably  too
     expensive.  I  see  the  Dataflex IDM modem as one of the best so
     far,  and I'm going to stick with it.  Sure it has a few problems
     but it performs pretty well even though.

     From  the  sysops  point of view the fact that it doesn't work at
     1200/75 properly is an aggravation.  You can  of  course  disable
     the  auto-baud rate selection (as I have done for the time being)
     and just let it work at 300.  I have had it on line for  about  a
     week  and  apart  from  the  problems I had when I was testing at
     1200/75 it has connected and worked very well for about  95%  off
     the time.

     From  the  non-sysop's point of view it works (almost) perfectly.
     Most people will be using it to originate calls,  which  it  does
     very  well.  I  think  I  have struck up a good relationship with
     Dataflex and with their cooperation (and ours through feedback) I
     think we all could be onto a winner.

                           THE WORLD OF COMPUTING
                        written by Reuven M. Lerner
                              FidoMail 107/33


         Hello,  and welcome to The World of Computing #4!  This  week
     will  be  devoted  to  a  new  copy-protection  scheme as well as
     reviews of two books that I read recently.

         About mail:  I love to get mail about what I'm writing, be it
     positive  or  negative.  Unless  I'm  absolutely  overwhelmed  by
     FidoMail,  which hasn't happened yet,  I promise to reply  within
     two days of my reading it.



         Copy Protection....sometimes

         What  is  one  of  the  most  interesting  new forms of copy-
     protection  has  been  introduced  by  MECA,  whose  best-selling
     program  "Managing  Your Money" has received good reviews by most
     magazines.  I read about "Russian Roulette Pirating" in  Personal
     Computing  magazine,  and  was  intrigued by the problems that it
     causes while solving old ones.

         To understand their form of protection,  let me review one of
     the  similar  types  of copy-protection,  the key-disk technique.
     The idea is that you can make as many copies as  you  want  of  a
     product,  but  you  must show the original disk when you start up
     the program.  Many software companies  have  started  using  this
     system recently, mostly on the IBM and Macintosh computers.

         The  idea  is  that  it  allows you to make copies,  and thus
     prevent trashing the original disk,  without actually letting you
     roam   free   handing   copies   out   to  your  friends  (which,
     unfortunately,  some people do when there  is  no  protection  at
     all).  It  does  its job well,  but there is still the problem of
     what happens when you spill coffee on the original disk and  have
     to wait two weeks for a new copy.

         The  new MECA system is similar to the key-disk,  except that
     it doesn't ask you for the key disk every time.  Every few  uses,
     from  1  to  300,  the  computer asks you to insert the key disk.
     That allows for copies to be functional,  and the originals to be
     safe most of the time.

         If  you  don't  have the key disk,  you can either run out to
     your friend who copied it for you,  or buy  a  new  copy  of  the
     program  for  $200  from  MECA,  no questions asked (they must be
     pretty confident that this is going to work if they won't  ask  a
     single question about why the person needs a new key disk).

         Of   course,   random   key-disk   protection  is  much  less
     objectionable that regular  key-disk  protection,  and  it  shows
     remarkable  caring  on  the  part  of  the  company  for what the
     consumer wants.  The only problem is that it still doesn't  allow
     Fidonews                     Page 12                  21 Apr 1986


     the  person  to  make  fully functional backups,  something which
     keeps me from wholeheartedly recommending the system.

         As I said before,  it means that the companies are trying  to
     make the consumers happy, and are willing to lose a few customers
     in order to do so.  MECA is a company to be emulated,  especially
     by the companies that put out those terrible  worm-code  programs
     that destroy disks physically.

         One  such  worm program was written up in a recent InfoWorld,
     and it's such an example that I'll share it with you here.

         A company executive recently bought a package for his company
     that used the Hard  Disk  Prolok  scheme,  one  which  physically
     damages  disks if copies are made,  but allows you to make copies
     onto hard disks.  Unfortunately,  the company had several copies,
     and  their  entire  hard disk was wiped out because of the Prolok
     protection.

         That is not only terrible to hear  about,  but  is  downright
     unethical  as  well.  How can a company such as Vault,  who makes
     the Prolok program, eithically distribute programs that they know
     might damage hard disks containing literally megabytes of crucial
     data?

         If I were handing out awards as  some  other  columnists  do,
     Vault would get the Crumpled Diskette Award.



         Whole Earth Software Catalog

         I  don't  remember  where  I first read about the Whole Earth
     Software Catalog.  I do remember, though, that it didn't get such
     great reviews.  Well, despite all that's been said,  I bought the
     catalog for 1986, interestingly called the 2.0 edition.

         First off,  I don't know why they call it a software catalog.
     It's primarily software, but they have hardware reviews, magazine
     and book reviews,  predictions for this year,  and a lot of other
     things  that,  in my mind,  don't exactly fit into the "software"
     category.

         Stuart Brand,  the Editor in Chief of the catalog,  obviously
     spent  time on this book,  but in my mind,  not enough.  The book
     reads more like a long magazine than  a  real  book,  with  short
     reviews,  lots of pictures,  and slick magazine-type pages.  Each
     review is preceeded by a cute,  but unnecessary  quip  about  the
     product.

         The  way  that  it  is  organized  is  one  of  the catalog's
     redeeming factors.  It has eleven main chapters,  each devoted to
     another  kind of activity (e.g.  writing,  playing,  programming,
     learning), which makes it easy to look up products that you need.
     There is an index for most major computers,  as well  as  a  full
     index  for those of us who like to browse through indexes and see
     Fidonews                     Page 13                  21 Apr 1986


     what's in the book.

         Can I recommend this book?  Not unless you get  it  for  much
     less  than  the  recommended $17.95.  I can't see its value being
     much more than $9 or so.  Better luck next time, in 1987.



         The Complete Handbook of Personal Computer Communications

         This is the best book  of  its  kind  that  I've  ever  seen,
     anywhere!  From plugging in your modem, to understanding bits and
     baud,  to error-checking protocols,  to a two-page description of
     Fido,  Alfred Glossbrenner deserves  to  charge  more  than  just
     $14.95 for this masterpiece of a book.

         In  a  huge book that details everything that you'd ever want
     to know about telecommunicating,  Mr.  Glossbrenner  has  done  a
     fine job in his research and in his writing.

         I  saw  the first edition of the book (the second edition has
     been out only about four months), and used it constantly whenever
     I didn't  know  what  was  happening.  The  second  one  corrects
     mistakes that were in the first edition, gives more hints (called
     "Online Tips"), and much more!

         It's  almost  impossible to describe this book,  but once you
     get it, I think that you'll agree that it's the ultimate resource
     material for people like you and me.



         Next time

         That's about it for this week.  Next time,  I'm going to talk
     about  educational  programs that I've tested,  and the future of
     computers in schools.  Until next week, happy computing!

                   File-Compression Program Lowers User's
                 Connect Costs While Increasing Disk Space

                                By Garry Ray


     One of the problems with PC disk files is they never stop coming.
     The more floppies you have, the more you need. The larger your
     hard disk, the smaller it seems to get. And it probably goes
     without saying that adding a modem to any PC system at least
     doubles the monthly telephone bill.

     ARC, a unique utility program from System Enhancement Associates,
     of Wayne, N.J., solves many of these problems. Originally
     released in early 1985, the program has quickly become a standard
     on the PC bulletin-board circuit, replacing other popular "public
     domain" programs such as Squeeze (SQ), Unsqueeze (USQ) and
     Library Utility 86 (LU86).

     The primary function of all these utilities is to compress and
     link disparate files into a single, smaller whole. The immediate
     and most significant benefit passes to those who regularly
     transfer files from one PC to another via telephone lines. With
     ARC, you can lop off excessive telephone-connection charges by
     converting, for example, 300K bytes of text files into a single
     file of less than 160K bytes.

     The result? A simple 1,200-bit-per-second file transfer between
     the East and West coasts would cost about $7 less than otherwise
     (based on AT&T day-rate charges). Do that just a few times and
     you've paid for the program. A few more and you're making money.

     Connect charges aren't the only things you'll save with ARC.
     Floppy- and hard-disk space can be vastly increased by storing
     like files in archives. It's fairly evident that converting that
     same 300K bytes of files into a 160K-byte archive file will pay
     off in two ways_better disk organization and more optimal use of
     the storage device.

     Using ARC is about as simple as anything could be. The program is
     invoked from the DOS command line by typing "ARC," with a series
     of command-line switches and file specifications determining the
     action the program will take.

     When invoked without any commands, ARC will merely display a
     copyright notice and a command summary, and then return the user
     to DOS. The command summary is the only "on-line help" the
     program displays, though it certainly is sufficient, given the
     simplicity of ARC.
     Fidonews                     Page 15                  21 Apr 1986


     The most important program commands are Add, Move and Extract.
     Like the rest of the ARC commands, these are invoked by typing
     the first letter of the command on the DOS command line,
     immediately after the command "ARC."

     A typical command sequence might be "ARC A TEXT *.TXT," which
     means "add to an archive file called `TEXT.ARC' all the files on
     the current subdirectory and drive with the file-name extension
     `.TXT'."  The Move command, specified on the command line with
     the letter "M," would simply delete all the desired files from
     the DOS directory after they had been added to the archive file.

     While it's creating and adding to archive files, ARC performs a
     number of additional tricks. Every file is individually examined
     to determine its type and structure, at which point ARC selects
     one of three built-in file-compression techniques. The
     compression algorithms are extremely complex, but suffice it to
     say that text files are usually reduced in size by 40 to 60
     percent, and binary files by anywhere from 15 to 35 percent.

     Files can be added to an archive with no compression at all
     (using the "suppress" command), and later packed and squeezed by
     invoking the "convert" command switch.

     Finally, the Extract command (invoked with either "x" or "e" on
     the command line) is the tool that allows users to remove files
     from the archive. Using the above example, the entire contents of
     an archived file can be extracted to original form by typing "ARC
     X TEXT," in which case all files are "uncompressed" and placed in
     the current subdirectory as individual files.

     Users can also use standard DOS file-specification commands to
     select individual or groups of files for extraction. For
     instance, all 1-2-3 worksheet files could be extracted by the
     command "ARC X LOTUS *.WKS".

     In any case, the original archive file retains all its original
     contents, though unneeded files can be subsequently deleted with
     the ARC "delete" command.

     If you've forgotten which archive file contains what, two ARC
     commands allow you to get either short or long archive
     directories. The short listing displays the file name, length,
     original file creation date, and the uncompressed length of each
     file.

                             Inherent Verbosity

     The long listing (available through the "verbose" command), shows
     more detailed information, such as each file's compressed size,
     the compression technique used, the creation date and time, and
     the Cyclical Redundancy Check (CRC) value for each file. The CRC
     value is used by ARC to determine the integrity of the file
     during compression and extraction, though a user command, "test,"
     also uses the CRC value for the same purpose.

     Fidonews                     Page 16                  21 Apr 1986


     In addition to all the primary archiving and compression
     commands, ARC allows the archived file contents to be either
     viewed, printed or even executed with the "run" and "print"
     commands. Run does exactly that -- it runs the .COM, .EXE, .BAT
     or .BAS file specified on the ARC command line.

     This did not seem to us a highly useful command, since the
     processing overhead required by ARC just didn't seem to be worth
     the trouble. Instead, it seems easier just to "unarchive" the
     appropriate file and run it in the normal manner. Additionally,
     the "run" command does not accept command-line parameters for the
     program being invoked.

     Last but not least is ARC's "garble" command, which allows the
     user to encrypt files as they are added to the archive. A user-
     supplied password of any length can be used for encryption and
     must be subsequently supplied for any other ARC operation
     regarding the file(s).

                             Excellent Support

     System Enhancement Associates' technical support for ARC is
     outstanding. The program is regularly updated to incorporate new
     features, or to repair bugs that may have entered into previous
     versions. A $50 maintainance fee provides five annual update
     disks.

     Program documentation, license policies and revision histories
     are included in a DOS text file distributed with the program in
     ARC format. Those who purchase ARC directly from the developer
     also receive a number of "free" utility programs and the source
     code (in both C and 8086 assembler) for all programs.

     In sum, ARC is a fairly sophisticated and eminently useful
     product for which savvy users will find a number of applications.
     The fact that it is distributed as a "shareware" program and that
     reasonable site licenses are available makes this a good
     candidate for at least a trial run.

     Arkansas, and Louisiana.  This person will be responsible for all
     of the duties of a Region Coordinator as described in the current
     POLICY1.DOC.  This sysop must have adequate  time  to  devote  to
     supporting Region 19.

     This  Fido  will  be  the  first  to  receive  the  NODEDIFF.Ann,
     FidoNews, etc. and will be expected to make them available to the
     other Networks in Region 19.  This Fido will be  responsible  for
     taking applications for and encouraging the formation of new Nets
     in  Region 19.  This Fido will be expected to resolve disputes in
     Region 19 so she/he must be a good problem solver.

     We would prefer someone with a 2400 baud modem, and that has been
     up and running for no less than  three  months.  We  will  accept
     applicants  from  any  node within the Region 19 area.  Please do
     NOT apply if you are already a Net coordinator.

     Please submit your qualifications,  including a paragraph on  why
     you  think  you would do a good job as the Region 19 Coordinator,
     to Ken Kaplan at Fido 1/0.

              Now available from Micro Consulting Associates!!

     Public Domain collection - 300+  "ARC"  archives  -  10  megs  of
     software  and  other  goodies,  and that's "archived" size!  When
     unpacked,  you get approximately 17 megabytes worth of all  kinds
     of  software,  from text editors to games to unprotection schemes
     to communications programs, compilers, interpreters, etc...

     This collection is the result of more than 10 months of intensive
     downloads from just about 100 or more BBS's  and  other  sources,
     all  of  which have been examined,  indexed and archived for your
     convenience.  Starting a Bulletin Board System?  Want to  add  on
     to your software base without spending thousands of dollars? This
     is the answer!!!

     To  order  the  library,  send  $100  (personal or company check,
     postal money order or company purchase order) to:

                    Micro Consulting Associates, Fido 103/511
                    Post Office Box 4296
                    200-1/2 E. Balboa Boulevard
                    Balboa, Ca. 92661-4296

     Please allow 3 weeks for delivery of your order.

     Note:  No profit is made from  the  sale  of  the  Public  Domain
     software  in  this  collection.  The price is applied entirely to
     the cost of  downloading  the  software  over  the  phone  lines,
     running  a  BBS  to  receive  file  submissions,  and inspecting,
     cataloguing, archiving and maintaining the files.  Obtaining this
     software  yourself  through  the  use  of a computer with a modem
     using commercial phone access would cost you much more than  what
     we charge for the service...

     Please specify what type of format you would like the disks to be
     prepared on.  The following choices are available:

             IBM PC-DOS Backup utility
             Zenith MS-DOS 2.11 Backup Utility
             DSBackup
             Fastback
             Plain  ol' files (add $50,  though,  it's a lot  of
             work and takes more diskettes...)

     Add  $30  if  you  want  the  library  on  1.2 meg AT disks (more
     expensive disks).  There are no  shipping  or  handling  charges.
     California residents add 6% tax.

     For each sale, $10 will go to the FidoNet Administrators.

                       SEAdog Electronic Mail System
                      Special Offer for FidoNet Sysops


     System Enhancement Associates, the makers of the popular ARC file
     archive utility,  are proud to announce the release of the SEAdog
     electronic mail system.

     SEAdog  is  a  PC-based  electronic  mail  system  which is fully
     FidoNet compatible.  In addition  to  all  the  functionality  of
     FidoNet mail, SEAdog adds the following:

     o   User directory support, for automatic lookup of node numbers

     o   Return receipts

     o   Audit trails

     o   Message forwarding, with or without a retained copy

     o   Twenty four hour mail reception

     o   High priority mail for immediate delivery

     o   The ability to request files and updates of files from  other
         SEAdog systems.

     o   No route files needed!

     o   A full screen user interface that our beta test sites fell in
         love with!

     SEAdog  is  NOT a bulletin board system,  but it can be used as a
     "front end" for Fido (version 11q or later),  allowing you to add
     the full functionality of SEAdog to your existing system.

     SEAdog normally sells for $100/node, but for a limited time only
     we are offering SEAdog to registered FidoNet sysops for only $50!
     Orders may be placed by sending a check or money order to:

                       System Enhancement Associates
                       21 New Street, Wayne NJ 07470

     Or by calling (201) 473-5153 (VISA and MasterCard accepted).

     This coming Sunday,  the 27th of April,  most of the country goes
     on  Daylight  Savings  Time.  FidoNet  does  NOT observe Daylight
     Savings Time, so do NOT advance your system clock.

     If you want to advance your system clock anyway,  then  you  must
     also advance all of your mail events.
