      SOFTWARE CAREERS ECHO CONFERENCE UPDATE
       (Revised 1-19-87)

     A new Echo Conference devoted to discussion of various subjects
     effecting Software Engineers and MIS professionals has been
     started by SuperResume Fido in San Francisco, 125/612,
     415-546-0119.  SuperResume is operated by Lee Johnson, the
     owner of LEE JOHNSON INTERNATIONAL, a recruiting firm
     specializing in Software Engineering and MIS Professionals
     since 1974.  This 12 years of experience seeing candidates
     succeed and fail in their professional careers has provided
     some very interesting incites.  What is needed is a national
     forum to discuss these issues and bring together new ideas from
     a wide variety of professionals.  THE PROPOSED ECHO CONFERENCE
     DISCUSSION "AREAS HAVE BEEN REDUCED FROM 15 DOWN TO 3
     are as follows:

     JOBSENG ....... Software Engineering Jobs Echo (jobs with
                     VENDORS of computer systems)

     JOBSMIS ....... MIS Jobs Echo (jobs with USERS of computer
                     systems.)

     CARDIS ....... Software Careers Discussions Echo.
                    (Interview Techniques, Compensation Negotiation,
                     Contracting Pros/Cons, Career Plannning, etc.)

     SuperResume Fido 125/612 will initially function as the "hub"
     for the conference, and will poll participating Fidos.

     The file CARECHO.ARC is available for download on the
     SuperResume (tm) Fido (125/625 - 415-546-0119) for those who
     would like to participate in all or some of the above AREAS.
     It contains a copy of this announcement.

     In addition to coordinating the SOFTWARE CAREERS ECHO
     CONFERENCE, Lee Johnson is also making available his
     copyrighted SuperResume (tm) QUESTION.BBS file for Fido
     Sysops who wish to run it as the questionnaire feature of their
     Boards.  It produces a detailed, accomplishment-oriented
     resume.  This is extremely important because a resume is the
     single most important representation of a professional's
     career.  Many well qualified candidates never even get to first
     base (the interview) because they were screened-out due to an
     inadequate resume.  Nevertheless, most of people only think
     about their resume when they are considering changing jobs.  As
     a result, many deficient, flawed, and poorly constructed
     resumes are in circulation today, and many people's growth is
     being held back.

     Lee Johnson is also offering Fido Sysops A WAY TO DEFRAY A
     PORTION OF THE EXPENSE OF OPERATING THEIR BOARDS.   If a Board
     Fidonews                     Page 3                    2 Feb 1987


     runs the SuperResume Questionnaire and obtains a completed
     SuperResume (or any resume) of a Software Engineering or MIS
     Professional candidate, Lee Johnson will pay a $500.00 US
     finder's fee to the Sysop and $50.00 US to the National FidoNet
     Administrator if LJI successfully places that candidate.  If
     the Sysop personally interviews the candidate, and provides a
     written appraisal of the candidate, the finder's fee goes up to
     ten percent (10%) of LJI's gross fee, which sometimes can be
     $15,000, or a $1,500 finder's fee.   Detailed interviewing
     forms will be supplied if requested.

     If you are interested in either participating in the SOFTWARE
     CAREERS ECHO CONFERENCE, or in running the SuperResume (tm)
     Questionnaire (or both!), please contact Lee Johnson at:
     FidoMail 125/612; voiceline: 415-788-6000;
     dataline: 414-546-0119.

                       ATTENTION ECHOMAIL CONFERENCE
                               COORDINATORS

     EchoMail has  grown to become  one of the  most diverse,  useful,
     and interesting  utilities available to  Fido  SysOps today.  You
     all know  what it does..  Its ability to allow  multiple BBSes to
     share a  common discussion  board  allows  SysOps  unlimited  new
     ideas and prospects.

     EchoMail has  grown beyond all expectations.  Since its creation,
     local and nation  conferences have  come to  life all  around the
     world in virtually every net of the Fido Network.

     With this unexpected surge of growth,  however,  comes mass chaos
     and  confusion as  to the EchoMail  conferences that exist.  With
     that,  I get to the reason for which I have written this article.

     I would  like to propose  "The Official EchoMail Conference List"
     in which would be listed all existing EchoMail conferences,  both
     on a local,  and national  scale.  I will process this list,  and
     send copies to major nodes,  to be downloaded  accordingly.  This
     list  will not be  updated  on a regular basis,  rather  whenever
     enough  additions  or  deletions  are  present to  require  a new
     version.

     In order  to make this  list a reality,  I  need the  help of all
     EchoMail  conference  coordinators.  Please  send  a  message  to
     Genesis OPUS BBS,  in the  nodelist  under 135/3,  containing the
     following information:

          - Conference Name
          - Coordinator's Name
          - All participating Nodes
              (Name and Node #)
          - A brief description of the topic available
              on the conference.

     If you do not send this message,  your conference will not appear
     in the list.  It is up to you to get this message in on time.

     I cannot predict an accurate date of release,  however,  look for
     it about 1 month after this article appears in FidoNews.

     Thank you for your support.

       PROPOSAL FOR THE CREATION OF THE PUBLIC DIGITAL RADIO SERVICE

     FILED BY
     Donald L. Stoner, W6TNS
     October 20 1985

     SUMMARY OF PETITION

     This petition is to identify the need for a new  class  of  radio
     service.  This  radio service is described in the petition as the
     PUBLIC DIGITAL RADIO SERVICE.

     The  petition  shows  that  creation  of  the  service  and   the
     allocation of spectrum is in the public interest, convenience and
     necessity.

     Presently,  computer-to-computer  communication  by  the  general
     public is confined to the telephone network. Millions of computer
     owners find that it is increasingly  expensive  to  utilize  this
     network to satisfy their communication needs.

     Establishment  of  the  PUBLIC DIGITAL RADIO SERVICE would permit
     the owners of personal computers to communicate by radio. Instead
     of a traditional channelized scheme,  the  petition  describes  a
     radio Local Area Network (LAN).  The PUBLIC DIGITAL RADIO SERVICE
     permits an infinite number of local area  radio  networks  to  be
     interconnected into a national packet radio network.

     The  PUBLIC  DIGITAL RADIO SERVICE would allow computer owners to
     exchange  messages,   bulletins,   computer  programs  and  other
     information by radio, and at no cost.

     The petition describes how the Commission could create the PUBLIC
     DIGITAL  RADIO SERVICE,  which will adequately serve the needs of
     the public for at least the remainder of this century.

     BACKGROUND OF PETITIONER

     I have been a radio amateur (W6TNS) since 1954.  A large part  of
     my  career  has  been  devoted  to  the field of writing.  For an
     extended period,  I was the Novice and Technician  editor  of  CQ
     Magazine.  I  have  written  hundreds  of  articles  and authored
     several books on  the  subject  of  amateur  radio  and  computer
     communications. I was also responsible for the idea which grew to
     become  the  OSCAR  satellite,  and  I  was  able  to make useful
     contributions to the program during its early stages. I have been
     an educator and taught at Chaffey College in Southern California.

     This experience provided an  opportunity  to  observe  and  study
     personal motivation, goals, effort versus reward, and so on.

     During  the  70's I was involved in the manufacturing of Citizens
     Band communications equipment. Thus, I was able to write about CB
     initially and then participate in  its  "self  destruction".  The
     experience afforded the opportunity to see what "went wrong" and,
     with  hindsight,  to  realize  how to avoid these mistakes in the
     Fidonews                     Page 6                    2 Feb 1987


     future.

     In 1983, I made a reply comment to PR Docket No. 83-28.  This was
     the  controversial  "No-Code"  document.  As part of my reply,  I
     proposed "THE CREATION OF A COMPUTER HOBBYIST LICENSE CLASS".

     It was (and is) my contention that this license class would  have
     brought in literally millions people into amateur radio. However,
     the  amateur  fraternity  decided  that no amateur radio licenses
     should be granted,  under any circumstances without a Morse  code
     examination.

     Clearly,  the  proposal  for  a  "computer  radio  band" received
     considerable attention on the part  of  the  Commission.  In  its
     decision  relative to Docket 83-28,  the Commission left open the
     possibility of a radio service for computer  hobbyists.  However,
     radio spectrum was not allocated for such a service.

     It  is  the  purpose of this document to further amplify the need
     for  such  a  service,  to  make  a  recommendation  on  spectrum
     allocation,  and  to  outline technical specifications which will
     ensure the  successful  introduction  and  usage  of  the  PUBLIC
     DIGITAL RADIO SERVICE.

     The  accumulated  knowledge  of  the  writer has provided certain
     insights,  many of which have contributed to the  preparation  of
     this document. A careful and serious consideration of my petition
     by the Commission is sincerely appreciated.

     THE PETITION

     Why Is A Computer Radio Band Needed? The increasing popularity of
     personal  computing is well known.  There are presently more than
     18 million of these devices in the hands of the public.  Today, a
     computer can be purchased for less than $100.  Thus any American,
     rich or poor, can afford to own a personal computer. Many experts
     feel there will be a ten-fold  increase  in  the  acquisition  of
     computers by the end of this decade.

     The  Commission  is  aware  of the popularity of computers.  High
     frequency  digital  circuits   produce   radio   and   television
     interference.   The  Commission  recognized  the  growth  in  the
     personal computer market and regulated interference levels before
     an untenable situation occurred.

     The Commission is  also  aware  of  the  popularity  of  computer
     communications  via  the  telephone  network.  As a result of the
     "Carterphone Decision",  there has been an enormous  increase  in
     type   acceptance   applications  for  telephone  modem  devices.
     According  to  Creative  Strategies  International,  a  Cupertino
     Calif.,  research firm,  the modem market will reach $555 million
     by the end of 1985 and is expected to top $1.5 billion  by  1988.
     The  bulk  of  these  telephone  modem sales are to the owners of
     personal computers.  It is presently possible to purchase an  FCC
     approved modem for as little as $29.95. If one assumes an average
     price  of $100.00,  there will be 15 million modems in use by the
     Fidonews                     Page 7                    2 Feb 1987


     end of this decade.

     Why do owners of personal computers utilize modems? The desire to
     communicate with others having like interests does  not  diminish
     with the acquisition of a computer.  Computer owners like to play
     interactive games, exchange messages and software,  assist others
     having like computers, and so on.  This desire to communicate has
     provided the basis for a number of national information utilities
     such as The Source, CompuServe, PlayNet,  Delphi and The Shuttle.
     These  organizations  allow  computer  owners to interconnect and
     exchange all manner of information  via  the  national  telephone
     network.  These services are extremely popular.  CompuServe,  for
     example, claims to have 250,000 members.

     The exchange of information between computer owners is not  free,
     however.  These  information utilities charge hourly fees varying
     between $3.00 and $20.00,  depending on time of  access  and  the
     data rate.

     More  relevant  to  this discussion is the cost for the transport
     medium, the telephone network.  In the previous decade,  the cost
     of  a  computer  was  relatively  high while telephone costs were
     relatively low.  In  this  decade  the  situation  has  reversed.
     Telephone  companies  are beginning to implement charges based on
     time and distance for local calls.  Thus the cost to  the  public
     for computer communications will increase significantly.

     Recently,  a  number of telephone companies attempted to impose a
     surcharge on those using modems.  Some modem users have added  an
     expensive second telephone line. Without this alternate path, the
     telephone is essentially out-of-service while the user is on-line
     with  the computer.  Thus the user is unable to receive emergency
     calls.  At the slow data rates prevalent on  telephone  networks,
     these periods can be quite lengthy.

     It  should  be  stressed  that  much  of  the existing and future
     computer  communications  could  be  handled  by  suitable  radio
     devices.  Recently  there  has been a significant increase in the
     interest and use of radio waves to transport computer  data.  The
     trade   press   regularly   mentions   companies  trying  various
     approaches which avoid  the  use  of  telephone  lines  for  data
     communications.  The  most common activity seems to be the use of
     FM subcarriers for point-to-multipoint networks.

     Motorola has been a leader in the  area  of  point-to-point  data
     communications.  They  offer  a wireless data system which allows
     portable-computer  owners  (possessing  Motorola   cellular-radio
     telephones) to transmit data at speeds up to 1200 baud.

     Motorola  has  also  supplied  a hand-held terminal for IBM field
     engineers.   It  allows  two-way  communication  with  a  central
     transmitter and computer.

     Finally, Motorola has recently petitioned the Commission to share
     satellite frequencies in the 1.7 gHz.  range to create local area
     business radio networks.
     Fidonews                     Page 8                    2 Feb 1987


     All of the above products benefit the  business  community.  They
     are  designed  to  make  businesses  more profitable,  productive
     and/or efficient by transmitting computer data via radio.

     None of the products described above are intended to benefit  the
     general  public.  The  PUBLIC  DIGITAL  RADIO  SERVICE  can  make
     personal computers more useful,  interesting and/or productive to
     the general public. It is in the public interest, convenience and
     necessity  that  the  public  also  have  access to this precious
     resource called the radio spectrum.

     While modem  communications  will  continue  to  be  popular,  an
     alternate cost-free communication path should be available to the
     computer public.

     This document describes such a service, called the PUBLIC DIGITAL
     RADIO  SERVICE.  It  petitions  the  Commission  to create such a
     service with suitable  regulations  and  to  allocate  sufficient
     spectrum to insure the success of the service.

     TYPE OF SERVICE PROPOSED

     In  the  past,  there  has  been  some  discussion  of permitting
     computer communications  on  the  Citizens  Band.  CB  usage  and
     channel loading is currently a fraction of what it was during the
     previous  decade.  Four additional CB frequencies,  formerly used
     for the remote control of objects,  are virtually  unused.  Other
     bands  (in particular,  49 and 72 mHz) could accommodate computer
     communications.

     In  the above examples,  a channel scheme is implied.  The use of
     communication channels,  however,  leads to ham  type  operations
     ("send  the data to me on channel X").  Channelized operation and
     shared services would probably not work for  the  PUBLIC  DIGITAL
     RADIO  SERVICE.  The  users of this service will expect operation
     and performance similar to that of a telephone  modem.  Telephone
     modems do not have channels.

     The  computer  public  is  not interested in the radio aspects of
     communication other than as a means to an end.  Thus there is  no
     need  or desire for voice communications as part of an equivalent
     radio modem.  This precludes the "chit-chat"  type  of  operation
     which was destructive on the Citizens Band.

     Sharing  frequencies  with  voice  communication  (such as on CB)
     would be unacceptable. Interference, caused by frequency sharing,
     would  garble  the  received  data.  Since  the  interference  is
     transparent,  the  typical  user will assume that data errors are
     caused by equipment  faults.  Thus,  it  is  essential  that  the
     frequency  allocation for the PUBLIC DIGITAL RADIO SERVICE not be
     shared with any other service.

     Channelized plans inevitably lead to a further  problem.  If  the
     service becomes popular, there will ultimately be a need for more
     channels.  This  is  exactly  the situation which occurred on the
     Citizens Band. The Commission is well aware of the problems which
     Fidonews                     Page 9                    2 Feb 1987


     resulted from the disruption of adding additional CB channels.

     The alternative to a channelized scheme is to send  the  data  at
     high rates using packet technology. A single wideband channel can
     be  thought  of  as  a  digital  highway  with  addressed packets
     entering and leaving the route in a highly organized manner  (see
     "What Is A Packet Radio Network?").

     AN ALLOCATION OF SPECTRUM FOR THE PUBLIC DIGITAL RADIO SERVICE

     A  wideband  digital  channel can only be accommodated within the
     VHF band or higher frequencies.  To keep the  cost  of  equipment
     low,  a  band  between 30 and 300 mHz is ideal.  Some readers may
     feel that a service as described should be placed in the  UHF  or
     SHF range. This might be true if a suitable allocation within the
     30-300 mHz band did not exist.

     However,  within  this frequency range there is a band,  2 mHz in
     width,  which is virtually unoccupied  and  therefore  unused.  I
     refer  to the spectrum between 52 and 54 mHz.  Radio amateurs are
     permitted to operate on frequencies between 50 and  54  mHz  (the
     six  meter  band).   For  a  number  of  reasons,  this  band  is
     "underoccupied".

     It is estimated that out of 400,000 radio amateurs in the  United
     States, less than 1,000 are active on the six meter band.

     Due  to  the  potential  for inteference with adjacent television
     channel 2 (54-60 mHz),  virtually all  six  meter  users  operate
     between  50  and  52  mHz.  For  all practical purposes the radio
     spectrum between 52 and 54 mHz is wasted.

     The radio spectrum is a precious natural resource much  the  same
     as our beaches and national parks. The public access to the radio
     spectrum  resource  is  severely  limited.  The  entry  fee is an
     amateur radio license.  This can be justified in instances  where
     the  resource  is  severely limited or where national security is
     involved.   It  cannot  be  justified  by  any  stretch  of   the
     imagination when the beach or park is totally deserted!

     POTENTIAL FOR TV INTERFERENCE

     The Cause of Interference- Radio amateurs have not used the 52.0-
     54.0  mHz  portion  of the six meter band due to the high risk of
     television interference. This interference problem occurs through
     no fault of the amateur or the transmitting equipment.

     A typical ham six meter transmitter can induce several  volts  of
     radio  frequency  energy  in  a  nearby  television antenna.  The
     induced voltage can be  thousands  of  times  stronger  than  the
     television station being received.  Thus,  the strong signal from
     the ham station can overload the TV receiver.

     This effect is called crossmodulation and can cause  interference
     on all channels.  The level of interference can vary in intensity
     from "crosshatching" to a total loss of the picture.
     Fidonews                     Page 10                   2 Feb 1987


     Radio  amateurs  have  access  to  many  bands   of   frequencies
     throughout the radio spectrum.  None of the other bands share the
     close proximity to television channels  as  does  the  six  meter
     band.  Clearly,  amateurs have resolved the problem of television
     interference simply by not using this portion of  the  six  meter
     band.

     To  date,  no  one  has  addressed  the  problem  of  using these
     frequencies  in  a  manner  which  will  not   cause   television
     interference.

     This  portion  of  the spectrum could be utilized by reducing the
     power output of the transmitter below the point where  television
     interference can occur.

     Eliminating Interference- It is the opinion and experience of the
     writer  that  no  televison  interference  can occur from a radio
     modem operating in the 52.0-  54.0  mHz  band  if  the  following
     conditions are met:

     1.zThe  signal  strength of the TV station being received exceeds
        100 uvolts.

     2.zThe effective radiated power of an adjacent radio  modem  does
        not exceed one watt.

     3.zThe  separation  between  the  radio  modem  antenna  and  the
        television antenna exceeds 8 meters.

     4.zThe radio modem antenna is vertically polarized  with  respect
        to the horizontally polarized TV receiving antenna.

     5.zAll  modulation  and  spurious products which fall outside the
        authorized bandwidth conform to the FCC 43 plus 10 log10 rule.

     If these conditions are met,  the 52.0- 54.0  mHz  band  will  be
     suitable  for the PUBLIC DIGITAL RADIO SERVICE and no significant
     television interference will occur.

     WHAT IS A PACKET RADIO NETWORK?

     The reader may be familiar with the  term  "local  area  network"
     (LAN). In this system a limited number of computers are connected
     together by cable in a manner which permits intercommunication. A
     packet  radio  network  is  an infinite number of LAN's connected
     together by radio waves.

     A packet radio network may be thought of as a digital  equivalent
     of the U.S. Postal Service. The information to be sent to another
     computer  is  equivalent to a letter.  The letter is placed in an
     envelope which includes a destination address. This is called the
     packet.  This packet is sent along with those of other users into
     the network, which acts like a mailbag.

     The  packet  address  also  includes  something like a postal zip
     code.  The postal analogy varies  somewhat  in  the  handling  of
     Fidonews                     Page 11                   2 Feb 1987


     messages.  Each  radio  modem  connected  to  the  network  is  a
     destination mailbox.  At the same time it can also act as a "post
     office" for others connected to the network.

     Each  user  is  considered  to  be a "node" in the PUBLIC DIGITAL
     RADIO SERVICE.  These stations or nodes  constantly  monitor  the
     transmissions  (mailbags),  looking for packets (envelopes) which
     are addressed to them.  If a message addressed  to  the  node  is
     detected, it is held in memory (the recipients mailbox).

     The message may be intended for a nearby node as indicated by the
     "zip code".  In this case,  the node "mailbox" does not activate.
     Rather,  the node becomes a "post office" and passes the  message
     to  one  or  more  other  nodes.  The  reply from the destination
     computer is handled in the  same  manner  but  the  direction  is
     reversed.

     Packet  radio transmission (movement of the "mailbags") can occur
     at very high speed.  In fact,  the speed is only limited  by  the
     bandwidth of frequencies allocated to the network.  This petition
     requests a band of frequencies 2 mHz in width. This is sufficient
     to handle data rates in excess of 1 million bits per second. When
     one considers that the typical rate of  data  transmission  on  a
     telephone network is 300 bits per second, it can be seen that the
     PUBLIC  DIGITAL  RADIO  SERVICE  can  handle  a  large  number of
     simultaneous users.

     Unlimited Users- Actually,  the number of simultaneous  users  is
     unlimited due to an advantage of FM radio transmission called the
     "capture  effect".  Each  node  will "hear" (or capture) only the
     strongest stations in  the  immediate  area  of  the  node.  More
     distant   stations   will   be   inaudible  and  will  not  cause
     interference. Thus users in two adjacent cities (for example) can
     communicate within the cities without interference from users  in
     the adjacent city.  Of course, if it is desired to send a message
     to a user in the adjacent city, the appropriate nodes will repeat
     the message until it  reaches  the  destination  and  triggers  a
     delivery  acknowledgment.  Other  messages,  not addressed to the
     adjacent city, will be ignored.

     WHAT IS A RADIO MODEM?

     The device to control the node (see previous  section)  functions
     similar  to  a ham radio "digipeater" but at a much higher speed.
     Since the the  term  "digipeater"  has  no  significance  to  the
     general  public,  the  node controller is referred to as a "radio
     modem".

     What is it?- Technically speaking,  the radio  modem  is  a  non-
     persistent,   carrier  sense,   multiple  access  with  collision
     avoidance device.  In practice,  the radio modem  consists  of  a
     small  box,  whip antenna and coaxial cable.  The unit contains a
     receiver and transmitter,  in  addition  to  an  RS-232  computer
     interface.

     In  addition to acting as a transceiving device,  the radio modem
     Fidonews                     Page 12                   2 Feb 1987


     is also capable of repeating received packets on the basis  of  a
     stored  algorithm.  In  other words,  it will receive,  store and
     retransmit messages along the addressees route.  Note that it  is
     capable  of acting as a repeater even if it is not connected to a
     computing device.

     Training- Upon activation,  the radio  modem  executes  a  stored
     training sequence.  When first installed, the radio announces its
     presence and digital address in  the  network.  The  radio  modem
     transmits  its  position with respect to other units,  determines
     the digital address of other nearby units  and  finally,  adjusts
     its   power   output   to   the   minimum  required  to  maintain
     communications with the other nearby units.  This power can  vary
     from  1  milliwatt  for  densely  populated  areas  to the 1 watt
     maximum in rural areas.  It is essential  that  the  radio  modem
     transmit  only  sufficient  energy to maintain contact with other
     nearby radio modems (nodes).

     Training the radio modem for power output insures that a  minimum
     signal  level  is  radiated  by  the  antenna.  The purpose is to
     minimize the possibility of television interference. Some readers
     may point out that one watt is simply not enough power for  rural
     areas. However, it is not the purpose of the PUBLIC DIGITAL RADIO
     NETWORK to duplicate the elaborate trunks of the public telephone
     network.  There are bound to be areas which cannot pass messages.
     Under no circumstances should consideration be given to increased
     power output  in  these  instances.  If  a  high  power  mode  is
     available, it will be abused.

     A COMPARISON WITH CB RADIO

     Those  reviewing  this  petition  may  have  a  tendency  to make
     comparisons with the introduction,  usage and the degeneration of
     the 27 mHz Citizens Radio band.

     The  following points are presented with this comparison in mind.
     No one,  including the petitioner,  would like to see the  PUBLIC
     DIGITAL  RADIO  SERVICE meet the same fate as the 27 mHz Citizens
     Band.

     There is a major reason for the chaos which developed on  the  27
     mHz Citizens Band.  The licensees of this service did not feel it
     was in their interests to abide by the Rules and Regulations.  We
     can  learn from this experience by designing a service where Rule
     compliance is in the interests of the user.

     MODULATION- There must be no provision for  voice  communications
     in  the PUBLIC DIGITAL RADIO SERVICE.  Users of radio modems wish
     to exchange digital data, not the spoken word.

     IDENTIFICATION- Enactment of a PUBLIC DIGITAL RADIO SERVICE  will
     not  affect  the  licensing workload of the Commission.  Services
     which are essentially self-regulating (such as the remote control
     of objects, garage door openers,  etc.) do not require the use of
     call letters.  Inherent in the addressability of the radio modem,
     is a built-in aid to compliance and enforcement. Each radio modem
     Fidonews                     Page 13                   2 Feb 1987


     has its own unique  identification  code,  that  is,  its  packet
     address.  This  is  both the serial number and digital address of
     the unit.  This code also identifies  the  manufacturer  and  the
     physical  location  of  the radio modem.  Violations of technical
     requirements can be easily  be  correlated  by  manufacturer.  In
     other words,  if a significant number of units are observed to be
     defective,  the manufacturer can  be  immediately  determined  by
     serial number correlation.

     If  a  unit  is  found  to  be  non-complying,  a  message can be
     addressed to that radio modem advising the user of  the  problem.
     The   Commission  personnel  sending  the  message  receives  the
     customary delivery acknowledgment of the message.  Thus there can
     be no question that the user received the Notice of Violation.

     POWER OUTPUT- A major contributing factor to the "CB problem" was
     the  addition  of  power  amplifiers to CB radios in an effort to
     increase the talk range.

     Adding  a  power  amplifier  to  a  radio  modem  will produce no
     increase in performance.  The unit will "retrain" to  reduce  its
     power output to maintain the nominal signal level at nearby radio
     modems.  Thus,  the  power  delivered  to the antenna might be 50
     milliwatts (as an example), with or without the power amplifier.

     ANTENNA- To  further  increase  transmitting  range,  high  gain,
     directional  antennas  were  connected to CB radios.  If the same
     type of antenna were connected to a radio modem,  it would result
     in a "negative improvement". There would be no increase in range,
     since the radio modem would retrain to produce the nominal signal
     strength  at  nearby  nodes.  More  important,  the  radio  modem
     connected to a directive antenna  could  miss  messages  arriving
     from  directions  other than the antenna principal gain lobe.  By
     the same token,  raising the elevation of the antenna would cause
     no noticeable increase in communication range.

     OFF  FREQUENCY  OPERATION-  Illegal  out-of-band operation caused
     sizable headaches for the Commission enforcement personnel.  This
     will  never  be  the  case  with  the PUBLIC DIGITAL RADIO SYSTEM
     however. There is only one "channel" or band.  If, by some means,
     the  frequency  of a radio modem were lowered,  the data would be
     destroyed by amateur radio  transmissions.  If  it  were  raised,
     video information from TV channel 2 would do the same thing.

     TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

     The  "radio  modem"  (node  controller)  to be used in the PUBLIC
     DIGITAL RADIO SERVICE shall meet the following specifications:

     FREQUENCY BAND- Equipment authorized to  operate  in  the  PUBLIC
     DIGITAL   RADIO   SERVICE  shall  be  capable  of  receiving  and
     transmitting data within the band from 52.0 to 53.999 mHz.

     MODULATION- The data shall frequency modulate the  carrier  in  a
     frequency  shift  keyed  scheme.   Under  no  circumstances  will
     equipment authorized for use in the PUBLIC DIGITAL RADIO  SERVICE
     Fidonews                     Page 14                   2 Feb 1987


     have provision for voice modulation or detection.

     MODULATION AND SPURIOUS PRODUCTS-

     The data rate (see Note 1),  waveform and signal processing shall
     be such that all  products  which  fall  outside  the  authorized
     bandwidth  be  suppressed by 43 plus 10 log10 (mean output power,
     in watts) decibels.

     POWER OUTPUT- The power delivered by the  final  amplifier  stage
     into a 72 ohm load shall not exceed 1.0 watts. Further, the radio
     modem (node controller) shall have an initial power-up "training"
     mode. Upon power-up, the power output will be 1 milliwatt.

     The  power  will increase during "training" in 3 db.  steps until
     contact  is  established   with   nearby   radio   modems   (node
     controllers).  This  value  is  stored  in memory and becomes the
     nominal power output for the radio modem.

     ANTENNA- The antenna shall consist of a vertical  radiator  which
     does not exceed one-quarter wavelength. The antenna shall exhibit
     no  gain  or  directional  characteristics.  The antenna shall be
     supplied with a nominal length of coaxial cable.

     TRANSMITTER  IDENTIFICATION-  Each  radio  modem  shall  have  an
     embedded  identification  which  is  transmitted  as  part of its
     packet  address.  The  address  will  be  used  to  identify  the
     manufacturer,  the  serial  number  and  the  routing code of the
     equipment.

     PACKET CONSTRUCTION- The packet and destination address  will  be
     contained in the header.  The header will be constructed to limit
     the number of destination addresses. This is done to specifically
     preclude the transmission of "junk mail".

     REMUNERATION- Users of the PUBLIC DIGITAL RADIO SERVICE shall  be
     specifically  prohibited  from receiving any form of remuneration
     or compensation, either in the form of funds,  goods or services,
     for  handling  data on the PUBLIC DIGITAL RADIO SERVICE (see Note
     2).

     TYPE ACCEPTANCE- Type acceptance procedures, similar to those for
     Citizens Band equipment,  will be  required.  This  insures  that
     commercially  manufactured  equipment  used in the PUBLIC DIGITAL
     RADIO SERVICE meets the specified technical requirements for this
     service.

     NOTE 1- No data rate is given in these  proposed  specifications.
     It  should  be  left  to  industry  to  determine  the data rate.
     Schemes,  unknown to the writer or Commission,  may permit higher
     rates  within  the  authorized bandwidth than conventional theory
     would dictate.

     NOTE 2- The purpose of this provision is to prevent  the  use  of
     the  PUBLIC  DIGITAL  RADIO  SERVICE  for  the  benefit of common
     carriers.
     Fidonews                     Page 15                   2 Feb 1987


     The restriction should not be construed to preclude  the  use  of
     the  PUBLIC DIGITAL RADIO SERVICE for business applications.  For
     example,  the  radio  modem  would  be  extremely  useful  within
     buildings to avoid the need for local area network cabling. It is
     likely  the  signals  of an office radio LAN would not connect to
     the external PUBLIC DIGITAL RADIO SERVICE.

     The reader might envision that the service would  be  usurped  by
     the business community.  This is not likely,  however, due to the
     self-regulating nature  of  the  PUBLIC  DIGITAL  RADIO  SERVICE.
     Businesses  are  used  to  the  near  instantaneous  response  of
     telephone data communications.

     In comparison,  the message response of a packet radio network is
     relatively  slow.  Only  small businesses would find these delays
     tolerable. These are the same business which can least afford the
     increase in telephone rates.

     There is an analogy in the use of  the  Citizens  Band.  Numerous
     channels  are  available  and the equipment is quite inexpensive.
     Even so,  this band is seldom used for business  purposes.  There
     are simply too many disadvantages for the business community.

     CONCLUSION

     In  response to this petition,  the Commission may point out that
     there has been no popular  "groundswell"  to  create  a  computer
     radio  service.  Likewise,  there  was  no public interest in the
     creation of a television service in the 30's.  However,  in 1932,
     the  Commission  recognized  the  significance  of television and
     allocated two bands for development of this new technology.

     By the same token,  the Commission recognized the impact that  FM
     radio broadcasting would have on sound reproduction. In 1941 they
     allocated  an eight mHz band to bring high fidelity sounds to the
     public.

     In either  case,  there  was  very  little  awareness  that  such
     technologies were possible when the allocations were made.

     The  creation  of  a  PUBLIC  DIGITAL  RADIO  SERVICE  is another
     instance where the  Commission  could  take  the  initiative  and
     create a new service in keeping with current technology.

     International  Regulations- Since the allocation is above 50 mHz,
     it appears that no international treaties would  be  involved  in
     making the proposed allocation.  Rather,  it is likely that other
     countries would develop a similar service for their citizens.

     Amateur Radio Opposition- It is safe  to  assume  there  will  be
     sizable  opposition to this petition by amateurs.  The writer has
     been a radio  amateur  for  30  years.  During  this  period,  no
     permanent allocation has been "taken away" from the amateur radio
     fraternity.

     However, there can be no defense by amateurs of the inactivity on
     Fidonews                     Page 16                   2 Feb 1987


     6  meters.  A  reallocation  of  the  frequencies requested would
     benefit the majority at virtually no expense to the minority.

     Amateur  Radio  Collaboration-  The  principal  purpose  of  this
     petition  is  to  obtain  an  allocation  for  a  public computer
     communication band.  The writer would not  object  if  this  goal
     could  be  achieved  as  part  of the Radio Amateur Service.  The
     computer public would accept an administrative fee in return  for
     access  to the radio spectrum.  However,  they would never accept
     any sort of "testing" to achieve this goal.

     The writer would like to thank the Commission for the opportunity
     to submit this petition.  Further,  the  writer  appreciates  the
     consideration  this  petition  will receive by the members of the
     Commission.
