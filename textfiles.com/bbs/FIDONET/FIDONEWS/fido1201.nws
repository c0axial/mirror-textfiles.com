A new Echo, IM_HELP for discussions re: Intermail, the front end.

by William Scott Lockwood III
The new IM_HELP Echo

     Greetings and hallucinations!  There has been much hullabaloo
lately in the INTERMAIL echo.  About what?  Such things as E-Mail,
newbies sending messages to UUCP in our little echo, and various other
topics!  For weeks MANY people, including one of the authors have been
asking Lee Lefler the (supposed) current moderator to do something about
this!  So far, nothing...

     So now, I have decided a change is needed.  What kind of a
change?  We need a new echo.  For this purpose, I have registered a new
echo tag with the Elist.  This is IM_HELP.  It is basically for the
same purpose as the old INTERMAIL area with two notable exceptions:

     The first, is that there will be no unwarranted, unjustifiable
notices sent to your NEC demanding a feed cut.  I don't believe in this
kind of childish garbage, so *I* will not do it.  If you violate the
spirit of the echo, you will be invited to discuss it in netmail.  You
will receive at least 2 warnings AFTER that fails via DIRECT netmail
from me (or the current moderator.)  There will be no rules to this new
echo.  The moderator will have final say in any disputes.

     The second, is that with a different area tag, the number of
people posting mail to UUCP should stop!  This has become a source of
real irritation to all of us who actually try to use the echo for such
things as support and discussion.

     Finally, I need YOUR help.  I am the only system carrying this
echo as of this writing.  I feel that a change is needed for those of
us who wish to discuss or debate the use of the software we have paid
good money for without fending off the endless "Can I write to my aunt
selma in this echo?" messages from newbies, or dealing with a moderator
who stifles good discussion as soon as it starts by requesting feed
cuts with out even NOTIFYING the "Offending" node that the feed cut
is going to take place!  We need a good forum, and I know that IM_HELP
can be that forum.  So ask your NEC/REC/ZEC for this echo today!

Yours truly,
William Scott Lockwood III
IM_HELP moderator.

How Can We Get Users To Use The Message Bases?

How Can We Get Users To Use The Message Bases?
by Joe Shear @ 1:105/248 and yakimovs@ohsu.edu

One of the biggest frustrations I have as a SysOp when it comes to
users, is why won't they use the message bases?  I've asked dozens of
SysOps if they had any ideas on how to convince the users to use the
message bases, and no one ever replied so I guess they don't read
their mail either. :) Actually no one really ever had any.  You can
use message ratios, or ask users to post, or even offer a higher
security for posting, but usually all they do is post messages
saying "Hi.  My name is Joe Schmoe." or something to that effect.
How can we find the users who will use the message bases
intelligently?  Almost everyone should be able to find something they
like, whether it be door game support, conspiracies, sewing, or any
other hobby or subject.  There's even UseNet which has conferences
about everyone and everything.  So does anyone have any ideas about
how we can find a way to get users who will post intelligently to use
the message bases?  Please contact me if you do.

MailList - Perform Mailouts to mail lists

                              MailList.ZIP
                      Fredric L. Rice, December 1994
                      The Skeptic Tank (1:102/890.0)
                             (818) 335-9601

This program allows an individual to send network mail to a list of
individuals in FidoNet and Internet, complete with the ability to
FileAttach or FileRequest.  (It sends Internet mail to the
UUCP <==> FidoNet Gateway which you configure, dropping any
FileAttach or FileRequest in doing so.)

This is useful when you wish to broadcast a message to several
specific individuals around the networks, send them a file, or poll
them for a file.  Multiple mailing lists may be configured with any
number of individuals within it.

Care should be exercised with the use of this program as bombing
runs are considered annoying; MailList creates network messages
which are addressed direct to systems with provisions for flagging
them as Crash, IMMediate and DIRect.  Using the program to create
hundreds of messages which are then routed might be considered
excessivly annoying.  In addition, the program may be told to mail
_everyone_ in a subnet, allowing people within a subnet to be
informed of meetings and up-coming votes.  (If you abuse the program
I do hope that you get your ass spanked until tingly and lightly
pink or, if the abuse is too great, roasted until well done.)

-=-

This mailing list program may be FileRequested from The Skeptic Tank
24 hours a day using the name MAILLIST.ZIP.  It comes with the C++
source code in the event you feel the need to make some changes (or
port it to a bizzare foreign machine like an Amiga.)  The config
file which comes with the package along with the document file serve
to describe what the project is capable of doing.

The file is a bit over 35K zipped-up.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

What Is StormNet?

 StormNet is an alternative network for use with FidoNet
compatible software. We pass messages back and forth both in
netmail and in echomail conferences. In StormNet, each node is
welcomed and assisted in many ways by other StormNet members. We
have active echomail areas and a growing file echo selection.
Our echomail traffic is growing every day, and are now pulling
more mail ever than before. StormNet has a friendlier atmosphere
than can be found in many other networks.

FidoNews 12-01                 Page:  5                    02 Jan 1994

 StormNet has been in existence for over two years, and in that
time, has grown significantly. Our membership has changed from
an inexperienced group of local nodes to a more mature group of
people from all over the United States, Canada, Europe, and
Asia. Currently, we have over 350 nodes in StormNet, and are
expanding every week!

 * Why is StormNet here?

 StormNet was started for a few reasons. When we created it,
we wanted to serve teens, adults, and others worldwide with a
quality alternative network that is relatively cheap to pull in.
Most of our high speed transfers take less than a minute.
Although we prefer it, you don't have to poll every day, we are
flexible and will allow you to poll whenever you like. We want
to serve you with the finest quality echomail and files for you
and your users. We are considerably smaller than FidoNet, and
therefore do not have the overflow of mail/files often seen in
its conferences. The average cost per month for one who pulls
StormNet and polls daily is around $6.00-7.00 within the US.

 * What are the rules like?

 StormNet? Rules? You've got to be kidding me. Well, it's not
like we don't have any rules; all of the rules in our policy
statement basically stem from one basic principle - "Be nice and
use common sense." The policy's specifics were written to
outline some problems which may potentially arise when people
aren't nice and don't use common sense.

 The SNAC (StormNet Advisory Council) helps to ensure the
smooth  running  of  StormNet affairs.  StormNet does not
discriminate because of age, sex, national origin, religion,
sexual orientation, beliefs, taste in food, opinion on world
politics, or favorite color.  We welcome anyone  who  is
interested in joining a fun network to try out StormNet. We
also don't allow "bashing", spindling or other forms  of
mutilation of groups in our newsletters, or any of our echos
(excluding WAR_ZONE), and other parts of our network.

 * What are the echos like?

 We have a variety of conferences to suit most needs.  If you
are a user of StormNet, or a node, you can request an echo if
you feel it would be active. We have echos on many subjects, A
to Z (as we say SN_A to SN_Z). We have a talented staff of
moderators and co-moderators, and combined with the efforts of
our international echomail coordinator, keep the network running
smoothly.

 * Internet... Yes, Internet!

 StormNet is now registered in the domain  listings  as
"storm.net".  All StormNet nodes can use our UUCP host to send
messages anywhere on Internet at no additional cost to you.
FidoNews 12-01                 Page:  6                    02 Jan 1994


 * Vanity Internet addresses

 The StormNet International Internet Coordinator has  just
recently allowed a "vanity" name that you can apply for once you
join StormNet. This can be just about anything, and saves
typing.  For example, "John.Doe@johnsbbs.storm.net" is alot
easier to remember than "John.Doe@f104.n192.usa.storm.net."

 * Support

 StormNet has support sites for different types of software.
We currently have technical support nodes/echos for BinkleyTerm,
EzyCom, Maximus, Proboard, RemoteAccess, Storm Watch Software,
and T.A.G..

 New technical support nodes for other software are permitted
and encouraged. When you apply for technical support, you will
get a flag in the nodelist designating you as a support site.
You also get your name added to the list of technical support
nodes at the bottom of the nodelist. And finally, you have the
option to add file and message echos software you support.

 * What we're looking for

 StormNet is looking for nodes who want to pull in high quality
echomail at a relatively cheap price. Ones who think they would
like StormNet to be on their BBSes or computers.

 We also are looking for new zones to create all the time.
StormNet is not just limited to North America, other continents
and countries are already members, but we would like more. We'd
like to expand StormNet worldwide, and we think that everyone
would benefit from this and it would strengthen relations and
understanding between other nations.  It already has. With
European and Asian nodes, StormNet has a very unique atmosphere
where you will regularly chat with people not in the same
country, or continent as you. We are willing to work with you
to install a new zone in/on your country/continent.

 * Why should I consider StormNet?

 We respect each and every StormNet member and his/her rights.
We offer our services to all. We have a great network setup. We
want all to join and have a good time in the network that we
have created. We're proud of our network. We offer a unique and
quaint atmosphere not found on any other network. We guarantee
it.

 If you have any questions, comments, or problems, feel free to
contact any of the nodes listed below. We'd be glad to help you.

Original to: Charlie Munhollon (1:284/7)

cc: James Morris, Harry Spicer, Bob Satti, Tim Pearson, John Johnson
cc: Bruce Bodger, David Bowerman

To All;

  I am coming to you as the heads of the 284 net, and the
people in charge of Fido for Zone 1. This matter is very serious
and it is something that I take very personally. I would like to
request that I get a response to this from each of you.

  First I am not a Sysop in net 284, however I am the
Co-Sysop, and a major contributor to The Arc Angel Express BBS
Fido 1:284/7. I have been told in the past that because I run a
BBS in net 123 that I should stay out of net 284 problems. I
cannot do this anylonger. The actions of the people that are
attempting to control net 284, and there personal attacks of
node 1:284/7 have gone on far to long. I am with this message
issuing a formal policy complaint aginst ALL SYSOPS in net 284,
the current NC/NEC and others that are attempting to force 284/7
to give up his node number, and causing him to have to consider
dropping FIDO or applying for a regionl independent node number.
Also along with this compliant, I am issuing a notice that in my
opioion the powers that be in FIDO (namely thoose getting this
msg) are also in violation of policy in allowing this situation
in NET 284 to continue.

  This is what I understand to be taking place in net 284.
First the new NC and a group of his friends are trying to force
the NEC Harry Spicer to give up his position. Secound they are
trying to force Mr. Charlie Munhollon to give up his node number
because they want it for there own little group. There at this
time as NOT been a valid reason given for 1:284/7 to have to
change a node number that has been with The Arc Angel Express
from it's beginngs. Aprox 2-3 years. Third: The main reason the
attacks aginst 1:284/7 are being made is because this BBS offers
information about HIV/AIDS. It should be noted that this is
clearly DISCRIMINATION! This type of discrimination is coverd by
the Americans With Disablities ACT. Also the attacks are due to
the fact that 1:284/7 also offers suportive imformation for
persons that are GAY, Lesbian, or BI. This again is discrimitory
action.
FidoNews 12-01                 Page:  9                    02 Jan 1994


  Why? This is my simple question to everyone involved. Why?
If you don't give a damn about people that have HIV/AIDS, or you
disaprove of homosexuallity...then why call his BBS? How he runs
that BBS is his business. No one is forced to call. So you don't
like what is on the BBS, then leave his BBS alone. Give me a
valiad reason for attacking this BBS. Give me a reason for
attacking Harry. Who made the other sysop's in net 284 the GOD'S
of what a sysop could or could not offer on there BBS? As Long
as the sysop is running a system that is NOT ILLEGAL then no
OTHER SYSOP has the RIGHT to demand or dictate what is on that
system. How many sysop's in net 284 carry adult type networks?
Adultlinks, others, etc. How many offer files that some would
consider questionalbe? Before you attack someone else you should
examine your own house.

  As to my remarks about the ADA, as it is, I have AIDS, the
sysop of 1:284/7 has cancer. This puts both of us under the
protection of the ADA. I do not wish to make this a legal
battle. All I want is for 1:284/7 to be left alone. What ever
the problems in the net are...then solve them. But do it as a
group not as dictators. Mr.Munhollon will not take action aginst
anyone....he is not responsible for this message. However, I on
the other hand will TAKE ACTION. Let me make this very
clear....1:284/7 has been in operation for 2 or more years. I
have been invooilved witht he BBS for 1+ year. 1:284/7 will NOT
BE ATTACKED OR HASSLED again in any way by sysop's in net 284.
His node number will not be changed untill a valiad reason can
be presented and responded to. I want everyone to understand my
position. I have already made consultation with legal counseol,
and I will act under the ADA...if this  CLEAR  ACT  OF
DISCRIMINATION does not stop.  If anyone in net 284 has any
comments about this then they should be directed to me DIRECTLY
at 1:123/424. Do not send them to 1:284/7 as I am the one
responsible for this action. If you wish to verify my status as
co-sysop then please do so.

The following is a copy of the text of a msg from 1:284/7

Mr Johnson,

I am sorry to bother you again, but I need your assistance
please. Last tiem we "spoke" via mail you were advised of the
FidoNews 12-01                 Page: 10                    02 Jan 1994

situation here in Springfield. And the problems my system is
facing everyday. I am at this time recieving my mail with little
trouble persay. Also you had mentioned that I could bypass this
network altogather if needed. The local net situation has become
totaly unacceptable to me. Constant fighting and so forth,
little or no regard in association of respect toward one another
etc. I have plenty to deal with already on my board, this
network (284) is just more stress and problems I do not need.
Could you please advise me what steps are needed to become an
Independent Node???? I know that this is rare in happening, but
I feel that my options are to become an independent or drop Fido
net all togather. I have no desire to be associated with this
"type" of net any longer. I have systems outside of Net 284, and
a possibly 2 inside 284 that would be willing to provide my
system it's mail, so obtaining the feed is no problem. I
appreciate your assistance in this matter and thank you in
advance for any helpthat you can render.

Respectfully,

Charlie M.

New Canadian echo
by J.P.Beland, 1:243/41

C_ABILITY

The new Canadian Ability echo for persons with disabilities.

The purpose of this echo is to provide a communication link to Canadians
with disabilities so that they may discuss issues pertaining to persons
with disabilities living in Canada. Also information is provided that
can be useful to persons with disabilities in Canada.

The echo unites Canadians with disabilities.

Since December 18, 1994 the echo is on the Fido backbone.

Tape - Cut Tape Cassetts

                                Tape-1.ZIP

I have a program which records the titles, authors, and lengths of
the songs you have laying about the house which then allows you to
build tape cassetts from that information, keeping track of the
length of available time on cassetts you create.  It's useful for
when you wish to collect your records (remember those?) and CDs
onto tape cassett in a rational way without exceeding the length
of the tapes you wish to create.

Some of the functionality allows for the removal of a song from
your database which in turn causes the program to inform you which
of your tapes are affected.

Once you define tapes based upon the songs in your database, it
is up to you to produce a report on the tapes and physically dupe
them together; this program doesn't manipulate commercial hardware
packages which record tracks and cuts the tapes for you.

This program may be FileRequested from The Skeptic Tank 24 hours a
day using the name TAPE-1.ZIP.  It DOES NOT come with the C source
code.  If you're interested in getting the source code, drop me a
network message and I'll FileAttach it to a system of your choice.

allow it to use existing databases and barcodes.)

nodelist file you wish to scan, and produce a report on the nodelist
entries in that area code, sorted by the city.  It is useful for
offering individuals (users) a list of FidoNet systems which are in a
particular area code so that they might find systems which are local
to them.  It reports the city, system name, SysOp name, and the
telephone number only.

Entries which have duplicate phone numbers are excluded from the
report and the first occurance of the phone number entry is reported.
Entries with the CDN nodelist flags are excluded from the list.

New Echo: False Memory Syndrome

by David Bloomberg, 1:2430/1
FMS:  The False Memory Syndrome Echo

    Do huge satanic conspiracies pervade the country and abuse
children?  Are aliens regularly abducting people but forcing them
to forget all about it?  Do children routinely forget horrible
extended abuse perpetrated on them by their relatives?

    All of these claims stem from one source: Repressed memories.
There are therapists across the country who will tell you that they
can help "recover" these memories.  Numerous books have been written.
Some books encourage people to beieve that they've been abused, even
if there is no indication that any such thing ever happened.  New
books are coming out saying that these other books are full of
baloney, and that recovered memories are false memories.  Yet other
books are saying that claims of false memories are the baloney, and
that recovered memories are real.  So who is right?

    There are other echos on FidoNet which deal with some of these
claims specifically.  UFO, I_UFO, and BAMA deal with claims of alien
abductions, among others, and allow varying degrees of debate on the
subject, but they don't address all of the aspects of this phenomena.
There are numerous "survivor" echos, but none allow any form of
debate (to my knowledge), only "support" without "invalidating".
Unfortunately, many of those who believe in these phenomena consider
any questioning of claims or asking for evidence to be "invalidating".
Again, these also only address one aspect of the phenomena.

    So where can a FidoNetter go to discuss the entire gamut?  The
SKEPTIC echo is currently available, but frankly we don't want to
overflow that echo with one single topic, even though it is a very
FidoNews 12-01                 Page: 13                    02 Jan 1994

important topic.

    Well, now there is an echo specifically for discussion and debate
of all the aspects of this phenomenon.  The FMS echo (for False Memory
Syndrome) has been available for a couple months, and has been steadily
growing.  Now it's time to bring it up to the backbone.  For that we
need some more nodes.

    Here is the EchoList description of the FMS echo:

         This echo is for the discussion of False Memory Syndrome
         (FMS) and related topics, including those phenomena thought
         to be caused by FMS.  All viewpoints are welcome, both pro
         and con, but don't be surprised if you are asked to back up
         your claims with evidence. The implications of FMS, as well
         as the evidence, are on-topic.

    Yes, ALL viewpoints are welcome on the echo.  Please don't assume
that the echo tag of "FMS" means only the pro-FMS view is allowed.
This is a subject which needs to be critically and rationally examined;
there are already too many baseless claims flying around.

    People are being hurt by the "recovered" memories.  Not only the
parents and others who are accused, but also the patients.  If the
memories are untrue, their lives are being ruined.  If the memories
are true, we have a veritable epidemic on our hands and we have to
do something about it.

    The FMS echo is currently hubbed out of the founder/moderator's
node, The Temples of Syrinx, 1:2430/1.  It can also be obtained from
the following nodes: 374/14, 102/890, 124/9005, 130/911, and 268/102.

    For a copy of the rules, FReq FMS.RUL from 2430/1.  You might also
want to FReq FILES for my filelist, which includes over 100 files
related to FMS, many of which have been distributed on the FMS echo.
For the entire file set, FReq FMS, but be ready for an increase in
your long distance bill!

Article submitted by Aulton White 1:3645/30
FIDO Netmail, Why not allow users access?

Many Sysops do not allow users access to Netmail. Routed Netmail
would not cost the Sysop any more than normal. FIDO users would be
able to send and receive E-Mail easier than using Internet. With the
U.S. Postal Service raising rates and mail taking days to arrive,
FIDO Netmail would be a simple answer to the problem. It was put to
me that there may be legal problems if users depended on the FIDO
mail. As with Internet mail, a disclaimer can be posted to inform
users of policy. I understand that in the beginning FIDO was
basically an E-Mail network and echo came later. Well it may be the
time to go back to basics. Some current problems with Internet are:
FidoNews 12-01                 Page: 14                    02 Jan 1994


Access is not easily available to many users.

Addressing system of Internet is not simple.

The Internet Super highway is becoming more like a traffic Jam.

Cost can be another problem.

just to name a few.

With FIDO net In place and working rather well, it makes sense to
utilize the system to be a public service. Access too many local
BBS's will give users access to an international E-Mail system that
will simplify life. Even with prepaid crash mail the cost would be
cheaper than the U.S. Postal Service. The media has not seen the
power FIDO net as available now. With over 25,000 nodes world wide
FIDO may have the largest access availability. If the sysops in FIDO
work together we could make the FIDO network a household word.

I am trying to get Sysop's to send me a list of BBS's (node numbers)
by city and state that allow users access to Netmail. In this list
there should be a list of access fees and/or if prepay crash mail
access is available. With this information available users can
establish an address for their mail. This could increase user use on
BBS's and put FIDO in the spotlight. With monthly updates available
in ZIP, ARJ, or LHA format, users could have access to any node in
the world. With the use of off-line mail readers and points, FIDO
E-Mail access would be very easy to use.

If anyone is interested in this and wants to get this thing going,
contact me by netmail at 1:3645/30 or 1:3645/31(business node).

Dear Snooz Editorbeings,

Please indicate that the following is submitted by Charles
Herriot (1:163/110) so that Dallas' second last working
neuron doesn't explode  trying to figure this out. The
missive arrived, engraved on a coconut, and reeked of Giant
Clams. Roll da flic, Sylvia...

Swamp Swine Magazine,
Shuckmagosh, Ohio

Dear Reverend Visage,

Thank Elvis, you have returned to the land of the living...
so to speak. The plaintive baaing of your flock was
beginning to annoy the neighbours  and the Snooz editors
were getting ugly about paying some of your petty cash
vouchers. Incidentally, thank you for sending my address to
all of the Johannes. They arrived in a fearful state of
undress, considering the harsh weather, and it has taken all
FidoNews 12-01                 Page: 15                    02 Jan 1994

week to warm them up. (Unfortunately, a technical matter,
trying to get an old box to work, caused me to send the
Johannes back out into the cold.)

Since this is being written on the last day of 1994 I feel
obliged to sum up the year in some fashion and to make
predictions about the coming year. (First off, there is no
doubt that in 1995, a Grammy will be awarded for "Best
Contribution to Rock & Roll"... to Kurt Coblain's shotgun.)

In the closing days of 1994, Region 12 was blessed by new
depths of insanity, what with the gendarmes paying an xmas
morning visit to Barry "Tourette's Poster Child" Carter as a
result of a harassment complaint filed by the NC250, James
"Mom, Mom, He Called Me a Bad Word" Korolas. Charming...
absolutely charming. These people really know how to party
and remain unswayed by the peace&goodwill sentiments which
usually pour forth in this season. I suggest sending at
least a case of Glow-in-the-dark Jesus night lights to these
barbarians so that they can be saved.

Not to be outdone, the NC259 threatened to sue the owner of
a Planetary bird bath dish who had been providing an
echomail feed at no cost to net259. The NC259, Lil' Bryan
Federowski thought that unleashing legal weaseling would be
an appropriate form of thanks. Three lumps of coal for Lil'
Bryan, I say, and may the fresh Pampers be with him.

Even more amusing, the Duddy Grimspam of Net243, Chris "Give
Me Money, honey" Weisner, went ballistic when his toll booth
brigandry on the information highway was undercut by cheaper
and better service from the REC. Chris has been a pioneer in
the commercialization of Fidonet. Our pennies and our edible
underwear should go out to him in his hour of deprivation.

I am almost certain to provoke a volley of Thorazine tipped
darts from your direction if I mention our RC, Rick "46 days
of Ignomy & Ignorance Left to Go" Johnston, but this is a
good news kind of tidbit. For the *eighth" time this year,
Rick has successfully submitted the nodediff segment.
Whoever said that you couldn't teach amoebas new tricks?

We haven't heard from Bob "Bob" Satti, which was not
surprising considering that he must surely be huddled with
Dallas Hinton and other similarly enlightened RCs, trying to
muster the collective skills to figure out how to use an
electric can opener so that they don't starve to death. If
anyone out in Fidoland happens to know the date when the
conclave of cardinals lofted Satti into the ZC position,
Swamp Swine Magazine would appreciate a netmail. We'd like
to start the death-watch on his inglorious term of office.

I recognize that this is just one more example of my
depraved condition, but it just wouldn't seem right to let a
year end go by without tilting at my favourite windmill. For
FidoNews 12-01                 Page: 16                    02 Jan 1994

reasons which even escape me, I've been gathering statistics
for years on the ratios between original text and quoted
text in messages. You'll be delighted to know that the
average echomail conference now contains slightly more than
30% quoted text, as opposed to approx. 25% a year ago. This
is probably engendered by the advent of all of those
dumbshit Internet macros that technoweenies append to every
message and which get quoted by the thinking impaired in
each response. Fidonet communication ( I use the word
loosely) by the year 2000 will consist of smallish grunts
followed by pages of quoted material. To all of the the
software authors who wrote programs making it easy to quote
messages: May you be condemned to spending months with John
Denver listening to him sing "Rocky Mountain High." I think
there will be a special irony involved with the fact that in
years to come, the BIKERSLUTS echo will probably be the last
meaningful echo in all of Fidoland.

I must go Visage. Ms. Labamba has returned, albeit with a
seraphic glow on her face. She has become insistent that I
 *do* something about the penguins which established a
rookery in her filing cabinet. She claims that she can't
concentrate with the smell of fish pervading the room. I
suggest that we offer her a a de-scented guppy as a peace
offering.
