Editorial: See you at FidoCon '91!
Tom Jennings

This is a special, truncated FidoNews, published on Wednesday, instead
of Sunday, since the entire editorial staff (doesn't that sound officious?)
is off to FidoCon in about seven hours. Tim Pozar and I will be driving
out in my ancient Rambler, searching out LPG sources along the way (it's
not so bad, actually, and I just did this very thing only a few weeks ago).

ANYWAYS -- to reiterate something I mentioned weeks ago -- FidoNews needs
your writeups on FidoCon. If you are attending, please if you can bear it,
write about what you see -- sessions attended, rumors heard, decisions
made, products seen, fights, events like the annual hard-disk toss (it gets
easier and easier every year... in 1980 it would have been Shugart 14"
fixed Winchesters... this year it's probably a 2.5" somethingorother).
Chances are, if you sat through the whole thing it's probably of
excuciating interest to someone else. Tell the world! (Well, our corner of
it.)

Read ARTSPEC.DOC, it's not very demanding, and mail 'em in! Bye!

FidoNews Version List Notification...

It has been brought to my attention in some of the Fido Echos and in
NetMail that the FidoNews Version List has grown to a large size.
That's the main reason Tom put the job up for volunteers.  I was
picked from the "hat," so to say...<g>

A couple of alternatives I have had suggested to me have been...

A) Split the List.  Publish one or two system lists a week,
   alternating.

B) Delete old listings.

Until the end of September I an soliciting for ideas on how to handle
consolidating the Version List.  At that time I will make a decision
and the September 30 FidoNews will show the results.  Please direct
all suggestions to 1:103/950 via NetMail.

It has also been pointed out that some of the software listed is not
really easy to find.  I would like to implement a rotating list of
Main Support Boards for Software(e.g. RA 1:1/120, Binkley 1:1/102,
etc.)   This would take up a bit of space, but it would also help
the new Sysop in finding some of the hard to get items.

The details still need to be worked out and suggestions are welcome.

PS..  LET'S ALL HELP TAKE A BITE OUT OF THE NODELIST BY
USING HUB ROUTING, AND KEEP IT DOWN TO A REASONABLE SIZE.


----------------------------------------------------------------------


Pace University is running a bulletin board for students,
potential students and the general public. The BBS software
being using is TRITEL, with SEAdog as a front end. A MAXUM
3016D computer is acting as the host with 8 mb of memory.
A total of 252 mb's assures ample storage.

One of the unique features of this system is the fact that
callers may request catalogs and class information about
course being given at Pace, simply by filling out a short
questionnaire on-line. First time callers have access to
the questionnaire, so there is NO delay in asking for
information.

In addition, THE INFORMATION CENTER (TM) has a very large
selection of shareware from ASP authors, a complete Netware
386 file library and over fifteen doors. As a courtesy to
the author of TRITEL, all of the files needed to run this
very nice bulletin board are kept on-line for downloads.

YOU are welcome to call (212) 346-1289 from 7 a.m. to
3 a.m.(EASTERN TIME), 7 days a week. TRITEL is a complete
BBS with a fantastic user interface that is easy to use.
TRITEL has Zmodem built in so file transfers are efficient.

Another Suggestion about Reducing the Size of the Nodelist



A recent topic of discussion in FidoNews has concerned how to make
the nodelist smaller.

FidoNews 8-33                  Page 5                      26 Aug 1991


I propose changing the baud rate, CM, MO, LO, V21, V22, V29, V32,
V32b, V33, V34, V42, V42b, MNP, H96, HST, MAX, PEP, CSP, XA, XB, XC,
XP, XR, XW, and XX flags to one-digit codes beginning with "1" in
each of their fields.

For example, in the Special Operating Conditions field,
"CM" would become "1" (without the quotations, of course)
"MO" would become "2"
"LO" would become "3"

and in the Modem Capabilities field,
"V21" would become "1"
"V22" would become "2"
.
.
.
"MNP" would become "A"
"H96" would become "B"
etc. etc.


I hope this clearly demonstrates what I mean about how the
numbering would start "with 1 in each of their individual fields".


These changes would be short and simple, and so is this article.  If
you send netmail, I will attempt to reply but cannot promise that you
will receive it.
