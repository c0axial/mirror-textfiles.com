                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================

     Due to a program error that didn't appear in the test runs, but then
     decided to appear on publication, there was no Editorial last week.
     Given some of the things that happened within 24 hours of the issue
     being published, it gave some time to reflect a bit more on these.

     Scary news out there...and no one seems to want to talk about it.

     There comes a point in any organization where the future is
     determined by either the goals of the group as a whole, or by a small
     cadre of people who have a 'vision' of the way things should be.

     Too often, however, the two factions clash, and it is the helpless
     villagers, or sysops in this case, who will end up bearing the brunt
     of the struggle.

     The Z2C has openly challenged the process of "One Zone, One Vote" in
     the coming IC Election, more than casually mentioning that the fact
     of Zone 2 being in control of 65% of FidoNet, and insinuating, from
     what is said, that Zone 2 should have a 'larger' role in choosing the
     IC if not actually controlling that choice.

     I would also point out why the lessons of history in this regard
     should be more apparent to Zone 2 than most...but I think I will
     refrain.

     Already, there is a 'complaint' that Zone 1 members are "ruining" the
     access to the ZCC-PUBLIC echo...but it would seem that this is more
     geared at the "lack of respect" tone of the messages.  That, and the
     point that no rules have been posted for that echo, either.

     If you can't get access to ZCC-PUBLIC, ask "Why not?"

     Notably absent is the Z2C's weekly "doomsday countdown" for the
     nodelist for which I have received a complaint from him.  While he
     admits to having posted it publicly in many echoes worldwide,
     it appears that the FidoNews was not to post it unless he himself
     sent it in, with his specific permissions and consent.

     As of publication time the past two weeks, he has not sent it, either
     by NetMail or by E-Mail; thus, it will not be included per his
     objections.

     So much for 'open communications'.  Strange, also, that the issue of
     copyrights comes in so conveniently for him now, no?

     In any event, and in response to a number of complaints I have
     received both long before I became Editor and since that time, I have
     chosen to now use a PGP-signature to insure the integrity of each
     issue of FidoNews.

     The complaints were that several Region and Net level coordinators
     seem to be removing articles that did not "fit in" with a particular

     FIDONEWS 15-12               Page 2                   23 Mar 1998


     view that they held.  Copies were sent to me that indicated anything
     from removal of the printer breaks to whole articles being removed.

     Think of it as a 'certified uncensored issue' seal of approval.
     To properly check the signature, remove five (5) spaces from the
     beginnings of the PGP-signature lines.  This is due to a formatting
     matter in the publishing program that can't be presently modified.

     Last issue's article by Jim Cannell, the administrator of the
     SecureMail services in FidoNet, was intended to 'de-mystify' the use
     of PGP encryption and make it more accessible to the general public.

     As always, there is the issue posting at http://www.fidonews.org, or
     at my personal site at http://209.77.228.66/fidonet.html .

     Would that we could all live in a world where this was unnecessary,
     but there are those who live to turn our hobby into their existance.

     Other than the usual, this issue of the FidoNews is remarkably light.
     Some updates to the InterNet sites, and a few more articles.

     ...and an interesting E-Mail from Romania.

     Remember, the FidoNews is what _you_ make of it.

     Passing thoughts
     by David Hallford

     As I take a well deserved vacation my mind started to dwell on how I
     would do things in Fidonet. These aren't the best ways or the
     smartest ways, or even the correct ways. Just the way I would do it.

        ELECTIONS: Hmmm, a good thought on the surface but what is the
        real consensus within Fidonet. No one knows. Each side of the
        dispute is so busy arguing for their view point that no one has
        taken the time to check with the SysOps. Why not have the ZC's
        task the RC's to task the NC's to poll their networks and report
        back by node number who wants or doesn't want elections to be the
        standard.  If elections win the vote of the Sysops then use the
        same procedure to determine if it should be by popular vote or
        representation (ie the Sysop's elect the NC/NEC, the NC/NEC elect
        the RC/REC, the RC/REC elect the ZC/ZEC) and what the length of
        each term should be. If the Sysops want the appointment route to
        be the standard, then let it. This will end a lot of the bickering
        current within Fidonet.

        ECHOPOL: Why? It seems to be working to me. It's now a cooperative
        effort between moderators, routers, and SysOps. A bad moderator
        gets ignored, a bad router gets routed around, and a bad SysOp
        gets a feed cut. No rules or regulations to fight over. Let's face
        it, we have been arguing over Policy 4.07 for 10 years or so.
        There are still folks who interpret it their way even in the face
        of rulings by the ZC.  Why add more regulations to argue over? At
        the most I would have a policy that defined the positions and
        terms used but granted no additional power to anyone.


        ECHOMAIL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS: The more the merrier, I say. Those
        that serve the folks will survive. Those that don't - won't.
        I can't think of a better way to regulate them!

        EXCESSIVELY ANNOYING BEHAVIOR (in echomail): Why not?  A lie is a
        lie if it's in echomail or netmail. Character assassination can be
        worse in an echo than it can be in netmail. I would like it to be
        possible to file a Policy 4 complaint against folks who accuse
        others of being someone elses puppet (or clone) without proof.
        Most of us think for ourselves, so why do we think others don't?
        Just because they agree with someone on an issue doesn't make them
        puppets.  I agreed with some things that Ho Chi Minh said.  That
        sure doesn't make me his puppet since I would have gladly put a
        bullet in his brain had the opportunity ever presented itself.

        NICE FOLKS (and those not so nice):  Some people cause me to stop
        and think over a position or stance I have taken. Some nicely and
        some not so nicely. It doesn't matter because I owe them thanks
        for causing me to think. Bob Satti was the nicest and Tom Cole was

     FIDONEWS 15-12               Page 4                   23 Mar 1998


        the least nicest, but I owe them both my thanks.  I will not say
        who I feel are nice or not nice, but I would like to thank the
        following for a fun 11 years:

             Bob Satti, Bob Kohl, Bob Moravsik, Bob Seaborn (geez how many
             Bobs are there?) Martin Belcke, Brenda Donovan, Russ Edwards,
             David Bowerman, Bruce Bodger, John Souvestre, Mike Murray,
             Ruth Argust, Zorch Frezberg (as if I would forget him <g>),
             Andy Brown (in fact all of the NECs past and present in R10),
             Tom Cole, Joe Jared, George Peace, Ken Wilson, Adrian Walker,
             John Pfieffer, Dennis Travis, Gerry Calhoun, the dwarves in
             Mindless Chatter and Drivel, and all the folks who take the
             time to read the Fidonews and participate in Fidonet on a
             vocal level (whether I agreed with you or not).

     As the man said "Goodbye and thanks for the fish". I liked that one
     and think Fidonet should adopt it as the 'official' goodbye.

        Goodbye, and thanks for the fish!

     Just a short announcement - The World-Wide-Web Fidonet Resource
     is now at the URL below:

        http://travel.to/fidonet

     This location will redirect you to the current 'real' home
     of the WWWFR, which is currently is still
     http://www.scms.rgu.ac.uk/students/cs_yr94/lk/fido.html
     but is likely to change in the future. If you use the new
     URL the change will not be noticed...

     I'm also planning a number of changes to the site, I
     fancy getting my hands dirty with a bit of Perl. If I want
     to add cgi-bin enhancements then i'll be looking for a
     new home for the page - anyone care to offer a UNIX
     account with telnet/ftp access? ;)

     Dear Editorbeing,

     This article is submitted by Charles Herriot (163/110) who
     managed to rescue Doc Logger from a pack of ravening Echopol
     police. Apparently, Logger's penchant for BBSing to the
     accompaniment of bagpipe music was not only in bad taste,
     but was also a serious Fidocrime.

     Roll da' flic Zorch....

     Dear Reverend Visage,

     The fact that you have been ignoring your flock in their
     hour of need has been made more obvious in recent days.
     Despite the hopes that Echopol evangelists could be
     eradicated shortly after Smallpox, the usual suspects are at
     it again. It seems that a new version of Echopol is being
     bruited by Bob Kohl. He doesn't seem to understand that
     arming small intellects with more policy is certain to
     engender many unhappy years of "Policy complaints" with the
     document being used to torture unsuspecting Fidoserfs. A
     tadge more alarming is the fact that Bob has expressed
     concerns about the content of echos which he feels need to
     be controlled by policy.

     As the good and decent people that we are, all appropriate
     energy should be devoted to teaching Mr. Kohl where to find
     the <RETURN> button on his keyboard so that he can skip past
     the messages that would otherwise make him cry. It boggles
     the mind to imagine what the socially maladroit will do with
     a new blunt instrument in the form of Echopol. If a fellow
     like Gary Gilmore can screech from his perch in New Zealand
     about a nodelisting in North America, think of what fun his
     ilk will have if given a chance to whine about what is
     written in the echos. I wish Bob no joy at all in his
     Echopol endeavours and may the farce be with him.

     All six loyal readers of the Snooz might have noticed the
     ominous heading last week: 'The Coming Civil War" and been
     mightily puzzled that it was followed by a puff piece
     lauding the sainthood of our ZC, Bob Satti. Only the unkind
     will snicker at the irony that the same gushy accolades were
     contained in a letter wherein the author says good-bye to
     Fidoland.

     I think perhaps what was being hinted at in the Civil War
     reference was the ongoing debate among the ZC elflords about
     who should be kicked upstairs to the IC position. Ward
     Dossche, the ZC2, has apparently asserted that the ZC's
     should be granted weighted voting according to how many
     Fidoserfs they "rule" in their fiefdoms. I haven't noticed

     FIDONEWS 15-12               Page 6                   23 Mar 1998


     that Ward is insisting that he go whole hog with his
     democratic sedition and have *all* Fidoserfs actually vote,
     but he gets at least half marks for effort.

     Mr. Dossche's excitable detractors are predicting ruin and
     damnation should his concepts prevail. Naturally, the Z1C,
     Bob Satti has expressed grave concerns about conducting the
     debate in public. Evidently, Satti is not the least bit fond
     of having his machinations scrutinized by those he presumes
     to rule.

     On that cheery note, I'll segue into my Chautauqua which is
     as much addressed to Satti as it is to all five of the other
     regular Snooz readers. I'd like to lead off with a quote
     from Walter Lippmann in an essay entitled "The Indispensable
     Opposition."

     "The opposition is indispensable. A good statesman, like any
     other sensible human being, always learns more from his
     opponents than from his fervent supporters. For his
     supporters push him to disaster unless his opponents show
     him where the dangers are. So if he is wise he will often
     pray to be delivered from his friends, because they will
     ruin him.  But, though it hurts, he ought also to pray never
     to be without opponents; for they keep him on the path of
     reason and good sense."

     So, as one of Mr. Satti's most fervent opponents, might I
     tender some advice with respect to the creation of Echopol?
     If the policy document is created, and if the framers are
     permitted to presume authority for it or vested by it, there
     will be less than a year elapsed before another *C vs. *EC
     battle erupts. There will also be legions of trolls who
     attempt to use the document for reasons which have nothing
     to do with the smooth flow of mail. The ZC's netmail will
     runneth over with new policy complaints, and if Satti
     remains true to his past decisions, he'll amaze the
     Fidoserfs with more amazingly dumb decisions.

     I must go Visage. Your secretary is in grim shape. She
     claims that Bill Clinton didn't try to hug her. "Am I the
     only one?" she bleats, over and over. As a gesture of our
     concern for her, I suggest we send her on  a skiing holiday
     with either the Kennedy or the Bono families.

     Originally published       Vol.11  No.26    (27-Jun-1994)
     (with some '98 revisions by the author)

     POLICY 33.5 - THE FINAL INSULT
     Charles Herriot  (1:163/110)
     (this had to be done, Doc, now where's my Ibogaine?)

     1. TITLE: (amateur policymongers probably don't realize the
     importance of leading off with at least one "tit"... capture
     their imaginations and their hearts and minds will follow)

     The title of this document shall be:

      "Policy 33.5 - The Final Insult,

      otherwise known as:

      "Mom! Mom! He/she dissed me and I'm gonna whump his/her
     sorry ass with this policy document until he/she either
     apologizes or else gets locked in a room and is forced to
     listen to John Denver singin' 'Rocky Mountain High' until
     her/his ears bleed."

     2. PURPOSE: The purpose of this policy is to create more
     policy. The Region has recognized quite clearly that if more
     policy were created then, incredibly, we'd have more policy.
     If we had more policy, then we would definitely need even
     more of it to expand upon the previously created policy.
     Hell, in no time at all, this policy stuff would be breeding
     on its own and provide sustenance to unemployed cod
     fisherman.

     3. DEFINITIONS:

     AcetyleneMail: The polite staple of inter-sysop
     communication which must include, at a minimum, at least one
     demand that the recipient engage in an act of
     self-replicating his/herself. It is entirely appropriate to
     substitute the preceding with a suggestion to the recipient
     that they engage in an act of procreation with anyone having
     the surname: "Off."

     Cod: Humiliated trout. Not to be confused with the
     traditionally refrain of grunt sysops to *C-beings  which
     loosely paraphrases into: "Who named you Cod?"

     Beer: The official sysop monetary unit. Debts can be
     satisfied upon payment of these units, and *C-beings are
     obligated to buy grunt sysops copious quantities of this
     particular resource.

     CRPs: Mistakenly identified as "Cost Recovery Plans", these
     are really guileless attempts to extort money from Grunt
     Sysops. The money is expended on fast women and loose cars.

     Echomail: A system of distributing the latest gnarly-rad
     path lines, and logoff macros, by "K00L D00DZ" which are
     rivaled by Sea Slugs for their intrinsic wit. Also, any
     quote of the preceding is considered "echomail" and the high
     fibre content helps to improve echomail regularity.
     Humungous amounts of megabytes of this stuff are
     sporadically sent throughout the Region. All of this
     echomail was spawned by one message which was entered in
     1985 and everyone has been quoting the hell out of it ever
     since.

     EchoPol: Any policy document which is written by confused
     and bored trolls who don't realize that putting policy into
     the hands of children will almost always lead to
     self-inflicted injuries.

     Grunt Sysops: A strange infestation which has plagued
     Fidonet for years. No one has figured out what sort of toxic
     spray would be effective in eliminating them. The freshly
     hatched sysop-beings, shortly before mastering the basic
     skills of mailers and echomail distribution, plaster
     messages all over the known universe announcing yet another
     new net.. one that promises some feature so outstanding that
     it probably isn't replicated in more than 500 of the
     existing 600 Fidonet echomail areas.

     Hubs: Dwarf-like creatures who live in tinfoil lined,
     darkened caves, where their multi-node, Lan-based, 69
     gazillion baud modems, poot forth echomail. Hubs are
     recognizable from the fact that their plastic pocket pen
     protector mounted pagers beep whenever they receive an
     inbound mail packet. Hubs secretly dream about bringing the
     entire Sports Illustrated Swimsuit modeling group to gaze at
     the diode arrays winking from every corner of their
     kleenex-piled rooms.

     NECs: Pituitary challenged Hubs who can often run a mailer
     for almost a whole day without having the system crash. NECs
     spend hours explaining batch files to bored and miserable
     people everywhere. NECs have LAN work-stations in  their
     bathrooms where they do their best work.

     Nets: Nets are largish containment devices used to bag
     various *Cs who have run amok. These are not to be confused
     with "Network" which is also herein defined.

     Netwar: An exchange of pleasantries between sysops
     culminating in at least a dozen threats of policy
     complaints, filled diapers, and about 20 megs of brainlessly
     quoted text.

     FIDONEWS 15-12               Page 9                   23 Mar 1998


     Networks: Are collections of nodes who have mastered the
     incredible mentation powers to remember the same sequence of
     digits. Networks are loosely centred on geographic areas
     within easy mortar range of each  other.

     Network Coordinators: (see also "Mazola & Bondage") Network
     Coordinators are selfless individuals who are reluctantly
     railroaded into wearing a large bullseye on their foreheads
     for the amusement of grunt sysops who are bored and have
     already painted the cat.

     Region: Regions are hard-fought geographic fiefdoms ruled
     by RCs who are renowned for exchanging grapeshot whenever
     they fell that their turf is being poached by an adjacent
     region. Regions are defined in a manner akin to the
     following (which happens to be Region 12):

     The region shall encompass that area in Canada lying
     to the east of the Manitoba border (unless they lower their
     taxes and sell cheaper beer) and continuing past the welfare
     states in the Atlantic provinces to whichever dead cod
     happen to wash up on the beaches of Sable Island. The Region
     shall also include the Free Republic of Quebec, but only
     insofar as it does not impinge upon their God-given right to
     rant endlessly about their contused and paranoid cultural
     identity. The region shall extend as far northward as the
     North Pole and proceed to a depth (drilling straight
     downwards) that includes selected parts of Malaysia.

     Regional Coordinators: The larval stage of Small Animal
     Psychologists. These beings are to be humoured and indulged
     since their are obligated to buy rounds of beer for all
     sysops at social gatherings. Regional Coordinators can be
     identified by the horrible sucking noises they make while
     applying Vulcan lip-locks to the ZC's nether bits. After
     weeks of sheep and sleep deprivation, these poor souls can
     be spotted, buck naked in the moonlight, howling for more
     policy.

     Technical Standards: A basepoint for launching into some
     sort of penis-envy type message comparing baud rates, how
     many terrabytes of online GIFS can be shot through the phone
     lines, or how some moron has pissed away a small fortune on
     a Pentium chip so that they can display messages at 14
     million times their visual comprehension rate. I mean, let's
     face it, if you happen to have cute blossooms, nobody is
     going to give a damn whether your mailer works... in an
     ideal world, your mail would get hand-delivered.

     Users: Like, get serious wouldja? Screw 'em if they can't
     take a joke.

     ZCs: Self-idolatrous Fido elflords who wake up each morning
     imbued with the erroneous belief that they know what's good
     for the network. Other than tossing them a few slabs of raw
     meat, these individuals should be given adult supervision
     if they attempt anything more complicated than waking up in
     the morning.

     4. Official Titles:

     In this Region, a group of sick minds will choose some
     relatively innocent soul and propel the poor sucker into the
     job of Regional Co-ordinator. The Regional Coordinator shall
     have all the powers biologically granted to bread mold, but
     otherwise can be safely ignored.

     The Region shall be hacked up into small fiefdoms, called
     "Networks" which shall elect mascots, order pizza in bulk
     quantities, and participate in the annual Node Draft to
     choose the players for the upcoming Netwar season. Nets will
     dragoon someone into being the Network Coordinator who will
     be obliged to either undergo spontaneous human combustion
     before a full term is served, or else stand for re-election
     to the particular purgatory for which they are ideally
     maladapted.

     Network Coordinators will not be surprised to discover that
     they commune directly with either God or if they want to
     sink right to the bottom; to Bob Satti.

     Network Coordinators are entitled to screech that "they need
     a really big net." Judging from their post electoral
     behaviour, most grunt sysops would agree with their
     appraisal, and might further suggest a cell of the padded
     variety as well.

     Any grunt sysop who has stood in the blinding white light of
     their own ego too long is entitled to pile nine or ten
     listings of their own number into the nodelist and appoint
     themselves as Net Coordinator. They will be entitled to
     exhibit multiple-personality disorderly conduct and
     pontificate about "what their net wants." Spray misting
     these lost souls with regular doses of crystal-meth is
     advised.

     5. Elections: Anyone who actually wants a title in Fidonet
     should be put in a bottle and sent out into the Japanese
     current. If their lives are so incomplete without the fame
     of a Fidonet title, then they should be encouraged to get
     their pictures on milk cartons, but don't elect the poor
     bastards because they'll inflict bad grammar on you until
     you lie in a pool of drool, clutching your "I Adore My 64"
     button, babbling about the good old days when men were men
     and sheep were not particular.

     6. The Netwar Season: The netwar season shall commence
     nanoseconds after the election of each new Regional
     Coordinator. A season can be kick-started to a promising
     beginning by any Regional Coordinator who campaigns on some
     sort of "peace" platform. Like, nudge nudge, wink wink, we
     all *deplore* the fights in hockey games, so we'll be sure
     to take these kind of lame promises just as seriously.

     (snicker)

     FIDONEWS 15-12               Page 11                  23 Mar 1998


     (Incidentally, don't trust any candidate who quotes Arlo
     Guthrie in "Alices Restaraunt" and says "I wanna kill. I
     wanna kill. I mean, I wanna see blood and guts and veins in
     my teeth. I wanna kill. KILL! KILL!" because  these are the
     kind of milquetoasts that probably brake for whales and will
     screw up a perfectly good netwar season with their puerile
     sniveling for calm. C'mon, fess up... you tryna tell me that
     you forked out five grand for a BBS system that was just
     gonna bring in the DOGTALK echo?

     At the beginning of each season, grunt sysops will make
     irrational decisions about who they hate at the moment, and
     will bounce up and down in their cribs, asking to be picked
     by their most favoured Network Coordinator. Top draft
     choices will always be those sysops who are prepared to
     nitpick the hell out of issue that occurred way back in the
     late fifties.

     Network Coordinators should not ignore the "specialty teams"
     that make netwars so fascinating. Getting one of those
     tight-assed weenies who quotes every obscenity that comes
     down the turnpike and then appends some cloacally-challenged
     moralizing, should be counted as almost as important as the
     wankers who brag that they are the very first to be running
     the "new" Fido Version 1.01 software. The latter can be be
     guaranteed to smoke out some peckerwood who counter-brags
     that he/she has been running that version for three
     nanoseconds longer.... under Windows, no less.

     A truly successful Netwar season can be measured by the
     logarithmic expansion of new nets, and the number of
     excitable, intrigue-filled, messages that Zorch and
     John write.

     7. The Stirring Conclusion: Just as this policy document was
     about to end. Just as Luke in his X-wing fighter was about
     to drop the Neutron bomb down the exhaust shaft and put this
     puppy out of it's misery. Just as the Bikersluts were about
     to perform peculiar ablutions in the lap of the good Rev.
     Visage. Just as your RETURN button was begging for mercy
     like some spaghetti flogged, Jesse Hollington -type
     combination fax machine and gratification device... just at
     that moment... a rock fungus will burst it's spore pod and
     some flatlined-on-the-EEG sysop will suggest that "we really
     oughta have lots more policy."
