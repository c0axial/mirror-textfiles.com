     =================================================================


     We got a lot of .JOK and .CMX files this week. We also got a good
     response to last week's Question of the Week. Those responses have
     initiated the creation of a new section called Answers of the Week
     which appears in this Issue for the first time.

     Keep 'em coming! [grin]

     I have also updated ARTSPEC.DOC to include this new section
     FILENAME.TYP [.ANS] as well as adding an instruction to the message
     submission detail and correcting a couple other minor points. The
     update is included in this issue as the first article. It was also
     hatched out into SDS area SOFTDIST as ARTSPEC.ZIP and into the
     FIDONEWS file Echo as ARTSPEC.DOC along with this Issue of FidoNews.
     As always, it is also available on the FidoNews Webpage and by
     file-request to 1:1/23 [1:18/14] by filename or magicname of ARTSPEC.
     See the Masthead information at the end for addresses.

     Next week, I will begin publishing the FidoNet Technical Standards on
     a space-available basis. FTS-0001 is 65K so it will be most of next
     week's Issue. The others are much shorter and may appear in bunches.
     After all the FTSs have been published, the FSCs [standards
     proposals] will appear regularly. Another new section will be created
     for these publications to set them apart. Developers are welcome to
     submit their proposals for FidoNews publication using the filename
     extension of: .FTC .

     I'm still looking for some .BIO submissions from all you lurkers. You
     don't have to be famous or infamous to tell on yourself. Don't be shy.

     There aren't any ghost stories here to make this a Halloween Issue but
     we do have a Jack-o-Lantern courtesy of Dave Aronson. [grin]

     Boo!

     --------
     SYNOPSIS:

     FidoNews is the newsletter of the FidoNet computer network, its
     Sysops and users.  It is passed to its readers electronically via
     the FidoNet and other computer networks and to non-network
     readers as well.

     This document intends to tell you how to write and submit
     articles for publication in FidoNews. Much of it describes the
     technical specifications which an article must meet in order to
     be included in the newsletter, as well as broad (very) guidelines
     on content. (Of course you realize articles can be submitted only
     electronically.) Please read it carefully. The article you save
     might be your own.


     ------------
     INTRODUCTION:

     FidoNews was originally founded in early 1984 to include all
     parts of the lives of its member Sysops and users, which of
     course means not just technical matters. We do not have fixed
     goals of maximum distribution or maximum readership (i.e. lowest
     common denominator) but only to meet the needs of our individual
     network members. The success of this venture has always been
     contentious at best (ahem).

     In any case the grand experiment continues. Twelve years later
     (at this writing) and over 30,000 Nodes in the network, the
     editorial policy, or lack of one, of FidoNews has shown to
     best fit our ever-changing and unpredictable needs.

     --------------
     SUBJECT MATTER:

     Articles on any subject of interest to FidoNet members and users
     are welcome and encouraged, not necessarily of a technical
     nature, though priority may be, but not necessarily, given to
     articles of importance to the FidoNet, its technology and its
     uses; other networks such as uucp and the Internet; social
     aspects of communications; ethical issues; other related matters.


     --------------
     ARTICLE LENGTH:

     Try to keep articles short. The longer it is, the less likely
     people are to read it. Consider splitting long articles (more
     than five pages) into smaller articles to be run serially.
     Exceptions will be made at the whim of the editors.

     For practical reasons, we will attempt to keep FidoNews to a
     "reasonable size", which is of course a highly subjective and
     variable thing. As of May 1991, the goal is under 100,000 bytes.
     Decisions regarding content may be made based upon this, though
     in general it shouldn't be an issue.


     ------------------
     WRITING GUIDELINES:

     We are not all professional writers, nor is that even a goal for
     the FidoNews -- we want real communication to and from real
     people; even at the expense of so-called "good writing", which is
     frequently a tool to exclude. There are a few minimum
     requirements though for any successful writing, even for the
     lowly FidoNews:

     * The subject discussed must be clear to people other than the
       author! Don't assume that people will pick up the context from
       your writing. Tell them explicitly.

     * Why are you writing this? It may seem obvious -- "Review of the
       new Acme 75-baud Modem" -- but it's not. Are you the
       manufacturer? An irate customer? Let us know your point of
       view.

     * Who are you? A good question! Anonymity is acceptable, though
       most people want to take credit for their work. Include full
       contact information including electronic mail addresses.

     * Articles submitted via Netmail or email must contain all the
       technically required lines and delimiters in the BODY of the
       message.  This includes the *[title] line and the 70 character
       width requirement. | To indicate the filename type for one of
       these message submissions, place the FILENAME.TYP in the Subj:
       line of your email, Netmail, or Echomail |. Those that require
       extra editing may be delayed from appearing in FidoNews.
     FIDONEWS 13-44               Page 4                   28 Oct 1996


     * Articles will appear when space becomes available, not
       necessarily the "next" issue. If your article is of a time-
       critical nature, please say so when you submit it; the editor
       still has final say.

     * The editor reserves the right to request changes from an author
       to meet these "standards", which you have to admit are pretty
       loose. It is not the intent for this to be a mechanism to
       refuse articles the editor does not like, but simply to keep
       the contents intelligible.

     * If we have a backlog of articles, we may get fussier about
       things. Historically, this has not been a serious problem.


     ---------------------
     SUBMITTING AN ARTICLE

     TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

     If all that hasn't scared you away, the next step is to create a
     text file which contains the text of your article. The resulting
     file should be sent or uploaded to | "Editor" |, FidoNet
     address 1:1/23. The "physical" location (and phone number) of
     FidoNews varies, and hence must be found elsewhere, such as
     within a recent copy of FidoNews itself.


     Filenames must follow the MSDOS standard:

         FILENAME.TYP

         a 1 to 8 character file name (A - Z, 0 - 9)
         a period,
         a 0 to 3 character file type (A - Z, 0 - 9)


     File types are used to distinguish types of submissions, as
     follows:

         .ART An article, commentary, open letter, or general news
              item.
         .GUE Want to write a Guest Editorial? [*Name & Node on line 1]
         .RET Need to make a Retraction of a previous article or notice?
         .COL Want to become a regular contributor with your own column?
     |   .ANS Answers to the Question of the Week. |
         .BIO FidoNet biographies - tell us your story.
         .HIS FidoNet history - got an anecdote to share?
         .REV Reviews of related product, services, or programs.
         .JOK Net humor in print.
         .CMX Comics in ASCII. [watch those lines at 70 columns!]
         .PRF Want to Proofread? Get a cookie for spotting errors.
         .AD  Advertising FREE services or events.
         .SAL "For Sale"
         .WAN "Wanted"
         .NOT A notice for the back of the issue. Keep them short.
     FIDONEWS 13-44               Page 5                   28 Oct 1996


     If your file doesn't have one of the above extensions, then it
     will lay around taking up disk space until someone takes a look
     at it and realizes what it is. Maybe.

     The name of the file is up to you, though you should use a name
     which is not likely to be "stepped on" by someone else -- the
     system will not guarantee file names are unique. For example,
     FNEWS.ART is probably not a good name for an article.


     --------------
     CHARACTER SETS:

     The character by character contents of the file itself must meet
     the following standards or it cannot be published in FidoNews.
     The FidoNews staff WILL NOT be responsible for making file
     contents conform to these standards.

     * FLUSH LEFT MARGIN: Please do not put a "left margin" on your
       articles. Have the text start at the very first column.

     * RIGHT MARGIN AT COLUMN 70 OR LESS: Less is tolerable, more is
       definitely not.  If your cursor is resting at column 71 when
       your line is ended, you're okay.  One character past that even
       with trailing spaces and MAKENEWS will barf on your submission.
       If your submission is physically rejected, the Editor will have
       to fix it manually or send it back for reformatting.

     * RAGGED-RIGHT TEXT: Word-Star style "justification" (inserting
       spaces into sentences so that a paragraph is perfectly rec-
       tangular) is extremely hard to read, and consumes needless space.
       Please don't use it!

     * NO FUNNY CHARACTERS: This includes formfeeds, returns without
       linefeeds, linefeeds without returns, tabs and other oddities.
       The only control codes (character codes 0 through 31 decimal)
       allowed are carriage return (CR) and linefeed (LF). The only
       exception is: Control-Z "end of file" terminator characters are
       tolerated. Not required.

     * NO GRAPHICS CHARACTERS: Believe it or not, not everyone in the
       world has an IBM PC. Please restrict yourself to printable
       ASCII characters in the range 20 hex to 7E hex (space to
       tilde).

     * LINES TERMINATED: Each line in the article should be terminated
       with a 'newline' -- either the MSDOS standard (CR/LF) or the
       unix standard (LF only).


     -----------------
     SUBMISSION FORMAT:

     Below is a sample article properly formatted. Features of it are
     discussed further below.

     --article file example begins below this line--
     *A Sample Article [this is in LINE 1 starting at COLUMN 1]

     This is My Title
     by Joe Schmoe, [Netmail/email address]

     And here is my article. Note that it is flush left (zero indent).
     Also note that the right margin is at column seventy so that it
     won't overflow "most" text windows. Each line has a newline. Note
     the *'ed first line. My article will be listed in the table of
     contents exactly as it appears after the * above.

     Figure 1.                       Table 1.
             +-------+               ========
             | A Box |                  Alpha
             +-------+                 Bravo

     Note that we am not using any funny-o characters. This ensures
     that the final article will look the same to every user, no
     matter what sort of hardware he has.

     This is the last sentence of our article.

     --article file example ends above this line--


     The FIRST line of text is the Table of Contents line. It MUST
     begin with an asterisk * as shown above.  NO BLANK lines above
     title line are permitted. If you do not follow this instruction
     exactly, the article will not be listed in the Table of Contents.
     This Table of Contents listing method works for all submission
     file types.

     * Everything that follows the *'ed line will appear in the body
       of the newsletter.  The *'ed line will be stripped out of your
       article text so if you want it repeated as your title in the
       article BE SURE to repeat it on a second line without the *.

     * Next should be the title or name of your article, your name,
       and contact information (network address(es), Postal Service
       address, etc) Try to keep it to one or two lines each.

     * Put a blank line between paragraphs. Paragraphs that all run
       together are very difficult to read, and may be rejected.

     * If you want to put in a table or a figure, go right ahead.
       We do not rearrange text, so your table or figure will
       remain exactly as you entered it. Try to limit them to ones
       that make the communication CLEARER.

     * Don't put a lot of blank space at the top or bottom. The
       FidoNews-generator programs will visually separate articles
       automatically.

     * Please check for basic errors in spelling, grammar, and
       punctuation. We're not publishing a textbook, but you don't
     FIDONEWS 13-44               Page 7                   28 Oct 1996


       want it to embarrass yourself do you?

     * Don't use FidoNews to grind your personal axes against other
       FidoNet members. An article presenting a side of an internal
       dispute is one thing. An article defaming or perseverating over
       several Issues is another. Articles that merely quote endlessly
       from other sources to no particular effect are also not a good
       idea.

     * Don't republish copyrighted material from other sources WITHOUT
       the permission of those sources. Include the permission in such
       articles.

     * Remember that FidoNews is no better or worse than the articles
       submitted to it. If you want FidoNews to be a useful newsletter,
       get involved and submit useful articles. It's up to YOU to make
       it work.

     --------------------
     SUBMISSION DEADLINES:

     FidoNews is published on Monday of every week.  Deadline for file
     submissions to the FidoNews Editor via file-attach is 2300 ET
     [0300 UTC/GMT] the previous Saturday.  Deadline for submissions via
     Netmail, email, or in the FIDONEWS Echo is 2300 ET [0300 UTC/GMT]
     the previous Friday.  Submissions which miss the deadlines will be
     processed the following week.  Submission by deadline is not a
     guarantee of appearance in that week's FidoNews but it is likely
     depending on volume of submissions.

     A Short *.MSG Programming Tutorial [II]
     Damian Walker, 2:2502/666

     This is article 2 of 3 on programming for *.MSG messages.  We start
     with alterations to the generic message reading routine included in
     last week's article.  A full listing of our example program will
     appear in article 3.

     A More Robust Routine to Read Messages

     Let's revisit our readmsg() function which is the workhorse of this
     program.
         The first thing a seasoned C programmer might notice is that there
     is no validation to see if the message file has been opened properly,
     or that it exists at all. In our latest example program (the complete
     file lister) it isn't so important since the existence of the file is
     verified by the findfirst()/findnext() functions.  However, if
     readmsg() is used in other circumstances, this failing might make the
     function unacceptable.  A simple 'if' check solves this problem:

         int readmsg(struct fts1 *msg, char *text, int limit,
             char *filename)
         {
             FILE *msgfile;  /* message file handle info */
             int successful = 0;

             msgfile = fopen(filename, "rb");
             if(msgfile != NULL)
             {
                 fread(msg, sizeof(struct fts1), 1, msgfile);
                 fread(text, 1, limit, msgfile);
                 fclose(msgfile);
                 successful = 1;
             }

             return successful;
         }

     I could have combined the open and the validation 'if':

             if( (msgfile = fopen( filename, "rb" )) != NULL )

     but I'm avoiding C-specific shortcuts like this in the interests of
     readability.
         Notice that I've introduced a return value into the function now,
     so that the calling process can check to see if a message has actually
     been read.  This necessitates the 'successful' variable.
     Alternatively, the value of the pointer 'msgfile' could have been
     returned to the calling process, a NULL meaning that the read was
     unsuccessful, but this is slightly messy as we're possibly giving the
     calling process a pointer to an address which it shouldn't have.
         The next problem with the function is that it relies upon the
     zone and point information in the message header in order to find see
     the full 4D address, and few programs actually use the zone/point
     fields in the header.  This is why our examples up until now have
     limited their output of addresses to the 2D net/node format.
         In order to avoid random data appearing as zone and point numbers
     we must ignore these fields in the header entirely, and instead use
     three kludges which FTS-1 tells us about: INTL, FMPT and TOPT.  These
     are all found within the message text, and are known as 'kludges'
     since they were added to the original specification to cover for
     fields not present in the header of the original message format
     design. The format of INTL is:

         ^AINTL: destzone:destnet/destnode origzone:orignet/orignode

     Although a few programs put an INTL in every message, it should really
     only appear in messages which cross zones, eg. a message from zone 1
     to zone 3.  So this kludge can't be used for in-zone messages, and
     unfortunately there isn't any reliable way of extracting the zone from
     in-zone messages at all.
         Although this sounds like a big drawback, there is an easy way to
     avoid problems.  Most FTN-specific programs will store the address of
     the system which is using the software, and an in-zone message
     arriving at your system has obviously originated from your own zone,
     the zone for the origin and destination systems can be taken from your
     FIDONEWS 13-44               Page 9                   28 Oct 1996


     own address.
         Since a full config file is beyond the scope of this article, I
     shall 'cheat' and use a simple #define to store your own zone number.
     This will be a 2 in these examples (from my own address), but you'll
     want to use your own zone number if you try these examples out-- or
     engineer a better solution altogether, such as a config file or
     command line argument.
         So know we know we have some idea about how to extract the zone
     numbers from a message, let's implement this in code.  The way I do
     this is to stick the origin and destination zones into the header
     fields reserved for that purpose-- just as if they were there in the
     message header in the first place.  The new readmsg() function should
     have the following added after 'int successful = 0;':

             char *kludgefind;

     and the following added after 'successful = 1;':

                 kludgefind = strstr(text, "\01INTL");
                 if(kludgefind == NULL)
                 {
                     msg->origzone = MYZONE;
                     msg->destzone = MYZONE;
                 }
                 else
                 {
                     kludgefind = strchr(kludgefind, ' ');
                     msg->destzone = atoi(kludgefind);
                     kludgefind = strchr(&kludgefind[1], ' ');
                     msg->origzone = atoi(kludgefind);
                 }

     This assumes that MYZONE has been #defined elsewhere, such as in the
     example:

         #define MYZONE 2

     And since it uses atoi(), strchr() and strstr() it also relies upon
     the header files <stdlib.h> and <string.h>, which must now be included
     at the top of the program as follows:

         #include <string.h>
         #include <stdlib.h>

     Basically the code works like this:  If no INTL kludge is present, the
     user's zone (MYZONE) is used in the origin and destination addresses.
     If the INTL kludge is present, it will contain two spaces.  After the
     first space will appear the destination zone followed by a colon
     (':'), and after the second space the origin zone will appear, also
     followed by a colon.  The atoi() function is used to convert the
     textual zone numbers into integers, with the colon serving as a
     terminator which tells the atoi() function where the number ends.
         So now we have a more robust message reading facility which will
     not crash or choke if the file doesn't exist, and it will correctly
     recognise origin and destination zones from kludges in the message
     text.  But what of points?  The process is similar to recognition of
     FIDONEWS 13-44               Page 10                  28 Oct 1996


     nodes, but is slightly easier since once the kludge is found, we know
     that the point number is always six characters on.  We don't need to
     search for the intervening space.  Technically this solution could
     have been used to extract the destination zone from the INTL kludge as
     well.  The following code follows on from the closing brace ('{') of
     the preceding example:

                 kludgefind = strstr(text, "\01FMPT");
                 if(kludgefind == NULL)
                     msg->origpoint = 0;
                 else
                     msg->origpoint = atoi( &kludgefind[6] );
                 kludgefind = strstr(text, "\01TOPT");
                 if(kludgefind == NULL)
                     msg->destpoint = 0;
                 else
                     msg->destpoint = atoi( &kludgefind[6] );

     This section searches for a FMPT kludge, and if found, it takes the
     following number as the originating point.  If it's absent, then the
     originating point number is set to zero, regardless of the existing
     value of the point field in the header.  Remember, the header
     information is unreliable.  Then a similar process follows for
     determining the destination point number.
         Now all we have left to consider in making readmsg() more robust
     is the issue of messages lacking a terminating null() character.
     Since the message text is read as is, and C requires a terminating
     null character on all strings, we need to make sure that the
     terminating null is actually present ourselves.  The simplest way to
     do this is to add the null regardless of whether it was present or
     not.  Converting this idea to C code we add the variable definition:

             int textlen;

     to the top of the readmsg() function and replace the second 'fread'
     line (the one which reads the message text) with the following section
     of code:

                 textlen = fread(text, 1, limit, msgfile);
                 if(textlen < limit)
                     text[textlen] = '\0';
                 else
                     text[limit - 1] = '\0';

     fread() returns the number of items read, and you can see that the
     fread() statement here chooses to define items as single characters,
     so fread() here is returning the number of characters in the message
     body into 'textlen'.
         If the number of characters read is less than the maximum number
     of characters allows (i.e. the size of our buffer) then it's safe to
     add a terminating null onto the end, hence "text[textlen] = '\0';".
     If we've completely filled our buffer, then we need to overwrite the
     last character with a terminating null instead-- "text[limit - 1] =
     '\0';".
         With all these changes in effect, the readmsg() function is in its
     final, reasonably robust, form.  It copes with zone and point numbers,
     FIDONEWS 13-44               Page 11                  28 Oct 1996


     so we could perhaps include these in the display.  The following line
     could be substituted for the existing printf() line in main():

                 printf("%-12s From: %s (%d:%d/%d.%d)\n", f.ff_name,
                     msg.fromusername, msg.origzone, msg.orignet,
                     msg.orignode, msg.origpoint);

     So we can now return to an earlier issue.  What of compilers which do
     not have an equivalent to findfirst() and findnext()?
         More advanced programmers on the PC will realise that these
     functions map directly to a pair of DOS interrupts which may be used,
     and systems other than the PC may have equivalent services in their
     operating system.  But such low-level fiddling is beyond the scope of
     this tutorial.
         There is a simpler, cumbersome brute-force method of obtaining a
     list of messages in a directory, which we can use now that readmsg()
     can cope with missing message files.  The concept is very elementary.
     Simply count from 1 to some arbitrary value, attempting to open every
     message.  The modified readmsg() will return 0 if the message is not
     present, or 1 if it is.  Hence you could use the following code to
     call readmsg() in this way:

             for(count = 1; count <= 2000; ++count)
             {
                 sprintf(msgname, "\\apps\\fd\\mail\\%d.msg", count);
                 successful = readmsg(&msg, text, MAXMSGSIZE, msgname);
                 if(successful)
                     printf("%8d.MSG From: %s (%d:%d/%d.%d)\n", count,
                         msg.fromusername, msg.origzone, msg.orignet,
                         msg.orignode, msg.origpoint);
             }

     The 2000 could be replaced by a #defined constant which suits the
     target system, or a value supplied by a user or in a configuration
     file.  But obviously this method is vastly inferior to the proper
     directory search using findfirst() in both efficiency and
     reliability-- the maximum message number may not be high enough to
     ensure all messages are read.

     Displaying the Body of Messages

     For many purposes it is enough to display the message header, but
     there are other cases where processing or display of the message body
     is needed.  To illustrate this a separate example program is required.
     This program displays part of the header, and all of the body, of a
     *.MSG file.  At its simplest level, the program could be as follows:

         #include <stdio.h>
         #include "fidomsg.h"

         #define MAXMSGSIZE 2048

         /* include the readmsg() function here */

         void main(int argc, char *argv[])
         {
     FIDONEWS 13-44               Page 12                  28 Oct 1996


             struct fts1 msg;
             char text[MAXMSGSIZE];

             readmsg(&msg, text, MAXMSGSIZE, argv[1]);
             printf("From: %s (%d:%d/%d.%d)\n%s\n", msg.fromusername,
                 msg.origzone, msg.orignet, msg.orignode, msg.origpoint,
                 text);
         }

     This simply displays the message text as read, preceded by the 'from'
     line of the header.  This is rarely acceptable, though, since the
     screen code for a new line may not be the simple carriage return
     usually stored by Fidonet software.  Some intellingent processing is
     necessary; the simple printf() line could be replaced by the following
     section of code:

             printf("From: %s (%d:%d/%d.%d)\n", msg.fromusername,
                 msg.origzone, msg.orignet, msg.orignode, msg.origpoint);
             lastchar = '\0';
             for(count = 0; count < strlen(text); ++count)
             {
                 switch( text[count] )
                 {
                     case '\n':
                         if(lastchar != '\r') printf("\n");
                         break;
                     case '\r':
                         printf("\n");
                         break;
                     default:
                         putc( text[count] );
                 }
                 lastchar = text[count];
             }

     where lastchar must be declared along with the other variables in
     main(), as a 'char', and count must be declared as an int.
         A little explanation is in order: Most characters are displayed as
     is.  A carriage return ('\r', or ASCII 13) is converted to a linefeed;
     printf() will display this correctly on the target computer system no
     matter what the actual code sequence for a linefeed should be.  An
     actual ASCII linefeed character ('\n' or ASCII 10) is displayed as it
     is, only if it is not preceded by a carriage return.
         This simple algorithm copes correctly with three eventualities: a
     message stored with carriage returns, with linefeeds, or with carriage
     return and linefeed pairs.  To make the display more aesthetically
     pleasing, you would also want to implement some form of word-wrap
     routine since Fidonet messages usually only put line terminators on
     the end of each paragraph.
         At the simplest level, you could implement this with a simple
     character counter and a 'if' statement which inserts a new line when
     the character count exceeds some line length.  Better word wrap
     routines will read ahead of the display, and wrap a line at the last
     whitespace character before the right margin is reached.  Since this
     is departing from Fidonet-specific concerns, I'll leave you to figure
     out how this could be done, while I go on to cover the writing of
     FIDONEWS 13-44               Page 13                  28 Oct 1996


     *.MSG files.

     Other Header Fields

     So far I have neglected to mention two important header fields which
     are of no relevance to our chief example program, but which are still
     important enough that they have a place in this tutorial.
         The first of these fields is the date field.  This is a
     20-character null-terminated string, which is in a specific format.
     If all you want to do with the date is display it, then you will find
     it in an acceptable format already.  For processing of the date you
     will have a little more work to do.  I won't go into a full
     explanation on date parsing, as that subject would fill an article in
     itself, but I will briefly explain the date format used so that you
     have enough information to easily work out a way to extract the date
     information for processing.  The format is most concisely described as
     follows:

         DD Mmm YY  HH:MM:SS

     Followed by a terminating NULL character.  DD is the day of the month,
     from 01-31.  Mmm is a 3-letter month name abbreviation in English, one
     of the following:

         Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec

     YY is the year (I wonder how Fidonet software will cope in the year
     2000?)  Finally, the HH:MM:SS is the time-- hours, minutes and
     seconds.
         That's all you need to know about building/interpreting a
     timestamp, but what about that other header field I mentioned?  I'm
     referring to the attribute word.  This contains certain flags which
     tell the mailer or mail processor how the message will behave
     route-wise, and other yes/no information about the message.  A full
     list of attribute bits is available in FTS-1, but it's repeated here
     in the form of a series of #defined constants which should be included
     in the file 'fidomsg.h' for use by netmail programs:

         #define MSGPVT      0x0001    /* Private */
         #define MSGCRASH    0x0002    /* Crash message */
         #define MSGRECD     0x0004    /* Message received */
         #define MSGSENT     0x0008    /* Message sent */
         #define MSGFILE     0x0010    /* File attached */
         #define MSGTRANSIT  0x0020    /* In transit */
         #define MSGORPHAN   0x0040    /* Orphan */
         #define MSGKILL     0x0080    /* Kill/sent */
         #define MSGLOCAL    0x0100    /* Local */
         #define MSGHOLD     0x0200    /* Hold for pickup */
         #define MSGFREQ     0x0800    /* File request */
         #define MSGRRR      0x1000    /* Return receipt request */
         #define MSGIRR      0x2000    /* Is return receipt */
         #define MSGAUDIT    0x4000    /* Audit request */
         #define MSGUPDATE   0x8000    /* File update request */

         What I also need to tell you about are two attributes which you
     might think belong in the attribute word but which are actually found
     FIDONEWS 13-44               Page 14                  28 Oct 1996


     in kludges, presumably because they were added after the 16 bits of
     the attribute word were all allocated.
         'Direct' is the first of these, and it is often used so perhaps
     it's reasonably important to know about.  The other is 'Del/Sent'.
     This isn't just another name for 'Kill', but refers to files in a file
     attach message; a file attach message with 'Del/Sent' should delete
     the file when it has been sent.  These attributes both use the FLAGS
     kludge, as follows:

         ^AFLAGS DIR

     for direct, or

         ^AFLAGS KFS

     for 'Del/Sent', I make the assumption that these initials stand for
     'Kill File Sent', but whether this is correct or not, the technical
     meaning of the attribute is more important to us than the expansion of
     its acronym.
         These attributes may be combined in a single FLAGS kludge, and
     bear in mind that there may be other attributes which make use of the
     FLAGS kludge as well.
         Next week's article deals moves on to writing *.MSG messages, and
     includes some examples unrelated to our message lister.  It also
     includes the full source code for the message lister.

     WHAT IS THIS ECHO CALLED FILK?
     Kay Shapero 1:102/524 (kay.shapero@salata.com)

     A recent article identified some, but by no means all of the music-
     related echoes to be found in FIDOnet.   Here's some information on
     one not mentioned, which can be found on the Zone 1 backbone as FILK.
     The following is reprinted from the (much larger) Filk Frequently
     Asked Questions file, which I maintain and can be f'reqed from
     1:102/524 as FILKFAQ.ZIP.  The article by Nick Smith is used with
     permission.

     What is this stuff called filk?  My own favorite definition is simply
     "the folk music of the science fiction/fantasy fan community."
     For a more detailed description, see below:

     WHAT THE HECK IS FILK MUSIC?

     by Nick Smith (of LA Filkharmonics)

     Well, it's sort of like folk music.  It is a mixture of song parodies
     and original music, humorous and serious, about subjects like science
     fiction, fantasy, computers, cats, politics, the space program, books,
     movies, TV shows, love, war, death. . .

     Filk music started off forty or fifty years ago, at science fiction
     conventions, where people got together late at night to have good
     old-fashioned folk music song circles.  Well, late night circles being

     what they are, some folks got a little silly and started singing song
     parodies about their favorite SF books and authors.  Fans started
     writing song parodies about themselves or each other.  Some started
     composing serious songs about favorite topics.  Some authors started
     composing original songs for their books.  If the author didn't list a
     tune, fans made up one.  Sometimes two.  Sometimes several.

     Eventually, Filk songs wre written for just about every major science
     fiction or fantasy work.  Some of them were actually good enough that
     people wanted to learn them, or just listen to them more than just at
     conventions.  At that point, song books and recordings started being
     made.
      Over the last decade, Filk Music has reached the point where there
     are entire Filk Music gatherings, conventions, recording companies,
     and publications.  Filk Music includes song parodies, original songs,
     and slightly musical poetry.  It's a fun way to indulge in a little
     musical creativity, especially if you are a science fiction or fantasy
     fan as well as musically inclined.  If you are only a fan, but not
     musical, you can still listen.  Filk circles aren't pushy about
     requiring you to play or sing.  If you are only musical, but not a
     fan, no one will hold it against you.  Remember, we're in this thing
     for fun!

     What Nick didn't tell you is that the name started out as a typo of
     "folk" and was gleefully adopted by all and sundry as a term for what
     is after all a somewhat unusual subset.

     Subject: Rules, rules, rules...
     From: surak@juno.com (Rob A Shinn)

     For immediate release to FidoNews:

     There has been a lot of political in-fighting on FidoNet regarding
     rules in the past few months, and in fact for at least 5 years now.
     Many people, particularly Internet people, refer to us a Fight-O-Net.
     If we are *EVER* to exist side-by-side with the Internet in the online
     future, we are going to have to change our errant ways.

     First of all, people, we have to remember our roots!  FidoNet was
     founded in the ideals of FREE SPEECH.  It is a very libertarian-style
     network.  Thus, rules have been very minimal on FidoNet.  The reasons
     for this are clear:  rules are not conducive to the free exchange of
     ideas.  Just because you don't agree with someone's ideas, or you
     don't like a participant, or you don't like the moderator of a
     particular echo: CHANGE THE CHANNEL!  You don't have to read anything
     FIDONEWS 13-44               Page 16                  28 Oct 1996


     on FidoNet.  You don't have to receive any "file-bone" echos, either.
     If you disagree with the way Craig Ford runs the COMM echo, or with
     the banishment of James Dixon from Trek, you don't have to read EITHER
     echo.  In fact, the Moderators would probably rather that you would
     not.  If you don't agree with the political ideas on the Rush Limbaugh
     echo, or you have moral reservations about the Gay/Lesbian echo, no
     one is twisting your arm.  Don't read them, don't carry them.

     If, OTOH, you think that all this stuff needs to regulated by some
     central controlling body...Heck, quit FidoNet, and join Intelec or
     U'NI-net (better not spell their name wrong or the Net Police will get
     you...<snicker>).  These socialist networks are run by petty
     dictators (John Young and Cam Debuck, respectively) that have decided
     that if they control the content and behavior of users, they can
     somehow have a higher "quality" network.

     Don't believe me?  Get their policy/list files, IN_####.ZIP (the
     latest as of this writing was IN_9610.ZIP) for Intelec and UNI###.ZIP
     (latest being UNI324.ZIP) for U'NI-net. Try and post a message on
     Intelec containing the word 'ABORTION' and watch how fast you are
     "TCAN'ed".  These networks actually have TCAN (trash can) files that
     ban users from the ENTIRE NETWORK upon breaking the rules in any
     conference...the discretion sitting with the "benign" Network
     Administrator or Network Host (either read: Net Dictator).  The
     Dictato...errrr...Network Administrator of Intelec, John Young, is so
     anal retentive, that he has a 300-and-some-line text file for the
     network rules, NETRULES.IN, in which each rule has been painstakingly
     fit onto one line, of 70 characters each, abbreviating or padding with
     spaces if necessary to make it fit.  And both dictators are so AR,
     that even spelling the name of the network wrong, including improper
     capitalization or punctuation, is grounds for immediate banishment
     from the network.  Do you want someone like that telling you what you
     can and cannot post?  Do you want to exist in a online Gestapo state?
     If so, be my guest, go ahead and join the socialists, the dictators,
     and the Nazis...

     I, OTOH, will stick with FidoNet, as long as we can keep things simple
     in regards to rules. FidoNet has existed in its present form since
     1984!  The current lack of Zone 1 Echo Policy is not in the least
     detrimental to FidoNet.  Individual moderators have done a decent job
     of running their own echoes.  Some, like Gary Gilmore have long lists
     of very specific rules.  Others, like Bob Kohl and Craig Ford have a
     list of general guidelines (Craig's is *very* loose, having adopted
     Steve Shapiro's 'Echomail Guidelines').  I favor looser guidelines,
     but if you like strict rules, you can always vote with your feet.

     Usenet is probably too loose.  Most newsgroups are unmoderated and
     spam and junk kill many newsgroups.  But Intelec and U'NI-net (again,
     making sure they're spelled right...) are nothing but extremism.  We
     need to have moderated discussions, but control by a dictator in the
     name of "expediency" (an argument that has been used by Fidel Castro
     and Adolph Hitler to name a couple) has no place in FidoNet.  But
     that's the way we're headed if we keep up this fighting up.

     So lets get back to our roots...and stand united and proud of a
     FidoNet that is what it always has been - a place for the free

                              FIDONET HISTORY
     =================================================================


     [Part of a continuing series on the history of FidoNet and the folks
      and programs that made it happen] Ed.

     Date: 05 Feb 87  11:55:57
     From: Phil Becker on 128/16, FireNet Leader, Colorado Springs CO
     To:   All on 135/14, Metro-Fire Fido of SFLorida Net, Miami FL
     Subj: TBBS ECHOMAIL

     I am leaving this message here in order to inform FIDO and OPUS SYSOPs
     that the TBBS Net Mail option will be released in about 2 weeks.
     After that time there will likely be a large number of new (to
     FIDONET) TBBS SYSOPS joining various EchoMail conferences.  TBBS
     EchoMail handling is enhanced somewhat over the basic FidoNet EchoMail
     for use in TBBS only networks.  However, I have included a command
     line option on the ECHOSCAN processor called -v1 which makes its
     output 100% compatible with the existing SCAN/TOSS.  Now to the reason
     for this message.  This option is not the default.  New users who fail
     to set this option, and join a conference with those of you using FIDO
     and OPUS, will generate messages that get "chopped up" at the 80
     column point by TOSS/SCAN.  If you see this sort of thing happening,
     inform the TBBS SYSOP who is generating such messages to set the -v1
     option on his ECHOSCAN command to generate compatible messages.
     Unfortunately with the large number of users new to the net, I am sure
     this will happen frequently and I want you, who will suffer from it,
     to know how to quickly inform the TBBS SYSOP of his error in his own
     terms to minimize this problem.  It has already happened during beta
     test a few times, and even with a sizeable caution in the manual I am
     sure it will happen again, and hope this note will keep the confusion
     down.

     Also, in an attempt to anticipate the growth of EchoMail in this net,
     and the directions it may take, the TBBS EchoMail handlers will
     operate correctly if the AREA: and SEEN-BY lines are prefixed with ^A
     to suppress their display.  If the net converts to this format at
     large, there is an option on the TBBS EchoScan called -hide which can
     be set to generate this type of output to the net.  I hope that this
     information will allow those of you who are not running and don't want
     to have to learn about TBBS, but will have to live with its output to
     do so much more easily.  Since there is now a proliferation of
     software on the net, tracking down such problems can become quite time
     consuming and I hope this will remove some of the false problems (due
     to operator error) more easily by helping you to recognize them and
     know what to tell the offending SYSOP to do to fix them.

     The other hackers warned him not to play with magic spells.
     They said "These things could send you to a dozen diff'rent hells."
     He didn't hear, he didn't care, his mind was in a spin
     At the worlds that now existed and the worlds that might have been.

     He started searching like a madman, green fire shining in his eyes.
     He vowed he'd plunder all the worlds for high tech gear and spells.
     But he found a Disney dreamworld; and something that he met
     Derezzed his body right into the Net...

     No more pointed green eartips, no socket in the head,
     And no black leather jacket with "Deck 'em" on the back.
     The mirror shades are broken that flashed like the midday sun
     But he still is the terror of every shadowrun!

     FTSC Jokes
     by Lee Kindness, 2:259/7, lkindnes@csl.co.uk

     Just a wee ditty that flowed thru NET_DEV last week, and it relates
     quite well to last weeks editorial...

     *** From: Paul Edwards (3:711/934.9)
     *** To  : All
     *** Subj: FTSC Jokes!

     Hey guys, have you heard the latest list of FTSC jokes?  If anyone
     has seen any other joke lists floating around the echos, please post
     them!

     Q. How many FTSC members does it take to screw in a lightbulb?

     A. The FTSC only documents existing practice.  There is no
     mathematical proof that lightbulbs are existing practice.


     Q. How many FTSC members does it take to write an FTSC document?

     A. The FTSC doesn't write documents, it just publishes them.


     Q. How do I get the FTSC to publish my document?

     A. That is not documented.


     Q. How do I get the FTSC to approve my proposal and make it a
        standard?

     A. The FTSC doesn't approve proposals, that's the job of a standards
        committee.


     Q. Who do I report errors in the published standards to?

     A. Do you have internet access?
        NO) - sorry, the FTSC Chair only responds to internet mail.
        YES) - what do you want to use fidonet for, if you have internet?
        Everyone else in the FTSC only uses internet, including the only
        person who has the legal authority to update FTS-1.  We are still
        attempting to track the author of FTS-4, to see if we can get him
        to join the internet too.


     Q. What do you get if you mix all the output of the FTSC, with a
        dead fish?

     A. A dead fish.


     Q. Within the FTSC circles, what is the FTSC Chair known as?

     A. We've got a Chairman, have we?


     Q. What did the FTSC committee member say to the non-FTSC-committee
        member?

     FIDONEWS 13-44               Page 22                  28 Oct 1996


     A. Nothing.  The FTSC does not talk to developers, they only get in
        the way.


     Q. Which has more intelligence - the FTSC Chair, the rest of the FTSC,
        or a door knob?

     A. Only an FTSC member would need to ask such a question.  Don't
        bother asking the chairman for the answer - try asking Mr Knob.


     Q. Why is the FTSC echo not publicly-readable (even if not writeable)?

     A. Because then the developers would know that they were dead.  At
        the moment developers have this quaint picture of lots of
        committee members scurrying around trying to do things to help
        the average developer actually WRITE something.


     Q. What does FTSC stand for?

     A. Need Another Seven Astronauts.


     Q. What does FTSC really stand for?

     A. What gave you the impression that the FTSC was capable of standing?


     Q. What is the preferred programming language of the FTSC?

     A. Turtle Graphics.


     Q. If the FTSC were a country, which one would it be?

     A. Mars.  It's out-er-space, which is why there's no room for
        any more standards.


     Q. What do you get if you cross an FTSC member with a pen and a
        coathanger?

     A. Pens that multiply instead of disappearing (clarification for
        FTSC members - it's the coathangers that cause the multiplication,
        not you).


     Q. Why don't FTSC members put ice in their drinks?

     A. The FTSC member who had the recipe, died.


     Q. Why do FTSC members' dogs have flat noses?

     A. From chasing parked cars.
     FIDONEWS 13-44               Page 23                  28 Oct 1996


     Q. Why do FTSC members have flat noses?

     A. From chasing their dogs too closely.


     Q. Does an FTSC member float or sink if immersed in water?

     A. "Dissolved" is a better way to describe the phenomenon.


     Q. Why do FTSC members prefer to use pentiums?

     A. It reports that they have produced a positive number of
        standards in the last 6 years (0.000000353).


     Q. What's the difference between an FTSC member and a snail?

     A. One's slow, doesn't have any intelligence, and if you were
        stuck in traffic behind it, you'd die of old age before
        getting to your destination.  The other is an insect found
        in gardens.

     YOU KNOW YOU ARE ADDICTED TO THE INTERNET WHEN:

       * You kiss your girlfriend's home page.

       * Your bookmark takes 15 minutes to scroll from top to bottom.

       * Your eyeglasses have a web site burned in on them.

       * You find yourself brainstorming for new subjects to search.

       * You refuse to go to a vacation spot with no electricity and no
         phone lines.

       * You finally do take that vacation, but only after buying a
         cellular modem and a laptop.

       * You spend half of the plane trip with your laptop on your
         lap...and your child in the overhead compartment.

       * All your daydreaming is preoccupied with getting a faster
         connection to the net: 28.8...ISDN...cable modem...T1...T3.

       * And even your night dreams are in HTML.

       * You find yourself typing "com" after every period when using a
         word processor.com.

       * You refer to going to the bathroom as downloading.

       * Your heart races faster and beats irregularly each time you see a
         new WWW site address in print or on TV, even though you've never
         had heart problems before.

       * You step out of your room and realize that your parents have moved
         and you don't have a clue when it happened.

       * You turn on your intercom when leaving the room so you can hear if
         new e-mail arrives.

       * Your wife drapes a blond wig over your monitor to remind you of
     FIDONEWS 13-44               Page 27                  28 Oct 1996


         what she looks like.

       * All of your friends have an @ in their names.

       * When looking at a pageful of someone else's links, you notice all
         of them are already highlighted in purple.

       * Your dog has its own home page.

       * You've already visited all the links at Yahoo and you're halfway
         through Lycos. or [C]ontinue?

       * You can't call your mother...she doesn't have a modem.

       * You realize there is not a sound in the house and you have no idea
         where your children are.

       * You check your mail. It says "no new messages." So you check it
         again.

       * You refer to your age as 3.x.

       * You have commandeered your teenager's phone line for the net and
         even his friends know not to call on his line anymore.

       * Your phone bill comes to your doorstep in a box.

       * Even though you died last week, you've managed to retain OPS on
         your favorite IRC channel.

       * You code your homework in HTML and give your instructor the URL.

       * You don't know the sex of three of your closest friends, because
         they have neutral nicknames and you never bothered to ask.

       * Your husband tells you he's had the beard for 2 months.

       * You miss more than five meals a week downloading the latest games
         from Apogee.t, or [C]ontinue?

       * You start looking for hot HTML addresses in public restrooms.

       * You move into a new house and decide to Netscape before you
         landscape.

       * You tell the cab driver you live at
         http://123.elm.street/house/bluetrim.html

       * You actually try that 123.elm.street address.

       * You tell the kids they can't use the computer because "Daddy's got
         work to do" and you don't even have a job.

       * Your friends no longer send you e-mail...they just log on to your
         IRC  channel.

       * You buy a Captain Kirk chair with a built-in keyboard and mouse.

       * Your wife makes a new rule: "The computer cannot come to bed."

       * You are so familiar with the WWW that you find the search engines
         useless.

       * You get a tattoo that says "This body best viewed with Netscape
         1.1 or higher."

       * You never have to deal with busy signals when calling your
         ISP...because you never log off.

       * You ask a plumber how much it would cost to replace the chair in
         front of your computer with a toilet.

       * You forget what year it is.

       * You start tilting your head sideways to smile.

       * You ask your doctor to implant a gig in your brain.

       * You leave the modem speaker on after connecting because you think
         it sounds like the ocean wind...the perfect soundtrack for
         "surfing the net".

       * You begin to wonder how on earth your service provider is allowed
         to call 200 hours per month "unlimited."

       * You turn on your computer and turn off your wife.

       * Your wife says communication is important in a marriage...so you
         buy another computer and install a second phone line so the two of
         you can chat.

       * As your car crashes through the guardrail on a mountain road, your
         first instinct is to search for the "back" button.

     Hope you all have a great Thursday!

     Top 10 Signs You're Addicted to the net

               10. You wake up at 3 a.m. to go to the bathroom and stop and
                   check your e-mail on the way back to bed.

               9.  You get a tattoo that reads "This body best viewed with
                   Netscape Navigator 1.1 or higher."

               8.  You name your children Eudora, Mozilla and Dotcom.

               7.  You turn off your modem and get this awful empty
                   feeling, like you just pulled the plug on a loved one.

               6.  You spend half of the plane trip with your laptop on
                   your lap...and your child in the overhead compartment.

               5.  You decide to stay in college for an additional year or
                   two, just for the free Internet access.

               4.  You laugh at people with 2400-baud modems.

               3.  You start using smileys in your snail mail.

               2.  The last girl you picked up was a JPEG.

               1.  Your hard drive crashes. You haven't logged in for two
                   hours. You start to twitch. You pick up the phone and
                   manually dial your ISP's access number. You try to hum
                   to communicate with the modem. You succeed.

     Subj: Speech and Fido

     Christopher,
     In volume 13, number 43 of FidoNews, you ask:

     "I am aware that there are folks out there reading FidoNews with
      speech programs. I know these programs are also used for Netmail and
      Echomail.

      The Question of the Week is who uses these programs, what programs
      are in use, and are any of these functions available inside mailers
      or BBS or editor programs?"

     First of all, I will intentionally attempt to be as brief as
     possible, mainly because my experience tells me I can quite
     easily discuss this topic to the point of boring my audience and
     stifling further interest!  You see, for some of us, speech
     access to computers has dominated our lifes for years, and
     therefore our passion for the topic prevents us from recognizing
     the bounds of normal conversation!

     Simply put, speech programs are being used by anyone who finds
     their use an aid in accessing the information on their computer
     screen!  This includes people such as myself who are totally
     blind, partially sighted people who often use speech in
     conjunction with a screen enlargement program, and others who are
     in some way print impaired including the dyslexic.  Although I
     don't have specific numbers available to me, there are
     undoubtedly many thousands of individuals using speech synthesis
     to access their computer screens in North America, several times
     this worldwide!

     In most cases, by the way, there are two components to a speech
     system, the software half or speech program you've referred to,
     and the hardware half, the synthesizer itself.  The speech
     program gives the user control over how the text is spoken,
     including very basic things like rate and pitch, as well as very
     subtle characteristics such as pronunciation of specific
     punctuation, color attributes, etc.  Commands available with the
     typical speech program range from keys to totally reread the
     screen or current cursor line to automatic reading of this or
     that enhancement, if and only if it appears in a specific area of
     the screen!  Basically speaking, the better the user knows their
     speech program, the more efficient they can be with their
     computer, and with today's speech programs the potential is
     FIDONEWS 13-44               Page 38                  28 Oct 1996


     profound!

     Speech synthesizers come in both internal and external models and
     are configured as either a serial or parallel device.  Some
     common names of speech programs for DOS are Vocal-Eyes, ASAP,
     Flipper and Jaws, demos available for downloading from BlinkLink,
     1:129/89, as well as many other sources.  Common synthesizers
     include the Dectalk, SmarTalk, DoubleTalk and Soundingboard as
     well as many others.  In general, speech programs range from
     about $300.00 to $550.00 while synthesizers go for between
     $350.00 to $1200.00, the price dependant upon various factors
     such as intelligibility, portability, etc.

     No BBS or mailer program that I know of gives the user specific
     speech functions, or at least none actually produce speech as I
     assume you meant by your question.  As you can tell by what I've
     said above, however, most all text based software can be used
     with a speech program-synthesizer combination, and this includes
     everything from Binkleyterm to the vanilla Opus I'm running here!
     In fact, certain things can be done by the programmer to insure
     that their wares are indeed more speech friendly, thus the reason
     Doug Boone added the "Talker" option to Opus 1.73A.  In general,
     what has become known as the "Speech Friendly Interface" has been
     added to many Dos programs, including both the Silver Xpress and
     Blue Wave off-line readers, the Commo communications program, and
     even the Shez file manager, so if anyone would like to learn more
     about what makes a program more speech compatible, file request
     "SFI.ZIP" from 1:129/89.  Also, you may wish to consider joining
     us in BLINKTALK, the original Fidonet visual disabilities echo
     that's available from the backbone and has been around since
     1988.  We discuss things like this and other topics related to
     blindness everyday, and although most of us are indeed visually
     impaired, ALL are welcome!

     Hopefully that answered your question without boring TOO much, as
     I truly did try and keep it as short as possible!  Thank goodness
     you didn't ask about how Windows and the Graphical User Interface
     is effecting all this or I would just be getting warmed up at
     this point! B-)

     Hello Christopher,

     FIDONEWS 13-44               Page 39                  28 Oct 1996


     I use speech synthesis because of my visual disability.

     There are several commercially available applications as well as a
     wide variety of speech synthesizers.  These software packages are
     often called screen readers. They are resident programs that sit in
     the background causing keystrokes to be spoken as well as any Bios
     output. Most modern screen readers also deal with direct screen
     writes. Pulldown menu items are announced as I highlight them.
     Characters that I cursor over while writing this message are spoken.
     Also, there are provisions to review anything currently on my screen
     at anytime.

     What this means in practicality is since the screen reader handles the
     task of providing output to the synthesizer many applications can be
     successfully used without being adapted for the speech user.

     There are some limitations to this of which I won't go into, but most
     mailers, tossers and a lot of common Bbs packages work well. Some have
     a "speech friendly" mode that causes them to use bios routines for
     screen writes as well as other things that make them work a little
     better with screen review apps. One example that comes to mind is the
     setup for Allfix.

     Most all of the common mailers, Binkleyterm, frontdoor etc have been
     used with speech. I have ran Wildcat and Maximus as Bbs packages but
     others are in use too.

     I discovered Fidonet in 1991 when I heard about an echo for discussion
     of adaptive software as well as many other things of interest to me.

     There are quite a few visually impaired sysops in Fidonet.  I put up
     my board last year when the local net became a local telephone call in
     my small town.

     Greetings Mr. Baker.

     This is in response to your "Question of the Week", regarding the use
     of speech programs within mailers or BBS or editor programs.  I found
     and tried just such an animal about a month ago, but it was an offline
     mail reader.  I hope this is the type of information you had in mind.

     Latest Greatest Software Versions
     by Peter E. Popovich, 1:363/264

     Crap. In the final stages of preparing this week's submission, I
     managed to accidentally trash most of the changes since last week and
     all of my pending entries. I'll do my best to reconstruct the changes,
     but it may take a few weeks to get back up to speed. Phooey.

     I've had problems upstream with my inbound routed netmail. I strongly
     suggest folks -crash- their submissions to me or e-mail them to me at
     popovich@gate.net

     Phased out this week: Archimedes Software

     Phase-out highlights:
       This week: Atari ST/TT Software Deadline for info: 8 Nov 1996.
       Last week: QNX Software Deadline for info: 1 Nov 1996.
