First a reminder from TJ --

I will be out of town until 1 Aug 1991. Tim Pozar is acting as
editor (he's on the masthead, in case you didn't notice). He can
be reached at 1:125/555. Articles etc. still go to 1:1/1.
Probably most of the projects I initiated are on hold until I
return. 'Salright, we lasted this long without them.

Hey! Bye! Have a nice trip! (Wait... that's your line!)

10th ARRL Amateur Radio
Computer Networking Conference
27-29 September 1991
Radisson Airport Hotel
San Jose, CA

The Northern California Packet Association (NCPA) is hosting this
year's ARRL Computer Networking Conference and invites you to
attend.  Glenn Tenney, AA6ER, is the local conference chairperson.

Hams from around the world will be presenting papers on what
they're working on in packet radio.  The presentations  and papers
might cover any subject from satellites to spread spectrum, from
protocols to hardware, or any other topic related to how hams are, or
will be networking

In addition to the usual presentation of papers all day Saturday, this
year's conference will be surrounded by other interesting and
informative activities.  See the agenda inside to see what we have
planned for Friday and Sunday.  You won't want to miss any of this.
Send in the attached registration right now, and contact the ARRL for
an author's packet.

How to Submit Papers

The deadline for receipt of camera-ready papers is 12 August.  If
you're going to submit a paper, you should contact Lori Weinberg at
ARRL, 225 Main Street, Newington, CT 06111, telephone 203-666-
1541, fax at 203-665-7531.  Lori is handling the arrangements for
the proceedings.

How to Register for the Conference

Please use the attached conference pre-registration form to register
for the tutorials, main conference, and the dinners.  We are working
with a VERY tight budget and would appreciate receiving your
registration and check at the earliest possible date.  We have already
had to make quite a commitment to the hotel, and catering is asking
for a commitment which requires a close attendance count.  Make
your checks payable to "Fantasia Systems Inc." and mail them to
AA6ER at: Glenn Tenney, AA6ER; Fantasia Systems Inc.; 2111
Ensenada Way; San Mateo, CA 94403 (the address is also on the
form).

Hotel Reservations

FidoNews 8-28                  Page 4                      15 Jul 1991


We've arranged an attractive room rate of $69 per night, plus tax, for
single or double occupancy.  You'll have to make your hotel
reservations early as the number of rooms blocked out for us is
limited.   Call the Radisson Hotel directly at (800) 333- 3333 to make
your reservation.  You'll need to tell them your reservation is for the
"ARRL CNC" to access our block of rooms.  The way hotels work, it
will help us meet our budget if our block of rooms is used up.

Transportation

The conference hotel is located near to the San Jose International
airport which supports both commercial and general aircraft.  The
Radisson Hotel offers shuttle service to and from the airport.  Be sure
to ask about the shuttle service when you make your hotel
reservation.

In an effort to save you money, we've selected American Airlines as
the official airline for the conference.  What this means is that you
can receive discount air fares (eg. from within the U.S., 5% off the
lowest published applicable fare).  You'll have to contact American
Airlines directly for details.  Call their Meeting Services Desk at (800)
433-1790 and refer to Star #S47Z14A.   Since San Jose is an
American Airlines' hub, you should find it very convenient.

The Agenda

We're still improving and tweaking the agenda, but here's the agenda
as it stands right now:

Friday, 27 September

        13:00 - 17:00:  In-Depth Tutorials

Three concurrent in-depth technical sessions will be available.  These
planned "tutorials" are expected to include:  Digital Signal Processing;
Spread Spectrum and Part 15; and Packet Satellites.  The speakers
selected will be those currently working on the leading edge of these
technologies.  These sessions will allow the subjects to be covered in
depth and right down to the bits and bytes level.  These sessions are
priced separately, and will include handouts and a mid-afternoon
break.

19:00 - 21:30:  Dinner

Instead of everyone trying to find a pizza place that can handle fifty
or a couple of hundred people, we've decided to have a very special
group dinner.  As an option you can sign up for the Friday evening
dinner and join everyone for a LUAU!  Yes, a real honest to goodness
luau!  This should be an ideal time for everyone to relax.  We expect
that most of you will join us, even if you aren't attending the
tutorials.  This will be right at the hotel, so you won't have to drive
anywhere.  After dinner we expect to have some informal BOF
sessions.

FidoNews 8-28                  Page 5                      15 Jul 1991


Saturday, 28 September

        08:30 - 17:00:  Presentation of CNC Papers

This is the traditional part of the conference.  As in past years we'll
be gathering up all of the papers submitted for presentation, and
divide them into the time available.  Everyone will have a chance to
present a paper.  The published proceedings and lunch (at noon) are
included in the conference fee.

        18:30 - 21:00:  Dinner

The CNC doesn't stop at dinner.  We've arranged an optional dinner at
the hotel complete with a guest speaker.  At this time, we don't know
who will be the banquet speaker, but based on some of the names
we're discussing, you won't want to miss this!

        21:00 - 24:00:  BOF sessions

Ten or fifteen minutes per paper really isn't enough, so we've
planned break-out rooms for "Birds Of a Feather" sessions.  During
the day we'll have sign-up sheets so that discussion groups can form
and really get into topics of greatest interest.

Sunday, 29 September:

As usual, the digital committee will have their business meeting
Sunday morning from 09:00 until 12:00.  But that's not all...

We're going to have a demo room available from about 09:00 until
13:00.  We're hoping that you'll be able to bring a rig with you to
show off your latest work.  We may also have some exhibitors.  But
wait, that's still not all...

We're going to present various newcomer tutorials from 10:00 until
13:00.  These tutorials may be for the first-time packet user, while
others might be for the first- time TCP/IP user.  These tutorials will
help folks learn more about various aspects of packet radio.  The
demo/exhibit room and newcomer tutorials will be open to all hams
and prospective hams whether signed up for the rest of the
conference or not.

And finally, the San Jose Technology Center is a short light-rail ride
away and they have a fantastic high-tech museum called The Garage.
Although  a trip to the garage isn't an official part of the CNC, we're
sure a large group will be planning a visit on Sunday.  We'll try to
help plan this outing during the conference.  We'll likely work out a
late morning trip and an early afternoon trip.

GAAAAARGH!  A look at FidoNews, with both eyes shut

Billy Cash III - Programmer's Connection BBS - 1:226/70.0

FidoNews is the battleground of FidoNet.  Everyone screams and
yells and hollers, and when somebody else tries to talk, they
scream louder!  I love this -- but what's especially funny is
the utmost degree of seriousness some people take things to.

 * Of course we have the weirdo Satanists and renegade
   Christians firing shots at each other, calling Christianity a
   cult and Satanism a religion, then vice versa, which is an
   absolute riot.

 * We have the bureaucracy wars, but we pretend to be an
   efficient electronic society, so there aren't any paper forms
   to hurl around.  Maybe they'll start throwing Hector Santos
   and his Express Forms package at each other, instead.

 * Then there are the bodily-organ-people, as in "An NC Vents
   His Spleen."  This is not all that different from what I saw
   in the supermarket tabloids yesterday -- "South America's ZEC
   Eats Own Liver!"

Unfortunately, all these strange loud-mouthed people are turning
me off.  I used to read this for the new echo announcements --
there was one this week, hardly nothing, but there were three
arguements for pagan animal slaughter or whatever, and GMD
enjoyed free publicity.  I wound up writing someone for a copy
of Grunged Mail Detector to play with.

For this reason, I propose a new newsletter.  We'd call it
BabbleNews, and it would consist of that week's FidoNews run
through this meat-grinder-for-text program I have.  Here are a
few excerpts from BabbleNews 8.27.

     Snooze and another 23 days from Tony Davis's much
     vaunted GMD 2.09 specifically allows for want for receiving
     such a number of the higher levels of mine from a night
     because it appeared in my expenses, and since I am aware
     prior to deliver it is. It's Tim's turn -- a member of any
     understanding of articles.  It takes time it was honored.

     Where I will address the various drafts as well as a
     better term "7 the Sending us in recent weeks and would
     have not a member of policeman and 6 Any message I had
     never been provided an intake workers."

     Until FTSC releases an ugly undercurrent has been
FidoNews 8-28                  Page 8                      15 Jul 1991


     suggested by the process!

     So that is being ABUSED by Tom Hall:

     First a few Mods and make every "Robot messages in the
     problem the sysop of a robot" on the backbone money, Cs, I
     noticed that the "Users the performance of all about. What
     I ENCOURAGE any article."

     A GroupMail conference, DELIVERING it will address the
     first seemed. I have not be prudent or constructively
     inform me, enhance or a large number of the lip robot
     message.

     Therefore I am fairly significant increase in creating
     a number of routing scheme are not filtered down to the GMD
     1.28 by Tom Hall

     As it has been suggested by Mr. Johnstone, and keeping
     in which he can indeed be something that I call your
     attention to spend a deterrant to me hasten to my net which
     I needed for the sudden influx of my net, it.  The GMD 1.68
     by.

     I am trying to allow exceptions for something to this
     hobby is not "BOP" actually go THIS way back a mailer and
     John Johnson 666/456. These files on 08 message: The
     anarchist on the least warn people on the best shot.

     FidoNetNews -- I should have little if you didn't
     notice.

     So berated for the decision making process by Tom Hall

     "Low-priority mail which do my duty as we were
     bringing in the sysop with every Backbone Operation
     Procedures 8.60 will and Fidonews, or origin lines were
     appearing with the process."

     A number of late, but we connect, it was being so far
     the moderators, in his opinion that GMD 9.97 is apparently
     from my nickel. Now, and I'm bothered by Tim Pozar

     This "Backbone did not had been received. It came into
     the largest single person on, in this:  2 GMD watchdog went
     WOOF, the coordinating structure has said a better term,
     then create 731 inbound messages were addressed to be
     available in that want to think needs to stop some
     discretion over WHAT mail" actually wrote to be made me for
     file request from 0 Aug 2286.  Unfortunately, I don't feel
     that such an intake workers, as a significant impact on, or

     have to draw any, had 41, enhance or constructively inform
     the anarchist on the seat of social justice.

     The only go to get such an NC Vents His Spleen.

See how much of a difference it makes?  I'll bet it's the
Satanic organ transplant bureaucrats' mother tongue!

                       A review of MRCYPT 1.10
                    Author: Eric Jacksch 1:163/111

     A few issues ago there was an article dealing with the program
PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) for encryption of mail packets to allow
people to read and write private encrypted mail.  There is another
program that will let you run encrypted netmail packets that requires
no extra work other than inserting the command to run the program in
the batch file that runs your system.

     MCRYPT will encrypt the contents of a NetMail (it will not run on
echo areas) message, leaving all ^aKludge lines and message headers
unaffected.  In its non-registered version the program is run using
command line switches to tell it what address you want it to encrypt
from and what address you wish to ecnrypt to.  You must run the program
multiple times to encrypt for different addresses.  Once the program is
registered,  you receive a small Key file and the program will read all
its data out of a control file, and encrypt to multiple addresses, using
different, case sensitive, passwords/encryption keys.

     Additionally, the current version of MCRYPT has the ability to run
mail though external garbling utilities, such as ROT13, JIVE, and
PatSpeak.  Handy if you wish to express displeasure at the new GMD, as
you can use a mail robot such as MBOUNCE to return the messages, and
run them through Jive to show how you really feel.

     While it is currently against FidoNet policy to route encrypted
mail though systems without their prior approval, other more enlightened
networks have no objection.  Also, the routing of encrypted mail, in
some countries, may actually decrease possible legal responsibilities
as you can show that you route/forward any and all netmail that is in
transit through your system, and to the best of your knowledge there was
no illegal content in the messages.

     A copy of MCRYPT is always available for File Requesting from the
author's system 1:163/111 (Ottawa, Ontario) or from my system which is
a beta test site.  On both systems the magic name is MCRYPT.

Introducing OCAT


About 15 months ago, I became an Opus CBCS sysop.  Along the path from
then to now I have had help from many people and from many pieces of
software.  Now, as I gaze out over the Meadow, I notice others asking
the  questions I had once asked.  So I have decided to do a little
something to pass on those many favors I have received.

OCAT, the Opus Catalog of Amazing Things, is a listing of available
utilities and helpful files that an Opus sysop might find useful. The
only files that would not be useful are those that are "very" specific
to another bbs package.  I quote the word very because some software
can be used in unique ways.  For example Waffle can be run as a door
for Usenet access.

OCAT will be a living database, much like the software list at the end
of each FidoNews.  The database itself will be available in a number of
formats.  You can file request the magic word OCAT from my board at
1:373/12 (HST/V32bis) which will give more information should you be
interested.

The purpose of this letter is to solicit response from authors that
have items they wish to include in OCAT.  Following is a simple form
that you can complete and send to me.  And remember, send updates as
you make them available.

     Program Name     : (1)
     Version          : (2)
     Opus Version     : (3)
     Release Date     : (4)
     Release Filename : (5)
     Software Class   : (6)
     Author  : (7)

     Keywords : (10)
     Description : (11)

Description of items listed in the form above.

 1.  Name that the program is known as.  If your program name is an
FidoNews 8-28                  Page 11                     15 Jul 1991


     acronym, you should use what is most common.  For example, OBUL
     is Opus Bulletin Utilization Language, but it is most commonly
     called OBUL (oh bull :-).
 2.  Version number of program for this description.
 3.  Version of Opus this program supports. (e.g. 1.0x, 1.2x, any)
 4.  Date author released this version.
 5.  Filename, without extension, author used for released program.
 6.  Type of software:
        Commercial
        Public Domain (all rights released)

        Shareware (fee for continued usage)
        Crippleware (fee required to enable all features)
        Nagware (fee required to turn off annoying screens)
 7.  Author's name.
 8.  Author's fidonet address for correspondence.
 9.  Other addresses for author.  (Usenet, US Mail, phone, etc.)
10.  Words that categorize the program, useful for quick searches.
11.  Paragraph description of programs function, usage, requirements,
     compatibility and such.  Might also include where the program is

I keep reminding myself of how good I really have it.

I have a lovely little house; I drive a late model car. I can make
financial contributions to organizations like Circle or the local
hospital when they ask. Life is good.

And yet, I sometimes succumb to the temptation of playing the "I
don't have enough" game. I don't have enough to buy that 100 acre
parcel of forest land that I really want. I don't have enough to
take the cruise down the Rhine and the Danube that my mother is
treating herself to. If I make up a list I could probably come up
with a number of ways to blow my first million within a month.
(These things take time, you know.

It's no secret that this is a consumer oriented society. I find it
fascinating to read in the papers where an economist says, in a
three inch column article, "Save more, save more!" while the full
page ad across from it screams "spend more, spend more!" Is it any
wonder why people pick the latter course? I think that shopping has
become a substitute for sex for some people.

FidoNews 8-28                  Page 12                     15 Jul 1991


The interesting thing that I see is the position of the Pagan
community vis a vis money. On the one hand we reject the nature of
the modern economic system, the Wage Slavery that people subject
themselves to for a half-century of their life span. We don't agree
that any human has the right to buy and sell a precious resource
like land.

On the other hand, I see great interest in actually buying the
land, assuming that we hit the lottery next week. After all, who
makes the kind of money to buy land out in the country?

As funny as this may sound, this article began with my diet. I have
been on my diet for over a decade now. My weight has varied with
the seasons, but I have managed to lose about fifty pounds.

Now I am stuck at a plateau, hopefully the last plateau ever. I
have come to recognize that, in order to lose the last ten pounds
I want to lose that I will have to understand more fully the nature
of my appetite.

For years I have been under the impression that I had to eat until
I was full. That was the nature of the beast. That was how I came
to be 245 pounds. My family had a term: we called ourselves the
Beef Trust, and all the members were at least six feet and 200
pounds. I was proud to be a member.

Then I discovered that you didn't have to eat in this fashion. You
could stop when you were no longer hungry. You didn't have to fill
up. Lo and behold, whenever I would eat in this way, the pounds
would melt off. Then a party weekend, or a weekend with the family,
would come along and I'd balloon back up again. It has been a
struggle.

Which brings me back to the topic at hand. It seems that Americans
are trained to eat until we are full. If it's not food, it's a new
car, new clothing, or the latest in compact disk players. The
old programming is still there. We may deny it aloud, but parts of
us still want the Good Life, as evidenced by L.L. Bean and five
acres of land.

Most Pagans I know are doing okay and would like to be doing
better. I know of one Pagan Prosperity group, and even a Pagan
investment club. But, despite all the interest being shown, there
doesn't seem to be much progress in anyone's finances. If we are
capable of so much magick, why not?

First, it seems that many Pagans just don't believe that magick
works in the "real world."

Bulls**t! Magick works in Assiah, as this plane is known in the
Qabalistic system, as well as in any other, if you understand the
rules. Rule number one is that the denser the plane, the more
energy and time are required to effect changes.

FidoNews 8-28                  Page 13                     15 Jul 1991


How many of us have met others who "only work up on the planes?"
Isn't this just another way of saying I can't cope with the real
world, that I can't have things my way, so I'll just ignore it?

Let's look at an example, namely our dwelling places. Have you ever
walked into someone's house and had your skin start to crawl as you
scoped out the downstairs: dirty dishes and pizza boxes strewn
about the living room, roaches crawling around the dining room, a
green scum encrusting the kitchen sink. And then there's the
upstairs: a bathtub that still has standing water from the hairball
that lodged in the drain last week, a catbox full to overflowing
from an indignant cat, laundry strewn from one end of the bedroom
to the other. That was my house, once upon a time. Those that know
me now (my wife included) find it hard to believe the circumstances
that I lived in more than a decade ago, but, admittedly, it is
true. I was a lazy slob.

Of course, my house now is not the cleanest, but I am not ashamed
if we have company drop in. It took me a decade to recognize that
the condition of my house is a reflection of my mind and my magick.

There is a term that comes from the Qabala and ceremonial magick
that reflects this. It is called the Master of the Temple. (As a
side note for students of language, I might mention that "Master"
refers to one who has mastered, and can be either male or female.)
Mastery must be absolute. One small leak will allow a large amount
of manna to escape. Our dwelling is, in a very real sense, our
temple. Therefore, if we are not in control, Masters, of our
Temple, we are not in control of our magick.

The same is true of my body. If I look at it with a sigh and say,
if only I could do something about it, then I am admitting that my
magick is for nought in Assiah. Start out small. Go for a walk
every day. Start to jog. Take up swimming. Get control of your
diet. It will take time, a year or more, but in the end, the
control that is gained is worth the price in discipline. All your
magicks will gain more power as you gain power in the Kingdom.

I might mention that the state of your house or body that makes you
happy is not the same as what makes your neighbor happy. If you
have three kids, it's going to be a big struggle just to keep the
house picked up after them. If you're fifty years old, you have a
different set of body expectations than the twenty year old gymnast
down the hall.

The second rule for making magick in Assiah is that convincing
people is the easiest way to get things done. One person could
hardly have flown to the moon. A crew of thousands did. This is
where the art of salesmanship comes in.

Look at the War in Vietnam. For several years, anti-war protesters
told the rest of the American public that the War was wrong. And,
for all those years, American involvement kept creeping up and the
rest of society looked at the protesters as kooks and Communists.
The tide of public opinion did not turn until four Americans were
martyred at Kent State, plus two more at Jackson State in
FidoNews 8-28                  Page 14                     15 Jul 1991


Mississippi. Only then did Americans stop, pinch themselves, and
realize the bad dream they had been having. Only then did the
Vietnam War come to an end.

Why didn't the protesters have more of an effect on the American
public? They broke the basic rules of salesmanship. They said,
"You're wrong. You're doing something evil and stupid." Of course,
John and Joan Public do not like being told that they are evil and
stupid (for so they heard it), especially when they had been told
all their lives that it is the right and courageous thing to do.

The right way to approach salesmanship is to complement the
customer, to show how smart and intelligent the customer is for
turning his or her ear in this direction. Surely so discerning a
person can see the advantages in my product. In this case, the
product does not have to be a thing. It can just as easily be an
idea or philosophy. It is only when the public is sold on the idea
that the environment will be cleaned up.

Do you want to make a lot of money? Find a product that you like,
a product that you yourself are sold on, enough so that you own and
use it yourself. Then go out and sell it to others.

There's only one more thing to be said about prosperity. I've
mentioned the concepts of fullness and not being hungry, but
perhaps the answer lies in a different concept altogether. Perhaps
it is not the quantity at all that makes the difference, but the
quality. Maybe what we should do is practice being satisfied with
what we have.

Satanism

by Steve Hayes
of 5:7101/20
P.O. Box 7648, Pretoria, 0001 South Africa

In Fidonews 827 there was an anonymous article about Satanism,
which said, among other things:

     Satanism does not teach that we are the descendants of the
     incest. According to the Christian bible, we are. Satanism
     does not regard humans as a devolving species as Chris-
     tianity does. Satanist's look forward to the next day with
     promise and hope in life. Christianity looks forward to
     armageddon, death and destruction. Satanism does not condemn
     non-baptized children to hell.

All that is very questionable indeed. What is satan? Satan is not
a name, but a noun. The word means "accuser". According to the
Christian Bible the Satan is the public prosecutor (I believe you
call it the District Attorney in the USA) in the heavenly court.
The Satan takes his job very seriously, and, like many earthly
prosecutors, regards a conviction as a success and an aquittal as
FidoNews 8-28                  Page 15                     15 Jul 1991


a failure. He does this to the extent that justice itself is per-
verted. When he brings a case against Jesus (who was found guilty
in the Jewish court of Caiaphas, and again in the Roman court of
Pontius Pilate, but in the court of ultimate appeal Jesus is
aquitted), Satan not only loses his case but loses his job, and
is tossed out of court by Michael, the chief bouncer. Outside the
court he is out to get anyone whom he sees as being in any way
connected with his getting fired - and that includes the human
race in general, and Christians in particular.

What I find difficult to understand is why anyone would want to
worship a jumped up prosecutor who thought he could get promoted
to judge by perverting the ends of justice, and not caring
whether the innocent were punished as long as the guilty did not
escape. The Satan wants EVERYONE in hell.

Christians have often failed to live up to their faith, and have
ranted and flamed and made all kinds of accusations against all
kinds of people. That kind of behaviour is indeed satanic,
whether it is done by Christians or anyone else, because
"satanic" is, by definition, the making of accusations. It is
therefore quite possible for Christians to be more satanic than
Satanists. But Satanists who don't go round making accusations
against people aren't living up to their calling either!

Fido 125/7          Home-made Energy Echo

We have a new conference on Homemade Energy echoing around the
country and want to invite you folks to join us. Renewable and
sustainable energy systems make a lot more sense for our nation
and for us as individuals. They open up possibilities in where
we can live and work with energy independence and much reduced
pollution created for the energy we consume. HOMEPOWR is about
these possibilities, and the hard technical aspects of doing it
using a hands-on approach dealing with "personal" sized systems.

Some of the topics discussed are: Photovoltaic Systems, Wind
Power, Hydro generation, Hydrogen generation and fuel cells,
Rural Living, Solar Heating (water & air), Battery storage
systems and cogeneration. We also post notices of renewable
energy events (shows, schools, partys) and associations that
promote renewable energy. This conference should be an useful,
interesting and appropriate use of our bandwidth. We are
currently sending this directly to several other systems around
the country and are distributing it direct to two regional hubs.
We are in the process of contacting all REC's to ask if they will
accept a feed from us for their regions so we hope to have this
echo widely available very soon (and eventually on the backbone).
Please ask after the HOMEPOWR echo in your area and ask that it
be made available if it isn't.

FidoNews 8-28                  Page 16                     15 Jul 1991


The echo is inspired by and loosely (very) affiliated with "Home
Power" magazine. They accept no responsibility for whatever
mischief we get ourselves into but are supplying us with the text
of many articles they've published over the years to post online
(to the echo and for download) and will probably participate with
us online as soon as we can set them up a node nearby. We will be
publishing a list of access points to the echo in various print
media which will both promote the echo and make a large pool of
practical expertise available. The HOMEPOWR echo will also be
going on the road, to the Solar Expo in Willits CA and the Tour
de Mendo electric/solar vehicle rally shortly. All in all we
think the echo will be quite interesting and invite you to join
us! Thanks for your time.....DCK, Moderator HOMEPOWR

Whose vote is it anyway?

Ever since the IFNA vote debacle, one thing has troubled me as a lowly
sysop.  Whenever we have a vote, a failure to vote (otherwise known as
an abstention), is counted as a No vote.

This method of vote counting almost guarantees the "failure" of any
measure placed before the sysops.  (Incidentally, it would guarantee
the "failure" of almost any measure placed on a public ballot as
well.)  I enclose failure in quotes, because the only "failure" that
occurs, is that the measure fails to pass.  ie.  Should we keep IFNA?
Gee, all those abstentions killed it.  Had the measure been worded,
shall we disband IFNA, the abstentions would have surely rescued it.

Lest we forget what abstain means, I quote Webster's New 20th Century
Dictionary, "abstain: in a general sense, to forebear, or refrain
from, voluntarily; to refrain from indulgence....."  Nowhere does it
say, that one agrees, supports, condones, disallows, denies, or
prohibits, anything.  It says merely that one chooses not to do
something, which is in this discussion, is to vote.

By counting my abstention on any matter, as a vote for, or a vote
against, my abstention, and all the other non-votes are being used
without permission for the anti-side.

Because one neglects or refuses to vote, it does not mean automatic
endorsement for the nay sayers.  It could stem from not bothering to
keep informed, not caring which way the vote goes, believing that the
votes on your side are already sufficient in number, or that the final
date to vote sneaked up on the sysop who might just be occupied with
something other than a CRT.

FidoNews 8-28                  Page 17                     15 Jul 1991


In the light of recent voting traditions, I would like to propose a
vote.

Resolved: "That we keep on using abstentions as No votes."  All
abstentions, will of course, be counted as a vote against this
measure.

See how easy it is to correct the problem?  See how easy it is to have
abstentions turned into something they were never meant to be?

Fantasy Sports are quickly becoming one of America's new national
pastimes.  To help answer questions, give advice, or exchange
general information, a new echo has been formed.  The tag name
for the echo is FANTASY_SPORTS.  If you play any fantasy sports,
want more information on the leagues, or have advice on how your
league is run, this echo is for you!

Baseball, football, basketball, and hockey are the main sports
which are played in fantasy leagues.  Discussions on any of these
sports may be discussed.  This echo will definately be a benefit
to all sports fans who also play fantasy sports.
