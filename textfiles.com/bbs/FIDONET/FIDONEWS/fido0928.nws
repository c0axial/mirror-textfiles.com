Editorial: Remotely yours

by Tom Jennings (1:1/1)

Your intrepid reporter is still (still) at a secret remote location
somewhere in the Specific NorthWest.

This will be the last week that FidoNews is done remotely at this
time. Amazingly enough, when I called in, expecting the usual, weekly
NO CARRIER, it all worked! I started extra early today, assuming
everything would go wrong.

A nice short Snooze today. One article, one echo announcement. The BBS
here answered the phone. Assuming it does a second time (one call I
read mail, move articles around; I hang up, write this gunk; second
call I upload it and produce the FidoSnooze file) I might even get out
of here this afternoon!

It look like the modemectomy that Tim Pozar performed last week on
FidoNews BBS (1:1/1) worked -- the patient survived.

A day in the life of a sysop.

June 30, 1992

    I came into work this morning to find my BBS had crashed during
midnight maintenence. This happens about once every two weeks now, I
have a little utility that counts how many times a file has been
downloaded and inserts the number into my FILES.BBS listings, it runs
at midnight, about every 2 weeks I come in to see it staring at me
from the screen. It's been sitting there since midnight. Ususally a
reboot and a re-run of the midnight batchfile clears it up. Not today.
I have removed it from the midnight event and am in desperate search
of a new one that works.

    For some unforseen reason there was no backbone echomail
yesterday, this is very unsettling to my users, they are experiencing
withdrawl symptoms without their 24 hour fix of mail, I just answered
3 messages explaining that there would probably be double the mail
today. Since I poll between midnight and 5:00am for national mail
there is none today, the download counter was counting downloads all
night. I'll have to force a poll during daytime fone rates again so my
users don't die from lack of echomail. So I do the poll. It looks like
my new V.32bis modem will only work reliably when it's locked at
19,200bps, it's supposed be able to lock at 57,600, it errors out when
I lock it above 19,200, it won't accept a 16500 UART chip. So much for
trying to save a dime by bying the cheapest one out there. I can't
wait to see the errors when I add a second line and run this modem
under desqview.

    A customer is here, she insists that she brought the power cord in
when she dropped her computer off for a hard disk upgrade. I pull a
spare one out of my surge protector that the BBS is plugged into.
WRONG CORD, I just unplugged my BBS. It was tossing 2 megs of national
mail. Shit. Plug it back in, D'Bridge continues tossing the mail, the
second of 2 packets that came in. What happened to the first meg of
mail? It's in the bit bucket, I wonder if my message base is still
intact? Mail tossing is complete, 653 messages, it should have been
3653 messages.

I Undelete the mail bundles that D'Bridge had deleted when it tossed
them, there's only 1, the second one, Where's the first one? The bit
bucket, that's where.

I Run CHKDSK/F, found 956,546 bytes in 1 lost chain, convert it to a
file? YES.

I run PKZIPFIX FILE0000.CHK, then PKUNZIP PKFIXED.ZIP, 2 PKT files
extracted, the third one fails CRC check and PKUNZIP aborts.

I move the packets to my inbound files directory and run D'Bridge.
D'Bridge tosses another 1000 or so messages, I'm still missing about
2500 messages, oh well, I read somewhere that echomail is like
Dorito's, They'll make more, lots more.

My C: drive is making funny noises, sounds like bearings. I loaned my
tape backup to my brother a while back, I don't have a backup of my
hard disk.

I fill another cup of coffee and look at my printer, it's buried under
a mountain of tractor feed paper, why? When the download counter
locked up it apparently started the printer, it printed the screen
continuosly until it ran out of paper, about 500 sheets, probably
printed for hours. I look for my cigarette lighter, my cigarette is
already lit, I'm going to burn that mountain of paper along with the
printer.

Two nodes in our net lost hardware due to lightning this week. Our NEC
lost everything but his HST modem, this was our nets HUB for national
echomail, luckily he had spare hardware to bring it back online by the
next day. He is praying to the good hands people that the insurance
will cover it. I don't have insurance. I have a 2 year old surge
protector. My modem is not protected. Our NC lost 2 HST modems
yesterday, probably lightning. I have worse thunderstorms in my area
than they do.

It's 10am, I light my 6th cigarette this hour, I smoke non-filters,
I'm 28 years old, I feel like I'm 50.

Well, it's time to read my daily mail...
