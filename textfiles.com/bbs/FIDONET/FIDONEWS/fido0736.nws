     =================================================================


     Hope everyone has been enjoying themselves in the past week or
     two. And that nobody out there is overly impacted by the events
     in the Tigris-Euphrates region. At least not beyond the cost of a
     "Peace through Superior Firepower" T-Shirt, anyway...

     But to the point of this brief "editorial": Could you folk who
     sent me update information on your software please do so again?

     I'm using a new version of my old favorite message editor and
     the most recent surprise it handed me caused me to lose your
     update messages.

     I can hear my friends chuckling already. So who said I was
     immune to such foolishness anyway? I feel so stupid.

     Sorry about that. I'll be more careful next time. Promise!

     Cheers,
     Vince

     Fido 1:350/21.1

                       What to do with our garbage!

     Each week, you probably throw away two to three cans of garbage.
     If you had to keep all this trash in your own yard, it wouldn't
     take long before even the mailman might have trouble finding
     your address ("Neither snow, nor sleet, nor rain, nor
     garbage....!").

     But you don't need to trash so much trash.  You can easily cut
     the amount of garbage you generate in half or even by two-thirds
     by making a few wise shopping decisions, reusing as much as you
     can, and recycling the rest.  Of all the environmental problems
     you have to contend with, you can probably have the most
     immediate impact on garbage overload just by creating less waste
     in your own home.

     Every day, Americans jettison food, from potato peelings and
     apple skins to the leftovers after supper or the last piece of
     crust in a loaf of bread.  For every ten pounds of garbage the
     average household throws out each week, from one to three pounds
     are food that could be fully recycled.  Here are a few
     suggestions for keeping the treasure out of the trash:

     * Separate your food waste and other organic material from the
     rest of your garbage.  Even if you live in a high-rise apartment
     building, you can keep your food scraps separate from the trash;
     and if you dispose of them in a paper bag, rather than plastic,
     they'll compact more densely in the landfill and make room for
     more garbage (if the landfill is designed correctly organics
     will not decompose, as the landfill should be virtually air
     tight).  To prevent the bag from leaking, put some newspaper in
     the bottom of the bag, or wrap juicy waste in newspaper before
     you toss it out.

     * Compost it.  If you live in a house, townhouse, or apartment
     that is on or adjacent to some parcel of land, you should not
     only separate your organic waste from the rest of your garbage
     but compost it as well.

     Compost is nothing more than decayed organic matter.  In many
     ways, it is the perfect form of recycling, not only because it
     converts organic wastes into rich fertilizer and thereby helps
     restore the soil, but because it's easy.  Once the compost bin
     itself is built, it is just as quick to take your food scraps
     out to the compost pile as to your garbage can.

     * Reduce the amount of organic garbage you produce.  Instead of
     tossing leftovers out, freeze them for later use in soups and
     stews.  Or, if that doesn't suit your cooking style, try to cook
     more accurate portions so that you only prepare as much food as
     you're going to eat at one sitting.  And don't go out to a
     restaurant when you have a refrigerator full of food at home;
     eat what's in the fridge first, and save dining out for an
     FidoNews 7-36                Page 4                    3 Sep 1990


     occasion.

     In addition to food waste, packaging creates an unholy amount of
     trash.  Fully one tenth of the average weekly shopping bill is
     spent on the packaging alone.  To minimize your rubbish:

     * Use cloth napkins and dish towels instead of paper.  Keep old
     towels, stained napkins and cloth diapers around to use as rags
     for mopping up spills.

     * Bring home groceries in the fewest number of bags possible.
     Ask for paper bags and remember, the fewer bags you bring home,
     the fewer you'll have to throw away.  Try to reuse the bags you
     do bring home by taking them back to the store the next time you
     shop, using them as garbage bags, or storing your newspapers in
     them for recycling.

     * Buy food and other products wrapped in the least amount of
     packaging possible.  Skip prepackaged produce in favor of bulk
     fruits and vegetables you can bag yourself, and ask your grocery
     store to stock paper, not plastic, produce bags.  If paper isn't
     available, plastic produce bags can be washed out, dried and
     reused time after time.

     * Use glass dishes and cups and metal silverware instead of
     plastic.  In fact, avoid buying anything that's plastic unless
     it's extremely durable, you can use many times over, and you
     have no other option.

     * Recycle glass and aluminum.  If you can, buy the largest size
     glass container of the product you want, and reuse the container
     at home for iced tea, juice, or other food storage. No matter
     how many containers you reuse, though, you'll reach a point
     where you'll either have to start throwing them out or recycling
     them, along with your aluminum cans.   Ask your local recycling
     center if it will accept aluminum, glass and newspapers.  If
     not, find one that does.

     Remember, if you're not recycling you're throwing it away.

     Mike Riddle
     Fido 1:285/27

                     An Open Letter to Kwityer Bitchin

     Dear Kwityer:

     While the minor brouhaha over the switch from FNEWS*.ARC to
     FNEWS*.LZH appears to have died down now, I still must respond to
     what I think are some problems with your approach. It seems to me
     you are confused over the true nature of both today's network and
     its users.

     While Fidonet started life as a loose organization of computer
     hobbyists, it has grown to be much more than that.  While studies
     show that entirely too many people today are computer-illiterate,
     when Fido got its start the problem was substantially worse.
     Computers were rare and expensive, small and underpowered, compared
     to today.  Initially, much like amateur radio, the content of the
     messages was subordinate to the fact that they were sent.

     Today that has changed.  The typical user of virtually all of the
     bulletin boards that I know about is /much/ more interested in the
     content of the message than the mechanics of how it is transmitted.
     I can think of more than a few sysops who don't know diddly about
     programming, and who are able to run their boards quite competently
     because of the few well-documented programs that are available and
     because of co-operative, friendly net coordinators and fellow
     sysops.

     In today's world, IMHO, some sysops and most users are here
     strictly for the information exchange.  "Fixing a batch file" is
     quite a task for some of them.  This is not intended to be a put-
     down.  I have done quite a few different things in my life and like
     to think of myself as competent and successful.  I use the medical
     system when I need it and, along with most people, I imagine, view
     many operations as "simple."  I wouldn't, however, want to remove
     someone's appendix.  It might be simple to a doctor, but it's not
     simple to me.

     Because of these changes in the network, and if we assume for this
     discussion that the switch to .LZH was a good thing, ranked with
     motherhood, apple pie, and the Fourth of July, we have to make some
     observations:

          1.  We needed notice, at least a week, about the change.
          A lot of people needed to take action, preferably on a
          planned basis.

          2.  We need to remember the difference between portabili-
          ty and interoperability.

     FidoNews 7-36                Page 6                    3 Sep 1990


     Even if the proper executables were available for all machines in
     the network, sysops and coordinators deserved the opportunity to
     prepare on a reasoned basis for the event.  Even a week would
     arguably have been enough, but it's not considerate to do it
     without any notice at all.  In my own mind, it was annoying.
     Probably not excessively annoying, since I use an MS-DOS machine
     and had all the right files somewhere, but still annoying.

     What you appear to overlook is that .LZH utilities were not, and
     maybe are still not, available for all machines used by sysops,
     not to mention users, in the network.  Since the network today
     exists much more for the information it transmits than for the joy
     of transmitting it, this becomes important.

     While the founders of FidoNet were invariably programmers, and
     often talented programmers, such as your yourself appear to be,
     that is simply not the case of users and sysops today.  One simply
     cannot assume that the public existence of source code for one
     machine equates to a working program on another.  /You/ might be
     able to port it over in a relatively short time, but not everyone
     can and maybe it just can't always be done.

     Since LHARC source code is available, we can say that .LZH is
     portable (this might not always be true, but let us assume so for
     this discussion).  It still was not interoperable until someone
     wrote or obtained the utility programs.  In our network we have
     several systems using CP/M.  While within a week or so they were
     able to obtain workable utilities, many of them did not have it
     when the FNEWS*.LZH arrived in the mail.  Other letters in previous
     issues of FidoNews have pointed out that some other systems (the
     CoCO, for example?) still don't have .LZH compatibility.  This does
     not bode well for information exchange.

     Finally, let me point out that someone suggested that it might be
     a violation of policy for an intermediate node in the distribution
     to change the flavor of the compressed news.  Policy, as I remember
     it, provides that:

          2.1.5  No Alteration of Routed Mail

          You may not modify, other than as required for routing
          or other /technical purposes/, any message, netmail or
          echomail, passing through the system from one FidoNet
          node to another.  (emphasis added)

     I would note that FIDO*.NWS is the message, and the compression
     method is a mere technique of transmission.  I personally don't
     feel repacking from .ARC to .LZH is modifying the message.  Given
     the problem of interoperability, it seems to me that it would at
     least be annoying, and perhaps excessively annoying, for a coordi-
     nator /not/ to repack FidoNews for a system that didn't have .LZH
     capability, and his doing so would seem to be purely for "technical
     purposes."

     So Kwityer Bitchin, I think you need to reassess the differences
     between the network of today and the network started by Tom, Dick
     and Harry.  To sum it up, Kwityer Bitchin.

                                 PRECYCLE


     Have you ever heard of "Precycling"?  This is the practice of
     buying products packaged in biodegradable, recycled, and/or
     recyclable material.  One out of every $11 that Americans spend
     on food goes for packaging. In fact, we spent more on the
     packaging for our food last year than American farmers received
     in net income.

     Did you know that:
     * Each American uses about 190 pounds of plastic per year - and
     about 60 pounds of it is packaging which we discard as soon as
     the package is opened.
     * About 30% of all plastics produced are used for packaging.
     * Americans go through 2.5 million blastic bottles every hour.
     * Packaging waste accounts for approximately a third of all the
     garbage Americans send to landfills.
     * Roughly 5 million tons - more than half of all plastics we
     throw away each year - are packaging.

     Simple things you can do when you shop:
     * Keep your eyes open when you shop. everything you buy has an
     effect on the environment - try to make it a positive one.
     * Buy eggs in cardboard - not styrofoam - cartons.
     * Most cereal boxes are made of recycled cardboard. It's easy to
     tell - the boxes are grey on the inside.  The packaging for many
     varieties of cookies, crackers, dry goods etc. are also recycled.
     look for the "recycled" logo, or send for the "Environmental
     Product Shopping List" from, Pennsylvania Resources Council, 25
     West 3rd St., Media, PA 19063.
     * Buy in bulk: It's cheaper, and uses minimal packaging (in some
     places you can even bring your own container).
     * Buy beverages in glass or aluminum containers, which are easy
     to recycle.  You can also choose sauces, condiments, baby foods,
     spreads, etc. that are packaged in glass instead of plastic.
     * Avoid plastic containers, especially "squeezable" ones, which
     are ade up of different types of plastic in several layers, and
     are dramatically non-biodegradable.

     If 10% of Americans purchased products with less plastic
     packaging just 10% of the time, we could eliminate some 144
     million pounds of plastic from our landfills, reduce industrial
     pollution, and send a message to manufacturers that we're
     serious about alternatives.

     The following is an excerpt from a letter I received a few
     days ago:

            Dear Sir;

            We would be grateful if you would, like us, respond to
            this request and help Craig.

            Craig is a seven-year-old boy who has a brain tumor
            and has very little time to live.  It is his ambition
            to gain entry to the Guiness Book of Records for the
            largest number of get-well cards ever received by an
            individual.  Please send a card to:

            Craig Shergold
            36 Selby Road
            Carshalton
            Surrey, CN8 1Ld
            England

     The letter requested that I send this information on to ten
     (10) other people.  As a Fidonet sysop, I have decided sned
     it to the 10,000 plus readers of FidoNews instead.

     Please pass this information on to as many people as you
     can.  Better yet, if you are a sysop, place it as a
     bulletin for your users to read.  Send Craig a card today!

     Very truly yours,


     Brad Thurber, Productive Resources
