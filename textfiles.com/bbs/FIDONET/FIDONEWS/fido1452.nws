     =================================================================

     Another year comes to an end at FidoNews.

     Where are we a year later?

     We still have no International Coordinator. We still can't get six
     guys in a communications network with all sorts of connection
     possibilities to synchronize the delivery of our fundamental
     document - the Nodelist - on a regular basis. At least two of those
     guys don't even communicate with the rest of FidoNet at all.

     Why do some people hang onto Coordinator slots LONG after they've
     retired in office? Is it ego? Inertia? Stupidity?

     We do have our own Internet domain at fidonews.org thanks to jim
     barchuk. We do have people who move Echomail in spite of being under
     continuous attack for their efforts. We used to have a file moving
     network but I haven't seen much of it lately. We still have Sysops
     willing to help other Sysops with technical and sometimes even
     personal problems.

     Does that balance out?

     Zone 4 has a new Zone Coordinator. His first input is in the Letters
     section. This is 100 percent more than his predecessor ever offered.
     He didn't make it into this week's Nodelist in Zone 1, however. [sigh]

     One of our readers needs help getting point operations info. If you've
     got what he needs, please send him some mail.

     What do you think we should expect in the new year?

     C.B.

     I'm sure they perfectly knew about FidoNews, I'll try to explain
     this in the next lines.

     No, he is not RC90. He is just NC900 and was a temporal ZC4.  Ariel
     Nardelli was our ZC4 up to the first days of October. He was a good
     ZC, he made quite a good job from May 1996 to Sept.97 but he didn't
     speak english so it was a little bit difficult for him to communicate
     with you or any other english speaking person.

     Nevertheless he managed to have a translator-friend who helped him to
     participate in some echoes as REGCON.

     Then he left Fidonet for personal causes and named A. Alvarez as a
     temporal ZC4. Alejandro probably didn't tell you at the first time of
     this change because of his temporal condition, he immediately
     organized elections in which I was chosen as the new ZC.  I should
     appear as ZC in the next diff.  [He didn't in Zone 1. Ed.]

     Hi Chris,

     Do you know if there is an echo where I can learn more about running a
     'point system'?   ...or maybe a FAQ that someone has put together for
     people wanting to run a 'point system'?

     Thanks for your help!  (And thanks for your great work on the
     Fidonews..  .)

     A simple question razed
     by Gregg Jennings, 1:331/109

     In 1448 Lee Kindness responded to a question from Rich Veraa:

     > From: Rich Veraa
     > Does anyone know howcome a net in Ontario lists a node in Malasia?

     LE> And can I ask you why it matters? This sort of geographical
     LE> nonsense is damaging to Fidonet - it merely gives some "power
     LE> hungry fiends" something to worry about.

     He asked a simple question. Rather than answering, Lee accuses him of
     being a power hungry fiend?!?!. For a simple question?

     LE> Do a bit of research and find out about Fidonet in Asia and you
     LE> might see why a node would want to be in zones 1 or 2...

     How? Where does one start such research? Read NET_DEV perhaps?
     Certainly asking about it in FidoNews won't do him any good, will it?

     It matters. But there can be a reason for it. It is spelled out how
     and why geography comes into play in assigning nodes in Policy.

     But instead of trying to explain, Mr. Kindness has to use the question
     as a yet another excuse for him to piss and moan.

     People ask "O where, O where has our poor dog gone?" People blame the
     lessening of the NodeList to many things, always technical. It's the
     Internet, or the FTSC, or Policy, or it's the Software, this or that,
     over and over. And nobody offer solutions beyond, "If they just
     published *MY* FSC, it will fix FidoNet!" Like hell it will.

     BBSes get fewer and fewer new callers because BBSes get stricter and
     stricter, with caller ID, callback verifiers, 20 questions asked, wait
     periods, download ratios, etc. etc.

     Usenet offers immediate reading and writing to discussion groups, no
     questions asked. It allows anonymity. There's more freedom.

     FTP and HTTP offers immediate downloading (and searches for) thousands
     of programs, source code, pictures and various other sundries. No
     questions asked. No wait periods. No ratios. There's more freedom.

     And here in the snooze, and in many Echoes, we keep hearing over and
     over, tiny-dick know-nothings constantly pissing and moaning.

     People are leaving FidoNet not because the FTSC are lax in their
     duties. Not because the Internet uses better technology. But because
     BBSes are run under fear of handles and unknown phone numbers. Because
     people are hearing too often from those who want others to give them
     name recognition piss and moan when they don't get it. Because people

     are sick and tired of hearing over and over, the accusations, the
     insults, the complaints and the sheer idiocy that goes on here by
     the vocal minority.

     O yeah. To the virtual schmucks complaining about the NESYSOP NC
     election: The Network Coordinator is appointed by the Regional
     Coordinator. There needn't even be an election.


        Some things are just a little more important than Fidonet.

     New is I've added the Julian-date of each zone-segment from which
     the current nodelist in zone-2 was compiled.

     For the purpose of comparison here's the same info from about 6 months
     ago. (no, zone-5 and -6 did not grow, only the zonal entries of each
     zone now are included in the count and 6 months ago not)

      'Twas the week after Christmas, and all through the counties,
      The people went shopping to return all their bounty.
      The shoppers -- so many! -- roamed warily through the malls,
      All seeking elusive discount Christmas balls.

      The children came, too, and broke out into grins,
      As they watched Mom return orange ties from Aunt Mims.
      The teens prowled the record stores; the dads looked for books.
      A horde of old ladies searched for marked-down crochet hooks.

      Away in the parking lot, nearby spaces were rare,
      Though if you drove far away enough there were plenty to spare.
      The malls were just bustling, the folks dashing to and fro,
      And the prospect of bargains made some shoppers glow.

      Then what to consumers' wondering eyes should appear,
      But a clearance rack of sweaters all made from cashmere.
      I smiled at the shoppers, so lively and quick,
      Everyone was eager to spend the money from St. Nick.

      More rapid than eagles, shoppers came and came,
      Some reciting the stores they'd visit, name after name.
      First Macy's! Then Caldor! And Herman's and Braddock's.
      And don't forget McCrory, Lord & Taylor and Wallach's!
      To the upper level! To the lower level! Thank goodness for the mall!
      Let's shop away, shop away, shop away all!

      And as corridors got crowded and the madness intensified,
      The shoppers greeted waiting lines that stretched out to July,
      Up to the counters the lines snaked inch by inch,
      But then when else is returning ever such a cinch?

      Then in the twinkling of an eye something opened up quite near,
      I stopped and I shook myself.  An available cashier!
      But as I drew up my packages and was turning around,
      Someone raced to the register, beating me hands down.

      She was piled under packages, from her head to her toes,
      And the remnants of Christmas wrapping clung to her clothes.
      After shifting her bundle she began to unpack,
      That's when I realized they were all being taken back!

      Her eyes were glazed, her dimples anything but merry!
      Her face looked tired.  Was she happy?  Not very.
      Her small little mouth was drawn tight as a knot,
      And there at her side were several tired tots.

      She set down her packages, starting with the neon tinsel wreath, Then
      came the toothpick maker and some mechanical chattering teeth.  The
      clerk eyed her wearily, but still the packages came,
      A ring rack, a poster, a plastic Great Dane.

      There was something funny about her, with her passel of elves,
      And I smirked as I watched her, in spite of myself.
      But with a wink of her eye and a twist of her head,
      I saw that once all this was returned there was more shopping ahead.

      She spoke not a word, just went back to her work.
      New play shoes for Willy, a new skirt for work.
      And then pointing a finger and rising up on her toes,
      She broke into a trot as she headed toward the bargain panty hose.

      As she sprang down the aisle, to her children she whistled,
      And they all flew behind her like tiny guided missles.
      But I heard her exclaim as she pranced out of sight,
      "Happy Shopping to all, and to all a good night!"

     Subj: After Christmas II

                  The Night After Christmas

      `Twas the night after Christmas, and boy, what a house!
      I felt like hell, and so did the spouse.
      The eggnog and turkey and candy were swell,
      but ten hours later, I sure didn't feel well.

      The stockings weren't hung by the chimney with care,
      the darned things were sprawled on the back of a chair.
      The children were nestled all snug in their beds,
      but I had a large pack of ice on my head!

      And when I finally dozed off in a nap,
      the ice woke me up when it fell on my lap.
      Then for some unknown reason, I wanted a drink,
      so I started feeling my way to the sink.

      I got along fine, till I stepped on the cat,
      I don't recall what happened after that.
      When I came to, the house was flooded with light,
      although under a table, I was high as a kite!

      While visions of sugar plums danced in my head,
      I somehow got up and back into bed.
      Then what to my wandering eyes should appear...
      but a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer!

      Then the sleigh seemed to change into a red fire truck,
      and each reindeer turned into a bleary eyed buck.
      I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.
      I tried to call out, but my tongue was too thick.

      Then the old devil whistled and shouted with glee,
      while the bucks pawed the earth as they grinned at me!
      Then he called them by names, and the names made me shudder.
      When I heard them, I felt like a ship minus a rudder!

      "Now Eggnog! Bacardi! Now Bourbon and Brandy!"
      "Now Fruitcake! Cold turkey! Gin Rickey and Candy!"
      To the top of his head, to the top of his skull,
      now whack away, crack away, with thumps that are dull!

      And then in a twinkling I heard on the roof,
      the prancing and pawing of each cloven hoof.
      How long this went on, I'm sure I can't say,
      though it seemed like eternity, plus one more day!

      But finally, the night after Christmas had passed,
      and I found I could really think at last!
      So I thought of the New Year a few days away,
      and I've made me a vow that no temper can sway.

      I'm sticking to water - don't even want ice!
      But there's nothing as tasty or nothing as nice.
      The night after New Year's may bother some guys,
      but I've learned my lesson, and now I am wise.

      You can have your rich victuals and liquor that's red,
      but what goes to my stomach won't go to my head.
      So a big Happy New Year to you and to all,
      I'm back on the wagon, and hope I don't fall!
