                   REVISED JOB POSTING CRITERIA

     CareerPath BBS is now accepting Job postings (WITHOUT FEE
     WHATSOEVER) on the following conditions:

     1. It is a bona fide job opening.

     2. That the employer complies with EEO fully!

     3. That the posting is NOT blind and contains an address or
     telephone for response and that the employer is clearly
     identified.

     4. That no intervention is required on the part of the Sysop
     or Cary Hart Associates (the sponsor of CPBBS).

     5. That the posting does not require a response on the BBS.

     6. That the employer promptly remove the posting when the pos-
     ition is filled or otherwise unavailable.

     7. This policy applies only to openings in the DP, MIS,
     technical areas. Any other postings will be promptly deleted.

     This policy is a result of our decision NOT to handle most
     DP searches. We are now informing our client base that they
     may freeely post positions with these guidelines until further
     notice.

     Just for the record, we will NEVER contact any employer to
     solicit an assignment from one of these postings. Again, this
     change in policy is designed to provide an alternative to our
     involvement in recruiting for these positions.

     This MAY result in a substantial increase in job postings. If
     this occurs, I will place another article in FidoNews in order
     to solicit interest in a help wanted echo.

     Another BBS System?

                      New Compact Disk Echo Created


             I'm very happy to announce that I have created a new
     echo conference for users who have an interest in Compact Disks,
     Players and Accesssories.

             Since the CD industry has been very strong since it
     began, I suspect this echo will probably become a very active
     one.  Everyday brings us new products and developments, so this
     should give us a lot of possible topics to discuss!

             On aspect I'm really going to try and promote are
     reviews written by the users of this echo.  Reviews of new (and
     old) Compact Disks may come in very handy when it comes time to
     slap down a few more bucks next time you are visiting your
     favorite music store.  I realize that a number of magazines
     already have this type of feature, but it is not interactive and
     is generally outdated by the time a reader gets his copy.

             At the time this article was written, the Compact Disk
     Echo was only a local echo.  I've already completed the
     preliminary steps involved in placing this echo in the National
     and International areas, but whether this is sucessful or not
     will depend on how well it picks up in the beginning.

             If you are interested in having this echo on your system
     please contact me directly though NetMail, at the node listed
     at the top of this article.  You'll need to add CD_ECHO to your
     areas.bbs files(s).  The echo will be available for polling
     anytime except the NMH.


             I hope you'll help move this echo to the big times...

     Fellow-Fidonians,

     Well  it very well appears that FidoConII is going to be a major
     success.  Reactions  from all over Europe and the Usa  show  that
     Sysops and Users from a lot of countries are going to attend.  We
     are currently in the process of organizing our agenda,  so if you
     have  any suggestions about what should be discussed during  this
     conference, please contact us. We are all ears !!
     A tentative agenda has been published in the major echo areas and
     can be found  at the beginning of the European Nodelist which has
     been sent to all the European Coordinators through out Europe.

     Don't miss this,  it is your chance to meet those people you have
     been talking to electronically.

     Wynn  Wagner WW3<tm> has again confirmed that he will attend  the
     meeting and chances are that IFNA's president Don Daniels will be
     there too.

                      FidoCon '88 in Cincinnati, Ohio
                           at The Drawbridge Inn
                             August 25-28, 1988


     It's still pretty early and we're not quite finished planning all
     the details of this year's event, but I can tell you that
     FidoCon'88 will be the biggest and best FidoCon ever!

     This year we've added an extra day to the conference, and plenty
     of activities to make your visit both fun and educational.
     There'll be lectures, Q&As, meetings, forums, and of course
     plenty of all-night 'bull sessions' in the several hospitality
     suites.  You'll have a chance to finally get to meet, in person,
     all the people you've chatted (or exchanged FLAMES) with.

     All during the conference will be a TeleComputing Expo, where
     major vendors of computers, modems, software, and other products
     and services of interest to the FidoNet Community will tout their
     wares.

     We are also planning a full schedule of activities for spouses
     and family members.  On the slate are: trips to King Island Theme
     Park, The Cincinnati Zoo, Riverboat rides, sight-seeing tours,
     shopping trips, and many more fun things to do.  This year you
     can make FidoCon a family vacation.

     As always, it is up to you to make your own hotel and travel
     arrangements.  This year we're making it a bit easier; we have
     made special arrangements with Delta Airlines, Alamo Car Rental,
     and of course the Drawbridge Inn for special FidoCon'88
     discounts.

     Delta Airlines, as an official sponsor of FidoCon'88, is offering
     discounts of 40% to 70% off their normal coach fares to and from
     the conference.  Alamo Car Rental is also offering special
     FidoCon'88 rates.  Details will be sent to you in your
     registration packet and have been posted in FidoNews.

     Our host this year, the Drawbridge Inn, is offering special room
     rates, in addition to free transportation to and from the Greater
     Cincinnati International Airport.  The following guest room rates
     have been guaranteed for our conference:


                    Building            Single   Double
                    ----------------    ------   ------

     As I said earlier, FidoCon'88 is still a ways off, and our group,
     The Greater Cincinnati Sysop Association is working hard to
     finalize all the details.  Although the final schedules are still
     being put together, we decided to begin accepting early
     registration.  Below are the prices that stand today:

       o The conference registration fee will once again be $60 per

         receive further information in your registration packet.

       o There will be all sorts of goodies: T-shirts, buttons, hats,
         and the like.  Stay tuned for details.

     * Disincorporate IFNA!

        We're not going to take it anymore!

        IFNA claims a mandate.  It had an election once.  IFNA now
     rules based on its membership.  IFNA has been working for years
     and its Board of Directors has been in place for some time now
     and IFNA is fully operational and functional.

        I now propose to all FidoNet Sysops that IFNA's claim on the
     FidoNet is null and void.  It does not represent or deserve to
     have any effect on the FidoNet.  If IFNA can claim its existence
     on the basis of its membership I can challenge this membership
     and IFNA's claim "to" the FidoNet.

        I say that if more people call for IFNA's disincorporation
     then there are IFNA members then IFNA must, as any honorable
     human being would, vote to disband itself and let the various
     Coordinators that make up the FidoNet rule as they did before
     IFNA made its claim.

        I am hereby starting an echo called DISINC.  This echo is
     dedicated to the disincorporation of IFNA.  I am also
     circulating this following message which I urge all FidoNet
     Sysops to spread Far and Wide.  This message or words calling
     for the DisIncorporation of the International FidoNet
     Association should be sent to node 1:132/555 into AREA:DISINC.

        A petition will then be drawn up from all FidoNet System
     Operators calling for IFNA's disincorporation.  If the numbers
     calling for IFNA to disincorporate exceed IFNA's membership IFNA
     will have no choice but to disincorporate.  I hereby challenge
     the IFNA BoD to do what the FidoNet wants done - To do the WILL
     of the FidoNet - no matter what the outcome!

     --- A Resolution --- Cut here ---
     AREA:DISINC
        The corporation of the International FidoNet Association <tm>
     has claimed to represent the FidoNet and it has been trying to
     function in this capacity for some time now.  We've gone through
     IFNA's birth, its growing pains and have struggled to make it
     grow.  Now after it has been in power and has shown us what type
     of organization IFNA is, we, the Sysops of the FidoNet call on
     the IFNA Board of Directors to disband and disincorporate the
     International FidoNet Association.

     Signed,
     <Name>, <Net/Node>
     --- Cut here ---


        Let the sysops of the FidoNet decide IFNA's fate.
     .
     Randy Edwards, Sysop FidoNet node 1:132/555

     -------------------------------------------------

      Resolution 242 of the FidoNet

        I hereby resolve that the International FidoNet Association
     (IFNA) has no right to exist.  IFNA has no right to claim to
     represent the FidoNet.  IFNA's claim of owning the FidoNet
     Nodelist and FidoNews newsletter is null and void.

        IFNA has no right to exist.

                   ----- Cut Here -----

        If you're willing to join in this resolution please do so.
     Mail a copy of it to your local BoD rep and every IFNA Board
     of Director member that you can find.

        It is time for the FidoNet to throw off the yoke of IFNA!
     THERE IS NO MIDDLE GROUND - either support IFNA by sending in
     your $25 to IFNA or resolve to rid the FidoNet of this dangerous
     menace!

                        A New Net in Massachusetts
                       by David Kaufman (1:321/147)

     Starting with NODELIST.077 (barring some unforeseen occurence) a
     new net, Net 322, will form in Massachusetts.  The new net will
     be comprised of nodes from both of the existing nets (Net 321 and
     Net 101).  If you do echomail or have regular correspondence with
     any Massachusetts node, make sure you know which net that node
     will be in.  Here's a list of those which will be moving:

     Vince Perriello, FIDONET 1:141/491
     Bit-Brain Software, <no-Inc>


                    Standards don't always help

     FidoNet<tm>, and for that matter, all of the other nets that are
     using  FidoNet<tm> technology for communications,  is  a  superb
     technical  statement.    Here is an  entire  grassroots  network
     pieced together using standard hardware and communications gear,
     with no extreme technical requirements placed on any one user of
     the  network.  How did it get that way?    We  didn't  get  here
     through imposing a rigorous standard on network development.  We
     got here  through  a  "living  laboratory"  methodology,  and by
     accepting that as  a  hobbyist  network we won't necessarily get
     the mail through on  the  first  try, though always striving for
     that level of excellence.

     One of the people who has benefitted most  through this approach
     now believes that the time has come to get  rigorous.    To only
     implement  to published standards.  To not "make a big  deal  of
     any random group that meets at a wide spot in the road".  Pardon
     me while I cough my lungs up into my handkerchief.

     Okay, I'm back.  Now, why do I disagree with this point of view?
     As  a  netmail  author  and  a  member  of the FidoNet Technical
     Standards Committee I  should  be  cheering this, right?  Wrong.
     We still have work  to  do.    To  limit  what  we can do in the
     network to published specifications would  be very wrong at this
     point.  We still need to  properly  implement  direct  interzone
     mail.   To add other protocols to  our  abilities,  particularly
     such  things as the Janus protocol and the  X.25  code  that  is
     apparently working out so well in Europe, neither of which would
     have  happened  if  we  only allowed our mail transfers to  take
     place  using protocols documented by the FTSC.  Why did I  cough
     (an  impolite thing to do while someone else is talking)?  Well,
     to my  knowledge  there  is  no FTSC document describing SEAlink
     protocol,  SEAlink  Overdrive,   passwords  in  packet  headers,
     procedural guidelines for password  mismatching,  the  so-called
     "BARK" method of requesting files  from a remote system, or even
     the addressing method used by the author of the previous article
     (the  address  was  in  the  form "net1/node1-net2/node2"  where
     apparently  you need to send mail for net2/node2  to  net1/node1
     but who can tell without a document?).

     I  trust  that by now you get a glimmer of  what  I  am  talking
     about.   It's  really  quite simple.  We're all technical people
     here.    But    not   the  type  who  likes  to  write  tons  of
     specifications before coding.   We're  the  type  that  likes to
     write  tons  of code before  touching  a  specification.    That
     includes Thom Henderson.  It includes Tom Jennings.  It includes
     me.  Bob Hartman.  Wynn Wagner.   Many others.  Wynn has written
     a lot of specs but I suspect he  only  does  it because we don't
     (that's a joke, Wynn, really!).  That poses a  problem.   How do
     you wind up with code that actually can COMMUNICATE?

     FidoNews 5-12                Page 16                  21 Mar 1988


     That is  the  role  that  I  see  for  the  FTSC.  Its job is to
     document and maintain  BASELINE  specifications,  and to monitor
     enhancements, bringing specs for  those  enhancements  into  its
     "library" as they mature sufficiently  to  merit  inclusion.  To
     devise reasonable tools to allow enhancements  to  be  tested on
     the  network  without  causing  the  kind  of  disruptions  that
     occurred at least once in recent history (about a year ago) when
     1/0 was running a mail product using an "experimental"  protocol
     that  wasn't quite right yet.  We expect to devise  these  tools
     using  a  session  level  negotiation  based  on  Wynn  Wagner's
     "YooHoo" design, which  is  in  many  respects  similar  to  the
     session negotiation used by the X.25 and SNA protocols.

     There were two points  raised  in  Thom's article that I need to
     address directly:  that of  Echomail  processing  and  of FOSSIL
     specs.  Thom suggests that we  are  at  the  mercy of anyone who
     decides to write an echomail munger that  doesn't  conform  with
     current  conventions.   Well, WITH trust, conventions should  be
     sufficient  until  a  spec  can be written.  WITHOUT  trust,  it
     doesn't  matter  whether  there  is a formal spec or not.    The
     problem of  what  happens  when  a  new,  incompatible  echomail
     processor is introduced  to  the  network  will  no doubt be the
     subject of a future  social  experiment  by  someone  who enjoys
     doing that sort of thing.

     As for FOSSIL, there is  a  specification.  It is published by a
     committee  that  has  had essentially the  same  membership  for
     longer than IFNA has had its corporation  papers.  Omissions and
     changes  are  discussed  in a PUBLIC Echomail conference.    All
     authors  of  FOSSIL  software  have always been welcome in  this
     conference,  even before it was open to the public.   Those  who
     choose out should keep in mind that it is only through their own
     stubbornness or arrogance that they are not involved.

     FidoNet technology  is not mature.  The basic mail protocol used
     by Fido 11w  is  mature.  SEAlink is into puberty.  Use of JANUS
     and X.25 is still in diapers here.   FTSC's  job is to create an
     environment  where  such  experimentation can still happen while
     not threatening the  operation of the network.  Echomail will be
     documented by the FTSC  when  we  get  to it.  There are only so
     many of us.  If  only  those  who  call for specs were better at
     writing them. We can always use cooperative volunteers.

                         The Hermit's Point of View

     How  easy  it  is  to  view  the  "goings on" of the net from the
     comfort of my little hovel, safe from the singeing flames of  the
     Sysops  Conferences,  and the gathering hordes of IFNA opponents,
     IFNA supporters, Alternet Hodads, and everyone who simply doesn't
     give a damn.

     How  easy  too  the life of the FidoNet peasant, such as I.  Away
     from the far flung battle fields of the Fidonet Flames.  So  what
     can  one  learn  from  the backblocks?  Australia is about as far
     away from St Louis as you're about to get!   I've  been  involved
     with  this  whole  Fido  thing  for  a  year now, and I'm no less
     fascinated  by  it  now  than when I first discovered that 8 data
     bits and one stop bit was the combination that  changed  horrible
     garbage   on   my   screen  to  a  veritable  Picasso  of  online
     information, but enough of my exordium.

     `ever  being one to expatiate, I present for your edification and
     mental stimulation extracts from:

                   The FidoNet Buzzword Dictionary
                   -------------------------------
                  (as edited by the Airlock Hermit)

     AlterNet  - An enigma.  A breath of fresh air to "burn-outs", but
     to others: a four letter word.

     Baud - I was told  that  this  has  something  to  do  with  file
     transfers.   So  I  tried a 356,792 byte file transfer at 300 BPS
     and they were right!  I got baud.  Very Baud.

     EchoMail  -  A bit like PolyFilla.  Where Polyfilla will fill all
     the cracks and empty spots in your walls, EchoMail will fill  all
     the  empty  spots  on  your disk.  A 40 Meg drive becomes a 0 meg
     drive.  A Wonderful creation is EchoMail.

     Flame - The stuff that comes out of your 40  Meg  disk  with  too
     much EchoMail on it.

     Opus  -  Opus  is  FidoNet  software  which  really  carries  the
     "Brotherhood" ideal to its limit.  The fact that all OPUS systems
     running 1.03a crashed simultaneously is witness to this.

     Net - A nodular collection of Bulletin Boards.

     Node  -  An  individual point in a nodular collection of Bulletin
     Boards.
     FidoNews 5-12                Page 19                  21 Mar 1988


     Point  -  A  private  node  on  an  individual point on a nodular
     collection of Bulletin boards.

     Sysop - Someone who understands the above.

                      Yet Another Complicated Komment

                            by Steven K. Hoskin
                        ( STEVE HOSKIN at 1:128/11 )

                        Episode 4:  Inter-Net Links


          Yes, I know, you are  probably  getting tired of hearing all
     these different ideas  about  how  to  link  with other Networks,
     especially when I constantly bring up that old FidoNet sore spot,
     AlterNet.

          But  I  will   continue   to  harp  on  my   feelings   that
     communication is the name of the  game, and I will probably never
     stop  harping  on  that  until  everybody  can  communicate  with
     everybody else in just  about  any  way  they please.  Yes, I'm a
     dreamer, but a guy can dream can't he?

          Okay,  Aaron  Priven  commented  in  FidoNews  5-07  (latest
     FidoNews at the time of this  writing) about different techniques
     to use the gateways to get to  other  Networks.  I appreciate the
     obvious technical knowledge  that  went into that article, almost
     as much as I appreciated  his  previous  article on NaughtNet for
     its humorous content.

          Unfortunately, without  a  lot  of  concentration, I was not
     able to keep his train  of  thought  in  line.  The techniques he
     suggested seemed to be  awfully  complicated, and this might have
     been due to my own lack of  knowledge  of how the current FidoNet
     operates.  In any case, his article spawned an idea (I'm prone to
     these things, you see).

          Here's yet another idea for the  gateway technique, assuming
     that the non-gateway  technique  is  administratively infeasible.
     Why not have ONE zone specifically set up for ALL gateways to ALL
     other Networks?  Let's say, for  sake of argument, that this idea
     was implemented, and Zone 9  was  selected for the gateways.  Now
     we have each external (to  FidoNet)  Network apply for a Net/Node
     number inside Zone 9.

          UseNet becomes 9:1; 9:1/0  becomes  the  hub or host for the
     UseNet gateway.  AlterNet  becomes  9:2; the hub for the AlterNet
     gateway becomes node  9:2/0.    ARPANet  becomes net 3 in Zone 9,
     and the list just grows from there.

          Contacting a  user  at  a  known  gateway  is  simple:  send
     network mail to that Node  directly  with  9:x/xxx.  Contacting a
     user whose location is only known  as "Somewhere in such-and-such
     net" could be reached via 9:x/0.

          Now there's a fairly  unlimited  number of other Networks we
     could communicate with, as there  is a fairly unlimited number of
     Nets allowed in any given Zone.

     FidoNews 5-12                Page 21                  21 Mar 1988


          There's  also  a   fairly   unlimited   number  of  gateways
     available within that Network,  as  there  are a fairly unlimited
     number of possible Nodes within one FidoNet Net.

          And somebody who isn't  sure  just  how  to contact somebody
     via FidoNet who is actually in  another Network could send a mail
     message to the  Host  for  that  FidoNet  collection of gateways,
     with the  proper  OtherNet  address  as  the  first  line  in the
     message to that host node.

          It seems to  me  that  there  wouldn't  be  any  problems in
     implementing this plan,  either  administratively or technically,
     I welcome your responses  via  Network  Mail; you can reach me as
     STEVE HOSKIN at 1:128/11.

                             COMMITTEE REPORTS
     =================================================================

     Don Daniels, President
     International FidoNet Association
     1:107/210

                 AGREEMENT WITH DAK ON NODELIST SITUATION


     IFNA is pleased to report that it is now in receipt of Drew
     Kaplan's signature on a Letter of Understanding between DAK
     and IFNA.  We are returning his copy with our approval in
     today's mail and expect that this will be the official beginning
     of a mutually beneficial relationship.  The following is a brief
     explanation of the history of the situation and of the agreements
     reached, along with a letter of apology that was received from
     Mr. Kaplan himself.

     As most of you are aware, DAK hit upon the idea that it would be
     a nice service to provide its customer base with an explanation
     of just about everything you need to know to get into BBSing.  A
     document was published a couple of months ago to accomplish this
     that also included printed portions of one of our Nodelists from
     late last year.  DAK interpreted our copyright notice in the
     Nodelist as saying that they could distribute the Nodelist
     providing they made no profit on it, although they could recover
     "reasonable costs of reproduction and distribution."
     Accordingly, they set up a separate operation to handle this item
     and guaranteed that any revenues received above their costs would
     be donated to the American Cancer Society.

     When word first got out there was a bit of a furor raised within
     the Net because no one here knew who had agreed to what with
     whom.  DAK learned of the expressions of these concerns and
     contacted IFNA in an effort to forestall any possible problems.
     When IFNA first heard of the matter, it was quite upset because,
     although there were obvious benefits for many to be seen from
     DAK's actions, we felt that our rights had not been properly
     respected.  We first responded to Mr. Kaplan in this light but
     two significant factors caused us to seek an amicable resolution:

       o  The first was the obvious interest and respect which Mr.
          Kaplan had of FidoNet, its Sysops, and what they were doing
          for the public, along with his expression of complete
          willingness to do what would be considered right in the
          future.  (Those of us who spoke directly with him on the
          phone were very impressed with his involvement and sincere
          desire to be of service -- he personally responded to all
          our communications).

       o  The second was our own thoughts as to what we really wished
          to achieve from this matter.  To that end we asked ourselves
          the question, "What would we have wanted or done had DAK
          approached us directly in the first place?"
     FidoNews 5-12                Page 26                  21 Mar 1988


     This positive, non-adversarial approach by both parties, although
     it has taken some time to complete due to busy schedules on both
     sides, has proven to be the right one as we feel that there is
     now a personal relationship that extends beyond the written
     agreement that will be beneficial, not only for both sides, but
     for the general public as well.

     The agreement reached includes, among some other considerations,
     the following points:

       o  IFNA will provide a license to DAK to distribute printed
          copies of a subset of the IFNA Nodelist.  For each issue,
          IFNA will remove from its current version, all systems
          marked as mail-only or private.  In addition, IFNA will also
          remove any node which makes a formal request to IFNA in
          writing (at P.O.  Box 41143, St. Louis, MO 63141) that it
          does not desire to be included in such publication.

       o  DAK will change the format of its MODEM USER'S GUIDE to more
          readily accept revisions of the IFNA Nodelist to ensure that
          they are not providing obsolete material.  These new
          editions will provide appropriate credits to IFNA and to Tom
          Jennings, developer of FidoNet.

       o  DAK will provide credits to FidoNet and IFNA in any future
          catalogs that reference the MODEM USER'S GUIDE.  This will
          provide extensive free publicity to FidoNet as these
          catalogs reach over 10 million readers.

       o  DAK not only welcomes, but encourages IFNA's participation
          in the technical editing of its MODEM USER'S GUIDE as they
          are truly interested in promoting this type of activity and
          wish their material to be as accurate as possible.

       o  DAK will provide printed copies of their MODEM USER'S GUIDE
          to IFNA free of charge and allow us to distribute them to
          our users.  This will help IFNA in response to the many
          inquiries we receive through the mail and IFNA phone line.

       o  DAK has indicated a willingness to provide its MODEM USER'S
          GUIDE to us in soft-copy form, so that it may also be made
          available to first-time callers of our systems.

       o  DAK will continue its practice of providing revenues beyond
          its publication costs to the American Cancer Society.

     A word about this last point: the Cancer Society is very
     appreciative, not only of the $20,000 that has been raised for
     its research so far, but for the innovative approach that has
     been utilized here.  We're proud to be a part of it.

     As indicated above, there are several other considerations that
     we expect to share with DAK in the future.  Among offers of
     certain types of resources, DAK has also expressed interest
     in being a supporting vendor at FidoCon '88.  We look forward,
     not only to their support, but to their continued involvement in

     FidoNet's outreach to the general public.

     Mr. Kaplan's letter follows.


     Mr. Don Daniels
     President
     International FidoNet Association
     3 Apex Road
     Melville, NY 11747

     Dear Mr. Daniels:

     As many of your members may know, DAK Industries, Inc.
     publishes the "DAK" catalog and is a mail-order retailer of
     consumer electronics, including computer, software, and
     peripheral hardware such as modems, printers and digitizers.
     As the President of DAK, I have both a professional and
     personal interest in selecting the best products for my
     customers and in providing them the highest possible level of
     support and training in the use of the products they purchase.

     DAK has sold over 50,000 modems over the last 3 years, but I
     always wondered why the sales weren't higher -- particulary since
     over 60% of our customers are computer users.  Our market
     research showed that many computer users -- even so-called "power
     users" -- are intimidated by telecommunications.  To overcome
     what I've started to think of as "modem shyness" I wanted to
     provide our customers with an introduction to using modems; I
     also wanted to give them an example of the exciting things you
     can do with a modem to give them an incentive to "take the
     plunge" and sign on for the first time.

     DAK obtained the FIDO nodelist from a Sysop of a Fido board.  We
     obtained his permission to publish the list, and we published it
     in exactly the form it was given to us.  The license on the
     nodelist permits recovery of reproduction costs, which, as you
     know are substantial; so we charged a nominal fee to provide the
     nodelist to customers who requested it.  Moreover, since DAK had
     no interest in making a profit on the publication of the list or
     in the distribution of the manual on modem use in the event that
     our actual costs turned out to be less than we estimated, we
     decided to donate any proceeds above the actual cost of
     publishing and distributing the nodelist and the manual to the
     American Cancer Society.

     Thousands of customers to date have requested and received the
     nodelist, so we thought our modem campaign was a huge success --
     until we heard from IFNA that it had received complaints from
     some member board's about DAK's publications of the nodelist.
     After extensive conversations with Don Daniels and Bob Hartman, I
     think we've come to a very happy understanding that lets DAK
     support IFNA and its members by giving IFNA and FidoNet free
     publicity to the over 10,000,000 customers who receive DAK's
     catalog and by providing free reproduction and mailing of the
     nodelist in a form approved by IFNA to the DAK customers who
     FidoNews 5-12                Page 28                  21 Mar 1988


     request it.

     As to the past publication, I apologize for any inadvertant
     errors -- we dealt with a Sysop, thought we had permission and
     published the list from a screen dump obtained from a registered
     FIDO board.  Don't misunderstand me...our intention from the
     beginning has always been to inform our customers in the most
     positive way about the fabulous resources of the FidoNet.  Had I
     known about IFNA and most especially about the wealth of
     expertise available there, I would most certainly have "started
     at the top" and obtained permission to publish the nodelist
     directly from IFNA.

     I am delighted to have the input on the nodelist, IFNA, FidoNet
     and DAK's modem manual that I have received from IFNA.  You can
     be assured that in the future, any publication of the nodelist or
     mention of Fido, FidoNet and IFNA will be in a form that has been
     reviewed and approved by your fine organization.  And, I am more
     than happy to continue to support all member boards who so desire
     by reproducing and mailing at no cost to IFNA or its members, and
     at no profit to DAK.

     I look forward in the future to happy and cooperative dealings
     with IFNA and its member boards so that DAK customers can be
     introduced to the tremendous resources FidoNet offers and IFNA
     and its members can have access to the millions of potential new
     members that DAK's customers list represents.

     Best regards,

     (signed by)

     Drew Kaplan
     President
     DAK IDUSTRIES, INC.

     Don Daniels, President
     International FidoNet Association
     FidoNet 1:107/210


                 IFNA President's Report - March 12, 1988


     To start off with, I must apologize to you all for some of the
     lack of information recently.  There are several reasons for
     this.  First of all, so much has been happening that there has
     not been enough time left over to get mobilized on providing you
     with results of some of the things we have accomplished or
     updates on work in progress.  Please remember that this is in no
     way attributable to any attempts at "secrecy" on our part.  To
     the contrary, it has been my policy and that of other board
     members to respond to all communications addressed to us, to
     ensure that we are responsive to your viewpoints.

     To quite some extent, however, this policy has added to our
     inefficiencies as certain individuals have been pulling our
     chains just to see us jump, I guess.  This has really distracted
     all concerned from the business at hand with the end product that
     FidoNet is not being as well served as it should be.  As a
     result, I must sadly say that it has become necessary to change
     that policy to a small degree -- in the future we will continue
     to respond to all communications that obviously have been sent
     with a conscientious desire to accrue to the benefit of FidoNet.
     Criticism, as long as it is basically of a constructive nature,
     is, of course, still encouraged.  However, material that has
     obviously been entered in a destructive vein will have to be
     ignored or returned to the sender with a request for revision.

     My node number is published at the top of this article and
     appears in the Nodelist (except this past week due to a technical
     problem here in Region 13).  We are participating in the IFNA
     EchoCon and, if you were to look, you would also discover that I
     maintain a listed voice line.  I've taken this position this year
     because I wish to serve FidoNet -- and as FidoNet is made up of
     sysops like you, it follows that we are here to serve you.  If
     you have a problem with what we are doing or not doing and
     sincerely wish to make it right, please feel free to contact us.
     My admonition from FidoCon still holds true: Don't tell us what
     we're doing wrong, tell us how to do it right!  For one, I
     promise that I will listen and do whatever I can to accommodate
     your wishes for FidoNet's future.

     Now, on to business!  There are quite a few things that we are
     really excited about.  First of all is FidoCon '88.  The BoD
     received quite a report from the organizing committee of the
     Greater Cincinnati Sysop's Association.  We were all very
     impressed with the scope of what they have planned, their
     enthusiasm and preparation, and the prospects for a great
     conference.  More word on the many specifics they have planned
     will come directly from them in the weeks ahead.  I can tell you,
     though, they have some nice surprises in store for you.
     FidoNews 5-12                Page 30                  21 Mar 1988


     We have already received some very positive feedback from IFNA's
     Statement of Position that was created and passed by the Board of
     Directors and published in last week's FidoNews (#510).  If you
     missed it, I suggest that you go back and read it because it
     makes it quite clear that what IFNA considers to be its position
     relative to FidoNet does not coincide with what has been
     attributed to IFNA by its detractors.

     There is a spirit of cooperation and accomodation that runs
     through that statement and it has already been manifested in
     several ways.  Not only was the board meeting itself a fine
     example but a couple of initiatives promise to extend this in the
     weeks ahead.  An EchoMail Policy Committee is being formed - not
     unilaterally by IFNA - but JOINTLY with the EchoMail Backbone and
     the Regional Coordinators.  It is expected that they will provide
     equal representation to a combined committee that will hammer out
     policies that all sides can whole-heartedly accept.  You should
     be able to hear progress reports on this activity in the weeks
     ahead.  A similar joint project has also been initiated with the
     Regional Coordinators to work on possible revisions to POLICY3.
     We expect that whatever comes out of these committees will
     demonstrate that all parties are actively joining toward the
     common good of FidoNet and that FidoNet is indeed "one" --
     a composite entity with proper delineation between its parts.

     There has been one item about which we on the Board have remained
     PUBLICALLY silent and that is the concern with DAK and the
     Nodelist.  We have, however, indicated in various forums that
     negotiations were proceeding, but as certain legal issues were at
     stake, we were advised to wait until a full agreement had been
     worked out.  I'm pleased to say that we feel this approach has
     been very fruitful and that we now expect finalization of our
     agreements early this week.  Barring any unforseen difficulties,
     we should be providing a full report here next Monday.

     As can be seen from the above (and a bunch of somewhat lesser
     concerns I haven't mentioned now but which you should soon hear
     about), quite a few things are going on and progress is indeed
     being made.  Yes, it is a slow process because whatever we
     undertake, as volunteers, has to compete for our time with
     family, friends, jobs, and the other important factors in life.
     Please try to bear that in mind if we seem a little unresponsive
     at times.  And remember, if you have a real problem that you wish
     to work out, do contact us.  We are here because we wish to be of
     service to FidoNet.
