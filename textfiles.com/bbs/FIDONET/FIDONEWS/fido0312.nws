                             A BBs User's View


          As a subscriber to numerous BB systems I feel it's time  for
     me to speak my piece on open and closed systems.

          This week three of the BBs I call were crashed by people who
     have nothing better to do with their time than hurt other people.
     It's  a  real  pain  in the you know what to us,  the honest sub-
     scribers,  to have to fill out new user forms every few weeks  on
     systems  that  have  been  crashed.  We moan and groan,  and have
     numerous  discussions  via  the   message   systems   about   how
     troublesome all of this is to us.

          That was my attitude until this week, when I decided to look
     into  the  idea of opening my own BB.  I picked up some decent BB
     software and started rummaging through the  documentation.  Golly
     whiz,  there  sure is a lot to do being a Sysop.  Not only do you
     have to make up menus,  dedicate a computer or two to the system,
     buy  phone lines and modems,  but then after all that guess what,
     you've got to spend time every day to maintain the stupid  thing!
     You  get to edit files,  write bulletins,  maintain numerous file
     directories,  come up with great ideas to keep your users  happy,
     and  all  of this is in most cases is done for free.  Sounds like
     real fun doesn't it?

          After you've committed to having all  that  fun,  you  spend
     weeks  obtaining  great  files  for  all  your wonderful users to
     download,  because if you wait for them to give you a file or two
     you'll  be out of business.  After all,  subscribers (or should I
     more properly call them users?) haven't the time or  patience  in
     most  cases to watch their computers sitting there uploading.  It
     takes too much time to upload.  Downloading is much, much faster.
     2400, 1200,  300 or whatever baud is a lot faster going downhill.
     Any idiot knows that !!

          So  now  you've got the system up and working.  You're proud
     of your work, open the system to the general public.  You're high
     minded (or stupid and naive) enough to  think  that  everyone  is
     like  you.  But  you're  wrong!  Two weeks after the system is up
     some yokel (I have other descriptions) puts a little worm in your
     system, and guess what you get....CRASH!

          Now you're in real trouble.  No don't  worry,  Mr.  or  Mrs.
     Sysop,  it's not the crashed system that's the problem,  it's the
     wonderful users who'll be upset when they  have  to  re-register.
     They  may  never  call  back  again!  Wouldn't  that be horrible.
     You'd have all that equipment just sitting around doing  nothing.
     So  the good old Sysop decides to redo everything,  and the BB is
     back in business.

          After studying the situation,  I've  become  convinced  that
     most  Sysops  must  be nuts.  Who would do all that for free?  In
     talking to these lunatics I've found most to be dedicated to  the
     idea  of providing a useful service.  One asked what I thought of
     him closing the system to  the  general  public.  My  answer  was
     simple.  I am a subscriber to both free and pay BBs.  I find that
     closed  systems  are  generally  better.  Why?  Simple,  a person
     values  something  he  or  she  purchases.   Are  these  lunatics
     (Sysops)  providing  us  with  a  service?  To me the answer is a
     definite YES!  Most of the programs I use  were  free  because  I
     obtained  them  via  BBs.  Much of the really important knowledge
     I've acquired has been found in BB message bases.  And  you  know
     what?  Most  of those above mentioned "mosts",  if you understand
     my meaning, came from pay services.

          I don't want to single any system out,  but for the sake  of
     example  I'm  going  to  use Gene Plantz's system.  He charges an
     outrageous rate of a whole $15.00 per year for  membership.  When
     I  enter  a message on his system,  asking for advice,  help,  or
     whatever,  I can count on getting several answers within hours at
     most  from  other subscribers.  I can enter the same message on a
     free system, and guaranteed, I usually get zip.

          The point I'm trying to make is maybe we  get  what  we  pay
     for.  Maybe free systems are becoming a thing of the past.  Maybe
     that's  the  way  it  should  be.  I'd  never  NOT pay for Gene's
     service.  It's been too valuable to me.

          After looking into becoming the  Sysop  of  my  own  system,
     estimating  the  time  and effort that would have to be expended,
     I've decided that I really couldn't afford to give it  away.  I'd
     have to charge a fee.  So why shouldn't others do the same?

          I'm  really not trying to be a preacher.  I'm just trying to
     put things in perspective.  Could we users become Sysops and give
     our services away?  The answer is no,  because  if  it  was  yes,
     everyone would be running a BB.

          How much is a fair price?  I don't know,  I'm god-like,  not
     God.  How much does a movie cost?  A  matinee  is  pretty  cheap,
     providing you don't have kids who want candy or pop.  Should I be
     willing to pay the cost of a couple of movie tickets for a year's
     membership on a BB?  Maybe.

          What  should  I  do if the Sysop decides to keep his service
     free?  Maybe I should participate in discussions,  upload a  file
     or  two once in a while?  Not a bad idea.  Maybe I should express
     my views, share some of my knowledge,  contribute for the benefit
     of the service,  and the other subscribers.  Who knows, if others
     did the same, we all might learn a little something.  Possible?

          I'm done spouting off now.  I was  really  aggravated  after
     talking to a couple of these Sysops in person,  learning of their
     honest desire to provide a service,  and then calling back to see
     that   their  systems  had  been  crashed.   I  guess  you  can't
     understand the other guy's point of view until you know him.

          In conclusion,  whether  the  service  is  free  or  whether


     Fidonews                     Page 3                   24 Mar 1986





     there's  a  small charge isn't the issue.  I've learned that what
     really motivates the person who becomes a Sysop is the desire  to
     help.  What  turns  most  of them on is not money,  but an active
     group of subscribers sharing not only programs, but knowledge.

          These services are of great value to us,  the computer  user
     community,  and  should treated with some degree of respect.  The
     hackers and slackers have to be eliminated one  way  or  another,
     and  if  fees help,  well that's the way it is.  It doesn't do us
     any good to have free service  if  the  service  isn't  available
     because it's been crashed.

          I'd  like to thank several subscribers on Plantz's board for
     knowledge they've shared with me,  but guess what,  I don't  even
     remember  their  names.  It  doesn't matter though,  because I've
     given help where  I  could,  and  I'm  sure  those  people  don't
     remember  mine  either.  The  whole  point is that all of us have
     gained.

          Thanks for your kind indulgence.

                        Is There Anybody Out There?

     Somewhere out there among all you Fidonews readers there must  be
     some  amateur  astronomers.  This letter is addressed to those of
     you who are,  have been,  or would like to  be  involved  in  the
     computing end of amateur astronomy.

     A  year or so ago,  several Fido sysops banded together and began
     mailing around a box of 10 floppies. The originating Sysop filled
     the first diskette with utilities,  games and other software that
     he  considered  to  be useful.  He then mailed the box off to the
     next sysop who copied the first diskette onto a blank of his  own
     and  then filled the second diskette as the first sysop had done,
     hopefully avoiding duplication. After the last sysop had done the
     same,  the box was mailed back to the originator who  reformatted
     the  disk which he had originally filled,  copied more files onto
     the now blank disk,  copied all the other full  disks,  and  then
     sent them all on to sysop number two again.  This was a great way
     to  keep  the software flowing.  I would like to suggest the same
     sort of operation for the amateur astronomers out there.  Contact
     me on 138/0 if this scheme interests you. You DO NOT have to be a
     sysop to get in on this thing.

                    FOUR HARD QUESTIONS ABOUT HARD DISKS
                    ------------------------------------


     I have some questions that have been nagging  me  for  some  time
     about  the IBM PC and hard disks.  I am posing these questions to
     the general Fido community at large confident  that  someone  out
     there knows the answers.

     If  you do know how to solve one of these problems,  send mail to
     me at 102/115.  If you just want to know the answers,  send me  a
     note  also.  If  enough  interest in the answers is generated,  I
     will summarize in a few weeks and post the results in FidoNews.


     1.  GETTING MORE THAN 2 HARD DISKS ON AN IBM PC
     --  -------------------------------------------

     Some time ago, I developed a situation where I had numerous small
     hard disks (10,  15 meg) left from upgrading my IBM-PC's  and  my
     client's  IBM-PC's.  Now the market for used Miniscribe 2012 hard
     disks is pretty grim,  but eight  of  them  constitute  80Mb  and
     that's almost interesting.

     Now, the IBM PC/XT hard disk controller has two jumpers on it AS1
     and  AS2  that  control  the ports that it is addressed at.  (IBM
     Technical Reference 6025005 page D-64.) So does the DTC  5150-BX,
     W1 and W2.  Normally the controller is addressed at 320H, but can
     be readdressed to 324H, 328H and 32CH.

     Furthermore,  the  IBM  PC/XT  Fixed  Disk BIOS also knows how to
     address all four controllers! See IBM Technical Reference 6025005
     Page A-88, lines 82,  83;  Page A-95 lines 627 - 633;  Page A-107
     lines 1560 - 1585.  So does the DTC.

     PC-DOS  2.1  FDISK  even  knows how to set up partition tables on
     hard disks connected to extra controllers.

     However, PC-DOS 2.0, 2.1, 3.0 and 3.1 all barf horribly when they
     are booted and more than two hard disks with DOS  partitions  are
     connected.

     Does  anyone  have  a  patch  for DOS (preferably 3.1) that fixes
     this?

     Is  there  an  installable  device  driver  that  I  can  use  to
     accomplish the same thing?

     Is  someone else now anxious to solve this problem (do you have a
     lot of 10 meg hard disks too?) and willing to work with me toward
     a solution?




     Fidonews                     Page 6                   24 Mar 1986





     2.  THE DOS 33 MEGABYTE LIMIT
     --  -------------------------

     2.1 Theory 1

     A friend of mine told me that a friend of his told him  that  the
     fix to PC-DOS to the 33Meg limit on Volume size is a 5 byte patch
     to DOS itself.

     Is this so?  Does someone have a copy of the patch?

     How  do  you  FORMAT a volume correctly once you have applied the
     patch?

     I don't want to pay $$$ for a five byte patch  (typical  for  the
     commercial version of this thing) if that's all it really is.  On
     the  other hand,  if it's not a simple patch,  and the commercial
     version comes with programs that do all the formatting - and  let
     me  select  the  cluster  size and fat entry size (12 or 16 bits)
     then maybe it's worth it.

     Does anyone have any  experience  with  any  of  these  programs,
     Especially  the  "VFeature"  from  Golden Bow in San Diego?  Will
     Emerald sell their software without a subsystem?

     2.2 Theory 2

     Another source tells me that the problem is not with  DOS,  since
     there  is  no  theoretical  limit to the size of a hard disk (the
     clusters just keep getting bigger) the problem is  with  the  DOS
     Format  program,  which  is  not clever enough to deal with truly
     moby drives.

     To wit:  In DOS 2, with 12 bit FATs, and 4096 byte clusters,  the
     theoretical limit for disk size was (2^12 - 16) * 4096 bytes,  or
     around 16 Meg,  and with 8K clusters it's around 33 MEG.  If  you
     were  willing to WASTE space in the extreme,  a 16K cluster could
     buy you a 66 MEG volume - but FORMAT can't deal with it.

     In  DOS  3,  with  16  bit  FATs,  and  2048  byte  clusters  the
     theoretical  limit  for  disk size is (2^16 - 16) * 2048,  or 134
     MEG,  which is a more reasonable limit.  Bigger clusters buy  you
     more, of course.

     Is  it  possible to simply modify the parameter table in the boot
     sector in the hard disk,  and initialize the  FAT  and  directory
     sectors myself?  I have written a program that initializes, reads
     and  writes  MSDOS  volumes  for/on UNIX systems - it is not that
     hard to initialize a DOS volume.

     In other words,  Is the "fix" not actually a patch to DOS,  but a
     procedure that can be followed manually by any technically expert
     Wizard?

     3.  DISK CACHING PROGRAMS FOR IBM-PC
     --  --------------------------------

     There's  now  quite  a few Disk Caching/Disk Speedup programs for
     the IBM PC commercially available:

     VCache - Golden Bow Systems
         Uses Extended or Expanded memory for up to 16M of disk cache!
         $65

     Lightning - Personal Computer Support Group
         Claims to speed up disk  access  by  factor  of  2  $49  copy
         protected, $89 not protected

     Flash - Software Masters
         Claims to speed up disk access by factor of 4 $49

     Disk Optimizer - SoftLogic Solutions
         Claims  to  move  things  around on the hard disk so that all
         files reside in contiguous clusters.  Doing a backup,  format
         and  a  restore  only gets the files contiguous,  but not the
         directory clusters  (in  fact,  it  gives  almost  worst-case
         allocation   for  directories,   which  are  where  you  want
         contiguous the most!). $49

     Does anyone have any experience with any of these  programs?  Are
     there freeware products that are as good or better?


     4.  USING QUANTUM 2000 HARD DISK WITH ST506 CONTROLLER
     --  --------------------------------------------------

     So,  I  have a Quantum 2040 and two Quantum 2080 hard disk drives
     lingering about here.  It would please me greatly to hook them up
     to anything I have handy -that probably means  either  an  IBM-PC
     (preferred)  or  an  S-100  machine  (probably a Seattle Computer
     Products,  runs  MS-DOS).   Problem  is,  nobody  seems  to  make
     controllers  for SA1000 type hard disk drives anymore.  The ST506
     interface took over the market.


     I am told that I can use an ST506 controller - Thusly:

     signal name         34 pin conn.             50 pin conn
     *RWC                    2                        2
     *Head Sel 2             4                        4

     (the notation *signal means the same as signal,  but overbars are
     hard to do)

     And  furthermore,  I can accomplish this by simply jumpering near
     the connector on the 20xx as follows:  6-40, 10-42, 12-44,  24-36
     and  just  running 34 conductor cable all the way to the 20xx and
     terminating with a 50 pin connector (heh,  heh) on the low  order
     side of the cable.

     Has anyone tried this?  Does it actually work?


     Thanks in advance,
     Barry Dobyns, 102/115

                 How to set-up a Multiuser system on a PC
                               for under 50$


          I am sure that most of you are at  least  slightly  familiar
     with the idea of a multiuser and/or multitasking system and would
     all like to have a machine that did both, right on your desk top.
     Well for $49.95 you can have one or the other as you desire.

          The   program  that  you  need  is  DoubleDOS  by  SoftLogic
     Solutions  and  it  can  be  had  for  under  $50  from   various
     distributors  and  I  believe  from SoftLogic at 530 Chestnut St.
     Manchester,  NH 03101 or 1-800-272-9900 (call them before sending
     money).

          What  DoubleDOS does is partition your ROM into two separate
     areas (top and bottom sections) of various sizes that you can set
     from 48k to your maximum memory.  DoubleDOS takes less than  50K.
     A minimum system configuration of 192K is recommended.

          DoubleDOS  is  a multitasking program that allows you to run
     two programs at once and switch between the two with the tap of a
     key.  There are two tasks,  the visible and the invisible  tasks.
     The  visible  one is the one on your screen and the invisible one
     is the one running in the background.  Obviously  only  one  task
     can  be  visible  at  any time and direct screen writing programs
     must be run in the "top"  section.  The  way  to  make  DoubleDOS
     multitasking is easy.  First switch the background task and start
     a program, then switch to the foreground task and start a program
     there,  viola!  Both  programs  are  running.  (Note:  Check  the
     DoubleDOS manual for automatic program starting with DoubleDOS.)

          What I had originally obtained a copy of DoubleDOS  for  was
     to make 107/33 a 24hrs.  a day BBS.  I'm sure a lot of sysops can
     sympathize with me in that their departments use the PC and  DECs
     during  the  day for useless tasks like Accounts Payable and word
     processing,  and not until  everyone  goes  home  does  the  real
     purpose for computers come to life,  Fido and FidoNet!  Well with
     DoubleDOS I thought that I would be  able  to  keep  the  BBS  up
     24hrs.  and I was.  Well, almost.  First off, version 11q of Fido
     seemed to run fine and all was  well.  Then  11s  came  and  Fido
     would  not  run  in the top or bottom section of DoubleDOS.  When
     using 11q with DoubleDOS (I have DoubleDOS 3.1T  and  PC-DOS  3.1
     with  512k on an XT with a 20 meg Seagate) I had a bottom section
     with approximately 170K and Fido ran fine  with  that.  When  11s
     came  I  boosted  the memory in the bottom section all the way to
     300K+ and I still got a error that said  not  enough  memory  for
     program.  Now  this was not a DOS error message,  as Fido came up
     with its disclaimers and licensing  information,  then  gave  the
     message   and   aborted.   By   decreasing  the  space  that  the
     environment  used  I  finally  got  Fido  and  DoubleDOS  running
     together.  See  NODELIST.052  and  the file ENVIRON.FIX that came
     with it to decrease the size of the  environment.  Also  I  reset
     the  path  while  running  Fido,  as  Fido  does not need a path.
     Aborting Fido resets the PATH via the RUNBBS.BAT batch file  that
     I use to run Fido.

          Getting to run two programs on my BBS had me so happy that I
     thought  about  how  to  get  DoubleDOS to make my XT a multiuser
     system.  Well,  my experiment worked quite nicely and was  rather
     simple.  I used:

          1 - Televideo 950 Terminal
          1 - Null modem cable
          1 - DoubleDOS ver. 3.1T
          1 - Async board
          1 - PC/XT with 512K

          I  start  up DOS with no resident software,  and give a MODE
     command:

          MODE COM2:96,,,,P

          In the DoubleDOS configuration file, DDCONFIG.SYS, I set the
     following parameters:

          TOP = COM1
          BOTTOM = COM2
          BOTTOM PROGRAM = CTTY COM2

          Now  it  is  time  to  hook  up  the  terminal.  I  set  the
     Televideo 950 to 9600 baud by setting the appropriate switched in
     the back by the ON/OFF switch, or by hitting SHFT-SETUP and using
     the  arrows  to  move the cursor to the baud rate and then type T
     till the baud rate is 9600.  Now I connect the terminal  to  COM2
     using  the  null  modem cable.  I wired the null modem cable with
     the following connections:

                 1 ---- 1
                 2 ---- 3
            IBM  3 ---- 2    TV 950
                 4 ---- 5
                 5 ---- 4
                 6 ---- 20
                 7 ---- 7
                 8  nc  8
                20 ---- 6  *)

          When I run DoubleDOS the screen is in the top memory section
     and the bottom memory section prompt comes up on the terminal.

          There are some definite limitations to the programs that can
     be run like this.  Programs that write to the screen, like VEDIT,
     LOTUS,  BASIC,  BASIC and the like are some  such  programs.  But
     most  if  not  all  of  the DOS commands are now available to the
     second user (bottom section) as  well  as  the  first  user  (top
     section).  Version  11t  of Fido can also be run in test mode for
     BBS maintenance.

          I would really like to hear from other people who have tried
     this,  and hear what they have done with this.  Please direct all
     comments and inquires to David Melnik 107/33 for a prompt reply.

     Larry DiGioia, sysop Fido 129/17
     NEVERBOARD, 412-733-4842 - 24 hrs./300/1200/2400

        What do sysops do in their spare time? ("Ha!" you say, "Sysops
     DON'T HAVE any spare time!").  Well,  that's certainly true in  a
     way,  but  before  I  started running a Fido,  I spent most of my
     spare time enjoying the  latest  movies,  books,  TV  shows,  and
     occasionally  listening  to international broadcasts on shortwave
     radio.  As a matter of fact,  I consider myself a sort of amateur
     movie critic.  So,  when the opportunity to start a BBS presented
     itself,  what better theme to dedicate  it  to  than  the  above-
     mentioned subjects?

        NEVERBOARD is a BBS dedicated to "Entertainment of All Kinds".
     Like  many of you,  when I first started calling BBSs,  the first
     messages I entered were on the order of, "Does anyone know what I
     can do to get my modem  to  download  files"?  Then,  after  that
     particular  problem  was  solved,  and  I  had downloaded (what I
     thought was) my fill of games, graphics and other time wasters, I
     kind of said to myself, "What next"? I believe a BBS should serve
     some useful function,  or else  it  will  turn  into  the  typing
     equivalent  of  a  circle  of  grade school friends who have just
     discovered the telephone:  meaningless remarks about things  that
     no one else is interested in, better to be kept private.

        I see Fido as an important resource that allows people to meet
     and exchange important information that they would otherwise have
     no  way of finding,  at least not in such a timely way.  When you
     see a movie or TV show, or read a book, call NEVERBOARD and leave
     a message about how you liked  it.  You  will  be  performing  an
     important  service:  helping to promote interest in a work of art
     that other people might otherwise not hear about through unbiased
     observation.  Or you might have the satisfaction of knowing  that
     after  they read your comments,  others won't have to waste $9.95
     on the latest record from a current "Supergroup".

        We have our technical side, too.  The tech and shortwave radio
     section is a place where you can find hints and help if you would
     like  to get involved in this fascinating hobby.  I would like to
     start a regular mail route for passing on the latest  information
     on stations heard, program schedules, etc. I have just added a 30
     meg.  drive  to  help distribute the growing amount of truly high
     quality public domain software that is making the rounds. We also
     have  informational  files  on  shortwave  listening  and   local
     broadcast schedules.  Just remember: the next time you would like
     to  share  your  latest discovery of a good book,  movie,  video-
     cassette  or  anything  that  qualifies  as  entertainment,  CALL
     NEVERBOARD!  If you would like to mail in a review or comment,  I
     will be happy to convert/transfer it to the appropriate  area  of
     the board.

                                  SHUTTLE


     And so they came to the Melting Pot,
     All the races of the world,
     Some with a will and some against their will.
     They found that the earth beneath their feet
     Any dream they chose.


     They chose as their greatest dream
     Traveling among the stars.
     They studied and learned and
     Took from the Earth what they needed to
     Build their slim dream machines, and they practiced
     With their machines and sometimes faltered, for no thing made of
     Atoms, be it man or man-made, can be perfect.


     But they practiced, and one such practice they held on a
     Clear, cool, Tuesday morning in January. After some delays, but
     Still as a routine mission, they sent another dream aloft.


     Then, high enough and far enough away so no one else was hurt,
     But close enought so the cameras could see,
     This piece of the Dream.
     Spread itself beautifully and violently
     Across the sky, deceiving those watching, for a moment,
     Into thinking that all was well.
     Zues might have worked like this when he placed
     Orion of Gemini or the Pleides in the Skies.


     The Pleides (the Seven Sisters),
     Cluster close together high in the winter sky.
     Tuesday's constellation has seven stars,
     But must go by a different name
     For five were brothers, and two were sisters;
     These seven came from all the races of the world,
     And one of the sisters was a teacher of children,
     A gentle hand, a loving hand, who said,
     "I take a piece of each of you with me."
     She spoke to her children in her home stae, and to us all,
     Because we all identify so strongly with school,
     With those teachers we valued,
     And with our years of education,
     Which built, among other things, this Dream.


     In a sense, the terrible trails of the falling debris
     Were changed by having the teacher aboard.
     We are used to thinking of hardened engineers trained in
     Cold numbers; this would have been just another cold accident.
     The teacher added a gentleness, a warnth; making the pieces of
     Debris more like petals she was giving back to us.

     This tiny emmissary of the human species crossed the barrier from
     Life into Death to be part of a Larger Universe;
     They remind us of the part of a Larger Universe,
     Of which we are all a part, even as we breathe,
     Plays in all our Dreams.

     Al  de la Torre
     FIDO 135/7

                            In Every Cloud.....

          I hate to see  the  unfortunate  experience  of  one  person
     tarnish the reputation of an otherwise outstanding company.  From
     my perspective and firsthand experience, SoftLogic Solutions is a
     model company.  When I first learned about DoubleDOS (over a year
     ago)  it was selling for $99.  At that time,  and for that price,
     if it worked I felt it was a fair value for my money.  I knew  it
     might  not  work  because  I  was  using a Compaq Deskpro running
     Compaq's version  of  MS-DOS,  not  PC-DOS.  But  then,  as  now,
     SoftLogic had a 30 day return policy, so I went ahead and ordered
     it.

          When the package arrived, I was unable to get it to run FIDO
     in  the  background  so I called their tech support.  The friend-
     liness and earnest attempts to solve the problem really impressed
     me.  Unfortunately the program could not  be  made  to  work  and
     after  working  on  it a couple hours with tech support for a few
     days in a row, I gave up and returned the product for a refund.

          A few months later two things happened.  I heard of  a  FIDO
     running  under  Double  Dos and SoftLogic came out with a special
     deal to purchase two programs:  DoubleDOS and Disk Optimizer  for
     $89.  Due to my favorable experience with the company in the past
     I  immediately  called and placed an order.  This time everything
     worked like a champ.  I've been running 135/7 for a long time now
     with this great product and it is now an  indispensable  function
     to be able to do maintenance on the BBS without bringing it down.

          I  feel  the  company  is making great effort to accommodate
     users.  Reducing the price is something that really impresses me.
     When was the last time Multilink got cheaper?

          On the point in  Neal's  article  concerning  the  BBS.  All
     right,  so  the  sysop  forgot to install the new password he was
     given.  At least  they  have  a  BBS.  If  they  were  like  most
     companies  you  would  have  to  send back your original disk and
     waited until they sent you a new one.  This would take far longer
     than the 4 days you attempted to get through.  Also  I'm  curious
     as  to  why  you didn't call their voice number the day after the
     first  password  failed.  The  password  changes  daily,  and  it
     should.  They  are  placing  a  valuable  product in a precarious
     position.

          I talked to tech support yesterday  (3-6-86)  and  was  told
     they  are  putting  in  extra phone lines and adding more support
     personnel.  I  encourage  other  users  of  Double  Dos  to  call
     SoftLogic  (603) 644-5555  and  say  they want the BBS up 24 hrs.
     Also suggesting they place one person in charge of sysop  respon-
     sibilities might be a good idea.

                           Announcing a new FIDO
                                Fido 107/601
                               (215) 367-6558
                                   SYSOPS
                            Annette Sine-Weilnau
                               Peter Weilnau

     There is a new FIDO on the East  Coast!  It's  free,  public  and
     already  has  a good assortment of PC and MacIntosh public domain
     software.  So far it's only 20 meg and 1200 baud,  but  the  2400
     will  soon be here,  and we promise to add more storage when it's
     needed.

     What's the catch?  There is none, but, we do have a special theme
     for "Stone Wall".  We think that computer technology can be  used
     to help fight some of mankind's basic problems.  So,  we chose to
     help with the hunger problem.  Now,  you might ask  "How  in  the
     world  can  a  BBS  help  fight the hunger problem?" We have some
     ideas that we're going to try,  and with your help,  we  hope  to
     find a lot more ideas in the future.

     Initially,  The  Stone  Wall  BBS  will  carry  information about
     individuals and  small  organizations  that  have  come  up  with
     noteworthy  ideas and methods to help fight hunger.  But we we're
     sure there are many more things a BBS can do to help  with  these
     tough  problems.  So,  if  you  have any ideas how computer tech-
     nology can help,  please share them with us,  after  all,  that's
     what we're here for!

     We  think that by carrying extensive public domain libraries,  we
     can attract more people - which in turn helps to spread ideas and
     increase our effectiveness.  So any  software  contributions  you
     can  make,  will  make  a  big difference.  See how easy it is to
     help!

     We hope that our  public  service  orientation  will  help  bring
     credibility to the BBSing community.  After all,  we sure do need
     some good press.  And your support will contribute to maintaining
     the freedom that Bulletin Boards enjoy today.

                             Notes from Abroad

                    Modems, BELL, and the CCITT standard


     As distributors of both hardware and software in Scandinavia,  my
     company  has  put  great  effort  in  finding  modems  to fit our
     European  standard,   CCITT.   We've  sent  telexes  and   called
     virtually  every manufacturer of Modems (Hayes compatible) in the
     USA.   Here  are  the  compiled  results,   after  squeezing  the
     technical support staff of every vendor we've been in touch with:

     HAYES
         Hayes  is  heavily emphasizing their new 2400 bps modem being
         fully compatible with the European CCITT  standard.  This  is
         true,  because  the  V22.bis  (2400/2400  baud)  standard  is
         exactly the same  in  both  the  USA  and  Europe.  The  only
         problem  (which  they  incidentally  forget to mention) being
         that  the  lower  baud  rates  are  only  available  in  BELL
         standard.

         This  means  that  the  money spent on a Hayes modem (approx.
         $750.00 US,  freight included),  is a waste.  It can only  be
         used for connecting to the US time slot,  and will have to be
         specially set up and plugged in for the time the time slot is
         active.

         Also, they are currently working on setting up their European
         distributor network, and will not or cannot ship overseas.

     U.S. ROBOTICS
         Same as for Hayes, only CCITT compatible at V22.bis.

     VEN-TEL
         I had my hopes high when I was connected to the tech  support
         people after talking to the sales department: I was told that
         their modem was CCITT compatible also below 2400/2400.  After
         3  phone  calls and 2 telexes,  I finally got the news:  It's
         only compatible on V22 and V22.bis, not V21 (300/300), due to
         the internal structure of their LSI-chip.  Also they do  have
         another modem that's cheaper,  without the V22.bis,  but that
         couldn't take V21 either.

         I tried to explain our situation to them,  and  was  promised
         that  V21  would be implemented in their next revision of the
         chip.  That's so far, we'll have to see.

     QUBIE
         QUBIE has been known to take odd ways  when  designing  their
         products, and I wasn't let down:

         QUBIE  will  shortly  release  a  100% Hayes compatible modem
         featuring  CCITT  standards  V21  and  V22.   V22.bis   isn't
         included, but might be sometime in the near future.


     Fidonews                     Page 17                  24 Mar 1986





     The  rest  of  the  list  isn't  really too interesting,  just to
     mention RACAL-VADIC's modems; they aren't on CCITT either...

     It seems like the US vendors have been blind when designing their
     modems,  not realizing the enormous market in Europe  for  CCITT.
     The  fact  is  that  the  difference between CCITT and BELL is so
     little that a new ROM for some of the modems,  and a little  more
     effort  in  the  LSI-chips  for  others,  wouldn't be too much to
     expect.

     As far as I know there are  no  European  manufacturer  that  can
     offer modems that are true Hayes-compatible;  Accepting the  "AT"
     command set, and autoswitching between baud-rates.  The Norwegian
     TeleCom have been talking about the issue for some time now,  but
     they won't release it for at least another year,  if  my  sources
     are correct.

              Now available from Micro Consulting Associates!!

     Public Domain collection - 300+  "ARC"  archives  -  10  megs  of
     software  and  other  goodies,  and that's "archived" size!  When
     unpacked,  you get approximately 17 megabytes worth of all  kinds
     of  software,  from text editors to games to unprotection schemes
     to communications programs, compilers, interpreters, etc...

     This collection is the result of more than 10 months of intensive
     downloads from just about 100 or more BBS's  and  other  sources,
     all  of  which have been examined,  indexed and archived for your
     convenience.  Starting a Bulletin Board System?  Want to  add  on
     to your software base without spending thousands of dollars? This
     is the answer!!!

     To  order  the  library,  send  $100  (personal or company check,
     postal money order or company purchase order) to:

                    Micro Consulting Associates, Fido 103/511
                    Post Office Box 4296
                    200-1/2 E. Balboa Boulevard

     Please allow 3 weeks for delivery of your order.

     Note:  No profit is made from  the  sale  of  the  Public  Domain
     software  in  this  collection.  The price is applied entirely to
     the cost of  downloading  the  software  over  the  phone  lines,
     running  a  BBS  to  receive  file  submissions,  and inspecting,
     cataloguing, archiving and maintaining the files.  Obtaining this
     software  yourself  through  the  use  of a computer with a modem
     using commercial phone access would cost you much more than  what
     we charge for the service...

     Please specify what type of format you would like the disks to be
     prepared on.  The following choices are available:

             IBM PC-DOS Backup utility

             DSBackup
             Fastback
             Plain  ol' files (add $50,  though,  it's a lot  of
             work and takes more diskettes...)

     Add  $30  if  you  want  the  library  on  1.2 meg AT disks (more
     expensive disks).  There are no  shipping  or  handling  charges.
     California residents add 6% tax.

     For each sale, $10 will go to the FidoNet Administrators.
