                            DATELINE: EUROPE


     Well, EuroCon II is now over and everyone here feels that it has
     been an unqualified success.  I'm sure many join me in my
     personal thanks to the Dutch and the Holland Computer Club for
     all their efforts and hospitality.

     My understanding is that the news of the conference will be
     reported on in full by one of the Dutch Sysops, so I will just
     provide a few of my personal impressions.

     First of all, I was very impressed with the spirit of cooperation
     shown by the approximately 150 Sysops who attended the convention
     from a dozen countries.  Europeans have come to face many of the
     same issues that confront us in North America, although their
     situation is compounded by, not only the long distance from the
     U.S., but also a combination of national influences, including
     the imposition by the various PTTs (national telephone
     monopolies) of various concerns which have made BBSing a far more
     expensive proposition for the typical individual.

     Meetings and discussions were held on Regional and international
     levels which led to the agreement that the various Regions
     (nations) will return to their countries to begin the process of
     creating such local organizations as seems reasonable in each
     instance, along with joining together in an international
     organization that can represent the interests of the entire area.
     The latter is especially needed to try to get the local PTTs to
     develop consistent regulations across borders and to prepare for
     the future integration of Europe telecommunications under the
     coming political and economic unification.

     One of the areas that I personally learned much more about was
     the special problems faced by the deaf and the various needs
     which they have toward better communications.  As an example, the
     use of simpler words and abbreviations is necessary in menus
     because the typical reading level of the deaf may only be
     equivalent to a ten year old.  Expressing their wish to be
     involved themselves, one of them, sysop David Jackson of England,
     challenged the developers and sysops present (and throughout
     FidoNet) to work with the deaf to create the necessary interfaces
     to meet their needs.  A show of hands indicated a strong
     willingness on the part of the sysops in attendance to
     participate in support for the deaf and the blind (at least one
     blind sysop attended the conference).

     FidoNews 5-31                Page 2                    1 Aug 1988


     Also attending the conference were representatives of HANDYNET,
     an ECC-supported Network dedicated to support of the disabled,
     and the European Space Agency who provide them with Network
     resources.  Future developments between them and FidoNet are
     awaiting the official creation of the European FidoNet
     organization.

     Although we indicated that the Europeans' primary concern, due to
     the various problems and lack of resources we presently face in
     North America, is that they concentrate on organizing and solving
     their own problems in Europe, many nonetheless requested to join
     IFNA as an expression of their desire to support FidoNet on a
     truly international basis.  My thanks to all who joined and also
     to those who expressed their support on other levels.

     Other areas which we have been tasked to follow through on back
     in North America are the legal use of the names "Fido" and
     "FidoNet" by the various organizations here, the rights of the
     countries to translate FidoNews (and other material) into local
     languages, and, most challenging of all, the revamping of the
     current structures of IFNA to provide greater represention and
     support (on a per capita basis) for the international groups.

     Lee Kemp, Communet 1:221/162.14

     16 June 1988

     C O P I N G   W I T H   R A P I D   G R O W T H   Part 2

     Last week I promised technical details of an alternative method
     for administering the nodelist that would overcome the problem of
     excessive size while maintaining a "fully coupled" network,
     through automatic updates directly between nodes via NetMail and
     EchoMail.

     Actually, I'll get back to the technical details next week. This
     week I'll present some background information on why its
     essential to decentralize and automate the nodelist to prevent
     its abuse by *Cs.

     Today is the first anniversary of Communet's original appeal
     against having our incoming NetMail killed by our net host, who
     was also the Australian Regional Coordinator of FidoNet, because
     he did not like the "Political Overtones" of files in our
     internal file areas. This occurred about 2 weeks after we joined
     FidoNet.

     That appeal resulted in our being removed from the Australian
     Region nodelist a couple of weeks later, instead of being allowed
     to pickup incoming NetMail. In the 12 months since, NOTHING has
     been done about that, by either the Zone or International
     Coordinators, despite appeals through all the proper channels.

     Our experience shows that the existing administration of FidoNet
     will tolerate ANY abuse of power over nodelist entries, no matter
     how flagrant. Whether this is due to ignorance, stupidity,
     overwork or paralysis from constant petty disputes, the fact is
     that IFNA is incapable of administering FidoNet as it is supposed
     to be administered according to POLICY3. Its important for other
     SysOps to know that when considering future structures.

     After successive polite efforts by Ross Lazarus, Peter Green and
     Darce Cassidy, I am the one stuck with the correspondence now and
     have gained a reputation for "belligerence" as a result. I'm not
     prepared to waste my time on further private correspondence or
     discussions in the IFNA or POLICY4 echos. I think that after 12
     months, its now time to start telling all SysOps all about it.

     Here's Peter Green's attempt to persuade the Australian Regional
     Coordinator to implement POLICY3, and the Australian Regional
     Coordinator's response. Over the next few week's I'll be
     publishing details of how the Zone and International Coordinators
     dealt with the problem.

     I hope that software developers and SysOps will think about the
     implications of this carefully when designing future structures
     for nodelist administration.

     I also hope that Tom Jennings will think about it carefully when
     FidoNews 5-31                Page 4                    1 Aug 1988


     deciding what to do with IFNA's licence to use the "FidoNet"
     trademark. The "FidoNet" trademark is NOT currently being used in
     Australia for the purposes intended - a public amateur Email
     network for the free exchange of information. BLATANT political
     criteria are being imposed for a nodelisting and that has been
     accepted at the highest levels.

     To: John Blackett-Smith

     Tuesday 16 June, 1987

     I understand you are now the FidoNet Coordinator for Region 50.

     As President of Communet I have taken over from Ross Lazarus as
     Sysop in charge of relations with FidoNet and am writing to
     formally appeal against our exclusion from FidoNet.  Attached for
     your background information is an article we had prepared to send
     to other boards introducing ourselves. {See "Hello from Communet"
     in part 1, last week. - Lee}

     Message #78  (CRASH)  (PRIVATE)
     Date: Fri 12 Jun 87 21:02
     From: Daryl Clayton on 50/0, Coordinator of AUSTRALIA
     To: Sysop(s) on 631/326, Communet of VIC OPUS NET,
     Subj: Communet

     To All sysops in communet:

     Hello all, tonite I logged onto Communet for the first & last
     time..

     Also I have stopped the scanning and passage of mail to and from
     your board for a number of reasons being.

     A) The Political Overtones in the News Contributions (File area
     2)

     B) The Statement concerning the charging for Aust wide mail
     (assumed to be fido-net mail as you are a fido node.)

     C) The asking for Money for Access & Other sevices on the bbs
     which contravenes the whole concept of OPUS (read the manual for
     more).

     D) Also you are taking a fair share of Echomail that is not
     available to Users but is listed as a later development, I do not
     intend to waste my time and money proccessing a substantial
     FidoNews 5-31                Page 5                    1 Aug 1988


     ammount of mail for 2 or 3 Sysops ONLY..

     Daryl Clayton. Region 50 Co-Ordinator & Net 631 Host..

     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

     Our response to these reasons is:

     A) We examined our verbose Opus logs to determine which files
     from our file area 2 Daryl had looked at so we could see what he
     meant by "Political Overtones". During the 10 minute call no
     files were either displayed or downloaded.

     B) and C) We have not charged any users for anything and do not
     intend to charge for FidoNet mail or for access. We will be
     charging only for actual costs of services like typesetting
     uploaded files.

     D) We do not give access to Echomail areas to twits on their
     first call. When new users are validated we upgrade their status
     from twit and give them access. As Daryl's call was his "first &
     last", we were unable to upgrade his status from twit.

     Ross Lazarus was unable to establish voice contact with Daryl
     over the weekend but informed me yesterday evening that he has
     done so and that Daryl no longer believes reasons B), C) or D)
     are grounds for excluding us from Fidonet.

     But we are still excluded for reason A) and that is the SOLE
     reason. We have now been told that the "Political Overtones"
     referred to in file area 2 were the EXISTENCE of draft papers for
     an election campaign, in files named DONTVOTE.TXT and DONTVOTE.2
     and that we cannot remain a node of FidoNet if such files appear
     on our board. In the opinion of a friend of Daryl's who works for
     the Electoral Office, they could be illegal, and our association
     with FidoNet could therefore be damaging.

     A natural response for any newcomer to FidoNet, on being treated
     like that, would be to just not bother further. Most people would
     not be interested in going through the appeals procedures of an
     organization whose regional coordinator for Australia could
     behave in this way. They would simply not want to be in it.

     For our part, we seriously considered just not bothering. We
     could just setup our own Email network for community groups
     without any hassles. However we have been in FidoNet long enough
     to know that there are a lot of friendly and helpful people out
     there, who do not operate in this way, and that it is an
     extremely valuable international effort that ought to be
     supported and not allowed to degenerate.

     We are determined to ensure that no other nodes are lost to
     FidoNet in Australia from this kind of behaviour.

     We run a very tightly controlled board and will not be permitting
     users to upload anything illegal. We do not require advice from
     FidoNews 5-31                Page 6                    1 Aug 1988


     any other Sysops in implementing that policy, even if they take
     the trouble to read the material they think they might object
     to.

     We are fully aware that FidoNet coordinators put a lot of time
     and effort into the job, while we as a new node have not yet
     contributed anything. We have no wish to buy into a fight with
     anybody about anything. But we doubt that any newspaper, or any
     bulletin board in Australia would even CONSIDER submitting
     material with "Political Overtones" for inspection by some
     outside authority before publication.

     Even apart from internal file areas, the latest official US
     Echomail list (102) shows several Echomail conferences with
     "Political Overtones". If US Sysops can run Echomail conferences
     on subjects from Feminism to Politics to Sado-Masochism without
     this being considered damaging to FidoNet, we cannot see how
     anybody could object to discussions internal to our board
     concerning alternative voting options during an election
     campaign.

     Discussions with "Political Overtones" only require official
     approval in certain countries in places like Eastern Europe and
     Latin America, that have political systems very different from
     Australia's.

     According to the FidoNet Policy and Procedures Guide "each Sysop
     formulates his own policy for running his board and dealing with
     his users" (p2) and "can pretty much do as he pleases, as long as
     he observes the mail events, is not excessively annoying to other
     nodes on FidoNet, and does not promote the distribution of
     pirated copyright software" (p3).

     Since we will not permit illegal material on our board we will
     not permit its transmission from our board through FidoNet
     either. But if we did do anything on FidoNet that excessively
     annoys others, it only needs to be explained to us what we are
     doing wrong for us to rectify the situation immediately.

     We have an urgent need to resume interrupted communications as we
     are a private node with an unpublished phone number and have
     already been apparently ignoring incoming messages for 4 days. We
     would appreciate it if you could act promptly to restore the
     proper functioning of net 631. But if this will cause any delays
     at all, it is essential that we not remain unreachable. In that
     case please act promptly as follows:

     A) Please list us for the time being as an independent node of
     Region 50 from the next nodelist. Whether in net 631 or as an
     independent, our listing should now read as follows: Name
     "Communet", Sysop, "Peter Green", Address "Melbourne AUSTRALIA",
     Phone "61-3-482-1718". We run Opus 0.0 under SEAdog 4.00 24
     hours, 7 days with a Netcomm 1234A modem so baud rate is 2400
     with flags for Continuous Mail, Extended Protocol and all CCITT
     V21, V22, V22bis, V23 and corresponding Bell standards both
     answer and originate mode.
     FidoNews 5-31                Page 7                    1 Aug 1988


     Also please inform us what polling arrangements we should make to
     pickup Fidonews and nodediffs etc each week.

     Although it is now necessary to publish our phone number in the
     nodelist, we are still a private board not ready for calls from
     the general public. As our number could become public knowledge
     through the nodelist, we are now restricting access to
     pre-registered users until we are ready to go public. This may
     also help to avoid unduly alarming Daryl's friend at the
     electoral office.

     B) Please assist us to arrange an alternative Echomail feed, if
     necessary, either from your board or by suggesting who we should
     approach. We will poll for pickup to pay the direct cost
     ourselves and would of course be happy to contribute our share
     towards any other costs. As we were in the middle of several
     technical discussions with US and other nodes when suddenly cut
     off, this is very urgent and it is important for us to catch up
     on any messages that have been missed, by scanning out all items
     since last Wednesday or Thursday. A copy of our areas.bbs file is
     attached.

     C) Please ask Daryl to at least permit us to pickup our incoming
     mail until the nodelist is changed, including any outstanding
     items that can be recovered.

     According to the FidoNet Policy and Procedures Guide, FidoNet has
     a philosophy for resolving disputes based on two simple rules:

     1) Thou shalt not excessively annoy others.

     2) Thou shalt not be too easily annoyed.

     Any network host, even if it happens to be a regional
     coordinator, is obliged to allow nodes in their net to pickup
     incoming messages. Nodes can only be removed from a net by
     amending the international nodelist, not by refusing to implement
     it.

     Points A), B) and C) above represent all that can be done
     immediately to temporarily resolve the situation. Once we are
     back in communication we would then appreciate your assistance to
     help us join another local net as soon as possible, if that is
     necessary.

     However we hope it is not necessary. We do not believe the long
     term solution should be to require a node to become independent
     or form its own net or even join another net because of a dispute
     like this.

     That would have serious consequences for the whole nature of
     Fidonet, at least in Australia. It would lead to networks being
     based on approval of each others' internal operations instead of
     being components of an international public amateur Email network
     to facilitate communications.

     FidoNews 5-31                Page 8                    1 Aug 1988


     We anticipate being in a position to act as a host ourselves
     before long and will be assisting a number of other community
     groups to establish nodes, especially public radio stations
     around Australia. We believe that networks should be organized on
     a purely technical basis for the most efficient flow of message
     traffic. It would be quite wrong for us to refuse to host a board
     that we did not agree with, or one that was not interested in the
     same topics as others in our net, but had no other convenient
     link to national Echomail traffic etc.

     Agreement about "Political Overtones" is not necessary for the
     technical coordination of Email traffic. The International
     Telecommunications Union and Universal Postal Union are
     reasonable examples of the possibility of even Governments with
     great hostility towards each other coordinating in the interests
     of communications efficiency.

     We found Daryl to be very friendly and helpful until he
     discovered that our users were discussing political topics (among
     many others incidentally). Once this incident is resolved, we
     would be perfectly happy to forget it ever occurred and rejoin
     Daryl's net.

     Yours sincerely,

                    Peter Green for Communet

     PS

     1) Though not easily annoyed, we are EXTREMELY annoyed that
     Daryl's action may have resulted in other nodes who rely on the
     published FidoNet nodelist thinking their replies to recent
     messages and Echomail from us have been ignored.

     We will forward copies of this message to other regional nodes to
     inform them that net 631 is violating the currently published
     nodelist by not forwarding inwards mail to 631/326.  They need to
     know that the only way that messages can reach Communet until the
     nodelist is amended is through crashmail or special direct
     routing. Since we have an unpublished phone number, any node
     wanting to correspond with us will need to recompile the current
     nodelist with the following line added to XLATLIST.CTL or
     equivalent:

     PHONE 631/326 61-3-482-1718

     Please note that you need to do this yourself to reply.

     To reduce costs, we would appreciate your assistance in
     forwarding copies of this message, and the accompanying article,
     through the AUST_SYSOP Echomail immediately - without of course
     implying your agreement to anything we have said. We are unable
     to use our normal Echomail route through 631/320 for obvious
     reasons, however we will of course forward a copy to Daryl
     directly to give him an opportunity to reconsider.

     2) We will also forward a copy of this to the international
     coordinator. That is not by way of appeal of course, but to
     introduce the following remarks in support of criticisms we have
     read in Fidonews, of proposals to separate FidoNet into
     independent zones.

     Our excommunication message was signed by the then Regional
     Coordinator for Australia as well as our network host. Though
     there are many regional coordinators to keep an eye on each other
     in zone 1, Australia is the major region in its zone. If each
     zone was independent with no responsibility to an international
     coordinator, that message could easily have been signed by the
     same person as "Zone coordinator and network host". What could a
     node do if it received a message like that?

     Lets have one set of policy and procedures for the whole network,
     so it remains one network.

     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

     The response to that polite and reasonable message from Peter
     Green was an attempt to pretend we had lost any right to appeal,
     followed by a string of abuse and threats from John
     Blackett-Smith, culminating in a formal decision upholding our
     excommunication for "Political Overtones":

     Peter, Ireceived your standard verbose message a few minutes ago
     and wish to advised as follows:

     I am prepared to consider your case in the light of Policy 3 and
     after discussing the matter with Daryl Clayton.

     I am most unhappy with your attempts to pressure me into a
     decision on your terms by threatening to circulate the two
     messages you sent to me to all Regions. I am adamant that this is
     a Region 50 matter and the messages should have been treated as
     such and placed in the RG50_SYSOP conference.

     If the messages have gone out as you threatened, then you leave
     me no alternative but to accept that the matter has gone beyond
     Region 50 and that it now becomes the province of the Zone
     Co-Ordinator or even the International Co-Ordinator. In that case
     you may feel free to appeal to either. As you are so keen to
     quote Policy 3 when it suits your case (and to decry it when it
     doesn't) another read of that will give you a good idea of what
     the attitudes will be when it is discovered you are not following
     the normal appeal protocols.

     {Peter's message merely ASKED John to place our message in
     AUST_SYSOP so other nodes would be able to bypass the net host
     that was killing our incoming NetMail. We foolishly went along
     with John's belligerent demands that we not publicize the
     situation while he made up his mind. John and Daryl took
     advantage of that to organize a smear campaign about us being a
     "nest" of "commies" while we were cut off from EchoMail and
     incoming NetMail and therefore unable to reply. Nor have we ever
     been able to publicly reply since, until now in FidoNews, as
     EchoMail in zone 3 is censored - Lee}

     As Daryl is/was your Net Co-Ordinator, he is at liberty to make
     that decision, providing it is done so on reasonablew grounds.

     As with many of your messages, Lee, you demonstrate an incredible
     ignorance... an ignorance of FidoNet, Policy 3, the structure of
     the system. You appear to have a propensity to tell far more
     experienced and knowledgable people "how to suck their own eggs"
     and only succeed in demonstrating how much of a newcomer you are.
     I am responsible for forwarding the NODEDIFFs to the ZONEGATE who
     forwards them on to the International Co-Ordinator.

     [...]

     {Needless to say, John was then responsible for forwarding the
     Region 50 nodeLIST to the IC as I had stated in my incredible
     ignorance. He received nodeDIFFs FROM the IC via the zonegate
     despite his great experience and knowledge. John had in fact
     agreed to remove us from the nodelist AFTER we appealed to him
     about our NetMail being killed and BEFORE his final decision. I
     am confident however that he is quite good at sucking his own
     eggs. - Lee}

     Again.... more of your arrant, ignorant, nonsense. I will give
     you the benefit of the doubt and assume you can't be so stupid as
     to believe the above three lines. Without the nodes... no
     region!

     {Well I guess we WERE pretty stupid to believe what we read in
     POLICY3. The actual reality is that the IC will NOT intervene in
     any decision taken outside the USA no matter how absurd. He
     apparently believes that the SysOps of other zones have some
     mechanism that would allow them to remove an RC who censors any
     mail critical of him and excommunicates anybody that might want
     him replaced. - Lee}

     [...]

      > Please note that no messages sent to or from us

     Well, Lee, there you go again..... as a novice SysOp of a very
     new node, your effrontery in telling others what will happen
     astounds me.

     As your Regional Co-Ordinator I am telling you, that any
     discussions between you and I are to remain confidential until a
     resolution has been reached.

     {In view of our experiences of being silenced by a demand for
     confidentiality while the person making the demand organized a
     smear campaign, we have since adopted a policy of NEVER agreeing
     to confidentiality for any correspondence whatsoever. - Lee}

     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

     On 22 June 1987 John confirmed our excommunication from the
     Australian Region of FidoNet, giving the following reasons:

             3. A file list in Area #2 wherein two of
                the file names could lead the average person
                to believe that they were instructions on
                how to avoid voting in elections requiring
                compulsory voting and other file names and
                descriptions could easily be construed to
                be political in nature and to be promoting
                actions and/or responses and/or ideas
                beyond the acceptable limits of the normal
                political spectrum.

     He based his decision on:

                what I consider to be normal societal values of
     FidoNews 5-31                Page 12                   1 Aug 1988


                Australia in general and Melbourne in particular,...

     John also reported us to the telephone company, the Electoral
     Commission, his Solicitor and the Police. None of them have been
     in touch so we presume that our understanding of normal societal
     values of Australia is closer to the mark than John's.

     Unfortunately its equally clear that John's understanding of the
     realities of his position as Regional Coordinator responsible to
     nobody was accurate. We were never re-instated to the Australian
     Region and have since been excommunicated from FidoNet altogether
     for complaining about that through the appeals procedures set
     down in POLICY3.

                    Treasure Hunter's & Coin Collectors

         After searching high and low for a connection to an echo area
     called COINS, boy was I disappointed.  It is not an area for coin
     collectors  or  the like it is something totally  different.   An
     like  most things when I find that what I am looking for  is  not
     available I take it on myself to make one.   Effective 1 Aug 1988
     the  Echo Area TH_ING will be avaialbe for connection from 301/1.
     Anyone  interested  in  Coin  collecting,  Treasure  Hunting,  or
     Collection of any kind are welcome to join.   If your Sysop  does
     not  carry  the  area and you would like for him to leave  him  a
     message and he can contact me.

         The disappointment of not finding an area where collection of
     coins was being discussed left me a little out of sorts because I
     had been looking for almost 3 months and I was told by a reliable
     source  (  I thought) that the COINS echo  was  just  that.   The
     establishment of the New Echo  TH_ING,  which stands for Treasure
     Hunting  is  prompted  partly  in  fact I am  not  an  avid  coin
     collector  but  I have several hundered coins which  are  several
     years  older than a lot of us and I am interested in finding  out
     the value of these things.

         The  guidelines for the Echo Conference will be very  simple.
     It  will be used for the discussion of Collection of  Things,  no
     matter what they might be.   BaseBall Cards,  comics or so forth.
     An the location of possible buyers of said items,  or sellers  of
     said items.   I will act as the Echo Moderator, and the Echo will
     be   controlled   here  at  301/1.    If  the  echo  achieves   a
     participation  level  of  20 or more nodes I will  at  that  time
     consider placing it on the BACKBONE for better distribution.   No
     node  who connects to the echo my distribute it to  another  node
     without first ensuring the node does not route it to another node
     already  participating.    I  will  call  this  a  streight  line
     distribution system.  I will act as the center hub.

          I am sitting here awaiting the start of the month of August,
     so  if  there  are  any of you out there who  want  to  make  the
     connections  please do so and if you read a copy of this prior to
     the 1 Aug date you may ask your sysop to connect or if you are  a
     sysop just drop a line and I will add you.

     Proposed Wording (C):
     --------------------

     The following membership categories are established:

       a) Regular Member. To be eligible, an applicant: must be the
          system operator in good standing of a PUBLIC ACCESS node;
          must have paid any dues required; is entitled to one vote.

       b) Associate Member.  Any person who is not eligible to be a
          Regular Member, but who is interested in electronic
          communications, is eligible to be an Associate Member by

       f) Freeloader member: Any person who applies for membership and

          dues; is nevertheless entitled to one vote. No
          correspondence shall be mailed to freeloader members at
          IFNA's expense, but only where a self-addressed envelope
          with sufficient postage or International Reply Coupons is
     FidoNews 5-31                Page 27                   1 Aug 1988


          provided by the freeloader member. This applies to ballot
          papers sent by mail under articles 11 and 18 as well as to
          acknowledgment of membership, renewal notices and any other
          correspondence. NetMail from IFNA officers, BoD members and
          staff responding to NetMail from freeloader members may be
          held for pickup at the freeloader's expense.

     Note that this amendment requires the following minor changes to
     By-Laws 3 and 4, shown here for simplicity.

     Add to By-Law 3:

          Freeloader members shall be notified of renewal only by
          annual publication of their names and expiry dates in
          FidoNews. Such publication shall occur unless the freeloader
          member specifically requests otherwise by notice in writing
          posted to the Secretary.

     Add to article 4:

          Dues set for freeloader members shall always be zero and
          there shall be no additional charge for international
          freeloader members.

     Comments (C):
     ------------

     The purpose of these amendments is to allow ALL public access
     SysOps to have a vote in electing the body that administers
     FidoNet, whether they wish to support IFNA financially or not,
     and to separate that issue from other issues that have been
     unnecessarily linked to it in alternative sets of proposed
     amendments.

          Regular Member, but who is interested in electronic
          communications, is eligible to be an Associate Member by
          paying required dues.  Associate Members have all of the
          rights of a Regular Member.  The membership committee will
          establish a set of criteria to recognize significant
          contributions to IFNA.  Any person meeting these criteria is
          exempt from the dues requirement for the period established
          by the Membership Committee.

       c) Commercial Member.  Any entity using the IFNA NETWORK for
          the conduct of any business is eligible to be a Commercial

          Member by paying required dues.  Any Commercial Member also
          satisfying the requirements to be a Regular Member shall be
          entitled to vote.

       d) Honorary Member.  The Board of Directors may award Honorary
          Member status to any entity.  Honorary Members have all of
          the rights of a Regular Member except the right to vote.

       e) Life Member.  Any member may become a Life Member by paying
          the required dues.

     Comments (D):

     This amendment modifies the criteria for an individual to become
     a member of IFNA.  The germane points here are that anyone
     wishing to support IFNA may become a member.  It is not necessary
     to be an operator of a system to be a full voting member of IFNA.
     Dues are waived for those contributing significantly to IFNA.


     Proposed Wording (E):
     --------------------

     The following membership categories are established:

       a) Regular Member. To be eligible, an applicant: must be the
          system operator in good standing of a PUBLIC ACCESS node;
          must have paid any dues required; is entitled to one vote.

       b) At-Large Member. To be eligible, an applicant: must be the
          system operator in good standing of a PUBLIC ACCESS node;
          must have been listed in the IFNA NODELIST for 180 days
          prior to the ANNUAL MEETING of the membership;  is entitled
          to one vote for the election of the At-Large Members of the
          Board of Directors only.

       c) Associate Member.  Any person who is not eligible to be a
          Regular Member, but who is interested in electronic
          communications, is eligible to be an Associate Member by
          paying required dues.  Associate Members have all of the
          rights of a Regular Member except the right to vote.

       d) Commercial Member.  Any entity using the IFNA NETWORK for
          the conduct of any business is eligible to be a Commercial
          Member by paying required dues.  Any Commercial Member also
          satisfying the requirements to be a Regular Member shall be
          entitled to vote.

       e) Honorary Member.  The Board of Directors may award Honorary
          Member status to any entity.  Honorary Members have all of
          the rights of a Regular Member except the right to vote.

       f) Life Member.  Any member may become a Life Member by paying
          the required dues.

     Present Wording:
     ---------------

     2. Applications for membership shall be submitted to the
        Secretary.  In the case of any applicant whose character,
        reputation or conduct might make him an undesirable member,
        the Secretary shall refer the application to the Executive
        Committee for review; in all other cases, the Secretary shall
        have the authority to grant membership.

     3. The Secretary shall notify members of the expiration of their
        membership not less than thirty days prior to expiration.  In
        determining membership status, memberships renewed within
        thirty days of expiration shall be regarded as continuous.


     Proposed Wording (A):
     --------------------

     2. Applications for membership shall be submitted to the
        Membership Committee.  In the case of any applicant whose
        character, reputation or conduct might make him an undesirable
        member, the Membership Committee shall refer the application

        continuous.

     Comments (A):
     ------------

     The secretary does not now, nor has he ever been, involved in
     membership. The application goes to the Treasurer, who  notifies
     the Membership Services Committee, who sends out the  membership
     card.

     2. Applications for membership shall be submitted to the
        Secretary or the Secretary's designate.  In the case of any
        applicant whose character, reputation or conduct might make
        him an undesirable member, the Secretary or the Secretary's
        designate shall refer the application to the Executive
        Committee for review; in all other cases, the Secretary or the
        Secretary's designate shall have the authority to grant

     Comments (B):
     ------------

     These tasks are distributed because there is too much for the
     Secretary to handle alone.

     membership and to allow the membership to provide input when
     setting the fees and fee structure.

         name of any who may withdraw by written communication.  The

         order.  If there be but one eligible nominee, the Nominations
         and Elections Committee shall declare him elected without
         balloting by the membership.  If there be more than one
         eligible nominee, then at least 45 days prior to the ANNUAL

         member, and publish in FidoNews, a ballot listing the
         candidates for director.  The ballot shall contain a copy of
         the current voting rules.

     Proposed Wording:

         of any nominee who may be ineligible for election and the
         name of any nominee who may withdraw by verified

         one eligible nominee for a particular Divisional position the
         Nominations and Elections Committee shall declare that
         individual elected without balloting by the membership.  This
         will not apply to the positions of At-large Director.  The
         rules for a particular election may provide that write-in
         votes be acceptable for any position, except any position
         previously announced as uncontested.  However, in no instance
         shall an individual be elected who does not qualify under all

         later than the start of the ANNUAL MEETING.

         reach the Secretary or such receiver designated in the
         published rules not later than the start of the ANNUAL
         MEMBERSHIP MEETING or such earlier time as may be specified
         in the published rules for that election.  Said time must be
         at least 40 days from the date the ballots were sent to the
         membership.

     Comments:
     --------

     Forty days is reasonable for International Mail.  It is quite
     possible that due to various reasons such as extra convention
     days prior to the meeting itself, that mail ballots might reach
     the required address a few days after the Secretary has left for
     the meeting.  Specification of an earlier date is in order in
     such instances.

          Board of Directors or by any ten members over their
          signature and, subject to subsection b), shall, when so
          submitted, be placed before the next Annual or Special
          Meeting of the Members of IFNA.  Amendments to the By-Laws
          may be effected at any such meeting by majority vote of the
          membership casting Ballots as defined in subsection e).

       b) All proposed amendments must be received by the Secretary at
          least 60 days prior to the scheduled vote date in order to
          be included on the Ballot.  They will then be forwarded to
          the By-Laws committee for preparation for inclusion on the
          Ballot.

       c) The By-Laws Committee is responsible for any proposed
          amendments to the By-Laws.  To this end, all proposals must
          be forwarded by the Secretary to the By-Laws Committee for
          inclusion on the Ballot.  The Committee reserves the right
          to edit, combine, or expand the submissions provided that
          any changes made do not substantially change the original
          intent of the proposal.  In the event of conflicting
          suggestions, the proposed amendments may be presented on the
          Ballot in the form of a "multiple choice" where only one of
          the suggestions may be selected.

       d) All proposed amendments will be of the form "old wording" /
          "new wording" including By-Law reference numbers where
          applicable.  This is intended to clarify the changes
          proposed.

       f) A certified public accountant (or equivalent) will receive
          and collate all mail Ballots received prior to the Annual or
          Special Meeting, and will be responsible for the receipt,

          close of voting.  The certified public accountant will
          present and certify the results of the balloting.

          shall cast the deciding vote.

     Comments (A):
     ------------

     The purpose of this revision is to clarify the procedure to be

     ----------------

     ##. IFNA recognizes the need to expand the method by which
         Networks may join IFNA.  IFNA also recognizes that
         telecommunications is rapidly advancing, and different
         networks with different organizations, policies, and
         telecommunications mechanisms will arise.

         DEFINITIONS:

         ZONE:     An autonomous network which has joined IFNA.

         NODELIST: The set of documents which define a Network at the
                   ZONE level.

         Each Zone must file an agreement which defines the set of
         interactions it will allow IFNA to have with the Zone, this
         set of interactions must be acceptable to IFNA and defines
         the jurisdiction IFNA has over the Zone.

         Zones 1, 2, and 3 will operate under the current set of
         rules, regulations and policies of IFNA for a period not to
         exceed six (6) months from the adoption of this amendment, or
     FidoNews 5-31                Page 52                   1 Aug 1988


         until an agreement between IFNA and the Zone is reached which
         is agreeable to both, whichever comes sooner.  If the Zone
         and IFNA do not reach agreement within the allotted time, the
         Zone will be removed from the IFNA nodelist, but all IFNA
         members in the Zone will retain membership voting rights.

         A Zone applying for IFNA membership must meet the following
         criteria:

          i) Be an operational Network with over fifty (50) nodes.

         ii) Be a Network which is not operated for profit, and which
             allows public access as defined by IFNA.

        iii) Establish a grievance procedure within the Network for
             IFNA members to follow for resolving any grievances
             involving IFNA.

         iv) Present to IFNA a set of individuals from within the
             Network to fill the required IFNA organizational
             positions.  The method of selecting these individuals is
             determined by the Network.

          v) Have an existing Nodelist, Network Map or other set of
             documents which define the Network.  Deliver this
             document to the Vice-President of Technical Operations,
             and deliver updates periodically as agreed to by IFNA.
             This document will be referred to as the Nodelist.

             This Nodelist need not conform to the current nodelist
             format(s) in use by IFNA at the time of application (IFNA
             realizes that not all networks use the current format)
             but it must contain enough information to allow
             telecommunications between the Network and other Zones.
             The Vice-President Technical Operations will determine if
             the Nodelist is sufficient.

         vi) Establish an operational gateway for telecommunications
             between the Network and other IFNA Zones.

        vii) Agree to abide by the policies, procedures, rules and
             regulations of IFNA for all matters pertaining to IFNA.
             That is, actually be a Zone in IFNA while retaining all
             rights not in the agreement with IFNA.

         The Board of Directors will establish a "ZONE COMMITTEE" for
         including all changes to current operating procedures, and
         modifications to the current set of BY-LAWS, such as BY-LAW
         24 which defines the voting divisions, to accommodate this
         expansion of IFNA.

         The Vice-President Technical Operations, the chairman of the
         FidoNet Technical Standards committee, the current ZoneGate
         operator for Zones 1, 2 and 3, and four (4) additional
         members appointed by the Board of Directors will be the
         initial members of the ZONE COMMITTEE.  The ZONE COMMITTEE
     FidoNews 5-31                Page 53                   1 Aug 1988


         will have no more then three (3) months to prepare these
         changes.  Upon completion of the changes the Election
         committee will prepare ballots to be mailed to all IFNA
         members for voting on the changes.  The ballot will contain
         the full text of the changes and a single choice -- "accept
         or reject".

         If the vote of the IFNA membership is reject, then:

          i) Each Zone in the IFNA nodelist will revert to operation
             under "FidoNet policy 3" published by Tom Jennings, and
             IFNA will stop all operations involving the zones,
             regions, networks and nodes except for preparation and
             distribution of FidoNews, the Nodelist, and the Nodediff.

         ii) The duties of the Region Coordinators will be restricted
             to distribution of the Nodelist, Nodediff, and FidoNews
             and processing of updates to the nodelist. ALL updates
             from the individual networks will be accepted and
             processed.

        iii) The Network Coordinators will operate their Networks as
             they choose within the constraints of Policy 3.

         iv) Individual nodes will operate their nodes as they choose
             within the constraints of Policy 3.

     Comments:
     --------

     This amendment represents the agreement between Zones and IFNA.
     It limits the power of IFNA to the administration of the
     interactions of Zones (networks), while at the same time
     returning IFNA to a central position of acting as a distributor
     publisher of a set of Nodelists which are available to ALL Zones
     in IFNA.  It will likely result in a large amount of flames, but
     essentially it "pulls IFNA back" to the administrative role,
     leaving the operation and policies of the Network(s) to the
     Network(s).  It also allows for a large political structure which
     can supply a lot of service without getting into the Network
     itself.  This should surely please a large amount of people.

     Docket Number BLA-88-0032 (Grievance Committee)


     Present Wording:

     N/A


     Proposed Wording:
     ----------------

     ##. A Grievance Committee is hereby established.  Membership
         consists of one member (1) from each Zone in IFNA, and one
         member from the Board of Directors.  Each Zone member will
         serve for a term defined by that Zone, but not to exceed five
         (5) years.  The member from the Board of directors will have
         a term of 1 year, and will be elected by the Board of
         Directors.

         The Grievance Committee will hear and resolve all grievances
         involving IFNA and IFNA members within a Zone which have not
         been resolved within thirty (30) days to the satisfaction of
         the IFNA member.

         The Grievance Committee will resolve the grievance within 30
         days.  The resolution will be binding on the person filing
         the grievance and on the Zone.  Resolution will be based upon
         the then current articles of association of IFNA and the
         agreement between IFNA and the Zone.

     Comments:
     --------

     This amendment assumes that the methods of grievance resolution
     within a ZONE have been tried and has not been resolved in a
     manner satisfactory to the IFNA member.

     The rights of an IFNA member in this context are limited to
     matters involving IFNA.

     When the Zone joined IFNA it agreed to a set of rules and
     procedures.  Only those rules and procedures agreed to between
     the Zone and IFNA may be the basis of a grievance to IFNA.
