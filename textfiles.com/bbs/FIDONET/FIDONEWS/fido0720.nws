                     My Wife's New Couch

     "They also serve, who only stand and wait."

     Certainly this is true of the wives of FidoNet Sysops.  While
     some spouses endure the much fabled Wednesday night Poker game,
     the sports addicted couch potato, or antique automobile
     restoral, the wife of a FidoNet Sysop finds that she is sharing
     her husband with that most demanding of mistresses, The Bulletin
     Board System!

     Yes, the BBS sings her siren song to the Sysop.  Enticing,
     seducing, entreating him to spend more time at the task of
     attaining that ever elusive goal (that is more a state of mind
     than an actual state of being) which can be summed up in the
     words, "There!  I've finally gotten it the way I want it, now I
     don't have to do any more, it can run itself!"

     The wife of a FidoNet Sysop (ok, ok, EVERY Sysop, but I like to
     indulge myself in the small conceit that FidoNet Sysops are far
     more dedicated in their task, the creme de la creme if you
     will) finds that she must come to terms with one of life's
     simple truths:  No matter how much time, no matter how much
     money her husband spends on his Bulletin Board, it will NEVER be
     enough.  There will always be one more screen to create, a
     little more tweaking to do, another hard drive to buy, another
     (insert favorite BBS activity here).

     Picture the following, fellow Sysop, and tell me honestly this
     hasn't happened in your home:

     It's late at night and you are working on the board.  It may be
     a new utility you're trying to install, or perhaps catching up
     on your mail.  It doesn't really matter what you're doing, the
     point is you are INVOLVED!  The last thing you want at this
     point is to be interrupted or have to stop what you're doing.
     Your wife is on her way to bed (after spending the entire
     evening alone in front of the tube, after all, you've been
     busy) and she asks when you're coming to bed.  Granting that
     your brain registers the fact that someone has said something,
     you reply absently that you'll be to bed in a few minutes.  When
     you actually do get to bed you silently hope that your wife
     doesn't wake up to see you hitting the sack at 2:30 am - 3 hours
     after you last spoke to her.

     Sound familiar?

     How about this?

     Your powers of persuasion and creativity are pushed to the
     limit as you explain to your wife just exactly why you need to
     spend several hundred dollars for an HST modem, a VGA card &
     monitor, or any of the score of goodies that immediately come to
     mind.

     No, the conscientious Sysop does not have an easy life, but the
     wife of a Sysop has an even more difficult task.  She gives up
     time with her husband, abandoning him to an avocation which, in
     most cases, she understands very little and cares about even
     less.  Not easy to do, but done out of love.

     This is not to say that there are not women who share their
     husbands interest.  Au contraire!  As a matter of fact in Net
     205 there is one wife who has developed such an interest in the
     BBS hobby that she now runs the slickest and most popular board
     in the area and is the NEC to boot!  She has a real passion to
     make her BBS the very best it can be and you can see that care
     from the moment you log on (and our hats are off to ya, Sam!).

     My heartfelt thanks to the wives of the FidoNet Sysops, and to
     my own wife in particular, for putting up with this strange
     preoccupation which borders on obsession.  You smile bravely and
     encourage us in this expensive and time consuming hobby.  My own
     wife has never asked once why in the world I want to spend
     thousands of dollars and devote an endless amount of time to
     entertain total strangers.  No doubt she's wondered, but has
     never asked.  Without the support of our spouses in this odd
     and delightful hobby, the boards would be a far less interesting
     place to be.

     About the title:  My friend sits, admiring my new system.  I
     won't bore you with the details, but it is a superfine machine
     which anyone would be proud to own.  My friend turns to me and
     says, "This is a really nice setup!"

     My wife, in the dining room, is watching us.  Upon hearing my
     friend's comment she pulls on her mask of patient long-suffering
     and informs our guest, "That's my new couch."

     Lastword:  OK, before I'm flamed to death by the female Sysops
     out there let me say that I wrote this from a man's perspective
     and that's the way it is.  There are a lot of BBS's run by the
     fair sex and without exception I have found them to be first
     rate.  But tell me, if your husband, boyfriend or whatever does
     not share your interest, don't they sometimes resent the time
     you spend with your system?                I'm outta here.

     1) VISA :
     ---------
     There are no visa requirements for people coming from
     EEC-countries.

     Residents from non-EEC west European countries such as Norway,
     Sweden, Finland, Switzerland, etc ... do not require any
     special documents if they have a valid travel passport or
     appropriate ID.

     People coming from the former eastern bloc must apply for a
     visa at the Belgian embassy in the capital of the respective
     countries.

     FidoNews 7-20                Page 8                   14 May 1990


     To do so, we'll send an official invitation on letter-headed
     paper to all eastern European registrations which can then be
     used for your visa- application.

     The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has assured that the long
     waiting-lines are over and that the document can be obtained in
     a very short period, however we suggest you play it from the
     safe side.

     All other nationalities, please check with the Belgian embassy
     in your capital as soon as possible.

     2) CURRENCY :
     -------------
     The going currency is the BELGIAN FRANC.

     At this time the exchange rate is about as follows :

                   1 US$ =   35,08    B-francs     USA
                   1 ECU =   42,2975    "          EEC
                   1 FFR =    6,155     "          France
                   1 PST =   57,48      "          U.K.
                   1 IRP =   55,42      "          Ireland
                   1 DM  =   20,684     "          Germany
                   1 SFR =   23,407     "          Switzerland
                   1 HFL =   18,3765    "          The Netherlands
                 100 LIT =    2,815     "          Italy
                   1 DKR =    5,41      "          Denmark
                   1 SKR =    5,716     "          Sweden
                   1 NOK =    5,345     "          Norway
                 100 PTA =   32,53      "          Spain
                   1 FMK =    8,761     "          Finland

     People from former eastern bloc countries, please be advised
     that under normal conditions you still are not allowed to
     export local currencies from your countries. Should you bring
     local currencies anyway, please be advised that banks take from
     7 to 14 days to exchange them, if they do so at all (Hungarian
     Forints can be exchanged, others are unsure). The rate is also
     very unfavorable (and there is no black market). It is strongly
     advised you obtain a non-eastern European currency.

     3. Electricity :
     ----------------
     Should you bring electronic appliances, please check the
     required voltage.

     In Belgium 220V alternating current at 50 Hz is universal.
     Plugs are standard as in The Netherlands, Germany and some
     other European countries (not U.K., Ireland, Switzerland, ...).

     FidoNews 7-20                Page 9                   14 May 1990


     4. Traffic-jams :
     -----------------
     The week-end of 14/15 July has major movements of masses of
     people all over Europe leaving on or just returning from their
     holiday. Please take this into account when planning your
     travel by car.

     Also, if you're intending to cross France on your inbound
     and/or outbound journey, the 14th is their national holiday. So
     the day prior to that week-end (Friday 13th) or just after it
     (Monday 16th) you could experience difficulties due to the
     unavailability of certain services.

     5. For your reference, here are the prices of some commodities
     in Belgium :
     --------------------------------------------------------------
     * A package of cigarettes :   84 Bfr (*L*'s brand)
     * 1/2 pint of Lager :         30 Bfr (but there's better stuff)
     * Portion of fries with mayonnaise : 55 Bfr
     * McDonnalds' "Big Mac" :            97 Bfr
     * 1 litre of unleaded gas :          27 Bfr
     * 1 litre of leaded gas :            29 BFr
     * 1 litre of diesel-oil :            17 Bfr
     * 1 litre of milk :                  22 Bfr
     * A loaf of white bread (+/-1kg) :   50 Bfr
     * 1/2 pound of butter :              50 Bfr

     advantageous fares can be offered if you plan to come to
     Europe.

     And now for something completely different ...

     To make this European-meeting of FidoNet participants more
     attractive, we've taken the initiative to organize parallel to
     EUROCON-IV another international event.

     Whereas EUROCON looks more at the political and organizational
     point of view of communicating in our net, TECHCON-I will be
     THE thing not to miss if you're interested in the technical
     aspects of our pass-time.

     We believe a very good programme is being put together, the
     main items are being listed below, though proper scheduling
     over the two days still has to take place :

               * V42/V42bis
               * FTSC
               * European Standards
               * Virus
               * Data-compression
               * New products
               * FidoNet Compatible Architecture
               * Mailers
               * Fido-software for non-IBM PC's
               * Message-fossils

     Apart from this we are trying to organize, as part of
     TECHCON-I, a mystery-event which at this time we are still
     calling

                    "The clash of the titans"

     Further announcements on this will follow later ...

     You ain't seen nothing yet ...

     1) Wheelin' 'n dealin' :
     ------------------------
     At the same time of anything else, a mini-market for
     conference-attenders alone will be available to strike deals on
     computer- and communication equipment.

     Modems and other stuff will be available at special
     sysop-prices.

     FidoNews 7-20                Page 13                  14 May 1990


     ... if a good deal is the name, then Eurocon-IV is your game...

     2) Other amateur PC-uses :
     --------------------------
     There will be constant demo's of other amateur and
     non-commercial PC-use.

     Some of the demo's will be :

               - Packet-radio transmissions
               - Satellite-photo composition
               - Waste-water-currents modelling in the Northsea
               - Transforming WordPerfect text to braille-text for
                 the visually impaired on a special braille-printer
               - ...

     3) USERCON-I :
     --------------
     During Euro/Tech-con there will be a 3rd conference dedicated
     especially to Belgian users and points.

     It will deal with the beginners-aspects of communicating via
     FidoNet.

     This conference is exclusively in Dutch and will only take
     place on the 14th.

     Further announcements about it will follow.

     4) Computer-Widows :
     --------------------
     A special programme is being put together for the
     computer-widows accompanying their male life-partner.
     Computer-widowers are very welcome as well of course.

     The programme will consist of touristical and leisure points of
     interest as well as shopping bargains.

     The programme will run at a modest fee covering costs only.
     Further announcements about it, as well as the cost, will be
     published shortly.

     5) Children programme :
     -----------------------
     If parents bring their children along and would like us to
     organize a special programme for kids while they (=the parents)
     attend EUROCON-IV, then please indicate so on the registration
     form, as well as their languages spoken, their age and their
     sex.

     Depending upon the number of children subscribed, activities
     will be organized for them by qualified people.

     FidoNews 7-20                Page 14                  14 May 1990


     The programme will run at a modest fee covering costs only.
     Further announcements about it, as well as the cost, will be
     published when it becomes clear enough children will be
     attending.

     6) Infant care :
     ----------------
     Young parents wanting to bring their infant children along and
     not having to bother about them during conference-hours may
     indicate this wish, as well as the age of the child on the
     registration form.

     If enough infant children and/or babies are subscribed, then a
     nursery will be set up in the conference-hotel by qualified
     staff.

     The programme will run at a modest fee covering costs only.
     Further announcements about it, as well as the cost, will be
     published when it becomes clear enough infant children and or
     babies will be attending.

     7) General remark :
     -------------------
     It must be well understood that the children- and/or
     infant-care-programme will be cancelled if the
     organization-committee considers that too few subscriptions
     were entered to offer it.

     Accommodation is in the "Pullman Hotel" in Antwerp, it is the
     same hotel where EUROCON-IV takes place.

     It is a *****-hotel, but we managed to negotiate with them
     ***-prices for hotel-rooms as well as renting the
     conference-rooms. These rates are only possible because the
     organization-committee is handling reservations and payments
     themselves.

     So when registering, please do not wait too long with your
     payment.

     2) Youth-Hostel :
     -----------------
     We have reserved a number of sleeping-places at the
     International Youth Hostel of Antwerp. It is 5-10 minutes
     walking from the conference-hotel.

     FidoNews 7-20                Page 15                  14 May 1990


     The Youth Hostel Rates are :

               - Bed & breakfast : ...................  295 Bfr
               - Lunch : .............................  100 Bfr
               - Dinner : ............................  210 Bfr
               - Renting sheets : ....................  100 Bfr

     You have to be a member of the International Youth Hostel
     Federation. If you are not a member, 80 Bfr extra will be
     charged per night.

     If you are interested in staying overnight at the Youth Hostel,
     we will make the reservations for you but in no case will we
     handle the payments as bank-charges on international transfers
     would nearly double that amount.

     Please be advised that these reservations are on a "first
     come/first served" basis and the number of beds is limited.

     3) Municipal camping-ground :
     -----------------------------
     If you bring your camping-equipment we can arrange a place for
     you at the municipal camping ground. If you wish, we will make
     these reservations for you, but in no case will we handle the
     payments, that is completely up to you.

     The municipal camping ground is 5-10 minutes walking from the
     conference- hotel.

     4) General remark :
     -------------------
     Please keep in mind that for each valid registration, 4
     coffee-breaks and 2 lunches are included in the conference-fee.

     Participants to EUROCON-IV will have free access to TECHCON-I
     and vice- versa.

     However, in order to prepare for the number of people who will
     attend, we would like to ask you to state a preference as
     mentioned on the registration-form.

     A special insurance will be taken out to cover attenders and
     their families present for accidents that could happen to them
     while at the premisses of EUROCON-IV.

     At regular intervals further announcements about EUROCON-IV
     will be made via the special echo "EURO4" which is now being
     distributed via usual echomail-channels.

            ANNOUNCING: THE MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING (MLM) ECHO

     We have started a new echo called MLM, the echo for those
     involved or interested in Multi-Level Marketing (sometimes also
     known as "network marketing").  For those of you who are not
     familiar with the phrase "Multi-Level Marketing", this is the
     method by which a large number of products and services are
     sold nowadays.  Some of the better-known firms in this field
     are Amway (home care and other products), and A.J. Williams
     (insurance), but there are literally hundreds of firms that
     utilize this method of marketing their products.

     The need for this echo arose from the fact that messages
     relating to Multi-Level Marketing were appearing with
     increasing frequency in echoes such as FOR-SALE and JOBS.  The
     moderators of such echoes consider MLM discussions as
     "off-topic" and therefore, it is difficult to have a discussion
     about the real benefits or the pitfalls of any such plans.  The
     MLM echo is being introduced to provide a place where such
     discussions will be "on-topic."

     We expect that those who particiapte in the MLM echo will agree
     that Multi-Level Marketing is a valid and responsible method of
     marketing products.  HOWEVER, we also recognize that there are
     irresponsible people who try to use MLM as a "cover" for
     illegal pyramid schemes, but that does not detract from the
     fact that MLM itself is a very valid method of selling products
     or services direct to the customer, that has been utilized for
     years.  Those who disagree, or who feel that _all_ MLM activity
     is a scam of some type, should not be participating in this
     echo.

     The main purpose of this conference is for those engaged in
     Multi-Level Marketing (MLM), or those interested in MLM, to
     discuss various tips, techniques, methods, warnings, legal
     matters, and other information of general interest to those
     engaged in MLM.  Obviously, this will also be a place where
     some of the scams and less-than-honorable operations will also
     be exposed, though the primary purpose of this echo is not to
     "bash" competitive products or services.

     All participants in this conference will be expected to conduct
     themselves in a professional manner.  If you read (or
     participate in) other Fidonet echomail conferences, you may
     have the idea that it's okay to flame people or otherwise act
     like a jerk.  That is definitely NOT the case in this echo.
     Participants are encouraged to read the rules of the echo
     (which will be made available for file request on 1:154/9 under
     the filename "MLM.RUL") before linking in.  We really want to
     try and keep this a high-quality echo that is worth reading
     (particularly since "time is money" to those involved in MLM).

     If you (or the users of your BBS) would be interested in
     picking up the MLM echo, please consult first with your Net or
     Regional Echomail Coordinator since the echo is carried on the
     Fidonet backbone.  If he absolutely cannot link you in, then
     please send me netmail at 1:154/8 and I will see if there is
     some way that we can arrange a feed for you (please let me know
     your maximum modem speed in this case).

                    RUMOURS ABOUND! about the
                  REGION 17 FIDONET(r) CONVENTION

     Because this  will  be  the  only  FidoNet convention on the West
     Coast this summer,  a  number  of  Famous Fido Folks from outside
     Region 17 are considering  attending.  DOUG BOONE has promised to
     take  a  "short"  vacation  from  Opus  1.20  development,  VINCE
     PERRIELLO will robot the FidoNews that  weekend,  and  ROD BOWMAN
     will meander north from Region 10.   Sorry  we  can't  reveal any
     other names until they've confirmed their plans.

     A  major  international  electronics  firm  located  in Portland,
     Oregon, has asked permission to make a "significant" announcement
     at  the Regional FidoNet convention to be held July 27-29,  1990.
     They  will  also  be providing some of their products for prizes!
     (The  unidentified  firm   is  neither  Nike  nor  a  bungee-cord
     producer!)

     However, the traditional Curmudgeon toss _has_ been replaced this
     year with "Curmudgeon bungee diving"  -  an  event more suited to
     the unique natural setting of the  Menucha Retreat and Conference
     Center, high on a bluff overlooking the Columbia River Gorge.


             * * * * * * THIS IS IMPORTANT!! * * * * * *

     The  reason  Net105 chose Menucha as the  site  (aside  from  its
     obvious attractions of seclusion and natural beauty) was  because
     of  its  exceptionally  reasonable  prices!    In return, Menucha
     requires con-  firmation  re:    the  number  of  attendees and a
     substantial deposit sixty  days  prior to the convention.  That's
     why we designed the  registration  form  with  "late  fees"  - to
     encourage early registration.

     IF you are considering attending  the Region17 Convention, please
     send NetMail to Ken Zwaschka at 1:105/54 - THIS WEEK!  Otherwise,
     we cannot guarantee that there will be  enough  places  available
     for late (and especially) last-minute registrants.

     I know who the unnamed FidoFamous Folks are - and I'll be there!

     The Electronic Pyramid Scam --

     Makecash, Cash-4u, Fastbuck, Easy$, etc.

     I have DELETED several of these from my upload area recently.
     I am even seeing the text files included in otherwise innocuous
     uploads such as BBS lists.  These are nothing more than PYRAMID
     MARKETING schemes outlawed years ago.

     To be fair, these modern electronic chain letters avoid the
     rules related to the postal chain letters because they offer a
     product for sale.  However, there is no direct mechanism in
     place to avoid the 4th level of a 'network marketing'
     structure, which is illegal.  NETWORKING is the modern name for
     a controlled pyramid organization. Pyramid organizations are
     quite legal out to the 3rd level, but not the fourth.

     Short of calling the police, I can't imagine a way to stop this
     kind of abuse.  I'd love to here your ideas on the subject. (
     But only if they agree with mine ! )


     486 On the March --

     There seems to be quite a rush of 486 PCs coming out this year.
     It's always fun to see your old computers become more worthless
     all the while doing more than they ever did.  The trend towards
     faster PCs has followed pretty closely an old rule about
     microprocessor development, ie. that micros double in speed and
     density every two years.  My particular case is a perfect
     example.

     In July 1985 I purchase my first AT, a Compaq 286 8Mh portable,
     for $5000.  It's still in service, running 24 hours a day as
     124/6119.  Of course, it's got 8 times the original disk space.

     In July 1987 I purchased my first 386, a Compaq 386 16Mh for,
     yes $5000.  Now I did add lots of memory to it, but it's still
     running, in fact, I'm writing this on it while it runs
     124/6120.

     This trend ( '85 286-8, '87 386-16 ) would lead me to believe
     that in 1989 I could purchase a 386 33Mh for $5000.  This was,
     in fact, true.  However, due to the imminent release of the
     486, I determined that a wait was in order.  I now see that a
     1990 486-25 for $5000 is possible.

     FidoNews 7-20                Page 24                  14 May 1990


     Following the trend further, 1991 should bring a 486-33 at our
     benchmark price, and 1993 must be the year of the 586 or better
     at some 60 Mh.  Since I've skipped a year, I'm due a hot new
     machine !


     MS C 6.0 --

     Representative of the goodies which arrived recently, MS C 6 is
     in use here.  I've been reading about _fastcall, the advisor,
     new Codeview options and better optimization options.  True to
     Earth day, Microsoft sent quite a bit less paper, although it
     seems complete and concise.  "Just use the old binders" !  I
     have been looking at the /W4 maximus warnings switch, whew,
     what a mess I have.

     Oracle 5.1C arrived with VPIC support.  This should mean I can
     run Oracle's protected interface along with expanded memory
     drivers, even Desqview.  It works.  I have to get Oracle's
     library and MS' new C libraries integrated at work.  Finger's
     crossed.

     QEMM 5.0 is a welcome addition.  Comes with a really
     interesting SYSTEM STATUS program, Manifest.  I have a Compaq
     386, but I have to run the NOCOMPAQFEATURES switch ?!?  Don't
     even know why, but I do and it works.  I do run Desqview
     constantly.

     Math Rabbit ( what, a game ) got installed immediately.  My son
     really liked Reader Rabbit, and he loves this.  When you win a
     round with the rabbit on the tightrope, he does one of three
     dances.  In the third dance, he does this Michael Jackson
     'Reverse Moon Walk Glide' that can't be adequately described.
     Terrible graphics ( CGA ) but Kevin loves it.


     Clean That Office, or Else --

     Honey threw a fit.  It really was a mess.  I started Saturday
     afternoon by purchasing a couple of nice chairs and another
     table top.  The rolling chair made it possible to put computers
     behind and in front of me, and the additional work space will
     be taken up by a new machine coming in for a client.

     I started Sunday morning, carrying everything out to the living
     room floor.  Honey grabbed the kid disappeared for a few hours.
     By 11 ( right on schedule ) the computers went off line, and
     the room was nearly empty.  A quick clean and it was time to
     bring it all back in.  Done by 1.

     Do you have many stacks of old papers on your floor ?  Each
     one, no matter the topic, containing some obscure BBS utility
     document printout, usually 50 pages long ?  Do you have
     thousands of diskettes that you have no idea of the contents ?
     Here is another summer job for computer literate kids. Pay em a
     few bucks an hour to catalog all those disks.

     Honey returned home and was quite pleased.  She let me put up
     the swimsuit calendar that her grandmother gave me for
     Christmas.  I can't wait for July !
