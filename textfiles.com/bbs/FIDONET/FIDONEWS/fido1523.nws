     =================================================================
                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================


     In the news, a few items...

     The FidoNews Web Site (www.fidonews.org) was down earlier this week,
     per an E-Mail from Jim Barchuk, who maintains it for all of Fido.
     Any mail sent through the site, as well as files or subscriptions,
     were held at his provider until the system could be re-built.  As of
     our last discussions, the site is back on-line and running.

     Richard Peer is the new Z5C, as Henk Wolsink has stepped down, much
     to the joy of the Z2C, no doubt.  I've had the privilege to have been
     in contact with Henk for some time, and have come to respect his
     ideas.  While not leaving Fido, his presence will be remembered for
     some time to come.

     Adrian Walker has stepped down as the Zone 1 EchoList Coordinator,
     with the June 1998 ECHOLIST being his final publication.  While
     Adrian is admired for his work, it is odd that he would hand over his
     source code, long stated as both his own and not to be disclosed, to
     John Souvestre...the same person who has also removed echomail
     conferences that he did not personally approve of from distribution.

     Then again, who is the EchoList Back-up Password Keeper these days?

     Moreover, given his past distaste for an official FidoNet posting,
     why would John be given the source code without the proviso that it
     is to be passed along to the next duly appointed EchoList Coordinator
     without question?

     Just as oddly, John has decided to post a message from an echo into
     the FidoNews.  In the sense of fairness and balance, the response to
     it is also posted.  The message, while apparently intended for _last_
     week's issue, was delayed to this one as John does not believe in
     following the article submission specifications in the ARTSPEC.DOC
     policy...the Editor does not routinely search other echoes than those
     indicated for the purposes of accepting submissions.

     And, unlike John's messages, the responses in FIDONEWS are not
     censored to bring across points while avoiding others of greater
     import.

     In a lighter note, Bruce Bodger has decided to take Bob Moravsik to
     task over repeated "attempts" to "hijack" various echoes.

     What's so humorous about this is that Moravsik is merely taking
     advantage of the very system that Bodger and Souvestre *imposed* on
     FidoNet, the one imposed after the BackBone Operations Policy was
     revoked by...Bodger and Souvestre.

     In another odd development, the RECC, in the guise of Ben Hamilton,
     has cast a 'no confidence' vote against Bob Kohl, the Zone 1 EchoMail
     Coordinator.  See the text submitted below.

     FIDONEWS 15-23               Page 2                    8 Jun 1998


     Odd, since Bob is the _first_ person elected in a Zone-wide,
     SYSOP-LEVEL election, and thus represents the Zone; that, and the
     RECC holding secret meetings and refusing to discuss matters with the
     ZEC, and other similarly puerile activities, make it odd that Ben and
     the RECC would not include their 'list of grievances' that they claim
     would prove their position...in a public setting.

     After all, the RECC posted the vote in public; why _not_ the reasons?

     In light of the actions of Adrian Walker to hand over control of the
     ELIST to the NAB entirely, rather than maintaining it as an entity
     independent of a commercial organization, it would behoove the RECC
     to act to _protect_ EchoMail distribution, rather than attempt to
     destroy or castrate that protection.

     Likewise, as was pointed out elsewhere, the term of office of the
     OBO, or Overseer of BackBone Operations, Butch Walker, is expired on
     12 June 1998.  He had previously indicated that he would not seek
     re-election.

     Butch effectively disappeared as the OBO after his unilateral
     declaration that all nodes which distribute EchoMail are under the
     direct authority of the OBO and the NAB.

     Strange that the RECC was so deathly silent on that issue, acting as
     individuals instead of a group...and now, when there is a ZEC who is
     not the hand-picked appointee of the NAB, they act to silence or
     remove him en masse and as a bloc.

     Who, then, will be the liaison between the RECC and the NAB?

     Or is the RECC destroying its best chance of maintaining the
     independence of EchoMail by becoming the willing tools of the NAB,
     by eliminating a ZEC who will not submit to the will of the NAB in
     all matters EchoMail?

     It is hoped that the Z1C sees past the rhetoric and lack of reasoning
     involved, and directs the RECC to accept mediation...otherwise, there
     can be no confidence in future elections at the sysop level, if
     manipulation and personal problems can be used to negate those votes.

     And, while all of this goes on, the Year 2000 Bug moves closer to
     taking FidoNet apart completely.

     In the last week, two more losses to the FidoNet Technical Standards
     Committee have occurred, with Richard Bash and Craig Box announcing
     that they will be leaving.  So far, not much else has been allowed to
     reach my system.  That means (for you keeping score) that Rune
     Johansen, Peter Karlsson and Tom Schlangen have left the 'new' FTSC,
     and not one 'official' announcement has yet to be made...

     And, for a later discussion, please keep in mind the Magic Numbers...
     34, 38 and 74.

     Wouldn't it be nice to have a genuinely non-political hobby once
     again, where the only rhetoric was over the political issues of the

     FIDONEWS 15-23               Page 3                    8 Jun 1998


     day, rather than where your next EchoMail packet was coming from?

     In response to last week's question to the readership, the idea of
     the inclusion of advertising in FidoNews has been...well...'mixed' is
     a word to consider...

     I would lean to the inclusion in a separate file, but more to keeping
     the information intact...but read the responses for yourself...

     Sail on, sail on...but never stop asking, "Why?"

     [EDITOR'S NOTE:

     The following was a message posted by John Souvestre in the Z1C Echo,
     and as noted, the request to publish this in the FidoNews is within.

     However, since articles and messages are generally sent through the
     FIDONEWS echo or by one of the regular mail services, it was not
     noted in time for last week's issue.

     In the interest of balance, the response to this message is also

     Yes, you and Bob Kohl have long told lies about my system.  Now we
     see that it is you and Bob Kohl who read and disclose in-transit
     netmail.  The truth comes out finally.

     NC/RC/NEC/REC/ZEC, has been show to disclose in-transit routed
     netmail on two recent occasions.  Tell the world how you, his RHub,
     support him in these actions.

     On the contrary, John.  Or did you lose your copy of the Policy
     Complaint that you filed over this?

     And what lies are these, John?  Or are you focusing _everyone_else's_
     comments about your system and trying to blame myself and Bob Kohl
     over them?

     If you did not interfere with the distribution of FLAME, then who did?

     If you have proof that Brent Hamm 'crashed' the Gateway, where is it?

     If you have no interest in Regional administration, why did you fight
     so hard to keep the Region 10 echoes flowing _through_ your system?

     I'll expect you to present proof of your claim that I am reading and
     disclosing in-transit netmail, John.

     A little late, John...it will have to go in next week's issue, though
     you may wish to re-write it to sound a little less petulant.

     IDEAS FOR FIDONET IN ROTARY ORGANIZATION?
     -----------------------------------------
     Last weekend Ed and I attended the Rotary District 5100 conference in
     Pendleton, OR.

     Rotary is an international organization, larger and more extensive
     than FidoNet, which operates almost entirely with unpaid elected
     official who serve for ONE year (there is a salaried
     secretary-general and small staff in the international headquarters
     in Evanston, IL). The entire Rotary administration, worldwide, turns
     over on 01-July each year. This has always amazed me. How can Rotary
     achive continuity?

     Primarily by electing the key official at each level a year in
     advance.

     Rotary is organized geographically (although individuals can join any
     club).
     Club                    District               International
     Club President          District Governor      Governor General

     Each Rotary Club level has a BOD consisting of the officials above
     (serving for the current year), the elected officials,
     President-Elect & Governors-Elect (who will serve the following
     year), the past President or Governor, plus the usual VP, Secretary,
     Treasurer and committee chairmen. It is, more or less, eighteen
     months from the vote for a President-Elect until he or she takes
     office as Club President on the first of July. Past Presidents are
     only on the BOD for one year, although they continue to be honored in
     various ways (Rotary is big on ribbons <g>).

     NODELIST
     --------
     There is an interesting change occurring in the "Net" 1:1 section of
     the nodelist. For years, the Zone 1 RECs have had redundant 1:1/21x
     nodelistings. For example, Bob Seaborn, REC of Region 17, was
     1:1/217. Now only 1:1/212, 214, 215 & 219 are left. The R10EC
     position is currently vacant and the others are using redundant
     entries in the regional segments. For example, Bob Seaborn is 1:17/1.
     IMHO, it is best to use the REC's "real" node number which can be
     found in backstat.na.

     FIDONEWS 15-23               Page 7                    8 Jun 1998


     Once upon a time the regional SDS (file echo) distributors had
     1:1/31x nodelistings, but those were dropped many years ago.

     ASIA
     ----
     The Zone 6 segment of the nodelist continues to be a disaster area.

     There have been nodelist changes in Region 62 (Taiwan), Region 63
     (Japan) and Region 64 (Philippines), including a new R62C, Chinian
     Wang (replacing Philip Jones) and a new R63C, Shinji Nishikawa
     (replacing Bill English), so I am assuming those regional segments
     are current.

     A new Net (6:759, Pakistan) has been added in Region 64
     (Philippines)!!!

     There have been no changes in Region 60 (Singapore, Malasia,
     Thailand, India), Region 61 (Hong Kong & Macau), Region 65 (China) or
     Region 66 (Korea) for AT LEAST five months and probably much longer.

     I can only assume that these four RCs are MIA.

     Region,60,ASEAN_Region,SINGAPORE,Wing_Lee,65-2410418
     Region,61,REGION_61_COORDINATOR,HONG_KONG_&_MACAU,R61C,852-2505-2499
     Region,65,Fido_Mainland_China,Beijing,Roy_Luo,886-2-727-6059
     Region,66,FidoNet_Korea,Seoul_(Yongsan),Bill_Harms,82-2-7918-7032,9600

     In the case of India (Net 6:606, Region 60), there are "new" nodes
     who were assigned node numbers by their NC *MORE THAN A YEAR AGO* who
     are not yet in the international FidoNet nodelist. Some of these
     nodes are echomail participants, getting feedS from Zone 1, and can
     be reached via routed netmail.

     The Zone 6 nodelist became a controversial issue last November when
     Maulvi Bakar, a returning node in Malaysia, after extensive efforts
     to obtain a node number in Zone 6, obtained a node number in Net
     1:163. Maulvi called ALL of the sysops in the 6:609 (Malaysia_Net)
     nodelist segment and did not find a single FidoNet mailer answering
     the phone. The R60C, Wing Lee, was answering FAX. Maulvi Bakar's BBS
     is offline, probably a victim of the Asian financial crisis; the
     6:609/xxx nodes are still in nodelist.156 :-(

     I don't see how anyone can initiate Policy4 amendments without
     resolving the Zone 6 nodelist problems first. Yo, Bob Satti! What
     needs to be done? I'd guess it might be cheaper to dial some of those
     areas from the US than from Japan. If $$$ are needed to pay for calls
     to establish which nodes are "on the air," I am willing to coordinate
     a voluntary fund raising effort for that purpose.

     NODELIST TRIVIA
     ---------------
     At least two of the 50 USA states (Montana and Alaska) have no
     FidoNet Nets. Montana has no FidoNet nodes; Alaska has two regional
     independent nodes.

     DA BROKEN BIRD
     --------------
     On Tuesday evening, 21-Apr-98, the Galaxy 4 satellite abruptly
     stopped functioning. The Planet Connect 19200 C-Band and Ku-band
     broadcasts were both carried on that bird, yet the sattelite failure
     went almost unnoticed in FidoNet. Why was that? Well, the Planet
     Connect topology, which once accounted for 70-80% of backbone
     echomail traffic, now only represents about 9%. And Planet Systems
     Inc. seems to have responded promptly. During the first days after
     the G4 failure, echomail bundles were freely available for anonymous
     ftp from Planet Connect's Internet site. The Planet Connect
     broadcasts are now available from Galaxy 6, although I am not sure
     what someone who was setup to receive from Galaxy 4 has to do to
     receive from Galaxy 6.

     THIS 'N THAT
     ------------
     On 05-Jun-98, Adrian Walker, Echolist Coordinator, etc., announced:
     -- that the June Elist would come out this weekend, Jun 6-7th
     -- that the June Elist would be the last he would publish
     -- that he (Adrian) would be pulling the plug on FidoNet in
        the next week or two

     -- Looks like Adrian's "backbone robot" and "backstat robot"
        functions will be taken over by John Souvestre.
     -- Looks like Adrian's RHub functions will be parted out among
        the other Region 17 RHubs.
     -- Dunno what will be happening to Adrian's Elist functions.

     You done good with the Elist, Adrian!

     Without fanfare, James Ray replaced Bruce Bodger as R19C a few weeks
     ago. I believe Region 19 has an annual RC election. I dunno who else
     ran, but incumbent Bruce Bodger was not a candidate (citing
     additional travel demands of his job).

     BOFAQ Q21 says:
     "The term of the present OBO is 1 year and expires on June 10, 1998."
     Butch Walker is the present OBO, and if there is an OBO election
     going on, it is a well kept secret.

     OFF TO CHICAGO
     --------------
     Not one, not two, but three family members in Chicago have narrowly
     escaped the clutches of the grim reaper. Now that the Metro election
     is over (Ed lost; cf http://www.co.clackamas.or.us, click on Election
     Results), we're leaving Tuesday for 10 days in the city of my birth.

     Posted in RGN17, Z1_BACKBONE, Z1C, FN_SYSOP; Submitted to FidoNews.
     Echomail replies may expire before I return, so forward a netmail
     carbon copy.

     No Confidence Called Against ZEC by RECC
     submitted by Ben Hamilton, R19EC

     [EDITOR'S NOTE:  The following was submitted without title or any
     other information.  While it is believed to be from the legitimate
     source, it was not presented as an 'official' statement by the
     RECC, nor was it signed by them.
                                            -Editor]


      > If the RECC concludes that the ZEC is not active, ineffective
      > in his/her job or is just not taking care his/her
      > responsibilities; they may take a vote of no-confidence. If
      > the vote of no-confidence passes with a 2/3rds majority, the
      > RECC will refer this issue to the ZC for mediation or action
      > as the Z1C sees fit.

     After consulting with the sysops in their regions, the RECC recently
     conducted a vote on the above.  The following REC's voted NO
     CONFIDENCE:  12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

     That is a total of eight of the RECs, far more than a 2/3rds
     majority.

     I will not go into the reasons for the necessity of the vote at
     this time.  Suffice it to say that they are many.

     Therefore, as stated in the ZEC duties which were recently
     written by Bob Kohl, this situation has been brought to the
     attention of the Z1C, Bob Satti, so that he can decide on the
     best course of action.

     =================================================================
                                  COLUMNS
     =================================================================



     Dear Editorbeing,

     This article is submitted by Doc Logger (163/110) who was
     found wandering alone in the woods with third degree crouton
     wounds covering his body. Never again will Logger order the
     tossed salad at a charity dinner hosted by American League
     baseball pitchers.

     Roll da flic, Zorch....

     Dear Reverend Visage,

     You'll be pleased to know that my missives have passed the
     "Moravsik Litmus Test." In last week's Snooz, the lead
     article was a thoughtful, and almost literate, critique by
     Bob Moravsik. As you can well imagine, my definition of hell
     is to have Moravsik agree with me on anything so I am much
     comforted by his screed. He suggested that I "go away and
     leave Fidonet to normal people." Had he accused me of
     normality, I would have been forced to challenge him to a
     duel with broccoli jello at 40 paces to avenge my honour. If
     I catch his drift, he views my writing as sub-normal and
     that I ought to stand aside so that his genius can properly
     illuminate his perceived wisdom for Fidonet. Poor Bob
     suffers from the delusion that the known universe will
     collapse if even more people started snickering at the
     absurdity of Peefour. His dogged determination reminds me of
     the Creationists who want to curtail the world of scientific
     inquiry because their team rule book already describes
     everything they need or want to know about the universe.

     Visage, you'll be impressed by my reading material this
     week. For example, I read the policy complaint filed by His
     Zorchness against Ruth Argust for a variety of perceived
     Fidocrimes. The complaint was bundled with a dog's breakfast
     of files and cross-references, but the gist of it is that
     poor Zorch has his knickers in a knot because Ruth's mailer
     flies some sort of NC address in the handshake protocol.
     Even more amusing, one of the items on the complaint list
     was an accusation that Ruth has been fibbing. Sigh, try to
     imagine the depths of quicksand His Zorchness must be
     standing on to accuse someone else of being economical with
     the truth. What makes the complaint even more amusing is
     that it will eventually end up in the lap of Bob Kohl.
     Naturally, Kohl will be able to set aside his long history
     of personal enmity towards Ruth such that he can rule
     objectively on an appeal. And if you believe that, would you
     be interested in a lucrative investment in badger sperm
     futures?

     FIDONEWS 15-23               Page 11                   8 Jun 1998


     It will also be a great shock to you that Bob "noted" Satti
     is still blissfully slumbering while Region10 devolves into
     a cacophony of policy complaints and torched NCs. Satti's
     somnolence must have something to do with the fact that he
     is so gosh darned busy with his newly acquired IC duties.
     Unfortunately, more than the usual rabble have started to
     pose pointed questions to Satti which he has been ignoring
     like the plague, but it does serve as an object lesson in
     how manifestly unsuited he is to whichever powers he
     presumes to have. Perhaps if he switched to a higher wattage
     coffee he'd be able to stay awake long enough to write a
     whole sentence in the Z1C echo.

     For my Chautauqua this week I'd like to lead off with a
     quote from Stephen Fry, a writer after my own heart who
     doesn't treat fools kindly. This quote appears in Fry's
     book "Paperweight." Fry's essay was written in response to a
     huge volume of vituperative mail he received in response to
     a newspaper article. Evidently, Bob Moravsik's clones
     languish throughout society as a sort of dry-rot of the
     collective intelligence.

     "I suppose letter-writers are driven by a kind of
     frustration. They are given furiously to wonder why this
     figure or that should be given a public platform for their
     facile and muddle-headed views. Without such a platform
     themselves, they have no recourse but to their writing desks
     where they pour out all the bitterness and accreted venom of
     a lifetime.... All I can observe is that no one challenges
     the rights of journalists and writers with whom they are in
     agreement. If we agree, we applaud the stout good sense and
     the witty disparagement; if we disagree, we froth and
     fulminate against the snide, graceless tone and the
     gratuitous insult and we question what business these
     writers have to be addressing the world in the first place."

     I would say that my feedback on Snooz articles can be
     divided into thirds. The first and most satisfying to the
     ego are laudatory, the middle third say nice things but
     whose purpose in writing is to correct minor errors in the
     text - such as the number of people who found it ironic last
     week than in a paragraph railing against illiteracy that I
     would have incorrectly singularized a word that should have
     been plural; and the final third falls almost off the map.
     The most generous of the final third suggest that I ought to
     consider suicide as the quickest and most effective cure to
     Fidonet's ills. Others, offer to end my life for me - which
     clearly puts the lie to the claim that you simply can't find
     helpful people in Fidonet any longer.

     The group of people who take such colourful exception to
     what I write are affectionately called the "How Dare You"s
     because that is the most frequent lead phrase to their
     spavined ravings. It is often remarkably difficult to
     discern which ox I've gored that leads them to such flights
     of scatological polemic. In concert, they seem to feel that

     FIDONEWS 15-23               Page 12                   8 Jun 1998


     injecting multiple naughty words into their missives will
     wow me with the strength of their arguments. Alas, most of
     them are no better at expressing themselves than Moravsik.
     The marvel of their diatribes is that while they are busy
     suggesting that my drivel be removed from the Snooz, it
     hasn't seemed to occur to them that they could submit their
     own articles and have their brilliance outshine my feeble
     attempts at satire or wit.

     I also wonder at the assertion that "we have to have rules"
     as though that statement were self-evident. To what purpose,
     I ask? To shield us in a paternalistic sense from the
     barbarism of other sysops? Are all other sysops so cretinous
     that they must be whipped by compunction into submission?
     Perhaps it is a coincidence, but two of the most vocal rule
     mongers are lawyers. Lawyers, of course, are society's
     vermin whose sustenance is obtained by first writing rules,
     and then drawing an income from defending them.

     One last ponder before I put this article to bed. Why is it
     that in the Excited States with their much touted protection
     of free speech that they have both a law that forbids the
     electronic interception of mail without warrant, and another
     law that forbids the transmission of encryption algorithms?
     If they had reasonable encryption, it seems that they also
     wouldn't have to worry about interception.

     I must go, Visage, I have been invited to speak at the John
     Galt Society meeting taking as my topic: "Ayn Rand, Harmless
     Fruitbat or Dangerous Leftist?" I am sure to suffer grievous
     bun wounds from the projectiles which are launched at me
     from the dining tables. I go to the meeting with great hopes
     that I will finally meet the man who invented the electric
     artichoke steamer and then petulantly withheld this
     technological advance from society.

     Regards,
     Doc Logger,
     Furlang Island,
     South Pacific

     Responding to your question about commercial advertisements in
     FidoNews, my preferences, fwiw, would be as follows, in declining
     order.

     - Don't include them.
     - Include them summarized into a separate file.
     - Include them in a separate section near the end of FidoNews,
       after the articles.

     Thanks for requesting input.
