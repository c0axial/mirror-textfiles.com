                 Colorado splits into two area codes
                           (303 and 719)

     On March 5th, the state of Colorado will be split into two
     area codes. The current area code of 303 will remain with
     the city of Denver, the North and Western parts of the state.

     The new area code of 719, will be assigned to the Southeastern
     parts of Colorado. The cities of Colorado Springs, Pueblo will
     be in the new area code. Please consult your telephone directory,
     or you local phone company for more information.

     Since Net 128 is directly effective by this change, the Nodediff
     on March 4th will reflect this change. If you are using a modem
     program to directly call Southern Colorado, you need to note, and
     make this change.

     Since area code 303 has all but run out of prefixes, it is likely
     that calls to area code 303 will only work for 30 days after the
     change, if you are calling the new code area. After which, you may
     be surprised if you get a wrong number, or a non working number.

           DASNet - Linking FidoNet to Commercial E-Mail Systems
                                David Dodell
                         FidoNet 1:114/15 or 1:1/0


     I have been in contact with a  commercial  firm  which  links  up
     various  electronic  mail  systems  with  each  other.  They have
     expressed an interest in linking into FidoNet.  This  would  give
     commercial  electronic mail users the ability to send and receive
     mail from FidoNet addresses.

     While many would say that FidoNet should  not  be  exploited  for
     commercial gain, it would allow FidoNet users the ability to send
     mail  to commercial e-mail systems without having to subscribe to
     the multiple various systems out there.

     I am not saying that we  should  do  so,  but  rather  soliciting
     comments if we should pursue this further.  If you are interested
     please  send  mail  to either myself or to the marking manager of
     the DASNet system, Anna Lange.

     Anna can be contacted via my node by sending  mail  to  the  user
     "Usenet" at FidoNet node 114/15 and placing the following in  the
     first line of the body of the message:

     To: asuvax!noao!decvax!sun!11.DAS.NET!AnnaB

     Below  is  a  description  and information I received about their
     system.  Again, I am only interested in comments at this time.


                The DASnet(R) Network--DASnet Subscriptions:

     WHEN YOU ASK SOMEONE FOR AN  ELECTRONIC  MAIL  ADDRESS,  YOU  CAN
     PROBABLY REACH THEM--REGARDLESS OF THE SYSTEM THEY USE !!


     A  DASnet Subscription allows you to exchange electronic mail (e-
     mail)  with  anyone  on  more  than  20  systems  and   networks,
     INCLUDING:

         ATT Mail, DASnet(R) Network, DCMETA, Dialcom(SM), EIES,
         EasyLink(R), Envoy 100(TM), FAX, GeoMail, MCI Mail(R), NWI(R),
         PeaceNet/EcoNet, Portal Communications(TM), The Source(R),
         Telemail(R), ATI's Telemail (Japan), Telex, TWICS (Japan),
         UNISON(R), UUCP, The WELL, Domains e.g. ".COM" and ".EDU".

     If you currently use one of the systems mentioned above,  you can
     order a DASnet Subscription now.  For  more  information,  please
     call 408-559-7434.

     ADVANTAGES:

       * NOTHING NEW TO JOIN OR LEARN.  You continue to use the e-mail
         or conference system you already use on a regular basis--your
         home  system.  There's  no need to join another system for e-
     FidoNews 5-09                Page 3                   29 Feb 1988


         mail.  All you need is your DASnet Subscription.

       * EXCHANGE E-MAIL with nearly 3 MILLION  people--even  if  they
         use systems to which you are not a member.

       *  JUST  CHECK  ONE MAILBOX--EVER.  Your e-mail is delivered to
         your mailbox at your home system on a daily  basis  (on  some
         systems,  more  often).  Your home system is the only one you
         ever need to check for electronic mail.

     To send e-mail through DASnet, you send the message to the DASnet
     account on your home system.  You receive e-mail at your mailbox,
     as you do now.

     YOU ALWAYS  USE  YOUR  HOME  SYSTEM,  with  which  you've  become
     familiar  and  comfortable.  You  never  need to learn new menus,
     editors, or commands.


          HOW MUCH DOES A SUBSCRIPTION TO THE DASnet NETWORK COST?

     A Subscription costs only only $4.50/month ($5.50/mo.  for  hosts
     located outside of the U.S.).

     You  are also charged for each message that you send.  If you are
     corresponding with someone who is not a  DASnet  Subscriber,  you
     also pay to receive e-mail they send you.  (Sorry, it costs us so
     we have to bill you.  This is the only way that  we  could  offer
     you the service of making all of these systems available to you.)

     For example, here are charges for a couple of messages.

     1.  Jane  (on  UUCP)  sends a 2000-character message to John (who
         uses The Source).  The message will cost her 74 cents.
     2.  Robert (on MCI Mail  in  the  U.S.)  sends  a  2000-character
         message  to  Rachel  (using GeoMail in England).  The message
         costs only $1.70.

     -  Also,  consider the value of receiving e-mail on a daily basis
       at your  home  system--no  more  worry  about  urgent  messages
       waiting for you at the system you check only weekly.

                    --+--  FIDOCON '88 NEWS FLASH  --+--


     Cincinnati -  DELTA Airlines in cooperation with The
     International Fidonet Association announced today they will
     provide special air travel rates to the meeting August 25-28 here
     in Cincinnati.   "Travelers can expect to save 40%-75% off
     regular coach fares", Delta spokesperson Laverne Wright said.
     "Delta has set up a toll free 800 registration number for the
     event".

     "We are very excited about Delta's commitment", said Tim
     Sullivan, Chairperson of this year's conference. "I think that
     this will help to make Fidocon more accessible to Fidonet
     members".

     Delta is offering a 5% discount off ALL Delta's published
     round-trip fares INCLUDING SUPER SAVERS.  Delta also said for
     those passengers NOT qualifying for any published discounts, a
     40% discount will be offered on Delta's domestic system for
     travel to Fidocon '88.

     To take advantage of all these discount conference attendees need
     only follow these simple steps:

     1. Call 1-800-241-6760 for your reservations 8:00am-8:00pm
        eastern time - Daily.  Refer to FILE NUMBER N0059.
     or
        have your travel agent call Delta's tool free number to
        obtain the same advantages for you.

     2. Travel within the USA and San Juan only. (a 35% discount is
        applicable for travel from Canada)

     Delta noted that in order to take advantage of these discounts
     reservations must be made at least seven days in advance and must
     be made through Delta's toll free number.

     For more information contact your travel agent, Delta airlines at
     the toll free number, or Tim Sullivan at 108/62.  Cincinnati has
     also set up a special registration node 1/88 for information and
     on-line registration.

     INTERNATIONAL FIDONET ASSOCIATION

     The accompanying treasurer's report of International FIDONET
     Association as of December 31, 1987 has been prepared by me.

     This report is the representation of the International FIDONET
     Board of Directors.  I have not audited or reviewed this report
     and, accordingly, do not express an opinion or any other
     assurance on it.

     The International FIDONET Association Board of Directors has
     elected to omit substantially all of the disclosures (the
     Statements of Financial position, Results of Operations and
     Changes in Financial Position) required by generally accepted
     accounting principles.  If the omitted disclosures were
     included in this report, they might influence the readers'

     of operation, and changes in financial position.  Accordingly,
     this report is not designed for those who are not informed

     Greg Glynn
     The Airlock Hermitage
     3:712/502

                                What's in a Name?

     *HOT MUDDY DUCK* Now there's a great name for a bulletin board! I
     don't know who he is but he gets my vote for Most Original Name for a
     bulletin board. Mind you, he's got plenty of competition in the
     originality department.  I had a browse through the Nodelist recently
     (a little light reading) and found about 200 names which really
     standout as 'Above Average' in my opinion. Here's what I found.

     Some of these guys sound as if they had read headaches in trying to
     get their boards going! The Nervous System; Pipe Dream; The Town
     Cryer; Nightmare; Wits End; Krash #2; Mental Ward and Apocalypse.

     Once these next guys got started it seems that they formed their own
     secret societies: The Magic Unicorn; The Gathering; The Inner Circle
     and Magic Forest.

     These next names were a bit hard to classify. In one sense they're
     pretty obvious and in another way they're quite clever, I like the
     first one though: "I Have Decided"; Another Node; The Other BBS.

     A couple of these systems sound as if they're running MVS/XA rather
     than DOS 3.1: Deep Thought (Now there's a big computer!); Colossus;
     The Forbin Project; The IO Board; Mega Systems Online; Project Forty-
     Two and The Mega Monster. No shortage of MIPS there!

     Some quite clever "Play on words" too: The Ozone; Opus Pocus;
     Kat(h)'s Meow; NetMeg; Little Blue; Castle Opustein; Mobius Trip; Now
     & Zen; Log-on-the-Tyne and the Last Byte to name a few.

     And with a little imagination, a guy could get really carried away
     withthe next catagory - Dare I say it, Erotica: LoveLine; Sensual
     Encounter; Opus Orgy; Anything Goes; The Blow Torch; Pain Frame and
     finally The Gas Passer. Sounds like an episode of Dynasty.

     No shortage of Sci-Fi either! Forget about ALTERNET & SOUTHERNET,
     here comes CYBERNET: Cyber Zone; Cyber Space; Cyber Punk City; Cyber
     Babble; Cyber Foundation and CyberCom. A few more "cybers" and
     they'll have enough nodes to start Zone 4!

     Other Sci-Fi names too, like: Cygnus; House Adtreides; Moon Shadow;
     Forbidden Planet; SpaceNet; Starship Excalibur; Starlink; Entropy;
     Mind Meld; Time Traveller and Wally World (which isn't really Sci-Fi,
     I just wanted to see if you were paying attention).

     There are many BBS names which conjure up great mental images too.
     These are the boards which you might dial from 3,000 miles away out
     of shear curiosity: Dr Lizardos (expect an International Call in the
     near future Doc!); Family Skeletons; Whack!; The Bat Cave; The Toilet
     Seat (Great name! Gave *HOT MUDDY DUCK* a run for its money); The
     Fort Knox Files (If thats not a challenge to all you Hackaholics out
     there then I dont know what is!); 99 miles to somewhere; Ole Tin
     FidoNews 5-09                Page 8                   29 Feb 1988


     Brain; This End up; Quagmire; Hard Weird; Radio KAOS and the Poison
     Door.

     There's no shortage of "Animal SysOps" either: Swamp Buzzard; Shark
     Sandwich; Big Black Poodle; The Sleeping Gnome; Old Frogs Swamp;
     Stallion Data (A "Hung" System?).

     I've always had my own mental picture of what Fido (the dog) looks
     like in real life. It seems from the next set of names that my
     opinion is not universally shared by other users of the net: Mad Dog
     Fido; Green Fido; Orange Fido; Warped Dog; Soft Fido. But we do learn
     some interesting things about or four-legged friend: Fido's Kennel
     (Well at least he's got somewhere to sleep); Fido's Partner (and
     someone to sleep with); Poor Mans' Fido ; Fido's One Dish (but gets

                  Informed Consent

      To say a bill of rights is needed in FidoNet
     is like saying a drain plug is needed in the
     swamp. "Sir, I have no time to drain the swamp,
     I'am to busy fighting the aligators." Region 18
     has a new EchoMail coordinator. Located in a non-
     PCP city. Good thinking. At least he has a 9600
     baud HST and a sence of humor. The sence of humor
     is more important.
      Every NC in Region 18 cast their vote (pun intended)
     and the outcome was a new EC.
      Can anyone anywhere tell me why and how this happens?
     Does a friend of a friend call someone late in the night
     and make the change? Are there greater forces (farses)
     at work?
      Maybe I'am just missing the whole point. I'am sure
     there will be those who quickly agree. I'am having fun,
     right? I'am doing it out of love of my community and
     country, right? There must be some big dark echomail
     alley where good sysops fear to tread. In this alley
     big decisions are made late at night. This is done
     to keep from confusing the lowly sysop.
      Can someone humor me? Can I have a vote on something?
     The color of the FidoNet T-shirt? What the letters IFNA
     really mean? Anything would be a start. How about a
     dollar a vote? That way you get my dollar, I get a vote and
     all is right with the world. [offer limited to the state
     of North Carolina, February 20th. between the hours of
     midnight and 00:00:01 in the morning] Or more in keeping
     with tradition. You pay me a dollar for my vote.
      Come on you sysops. Do you want a vote? Do you even care?
     "Landrew lead me..." This beast we call FidoNet is neither
     fish or fowl. Let's make decisions based on information.
     "Informed Consent" is what it's called.

                            TRAIN Echo

      I am starting this new Model Railroad Echo in the interest
     of providing help to Model Railroaders and furthering the
     interest in Model Railroading. TRAIN will be supported
     partially by members of the Carolina Model Railroad club
     in Greensboro, NC. It will also, hopefully, be picked up by
     The Train Board in Ohio wich will provide enourmous help to
     users.
      I will work hard as the TRAIN echo's coordinator to make
     sure that it is run properly and I will be as helpful as
     possible.
      I hope that you will pick up this Echo on your node and
     allow the Model Railroaders of the world to help each other
     in this field. It can be picked up through REDCON at
     151/1000 and will be hosted out of Alert Data TBBS, 151/2,
     in Greensboro, NC. I will try to get information published
     in a few newsletters and magazines which should get Model
     Railroaders to ask their sysops for it.
      Please give it a try on your BBS.

     The Apple Core, Number 2
     Alan Applegate
     The Short Line, 1:104/36 (Fido 11w/BinkleyTerm)

           Security Series: Introduction, Session-Level Security

     Security is a growing concern within FidoNet.   Security can take
     many different forms, and mean many different things to different
     people.  In this and in future columns,  I'll talk a little about
     security related issues.

     Sysops   everywhere  are  concerned  with  destructive   software
     (viruses, trojans, worms, tapeworms, et al), breaches of password
     security, system infiltration by crackers/hackers, and so on.  Of
     more focused concern within FidoNet is session-level integrity of
     mail transmissions, packet integrity,  and the like.  This column
     addresses those concerns localized to FidoNet.

     Opinions  within FidoNet differ about how severe the problem  is,
     how  much potential there is for increased problems,  and how  to
     handle the situation now and in the future.  Some people are very
     passive,  with the attitude "it won't happen to me."  Some people
     insist  on  going  to  great  extents  to  protect  everything  -
     borderline paranoia.   But to say that the problem  doesn't exist
     today, right now, is to fool yourself.

     The  increased availability of NetMail interface packages such as
     BinkleyTerm  and  Dutchie has much to do with the problem.    The
     positive effect is that FidoNet is getting closer to becoming the
     tool  of  free  and open  communication  that  it  was  initially
     envisioned  to be.   Widely distributed software,  available with
     little  or  no charge,  is encouraging the  creation  of  FidoNet
     systems,  broadening our reach and resource base,  and increasing
     awareness of our network.

     The  negative  side effect is that this software is  more  openly
     available to people who are ready to abuse and misuse it to cause
     harm  and wreak havoc upon other FidoNet systems.   Don't get  me
     wrong -  as  part of the team  behind  BinkleyTerm,  I   strongly
     believe  that the  positives far outweigh the negatives with  the
     wide  and open availability these packages offer.   In  addition,
     the  potential  for  abuse has existed  since  the  inception  of
     FidoNet;   the  "new generation"  of FidoNet software  cannot  be
     blamed for this problem.

     The  key  here is to identify the potential for abuse,   make  an
     intelligent  decision  based  on our own situation,  and use  the
     powerful  tools  that  our software provides  to  avert  possible
     violation  of   our  systems  and  breaches of  the  confidential
     information which can often be found there.

     Session  level security is the most important of  the  protection
     FidoNews 5-09                Page 12                  29 Feb 1988


     methods  available  to  FidoNet,  and it guards against  what  is
     probably the most pernicious of the violations that can occur.

     The  ability exists today for someone to set-up their  system  to
     "look" like a system with which you regularly transact mail.  The
     bogus system polls you for mail that may be waiting for the  real
     system,  and unless the session requires a password,  the mail is
     handed  over  to  the bogus  system  without  hesitation.    Your
     outgoing mail,  which may  well be of a confidential nature,  has
     been effectively, privately and quietly "stolen."

     Most  modern  FidoNet  implementations  provide  some  method  of
     password protecting NetMail sessions.   With the packages that  I
     am personally familiar with, the protection methods are available
     and compatible with one another.

     Obviously,  the system with which you transact mail will need  to
     support session-level passwords,  and will need to have the  same
     password  implemented  on  both  ends.    This  requires  advance
     planning on the  part of both sides,  and some synchronization of
     "cutover" times.

     Security  is  a smaller concern with systems with which you  only
     sporadically transact mail.   The chances of someone knowing  the
     information  and timing required are very slim.   There has  been
     talk   about  implementing  some  sort  of   public/private   key
     encryption  system  within  FidoNet.   This would be  nice,   but
     normally  systems don't send mail on a regular basis except to  a
     handful  of  other systems.   Sufficient protection is  currently
     afforded by existing password protection schemes.

     With so many systems operating continuous mail,  mail doesn't sit
     around as much as it used to.  This reduces risk, but it does NOT
     eliminate it.   In addition,  in most cases the worst damage that
     can occur is that the perpetrator snags an EchoMail packet,   but
     occasionally, personal mail can also fall into the wrong hands.

     Implementing  password   protection  of  NetMail   sessions  with
     regularly  contacted  systems is simple and painless.   The  work
     involved  is easily offset by the peace of mind that will  result
     from  knowing  that  your  mail is  much  safer  protected  by  a
     password, rather than open and available to a "cracker."

     One  of  the  keys  to successful  passwording  is  changing  the
     password periodically.   Doing so reduces the chance that someone
     casually attempting to "guess"  the password will be  successful.
     Make the password something cryptic, not something common.  Use a
     random array of characters, instead of using a word or name.

     How  big is this problem?   Right now,  it's limited.   The  more
     broad-based  cases of breaching system  integrity,   viruses  and
     trojans for example, are a  much  bigger problem for FidoNet (and
     other) Sysops.   But with FidoNet awareness growing, availability
     and spread of FidoNet interfaces also growing - this problem will
     get worse before it gets better.

     Security  tools  are not provided on someone's whim.    They  are
     provided to solve real world problems.   These tools can be of no
     help if they are not used.  You may believe that you'll never get
     hit;   all it takes is once for someone to "steal"  your  private
     mail to someone else, and you'll be sold.  Protect yourself now.

     In  my  next  column,  I'll deal with two more  security  related
     issues.  See you in another couple weeks...

                      Yet Another Complicated Komment

                            by Steven K. Hoskin
                        ( STEVE HOSKIN at 1:128/11 )

                            Episode 2:  AlterNet


          Yes, I'm still beating around this old thing about AlterNet.
     I can see that there is a massive diversity of opinion about what
     to do about AlterNet and  all  that  happy  stuff, so I figured I
     might as well be  a  good  columnist  and  get  in on the action.

          AlterNet is a FidoNet  spin-off;  the  same  technology with
     new ideals in administration and  management.  Somehow, new ideas
     are never taken well and always  meet with resistance.  Even when
     they're better than whatever is currently available.

          I'm not saying AlterNet is  right.  Personally, I think they
     were wrong to leave FidoNet.    Going  multi-net is only going to
     cause problems in communication,  and  communication is what it's
     all about.  Or, at least, that's  the rose-colored picture I have
     of FidoNet.

          I base this article on  the  assumption  that we (Fido/Alter
     Net) want to communicate.    We  WANT  to  provide  services that
     include   communication   between  the  nets.    We  WANT  to  be
     reasonable.  But we're having problems.

          FidoNet is run by PolicyX  (at  time  of  writing, Policy3).
     So procedures to accomplish  this  desired  link with AlterNet is
     currently limited.  Policy3  covers  no policy concerning linking
     with other Nets;  FidoNet  is  the  highest  entity recognized by
     Policy3.

          Side note:  Perhaps  Policy4  should  recognize the World as
     the largest entity, followed by  individual Networks, followed by
     FidoNet as one of the many...

          In any case, FidoNet MUST be  run under current PolicyX.  So
     how do we communicate with AlterNet?

          Either selected individuals  will  have  to go dual-identity
     and act as "gateways", making it  fairly incumbent on the user to
     select the closest gateway to  AlterNet, or everybody in AlterNet
     will have to  go  dual  identity  as  FidoNodes,  making for some
     serious changes to  SysOp  setups.    This  would also have to be
     done by all SysOps  into  AlterNet  in  order  to  provide a FULL
     two-way communication link.

          I don't think ALL  FidoNet  SysOps  are  going to go through
     the hassle of going  dual-identity.    Besides, what happens when
     another Net breaks away?   Everybody  goes tri-identity?  I think
     not.

     FidoNews 5-09                Page 15                  29 Feb 1988


          If you read my recent article  on linking with AlterNet, you
     understand that you were reading  a dreamer's hope.  Making cheap
     calls  is  beneficial,   but   administrative  work  involved  in
     implementing that plan  isn't  something  I  see an easy fix for.
     That was merely a technical  viewpoint for others to expand upon.
     I was hoping others would  take  that  idea further, perhaps to a
     workable point in the FidoNet structure.

          There is a way I see that might make the Fido/Alter Net link
     work on that level, but it would  require cooperation of NodeList
     structure between  the  two  organizations.    A program could be
     written  (perhaps  Xlatlist   does   this  already)  to  read  in
     AlterNet's NodeList  and  convert  all  those  nodes  into a zone
     inside the FidoNet NodeList.  It COULD be done - it's TECHNICALLY
     possible.  If Policy4 permitted  it, it would be ADMINISTRATIVELY
     possible.  And then there wouldn't  be a lot of work for anybody,
     as the NodeList compilation procedures should be NEARLY automatic
     by now.  This takes a little  of  the hassle out of the link, and
     perhaps this would make it even more feasible.

          This is a technical tidbit.   But the point of my article is
     quite simply this:

          AlterNet should never  have  broken  away;  they should have
     stayed here and helped  to  clear  up  this jungle.  But they did
     break away, and I feel that  FidoNet  has a responsibility to its
     users  to   try   to  make  a  connection   to  AlterNet,  and  a
     responsibility to its  SysOps  to  make  this  connection without
     requiring a change in software  or  setup.  I feel these problems
     can be overcome, and I, for one, want to see it.
