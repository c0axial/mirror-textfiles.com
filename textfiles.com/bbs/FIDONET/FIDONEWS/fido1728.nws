                                  Doug Myers


     With apologies to The Beatles:

     Dear Sir or Madam, would you read my string
     If you don't jump in it doesn't mean a thing.
     It's a dirty ol' whine 'bout a dirty ol' man
     And his Klingon Sysop who doesn't understand.
     It's based on a bitch by a bygone fighter
     And I need an avocation, so I wanna be an Echomail Writer...


     Echomail concerns occupy Fidonet these last couple weeks.  In last
     week's article about "The PacMan," Andy Manninger reported on the
     phenomenon wherein echomail messages stop flowing in some echoes,
     only to eventually come through in massive quantities... or worse,
     never to come through to some systems at all.

     Since his article, several echo correspondents have noted these echo
     irregularities; indeed, some have even been traced to their causes
     and dealt with.  Consensus seems to be, however, that it's a
     potentially continuing problem which needs to be monitored and dealt
     with for the foreseeable future.

     Featured in this week's Fidonews are excerpts from two messages
     concerning unrelated echomail problems.  Ross Cassell reveals a
     recent breakdown in echomail distribution between the two major
     backbones and the corrective steps applied, along with notice of the
     anticipated consequences.

     Thom LaCosta explores corrective steps for unwanted echo
     acquisitions.  His proposal for use of the echomail robot to
     automate echo renewals departs from the stated "hands off" policy of
     the past, and so he seeks input from sysops worldwide (or at least
     from Zone 1, where the echolist is most widely used).


     Are these incidents the harbinger of doom and destruction for Fido
     echomail, as some are saying?  Or are we dealing with routine
     problems, amplified somehow by the recent focus of attention?

     It is of note that none of these problems are completely new.  I
     recall complaints about the irregular flow of echomail from the days
     when Fidonet was in its heyday.  Back then, people complained and
     other people acted... kinda like now.

     Breakdowns between backbones appears to be a new problem... but
     that's only because Fidonet was dominated by the NAB through most of
     its history.  If the "backbone problem" is considered a "hub
     FIDONEWS 17-28               Page 2                   10 Jul 2000


     problem," we've certainly seen and dealt with these before.

     Nor does Thom LaCosta present us with a previously unexperienced
     problem - complaints about echo hijacking have filled the ether for
     as long as I can remember.

     These problems, rather than indicating the death of Fido echomail
     instead testify to it's strength.  Though the shrinking nodelist is
     a reality and it doesn't seem to be going away, the interest in
     echomail seems stronger than ever.  This editor feels that echomail
     will survive any conceivable deterioration of Fidonet and remain
     vital so long as there are any number of active nodes.

     I once belonged to an "othernet" with only nine active nodes which
     nonetheless sported echomail bases that drew one back for more.  The
     sysops then were a lot less knowledgeable than those of Fidonet
     today, not nearly as quick to resolve problems... and yet the sense
     of community thrived.  There's no reason Fido can't pull this off -
     even if the nodelist of the future continues to shrink.

                         *Massive Dupes and Old Mail
                           Ross Cassell, 1:3639/93
                     Extracted from echomail in FIDONEWS


     Hello All!

     In light of connection issues between the Z1B and the NAB following
     Matt Bedyneks departure and a glitch with the border-gate software
     at the new bridge. Bob Seaborn was kind enough to provide me with
     archives of all the mail bundles he had that covered the time frame
     these glitches occured. His archives obviously contained mail from
     NAB fed systems that may or may not have made it into Z1B fed
     systems to be propogated.

     *HOWEVER* some mail did propogate ok and as a result many of you
     will see dupes because of the mass toss I just performed of Bobs
     archives, however this should adequately address any lost mail.

     Conversely I returned the favor to Bob Seaborn by providing him with
     what I could provide that contained mail from Z1B fed systems which
     may or may not have propogated into the NAB?

     Unfortunately I only at the time only backup for 7 days inbound mail
     prior to toss, so I could not provide him with mail that originated
     from here or from my downlinks that may not have reached the NAB..
     Nevertheless, some is better than none. I will be implementing a
     bulk backup setup when I am through here..

     At any rate, when Bob gets done tossing that care package I sent to
     him, you will likely see even more dupes... After this, the dust
     shall settle and business as usual.

     Best Regards,

                            Echo Mod Robot Updates
                             Thom LaCosta, 1:1/21
                    Extracted from Echomail in MODERATORS

     I've gotten mail from several moderators asking if I can use the
     echo mod robot to make submissions on their behalf.

     The technology works...I use it for my own echoes.  The downside is
     that if I were to take on that automation, I might renew a listing
     FIDONEWS 17-28               Page 4                   10 Jul 2000


     for a moderator who is no longer active...which is counter
     productive.

     I suppose it could be done...I'd just have to reach out and touch
     the moderator before renewal to insure that they are still online.

     So, the question might be, is that an appropriate mechanism to
     prevent the unwanted/unwarrented rescues, or do we maintain the
     present system.

     Note: there are many echoes that have MOD UPD messages submitted by
     someone other than the moderator...so the precendent has been set.

     I'd be interested in comments from yourself and others on the
     matter.

                            What Do the Kids Say?
                            Thanks to Lynn Gipson
                            lgipson@netquest.com



     Questions asked some kids:

     HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHO TO MARRY?

     "You got to find somebody who likes the same stuff. Like, if you
     like sports, she should like it that you like sports, and she should
     keep the chips and dip coming."
      Alan, age 10

     "No person really decides before they grow up who they're going to
     marry.  God decides it all way before, and you get to find out later
     who you're stuck with."
      Kirsten, age 10

     WHAT IS THE RIGHT AGE TO GET MARRIED?

     "Twenty-three is the best age because you know the person FOREVER by
     then."
      Camille, age 10

     "No age is good to get married at.  You got to be a fool to get
     married."
      Freddie, age 6

     HOW CAN A STRANGER TELL IF TWO PEOPLE ARE MARRIED?

     "Married people usually look happy to talk to other people."
      Eddie, age 6

     "You might have to guess, based on whether they seem to be yelling
     at the same kids."
      Errick, age 8

     WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR MOM AND DAD HAVE IN COMMON?

     "Both don't want no more kids."
      Lori, age 8

     WHAT DO MOST PEOPLE DO ON A DATE?

     "Dates are for having fun, and people should use them to get to know
     each other.  Even boys have something to say if you listen long
     enough."
      Lynnette, age 8

     FIDONEWS 17-28               Page 8                   10 Jul 2000


     "On the first date, they just tell each other lies, and that usually
     gets them interested enough to go for a second  date."
      Martin, age 10

     WHAT WOULD YOU DO ON A FIRST DATE THAT WAS TURNING SOUR?

     "I'd run home and play dead.  The next day I would call all the
     newspapers and make sure they wrote about me in all the dead
     columns."
      Craig, age 9

     WHEN IS IT OKAY TO KISS SOMEONE?

     "When they're rich."
      Pam, age 7

     "The law says you have to be eighteen, so I wouldn't want to mess
     with that."
      Curt, age 7

     "The rule goes like this:  if you kiss someone, then you should
     marry them and have kids with them.  It's the right  thing  to do."
      Howard, age 8

     IS IT BETTER TO BE SINGLE OR MARRIED?

     "It's better for girls to be single but not for boys. Boys need
     someone to clean up after them."
      Anita, age 9

     HOW WOULD THE WORLD BE DIFFERENT IF PEOPLE DIDN'T GET MARRIED?

     "There sure would be a lot of kids to explain, wouldn't there?"
      Kelvin, age 8

     HOW WOULD YOU MAKE A MARRIAGE WORK?

     "Tell your wife that she looks pretty even if she looks like a
     truck."
      Ricky, age 10

                             A Good and Pious Man
                              Thanks to Roy Reed

     Seymour was a good and pious man, and when he passed away, the Lord
     himself greeted him at the pearly gates of heaven.

     "Hungry, Seymour?" the Lord asked.

     "I could eat," said Seymour.  The Lord opened a can of tuna, and
     they shared it.

     FIDONEWS 17-28               Page 9                   10 Jul 2000


     While eating this humble meal, Seymour looked down into Hell and
     noticed the inhabitants devouring enormous steaks, pheasant,
     pastries and vodka.

     The next day, the Lord again asked Seymour if he were hungry, and
     Seymour again said, "I could eat."  Once again, a can of tuna was
     opened and shared, while down below Seymour noticed a feast of
     caviar, champagne, lamb, truffles, brandy and chocolates.

     The following day, mealtime arrived and another can of tuna was
     opened.  Meekly, Seymour said, "Lord, I am very happy to be in
     heaven as a reward for the good life I lived.  But, this is heaven,
     and all I get to eat is tuna.  But in the Other Place, they eat like
     Kings.  I just don't understand."

     "To be honest, Seymour," the Lord said, "for just two people, does
     it pay to cook?"

     a @ preceding an individual's name implies a virtual email
     address. The email is translated as follows
     firstlast@osirusoft.com will automatically route to the
     appropriate individual's email.  Anyone in this list will
     also receive routed notice of this feature.  In my case, it
     would still be joejared@osirusoft.com, but you get the idea.

     Also, as information is provided to me, I will be adding a
     latency field to each node, which is defined as the maximum
     time between when the message is received, and when it is
     sent on to other nodes, or available to be sent onward,
     defined in minutes. A latency of ! implies that there is an
     immediate response, and an attempt to deliver immediately
