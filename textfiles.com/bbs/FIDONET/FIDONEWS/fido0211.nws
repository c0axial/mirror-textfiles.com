        You can take this to mean anything you want, but hopefully 
        as an invitation to comment, make suggestions, or write

                             ARTICLE SUBMISSION

        All articles you see in this issue are written by users and 
        sysops, and have one way or another managed to consume disk 
        space on Fido #375. In order to get rid of them, and free up 
        my precious disk space, I include them here, then quickly 
        delete them. Then they are YOUR problem.  

        EDITORIAL CONTENT:

        Totally up to you; I publish anything at all. Articles are 
        generally Fido or BBS related; this is by no means a 
        decision on my part, nor a requirement.  

        FOR SALE, WANTED, NOTICES:

        Pretty much self explanatory. Commercial ads are welcomed,

        Manage to get a copy of your article to Fido #375, 
        preferably by Fidonet mail, or by uploading.  The name of 
        the file you send MUST have one of the following extensions:

        ARTICLE FORMAT: VERY IMPORTANT! PLEASE READ!

        The requirements are a little tighter in this department, 
        due to purely practical constraints.  I cannot devote hours 
        to converting every text format in the world to the one I 
        use.  

        1.  NO LEFT MARGINS! Flush left please.  We will do the 
            indenting at our end, thank you.  

        2.  RIGHT MARGIN AT COLUMN 60 OR LESS! Less is OK, more is 
            definitely not. This includes fancy boxes, dotted lines, 
            etc.  

        3.  NO FUNNY CHARACTERS!  This includes formfeeds and other 
            oddities.  

        4.  NO GRAPHIC CHARACTERS! Believe it or not, not every one 
            in the world has an IBM PC. My computer understands 
            printable characters from 20 hex to 7e hex. (Space to 
            tilde) This is ASCII; "American Standard Code for 
            Information Interchange". We are "Interchanging 
            Information". Everything else is GARBAGE. ASCII is 
            universal; Graphics are not.  

        5.  TOTAL ARTICLE LENGTH: Up to you; note, however, that I 
            will probably avoid publishing dictionaries, bibles 
            translated into NAPLPS, and ASCII encoded LANDSAT 
            pictures of Russian wheat farms.  

        6.  WHERE ON EARTH IS THIS ARTICLE FROM? Well ... good 
            question! A good idea to identify yourself somewhere, 
            unless you wish to remain anonymous. Thats okay too, but 
            I may balk at publishing rude or otherwise racy 
            submissions.  

        7.  You don't need to put in separator lines at the top or 
            bottom.  They are added automatically when Fidonews is 
            assembled.  

        Any article that doesn't meet the above criteria will get 
        bounced, and will not be published until someone gets around 
        to fixing it.  I might go over it and fix it up in time for 
        the next issue, or I might ask you to try again, or I might 
        just forget about it.  In any event, you must meet these 
        standards if you expect your article to be published 
        promptly.

        Fidonews is a bit on the large side this week.  At the last 
        minute Tom Jennings sent me a file by Bruce Webster of BYTE 
        Magazine.  I'm not sure if it was meant as an article, but 
        it's topical and pressing, so here it is.

        In brief, some legislation is pending in California that is 
        of direct concern to sysops of bulletin boards everywhere, 
        since it may well end up serving as model legislation for 
        other states.  We all owe our thanks to Bruce on this one, 
        since he's been spending his own time and money working with 
        the congresscritters to revise the bill into something I 
        think we can all live with.  

        He also makes a very valid point; we can't afford to just 
        sit around and ignore what's going on around us.  I suggest 
        that we should form our own Political Action Committee to 
        protect our interests.  Not being very political myself, I 
        have no idea how one goes about doing such things, but I'm 
        sure we must have people out there who do.  Can anybody help 
        on this?  Or does anyone know anyone who can help?  At the 
        very least, I'd like to see an article in the near future on 
        how we would go about it.

        We have lot's of other goodies this issue, including a 
        review of sorts from TJ about the Hayes 2400 baud modem, and 
        how it will work with Fido 10H.

        ============================================================
                                  NEWS
        ============================================================
        The following information deals with California Senate Bill 
        1012, introducted by Sen. John Doolittle (R-Citrus Heights).  

        SB 1012:  An act to amend Section 502 of the Penal Code, 
        relating to computers.  

        Under existing law, the malicious access, alteration, 
        deletion, damage, destruction or disruption of a computer 
        system, network, program, or data is a public offense and a 
        felony.  Existing law also sets forth a separate category of 
        public offenses involving the unauthorized access to a 
        computer system, computer network, computer program, or 
        data, punishable as specified, depending upon whether there 
        is injury.  

        This bill would add a new category of offenses involving the 
        unauthorized placement of personal or private information on 
        a computer bulletin board, as defined.  A violation of this 
        offense would be classified as a public offense punishable 
        in the same manner as unauthorized access is punishable 
        under current law.  

        SB 1012 would add the following paragraphs to Section 502 of 
        the Penal Code: 

        (a)(2)  "Computer bulletin board" means a service, accessed 
                through the use of a computer, for the storage or 
                dissemination of information to the public.  

        (e)(1)  Any person who knowingly places a telephone number 
                or address not listed in a public telephone 
                directory, personal identification number, computer 
                password, access code, credit card number, debit 
                card number, bank account number, or other personal 
                or private information of another on a computer 
                bulletin board or otherwise makes the information 
                available electronically to the public without the 
                prior written authorization by the owner of the 
                information is guilty of a public offense.  

           (2)  Any owner or operator of a computer bulletin board 
                who knowingly permits the maintenance of a telephone 
                number or address not listed in a public telephone 
                directory, personal identification number, computer 
                password, access code, credit card number, debit 
                card number, bank account number, or other personal 
                or private information of a person other than the 
                owner of the information on a computer bulletin 
                board or otherwise makes the information available 
                electronically to the public, once having been 
                notified that it is private information, without the 
                prior written authorization by the owner of the 
                information, is guilty of a public offense.

        History of SB 1012:

        07 Mar 1985   Introduced by Sen. John Doolittle
        16 Apr 1985   Amended by Sen. Doolittle's office
                      Passed unanimously by the Senate Judiciary 
                      Committee 

        Steps yet to come:

        1) Approval by the Senate Finance Committee 
        2) Approval by the entire Senate (majority vote) 
        3) Introduction into the Assembly 
        4) Approval by two Assembly committees [I'm not sure if it 
           must also be approved by the entire Assembly] 
        5) Resolution of discrepancies (if any) between the Senate 
           and Assembly versions 
        6) Signature by the Governor 
        7) Becomes law six months (I believe) after signature 

                     *** My involvement in all this ***

        I learned of this bill Sunday (14 Apr 85) through two 
        different BBS messages, discovering that it was to come 
        before the committee on Tuesday (16 Apr).  I immediately 
        sent a letter (via MCI Mail) to Sen. Bill Lockyer (Chairman 
        of the Senate Judiciary Committee) expressing my concern 
        over what I had heard about SB 1012.  On Monday (15 Apr), I 
        spend a good part of the afternoon on the phone, talking 
        with staff people in the offices of all the members of the 
        Judiciary Committee and (again) registering my oppposition 
        based on what I knew.  In the process, I talked with Ted 
        Blanchard in Sen.  Doolittle's office (Doolittle is also on 
        the committee); Blanchard was very helpful and, when he 
        found out I was planning to fly up to testify against the 
        bill in committee, ask me to stop by and work with him on 
        the wording.  I agreed.  I then spent the rest of the 
        evening preparing formal letters of oppostion for each 
        member of the committee.  

        I flew up late Tuesday morning and spent an hour or two 
        delivering the letters to each committee member (or, more 
        precisely, to their secretaries).  I then met with 
        Blanchard, who was understanding of my concerns and frankly 
        ask me to sit down and help him rewrite the bill.  We were 
        later joined by Don Ingraham, assistant D.A. from Alameda 
        County [Oakland], and another person, a consultant from the 
        State Office of Information Technology.  We then spent a few 
        hours hammering out different changes in the bill.  Ingraham 
        was very sympathetic towards the vast majority of BBS's and 
        did not want wording that would allow harrassment of those 
        sysops.  He just wanted something that would let him nail 
        (or, at least, threaten into closing down) the "bastard 
        boards" that publish lists of credit card numbers, corporate 
        computer access codes, and the like, which he currently 
        can't touch under existing law.  [Point of interest:  while 
        he was obviously trying to be "professional" by not 
        criticizing other agencies, it became clear under repeated 







FIDONEWS     --           29 Apr 85  00:00:56           Page 6

        questioning that he thought the Tcimpidis arrests should 
        never have taken place, and that the L.A. City Attorney's 
        office had made a *big* mistake (my words, not his).] 

        The major changes in wording came in paragraph (e)(2), 
        dealing with sysops.  The original bill had the phrase 
        "knowingly permits the placement" (instead of "maintenance") 
        and did *not* have the clause, "once having been notified 
        that it is private information".  As it was, Ingraham felt 
        that the original wording would have put the burden of proof 
        on the D.A., not on the sysop, but we all agreed that these 
        changes benefitted both the sysops and the D.A.'s, since (1) 
        the sysop could not be held liable unless someone pointed 
        out the existence of the message and the sysop took no steps 
        to remove it, and (2) the D.A. can get a cleaner case when 
        the sysop *is* guilty by being able to show that (a) the 
        sysop was notified, and (b) the message was still up 
        sometime later.   Other, more minor changes were or had been 
        made, such as the addition of the phrase "not listed in a 
        public telephone directory".  

        The bill (with the modifications) came before the Judiciary 
        Committee around 5:30 p.m.  No opposition came forward (I 
        had agreed not to oppose the bill as modified), and it was 
        passed unanimously.  As mentioned above, it still has to go 
        through a number of committees in both houses, and has to 
        pass by majority vote in (at least) the Senate before 
        becoming law.  

        I still have some reservations about the bill, which mostly 
        center around two issues:  first, the interpretation of the 
        phrase "personal or private information", which is a little 
        too open ended for my tastes, and second, the interpretation 
        of the word "maintenance", in other words, just how quickly 
        the sysop must delete an offending message once he/she has 
        been notified that it is "private information" to avoid 
        being guilty of "maintaining" it.  However, Sen. Doolittle's 
        office appears to be very eager to get feedback from the BBS 
        community, and we may be able to get more acceptable 
        language into it.  There is still a long road ahead before 
        SB 1012 becomes law.  

        I suspect that I may get some flack from some of you out 
        there in BBS-land for working with Doolittle's office to 
        modify the bill rather than taking a die-hard stand against 
        it.  My response:  go fly a kite.  *I* was there; you 
        weren't.  I spent nearly $200 out of my own pocket to fly up 
        to Sacramento and back, so that I could have some say in the 
        bill.  And that doesn't count the cost for an hour or two of 
        prime time phone conversations between San Diego and 
        Sacramento.  You know how many other people showed up, out 
        of all the concerned, outraged sysops and users?  None.  
        Zero.  Zip.  Peggy Watt, formerly of InfoWorld and now with 
        CommunicationsWeek, was there, not to change or protest the 
        bill, but to cover the hearing, but she was the only other 
        computer-type person to appear.  I can't take credit for all 
        the changes made--the "public telephone directory" addition 







FIDONEWS     --           29 Apr 85  00:00:58           Page 7

        came as a result of a phone call on Monday by Mark Welch--
        but I can sure take credit for the rest.  

        Furthermore, had I refused to work with Doolittle's office 
        (and he and his staff were by no means the ogres pictured in 
        some of the BBS messages I saw) but had just tried to oppose 
        the bill in committee, I probably wouldn't have gotten 
        anywhere.  You see, when the bill finally did come up, not 
        one single member of the Judiciary Committee said anything 
        to oppose it.  This suggests that very few of you took the 
        time to find out who the committee members were (as I did) 
        and to call or visit their offices (as I did).  

        In short, if you didn't make some real effort to change the 
        bill or block its approval by the committee, then you have 
        no right to harp on me and my efforts.  And if you're still 
        not satisfied with the bill, well, there's still a lot of 
        time left to change it.  Just pick up the phone and start 
        dialing.  Ted Blanchard, in Sen. Doolittle's office, can be 
        reached at (916) 445-5788.  Or, if you prefer the mail, you 
        can write him c/o the Sen. Doolittle, State Capitol, 
        Sacramento, CA  95814.  And if you still don't do anything, 
        then you had better be prepared to live with what you get.  

        My apologies if I sound a tad defensive, but I was irritated 
        by the tremendous lack of action on the part of the BBS 
        community, and I was frankly scared at what would have gone 
        through had *I* not spent the time and money.  I'll be 
        damned if I'm going to take any guff for doing *something* 
        when no one else was willing to do much of anything.  

        By the way, while I was up there, I got a list of *all* 
        bills currently floating around the capitol dealing with 
        computers.  A number of them also have implications for us.  
        Maybe we'd better wake up and make sure that our interests 
        are represented there on a regular basis.  If I can figure 
        out how to afford it, I may start trying to make monthly 
        visits to Sacramento to work directly with the people making 
        the laws.  Some of you might consider doing the same.  

        Nothing like a close call to get one excited, eh?

                        Software and Disk Swapping
                             by Robert Briggs
                           SYSOP FIDO node #464

                 I  don't  know  about the rest of the  nodes  out 
        there, but I spend a tremendous amount of money dialing up 
        various  other BBS systems in my endless pursuit  for  the 
        perfect (read that "another") piece of software.  It seems 
        to  me  that there is a way to reduce my  $406.00  monthly 
        phone  bill  by a considerable amount and still  obtain  a 
        great  deal of new software each month.   I am looking for 
        some  other  nodes that are interested in  doing  both  as 
        well. 

             My idea is not new, it was at one time practiced by a 
        number of user groups (and  may be still, for all I know).  
        It  is simple and really quite inexpensive,  amounting  to 
        maybe  a few dollars worth of postage per month.   I  will 
        circulate a box of diskettes per every ten nodes that care 
        to  join in.   I will fill one of the 10 diskettes up with 
        software that I think is interesting,  and mail the box to 
        the  next node on the route list.   The next node will  do 
        the same,  after taking anything from my diskette that the 
        SYSOP  finds  interesting.   He will then fill a  diskette 
        with  software  and mail the box to the next node  on  the 
        list.   When the box gets back to me,  there will be 9 new 
        diskettes  of software to examine.   I will copy  anything 
        that  I find interesting,  put different software  on  the 
        diskette  assigned  to me,  and once again mail it to  the 
        next  node  on  the list,  who will in  turn  find  9  new 
        diskettes of software,  copy anything interesting,  refill 
        his assigned diskette with software, etc.

             The  first time around,  the first few  nodes  really 
        don't  see  much  in  the way  of  software  - just  blank 
        diskettes.   AFTER  the first time  around,  however,  any 
        given  node  should see 9 new diskettes of  software  each 
        month.   (Maybe  more - if several boxes of diskettes  are 
        being circulated, cross-routing the boxes could produce 18 
        or  27  new diskettes each month -- at 360k per  diskette, 
        that would amount to 6.5 or 9.7 MEGABYTES of new  software 
        each month!)

             The  problem with this scheme is that it  depends  on 
        SYSOP's being reliable enough to mail the diskettes to the 
        next  node  on the list,  and in timely enough fashion  to 
        keep  the diskettes (and software) flowing  smoothly  from 
        one node to another.   This means that ONLY nodes that are 
        interested  and committed enough should get involved.   IF 
        you  are  interested in this form  of  software  exchange, 
        please contact me via FIDONET and leave your node  number, 
        name,  address,  and  the  type of software that  you  are 
        interested in.  If enough nodes contact me, I will start a 
        box of diskettes around immediately.

                              FIDO RE-WRITE
                             by Robert Briggs
                           SYSOP FIDO node #464

        An  open  letter  in response to  various  inquiries  from 
        various nodes... 

           Being  of  the engineering persuasion rather  than  the 
        marketing  or  sales  persuasion,  I don't  think  that  a 
        "marketing  survey" is of much use to the  FIDO  area.   I 
        think  that it would cost a bundle and that there would be 
        very few replies.   I at least would not attempt to handle 
        such a survey for lack of $$$$.  

           Having  been  many things in the 14 years that  I  have 
        been in the computer field,  including V.P. of engineering 
        of  several  companies,  project librarian  for  a  "super 
        programmer" team,  and most of the time just serving as  a 
        systems  analysist,  I have to disagree on having  several 
        nodes  serve  as  repository  for the  source.   It  is  a 
        difficult  job to keep large amounts of source code  under 
        control in one location,  much less several.  I agree with 
        your fears about "keeping all of your eggs in one basket", 
        i.e.  perhaps having the node responsible for handling the 
        source code get tired of the whole business and just  drop 
        out.

           My   node  may  not  be  ideally  located,   but  I  am 
        volunteering  for  the job.   I guess that IF  there  were 
        three nodes that could and would work together, and agreed 
        to  share files,  ideas,  and could keep everything  under 
        control,  then the ideal situation might be to have a node 
        on the East coast,  West coast,  and somewhere in between.  
        Experience  shows me that this would,  in all  likelyhood, 
        not work out.

           I  do agree that there are any number of features  that 
        could be incorporated into a re-work of FIDO,  perhaps too 
        many.   I think that the first step should be to duplicate 
        what  FIDO currently is,  while keeping in mind what  FIDO 
        might become in the future.   This is no small undertaking 
        - I suspect that just re-writing FIDO to its current level 
        may take the equivalent of several man years.

           RBBS has a central location for changes/updates.  While 
        many  of  its users customize the  program,  any  released 
        changes come from only one source,  and I think that  this 
        might  be  the  best way to handle things at  the  present 
        time.  I almost dread the thought of hundreds of different 
        versions of FIDO floating around....

            A possible solution to this might be to make FIDO more 
        flexible to start with.  The most powerful BBS system that 
        I every saw was one called TBBS,  which ran on Radio Shack 
        computers.   It was menu driven,  and by changing just the 
        menu files,  not the actual program,  you could make it do 
        almost  anything.   It  had 255 different  privilege  (the

        correct  spelling!) levels,  and everyone  with  different 
        levels could,  at the SYSOPS discretion, see what appeared 
        to be a completely different BBS,  complete with different 
        menus, different message areas, and different file areas.

        From:  Robert E. Spivack
               Fido #346
               (408) 972-8164

        [--Although I have written an article or two, and a for
        sale message, I should introduce myself and let you 
        know that I am the SYSOP of Fido #346 in San Jose, 
        California.  

        Currently, I run Fido as a semi-private system validating
        users after they dial in once.  I do this mainly to keep
        out the lookers, anyone willing to leave their name and
        dial back in a day is welcome.  I also do this to keep the
        number of users small intentionally.  Since San Jose has
        other Fido's and RBBS, etc. I don't want my system to   
        become another download garbage trap.  Also, a small 
        number of users means I can use my own system without
        upsetting a lot of people who would say my system is too
        busy, they can never get on.

        Since my own interests are rather technical, I am devoting
        my Fido to the theme of "Much ado about the PC AT".  Thus,
        if you have any special patches, files, or comments (pro
        or con) about the IBM PC AT, it might be worth a
        long-distance phone call (or FidoNet message).]

        Back to the main topic of this article....
        I think the changes underway for FidoNet are quite
        interesting.  I hope the final thought process that goes
        into the node/region/admin stuff takes into account the
        possibility that in the future local sub-nets of Fido
        might be linked on some kind of wide-band lan.

        Computers like numbers, humans like words. Any chance of
        using names (even if they have to be aliased to underlying
        numbers) for the regions?

        Finally, the only real request I have:  I do wish the 
        process of compiling nodelists (no matter how they are
        generated) have some sort of incremental update built-in.

        I sure would like to be able to download a 65 KB file 
        only once, and then apply 5 or 10 kb updates to it.  Maybe
        once every 3 months issue a complete new file with
        incrementals every week in between.  Given that admins/and
        hosts exist, it would always be possible for each region to
        have both a completely updated full file (for new sysops) and
        the proper set of incrementals to roll forward an older list.

        Comments?

        Fido #1
        27 Apr 85

                        HAYES SMARTMODEM 2400 REVIEW

                This is sort of a review of the Hayes Smartmodem 
        2400. I say sort of because it's more or less documentation 
        on what I went through to make it work with Fido/FidoNet and 
        other things.  

                The Hayes 2400 supports 300, 600, 1200 and 2400 
        baud, and Bell 103A, 212A, and CCITT modes. I won't even 
        bother to mention all the permutations. It has a much 
        extended command set, and is supposed to be compatible with 
        the "old" 1200 baud Hayes. It almost is.  

                This modem has many problems. Most are plain old 
        "bugs" that will probably get fixed, others are just design 
        problems. I don't think Hayes is going to be prepared for 
        the flak they will get on the changes they made. They might 
        have thought them inconsequential.  

                They did a good job with the extended command set.  
        Old commands haven't been changed, they added new ones or 
        expanded existing ones. So far, so good.  

                Most of the problems are caused by optionitis. There 
        are just too many useless commands. Luckily, most can be 
        ignored. Two that cannot be are &D and &C. These are "one 
        time" initialization commands the control how CD (Carrier 
        Detect) and DTR (Data Terminal Ready) work.  

                There are many non-obvious subtlies in getting the 
        damn thing to answer the phone at 2400 baud. It won't just 
        do it, you have to initialize it in a very special way. The 
        problem is this non volatile RAM used instead of the DIP 
        switches. You will soon wish you had DIP switches again. The 
        NVRAM saves just about everything, including the last used 
        baud rate. Hayes went crazy saving things in this RAM, and 
        to show how much they like it they keep reading things back 
        from it even after you have changed things.  

                For instance, to get the modem to autoanswer at 2400 
        baud, you have to send AT commands to it at 2400 baud. Not 
        1200. Then, save the state of things with &W, so it will 
        remember that you used 2400. Whenever DTR is dropped and 
        raised, it will "remember" these settings, even if you don't 
        want to. Fido 10H does this automatically, but for other 
        programs you will probably have to go in with Minitel or 
        something at 2400 baud and do it yourself.  

                An annoyance, though I see why they did it, is that 
        the numeric result code for "CONNECT 2400" is "10". The old 
        Hayes had single digit result codes, like "1" meant 
        "CONNECT" (300), "5" means "CONNECT 1200", etc. Programs 
        that look for a single digit will think the "10" is "1".  







FIDONEWS     --           29 Apr 85  00:01:11           Page 14


                The &D3 command looks useful, but is not. It causes 
        the modem to go onhook and disable when DTR is dropped, and 
        reload all settings from NVRAM. This is fine, except that in 
        this modem, when DTR is held low, CD is set true even if 
        there is no carrier. Not very useful on a Fido or other BBS 
        environment.  

                There is no way to support DTR properly, and NOT 
        have the modem autoanswer. In my application, I run a Fido 
        only for outgoing mail on my home phone; I do not want the 
        modem to autoanswer! As soon as DTR is lowered and raised, 
        it goes into autoanswer, even if I set ATS0=0 and save it 
        with &W. It insists on always setting ATS0=1.  

                Since the 2400 supports 1200 in either CCITT or Bell 
        modes, there has to be some way to tell the modem which to 
        use. Enter the B command. However, it doesn't seem to work, 
        and certainly doesnt work like they say, though the "bug" is 
        actually an improvement. Calling another 2400 Smartmodem 
        always connects, so I cannot tell which mode it's using.  

                ATB0 is supposed to be CCITT mode. The manual says 
        you will get an ERROR if you try to dial, etc at 300 baud in 
        CCITT mode. This is not true, it will connect as Bell 103A.  
        This is an improvement over what is in the manual. Same is 
        true in Bell mode, ABT1. Supposedly, it won't let you dial 
        in Bell mode at 2400; not true, it switches to CCITT and 
        works fine. net result: ATBx is a no-op.  

                600 baud is a total failure in the model I have. It 
        connects OK, but it drops characters and bits. Presumably 
        this is just a bug that will get fixed.  

                Two of us had a similar, non-repeatable problem at 
        2400 baud; the modem "locked up" and went into one of its 
        Test Modes, with the MR light blinking. Disconnecting seemed 
        to cure it. It only happened once to each of us.  

                The manual, while about as clear as the old one, is 
        many revisions behind the software actually in the modem.  
        (The product code from my modem, returned by ATI, is 242) It 
        does not even mention the side effects and interactions of 
        DTR, NVRAM, and baud rate. Some things, like ATBx, are just 
        plain wrong. Be prepared to experiment.  

        SUMMARY:

                Overall, once you figure out how to operate the damn 
        thing, it works quite well, the 2400 baud problem 
        notwithstanding. In autoanswer mode, once properly set up, 
        it will receive calls at 2400 CCITT, 1200 CCITT, 1200 Bell 
        212A, 600 CCITT (maybe) and 300 Bell 103A. Not too shabby.  
        You just have to be very careful as to how you issue 
        commands, and remember to do it at the right baud rates. For 
        a more or less unattended operation such as Fido and 
        FidoNet, there is no problem, since Fido will do the work

        for you.  

                Assuming they fix the small bugs, this should be an 
        excellent modem. The only drawback is the complexity coupled 
        with the strange side effects such as not answering at 2400 
        as mentioned above. Most users won't want to pay for all the 
        unneccessary goodies such as synchronuous mode, and there 
        may be other modems out that have less features but cost a 
        lot less. Time will tell. It works quite well.  

        OTHER STUFF:

                There may be a special deal from Hayes for FidoNet 
        sysops. Don't ask yet, it will get announced if true. There 
        are also U.S. Robotics 2400 baud jobs coming too, supposedly 
        for $350.00. It supports 2400 CCITT, 1200 Bell 212A, and 300 
        Bell 103A. Basically, a Hayes 1200 with 2400 added. This may 
        end up being the hot modem, if it works as advertised. In 
        any case, don't expect all these things to be compatible 
        with each other; I already know of differences between the 
        Hayes and USR 2400 models, though the differences shouldn't 
        be fatal.  

        FIDO SPECIFIC ISSUES:

                Fido 10H supports 300, 600, 1200 and 2400 baud. You 
        have to hit CR twice for all baud rates. There is a problem 
        at 2400 though. Sometimes the first CR doesnt get noticed; 
        its not a modem problem, it's just a side effect of how 
        UARTs work, and there is such a pressing need to release 10H 
        that it will have to go out as is for now.  

                To connect to a Fido with a 2400 baud modem, try the 
        usual CRs. If no results, try hitting the space bar, then a 
        CR.  

        HOW TO MAKE IT WORK:

                To make CD and DTR work as in the older Hayes, do 
        the following: 

        Use a terminal program, at 2400 baud.

        AT&D2           DTR control
        AT&C1           CD control
        Other commands as needed; V0, E0, etc
        AT&W            Save changes in NVRAM

                You have to set &D and &C before you use the modem 
        with Fido. The problem is that the modem defaults to "fake" 
        CD, and Fido will think there is an incoming call, and not 
        initialize the modem. Chicken and egg type problem. Just do: 

        AT&C1&D3&W

                At any baud rate, then Fido will do the rest if you 
        select the right modem type.

                Note that if you connect once at, say, 300 baud, in 
        order for the modem to later connect at 2400 baud you MUST 
        drop DTR to make the modem reset itself from NVRAM. +++ ATH0 
        won't do it. This is most annoying. This is only an issue 
        for other autoanswer situations, not Fido.

        David Heron, Sysop, Space Coast Fido #457, Titusville, Fl

        Pat Travers, a local Florida rock musician has a song titled 
        "BOOM, BOOM OUT GO THE LIGHTS".  In the true spirit of the 
        space coast, we've decided to ask Pat to write us a special 
        version called "BOOM, BOOM IN COMES THE SHUTTLE".  

        This is due to the wonderful double-barrel sonic boom the 
        shuttle creates as it makes its landing approach.  Just 
        imagine that you are sound asleep at 7:15 some morning (for 
        those of you who never are, adjust the time for the worst) 
        and all of a sudden BOOM BOOM everything in the house 
        rattles and you shoot a foot straight up off the bed (it's 
        worse when you have a waterbed, the tidal waves can be 
        rather large).  The first thought is that some crazy 
        neighbor is out hunting in your back yard.  Then you 
        remember the block at the top of yesterday's TODAY 
        newspaper, SHUTTLE LANDING: Tommorrow no earlier than 7:13 
        AM.  

        Oh well you didn't really want to go downtown and watch it 
        approach the runway anyway.  

        The landing of Discovery, Friday 19-April-1985 was marred by 
        several incidents.  

        The wind patterns that day caused the ship to wander across 
        the runway like a bouncing ball.  In an attempt to slow down 
        and keep to the center line, the pilot managed to lock the 
        starboard breaking system, thereby blowing out 2 tires.  
        Upon inspection, all of the tires on the landing gear were 
        found to be damaged by the rough landing.  Most of the 30" 
        tires will have to be replaced before Discovery's next 
        launch.  

        Another development was a gaping hole in the port side 
        thermal insulation.  Located at the juncture of the wing and 
        the main body near the elevons, the hole led into the honey-
        comb interior of the wing.  NASA scientists are 
        investigating the possibility that the hole was created by 
        the loss of a tile at launch.

                                 OUR MISTAKE

        In the last issue of Fidonews (vol 2, num 10), both Tom 
        Jennings and Racter misspelled Ezra Shapiro's name.  It does 
        not now, and never did, have a "c" in it.

        My apologies to Ezra for letting this slip through.
