     Greetings,

     This is a short very short note from, as I'm not feeling well
     today.  Flu is the cause.

     Did the Z1C election take place?

     Happy reading.

     FTSC biannual report
     By Colin Turner, 2:2/20, ct@ftsc.org

     At the end of June my term as FTSC Administrator had been running for
     six months. I have therefore chosen this time to write an article into
     FidoNews reporting FTSC business.

     For those of you that don't know what the FTSC is, it is the FidoNet
     Technical Standards Committee. It is our job to attempt to document
     current technical practice within FidoNet (and also in the wider
     context of FidoNet Technology Networks (FTNs)). A more detailed
     explanation of our responsibilities can be found in our charter,
     document FTA-1000. Details on how to retrieve this and other FTSC
     documents can be found in another article below.

     First of all I'd like to discuss some of what we've done in the last
     few months.

     * We have constructed a new FTSC website which provides access to the
       whole family of current FTSC documents. This is to be found at the
       domain name of www.ftsc.org, which was newly purchased for the
       committee. Considerable further enhancements are planned for this
       site, but other tasks are taking precedence.

     * Similarly, an anonymous ftp server for FTSC documents can be found
       at ftp.ftsc.org.

     * Similarly, every FTSC member has been given an email address in the
       ftsc.org domain, in order to make members more accessible.

     * A list of mirror sites (for FidoNet) from which FTSC documents can
       be obtained as been created. Please contact me if you would like to
       be added.

     * A "Road Map" for the technical documents has been created. We
       understand that many proposals are de facto standards, and we hope
       to correct that problem soon. In the meantime, it's essential that
       new developers can determine which documents they should consult.

       To facilitate this, a Road Map document has been produced, listing
       the most important documents in each of several fields.

     * Several new product codes have been allocated and published.

     * Some new FSP documents have been released, specifically
             FSP-1010 - Via control line;
             FSP-1011 - BinkP protocol;
             FSP-1012 - InterNet nodelist flags.

     * The FTS documents are under review, with the production of
             FTS-5000 - Main Nodelist format;
     FIDONEWS 16-28               Page 3                   12 Jul 1999


             FTS-5001 - Nodelist flags,
       which obsolete FTS-0005.
       Additionally a discussion document detailing the various Type 2
       Packet formats has been produced which will eventually spawn the
       new standard documents for these.

     * We have reviewed two existing FSP documents and found that we cannot
       recommend them for promotion to FTS documents. These have been
       placed in the FRL (Reference Library) sequence. We have also
       included detailed adjudications of why these decisions were taken.

     * Further work and discussion has occured on fields such as Document
       Submission Requirements, and how "kludge" or "control lines" should
       be documented in future. Even the structure of the committee and how
       it might be streamlined has been discussed. It's quite possible that
       the public (in FTSC_PUBLIC) will be asked to vote on several of
       these issues in the near future.

     The public feedback in the FTSC_PUBLIC conference has been both
     gratifying and helpful, and I would invite other nodes to consider
     reading and contributing to this conference.

     Next, I'd like to deal with what I anticipate will take place in the
     next few months.

     * Further review of the existing FTS documents.

     * Discussion of several FSP documents with decisions made to elevate
       them to standards, or relegate them to the Reference Library.

     * Year 2000 tests of "critical" FTN subsystems, such as nodelist
       generation.

       Unfortunately, although many nodes and developers downloaded the
       FTSC Year 2000 test set, feedback has been almost non existant.
       The committee itself has limited time with which to run tests and so
       we will limit ourselves to what we regard as the most critical
       programs.

       I hope to make a full report on this by the end of August.

     * The elected terms of many members will expire at the end of
       September this year. Therefore election procedures will be put in
       place in time so that those members being reelected can do so
       without interruption of work.

       Of course we will also be looking for applications from new members.
       If you feel you would like to join the committee, and could
       contribute positively to its work, then please contact me for
       details now so you will be well informed when the election comes
       around.

     I would personally like to thank the members of the committee for
     their hard work, good debates and support. I would also like to thank
     all those nodes, points and others who have taken the time to provide
     input in FTSC_PUBLIC or otherwise.

     FTSC Frequently Asked Questions
     by Colin Turner, 2:2/20, ct@ftsc.org

     Here are some Frequently Asked Questions (and answers) concerning
     the FTSC.

     * How do I join the FTSC?

       The FTSC is an elected body, and you can only be appointed in this
       way.

       Elections are held periodically. You can ask in FTSC_PUBLIC when
       the next election is likely to be. Keep watching FTSC_PUBLIC and
       FidoNews for announcements.


     * How do I suggest my own new standard?

       Any point or node can suggest a new standard. You should read
       FTA-1002 and to a lesser extent FTA-1001, FTA-1006 and FTA-1007.
       After that you should know all you need to, but you can always
       contact the FTSC administrator to clarify any problems.


     * Where do I find the development information I need?

       Experienced developers can find the information they require on
       the FTSC Archive site:

       WWW
         http://www.ftsc.org

       FTP
         ftp://ftp.ftsc.org

       FidoNet 2:443/13.0 and 2:443/14.0

       A list of mirrors is also available.

       Beginners might find it useful to look at the RoadMap project to
       help them find the documents of interest.


     * How can I contact the FTSC?

       The FTSC can be contacted in a variety of ways.

     by the FTSC channel itself).

     -----------------------------------------------------------------


     Censorship of FidoNet in Russia?


     My suspicion has been aroused that Soviet-era-type censorship may
     still be continuing in Russia. The following gave rise to this
     suspicion.

     In 1996 I carried on extensive netmail correspondence with a person
     in Moscow. At some point he made critical remarks about Russian
     politicians. Soon after this our correspondence stopped. I heard no
     more from him, and my netmail to him went unanswered.

     Until recently we carried on a fairly active correspondence with
     people in Russia via the ENGLISH_TUTOR echo. Then some critical
     comments were made about Russia's role in the Kosovo crisis, and all
     of our Russian correspondents suddenly fell silent. I've since
     received netmail from one of them, complaining that no more messages
     are showing up in ENGLISH_TUTOR over there. This despite the fact
     that there are messages in this echo from North America and Europe.

     The above is insufficient to establish that the spiritual heirs of
     the former Soviet KGB are monitoring and censoring FidoNet in Russia,
     but it is enough to arouse such a suspicion.
     To help me settle this question, I'm writing this to ask the other
     users of FidoNet whether they have had similar experiences in
     communicating with Russians. If so, I would like to receive
     FIDONEWS 16-28               Page 8                   12 Jul 1999


     documentation of such experiences by netmail or e-mail along with
     suggestions on how to combat such odious Russian censorship. I think
     it's worth the effort to settle this question one way or another.
