     Sysop - Keith Hasson


     Fellow Bowlers,

             I have been bowling for 3 years now  and have
     seen many bowling league secretary programs used, some
     commercial & some Public Domain. I have been  working
     on one of my own because I feel that I can  develop a
     program much better than those available. I have  put
     onto my bbs the first version of my program.  I  have
     named it Hasson's Bowling League Secretary.

             I wanted to let people try-out what I've done
     so far and give me some feedback on what  they  think
     of it. If the responce is favorable, I  will  proceed
     in its development. The program name is BOWLEXE.EXE
     and is available for Filereq or you can sign onto my
     bbs under First & Last Name: BOWLER  Password: PIN


                                         Thank You

                            DENTIST, ANYONE?

        I've just set up a node at my dentist's office in Wheaton,
     Maryland, and I'd like to start a DENTAL echo conference.  If
     any of you have an interest in this echo, dentistry, or are
     dentists yourselves, please drop me a note in netmail.  Our system
     will also be participating in AIDS/ARC, GRAND_ROUNDS (if we
     get permission from the coordinator), RECOVERY, MENSA,
     MENSANS_ONLY, and INTERTEL.

                  EchoList - The EchoMail Conference List
                       And the New Rules Repository

     First, I wanted to spread the fact that the EchoList Moderator
     Update Instructions (ELISTMOD.ARC) have been rewritten.  My
     intent was to make them clearer and easier to understand.
     Unfortunately, I "simplified" it into twice as many pages!  Sorry
     about that, but I do get long winded.  And I put more explanatory
     detail into them, which tends to make the entire process of
     sending me a simple message look much more complex than it is.
     I'm open to critique.

     Second, I wanted to point out the one major change documented in
     those instructions:  The addition of a repository for conference
     rules in text files.  I have to credit John Tarbox from 150/3 for
     giving me the idea.

     Basically, many conferences have developed a specific set of
     rules and procedures for their participants.  Generally these get
     published within the conference itself as a message from time to
     time.  What John suggested was that people might like to know the
     rules before linking-in, and it would be a good idea to have all
     those rules available in a central place so that Sysops didn't
     have to run down several moderators to assemble the information.

     The EchoList provides a pretty generous amount of space for
     describing a conference, but I think it's necessary to keep
     things under control so that there's not too much detail given
     there (as opposed to my moderator instructions...).  I've had
     people submit lengthy, detailed policy and instructions for their
     conferences in that description field, only to have me edit it
     down to the basic "advertising" to balance it out with other
     entries.  The EchoList also has flags for certain general
     restrictions.  I'm always glad to add more, but I can't cover
     every term and condition with binary flags.  Enter: The Rules
     Repository.

     It's very simple, really.  A new moderator submission message
     format has been added that provides for submitting an attached
     file.  That file must be named xxxxxxxx.RUL, where xxxxxxxx is a
     unique abbreviation (if necessary) of the symbolic Area Name.
     The file should be a raw text file (not a word processor file,
     and not ARC'd).  What's in it?  Anything the moderator wants!
     Formatted any way he/she wants.  There are no restrictions on
     size or content.

     When my EchoList update processor finds such a message it will:
     1) note the file name in the EchoList database for reference, and
     2) ARC the .RUL file into the ELISTRUL.ARC file with all the
     other rule files.  Deleting the EchoList entry will automatically
     delete any rule file associated with that conference.  The
     ELISTRUL file will be distributed along with the ELISTnnn and
     ELISTMOD files, as well as being available for file-request or
     FidoNews 5-41                Page 5                   10 Oct 1988


     first-time user download here at 1/201.

     The only thing I don't like about this procedure is that there is
     no way for people to selectively request the rules for a specific
     conference.  You get them all.  But, it was much simpler to
     implement this way (you don't need a key to the file names to get
     the rules for a conference with a long name).  And, you always
     have to get the entire EchoList when you request it, not selected
     entries.  So, it doesn't seem too unreasonable.

     As of this writing (10/1/88) the rules file has just been
     implemented, and there is no ELISTRUL.ARC file to request!  So
     don't waste your nickel on trying to pick it up just yet.  But I
     hope this will eventually be helpful.  If you are a conference
     moderator and would like to submit an entry or rules file to the
     EchoList, please get a copy of the new Conference Listing Update
     Instructions dated 10/1/88, and have at it!

     As a reminder, the following "magic" file names (use without a
     period or file extension) are always file-requestable at 1:1/201.

        ECHOLIST  The latest Echolist, plus cross-references.
        ECHORULE  The collection of Conference Rules Files.
        ECHOMOD   The latest Moderator Update Instructions.
        ECHOPOL   The latest draft EchoMail Policy document.  (This is
                  a document being assembled by FidoNet *C's and *EC's
                  for EchoMail in general, NOT just EchoLIST policies.
                  If you have ANY interest in where EchoMail is going,
                  please read it and contribute.)


                                  Enjoy,
                           And have fun with it!

                       ON NUCLEAR POWER AND VIRUSES

     May God protect us from 'experts'. Whether they are 'experts' on
     nuclear power plants, or on computer viruses, they make our
     lives miserable by knowing _almost_ everything, but not enough.
     Then they try to run our lives accordingly.

     Fredrick L. Rice's article "To Disassemble The Machine", in
     FidoNews 5-36 (5 Sep 1988) was an interesting work of fiction. I
     highly recommend it, as it has many good, sound technical
     points. However, I wish to point out a few inaccuracies, and
     then write something along the same lines that'll knock your
     socks off -- about computer viruses.

     The problem with article is that it tells a great deal about
     the nuclear industry, but it is totally wrong in a few minor
     details. They're the critical ones. What the article
     hypothesizes about a nuclear plant accident resulting from an
     unexpectedly strong California earthquake could probably happen,
     but never to the degree that it predicts. Even worse for the
     position stated in the article, no possibility of nuclear
     explosion exists.

     One major point that the article does not discuss is that
     nuclear piping and valves are not the kind of pipes and valves
     that we are all used to. An electron-beam welding company that I
     worked for occasionally welds nuclear valves. The piping for a
     nuclear plant is rather interesting -- the pipes that these
     valves control have an inner diameter of about 3 inches. Their
     outer diameter is about 9 inches. That's right -- the walls are
     3 inches thick of pure stainless steel. I wonder if these pipes
     would even be affected by a ground-zero atomic blast, let alone
     a little 8.5-Richter earthquake.

     Even granting the possibility that these pipes _could_ break, as
     metals (especially a nuclear reactor's hydrogen-embrittled
     steels) do strange things under stress, the prospect of a
     nuclear explosion occurring in an atomic power plant is
     ludicrous.

     Let me state here that a worst-case scenario can indeed include
     hydrogen-oxygen gas explosions, core melt-down, and
     magnificently huge steam explosions. The article is technically
     correct on those points, and we avoided them by only a little
     bit at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant accident. The
     prospect of a radiation-laden steam cloud being forced out of
     nuclear plant is a very real but very low-probability threat,
     one which we should be prepared to deal with.

     But the possibility of a nuclear EXPLOSION occurring in a
     nuclear power plant does not exist. At all. First of all,
     uranium metal is never used in a commercial reactor. The Nuclear
     FidoNews 5-41                Page 7                   10 Oct 1988


     Regulatory Commission (NRC) does not allow it. Instead, the
     uranium is dispersed in ceramic. The ceramic is made into small
     pellets, each of which is so low in radioactivity that you could
     hold one in your hand with only a small amount of shielding and
     not receive any dangerous levels of radiation (not that I would
     want to, mind you!).

     Ceramic can melt, given high enough temperatures. I'll even
     grant that, in the article's scenario, the ceramic (not pure
     uranium, though!) could melt together, fuse, and heat up
     drastically, thus producing a killer cloud of atomically charged
     steam. But the differences between uranium isotopes does not
     seem to be understood. Uranium-238, which is non-radioactive, is
     the primary isotope of uranium. The fissionable isotope,
     uranium-235, appears in very small percentage in uranium. It is
     present in such small quantities that the nuclear-fuel
     manufacturers must 'enrich' the uranium that they sell with a
     little bit of uranium-235 so that the pellets will sustain a
     nuclear chain reaction. The process of separating out U-235 from
     U-238 is so difficult that it does not occur in nature.

     If a nuclear reactor is to explode in a run-away nuclear fission
     chain reaction, as some of the less-informed but more zealous
     anti-nuclear groups claim is possible, the reactor would have to
     be a fast-fission, pure-uranium fueled reactor. (It is possible
     that the reactors on nuclear-powered ships come under this
     label. I don't know, though.) Given a commercial nuclear
     reactor, with a sizeable amount of fuel, and under the worst of
     circumstances, an atomic-bomb type of explosion cannot possibly
     occur. You can check with the more reputable anti-nuclear groups
     on this.

     One more thing has been left out: The production of fissionable
     plutonium by alpha-absorbtion of U-238 atoms. (Sorry, I don't
     have a physics book on hand to look up the exact atomic number.)
     According to an engineer at the Northeast Utilities Millstone
     nuclear power plant, at the end of a fuel pellet's life, most of
     the U-235 is spent. Nearly 40 percent of the pellet's heating
     power comes from plutonium fission.

     These plutonium atoms are, again, contained in the ceramic
     matrix of the pellet. The possibility of spontaneous separation,
     refinement, and run-away nuclear fission ("atomic-bomb"
     explosion) does not exist.

     I commend the article for being a well-written piece. Problems
     with poorly-located nuclear plants have resulted both from the
     dollar greed of the power industy managements, and from
     citizens' refusal to let power plants be built in safer places
     (the old "Not In My Back Yard" or NIMBY syndrome).

     While reading "To Disassemble the Machine", I had a happy
     thought: Why not do a 'worst case' scenario about problems with
     computer viruses? Why not even take a couple of _very_ minor
     liberties with the facts, and create a scenario to put fear into
     the heart of _every_ technically competent reader? . . . . . .

     Well, I don't have to. The editors of TIME Magazine have done it
     for me -- and on the front cover, no less! They feature Computer
     Viruses on the front cover of their September 26th edition.
     Their set of articles insinuates that viruses are here, they're
     spreading fast, and that no BBS or computer network is safe.
     This issue of Time will certainly make future business for
     FidoNet quite ... interesting, shall we say? It scares the
     dickens out of _me_, that's for sure!

     Sadly, I think that this is a great and terrible piece of irony.
     "To Disassemble the Machine" strikes another blow in the
     direction of anti-technological ignorance. It practically
     screams its message of "Down with the nukes!" Now FidoNet will
     receive the same bitter fruit of non-technical ignorance,
     hatred, fear, and loathing -- directed at its own Bulletin Board
     Systems. The very system that has been such a medium of
     communication, and therefore such a benefit to Mankind, is laid
     low by ignorant 'experts' who think that they'll make a buck
     scaring the daylights of the average computer user. I don't
     appreciate FidoNews carrying that article, and I don't
     appreciate Time for printing that issue on computer viruses.

     I that that it goes to show that if you tolerate, even foster,
     anti-technological attitudes, and try to act the 'expert' about
     what you are attacking, it'll get back to you eventually. Or, as
     it was better said by someone else: "What goes around, comes
     around." God save us from 'experts'!

     Anybody for a nice, little, radioactive virus?

             SYSOP LIABILITY FOR DISCLOSING PRIVATE MESSAGES

            In  what  appears  to  be the first case of its  kind,  an
     Indiana  law  student and BBS user has sued a  local  sysop,  Bob
     Predaina,  in  federal  court,  claiming  that  he  intentionally
     disclosed  her  private  electronic mail to  others  without  her
     permission.

            The  lawsuit,  which  is  in the early stages  and has not
     reached trial,  relies upon the Electronic Communications Privacy
     Act  of  1986 (the "ECPA"),  which makes  disclosure  of  private
     electronic  mail  without  consent either of the  sender  or  the
     recipient a federal crime.

             The ECPA does not obligate sysops  to  offer private mail
     on their systems. However, if a sysop promises private mail, that
     promise must be kept and the contents of private messages may not
     be disclosed without consent.

               The  ECPA  provides limited exceptions to  the  general
     rule  of no disclosure.  A sysop may voluntarily disclose to  law
     enforcement  authorities the contents of a message pertaining  to
     the commission of a crime,  if read inadvertently by him or if it
     is  read  pursuant  to the exercise of his  duties  as  a  sysop.

               Until  the courts clarify these rules,  sysops who read
     private mail on their systems and disclose it may be playing with
     fire.   Prior  court  cases  involving  telephone  operators have
     established  some useful  guidelines:  an  operator  may disclose
     information  she  overheard   while  checking  the  line  at  the
     user's  request,  but  may  not  disclose  information  overheard
     while  eavesdropping  out  of  curiosity.   Sysops,  like  phone
     operators, will not be considered to have a blanket authorization
     to intercept and disclose private messages.

               Systems  such  as  Fido 11W which  routinely  make  all
     private mail visible to the sysop are therefore problematic.  BBS
     programmers  should consider making private mail truly  private--
     while allowing sysops to turn the private mail option off if they
     do not want it.

               In the meantime, sysops should reconsider whether it is
     worth  having private mail on their systems and should make clear
     to users in no uncertain terms,  through bulletins and  messages,
     the degree of privacy which can be expected, if any.

     Predaina  case  is  available  on  the  LLM  BBS,   Fido  107/801

     If you are a system operator and wish to make money by
     distributing The Structured Programming Language, you
     can call a 2400 baud bbs in NY at 516 935 2027 and
     download file SPL.EXE which will take only 15 minutes.
     It is important to note that the self extracting archive
     file SPL.EXE has 2 files in it that are passsword locked
     and unless given the password will fail crc checks, but
     the files are good. These files are documentation that
     your users will contact me to get the passwords, which
     will insure that I get paid and thus you get paid.
     You will be paid $5 for every paid registration I get from
     users who tell me the filename that uniquely identifies
     your bbs as the distribution point for SPL.
     If you are not a sysop, you can make money after you
     register and pay for your copy of The Structured
     Programming Language. Call 516 694 5872 for details.

                          Fredric L. Rice
                            (103/503.3)

     Now wait  a minute.  There  has been  a  flood of  personal mail
     coming into this  system offering  support  against  a  rebuttal
     which occurred in  FidoNews  pertaining  to  "To Disassemble The
     Machine" which apparently came out this last month.

     It seems that a rebuttal  issued from the  MENSA Hub  was posted
     which  was  apparently  concerned with my  spelling and  use  of
     abbreviations which were misunderstood  by the author.  Though I
     haven't seen the rebuttal yet, the  general consensus in my mail
     describes  such  things  as the  use of  NRA  rather than NRC to
     describe the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission;  perhaps thinking I
     meant the  National  Rifle  Association?  It  seems  the  author
     doesn't   know  that   NRA  is  the  sister  Nuclear  Regulatory
     Association to the AEC, (that's Atomic Energy Commission, MENSA,
     not Automated Equipment Controller).

     As was suggested in some of my mail,  I would ask that  those of
     you who were offended by the rebuttal you read should _NOT_ post
     a  counter  rebuttal   in  FidoNews.  You  have  to  agree  that
     regardless of the media  used  and  the  research  performed  to
     develop an informed  article, there  is  always  someone  who is
     going to take intellectual  offense  and  post  a  response that
     yields nothing but an increase of  the noise-to-signal ratio  in
     FidoNews; increasing distribution costs throughout the network.

     At any rate, thanks for your support  and consideration. It will
     take quite a bit more  than this ignorance to cause  me to flame
     out of the net!
