     ---------------

     In such strident words does Ross Cassell chastise Dallas Hinton for
     perceived evils of the past.  Ironically, as Region 18 Coordinator,
     Ross carries the credentials for a full-fledged membership in the
     "Good Ol' Boys" Club which he decries.  However, he's made a point
     of distancing himself from such association - indeed, he even made a
     reputation for himself as a champion of the "Grunt Sysop" in his
     running of the last Z1C election.

     Dallas, on the other hand, has been widely portrayed by his
     detractors as the epitome of cronyism, both for his longstanding
     role as Region 17 Coordinator and his close association with Bob
     Satti.  While this editor doubts that Dallas is truly evil
     incarnate, the lingering reputation does make him a favored target
     for soap box oratory.

     So what's going on here?  Is there truly a cabal of "Good Ol' Boys"
     which needs busting up, or is Ross merely engaging in demagoguery?
     Did the "Good Ol' Boys" network ever exist, and have they now been
     overthrown by a democratic coalition of "Grunt Sysops?"

     Often, reality is less dramatic than the terms used to characterize
     it, and this may be the case here.  Just what are "Good Ol' Boys"
     that they need be feared so?  A straightforward translation of the
     term would imply that it's a group of individuals who have learned
     to work together and have developed a mutual trust and respect.  If
     the term "boys" can be taken without gender, then the "Good Ol'
     Boys" have been in charge of Fido from the very beginning, and
     continue to this day.  What more apt description than the sysops who
     originally joined with Tom Jennings in the fledgling Fidonet?  How
     else did a group who described themselves as "anarchists" work
     together except by developing trust and respect among themselves?

     But "Good Ol' Boys" is alternately sometimes used as a slur to
     indicate a powered group that is ingrown, using their
     FIDONEWS 17-21               Page 2                   22 May 2000


     close-knittedness to exclude new members and ideas.  Probably it's
     this latter meaning which Ross implies when he chastises Dallas.

     Did, indeed, a controlling group take over Fidonet and exclude all
     others?  The popular legend is that this happened when the
     Coordinator structure adopted Policy 4 as a governing document,
     granting coordinators regulatory powers.  Tom Jennings, widely
     respected as the founder of Fidonet, complained at the time that the
     powers granted were far in excess of the duties taken on by
     coordinators, and maintained that the policy document should merely
     be ignored.  In fact, the legitimacy of Policy 4 has been often
     challenged on the basis that it was never ratified by the sysops who
     comprise the network.

     The case for the Coordinators taking over Fidonet by adoption of
     Policy 4.07 is weak in this editorial opinion.  The structure
     defined in P4 only covers the distribution of netmail, which is only
     part of the net's function.  Important areas, such as echomail and
     file distribution are not substantially addressed.  Indeed, informal
     organizations have grown in the years since P4's adoption to
     administer in these areas, and coordinator control isn't a
     significant part of these organizations.  To my mind, a group of
     coordinators hell-bent on controlling all aspects of the
     organization which is Fido would have merely written these two areas
     into P4 somewhere along the line.

     In fact, Policy 4.07 has never been modified in its ten year
     history, with strong indication that the Coordinators couldn't pull
     together sufficient numbers from their own ranks to adopt any
     changes if they tried.  David Moufarrege ran for the Z1C position
     partly on the basis of a promise to attempt to introduce some needed
     changes to policy... and, to his credit, he certainly tried -
     especially in the early part of his administration.  Yet there's no
     evidence yet that the ideas he's presented have taken hold with the
     Coordinator structure... not even with those in Zone 1.  I doubt
     that the Coordinators as a group will ever address any changes - for
     the simple reason that change can be accomplished through other
     methods, even in defiance of policy.

     If you're confused as to my point, let me just remark that I'm not
     exactly describing an omnipotent cabal of Coordinators with an
     iron-clad and self-serving Policy here :)

     In fact, this editor suspects that the only power coordinators have
     ever held is a bit of technical competence and the willingness to
     make the net go.  The power is derived from others recognition of
     these qualities, and has little to do with policy documents or
     control from some tight-knit group.

     So how about the notion that Fido is now democratically controlled?
     Evidence, again, is to the contrary.  Though elections are the order
     of the day in Fido, an embarrassing detail is that less than 5% of
     all systems seem to participate in the largest elections.  Though
     the intention may be to make Fido a democracy, the bulk of the
     electorate declines to participate.

     FIDONEWS 17-21               Page 3                   22 May 2000


     What does seem to be true now is that any sysop interested can have
     a voice in Fidonet.  Though power groups are often perceived in the
     Coordinator structure, as well as with echomail movers and file
     movers, "outsiders" have often voiced their opinions, gathered
     support, and had their way despite opposition by those perceived to
     be in power.  It seems that Fidonet is now governed by those with
     the interest in governing it... but isn't this just another "Good
     Ol' Boys" club?

     Despite the unusual length of this editorial, I should - in fairness
     - answer the question of whether I believe that Ross Cassell is
     engaged in demagoguery.  Perhaps some may consider Ross as the
     legendary Don Quixote to be tilting with windmills here... but I
     consider him, also like Don Quixote, to be keeping ideals alive.
     Though my reading of the debate in the Z1C echo indicates only that
     Dallas Hinton called for David Moufarrege to "shit or get off the
     pot" and was not a serious attempt to call for his removal - it's
     still nice to know that concerned individuals like Ross will keep
     such debates in the open.  It's what keeps the _actual_ "Good Ol'
     Boys" club good :)

     -->8-- cut here
     So I thought of myself (you still guess, what the hell have
     cablemodems got to do anything with what you are saying?) ... What's
     e-mail. It's nothing but a simple host supporting the POP3/SMTP
     protocol. What we simply need to do is set up one or more
     mailservers, develop a new protocol and a mailclient to support the
     new protocol. A cable-modem can make it possible to set up a
     mailserver with several gigabytes for mail and file-storage without
     paying much.
     -->8-- cut here

     I had a similar idea, but it went something like this:

     1> use existing technology (news servers)
     2> Allow only "known" systems to connect.
            2a> Only "registered" users can read/post.
     3> Abusive systems can be disconnected. This will require definite
        rules.
     4> no "open feeds".
     5> only moderated newsgroups.

     It would not be hard to build a well run news system that could
     augment the echomail system we have now. This system could run in
     parallel to the current news servers on the internet. There's no
     need to create a new protocol. What we might do is use a different
     tcp/ip port, to make ourselves a little different. This could
     differentiate the system enough to let people know that it's not
     just another news system.

     If it's kept moderated, then we wouldn't have the problems plaguing
     the newsgroups like Spam.

     Only allowing registered users makes it harder for news scanners to
     "mine" email addresses and other information.

     A definite set of rules would need to be developed, with
     consequences for those who break the rules, up to and including
     being disconnected from the system. This in and of itself will make
     the whole proposition difficult to build and maintain. The easiest
     way to ensure smooth operation would be to have a few "master" nodes
     that everyone connects to. Every time this type of a system has come
     up in Fido, I've watched as some scream "power monger!" and the
     system either withers and dies, or people who have nothing better to
     do continue to complain until the rest of us throw our hands up in
     disgust.

     Anyway, that's my idea in a nutshell. If anyone wants to discuss
     this (without calling me a power monger! <G>) feel free to write me

                     Ex-sysop's vision of Fido on the Web
                           Email from Brian Kessler
                          BrianKessler@postmark.net

     Hello!

     I'm an ex-SysOp from NJ and I just made a random pitstop at
     http://www.fidonet.org/    ... I wanted to see if Fidonet even still
     existed.... was happy to see that it does, even though in a surely
     diminished form (I noticed there seem to be a few zones missing?).

     Anyway, I agree that the Internet is a lot more impersonal and
     commercial than the Fidonet was (is?).

     With the explosion of free ISPs, I don't see any real niche for any
     BBS that can't get itself a permanent connection to the INet... as
     for Fidonet, I agree it needs a better portal into the Internet.
     Not as web pages though... they are too annoying to navigate... not
     as newsgroups or they'll be exposed to too much spam...

     I think there are two directions to go (other than optimistic
     promotion of telenetable BBSs)... one is a java client that can be
     loaded by java capable browsers that can connect to a "fido-server"
     and manage mail as we might have done offline with Blue Wave.

     The second is an actual Fido-client (or a plug in for existing
     software such as Outlook Express) which would allow for the handling
     of netmail, echomail, mailing file-id's with a links to a fido-ftp
     for the file-echos...  perhaps the client software would use
     assigned point numbers and members would still require human
     approval in order to prevent/limit comercial abuse...

     I don't have all the answers, but I don't think Fidonet has to
     either die, be virtually lost on the web, or be subject to comercial
     abuses...  If everyone and their uncle can put out their own buddy
     list application and still find a user base, I think some developers
     within Fidonet can put out a Fidonet application and if we retain
     the virtues we had before, find a user base.

     Just some ideas for you to pass along...

     -Brian.

                  The FidoNet Technical Standards Committee

     This is the second part of three letters posted by Colin Turner in
     the FTSC_PUBLIC echo, containing information about this important
     Fido organization.  Thanks to Lesley-Dee Dylan for forwarding this
     information to Fidonews.

     ---------------

     Here are some Frequently Asked Questions (and answers) concerning
     the FTSC.

     * How do I join the FTSC?

       The FTSC is an elected body, and you can only be appointed in this
       way.

       Elections are held periodically. You can ask in FTSC_PUBLIC when
       the next election is likely to be. Keep watching FTSC_PUBLIC and
       FidoNews for announcements.


     * How do I suggest my own new standard?

       Any point or node can suggest a new standard. You should read
       FTA-1002 and to a lesser extent FTA-1001, FTA-1006 and FTA-1007.
       After that you should know all you need to, but you can always
       contact the FTSC administrator to clarify any problems.


     * Where do I find the development information I need?

       Experienced developers can find the information they require on
       the FTSC Archive site:

       WWW
         http://www.ftsc.org

       FTP
         ftp://ftp.ftsc.org

       FidoNet 2:443/13.0 and 2:443/14.0

       A list of mirrors is also available.

       Beginners might find it useful to look at the RoadMap project to
       help them find the documents of interest.


     * How can I contact the FTSC?

     In the sale list of links are some things I really like. I'll just

     look like and such? Here you will see some of the current and past
     members of Net124. Yes, I'm in there as well as the R19C. :-)

     Current Dallas Nodes:
     Yup, it's a list of the Nodes in Net124. The list is generated by a
     program written, if I'm not mistaken, by Net124's Paul Lentz.

     Next is a link to "Information about joining FidoNet". This is a
     good overview of what it takes to join Fidonet.

     Under this link are links to:

       Our Friends in NET130's WEB Page
       Our Friends in NET393's WEB Page
       R19 WEB Page
       Collin County Station BBS WEB Page

     This is a nice gesture in that Net130 and 393 are close to Net124
     and share some local echos. The R19 page was reviewed last week and
     I thank Paul for getting the new link up on the Net124 page. Of
     course, My little page is in there as well. :)

     Now, move on down and you'll find the "Fidonet dog with diskette".
     Click on the dog and, if you have a sound card, you should hear
     something. :)

     Ok, that's the site. I like it and there is some good information in
     there. Check it out.

     Regards,

      Frank - flv@texoma.net

     a @ preceding an individual's name implies a virtual email
     address. The email is translated as follows
     firstlast@osirusoft.com will automatically route to the
     appropriate individual's email.  Anyone in this list will
     also receive routed notice of this feature.  In my case, it
     would still be joejared@osirusoft.com, but you get the idea.

     Also, as information is provided to me, I will be adding a
     latency field to each node, which is defined as the maximum
     time between when the message is received, and when it is
     sent on to other nodes, or available to be sent onward,
     defined in minutes. A latency of ! implies that there is an
     immediate response, and an attempt to deliver immediately
