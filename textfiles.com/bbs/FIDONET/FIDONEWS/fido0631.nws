     =================================================================


     Hi there.

     Still reading this thing? Thanks. I appreciate it.

     Is there  anyone  who'd like to be the Editor?  It's burning up a
     lot of my  time.  More than I can afford at this point.  And it's
     getting to be harder  and  harder to psyche myself into doing the
     work anyway.

     If  you're  interested,  send  me    netmail.    Try  to  include
     qualifications,  etc.   I'll forward them  along  to  the  people
     who'll have to decide on my successor.

     I won't leave the position until a replacement is ready.  But I'd
     like  to  start the ball rolling.  (Ooooops,  I  just  remembered
     something.    I  never  told  PubComm.  Rick, Irene  --  I  quit,
     effective as soon as you have a replacement)

     On another note:  I have received a couple of  nice articles that
     were published  in  "real"  publications  already.    I'd love to
     publish them, but I can't unless I have permission from the owner
     of the articles.   Please  don't send me any of that stuff unless
     permission has been granted, or  you can arrange for me to easily
     get it.

     Hey, thanks again.

     Les Kooyman, 1:204/501
     FidoCon Committee Co-Chairperson

             JOHN DVORAK TO BE KEYNOTE SPEAKER AT FIDOCON '89

     The  dates  for  FidoCon '89 are fast  approaching  (August  24th
     through the 27th)! If you haven't yet made your hotel or  confer-
     ence reservations, you should do so as soon as possible to  avoid
     increased  charges.  Although  the official  deadline  for  hotel
     registration has passed, I have it on good authority that follow-
     ing  the  registration procedure for hotel  registrations  (which
     includes  calling  the  hotel directly rather  than  calling  the
     national reservation number) will likely still get you the  hotel
     discount.

     Now, here's the rest of the conference news:

     Friday  night, August 25th, will be the Banquet and  Keynote  Ad-
     dress. This year's Keynote Speaker is Mr. John Dvorak,  columnist
     for PC magazine and well-known observer of the computer industry.
     Tickets to the banquet will be available separately from  Confer-
     ence  Registration to allow people to attend only the Banquet  if
     they wish.

     Registration  night is Thursday, August 24. Friday  and  Saturday
     offer two full days of seminars and workshops, including:
       o   Tim Pozar chairing a panel describing UFGATE, an  interface
     between the FidoNet network and the Usenet network.
       o    Vince  Perriello and Bob Hartman  discussing  BinkleyTerm,
     their freely-available mailer program .
       o     Bob Hartman on FidoNet mail processing by the  BIX  (BYTE
     magazine) online service.
       o     Phil  Becker,  the author of TBBS BBS  software,  on  the
     unique structure and organization of that system.
       o     Tom Jennings, the author of Fido (the  original  network-
     capable  BBS)  on  Fido, routing of mail, and  other  matters  of
     interest.
       o     Chuck Forsberg, noted author of ZMODEM, YMODEM, and other
     file-transfer protocols, on the subject of error-free file trans-
     fer protocols.
       o     Mort Sternheim chairing a panel on the future of  FidoNet
     and the International FidoNet Association (IFNA).
       o     Chris Irwin discussing D'Bridge and Joaquim  Homrighausen
     discussing Front Door, two other fine mailer front-end programs.
       o     Rick Heming talking about Wildcat BBS software,  and  the
     interface from Wildcat to FidoNet.
       o     A representative from US Robotics, a maker of modems,  on
     high speed modem technology.
     FidoNews 6-31                Page 3                   31 Jul 1989


       o     A  panel discussion chaired by Randy Bush  and  Christian
     Stalberg on International FidoNetting (FidoNet spans many nations
     and continents).
       o     A panel discussion concerning Democracy in FidoNet,  sure
     to be a "hot" topic.

     Dates and times of these sessions will be announced shortly in  a
     future edition of FidoNews. Stay tuned.

     Conference  registrations are $60 prior to August  1st  (extended
     from  July 15th), $75 thereafter. Banquet tickets are  $30  each.

     More Tales of Horror from the FidoNet *C's
     by Phil Buonomo 1:107/583, 7:520/583, 9:807/1
        (Whew!  Made it another week!  Guess the RC's don't read
         FidoNews, else I'd have been tossed out long ago!)

     I recently received a file, containing messages I thought the
     sysops of FidoNet should see.  Read on, Macduff!

     --- File Begins

     Mike Lester, As a result of your message to me on April 11, 1989
     stating that you have  put a "file on hold for me" to discourage
     my calling your system,  you have been deemed to be in violation
     of FidoNet Policy3.Doc,  to wit: Excessively Annoying Behavior.
     Distributing, or  threatening to distribute a 'Mail Bomb', is a
     very serious  offense.

     As a result, you are being ex-communicated from FidoNet. Your
     name, your BBS name, and your node numbers are being removed from
     the Nodelist.

     You have the right to appeal my decision. If you decide to do so,
     your first course of appeal would be to our Region Coordinator,
     Justin Marquez, at 1:106/100. If you find no relief there, you
     may contact our Zone  Coordinator, David Dodell, at 1:114/15.

     Bruce Bodger
     Net Coordinator, Net 170

     I never said it was a "MAIL BOMB" you are overreacting. I simply
     said, if you wanted to "FORCE FEED" me an echo I did NOT want,
     that I was going to put my rather LARGE file list on hold for you
     to pick up. fair is fair. Since you decided to change your
     position on the "FORCE FEEDING" of an echo I did not want, I did
     not put any files on hold for you.

     believe me, I am contesting this action...

     Mike

     ==================== end of my responce =======================

     cc:     Bruce Bodger
             Justin Marquez

     Mike, I'm sorry to inform you that I have reviewed materials sent
     to me by your NC, Bruce and the RC, Justin concerning your
     excommunication.  I have  not  seen that they have done anything
     outside of their jurisdiction under  POLICY3  and therefore, have
     no reason to overturn their decision.

     David

     ==================== end of the ZC's responce ==================

     This is the end of the line, no more appeal.... now after
     thinking about it a bit, I decided to make a rebuttle: I know it
     would do no good, but i sent it to a few key people.

      quote from national sysop:
      > RG: Tell me, just how many nodes do you know of that have been
      > RG: excommunicated on the basis of a single offense?  Indeed,
      > RG: how many nodes do you know of that have been excommuni-
      > RG: cated, period?
      end quote

        I was the NC for Tulsa, Ok fidonet 170 for more than 2 years,
        I got out the nodelist/diffs on Fridays, and the fidonews
        EVERY week on time.  (read this with "tongue in cheek") Here
        is the procedure to get a longtime fidonet NC out in 12 steps:

     1) First get the NC(me) to route ALL messages for the local net
     through your node as NEC.

     2) Then, using a message editor that dont leave footprints (FD
     editor), make changes to the messages the NC posts locally, and
     make sure some if not most are a degrading nature in responce to
     simple questions.

     3) Quietly, forward "copys" to the RC, explaining that you (the
     NEC)  think the NC is "over the edge" and politlely ask what he
     can do about it. A voice phone call helps here, if your GOOD at
     manipulating people. A few of your friends making complaints also
     helps, no matter how bogus they may be. also, if a node wont file
     an "official" complaint make one up in his name and send it in. (
     eg. Joe Savard. )

     FidoNews 6-31                Page 6                   31 Jul 1989


     4) The RC removes the NC for "cause" and appoints the NEC the NEW
     NC.

     5) Now your in "CONTROL". Next, start having "secret" monthly
     meetings where not even wifes are allowed in the room where
     fidonet business is conducted. ( You should have heard some of
     the wives outside when this happened.)

     6) When the old NC(me) finds out about what happened and the
     reason why,  he just shrugs it off and says ok, "you leave me
     alone, and I will leave you alone", Now just wait about 2 weeks
     and be silent.

     7) Un-rest rules the net, because of the changes that have
     happened.  "Un-rest" is an understatement, it almost instantly
     polarized the net. Now its time for some "heavy handed rules".
     ie: You MUST attend the local fidonet meetings. (only heresay)
     You MUST get all your echos from the NC/NEC. You can only have 40
     echos MAX. If you post in the local sysop echo, it must be a
     message that pertains to ALL. Messages of a one to one nature are
     NOT allowed. ect... The penaltys are "you WILL be removed from
     the nodelist" A threat of having NET 170 removed by the RC also
     comes in, if the nodes do not "Cooperate".

     8) Now, dump on the old NC (me) an echo NOT wanted/requested
     without  warning or even asking to have the area set up. (100+
     messages)  ( I had to manually delete them from my netmail area.
     ) ( as in k23<cr> k24<cr> ect... I run an OPUS BBS )

     9) Now comes the part that got ME ex-communicated. When I
     complain saying to discontinue sending the echo, simply send a
     message to the sysop (me) stateing "I'M THE NC, and IF YOU WISH
     TO REMAIN IN FIDONET, YOU WILL RECIEVE THIS ECHO.

     10) When the ex-NC(me) says "ok, fine, you SEND to ME an echo
     that I dont wish to have, I will place a file on HOLD for you to
     pick up every time you call. (note: the FILE was my files
     listing, the one you would get if you requested FILES from my
     system. Not a mail bomb, or virused program. also, I intended on
     recieving the echomail to a passthrough area to no one,
     effectivly deleting the messages.)

     11) The new NC then quietly removes the ex-NC(me) from the
     nodelist for  that week because he is "annoyed". no warning, no
     nothing was ever sent to me about this.

     12) When I complain again, pass it along to the RC, who then
     passes it along to David Dodell, who ultimatly, finds that "No
     one has done anything outside of policy."

     It happened to me, and when final, 15 sysops, left fidonet 170
     Now its time for a NEW RULE for the local net. Rule: You can't be
     in fidonet 170 if you allow Mike Lester ex-NC of Fidonet 170 on
     your system as a user. (Just ask the sysop of 7:771/208.0 if this
     is true or not.) The bottom line is this, I was ex-communicated
     from fidonet simply for saying I was going to "put a FILE on
     FidoNews 6-31                Page 7                   31 Jul 1989


     hold". The FILE was NEVER sent, since the new NC removed me from
     the nodelist. He never called back either, after I sent him the
     message I was going to put the file on hold  for him. So, I never
     actually DID anything wrong, but i was  ex-communicated for it
     anyway.  I even ASKED the RC for a REGION number, and it was
     refused, by saying that there was already an existing net in
     Tulsa, and I HAD to be in it or not at all.

     So this guy, Mike Lester, gets excommunicated from FidoNet.  His
     network gets so upset they 'vote out' the NC appointed by RC19,
     who then declares the vote 'illegal' and throws it out.  Most of
     the network then quits FidoNet.

     So we have another case where an RC 'kills' a network for the
     'good' of FidoNet.

     Are you starting to see the danger of living under Policy4 now?

     This story would be bad enough, but now we learn that after these
     guys join AlterNet, the FidoNet NC and RC start trying to take
     over the echomail conferences the 'excommunicated' nodes are
     contributing to!  Funny thing is, I thought that FidoNet echomail
     policy stated that conferences belonged to the MODERATORS!

     Well, as a moderator of a number of conferences, I give a warning
     to any *C that might feel bound to keep ANYONE following MY rules
     in ANY of MY conferences from posting:

     KEEP YOUR DAMN HANDS OFF MY CONFERENCES, OR YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF
     THE SUBJECT OF A POLICY COMPLAINT SO FAST IT'LL MAKE YOUR HEAD
     SWIM!

                           Net 134 and Policy 4

      I was asked to submit the following for the beginning of July
     but was unable to do so at that time.  With my apologies here it
     is now.
       The first section is a resolution we voted on.  The second is a
     sober look at P4 and its implementation which it was suggested I
     submit with the resolution.  For the record, there was not one
     person in net 134 who expressed any reservations about including
     the second part.

      Charles Ford (134/19)

                         Net 134 Resolution Re. P4

     A.  Net 134 likes FidoNet and wishes to remain in it.
     B.  The majority of Net 134 does not accept Policy4 on the basis
         of its implementation.
     C.  Net 134 is willing to work on a committee to formulate a
         democratic policy.


              STATEMENT OF POSITION REGARDING POLICY 4

        "It's done.  It's finished.  Now let's fix it."  is the
     rallying cry I hear from above these days.  I wish I could accept
     things that easily.  "What is the problem?  P4 is a lot better
     than Policy 3, isn't it?" some say.

        The truth of the matter is that Policy 4 simply does not exist
     in Fidonet. This is not a statement of position or opinion, it is
     really the way it is.

        Right off I will say that there are major problems with Policy
     4 both in its content and the way it was declared to be in force.
     This is no longer a choice between P3 and P4.  It goes deeper
     than that.  Fidonet has grown extraordinarily since 1984.  The
     original policy documents were probably fine for a small group
     that largely knew each other.  If memory serves me correctly,
     there were about 1700 nodes when I first started to get involved
     with Fidonet.  At the time I joined, it was after agreeing to
     abide by P3.  P3 had its problems but its terms were those I
     accepted coming into Fidonet.  That is true for the vast majority
     of the rest of Fidonet sysops as well.

        An agreement is an agreement.  You don't complain about it
     after the fact. Now along comes P4.  What's the problem?  It
     unilaterally breaks the agreement between the front-line sysop
     and the Fidonet administration.  None of us agreed to that coming
     in.  The agreement has been broken and those who broke it want to
     force on a new one.  If an agreement has been broken by one party
     the other party is no longer bound by it.  Hence the authority
     fomerly entrusted to the other party no longer holds.  I didn't
     break the agreement.  The vast majority of Fidonet sysops did not
     break the agreement.  The *Cs broke it.  That is statement of
     fact.  THE ISSUE IS NO LONGER P3 vs P4.  IT IS RATHER THAT THERE
     FidoNews 6-31                Page 9                   31 Jul 1989


     IS NO LONGER A BINDING POLICY ON NODE SYSOPS AT ALL.

        "But there was no mechanism for policy change," is the
     argument foisted on us.  True, but then the honorable and proper
     thing to do is to work out a mutually agreeable solution to the
     problem or at least some sort of consensus. This was not done.
     P4 was pushed through with the trench-sysop having no say.

        What was the rush?  Why is it that ammendents to give the
     nodes a say were verboten before P4 was pushed through but now
     are to be given serious consideration for some future policy
     document?  I do not personally know any *C above my own NC -- as
     is the case for most of us.  We are not really in a position to
     judge their character or motivations but we can judge their
     behavior.  When the salesman says, "Trust me.  This is a great
     product,"  and it turns out to be made of junk, I don't buy from
     him again.  The policy that the *Cs have proclaimed is just like
     that.  How can there be trust after such a betrayal?

       "Charles, you're such an extremist," some of you might be
     thinking.  Am I really?  Let's get down to specifics.

      1. The voting procedure.
          - The IC did the collecting counting and announcing of the
            vote results. To date he has not allowed independent
            verification. Fidonet policy affects his life and future
            plans directly.  Now he might be the most upright and
            honest man in the world but IT IS INCREDIBLE THAT WE
            SHOULD BE EXPECTED TO BELIEVE THAT THE VOTE WAS COLLECTED,
            THE BALLOTS COUNTED, AND THE RESULTS ANNOUNCED ALL BY THE
            SAME PERSON, A PERSON WITH A BIG STAKE IN THE OUTCOME, AND
            THIS WAS DONE WITH NO FIDDLING WHATSOEVER WHEN THERE IS NO
            WAY TO CONFIRM OR DISPROVE HIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  If votes are
            to have any credibility at all, the ballots must be
            collected and counted by someone without an immediate
            stake in the process and there must be more than one
            person involved to ensure that the process is honest. Were
            we given true and honest results for the vote on P4, such
            as it was?  Does anyone but the IC know for sure? How?  I
            don't see how any of us can know.

      2. P4 itself - The reason it had to be passed in such a hurry
                     was that it brought a new measure of democracy
                     and accountability to Fidonet.  But does it?
                     Let's have a closer look.

          a) IC selection and accountability.
              - Only the Zone Coordinators (four people right now) can
                select or replace the IC.  The IC can only come from
                their ranks.  Only the IC can extend or interpret
                policy on specific issues.  The ZCs can overrule him
     FidoNews 6-31                Page 10                  31 Jul 1989


                on a specific interpretation or extension, however.
                The IC collects and counts the ballots in any case.

                                     1.2.7
                                     6.1
                                     7.2

                This is largely just formalizes how things are.  The
                IC could not function without the support of the ZCs.
                The position is still basically a life position
                without review and those at the very top still appoint
                him.  In one respect it strengthens the IC position in
                that criticism of the IC now must go through the ZCs.
                Before that it must go through the RCs.  The fact that
                the complete voting process is controlled in all
                aspects by the IC and only the IC means that there can
                be no confidence in the announced results.

          b) ZC and RC selection and accountability.
              - This is a circular, cosy relationship where the 49
                people involved are accountable only to each other
                while controlling the communication activities of over
                6000 others, based on the current node list.

                                     1.2.4
                                     1.2.5
                                     1.2.8
                                     8.7.1


          c) NC selection and accountability
              - Selection and removal is completely at the disgression
                of the RC
              - Accountability is only to the RC
              - NC activities affect the nodes almost exclusively

                                     4.1
                                     5.7

          d) Nodes
              - Entry is basically for the asking.  After that all
                activities are subject to the *Cs dictates.

          e) Policy changes
              - These can only be instituted by a majority of the RCs
                asking for a vote by the NCs on a new policy drafted
                exclusively by the RCs. The voting block represents
                about 5% of those in Fidonet since the NCs do not have
                to vote in accordance with the wishes of their net.
                In light of the fact that an NC can be removed at the
                discretion of his RC there is a strong pressure to
     FidoNews 6-31                Page 11                  31 Jul 1989


                vote in accordance with the policy.  Reduced to simple
                terms, that means that 24 people develop a policy that
                about 5% of the people affected get to vote on and of
                that 5% any number could be subject to coercion.

                The problems with having a representative result
                announced are further compounded because the voting
                process is designed in such a way that the integrity
                of the process cannot be relied on.  Indeed it is so
                deficient that it is obvious it has been given no
                serious consideration at all.  To put it more bluntly,
                the figures and results could be made up out of the
                ICs head and nobody could question them.

                                     8.1
                                     8.3
                                     8.4


     Summary:
             1) The current Fidonet node sysops made an agreement to
                abide by Policy 3 when they joined Fidonet.  This
                agreement has been repudiated by the *C structure with
                NO NODE LEVEL SAY IN THE PROCESS.

                  a) Since the agreement has been broken by the one
                     party, the other is no longer bound by it.

                  b) If one agreement is broken, what guarantee is
                     there that any others will be honored?

             2) P4, if it were valid, REMOVES the right of the nodes
                to a say in a process that primarily affects them.
                This IS a loss of rights based on the agreement
                outlined above.

             3) P4 actually consolidates power over what may soon be
                the world's largest personal computer communication
                network into the hands of a very few under a pretense
                of some democratic process and accountability. The
                reality is that there is nothing to ensure the
                integrity of either the voting process or the
                accountability.  This consolidation has no basis under
                it other than that 49 people have said that this is
                how the thousands in Fidonet shall function.

     Final Comments

        P4 has no moral and, most likely, no legal force.  Acceptance
        by the nodes means that they are giving up the rights they
        once had to some effective say in the process.

        Policy 4 is not only zero improvement, it involves grave
        losses in rights to the owners of Fidonet -- the sysops.
        Policy 4 takes ownership of the network from you.  And you
        just might let it happen.
