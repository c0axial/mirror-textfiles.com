                    The Colorado Springs PC Users Group
                                    and
                   The International Fido Net Association

                              to be held from
                           August 14 to 17, 1986
                       in Colorado Springs, Colorado



     The Silicon Mountain Fido Conference will take place from  August
     14 through August 17, 1986, in Colorado Springs, Colorado, at the
     Colorado  Springs  Hilton  Inn.  Register as soon as possible for
     the conference, by mailing in the registration form and by making
     room reservations at the Hilton Inn.  Registration may be made on
     line at any of the Fido Conference Coordinator BBS numbers:

         303-578-0860   (1/10 outgoing)
         303-596-6232   (1/10 Incoming)

     Information will also be available at the COSUG BBS:

         303-635-5468   (128/13)

     The registration form will be circulated in a couple of days.

     To register through FidoMail,  please send a  message  to  us  at
     1/10,  and  follow  up by sending a hard copy of the registration
     form by mail or send a file with  the  extension  ".REG".  Please
     put a variation of your name on the file and tell us the name you
     have  given  your  registration  form in your message.  If we get
     multiple files with the same name, it could a problem for us.

     Please follow up by making a guaranteed reservation at the Hilton
     Inn.  To  guarantee  your  room  for  late  arrival,  the  Hilton
     requires  a  credit  card  number  (Master Card,  Visa,  American
     Express, Carte Blanche, Diners Club and Discover are accepted) or
     a  deposit.  Without  a  guarantee,  they  will  not hold it past
     6:00 PM of the arrival date.  When you call in your  reservation,
     be  sure  to  tell  the  person  taking  it that you are with the
     "Silicon Mountain Fido Conference" or the  "Fido  Conference"  or
     "International  Fido  Sysops" to be sure that your reservation is
     at the group rate.

     The room rates are as follows:

         Single or Double (one bed or two)       $60.00 per night
         Triple occupancy                        $75.00 per night
         Quad occupancy                          $90.00 per night
         Parlor                                 $120.00 per night

     Because the Hilton does not  care  how  you  share  your  accomo-
     dations,  some  of  you  may wish to double up and split the room
     charges.  You may be able to find someone in your local  net  who
     also  wishes  to  share.  Or  send  a  message around FidoNet for
     someone to share with.

     The address and telephone number of the Hilton Inn is:

         505 Popes Bluff Trail
         Colorado Springs, CO.
         303-598-7656

     The Hilton Inn is located at Exit 146 (Garden of the  Gods  Road)
     off of I-25 in northern Colorado Springs.

     Other  motels in the immediate vicinity (within walking distance)
     include  "Howard  Johnson's",  "Ramada  Inn",  and  "Econolodge."
     Within  a  short  driving distance,  there are many other motels,
     which may be  cheaper  than  these.  Because  we  are  getting  a
     special  rate,  you  cannot  expect  to save much by staying at a
     place other than the Hilton,  unless you  have  your  own  trans-
     portation.

     To  be  sure  that a room is reserved for you,  we need a message
     from you that you are coming as soon as possible.  A large  block
     of  rooms  has  been  reserved  for  us,  but unless we have your
     reservation by August 1 at the latest, we can not guarantee you a
     room at the conference rate.  Because it is  the  height  of  the
     tourist season,  you will have to compete with the tourists for a
     motel room.  I have to give the Hilton an estimate of the  number
     of  rooms  we need by July 1,  and a room list is due August 1 at
     the latest.  Although you can probably still find  lodging  after
     August 1, it may not be at the Hilton.

     The  deadline  for  reservations for the banquets and other group
     meals is 48 hours in advance.  All parties and receptions will be
     cash bar.

     We have set a conference fee of $60.00 for the  full  conference.
     If you wish to attend Saturday only,  the conference fee would be
     $30.00.  The rate for full time students is  $35.00  and  $20.00,
     respectively.  Registration  after August 1 will be an additional
     $10.00.  In addition you will  want  to  attend  the  banquet  on
     Friday night,  which will be an additional $15.00 per plate,  and
     the luncheon on Saturday,  which will be  $7.50  per  plate.  The
     cost  of  the  Saturday  dinner  at  the  Flying  W Ranch will be
     announced later.  It will include transportation by  bus  to  and
     from the Hilton Inn.

     We  are  working  on  a  special  trip up Pikes Peak by cog wheel
     railway at a cost to be announced later.  The stated meal  prices
     include  taxes and service charges.  The amount of the conference
     fee is  based  on  what  is  needed  to  recover  the  conference
     expenses.  In  addition  we  hope  you  will  see  fit  to send a
     voluntary donation to IFNA,  which is cosponsoring the conference
     and which will be the primary beneficiary of the conference.

     accept  MasterCard  and  Visa over the phone.  Please do not send
     credit card numbers through FidoMail.

     We are trying to work out having computers with modems and  phone
     lines  available for you to call your board and check to see what
     E.T.  did to you when he used your board to phone home while  you
     were  in  Colorado  Springs.  Suggestions  on  how  to handle the
     billing for telephone calls are needed.

     Please  check  for  the  best  deals  on  air  fare.  We  have  a
     conference discount arranged through Continental Air Lines, which
     feeds  through  Denver.  Jack  Armit  of Globe Travel in Colorado
     Springs (303-473-4151) can help  you  with  travel  arrangements.
     Call  him  if  you  are  flying on Continental.  Call him anyway.
     Other  carriers  feed  direct  into  Colorado   Springs   without
     requiring  a  plane  change in Denver as does Continental in many
     cases.  Fares to Denver are about the same as to Colorado.  Check
     it out and let me know what kind of deals you are getting,  so  I
     can   pass   the  information  on.   The  sooner  you  make  your
     reservation, the better the deal you will get.

     We are looking for  persons  to  help  with  the  discussions  of
     DoubleDOS,  EchoMail,  and various other topics.  Suggestions are
     welcome.  We thank those persons  who  have  already  volunteered
     their  time.  Ken Kaplan will have the final say on panel members
     and speakers.  Send us a message at 1/10 with a copy to Ken 1/0.

     See you in Colorado Springs in August!

                            War in the Falklands


          While  scanning  the  files  on  a  long  distance  board  I
     sometimes call,  I spotted a program called FALKLANDS.BAS.  After
     downloading,  I found it was a sophisticated war  game  involving
     ship  and  troop  deployment  as  well as air cover and even ship
     based artillery.  The only problem was  that  there  weren't  any
     instructions!

          The  commands are pretty obvious (they are for the most part
     always visible on the  screen  and  make  extensive  use  of  the
     function keys) however when entering ship and troop movements you
     must  enter the sector number to move into.  Without some sort of
     sector map it's impossible to ascertain your position relative to
     the Falklands or anything else.  Has anybody got a DOC  file  for
     this program?

          Another issue;  is this program user supported?  The startup
     screen identifies it as "War in the Falklands (C) 1983 by  Robert
     Alter  version 1.5".  The copyright notice doesn't by itself mean
     much.  Most programmers I  know  put  such  a  message  on  EVERY
     program.   However  the  absence  of  a  Freeware/User  supported
     message makes me wonder about this program.  I've seen  it  on  a
     number  of  bulletin boards around the country (but then so are a
     LOT of pirated programs).

          I'd like to know something about  this  particular  game.  I
     either  need  the instructions or that it's pirated and I need to
     get rid of it.  Please answer via FidoMail to node 123/7.

                            Mail Order Problems


     I would like to advise all FidoNews readers of a complaint that I
     have  registered  with  the  Illinois  Department   of   Consumer
     Protection,  Office  of  the  Attorney  General,  against  the PC
     Network, of 320 West Ohio St., Chicago, Il. 60610.

     On April 22, 1986,  I ordered a copy of R:Base 5000,  in order to
     take  advantage  of Microrim's 2 for 1 sale if registered by June
     30, 1986. My package did not arrive until May 14, and then it was
     used,  with handwritten notes in the box,  and the diskette  seal
     broken.

     I   immediately   returned   the  merchandise  for  a  "priority"
     replacement, which did not arrive until June 23.

     They have refused several requests to reimburse me telephone  and
     return postage costs of $14.39 for the first package.

     With Microrim's deadline for registration at hand I cannot return
     my  used  copy  of  R:Base,  and  thus  am  forced to retain used
     merchandise,  as well as  the  additional  telephone  and  return
     postage costs.

     I most certainly will not do business with them in the future.

     Tim Rand, 100/255

                          MultiTech MultiModem 223
                                   Review


     I have been running my Fido (AmCross Central - 100/255) off of  a
     MultiTech MultiModem 224 for about the last month.  This modem is
     a  300/1200/2400  baud  device  that emulates the Hayes 1200 baud
     modem with 2400 baud extensions.

     Here are the pertinent setup items for Fido use:

     1. If you run out of a PBX or use  a  long-distance  service  and
        need  to dial with pause codes,  open the cover and set switch
        2-3 to UP.  This sets Wait-for-dial-tone dialing.  This may be
        important to those of you who dial out through MCI,  Sprint or
        other non-1-plus type services.  Replace the cover.

     2. Set  the  switches on switch 1 as viewed through the bottom of
        the modem (really nice feature - no cover to remove  for  most
        users) to:

              1-1 UP   DTR Normal
              1-2 UP   Verbose (word) responses **
              1-3 DOWN Enable command responses
              1-4 UP   Enable command character echo **
              1-5 DOWN Disable auto answer **
              1-6 UP   Carrier Detect and Data Set Ready normal
              1-7 UP   RJ11 (if running in an office set DOWN)
              1-8 DOWN Enable command mode

              ** Fido  overides  these  items anyway.  I set them this
                 way so my modem doesn't get answered when Fido is not
                 up! and so things work better for most comm programs.

     3. Fido takes care of the  rest  except  for  one  thing.  Create
        yourself a FIDOMDM.BBS file with this one command in it:

              AT&Q1

        This  command  tells  the  MultiModem to select the Hayes 2400
        response codes.  This is important because Fido  doesn't  know
        how  to  handle  the  6  or  "DIAL TONE" response that the 224
        usually gives.

     4. Your RUNBBS.BAT command to run Fido  should  not  specify  any
        modem type (ie default to 1/J).  I guess others might work (eg
        a 5/J or 11/J) but why screw with it.


     The MultiModem supports a command  mode  setting  to  change  the
     option  set  in switch #2-3 above.  That is the ATB command.  One
     item that is NOT documented in the manual is that the newer Hayes
     command ATX4 which  sets  both  Wait-for-dial-tone  and  extended
     results  IS supported and does work.  The modem also supports the
     Fidonews                     Page 9                   14 Jul 1986


     "W" in the ATD dial command so you can  do  an  ATDT  9W999-9999.
     This also is not documented.

     At  $389  this  modem is an excellent value.  The modem lists for
     more,  but most dealers are selling it for  about  $400.  If  you
     have  trouble  getting  it for less than $400,  send me a FidoNet
     message and I'll be glad to provide the name of the dealer that I
     use.  It has front panel switches to use a desk phone to dial out
     or manual answer at either 300/1200/2400,  the speaker has a  pot
     (screwdriver  adjust-BOOOH)  to  set  the volume,  and it has the
     right amount of lights on the front.  The  modem  has  been  rock
     steady  and  does  what  it  should.  I have run with a number of
     different comm programs in addition to Fido and had no problem at
     all.

     The modem has a number  of  neat  features  that  are  NOT  Hayes
     compatible.  The  first  of these is the ability to store 9 phone
     numbers and redial them with a short-hand dial  command  ATD  Nx,
     which  would dial number x in the list.  ATL lists them.  This IS
     in conflict with the newer Hayes 1200s which use ATL for loudness
     of the speaker.  ATL5 is a neat command.  It  lists  the  current
     settings  of the E,  Q,  V,  and some of the & commands.  This is
     nice to see what a program does when it  sets  modem  parameters.
     The  last  real  feature  of this modem is the A:  command.  This
     command is a "Demon Dialer" type command that will re-dial  until
     a connect.

     The  modem is built as is typical for other modems in this class,
     that is with an external transformer pack-type three prong  plug,
     and  a  fairly  lightweight plastic case.  This model has a large
     heat-sink on the bottom that gets moderately warm, but in general
     the box runs very cool.  One item of note is that option switches
     peek through the  bottom  of  the  case.  This  is  a  very  nice
     convenience  item,  because  it  makes  it  very easy to check or
     change the switches.  I do wish it had the AA (autoanswer)  light
     on the front that my Hayes 1200 has, but that is really not a big
     deal.

     As  to  support,  I  did  call  MultiTech  about  the above noted
     documentation omissions, and they responded that they were sorry.
     These features had been added after the doc was printed.  I  also
     had  a  problem  with  infant mortality on one of the two units I
     bought.  A new one was back  to  me  within  the  week  including
     shipping  time.  We  also  have  a MultiTech 1200 modem which has
     provided us with excellent  service  and  is  really  very  Hayes
     compatible.  Very  nice  service.  The  folks  on  the phone were
     knowledgeable  and  courteous.  I  would recommend a MultiTech to
     anyone.

                              ROVERMSG Update

     For those of you that have been waiting a long time for the  next
     release  of  ROVERMSG,  your  wait is over!  I have just released
     revision 2.17 of ROVERMSG.  This new version  has  the  following
     nasty little bugs fixed:

     1. Using  Rovermsg  on  a  Rainbow  with the '-c 2' switch really
        works now.

     2. A person with SYSOP privilege does not have to have credit  to
        send FidoNet mail.

     3. A change made in SEAdog caused Rovermsg to not print the first
        character  following  a  soft  carriage  return.  This  is now
        fixed.

     This version also does  not  create  its  own  ROVERLST.SYS  file
     unless  there  is  not a NODELIST.SYS file of revision 5 (which I
     believe is only in Fido 11w,  but it might be in 11v also).  This
     change will save approximately 100K in disk space.

     Finally,  the  most important announcement of all -SOURCE CODE is
     available!  If you register your copy of Rovermsg  for  $15,  you
     are entitled to free FidoNet support (answering questions, etc.).
     For  $25  additional  (total of $40),  I will send you all of the
     source code for Rovermsg.  The code is written for the MANX Aztec
     C compiler,  but if you have another compiler the changes  should
     not be too bad to make.

     As always,  the latest version of Rovermsg can be downloaded from
     Fido 132/101.  I am now running SEAdog, so if you want to request
     it via SEAdog mail, let me know and I will set you up to have the
     file held for you to poll.

     =================================================================
                                  COLUMNS
     =================================================================

                  Taking Advantage of Your PC's Hard Disk:
                 Part III, CONFIG.SYS and the Virtual Disk
                                Barry Gordon
                      New York Personal Computer, Inc.

     There  are  some  simple  things  you  can  do  to  enhance   the
     performance of your hard drive.  Creating a CONFIG.SYS file and a
     virtual  disk  can  give  you added power and speed in working on
     your PC by reconfiguring your operating system and Random  Access
     Memory (RAM).

     The CONFIG.SYS File

     Another  file  that  is  useful  in  the  root  directory  is the
     CONFIG.SYS file.  It's a collection of miscellany to  modify  the
     way  the  PC system works.  You may want to try a CONFIG.SYS file
     consisting of three lines:

              BREAK=ON
              FILES=16
              BUFFERS=8

     The BREAK command allows you to interrupt the system more  easily
     should you wish to terminate the execution of a program.

     The  FILES  command allows DOS to juggle more than the default of
     eight active files simultaneously.  This  is  important,  because
     DOS  loads  five  files of its own,  leaving you with only three.
     Sixteen should give you enough to handle most any situation.

     The  BUFFERS  command  can  speed  up  certain  kinds   of   disk
     operations.  You  may  want to try as many as 16 or even 32 for a
     20MB hard disk.

     The Virtual Disk

     A large internal RAM not only allows manipulation of larger files
     when necessary,  but gives  the  user  access  to  the  speed  of
     internal  memory  for  processing  data.  Just  as  the hard disk
     increases computing speed over the diskette  drive,  so  internal
     memory,  if  utilized,  increases  computing  speed over the hard
     drive.  To tap the speed and power of the  internal  memory,  you
     might consider setting up a virtual disk.  However, to attempt to
     set up a virtual disk,  you should have more than 256KB of memory
     in your PC, preferably, 512KB or larger.

     The virtual disk is a portion of RAM  set  aside  to  simulate  a
     disk.  The  virtual  disk is referred to by the drive designation
     letter following that of the system's last hard disk.  Assuming a
     single hard disk C:,  our virtual disk becomes  D:.  The  virtual
     disk is created at startup by a program such as the VDISK command
     that  comes  with  DOS 3.0.,  working together with a command you
     Fidonews                     Page 12                  14 Jul 1986


     save in your CONFIG.SYS file.

     With 512KB of RAM, a reasonable virtual disk size to try is 64KB.
     If you have a 640KB system, you may want to set up a virtual disk
     of 192KB.  I suggest leaving about 448KB of available, active RAM
     to have ample memory for DOS to do its work.

     A virtual disk of even 64KB  can  do  wonders.  It  can  also  be
     effectively  larger  by  specifying  the smallest possible sector
     size -- e.g., 128 bytes -- for the greatest possible data packing
     density.  Assuming VDISK.COM and 640KB of RAM,  the virtual  disk
     specification in your CONFIG.SYS might look like this:

              DEVICE=C:\VDISK

     The entire CONFIG.SYS file would look like this:

              BREAK=ON
              FILES=16
              BUFFERS=8
              DEVICE=C:\VDISK.SYS 192 128 64

     The SETPATH.BAT and AUTOEXEC.BAT Files Revised

     What  do you do with this virtual disk D:  now that it is set up?
     First,  you can begin to take  full  advantage  of  your  virtual
     disk's  speed  by  adding a statement to AUTOEXEC.BAT to transfer
     the sub-directory of your most-used files to the virtual disk D:.

     Your AUTOEXEC.BAT file now contains the following:

              DATE
              TIME
              PROMPT $P$G
              COPY \anyname1\*.* D:
              D:SETPATH

     Note that the SETPATH command must remain the  last  one  in  the
     file.  Next,  modify  the  PATH  command (in SETPATH.BAT) to PATH
     D:\;C:\anyname2;C:\any3;C:\any4  replacing  the  c:\anyname1  you
     formerly  had  in  SETPATH.BAT  with  the  root directory of your
     virtual drive D:\.  (Again, note that you specify complete paths,
     including  all  drive  designations,  to keep the command totally
     independent of what the default drive might happen to be.)

     Finally,  move the SETPATH.BAT file out of the root directory and
     into  the \anyname1 directory for automatic transfer to D:.  This
     allows you to execute the SETPATH  command  from  any  directory,
     entering it as simply SETPATH or D:SETPATH if necessary.

     The  root directory on your hard drive now contains the following
     files:

              <IBMBIO.COM>
              <IBMDOS.COM>
              COMMAND.COM
     Fidonews                     Page 13                  14 Jul 1986


              AUTOEXEC.BAT
              Sub-directory Names
              CONFIG.SYS
              VDISK.COM (or equivalent)

     Tips Concerning The Virtual Drive

     Now that your PC has the virtual disk D:,  you will want to  keep
     only your most-used files in your C:\anyname1 directory.  I would
     suggest you put in some DOS external command files, plus regulars
     like BASIC.COM, or perhaps a few of your personal favorites, such
     as PE.EXE or your word processing program.  Depending on the size
     of  your  virtual  disk,  you  might  even  wish to add some non-
     executable, but nonetheless frequently used, files that you would
     like to have accessible from any sub-directory.

     All  of  these  would  presumably  reside  permanently  in   your
     C:\anyname1  directory  so that they transfer automatically to D:
     at system startup.  The one thing you must  not  forget  is  that
     your  virtual  disk D:  actually resides in RAM and not on a real
     disk drive.  I suggest you do not store anything in your  virtual
     drive  that  is  not  stored  in a file on your hard disk or on a
     diskette,  because whenever you turn your PC off or whenever  the
     power fails, everything in your virtual disk is cleared.

     Summary

     A brief summary of what the various files might look like is
     given below:

     The Root Directory

              <IBMBIO.COM>
              <IBMDOS.COM>
              COMMAND.COM
              AUTOEXEC.BAT
              Sub-directory Names
              CONFIG.SYS
              VDISK.COM    (or equivalent)

     CONFIG.SYS File

              BREAK=ON
              FILES=16
              BUFFERS=8
              DEVICE=C:\VDISK.SYS 192 128 64

     The numercial values in the DEVICE command will vary depending on
     the size you wish your virtual disk to be.

     AUTOEXEC.BAT File

              DATE
              TIME
              COPY  C:\anyname 1\*.* D:
              PROMPT $P$G
     Fidonews                     Page 14                  14 Jul 1986


              D:SETPATH

     The  D:  shown  above  presumes that you don't have a second hard
     disk attached to your PC.  With two hard disks,  the virtual disk
     would be E:.

     SETPATH.BAT File

              PATH D:\;C:\any1;C:\any2\;C:any3;...

     That's  it.  My  experience  shows  that  a  hard disk with large
     internal RAM,  set up more or less as recommended here,  can be a
     real pleasure to operate.

                   THE FIRST STEP -- CHOOSING AN INDUSTRY


          As  your  no  doubt  aware  --  particularly  if  you're  an
     individual who has already been employed several years or more --
     the U.S. job market is really many job markets, in fact thousands
     of  them.  But  for  purposes  of job hunting,  it makes sense to
     think of "job  market"  and  "industry"  as  roughly  synonymous.
     Given  this  definition,  your initial problem is to decide which
     industry (i.e.,  job market) best suits your  qualifications  and
     needs.   Obviously,   having   a   degree   in,   say,   business
     administration or a computer specialization,  qualifies  you  for
     positions  in  many industries -- and yet,  your work experience,
     career path, and life style will depend greatly on which industry
     you  accept  employment  with,  and  hence  become  part  of.  An
     accounting position in the telephone industry,  for example, will
     probably lead you in a much different direction than one  in  the
     insurance industry,  consulting, or federal government.  Thus you
     should consider that, in accepting a job,  you're also accepting,
     and  becoming  part  of  an  industry.  The chances are good that
     you'll remain with that industry in come capacity throughout your
     working life.

          Even so,  are you really familiar with the  many  industries
     which  compromise  the  U.S.  economy?  Are you familiar with the
     many occupations within those industries which your education  or
     experience  may  qualify  you for?  If not -- as is the case with
     most people -- then your  job  hunting  effort  must  start  with
     INDUSTRY   RESEARCH.   You   need  to  gain  a  reasonably  clear
     perspective on contemporary events and conditions in each of  the
     industries  which  may  hold opportunities for you.  Without this
     basic understanding,  you simply have no idea where to focus your
     job hunting effort.

          The  following  reference materials (among others) will help
     you locate current articles and books on any industry you care to
     research:

     Northwest Super Fido (#105/2)
     Formerly 146/0,1

          For quite a while now many people have  been  talking  about
     merging  networks 105 (Portland area) and 146 (LNA Net) into one.
     So at the local area system operators meeting held last  week  we
     went ahead and combined.  Not a large task indeed,  in fact,  the
     whole process took about 3 minutes from the time of the  decision

     to the assignment of new node numbers.  But here is what's new:

        New Number      Board Name                  Old Number
       ------------    -------------------------   ------------
          105/2         Northwest Super Fido          146/0,1
          105/3         Dim Sum                        146/5
          105/9         S.I.M. NoChange  (MO:)         146/6
           --           Engineers 1      (Down)        146/2
         105/098        Private                       146/098
         105/099        Private                       146/099

          The  Engineers  1  was  taken down for reconstruction.  This
     shouldn't be too confusing at all.  The changes listed here  will
     be effective immediatly.
