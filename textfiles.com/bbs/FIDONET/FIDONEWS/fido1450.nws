                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================

     This Issue has pro and con Christmas poems and one Hanukkah joke. So
     far that's all that's come in for the effort. There isn't anything
     about Solstice, Ramadan or Kwanzaa, yet. If your favorite hasn't
     appeared, yet, you still have one more week to submit it.

     The ZEC election nominations are underway. A couple of well-meaning
     but obviously confused folks nominated and seconded yours truly for
     the post. Since I don't believe in Echomail [I'm an Etheist {snicker}]
     and don't have the technical wherewithal for such a job, I certainly
     decline the 'honor' for all time.

     Candidates who don't decline [even if they should], can publish their
     platforms and promises right here, if they wish.

     I only hope the ZEC election motivates some action in other venues
     like the quest for an International Coordinator. When that comes
     along, I most certainly will accept the nomination. [evil grin]

     Speaking of the Nodelist, I see we are slipping on our worldwide
     synchronization again. Some international network we are. [sigh]

     Anybody want their Christmas [or other festival] wish published next
     week? Send in your properly formatted text file with the extension of
     your choice [freq ARTSPEC.DOC] before Saturday. Details on submission
     are in the Masthead at the end of every Issue. ARTSPEC.DOC appears in
     the Notices section today in case your system cannot do a
     file-request or you are not a Sysop. You don't have to be a Sysop to
     publish in FidoNews.

      A Bah Humbug Christmas

        T'was the night before Christmas - Old Santa was pissed
        He cussed out the elves and threw down his list,

        Miserable little brats, ungrateful little jerks
        I have good mind to scrap the whole works

        I've busted my ass for damn near a year
        Instead of "Thanks Santa" - what do I hear

        The old lady bitches cause I work late at night
        The elves want more money - The reindeer all fight

        Rudolph got drunk and goosed all the maids
        Donner is pregnant and Vixen has AIDS

        And just when I thought that things would get better
        Those assholes from IRS sent me a letter

        They say I owe taxes - if that ain't damn funny
        Who the hell ever sent Santa Clause any money

        And the kids these days - they all are the pits
        They want the impossible ...Those mean little shits

        I spent a whole year making wagons and sleds
        Assembling dolls...Their arms, legs and heads

        I made a ton of yo yo's - No request for them
        They want computers and robots...they think I'm IBM!

        If you think that's bad...just picture this
        Try holding those brats...with their pants full of piss

        They pull on my nose - they grab at my beard
        And if I don't smile..the parents think I'm weird

        Flying through the air...dodging the trees
        Falling down chimneys and skinning my knees

        I'm quitting this job...there's just no enjoyment
        I'll sit on my fat ass and draw unemployment

     Subject: Sobering Santa Stuff

     1)  No known species of reindeer can fly.

          BUT there are 300,000 species of living organisms yet to be
          classified, and while most of these are insects and germs,
          this does not COMPLETELY rule out flying reindeer which only
          Santa has ever seen.

     2)  There are 2 billion children (persons under 18) in the
         world.

          BUT since Santa doesn't (appear) to handle the Muslim,
          Hindu, Jewish & Buddhist children, that reduces the workload
          to 15% of the total - 378 million according to Population
          Reference Bureau.  At an average (census) rate of 3.5
          children per household, that's 91.8 million homes.  One
          presumes there's at least one good child in each.

     3)  Santa has 31 hours of Christmas to work with.

          This is due to the different time zones and the rotation of
          the earth, assuming he travels east to west (which seems
          logical). This works out to 822.6 visits/second.

          This is to say that for each Christian household with good
          children, Santa has .001 second to park, hop out of the
          sleigh, jump down the chimney, fill the stockings,
          distribute the remaining presents under the tree, eat
          whatever snacks have been left, get back up the chimney, get
          back into the sleigh and move on to the next house.

          Assuming that each of these 91.8 million stops are evenly
          distributed around the earth (which, of course, we know to
          be false but for the purposes of our calculations we will
          accept), we are now talking about .78 miles/household, a
          total trip of 75.5 million miles; not counting stops to do
          what most of us must do at least once every 31 hours, plus
          feeding & etc.

          So Santa's sleigh must be moving at 650 miles/second, 3,000
          times the speed of sound.  For purposes of comparison, the
          fastest man-made vehicle on earth, the Ulysses space probe,
          moves at a poky 27.4 miles/second.  A conventional reindeer
          can run, tops, 15 miles/hour.

     FIDONEWS 14-50               Page 4                   15 Dec 1997


     4)  The payload on the sleigh adds another interesting
          element. Assuming that each child gets nothing more than a
          medium-sized lego set (2 lb.), the sleigh is carrying 321,300
          tons, not counting Santa, who is invariably described as
          overweight.  On land, conventional reindeer can pull no more
          than 300 lb.  Even granting that "flying reindeer" (see #1)
          could pull 10 TIMES the normal amount, we cannot do the job
          with 8, or even 9 reindeer.  We need 214,200. This increases
          the payload - not counting the weight of the sleigh - to 353,430
          tons.

          This is four times the weight of the ocean-liner Queen
          Elizabeth.

     5)  353,000 tons traveling at 650 miles/second creates
          enormous air resistance.

          This will heat the reindeer up in the same fashion as a
          spacecraft reentering the earth's atmosphere.  The lead pair
          of reindeer will absorb 14.3 QUINTILLION joules of energy.
          Per second.  Each.  In short, they will burst into flame
          almost instantaneously, exposing the reindeer behind them,
          and create deafening sonic booms in their wake. The entire
          reindeer team will be vaporized within 0.00426 of a second.
          Meanwhile, Santa, will be subjected to centrifugal forces
          17,500.06 times greater than gravity.  A 250-lb. Santa
          (seems ludicrously slim) would be pinned to the back of his
          sleigh by 4,315,015 lb. of force.

          If Santa ever DID deliver presents on Christmas Eve, he's
          dead now.

     Ho Ho Ho, Merry Christmas!!!

     Open letter from 1:395/8
     Larry Black, 1:395/8

     Dear Bruce, Jim, and Chris,

     I wish to thank all of you for supporting me in my time of need.  At
     this time, I am still unable to comply with Crashmail, Zone Mail Hour,
     Etc., Etc., due to reasons beyond my Control.  However, as an old-time
     member, and one of the local Founders of 395, I was very active in
     helping Fido acquire new nodes, and always supported the Efforts of
     new sysops, which was extremely Difficult in the Killeen/Fort Hood
     area, due to the large turnover of military personnel in our Unique
     situation.

     Every day, I watch as we Lose more and more sysops and more and more
     nodes around the world to that Hi-Tech THANG called the Internet!!  To
     me, it is TOTALLY incomprehensible that a few remaining Hobbyist
     Sysops that helped build THE WORLD'S GREATEST AMATEUR MAIL NETWORK
     must be STUCK in a rut with a Policy that was enacted in the 8-bit
     days of computers.  Meanwhile, the World is moving Forward on the
     Internet, which does NOT have such Draconian restrictions!  For the
     last two years, we have watched many of the Amateur mail networks that
     I and the others have participated in rapidly Disappear (RBBS-Net,
     Egg-Net, Etc., Etc.,), mostly due to the fact that they attempted to
     clone the archaic policies of the larger Fidonet and Refused to adapt
     to the changing technology around them.

     I find it strange that Zone 2 has somehow managed to elude parts of
     the archaic Policy 4, mostly due to the infighting over the one simple
     rule that Fido has.  Zone 2 meanwhile has an Internet Site that allows
     sysops with a Node Number to directly pick up mail over the Internet
     and has made changes to allow its users to directly participate in
     online conferences through the Internet.  Perhaps if we were less
     restrictive and worried less about who has node numbers and Zone Mail
     Hours, and were more concerned about maintaining sysops in the
     nodelist instead of watching a shrinking nodelist, we could provide a
     more REALISTIC and REAL TIME Echolist by having numerous Internet
     Sites that provide access to Users and Sysops for realtime response
     throughout the world.

     The Truth is that I, as well as most of the older Fido sysops around
     the world, became a part of the Net not for Chit-Chat with other
     sysops, but so we could get Responses from PC Hardware Manufacturers,
     specifically Modem Manufacturers, and other communications tools about
     PC Hardware, so that when I need a new init string, I didn't have to
     sit on the phone for 14 hours at my expense to get a new AT&F string.
     And of course, we were able to interact with shareware/software
     authors around the world, which is a Good thing, in what was a super-
     timely manner of only 3-5 days.  In the days of 2400 baud modems, that
     was a Wonderful thing!  In today's modern world, using this wonderful
     thing called the WORLD WIDE WEB, every large and small PC hardware,
     FIDONEWS 14-50               Page 6                   15 Dec 1997


     modem, shareware, software, etc., company has an online WEB-SITE
     providing people around the world with INSTANTANEOUS access to
     drivers, fixes, and help!!  Don't you think it's strange that us
     hobbyist sysops, using our sizzling fast Pentium computers and light-
     speed 56K modems still have to wait the same original 3-5 days (BTW, I
     have a Skylink satellite dish in my back yard for downloading Fidonet
     mail that used to cost me an annual subscription that I would gladly
     donate to a dedicated hobbyist if he paid the shipping cost.  However,
     It's still cheaper (aka FREE) to get Fido echoes from zone TWO over
     the Internet!).

     I realize that all of you will see that this is irrelevant, so if you
     wish, because I am not in compliance, you may pull my node number.
     However, I would like to HUMBLY request an independent node number.
     If this is impossible, you may use the Internet gateway, (providing
     that it's still working) to send me mail at Larry.Black@ToadNet.com.

     Thank You.

     Larry Black
     1:395/8_???
     86:8406/5

     P.S.  Instead of people at the top, Region Coordinator, Zone
     Coordinator, etc., dictating Archaic policies to us poor hobbyist
     sysops on the bottom run, maybe should allow the lowly sysops, who
     have kept the Net together for years, to become part of the decision-
     making process, by requesting that the lowly sysops provide input,
     recommendations, and suggestions, to modernize our network.  Elections
     are a wonderful thing, but rather meaningless if we can really make NO
     changes.  I feel BADLY that this network that I helped SUPPORT and
     BUILD is disintegrating before my eyes because no-one is willing to
     ROCK the BOAT or make changes for fear of being singled out as a BAD
     GUY or ROGUE!

     *** Have Yourself a Microsoft Christmas***

     'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house
     Not a creature was stirring, except Papa's mouse.
     The computer was humming, the icons were hopping,
     As Papa did last-minute Internet shopping.

     The stockings were hung by the modem with care
     In hope that St. Nicholas would bring new software.
     The children were nestled all snug in their beds,
     While visions of computer games danced in their heads.
     FIDONEWS 14-50               Page 7                   15 Dec 1997


     PageMaker for Billy, and Quicken for Dan,
     And Carmen Sandiego for Pamela Ann.
     The letters to Santa had been sent out by Mom,
     To santaclaus@toyshop.northpole.com -

     Which has now been re-routed to Washington State
     Because Santa's workshop has been bought by Bill Gates.
     All the elves and reindeer have had to skedaddle
     To flashy new quarters in suburban Seattle.

     After centuries of a life that was simple and spare,
     St. Nicholas is suddenly a new billionaire,
     With a shiny red Porsche in the place of his sleigh,
     And a house on Lake Washington that's just down the way
     From where Bill has his mansion. The old fellow preens
     In black Gucci boots and red Calvin Klein jeans.
     The elves have stock options and desks with a view,
     Where they write computer code for Johnny and Sue.

     No more dolls or toy soldiers or little toy drums (ahem - pardon me)
     No more dolls or tin soldiers or little toy drums
     Will be under the tree, only compact disk ROMS
     With the Microsoft label. So spin up your drive,
     From now on Christmas runs only on Win95.

     More rapid than eagles the competitors came,
     And Bill whistled, and shouted, and called them by name.
     "Now, ADOBE! now, CLARIS! now, INTUIT! too,
     Now, APPLE! and NETSCAPE! you are all of you through,"

     It is Microsoft's SANTA that the kids can't resist,
     It's the ultimate software with a traditional twist -
     Recommended by no less than the jolly old elf,
     And on the package, a picture of Santa himself.

     Get 'em young, keep 'em long, is Microsoft's scheme,
     And a merger with Santa is a marketer's dream.
     To the top of the NASDAQ! to the top of the Dow!
     Now dash away! dash away! dash away - wow!"

     And Mama in her 'kerchief and I in my cap,
     Had just settled down for a long winter's nap,
     When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,
     The whir and the hum of our satellite platter,
     As it turned toward that new Christmas star in the sky,
     The SANTALITE owned by the Microsoft guy.
     As I sprang from my bed and was turning around,
     My computer turned on with a Jingle-Bells sound.

     And there on the screen was a smiling Bill Gates
     Next to jolly old Santa, two arm-in-arm mates.
     And I heard them exclaim in voice so bright,
     Have a MICROSOFT CHRISTMAS, and TO ALL A GOOD
     NIGHT.

     Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the nodes
             The modems were buzzing from many abodes.
     And the new soundcard I'd hid by the chimney with care,
             Had been returned by my spouse who had found it there.

     I knew kids had long since been poured in their beds
             While visions of new Apogee games danced in their heads.
     My spouse fell asleep in a chair next to me
             The computer was mine, I shouted with glee!

     When a ring on Node 1 woke me quick from my throes
             For the name on the logon thrilled me to the toes
     Away to the keyboard I tore like a flash
             Fell onto the table - broke a mouse with a crash.

     The moon on the breast of the new fallen snow
             Shone bright on the RIP screen from a user we know.
     And what to my wondering eyes did I see?
             But one SANTA CLAUS typed so very hesitatingly.

     In the NEWUSER script answered "YES" to real name,
             "North Pole" as location, the "XT" was a shame.
     He read all the rules and then to the bulletins he went.
             So perfect his logon, I was slow to get bent.

     I thought: "Download a file, you ain't got all night!"
             The menus were boring in plain black and white.
     But no interest in files this user displayed,
             And I knew that this guy might get an upgrade.

     He read all the Main Conference, then paused for a sec
             Made me wonder if the guy worked with a full deck
     And then, in a twinkling a message he typed
              When I read it, the tears from my eyes I did wipe.

     THANK YOU SYSOP, FOR THE ACCESS - YOU HAVE A GREAT BOARD
             I thought at this time the sub he couldn't afford
     HAVE A WONDERFUL CHRISTMAS, AND A BETTER NEW YEAR
             At least for a lockout he had nothing to fear.

     MRS CLAUS SENDS HER BEST AND THE ELVES SEND A GREETING
             Maybe we should invite this guy to our next meeting.
     I'LL ONLY CALL ONCE A YEAR, BUT I'LL UPLOAD A FILE!
     FIDONEWS 14-50               Page 9                   15 Dec 1997


             Just once a year? How many boards does he dial?

     After saving this message, to the RIPNet! echos he went,
             Joined the EUROPE echo quickly, and read with intent,
     Through RIPSYSOP and RIPCHAT and RIP Q&A he flew
             Even left a few messages to people I knew!

     Then upload he did - 'twas some warm Christmas text
             Made me wonder in awe at just what he'd do next
     I sprang to the kitchen a poured me a drink
             Stirred it quick with a dirty spoon right from the sink.

     Then back to the keyboard, but he'd logged off with a BYE
             No chance for a chat with this SANTA CLAUS guy.
     But I heard in the distance as I turned off the light,
             MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ALL, AND TO ALL A GOODNIGHT!

     Journal X Press Release
     FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

     FOR MORE INFORMATION:
     Kevin Bertram - (703) 938-6901 kevin@journalx.com
     Shane Ham - (202) 785-3916 shane@journalx.com

      Journal X Webzine Sends Press Release to Gain Publicity
      "We hope nobody sees through this sham," says editor.

     Journal X, a webzine devoted to politics and culture from the
     twentysomething perspective, sent a press release today in the hopes
     of gaining free publicity. Editor Kevin Bertram and Associate Editor
     Shane Ham dreamed up the idea in order to increase readership for
     their fledgling internet publication.

     "All kinds of people and organizations publicize themselves by
     convincing the media that advertising is news," said Bertram. "If it
     works on Entertainment Tonight, it should work for us."

     "Our budget is tight to say the least," said Ham. "If we can con one
     or two reporters to do a 'news' story on us, we can get our name and
     URL out without spending a penny."

     "We just hope we can find reporters who are gullible enough to fall
     for it," added Bertram.

     Journal X is a webzine devoted to political commentary, original
     fiction, and reviews of everything from movies to computer games. The
     entire staff is composed of young men and women in their twenties. It
     is published every Thursday morning, and it can be found on the World
     Wide Web at http://www.journalx.com .

     The Politics and Culture department carries both conservative and
     FIDONEWS 14-50               Page 10                  15 Dec 1997


     liberal commentators that write about the world with a cynical but
     humorous edge. The Fiction and Reviews department carries short
     stories, diaries from young people living in New York and San
     Francisco, and Journal X's most popular feature, movie reviews.

     "The previous two paragraphs are the critical ones," said Bertram.
     "We're hoping that it will move reporters to open their browsers and
     look at our zine. Once they do that, my phone will be ringing off the
     hook with interview requests."

     Journal X editors brushed aside naysayers who predicted their press
     release scam would fail. "Just open up the newspaper," said Ham. "It
     is filled with articles that couldn't even be considered news in the
     bizarro universe. If you can read about the woman who turned her doll-
     making hobby into a marginally profitable home business, you should be
     able to read about the best new webzine on the net." He added that he
     hoped his upbeat tone and superlative descriptions of Journal X would
     convince reporters that a story about the webzine would indeed be
     interesting.

     "Sure this is a cynical ploy," said Bertram, "but everyone else does
     it and it works very well for politicians and celebrities. We just
     want our piece of the pie."

     Kevin Bertram and Shane Ham are both available for interviews.

     FidoNews Article Submission Guidelines

     FidoNet address 1:1/23

     Updated 1 Jul 1997 by Christopher Baker
     Updated 29 May 1991 by Tom Jennings
     Based on the original work by Thom Henderson

     | denotes a change since the last update |.

     "Fido" and "FidoNet" are registered trademarks of Tom Jennings,
     Box 410923, San Francisco CA 94141, USA and are used with
     permission.

     --------
     SYNOPSIS:

     FidoNews is the newsletter of the FidoNet computer network, its
     Sysops and users.  It is passed to its readers electronically via
     the FidoNet and other computer networks and to non-network
     readers as well.

     This document intends to tell you how to write and submit
     articles for publication in FidoNews. Much of it describes the
     technical specifications which an article must meet in order to
     be included in the newsletter, as well as broad (very) guidelines
     on content. (Of course you realize articles can be submitted only
     electronically.) Please read it carefully. The article you save
     might be your own.


     ------------
     INTRODUCTION:

     FidoNews was originally founded in early 1984 to include all
     parts of the lives of its member Sysops and users, which of
     course means not just technical matters. We do not have fixed
     goals of maximum distribution or maximum readership (i.e. lowest
     common denominator) but only to meet the needs of our individual
     network members. The success of this venture has always been
     contentious at best (ahem).

     In any case the grand experiment continues. Twelve years later
     (at this writing) and over 30,000 Nodes in the network, the
     editorial policy, or lack of one, of FidoNews has shown to
     best fit our ever-changing and unpredictable needs.


     --------------
     SUBJECT MATTER:

     Articles on any subject of interest to FidoNet members and users
     FIDONEWS 14-50               Page 13                  15 Dec 1997


     are welcome and encouraged, not necessarily of a technical
     nature, though priority may be, but not necessarily, given to
     articles of importance to the FidoNet, its technology and its
     uses; other networks such as uucp and the Internet; social
     aspects of communications; ethical issues; other related matters.


     --------------
     ARTICLE LENGTH:

     Try to keep articles short. The longer it is, the less likely
     people are to read it. Consider splitting long articles (more
     than five pages) into smaller articles to be run serially.
     Exceptions will be made at the whim of the editors.

     For practical reasons, we will attempt to keep FidoNews to a
     "reasonable size", which is of course a highly subjective and
     variable thing. As of May 1991, the goal is under 100,000 bytes.
     Decisions regarding content may be made based upon this, though
     in general it shouldn't be an issue.


     ------------------
     WRITING GUIDELINES:

     We are not all professional writers, nor is that even a goal for
     the FidoNews -- we want real communication to and from real
     people; even at the expense of so-called "good writing", which is
     frequently a tool to exclude. There are a few minimum
     requirements though for any successful writing, even for the
     lowly FidoNews:

     * The subject discussed must be clear to people other than the
       author! Don't assume that people will pick up the context from
       your writing. Tell them explicitly.

     * Why are you writing this? It may seem obvious -- "Review of the
       new Acme 75-baud Modem" -- but it's not. Are you the
       manufacturer? An irate customer? Let us know your point of
       view.

     * Who are you? A good question! Anonymity is acceptable, though
       most people want to take credit for their work. Include full
       contact information including electronic mail addresses.

     * Articles submitted via Netmail or email must contain all the
       technically required lines and delimiters in the BODY of the
       message.  This includes the *[title] line and the 70 character
       width requirement. To indicate the filename type for one of
       these message submissions, place the FILENAME.TYP in the Subj:
       line of your email, Netmail, or Echomail. Those that require
       extra editing may be delayed from appearing in FidoNews.

     * Articles will appear when space becomes available, not
       necessarily the "next" issue. If your article is of a time-
       critical nature, please say so when you submit it; the editor
     FIDONEWS 14-50               Page 14                  15 Dec 1997


       still has final say.

     * The editor reserves the right to request changes from an author
       to meet these "standards", which you have to admit are pretty
       loose. It is not the intent for this to be a mechanism to
       refuse articles the editor does not like, but simply to keep
       the contents intelligible.

     * If we have a backlog of articles, we may get fussier about
       things. Historically, this has not been a serious problem.


     ---------------------
     SUBMITTING AN ARTICLE

     TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

     If all that hasn't scared you away, the next step is to create a
     text file which contains the text of your article. The resulting
     file should be sent or uploaded to "Editor", FidoNet
     address 1:1/23. The "physical" location (and phone number) of
     FidoNews varies, and hence must be found elsewhere, such as
     within a recent copy of FidoNews itself.


     Filenames must follow the MSDOS standard:

         FILENAME.TYP

         a 1 to 8 character file name (A - Z, 0 - 9)
         a period,
         a 0 to 3 character file type (A - Z, 0 - 9)


     File types are used to distinguish types of submissions, as
     follows:

         .LET Letters to the Editor.
         .ART An article, commentary, open letter, or general news
              item.
         .GUE Want to write a Guest Editorial? [*Name & Node on line 1]
         .RTX Need to make a Retraction of a previous article or notice?
         .COL Want to become a regular contributor with your own column?
         .ANS Answers to the Question of the Week.
         .BIO FidoNet biographies - tell us your | personal | story.
     |   .TRU True stories of FidoNet. |
         .HIS FidoNet history - got an anecdote to share?
         .REV Reviews of related product, services, or programs.
         .JOK Net humor in print.
     |   .FIC FidoNet (computer related) short fiction. |
         .CMX Comics in ASCII. [watch those lines at 70 columns!]
     |        [.CMX that are political will be renamed to .GUE] |
         .PRF Want to Proofread? Get a cookie for spotting errors.
         .AD  Advertising FREE services or events.
         .SAL "For Sale"
         .WAN "Wanted"
     FIDONEWS 14-50               Page 15                  15 Dec 1997


         .NOT A notice for the back of the issue. Keep them short.
         .INT Internet addresses for FidoNet webpages of general interest.

     If your file doesn't have one of the above extensions, then it
     will lay around taking up disk space until someone takes a look
     at it and realizes what it is. Maybe.

     The name of the file is up to you, though you should use a name
     which is not likely to be "stepped on" by someone else -- the
     system will not guarantee file names are unique. For example,
     FNEWS.ART is probably not a good name for an article.


     --------------
     CHARACTER SETS:

     The character by character contents of the file itself must meet
     the following standards or it cannot be published in FidoNews.
     The FidoNews staff WILL NOT be responsible for making file
     contents conform to these standards.

     * FLUSH LEFT MARGIN: Please do not put a "left margin" on your
       articles. Have the text start at the very first column.

     * RIGHT MARGIN AT COLUMN 70 OR LESS: Less is tolerable, more is
       definitely not.  If your cursor is resting at column 71 when
       your line is ended, you're okay.  One character past that even
       with trailing spaces and MAKENEWS will barf on your submission.
       If your submission is physically rejected, the Editor will have
       to fix it manually or send it back for reformatting.

     * RAGGED-RIGHT TEXT: Word-Star style "justification" (inserting
       spaces into sentences so that a paragraph is perfectly rec-
       tangular) is extremely hard to read, and consumes needless space.
       Please don't use it!

     * NO FUNNY CHARACTERS: This includes formfeeds, returns without
       linefeeds, linefeeds without returns, tabs and other oddities.
       The only control codes (character codes 0 through 31 decimal)
       allowed are carriage return (CR) and linefeed (LF). The only
       exception is: Control-Z "end of file" terminator characters are
       tolerated. Not required.

     * NO GRAPHICS CHARACTERS: Believe it or not, not everyone in the
       world has an IBM PC. Please restrict yourself to printable
       ASCII characters in the range 20 hex to 7E hex (space to
       tilde).

     * LINES TERMINATED: Each line in the article should be terminated
       with a 'newline' -- either the MSDOS standard (CR/LF) or the
       unix standard (LF only).


     -----------------
     SUBMISSION FORMAT:

     Below is a sample article properly formatted. Features of it are
     discussed further below.

     --article file example begins below this line--
     *A Sample Article [this is in LINE 1 starting at COLUMN 1]

     This is My Title
     by Joe Schmoe, [Netmail/email address]

     And here is my article. Note that it is flush left (zero indent).
     Also note that the right margin is at column seventy so that it
     won't overflow "most" text windows. Each line has a newline. Note
     the *'ed first line. My article will be listed in the table of
     contents exactly as it appears after the * above.

     Figure 1.                       Table 1.
             +-------+               ========
             | A Box |                  Alpha
             +-------+                 Bravo

     Note that we am not using any funny-o characters. This ensures
     that the final article will look the same to every user, no
     matter what sort of hardware he has.

     This is the last sentence of our article.

     --article file example ends above this line--


     The FIRST line of text is the Table of Contents line. It MUST
     begin with an asterisk * as shown above.  NO BLANK lines above
     title line are permitted. If you do not follow this instruction
     exactly, the article will not be listed in the Table of Contents.
     This Table of Contents listing method works for all submission
     file types.

     * Everything that follows the *'ed line will appear in the body
       of the newsletter.  The *'ed line will be stripped out of your
       article text so if you want it repeated as your title in the
       article BE SURE to | REPEAT | it on a second line without the *.

     * Next should be the title or name of your article, your name,
       and contact information (network address(es), Postal Service
       address, etc) Try to keep it to one or two lines each.

     * Put a blank line between paragraphs. Paragraphs that all run
       together are very difficult to read, and may be rejected.

     * If you want to put in a table or a figure, go right ahead.
       We do not rearrange text, so your table or figure will
       remain exactly as you entered it. Try to limit them to ones
       that make the communication CLEARER.

     * Don't put a lot of blank space at the top or bottom. The
       FidoNews-generator programs will visually separate articles
       automatically.

     * Please check for basic errors in spelling, grammar, and
       punctuation. We're not publishing a textbook, but you don't
       want it to embarrass yourself do you?

     * Don't use FidoNews to grind your personal axes against other
       FidoNet members. An article presenting a side of an internal
       dispute is one thing. An article defaming or perseverating over
       several Issues is another. Articles that merely quote endlessly
       from other sources to no particular effect are also not a good
       idea.

     * Don't republish copyrighted material from other sources WITHOUT
