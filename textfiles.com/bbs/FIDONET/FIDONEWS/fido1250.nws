The Demise of Net 2805 a rebuttal

By Marge Robbins 1:283/120

It never ceases to amaze me to what lengths people will go to
both  cause  trouble and smear the good names of honest
hardworking Fidonet coordinators of any level.  Mr. Sherwick
does not deserve the abuse he has been taking in this and
related matters.

Let me take a moment to rebutt the accusations contained in
Brent Hamm's article in last week's snooze.

First of all, Mr. Hamm has been excommunicated and that
excommunication has been upheld by both RC14 Steve Sherwick and
ZC1 Bob Satti. That gives him no standing whatsoever in this
matter. Nevertheless he sees fit to attempt to reogranize a net
naming himself as Network Coordinator. Anybody see anything
wrong with this scenario?

BH>Where do you get off disbanding an ENTIRE network without
telling anyone about it?

 When NC Will Wright announced his intention of stepping down
as Network coordinator, the rest of the net was notified by RC14
and given the choice of chosing a new NC or becoming regional
independents. Nobody responded.  Since makenl has a decided
objection to a network without a network coordinator listed, Mr.
Sherwick had no option but to dissolve the network.

BH>Accordingly, we wish to form a new network. We have met all
the BH>requirements of Section 2.4 of Policy 4.07. Here is the
BH>nodelist segment. It's also file attached as NET2805.342.

Two problems with this. An excommunicated node not only doesn't
have a node number, he cannot hold a coordinator position.
Secondly, network coordinators are APPOINTED by the Regional
Coordinator.  Mr. Sherwick has not appointed Brent Hamm or
anyone else to this postion. He asked for a volunteer and got no
response.

The bottom line here is that while the remaining nodes in the
now defunct net 2805 are still members of Fidonet and do have
the option of either reorganizing their net or becoming Regional
Independents, Mr. Hamm has no standing in this matter and his
attempt to reform the net by submitting a bogus nodelist segment
is ludicrous in the extreme.

What We Stand For
Damian Stamm (1:273/406)

The land of freedom. Home of the brave. Land of opportunity.
Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. All of which we have
been raised.

With the exception of a few. A few who care more about their
own pathetic egos, and less about the actual net.

Our lovely ZC B.S. has decided that he will back inexhonorably
the views of an interim RC. Hence, any comments against the
almighty one will constitute excommunication from the electronic
world of Fidonet.

Guess I'll have to find a new moderator for NBA_ECHO.

What does it say about a person when their whole livelyhood is
based around a computer, where their egos and self confidence
are fueled by the need to be recognized by people who they will
never meet in person in their lifetime? What does it say about
people who make "power" grabs, post as often as they can in Z1*
echoes,  and/or  threaten anything from excommunication to
lawsuits to get people's attention to recognize that they exist?

What matters most to people like B.S. is that people recognize
who he is. That they know he's the ZC, that he's a "president"
of Fidonet. Irrelevant what Fidonet does, what its purpose is
(as a hobby,) but most importantly that he sees his name on his
screen without having to bother to write it himself.

Why is it that B.S. is so scared of criticism that he'll
excommunicate someone as a sign of brotherhood for a fellow Mike
Walsh wannabe?

And how DID B.S. get re-elected in the first place?

There have been many a cry for a new "Policy 5," ditching the
currect virus text that is held so dearly by those in power. In
B.S.'s and their eyes, a legitamate democratic system would be
disasterous, as any questioning of their leadership might end
their possible "power," and they couldn't pull off a Tiennamen
Square excommunication blitz and stay in power.

So until then B.S. will be in power. B.S. and his cronies will
be lined up as RC's and will back him and stroke his ego like
7-year-old with a new puppy.

Now to see how long it takes for my node number to be
revoked........

bbsdoors a better BBS Door echo
by: Rob Mooney
    1:323/1017

BBSDOORS echo was formed by me Rob Mooney just recently due to the
unjust and inappropriate heavy handed censorship that I've found in
another of the fidonet echo's that deals with BBS Doors.

This echo completely deal's with BBS Doors, their technical support,
Distribution and online Registration site's, new releases & update's
for all doors for all BBS platforms. I am hoping to have ALL Door
Authors new and old join this echo and offer their support to
everyone who is here.

If you've ever wanted to know about a BBS Door before you've spent
the time and money to download or freq it, or you are sick of reading
nonsense messages from people who have no aim in life other than to
flame a Door Author or complain about a Door because they have had
a hard time with it and elected not to take the time to seek proper
support then this is the place for you.

I can guarantee that everyone who joins this echo will be treated the
same. NO favoritism will be shown to ANYONE at all. Comply with the
very basic set of rules and you'll be OK!

For more information of how to receive this echo or to help me with my
endeavor to get BBSDOORS on the backbone please contact Rob Mooney at
1:323/1017.
