                           A New Year, A New Net


       Well,  not really a new net.  Maybe just one that's a little
       easier to figure out.

       FidoNet  has  grown  a  lot  over  the  past few years.  Its
       organization has changed a  few  times  to  accommodate  its
       increased   size.   The  latest  change  was  when  multinet
       operation was added,  distributing control  of  the  net  to
       dozens of people scattered all over the place.

       Sometimes  this  has  caused  confusion.  A  plaintive sysop
       demanding "Who's in charge here?" might  have  a  hard  time
       finding out.  Many people seem unsure just how to get a node
       number,  or  how  form  a net,  or where to turn when things
       don't seem to be working right.

       Some policies have been developed since  multinet  operation
       was established,  but not much has been said about what they
       are.  A new coordinator or net host has a hard time figuring
       out how everything works.

       So a FidoNet Policy and Procedures Guide has been  compiled,
       and  is  being distributed with this issue of Fidonews.  The
       guide doesn't set any new policies,  it just  describes  the
       ones  we  already  have.  We  think  you'll find it a useful
       reference.

       Fido 10/624

               Running Fido with a Cermetek 1200 SPC Modem

       I just bought a Cermetek half-card modem for my Fido system.
       This is a more-or-less Hayes-compatible 1200 baud modem
       which sells for $199 at Fry's Electronics in Sunnyvale (and
       probably at similar prices elsewhere).

       The modem seems very nice so far.  The obvious differences
       from a stand-alone modem are the lack of indicator lights
       and the terrible speaker.  I don't find these to be much of
       a problem.  The main problem was that the generic Hayes
       setup for Fido doesn't work.

       Fortunately, there is a simple fix.  On the command line for
       Fido, you need to specify 16/v instead of the more common
       128/v.  This will get Fido to look at the correct bit for
       carrier detect.

       You need to set up the modem for auto-answer (DIP switch 4
       off), and set up the modem for numeric codes.  Numeric codes
       can be had by default by setting DIP switch 3 on, or you can
       leave it off and create a FIDOMDM.BBS file with the line

       ATV0

       in it.  This will turn off the English-language status
       messages and use the Hayes numeric codes.

       All other settings can be left at their defaults.

       John Plocher
       Fido 121/90
                          Fido Related Ramblings

        Ever  since  I started using Fido about a year and  a  half
       ago, I have been bothered a bit about the way FidoNet is set
       up.  Why must FidoNet be a synchronous event?    Namely, why
       is  there a distinction between a person calling  your  Fido
       and   another  Fido  calling  it?    There  is   already   a
       verification  scheme  in  Fido which makes sure that  it  is
       talking to a Fido and not a user,  so why restrict the times
       when systems can access each other?

        If  I  want to send mail to you,  I need to  generate  your
       outgoing packet,  call up your machine, send the packet. You
       don't need to do anything with that packet till you want to.
       If  you wait till after the national mail slot to unpack it,
       so  what.    Things  would still run as  they  do  now.  If,
       however,  you  set up your event schedule so that the unpack
       routine  got called every 2 or 3 hours,  your  system  could
       have a faster 'message response time'.

        This would also remove a bottleneck which exists right now:
       the  mail  slot can run out before you got done sending  all
       your outgoing mail.

        Allowing  a  Fido to make outgoing calls  anytime  wouldn't
       mean  that  you would have to make changes in  your  current
       routing setup if you didn't want to change your habits.  All
       that  this would do is remove the restriction that the  Fido
       you  want to talk to has scheduled a mail event at the  same
       time  you do.  Remember,  routing files only effect  SENDING
       mail!

        Also,  why can't (?shouldn't?) I be able to tell the  local
       "Fido"  system to call a remote "Fido" and request info from
       it like:

        FORWARD MY MAIL
        LIST DIRECTORIES
        LIST FILES IN directory
        DOWNLOAD file
        UPLOAD file

        I could then leave a "message" on my local machine which
       would result in my getting the latest version of RENUM from
       Bob's system or a list of the file areas on one of the St.
       Louis systems. I could also allow normal users (if they
       have credit) easy access to files on other systems.

         All right,  I know Fido will never allow this since Tom J.
       has said that 10l,  will be his last version (I haven't  the
       foggiest  who did 11a),  but if Bob Hartman reads  this,  it
       might rub off onto Rover.   If it does,  I'll provide a flea
       collar!

         Thanx  for 'listening' to my ramblings!

                             Computerists Form
              International Computer Users Groups Association


            Incorporation  papers  will  be  filed  next  week   in
       Lexington,   Kentucky   for  a  new  non-profit  scientific,
       literary,  educational and  charitable  organization  to  be
       known   as   the   International   Computer   Users   Groups
       Association, Inc. (ICUGA).

            The organization,  being incorporated  by  computerists
       from  four  states,  is designed to aid local computer users
       groups in promoting use of computers and themselves  and  to
       allow computer users groups to share information.

            "The idea is to allow computer users groups to speak to
       one  another,  to  know  more  of the trends of the computer
       industry and to  help  them  better  serve  their  members,"
       explained  David  Reed,  one  of  the  founders of ICUGA and
       president of the Central Kentucky Computer Society, Inc. "We
       are writing to all known computer users groups inviting them
       to join with us in forming this  organization.  We  want  to
       have as much input as possible from the various users groups
       and  are offering them the opportunity to have a role in the
       formation of policy and direction for this organization."

            Charter dues for ICUGA will be only $25 per users group
       and will enable member organizations to help form the future
       plans of the international organization.

            Among the ideas being considered by  ICUGA  is  an  800
       number  to  allow new computerists to call to find out about
       member users groups in their area;  a  newsletter  for  user
       group presidents;  a clearing house of information for those
       wishing to form new users groups; a speakers' bureau to help
       users groups learn of those willing to make presentations to
       groups; working with computer manufacturers and suppliers to
       obtain user group discounts for ICUGA-member  organizations;
       to  provide  an exchange service for newsletter articles for
       local user group publications;  to provide a liaison between
       member  users  groups  and other non-profit organizations to
       allow computer groups to perform public service  activities;
       and  to explore other aspects of the organization which will
       benefit the local users groups.

            "We've just gone through 15  months  of  growing  pains
       with   our  new  local  computer  society  and  realize  how
       difficult it is for a local group to gain information  about
       how  to form a group and what is needed to obtain non-profit
       tax and mailing status and  suggested  by-laws  for  such  a
       group,"  Reed  explained.  "After  talking with various user
       group  presidents  around  the  country,   it   appears   an
       organization such as ICUGA is needed.  We don't want to be a
       parent organization for  users  groups  --  just  a  support
       service for them, allowing them to use whichever services we
       offer as they decide locally."

            ICUGA  will  incorporate  as  a  non-profit corporation

       under Kentucky law and will  seek  501  (3)  (c)  tax-exempt

       Fido utilities, part 1 : The "complete" list
       --------------------------------------------

       by Henk Wevers Fido 3101/1

       Many times I wished there was a complete list  of  available
       Fido utilities with a short description of what each utility
       does  and  where  to  find  it.  If  you know that I live in
       Holland,  Europe you will understand my point.  Its  awfully
       expensive  to  browse  through the software of many Fido sys-
       tems.  Well, the list is here now for the same reason that a
       lot of Fido software is "popping" up:  if it doesn't  exist,
       do it yourself.  I hope this list will help you,  especially
       if you are rather new to the Fido scene.  I will try to make
       this a three part article with the different parts published
       about a month after each other. This first part merely lists
       all Fido utility software I am aware  of,  the  second  part
       explains how to use a lot of these utilities in a batch file
       letting  Fido taking care of most of its maintenance (THAT's
       different from a real dog!) and the third part  talks  about
       how  to use some of these freestanding utilities to make the
       life of a Fido dog owner much easier.

       The list of available Fido utilities  following  this  intro
       and the upcoming articles will be distributed as three files
       so  new sysops can pickup easely from there.  I hope to keep
       the first file called FIDOUTIL.DC1 current,  but I need your
       help  here.  Note  that I have only included programs I have
       tried out.  There may be a lot of other utilities I  am  not
       aware of.  Please let me know if you use some other utility.
       I  really  wouldn't mind if you attach it to the message you
       are going to send to me.  Beware,  the message and files  go
       straight  to europe,  it may cost you a little here.  If you
       tell me where I can find it,  and the program looks  interes-
       ting  I will probably pick it up some day.  And oh yes,  the
       comments on the programs  are  mine  and  very  personal.  I
       don't try to be offensive here,  I really appriciate all the
       work done to make a Fido utility.  It just happens  that  we
       have  some duplicates here and that some programs do the job
       in a better way for my situation.  Anyway,  If you object or
       want to add something to my comments, just let me know.

       number of programs. If I have seen things wrong, just let me
       know and I will correct them as soon as you convinced me.

                Nobody  can run Fido without this neat program.  It
                must be run on the distributed node list to  get  a
                working node list and route files for Fido

                ---------------------------------------------------
                User files can become big, especially with one time
                callers.  With  TJ's  SYS_XXX user file maintenance
                program you can purge the users you want,  but that
                means  leaving  Fido  and manually starting the pro-
                gram.  PRGUSERS does the  same,  but  automatically
                from batch using an external event. Keen sysops use
                this.

                Read messages outside Fido.  The only reason to use
                this one instead of several others is that you  can
                print  the message to a file.  As soon as Rover can
                print messages you can delete this one.

                If your users get a low first time  privilege  then
                you  must  upgrade  them  manually  by  reading the
                ANSWERS or ANEWUSER file  and  then  updating  them
                with  TJ's SYS_XXX.  A long and time consuming way.
                Well this program does all that and you can  append
                the answer file to a XX.SAV file,  so you can start
                with a fresh file next time.  The program is OK and
                saves a lot of time,  but the speed of the  program
                could use a lot of improvement.

                A companion to PRGUSERS.  This one can renumber and
                delete  messages  from  batch  (actually simulating
                sysop's 2 and 8 commands).  I don't see how you can
                do without this one.

                but it got lost somewhere and never arrived. If you
                are like me, you hate to type in things twice.  Use
                RESEND instead.  If you marked your message  to  be
                killed  after  sending,  you  have run out of luck.
                You can do some little tricks with this  one,  like
                regular  distribution of files,  but most of us use
                ROBOT for these kinds of things.

                Used to distribute messages and files on a  regular
                basis,  like  Fidonews,  node  list updates,  route
                files, etc.  Hosts must have it,  and will probably

                What can I say?  I use it every day. It's a mimicry
                of Fido's message base but has some cute extensions
                like editing already saved files and  editing  with
                your  favorite  word  processor.  Will  grow into a
                complete Fidoclone (with sources I hope).  The only
                thing I miss is the ability to send  messages  read
                to  the  printer or a file (like twix,  but for all
                areas as a sysop only command).  Get this one !

                Should be better than the original TJ's TWIX,  that
                doesn't know about nets.  Yeach...  this one  mixes
                up  the nets too,  so no big deal (yet).  Still you
                must get this one or TWIX, they both will print all
                unread message in the mail area.  Run it every  mor-
                ning to get a hard copy of your new mail.

                Emulates  the  SYS_XXX  file  to  maintain the user
                list.  You can start this from inside Fido with the
                0 command.  Good for remote sysops (you should have
                one during the holidays anyway).  If  you're  gonna
                use this make sure you run watchdog too !

                ---------------------------------------------------
                In an effort to make a list of all Fido users,  you
                are asked to run this program on your user list and
                ship the result  to  107/1.  They  will  compile  a
                nationwide  (worldwide  ??)  "Fido" book so you can
                look up where to send someone a message. Personally
                I think this is a goal that can't  be  achieved  as
                Fido grows as fast as it does now.  Most likely  it
                will  gobble  up all available disk space next year
                or so.  Still,  if Fido's too  big  we'll  probably
                split  up the book in different parts for different
                countries and regions, so keep sending the files to
                107/1.

                for  maintaining  your  files  and  FILES.BBS files
                (thats a lot of files  in  this  sentence,  do  you

                Another Fido Classic. (What Classic?  Fido is still
                a puppy!) I run this one as a batch file every week
                at  23:59  on  Saturday.  It  provides  me  with  a
                comprehensive sysop log,  utilization report and  a
                report on up and downloads.  If you want to analyze
                your  system's  usage this program can also make an
                import file for DBII and others.

                If  you are going to use the "0" command  you  MUST
                use watchdog. Otherwise if you get disconnected the
                next caller can drop into DOS. Watchdog reboots the
                system   after  the  carrier  is  lost.   With   an
                appropriate AUTOEXEC.BAT file Fido will restart.

                Like DAYNBR and ROBOT, useful in batch files. Exits

       It's available on ALL Fido systems. Oh well, here we go:

                              Rainbow Corner
                           by Theodore Needleman

       Reader Mail...

       As  usual,  first  order  of  business is reader mail.  B.R.
       McMahon,  a volunteer  instructor  for  the  Senior  Citizen
       Activities  Program  in  Colorado Springs,  calls me to task
       about April's column.  He  has  some  questions  about  (and
       criticisms  on  the  use  of)  computer  jargon.  Well,  Mr.
       McMahon, I apologize.  Not for the use of jargon,  after all
       every  discipline  has  its  own  vocabulary,  but  for  not
       defining some terms as I went along.  Sometimes I forget how
       frustrating it is to be just starting out and have  everyone
       talking over your head.  To address your questions, Terminal
       Mode  is  the Rainbow's built in Terminal Emulation program.
       When  you  turn  on  the  system,  after  the  self-test  is
       completed,  you  are provided with a screen which asks which
       drive you wish to boot from.  If you choose  "T"  from  this
       menu, you will be in "Terminal Mode".

       Mr.   McMahon's  letter  goes  on  to  ask  where  in  DEC's
       documentation the information about Terminal Mode and  Print
       Screen  is  located,  and  requests  a definition of "Screen
       Dump".  Well, sir,  "Screen Dump" is jargon for transferring
       whatever's  on  the  CRT  into hardcopy via the printer.  In
       other words,  performing a "Print Screen".  The  information
       about Terminal Mode is to be found in the Rainbow 100 User's
       Guide  in Chapter 4 ("Communicating with Another Computer"),
       and the description of the "Print Screen" function is on the
       last page of that chapter under "Using a Printer".  Granted,
       you do have to hunt a bit for it, but it is in there (and in
       the index to the User's Guide).  I do agree with you that it
       is not particularly easy to "zero-in" on a specific piece of
       information. A "Master" index, covering the "Owner's" Guide,
       "User's" Guide,  and CPM/86-80 and MS-DOS manuals would seem
       to  be  a  good  idea.  This  would direct you not only to a
       particular page,  but also a specific manual.  This wouldn't
       be any big deal to do (just merge the four current indexes),
       but  I don't see anyone at DEC being particularly anxious to
       do it.

       Next letter is from Michael Victoroff M.D.  who  writes  (in
       part)   "Please   continue  all  possible  sarcasm,   jibes,
       needling,  and other taunting of the (...people) at DEC  who
       don't see the importance of PC's".

       You've  got  it,  Mike.  But it's important that you and the
       other "Corner" readers realize that I don't do  this  simply
       to  be  vile-tempered  or  curmudgeonly.  The simple fact is
       that I, like the rest of you,  own a Rainbow,  and I want to
       use it as something more than a expensive paperweight (hell,
       I already have an Apple /// for that!) So it tends to get me
       a bit upset when DEC blows a beautiful piece of hardware out
       of  the  water  with inept marketing (for DEC's latest gaff,
       see this week's Business Software Beat).  It's easy  to  use
       (or  misuse)  these forums as a vehicle to vent some spleen,
       but that's not really the point of my tirades and  rantings.

       The  object  is  to express both (from the letters I've been
       receiving,) your, and my own, displeasure at the way DEC has
       been handling the Rainbow.  There's an old adage  that  "the
       squeaky  wheel  gets  the grease".  Maybe if we all "squeak"
       loud enough...

       Reader John  Wheeler  writes  in  asking  about  a  port  of
       Sublogic's (and Microsoft's) Flight Simulator.  Sorry, John,
       there  are  two factors precluding a port of this particular
       program to the Rainbow.  The first  of  these  is  that  the
       program  is copy-protected.  To copy the software onto RX-50
       diskettes, you'd first have to break, and take out, the copy
       protection.  Even if it  was  possible  to  get  the  Flight
       Simulator  onto a DEC format disk,  it still wouldn't run on
       the Rainbow.  The reason this particular package is used  as
       a  test  of  IBM-PC compatibility is that it makes extensive
       use of the PC graphics mode.  And, as we all know,  graphics
       on  the  IBM,  and  graphics  on  the Rainbow,  are two very
       different animals.

       John also goes on to ask what kind of support and assistance
       a software vendor can expect to receive in porting a program
       over to the Rainbow.  Actually, John, this is one area where
       DEC is doing a good job.  DEC is prepared to offer not  only
       marketing  assistance,  but technical assistance as well.  A
       special ISV (Independent Software Vendor) support group  has
       been  formed  for  this  purpose.  Jim  Alosi,  who has been
       mentioned several times before here  at  the  "Corner",  has
       been  named  ISV  Support & Development Manager.  I speak to
       Jim fairly often,  and I believe that  he  is  committed  to
       getting as much software as possible up on the Rainbow.  All
       my jibes at the DEC bureaucracy aside,  Jim and his team did
       a tremendous job on the Referral Guide,  and I  expect  that
       his  Support  &  Development  group  will  be  an invaluable
       resource in getting software ported over to the Rainbow.  He
       requests that any software  vendors  interested  in  getting
       their  programs  ported  on the Rainbow contact him (by mail
       ONLY,  please!) His address is:  Jim Alosi,  ISV  Support  &
       Development Manager,  LJ02/14,  Digital Equipment Corp.,  30
       Porter Road, Littleton, MA. 01460.

       Speaking of porting software,  my "Project  Transport"  (May
       issue)  proposal has generated a bit of mail,  most of it in
       favor of the project.  However, at this writing,  not enough
       input has come in to make worthwhile the enormous investment
       in time required for such an undertaking.  Now granted,  not
       a lot of time has passed.  Due to the "publishing lag",  the
       May  issue  of  Hardcopy  has only been out about 3 weeks as
       this is being written.  The "powers that be" at the magazine
       tell me we have over 30,000 Rainbow owners reading Hardcopy.
       I'd like to see input from at least 1% of you before I  make
       a  decision.  I  know most of you never write to a magazine,
       after all, I very rarely write to magazines either.  But I'm
       asking you to make an exception in this case.  I'll hold off
       making a "go/no-go" decision on  "Project  Transport"  until
       August 1st.  If you haven't already given me your "two cents
       worth",  please  take  a moment to do so now.  The addresses
       are: paper mail to IDEA TECHNOLOGY, P.O.  Box 668, New City,

       NY 10956, MCIMail to "Theodore Needleman", and SourceMail to
       TCA920.  A  good turn-out will be impressive not only to the
       software producers  I'll  approach  if  "Project  Transport"
       takes  off,  but  will  demonstrate  to  DEC  that  there is
       considerable interest in keeping the Rainbow alive and well.

       I'm about out of room for  this  week,  though  not  out  of
       reader  mail.  Oh  well,  maybe there will be a bit of extra
       room next week!  One last thing before I sign  off.  Several
       readers  have  taken  me  to task about the sparse mention I
       made of the FIDONET system.  No slight was intended.  I hope
       to sign on a few more FIDO BBS around the country during the
       next  week.   I'll  report  on  this,   and   the   "FIDONET
       Philosophy"  in a bit more detail next week.  Also coming up
       next week are "mini-reviews"  on  a  public  domain  program
       called  DAC,  and on "DO-IT" from VU-SOFT.  And,  of course,
       reader mail! See you then.
