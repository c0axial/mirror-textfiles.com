     =================================================================

     FidoNet is up for a software association award according to email I
     received and passed along to Tom Jennings. I'll pass along any other
     info that comes my way.

     By the time this comes out, the Zone 3 Coordinator election should be
     over. There is an article here that gives details of the process but
     since it's already yesterday down under, the info is just for info and
     not for action. Too many time zones. [grin]

     Several Zone 2 folks have signed up to be added to the FidoNet webring
     in the past month or so but they are not putting the required code
     blurb for the webring mechanics on their listed pages. The webring
     only works when there is something on each page that will transport
     the surfer to the next site in the webring. I send email to each page
     meister but there may be language problems that are preventing my
     message from being understood. No page can be added UNTIL that piece
     of code is incorporated into their page so the webring is actually a
     ring of links. Webring site info is in the Masthead. Anyone who has a
     FidoNet related page can go there and sign up for inclusion. The
     required code blurb and GIFs are there with instructions. Your page
     doesn't have to be an official Net or Region site if you have FidoNet-
     related links on your page.

     There is a new ZEC1 listed in my Nodelist but I've received nothing of
     notice for publication. Hey, it's only Echomail. [snicker]

     Our first Asian page [other than the Z6 page] is listed this week in
     China. The details are in Chinese but some of it is in English.

     Are we having fun yet?

     Chopping Broccoli
     by Gregg Jennings, 1:331/109, grejen@cape.com

     Jewish international bankers financed the Napoleonic wars
     and World War I, but these were nothing compared to World
     War II. Hitler knew what the Jews were planning and he tried
     to prevent it--that's why he invaded those other countries,
     to get rid of the Jews, just as he did in Germany. They were
     plotting a war to destroy the world, so they could take
     over. But no one understood and in the end the Jew-financed
     armies won the war. The Jews killed Hitler just like they
     killed Our Saviour. History repeats itself, and that's a
     fact too.

     Taking off the inflatable armband we find that many reader's
     blood pressure has just gone up.

     The words in the first paragraph are from a short story,
     "The Rubber Room", by Robert Bloch (a great story by a
     great writer). They are not mine.

     Your blood pressure now goes back to normal, because it's
     just a quote, just an example, just fiction (and the main
     character of the story, the one who spoke those words, in
     the end gets his do).

     Now, what if I did mean it? You can't despise the words,
     those particular words in that particular order, as used in
     this commentary, now that you know what is behind them.

     Is it only when the person behind the words means what he
     says that we should get mad? Is it the belief in the words
     that is despicable and not the words themselves?

     What if I stated that I believed in the words but really did
     not? Are the words then despicable and the writer not?

     It is the reader's fault when he or she gets angered,
     incensed, or upset by someone's words, not the writer's.
     Whether the words are in EchoMail, FidoNews, or any
     publication.

     There goes your blood pressure again!

     Free your mind instead.

     We lost a friend

     By Ward Dossche

     In the middle of holidays, which are supposed to be happy times, I was
     struck by the horrible news that Louis Van Geel died.

     Why should that concern anyone else but me? Why is this an event
     worthy for mentioning in Fidonews?

     Maybe things aren't all that clear for younger people in zone-2 (and
     elsewhere) but Louis is a giant among sysops who dreamed further than
     most of us did, forced breakthroughs where others saw no solutions,
     created opportunities and shared with others.

     He invented the word 'netiquette' to define a few simple basic rules
     of Fidonet-behaviour "ask and you shall get". He co-pioneered
     tunnelling via the internet while this was a technology largely
     unknown to us. He had the vision to launch himself (and some of us
     too) into ventures such as educational stuff via K12 (then unknown in
     zone-2), backboned operations for the whole zone.

     When a modem was broken Louis always had a spare-one somewhere, there
     was always a listening ear for problems and when he could help out he
     would.

     Louis was not an angel, he had his human weak sides such as everyone
     of us.  That only serves however to demonstrate that he was one of us
     and among us, not above us!

     Louis had left Fidonet already some years ago; nevertheless he has
     made a lasting impression that will live on in the minds of those that
     knew him.

     When I learned about the dreaded disease that got to him, it was like
     a blow to myself and all those to whom I conveyed the news. Louis put
     up a fight but finally modern science had no further solutions to
     offer.

     Cancer got him down as a person, but through his achievements he lives
     on in our daily activities in Fidonet.

     He leaves behind a lovely wife and a son who don't deserve this sad
     twist of fate.

     Louis, where-ever you are, if we can find the right software to
     interface with the dimension where you are now, be assured that we
     will set-up a gateway ... so much still needs being explored and your
     place is among us!

     Election is currently under way with a large slate of candidates.
     [Grin] I'll go dig out some stuff from the sysop echoes to feed your
     curiosity.  At this stage it's anyone's guess who will get up: Teddy
     (Denise Webber) is popular but there are doubts about her technical
     capabilities.  Alwyn Smith has a good chance methinks.

     ---[Begin]------------------------------------------------------------

          From: Chris Maddock
          To  : Andrew Blume
          Date: 19-Jul-97
          Area: "Fidonet Netmail"

     Most of you will be aware of the up-coming Zone 3 Coordinator
     (Z3C) election.

     We now have to elect a new Z3C and there are several good
     candidates standing for election.

     I have nominated Alwyn Smith as a candidate for the post of Z3C.
     The Nomination was seconded and after some persuasion, Alwyn
     accepted the nomination.

     Alwyn is steeped in the formation of Fidonet and is uniquely
     suitable for taking Z3 Fidonet through its "maturing pains".

     He is reliable and experienced at all levels of Fidonet
     Coordination having held NC, RC, and ZC posts in the past.

     He knows and expects the responsibilities and burdens of the
     position of the Z3C position.

     There are other candidates with excellent credentials but Alwyn
     Smith is the *only* candidate who has the necessary knowledge,
     experience and qualifications to get the job done.

     His track-record speaks for itself.

     Alwyn isn't afraid to face problems and deal with them correctly
     and properly.

     Decisions that *need* to be made *will* be made and not avoided,
     shelved or made hastily in error.

     Alwyn currently runs =all= the Z3 Zonegates. This is a measure
     of his acceptance of net responsibility and of his service to
     Fidonet.

     He is also involved with other networks and has a wealth of
     knowledge, experience and time to co-ordinate Zone 3 fairly and
     equally.

     It is my thought that we need a few `new ideas'.  Yet these
     FIDONEWS 14-30               Page 7                   28 Jul 1997


     ideas should be well considered and applied so they are fairer
     and more consistent than what we have had in the past.

     Fidonet's great strength is in its `warmth' and `closeness'
     which is sadly lacking in other mediums - notably the Internet.

     Fidonet has moved away from that warmth and closeness over the
     years, not deliberately, but it has changed in this direction,
     and its doing so has lessened Fidonet's attraction.

     We need to attract more people and more importantly, keep the
     people we have.

     We need the unique attraction of a `social net' again so that,
     in Dave Hatch's words ...

         "Trust is the coin of the realm" and "Please is the order of
     the day".

     Without these two very important principles, Fidonet will
     continue to wither.

     We have little else to attract people and little to keep what
     people we have, if we keep heading in this direction.

     Running around in ever decreasing circles shouting "what to do?"
     over and over demonstrably will not work.

     Neither will `knee-jerk reactionism' or `more of the same - make
     more rules'.

     It just plain and simple does not work.
     The evidence is too overwhelming to overlook yet again.

     Therefore :

     I ask that you carefully consider who you vote for in the Z3C
     election which commences on the 21st July and ends on the 27th
     July.  We need someone we can rely on now more than ever before.

     David Nugent has done a great job however he has decided to
     stand down as Z3C after closing his BBS a few weeks ago.
     I thank David for his voluntary services to both Z3, and to
     Fidonet. Well done.

     Send your vote by NETMAIL to Jackson Harding at 3:800/857
     between the 21st and the 27th July with your preferred
     candidates name and a password in the form of.......

       BBS Registry for South Australia, only 12 months ago.
       I feel that with this knowledge I would be able to do the job of
       Zone 3 Co-Ordinator to the best of my ability, to which I would try
       to improve the harmony with in Fido.

     I'll keep it short and simple.  FidoNet Z3 needs healing, after the
     last war.  (and war is the only way to describe what happened)  I know
     I appear to have strong biases, and though this may be the case, I
     will do my best to distance myself from any decisions I have to make
     as part of my ZC duties.  First and foremost will be a resolution to
     the dramas in RG54 - I will review the situation as soon as possible,
     and deal with it according to policy.  I *will* accept some argument
     over my interpretation of policy, and take different action if I feel
     the arguments are justified.

     I do *not* intend to be a dictator - if things are working, I will
     leave everyone to their business.  If I receive a request to look into
     a situation, I will do my best to resolve it.  One of the best
     strengths I can bring to the position is the fact that I can admit
     when I feel I am WRONG, and change my actions accordingly.

     If anyone has any questions, just netmail me back.

         Policy Statement:

       I have been a Fido SysGoddess for over Seven years, I have been
       running a BBS in one form or another for 11 years, I have been a NC
       in fairly large OtherNet, I have been a ZC in another network,
       though I admit my technical knowledge is not as vast as most of the
       other candidates, I feel that the job of Z3C is something a LOT more
       than just looking after the Nodelist. Fido is in a state of flux,
       and to turn this around there needs to be a new direction, and part
       of this new direction needs to be a Zone3 specific Policy Document,
       which while not usurping P4 in anyway, will help contribute to a new
       positive attitude in Z3.  Even though I cannot change human nature,
       and there will always be those people who want to do nothing but
       carp and criticise, and or pull Fido down, I hope there will always
       be people in the other direction, like myself.

     Policy Statement:

     I have been in FidoNet for almost eleven years - since it first came
     to Australia, in fact.  The REAL CONNECTION, as we were known then,
     was the first node under John Blackett-Smith.  I have also
     participated in quite a few OtherNets in an administrative capacity,
     the main one being PODNet, of which I have been the Australian Co-
     ordinator for several years, bringing the mail to the southern states
     via Queensland, using TransX and an InterNet tunnel.

     While I may not be a technical guru, I know enough to do my job not
     only efficiently, but well.  I have been in FidoNet long enough to see
     that what's coming is irreversible - we have to change, and move with
     the times.  I predict that quite soon there will be a major split
     within FidoNet with each Zone going its own way, and private
     arrangements being made between either ZCs or major mail movers for
     mail exchange, each Zone having a Policy best suited to its own needs.
     Policy at the moment is a farce - it can't be changed or amended
     because there is no IC.  There has not been an IC for many years, and
     it's very unlikely that we'll get one within the foreseeable future.

     Ladies and gentlemen, we are on our own.  We need to break away and
     formulate our own Policy, keeping the parts of current Policy that are
     relevant, and discarding those that are no longer viable in Australian
     FidoNet today.  As Zone Co-ordinator, I would liase with both
     Australian Regional Co-ordinators and the other Zone Co-ordinators, by
     voice if necessary, to bring about the much needed changes and

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     I have seen the other policy statements by the other candidates some
     short, some lengthy and detailed but policy is already set in P4 I see
     it as the duty of the Z3C to handle anything that comes the ZCs way in
     the interests of fairness to all concerned. An open minded approach is
     required and is what I would be aiming for if selected.

     On occasion I have voiced my opinions on issues from a Sysop view and
     been very much on both sides of the incoming fire. In the position of
     Z3C I believe it is a must to be able to disseminate from ones own
     personal view and concentrate on the good of the whole when handling
     issues wearing a ZC hat.

     I do not believe I should go on here like a political speech and
     promise that I'll kiss babies and give out lolly pops. All I can say
     is I would have an open mind to changes, problems and solutions.

     We are here to go forward, not back and so concentrating on the past
     seems useless although it can give guidance on circumstances to avoid.

     Let's just keep the whole thing going or risk being swallowed by
     Internet. We can sort out anything else on the fly.

     To all the candidates, good luck and thanks for being interested
     enough to put yourselves on the line to support Fido.

     David Hales

           FIDONET IS A RIGHT - ECHOMAIL IS A PRIVILEGE

     This document is intended to give the voter an idea as to where I
     stand on a number of issues affecting us all in fidonet in Zone 3.

     These views are my personal views HOWEVER I strongly believe in the
     democratic process (with all it's faults) and therefor, if elected, I
     FIDONEWS 14-30               Page 13                  28 Jul 1997


     will uphold the current Policy 4 together with our Zone 3 Conventions
     until those policies and conventions are properly changed by way of
     either referendum or a real expression of support from the majority of
     active nodes.

     I am willing to debate these issues with anyone in this echo however
     to re-iterate, they are my views and cannot be implemented without
     your full support in due course.

     FIDONET AND ECHOMAIL

     For many years I have seen echomail to be an effective way of
     canvassing ideas, seeking help, learning about various subjects and at
     times, having a good chat in the less formal echoes. This has been one
     of my greatest uses of fidonet and one my BBS users have enjoyed as
     well.

     Ever since day one however, I have had to ask around to get access to
     some echoes, been ignored by some echomail providers, been abused from
     some echomail providers, simply had my echomail feed cut for no
     apparent reason and been moved from one echomail provider to the next.
     I have seen some echomail providers use the service they provide to
     bully people into accepting situations they would not otherwise accept
     because those people thought they had to get their feed from so-and-
     so.

     I have NEVER seen a message in any echo where anyone has asked or been
     asked to help out with the supply of echomail. It has always appeared
     to have been a "closed shop", particularly at Region level. Only the
     old timers and therefor technically superior nodes were entrusted with
     echomail feeds. No new blood has been openly encouraged.

     I have seen nodes threaten to "pull the plug" if they didn't get their
     own way and many nodes keep quiet because they were afraid of losing
     their echomail feed.

     When some of these echomail providers have also been given the trust
     of fidonet nodes to manage the nodelist, they have abused this trust
     by threatening nodes with excommunication if they didn't stick by the
     rules of some echomail providers and moderators.

     I believe it's time for a change.

     Simply put, I want the *C structure to divorce themselves from
     echomail control and return to what I believe is fidonet's *C
     structure's basic purpose. That is, to manage the nodelist and make
     sure the use of that nodelist is not being abused.

     I also believe echomail has a strong future. Apart from speed of
     delivery issues (and this is rapidly changing), echomail has several
     advantages over newsgroups.

     ZONE 3 POLICY

     In line with the above comments, it is time for us to formalise a Zone
     3 Policy document to support current Policy 4.
     FIDONEWS 14-30               Page 14                  28 Jul 1997


     The policy should concentrate on management of the nodelist and
     specifically exclude echomail from netmail as far as definitions in P4
     is concerned.  I believe this will put the onus on echomail standards
     back on to whom it belongs ie the moderators of the echoes or those
     that chose to read it and/or make it available to others.

     BBS sysops can chose what they want to do with their systems. If they
     carry echoes that deal with things others don't like then that's none
     of fidonet's business. Certainly, they should not be threatened with
     loss of their node number for expressing their own beliefs. Similarly
     however, they cannot expect to demand the provision of an echo from
     someone that refuses to carry it.

     Unfortunately, there will be times when a node should be
     excommunicated from the nodelist. I can think of a few rare occasions
     eg:-

     1. Sending mail bombs that cost other people money to send.
     2. Repeated use of routed netmail solely for monetary reward.
     3. If found guilty by an appropriate Legal Court of an offence
        affecting the use of the nodelist.

     We need a draft to work from - and plenty of open discussion on the
     issue.

     I will make it my primary aim to draft a Zone 3 Policy document and
     encourage the widest input and support possible.

     *C STRUCTURE AND ELECTIONS

     I believe the current method of chosing *C's is outdated. I believe
     the nodes should elect the NC, the NC's the RC and all nodes the ZC.

     A *C should reflect the beliefs of the majority of their nodes, not
     their own personal views.

     A *C MUST be active and quickly respond to requests for help and
     assistance. The *C will be the active moderator of the Net, Region or
     Zone administrative echo as appropriate.

     A *C can be removed by the RC or ZC but must call for a fresh election
     immediately.  The majority of the nodes in a net can call for a new NC
     election whenever they like.

     2 years is the maximum term between elections of any *C.

     ZONE 3 ECHOMAIL POLICY

     I believe the above document should be established however it should
     leave the onus of management of an echo to it's moderator or users. It
     will have no direct impact on the management of fidonet and certainly
     no impact on whether a node is listed or not.

     I believe a "map" of the echomail structure (detailing the route of
     echomail in the Zone) would be of immense help to all nodes wishing to
     obtain details of available echoes and where they can get them at the
     FIDONEWS 14-30               Page 15                  28 Jul 1997


     most economical cost.

     We need to break down our reliance on the excellent work of just a few
     nodes if for no other reason than redundancy purposes. There seems to
     be a lot of duplication of effort going to waste.

     Frankly, I believe this task to be almost as important as a Zone 3
     Policy document however time to manage both as well as the
     implementation of those policies would be too demanding of one person.
     For that reason, I would ask our current excellent (if only defacto)
     ZEC if she would be willing to take on the task.

     QUALIFICATIONS

     I have been in fidonet since around 1986. I started of with Opus and
     Binkley and moved to FD and RA a year or two later for their ease of
     use.  In about 1990, I was asked to become the shareware registration
     site for FrontDoor in Australia. To help offset my costs in running my
     BBS, I also sold Commercial Editions of FrontDoor and RemoteAccess. I
     never made a living from either, my main source of income was as a
     Senior Manager with ANZ Bank in their Credit Department.

     I've held NC, RC, ZC and IC positions in SIGnet, a small International
     network with a similar administration structure to Fidonet. I believe
     my experience with nodelist admin, resolution of disputes, revision of
     policy and assisting new *Cs in that network stands me in good stead
     for the Fidonet Z3C position.

     I have been a hub in net 713 and made many mistakes. I believe I have
     learned from those mistakes and more importantly, enjoyed the
     camaraderie that belonging to an active net can bring.

     In 1995 I obtained a 24 hour connection to the internet and have tried
     many differing programs to provide internet access to my BBS users.
     Some of these have been disasters and some of them I have taken on the
     commercial sale of here in Australia. At present I am a modest ISP
     providing full services including uucp feeds. There are five BBS's
     using my services for uucp feeds (both dial-in and remote) as well as
     about six nodes that hub of me for their echomail feed. I import many
     echoes direct from the USA and Europe (nothing to do with their star
     setup nor Pearces ftp system) and provide them free to dial-in nodes
     and free to my ISP customers.

     I have recently been retrenched from the ANZ and now devote much of my
     time to the BBS and internet interests.

     In summary, I have the technical experience, time and wherewithal to
     undertake the duties of the Z3C.

     FTSC

     I have little knowledge of the workings of the FTSC but I believe it
     to be the essential and authoritative source of what constitutes FTSC
     compatible networks.  The internet has RFC's - we have the FTSC.

     The FTSC has no political standing (or at least should not have).
     FIDONEWS 14-30               Page 16                  28 Jul 1997


     I believe it needs to be reconstituted and be seen to be effectively
     working.

     It is not simply a Zone 3 issue however and will require someone to
     become actively involved in its use.

     I bow to greater and more experienced minds in this respect.

     MY COMMERCIAL INTERESTS

     Over the years, many of you have come to realise that I am keenly
     involved in FTSC compatible networks, both fidonet, SIGnet and
     commercial applications.

     I openly admit to being an ISP, sell FrontDoor, TransX and any other
     good BBS related software I can get my hands on. I would like to make
     a living from my hobby - who wouldn't :-) .

     I also strongly believe in supporting the shareware concept and will
     try to foster other people to do the same.

     Notwithstanding my own commercial and personal beliefs, I certainly
     refuse to allow myself to use my hobby to impinge on others beliefs or
     standards.  If elected Z3C I will encourage everyone to respect the
     shareware concept and register what they use. I will not however abuse
     the *C structure to force adherence to my or anybody else's personal
     beliefs. In fact, I will actively pursue anybody that attempts to do
     so as there is no place in the *C structure for such persons.

     SUMMARY

     I think you will now understand my motto -

     FIDONET IS A RIGHT, ECHOMAIL IS A PRIVILEGE

     With very few restrictions, everyone has a right to be listed in the
     nodelist. To get an echomail feed you have to respect other peoples
     rights and freely given time and services as well as agree to abide by
     the moderators requests and judgements. You, as the BBS sysop, also
     have a right to do with your own system as you like - but you need to
     respect the views and rights of others.

     we have learnt from our past collective experiences.

     -----------------
     by David Meikle (2:259/27.4 , rebeljambo@geocities.com)

     Hi, I have one bit of news this week that the Fidonet in Europe
     homepage is now up and running at
     http://www.geocities.com/siliconvalley/way/8351/ . You can eMAIL me at
     rebeljambo@geocities.com . If you are going to connect to the page
     please wait until Saturday at 7pm (GMT).

     I offered to fix a laptop for a friend a T3100e and all I need is a
     systems disk for that type of machine. If anyone has one could they
     please contact me. Thank you in advance.

     A response to Steve Woodmore's InetTM flags
     by Lee kindness, 2:259/7, wangi@earthling.net

     A response to the proposal posted by Steve Woodmore titled:

        "Internet as a transport mechanism for fidonet
                 A proposal for Nodelist flags"

      SW> by Steve Woodmore, 2:440/410 (2:2/200 ZEC/2)
                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

     Pointless flag waving by the power-hungry Z2EC, Steve what relevance
     has that to a technical specification? You are 2:440/410, nothing
     more, nothing less. Anyway, let's move away from this pointless hohee
     and onto something more constructive...

      SW> 1: FTP (File Transfer protocols)
      SW> 2: Email attaches MIMES/UUencodes (this also assumes tunneling
      SW>    programs)
      SW> 3: Virtual Modems

     4: BinkP, direct mailer usage over IP - differs from VModem.

      SW> M  - This Node is able to transfer mail either by UUencoded
      [ snip ]
      SW>      A node must dial-up their ISP to collect/send fidonet
      SW>      mail at least Once daily to qualify for this flag

     As with everything else in fidonet we should not force any node to
     do anything.

      SW> The Internet is here to stay, we in fidonet can no
      SW> longer hide our heads in the sand and hope it goes
      SW> away.  The flags indicate that we are using the
      SW> nodelist as an alternative transport mechanism, and
      SW> we are in no way becoming a part of the Internet.

     The flags would show a node has the ability to use the internet
     (via a number of methods) to transfer mail. However they do not
     give any information with regards of how to deliver that mail,
     say an email address for email transfer, an IP address for the other
     methods. Without this information these flags really just boil down
     being status symbols, with no real use. An additional nodelist
     kept somewhere on the 'net with this information rather than
     phonenumbers might be desirable - one exists already for BinkP users

     The real solution is to update the nodelist format itself to allow
     for multiple (pnone)lines and transport mechanisms behind one node
     entry. For example consider:

     ; [ snip ]
     ,7,Kooosliam,Lee_Kindness,Edinburgh,PSTN,44-1314-425563,MO,V34b,Tuh
     FIDONEWS 14-30               Page 20                  28 Jul 1997


     Extra,EMAIL,wangi@earthling.net,MIME
     Extra,PSTN,44-1314-425564,CM
     Extra,ISDN,44-1314-425565,CM,MO
     Extra,BINKP,kooosliam.co.uk,CM
     Extra,VMODEM,kooosliam.co.uk,CM
     Extra,FTP,ftp.kooosliam.co.uk,Tuh
     ; [ snip ]

     as a nodelist entry for 2:259/7 in a new format nodelist (most
     entries are mythical). It basically describes a 'super-system' with 2
     normal phone lines, an ISDN line, and VModem, ftp, BinkP connectivity.

     In general the nodelist entry format would be (where "" denotes a
     literal, <> a term that will be substituted, ()* a sequence that can
     be repeated multiple times and \n a return/linefeed):

     <type>,<node>,<sysop>,<loc>,<protocol>,<address>(,<flag>)*\n
     ("Extra",<protocol>,<address>(,<flag>)*\n)*

     type:     A la the current nodelist format, Zone, Region, Host, Hub,
               blank for node and Point (extension).
     node:     The fidonet address part.
     sysop:    Name of the system operator.
     loc:      Physical location of system.
     protocol: Protocol or type of connection, ie PSTN, ISDN, FTP, EMAIL,
               VMODEM, BINKP and whatever else.
     address:  The connection address, datatype is protocol specific, for
               example with PSTN it's be the phone number, email the email
               address, VModem the IP or host address...
     flag:     Flags for supplying additional information, with a common
               subset and protocol specific flags.

     Such a nodelist could be brought into use with relative ease as the
     new format can easily be converted from the 'Edinburgh' format <grin>
     to the 'St Louis' format: (a sample awk script that does the dirty)

     ######### nlconv.awk ############################################
     BEGIN {
             NF = ","
     }
     # a base node line
     (NF >= 6) && ($1 != "Extra") {
             # is the first entry PSTN?
             if( $5 == "PSTN" ) {
                     # print out old format nodelist line
                     printf("%s,%s,%s,%s,%s,9600", $1, $2, $3, $4, $6)

     C and BASIC versions for any platform would be as simple.

     This is an idea that has been playing around in my head for a while,
     nothing above is concrete and more than likely it needs a lot of
     playing around with before it's anything approaching an FSC document
     that could be adopted by Fidonet. I'll post this article into NET_DEV
     for further comments.

     To: webheads@softdisk.com
     Subject: a man named Jed
     Sender: owner-webheads@softdisk.com
     Reply-To: webheads@softdisk.com

     Come and listen to a story 'bout a man named Jed,
     A poor college kid, barely kept his family fed,
     But then one day he was talking to a recruiter,
     Who said, "they pay big bucks if ya work on a computer..."

     Windows, that is... PCs... Workstations...

     Well, the first thing ya know ol' Jed's an Engineer.
     The kinfolk said "Jed, move away from here".
     They said "California is the place ya oughta be",
     So he bought some donuts and he moved to Silicon Valley...

     Intel, that is... Pentium ... big amusement park...

     On his first day at work, they stuck him in a cube.
     Fed him more donuts and sat him at a tube.
     They said "your project's late, but we know just what to do.
     Instead of 40 hours, we'll work you 52!"

     OT, that is... unpaid... mandatory...

     The weeks rolled by and things were looking bad.
     Schedules started slipping and some managers were mad.
     They called another meeting and decided on a fix.
     The answer was simple... "We'll work him sixty-six!"

     Tired, that is... stressed out... no social life...

     Months turned to years and his hair was turning gray.
     Jed worked very hard while his life slipped away.
     Waiting to retire when he turned 64,
     Instead he got a call and escorted out the door.

     Laid off, that is... de-briefed... unemployed...

     Now the moral of the story is listen to what you're told,
     Companies will use you and discard you when you're old.
     So gather up your friends and start your own firm,
     Beat the competition, watch the bosses squirm.

     Millionaires, that is... Bill Gates... Steve Jobs...

     Y'all come back now... ya hear'
