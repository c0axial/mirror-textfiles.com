Times they are achangin'
by Tom Jennings, Editor (1:1/1)

As you may have noticed, Vince Perriello has stepped down from
editorship of FidoNews. Tim Pozar & I have taken over as editors on
pretty short notice. We are about to make some substantial changes we
feel have been necessary for a long time. Some have already been
implemented.

The editorial policy was and still is "we publish anything". But what
that meant was, on any subject. This is an unusual editorial policy,
but one that I felt was important to the net back in 84 when this all
started, and I think it is still important.

In the intervening years, there were two major directions it could
have gone; the "well we can't have *THAT* in there ..." "and *THAT*
wasn't what was meant by..." which is the usual route. Then there's
the way it *did* go -- the harder route of an open policy. It is to
the great credit of all of the editors that they decided what they
did.

The phrase for the problem (which I just discovered a while back) is
the "slippery slope". Once you start down it, there is no way to turn
back and no way to tell when to stop.

To make it crystal clear -- the "rule" that would keep out
"controversial" christian articles would be the same "rule" that
would prevent homo-anarchist articles (for instance :-) -- and
eventually anything else not lowest-common-denominator.

FidoNews is *not* an L.C.D. trade rag. It has no pretense towards an
Industry newsletter. It is by and for FidoNet sysops, users and other
people we consider "members", and I can tell you plain that FidoNet
is not a monolith, the diversity is incredible and only our institu-
tional policies prevents this from being clearer.

FidoNews, like FidoNet, was an experiment, and I believe we can all be
proud of it's success -- for all the flaming, ill will and trouble we
go through, we have one of the most reliable, resilient and *fiercely
independent* organizations on the planet. I wouldn't have it any other
way! It is not supposed to be easy -- convenience is not a good goal.

So the policy remains in effect with one change -- there is a minimal
writing standard, for clarity, not content -- that articles must meet,
to ensure that they are intelligible to someone other than its author.

The article-submission guidelines file, ARTSPEC.DOC, has been revamped,
and is included in this issue of FidoNews as an article. The various
"departments" of FidoNews will also be changed. "Column" type articles
are no more; you must submit each one separately. Notices, sale items
and want-ads will be converted into a more general "classifieds"
section in the near future.
FidoNews 8-22                  Page 2                       3 Jun 1991


The format for FidoNews will change further. The current format is one
of those things I did in 1984 that is today very puzzling -- an
electronic newsletter designed to be copied to a printing device! It
is nearly impossible to read online. It is wasteful of space, on both
disk and printer. The left margin alone (now gone) accounted for 10%
of its size. The tentative goal is to keep FidoNews under 100K bytes
in size.

We will be actively soliciting articles from people with interesting
perspectives in FidoNet and the world beyond on issues and problems
that face us as a network in the real world. Though we are
accommodating access to/from other networks such as the Internet and
uucp, FidoNews will remain 100% a FidoNet newsletter.

Some time later this year, the format of FidoNews will be plain text
without pagebreaks, long dash lines and formfeed characters. End-of-
section markers will be ASCII characters. It will then be readable
online. All computer systems today have a way to "pretty print" ASCII
text files, so that is no longer a valid reason.

Sorry for the terse editorial, we're under a severe time limit to
learn the software, file conventions and to get an issue out on time.
By next week things will be under more control, and we can get down to
the business at hand -- communicating, instead of talking about the
communications device!

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I guess you noticed that there are new names for the "Editors" on the
Masthead. One you may recognize as the "papa" of this mess, Tom
Jennings. Well, I'm the other name. My name may be associated with
another mess, the linking of FidoNet to a network called UUCP and a
conferencing system called USENET. (*)

Which brings up the point of this essay. FidoNet users and sysops, for
the most part, are not aware that there are other networks out there.
We tend to be a bit ethnocentric in our views of the networking world.
With the advent of gateways into other networks from RBBS-NET to non-
fidonet based technologies like UUCP, USENET, and the Internet, we
need to be more aware of other customs and technologies. (For example,
not everyone can display the IBM-PC character set, or perhaps we
should look at the method of our network addressing so it is easier to
send and receive mail from these other networks. We'll look at these
things in later issues.)

To this end, we hope to include more articles that are not only
related to FidoNet, but to networking and communications as a whole.
This is not to say that FidoNews will loose it's FidoNet flavor, we
just want to give the readership an idea on what else is out there,
and include what Sysops and Users may have some interest in.

For instance, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Inc.(EFF) is working
to educate folks (lawyers, law enforcement, policy makers, sysops,
hackers, and crackers) about the hysteria and misinformation that our
government and law enforcement agencies seem to be going through and
trying to spread about electronic communications. Our basic civil
rights are being affected due to the ignorance of these agencies. The
EFF is also supporting many of those affected by paying or helping
with legal costs.

On other subjects, how many know of the resources that are available
via the Internet? There are a number of "News" services that can add
value to your BBS. There are archives that will easily shadow the
biggest FidoNet archive sites.

We just can't hide our head in the sand with all of the potential that
FidoNet can be, and the threats to FidoNet from the ill informed.

Buenos Aires, June 1 1991


                   ZONE-4 ELECTION RESULTS

Hi once again. This week, you will not hear me complain about
anything. To the contrary, a few nice things have happened this
week and among them there are two I would like to highlight.

1. The return to the limelight of the founder of FidoNet, Tom
Jennings. I, as well as all the sysops in my zone I was in touch
with since the news arrived here, are very happy about it. I
thank Vince Perriello for his work on FidoNews and for his
continuous support and respect of freedom of expression.

2. My resignation as Zone-4 Coordinator is effective with the
upcoming NODEDIFF and the new ZC has been named today. Here is
all the information on the election that ended yesterday:

The Zone-4 democratic election of the new Zone Coordinator has
ended yesterday. The three candidates to the position were
Alejandro Hopkins from Temperley (Province of Buenos Aires,
Argentina), Clovis Lacerda from Recife (State of Pernambuco,
Brazil), and Gustavo Zacarias from Palermo (Federal Capital,
Argentina).

The election was done on a one-sysop-one-vote basis, having ALL
of the sysops in the Zone the right to vote. The most encouraging
ingredient of the election that has very much impressed me was
the formidable level of participation: slightly over 80 percent
of the Zone's sysops exercised with commendable responsibility
their RIGHT to vote.

The complete vote-by-vote results were published on the
LATIN.SYSOP echomail conference. Here are the totals:

Alejandro Hopkins received    1.59 percent of the votes
Clovis Lacerda received      39.68 percent of the votes
Gustavo Zacarias received    58.73 percent of the votes

Therefore and according to the sysops' wishes, I proclaim Gustavo
Zacarias the new Zone Coordinator for FidoNet in Latin America
effective with the upcoming nodelist update. My thanks to all of
the candidates and best wishes to the new ZC.

It was for me a superb experience to pilot the Latin American
zone during its first stage since foundation, and I would like to
thank all of my zone's sysops for their continued support during
the whole term.

FidoNews 8-22                  Page 5                       3 Jun 1991


I hope that the upcoming years as a "grunt" sysop will be even
more fun than the challenging stage now ending, and I will
continue contributing to the goal of bringing the whole of Latin
America online in FidoNet.

New FidoNews article submission guidelines

[The following are the new guidelines for writing articles for
FidoNews. I believe this still meets the original intent
of "we publish everything". It is however substantially shorter
and covers more basic ground, and I think reflects the FidoNet
network of 1991.

It is a tribute to the original author that the overall document
remains more or less intact, and most specifics are unchanged.
Wording was changed for clarity and terseness, and the format
changed to pure ASCII without printer-page formatting to
accommodate the environment of today -- when it was originally
written the network was nearly 100% IBM clones.

                                        -- Tom Jennings ]


FidoNews Article Submission Guidelines
FidoNet address 1:1/1
Updated 29 May 1991 by Tom Jennings
Based on the original work by Thom Henderson

--------
SYNOPSIS:

FidoNews is the newsletter of the FidoNet computer network, its
sysops and users. It is passed to its readers electronically via
the FidoNet and other computer networks and to non-network
readers as well.

This document intends to tell you how to write and submit
articles for publication in FidoNews. Much of it describes the
technical specifications which an article must meet in order to
be included in the newsletter, as well as broad (very) guidelines
on content. (Of course you realize articles can be submitted only
electronically.) Please read it carefully. The article you save
might be your own.

------------
INTRODUCTION:

FidoNews was originally founded in early 1984 to include all
parts of the lives of its member sysops and users, which of
course means not just technical matters. We do not have fixed
goals of maximum distribution or maximum readership (ie. lowest
common denominator) but only to meet the needs of our individual
network members. The success of this venture has always been
contentious at best (ahem).

In any case the grand experiment continues. Seven years later (at
this writing) and nearly six doublings in size of the network,
the editorial policy, or lack of one, of FidoNews has shown to
best fit our ever-changing and unpredictable needs.


--------------
SUBJECT MATTER:

Articles on any subject of interest to FidoNet members and users
are welcome and encouraged, not necessarily of a technical
nature, though priority may be, but not necessarily, given to
articles of importance to the FidoNet, its technology and its
uses; other networks such as uucp and the Internet; social
aspects of communications; ethical issues; other related matters.


--------------
ARTICLE LENGTH:

Try to keep articles short. The longer it is, the less likely
people are to read it. Consider splitting long articles (more
than five pages) into smaller articles to be run serially.
Exceptions will be made at the whim of the editors.

For practical reasons, we will attempt to keep FidoNews to a
"reasonable size", which is of course a highly subjective and
variable thing. As of May 1991, the goal is under 100,000 bytes.
Decisions regarding content may be made based upon this, though
in general it shouldn't be an issue.


------------------
WRITING GUIDELINES:

We are not all professional writers, nor is that even a goal for
the FidoNews -- we want real communication to and from real
people; even at the expense of so-called "good writing", which is
frequently a tool to exclude. There are a few minimum
requirements though for any successful writing, even for the
lowly FidoNews:

FidoNews 8-22                  Page 7                       3 Jun 1991


* The subject discussed must clear to people other than the
  author! Don't assume that people will pickup the context from
  your writing. Tell them explicitly.

* Why are you writing this? It may seem obvious -- "Review of the
  new Acme 75-baud Modem" -- but it's not. Are you the
  manufacturer? An irate customer? Let us know your point of
  view.

* Who are you? A good question! Anonymity is acceptable, though
  most people want to take credit for their work. Include full
  contact information including electronic mail addresses.

* Articles will appear when space becomes available, not
  necessarily the "next" issue. If your article is of a time-
  critical nature, please say so when you submit it; the editor
  still has final say.

* The editor reserves the right to request changes from an author
  to meet these "standards", which you have to admit are pretty
  loose. It is not the intent for this to be a mechanism to
  refuse articles the editor does not like, but simply to keep
  the contents intelligible.

* If we have a backlog of articles, we may get fussier about
  things. Historically this has not been a serious problem.


---------------------
SUBMITTING AN ARTICLE

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

If all that hasn't scared you away, the next step is to create a
text file which contains the text of your article. The resulting
file should be sent or uploaded to "FidoNews", FidoNet address
1:1/1. The "physical" location (and phone number) of FidoNews
varies, and hence must be found elsewhere, such as within a
recent copy of FidoNews itself.


Filenames must follow the MSDOS standard:

    FILENAME.TYP

    an 1 to 8 character file name (A - Z, 0 - 9)
    a period,
    a 0 to 3 character file type (A - Z, 0 - 9)


File types are used to distinguish types of submissions, as
follows:

FidoNews 8-22                  Page 8                       3 Jun 1991


    .ART An article, commentary, open letter, or general news
         item.
    .AD  "For Sale", "Wanted" or other advertisement.
    .NOT A notice for the back of the issue.

If your file doesn't have one of the above extensions, then it
will lay around taking up disk space until someone takes a look
at it and realizes what it is. Maybe.

The name of the file is up to you, though you should use a name
which is not likely to be "stepped on" by someone else -- the
system will not guarantee file names are unique. For example,
FNEWS.ART is probably not a good name for an article.


--------------
CHARACTER SETS:

The character by character contents of the file itself must meet
the following standards or it cannot be published in FidoNews.
The FidoNews staff will not be responsible for making file
contents conform to these standards.

* FLUSH LEFT MARGIN: Please do not put a "left margin" on your
  articles. Have the text start at the very first column.

* RIGHT MARGIN AT COLUMN 72 OR LESS: Less is tolerable, more is
  definitely not.

* RAGGED-RIGHT TEXT: Word-Star style "justification" (inserting
  spaces into sentences so that a paragraph is perfectly rec-
  tangular) is extremely hard to read, and consumes needless space.
  Please don't use it!

* NO FUNNY CHARACTERS: This includes formfeeds, returns without
  linefeeds, linefeeds without returns, tabs and other oddities.
  The only control codes (character codes 0 through 31 decimal)
  allowed are carriage return (CR) and linefeed (LF). The only
  exception is: Control-Z "end of file" terminator characters are
  tolerated. Not required.

* NO GRAPHICS CHARACTERS: Believe it or not, not everyone in the
  world has an IBM PC. Please restrict yourself to printable
  ASCII characters in the range 20 hex to 7E hex (space to
  tilde).

* LINES TERMINATED: Each line in the article should be terminated
  with a 'newline' -- either the MSDOS standard (CR/LF) or the
  unix standard (LF only).

-----------------
SUBMISSION FORMAT:

Below is a sample article properly formatted. Features of it are
discussed further below.





* A Sample Article

by Joe Schmoe
This Is My Title

And here is my article. Note that it is flush left (zero indent).
Also note that the right margin is at column seventy so that it
won't overflow "most" text windows. Each line has a newline. Note
the *'ed first line. My article will be listed in the table of
contents.

Figure 1.                       Table 1.
        +-------+               ========
        | A Box |                  Alfa
        +-------+                 Bravo

Note that we am not using any funny-o characters. This ensures
that the final article will look the same to every user, no
matter what sort of hardware he has.

This is the last sentence of our article.





The first line of text is the Table of Contents line. It must
begin with an asterisk * as shown above. If you do not, the
article will not be listed in the table of contents.

* Everything that follows the *'ed line will appear in the body
  of the newsletter.

* Next should be the title or name of your article, your name,
  and contact information (network address(es), Postal Service
  address, etc) Try to keep it to one or two lines each.

* Put a blank line between paragraphs. Paragraphs that all run
  together are very difficult to read, and may be rejected.

* If you want to put in a table or a figure, go right ahead.
FidoNews 8-22                  Page 10                      3 Jun 1991


  We do not rearrange text, so your table or figure will
  remain exactly as you entered it. Try to limit them to ones
  that make the communication CLEARER.

* Don't put a lot of blank space at the top or bottom. The
  FidoNews-generator programs will visually separate articles
  automatically.

* Please check for basic errors in spelling, grammar, and
  punctuation. We're not publishing a textbook, but you don't
  want it to embarrass yourself do you?

WorldPol 2: Why???

Everyone knows that WorldPol was defeated: soundly. Me, I am glad
because I voted against it. I voted such because it places undue
politics into an already political organization. Granted, I didn't
"STUDY" WP as some of you have, but I did read enough to know that I
didn't like it. I stopped reading in the section about how a Net is
defined and the NC "voted" upon.

1) Policy 4 is adequate and right in its definition of how a Net is
formed: geographical. The whole section is geared totally around the
sysop and against the NC. The sysop can be part of any net he desires,
but the NC MUST take all comers within 10 days. I can hardly find
anything more political than that. If the sysop doesn't like the NC, he
goes elsewhere, to spite the NC. You also promote "My net is better
than your net" with defections, people trying to "win" other nodes.
Policy 4 DOES work. By making a geographical boundary mandatory you
remove all politics and that's the why it should be. I can't imagine
why anyone would want more.

2) Why should sysops have the right to vote on an NC? I am a Net
Coordinator. Why? Because I'm stable. Not because I made friends,
promises, or comments about the previous NC, but because I will be here
next week and next year. I am fair and I am apolitical. I removed my
NEC (a close friend) and his node when he refused to abide by Echopol
and restored his node when he agreed...he is still my NEC. A local
sysop that I am at total odds with is contemplating joining our
community. While we rarely see eye-to-eye, I eagerly await his node
request and will treat him with courtesy and respect. THAT is why I am
the Net Coordinator. The policies of WP would have some NC's attempting
to deny nodes to those who might vote him out, or may try to
excommunicate a sysop who is rousing the rabble. No, elections aren't
the way.

For that matter, WorldPol isn't the way. The people have spoken. LET
IT DIE! I will NEVER *EVER* vote for WorldPol in its current form or
any other form that neuters the NC. How many times must we be subjected
to a small group that will never give up on the same old work? Give me
Liberty, give me Death, but don't EVER give me WorldPol!

I'm happy to "announce" that through the efforts of a few
persistant and vociferous sysops, we've managed to convince
the makers of a new Peer-to-Peer network OS to offer a special
price on a 2-user version for BBS sysops. I have been using the
WEB Network for over 6 months to run a 2-node system, and it
is the easiest and most reliable small network I have seen.
(this from someone who supports Novell for a large company)

The following is the text of their "press release" describing
the sysop deal, and details on getting the full info file.
If you'ld like more info, or an online look-see at a working
system, feel free to contact me on Wolf's Moon BBS and I will
arrange a time with you to do a remote drop-to-dos session and
see the whole thing in action. I have also negotiated some good
deals on ARCNET network cards to use with the WEB system, which
will get you up and running for under $250 total; and the
results a quite well worth it.
