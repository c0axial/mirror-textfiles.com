     There isn't a lot in this issue...outside my window, it's raining
     during a storm that wasn't supposed to be here until this coming
     Wednesday.  Another El Nino artifact, I presume, modified by the
     arrival this early morning of a Harrier jump jet for a series of
     training exercises at the local National Guard air base.

     For those of you who have never experienced a Harrier landing, be
     prepared to dive for cover, as the noise generated is not unlike a
     large airliner crashing into your living room...for about five
     minutes.

     One thing came to mind this visit, however...how is this plane to
     "quietly" attack its targets?  Or does it's strike speed make up for
     it's lack of 'stealth'?

     There's a message in there...just think it over a bit.

     As things go, Zone 2 seems to have modified its "position", in that
     Ward Dossche is no longer making noises of separating Zone 2 from the
     rest of FidoNet...but then, he still doesn't want to allow any sort
     of dissenting opinion to be posted along with his own messages.

     To that end, a new echo called ZCC-DISCUSSIONS looks like it is being
     formed to route around Ward's censorship.  You might inquire about
     the availability of the echo if you are interested in Zone and
     International matters.

     And, for the last time, I ask if anyone out there has a compiler for
     Lattice C code, or a "translation" scheme to move the Lattice C code
     to something a bit more 'useful' or 'relevant' to modern C or C++
     compiles...please contact me at one of the addresses below.

     Dear Editorbeing,

     This article is submitted by Doc Logger (1:163/110,
     cherriot@magmacom.com) whose bleary eyes were caused by
     creating new Map projections to satisfy the geographic
     anomalies in Net163.

     Roll da flic, Zorch....

     Dear Reverend Visage,

     The editors of Swamp Swine Magazine were a tadge concerned
     about the recent photo essay you submitted. They said that
     Sports Illustrated had already done the swimsuit issue theme
     and they could hardly discern which audience would be
     intrigued by scantily clad penguins. Did you send the right
     box of slides?

     Not much has happened on the Western Front this week other
     than the fact that Bob "Noted" Satti used up a mere 37 words
     of his quota last week so we can look forward to perhaps as
     much as 54 stunning words of wisdom from him next week. I
     posted the survey results in the usual elflord echos where
     it served as a useful spacer between the avalanche of
     Tannacore trophalactic effluvia and the Tom Cole Charm
     School lessons. To his credit, Jerry Schwartz took the time
     to question the validity of the survey but didn't quite
     bring himself to say whether he disbelieved the results.

     The elves in Net163's Sherwood Forest have added a node from
     Edmonton and a node from Rhode Island to their merry band.
     Needless to say, our lil' buddy Dallas Hinton has fired off
     the usual pre-policy complaint inquiries. Hint for Blondes:
     Yo Dallas, if NCs in your net weren't so busy threatening to
     excise sysops from the nodelist, perhaps they'd be happier
     to stay on as labourers in your Gulag. What is even more
     amusing about this latest exchange of grapeshot is that,
     after reading Bob "noted" Satti's last policy appeal
     decision wherein Satti whinged about not being asked for a
     geographic exemption; the NC-babe of net163 humoured him
     with a request. Bob "Noted" Satti sat on his prehensile
     thumbs and didn't deign to answer the request.

     The much maligned Bob Kohl emerged from his bunker long
     enough to post a series of incomprehensible responses to his
     multitude of detractors. Of course, once his head was up
     above the foxhole, he took it in the shorts again for having
     violated the privacy of routed netmail. The RECs have
     resolved not to call for Kohl's removal as the Z1EC, but
     instead to ignore him in the hopes that he finds amusements
     FIDONEWS 15-18               Page 3                    4 May 1998


     more suited to his talents - like sanding wooden blocks, for
     example.

     Our prayers and our edible underwear should go out to the
     multitude that is Zorch. Apparently one of his detractors
     has alleged that more than one vote was cast by one warm
     body in the Z1EC election. Zorch has stated that he has
     enjoyed the suppositions which either indicates that his
     detractors are sucking pipe, or else Zorch is suffering from
     a radish deficiency. Maurice Kimal, who would have made a
     great Young Republican when Nixon was clinging to his last
     venal months of power, has chastised Zorch's detractors for
     their "witch hunt tactics." His Zorchness recommended
     reading Ayn Rand's naive capitalist anthem "Atlas Shrugged"
     which I found amusing. Perhaps he would be delighted to know
     that the modern era Hank Reardons are 22 year old
     derivatives traders at Morgan Stanley who can pole-axe
     national monetary policy with just a few, ill chosen trades.

     For this week's Chautauqua I would like to include a pithy
     quote from Wayne C. Booth's "Is There Any Knowledge That a
     Man Must Have?" The issue arose  in a personal way when I
     noted that neither of my teenmonsters who are attending high
     school have had to write a single essay in school this year.
     My first and obvious conclusion was that they were being
     adequately trained to become the next generation of echomail
     participants where standards of literacy are no asset. In
     the case of my teenmonsters, what concerns me about the lack
     of essays was the more important issue of what sort of
     critical abilities can they hope to achieve if they are
     never compelled to use them. Anyway, here's Booth's
     commentary:

     "The man who has not learned anything about how to
     understand his own intentions and to make them effective in
     the world, who has not, through experience and books,
     learned something about what is possible and what
     impossible, what desirable and what undesirable, will be
     enslaved by the political and social intentions of other
     men, benign or malign."

     Booth doesn't say it, but I also wonder if there is a more
     prevalent ideology which suggests that the first preference
     of people is *not* to have their feet held to the flames of
     knowledge. Ignorance and irresponsibility are bedfellows.
     >From experience I surmise that one of the cruelest torments
     you can inflict on those who refuse to be educated is the
     insistence that they be responsible. This is the fly in the
     ointment of democracy because assuming an informed
     electorate is fallacious. This truth is used by disparate
     groups on the political spectrum. From the Dallas Hintons
     who assert the sysops are too dumb to choose their own
     masters, to the anarchists who assert that the only valid
     compact is one between individuals. I favour the latter
     reasoning but also recognize that between the choices of
     totalism and democracy, the latter is the lessor evil.

     I must go Visage. I have promised to give a Theremin concert
     for a roving pack of whales in Rivierre Du Loup this
     evening. One has to take audiences wherever they can be
     found, as you well know. I hope your secretary appreciated
     the truckload of radishes that I thoughtfully had delivered
     to her room.
