        Editor:    Tom Jennings
        Publisher: Fido #1


                            HOT NEWS


                Oh boy ... the hot news this week is that Fido #1
        dropped dead. The hard disk is in the junk pile. Any
        articles that were submitted for this weeks newsletter are
        lost forever. Please send them again, I'll see if I cant
        hold on to them.

                Fido is running on two floppies, no room for
        anything. Until further notice, Fido cannot be downloaded
        from #1. I have a solution though; I'm getting an ancient
        old multibuss machine,three 8 inch floppies, at least 660K
        each, for a total of 1.98 megs. If I can get double sided
        drives, that might go up to almost 3 megs. It will take a
        week or two, though.

                More good news: the Sanyo 555 version of Fido is
        ready. The bad news is, you can't have it! I have no space
        to store it ... There will also be a "generic" version of
        Fido, so that you can write your own IO drivers. It will use
        INT 14, which you can trap and do things with. 

                Bumper stickers are going to be made tomorrow; they
        should be done who knows when, because of Christmas.
        Possibly before. I'm going to sell them at cost, merely to
        recover my own money. They will cost about $165 for 500;
        about 34 cents each. I'll mail them in onesies for a buck
        each (postage .20, envelope .25, etc) or if you buy 25,
        $10.00. I'll let you know when they are done.

                I will also mail you a copy of the master if you
        ask, so you can make them too.

                     ARTICLE SUBMISSION

                The format of this thing is totally ad hoc; please
        make recomendations as to formats, sections needed, liked,
        or hated, columns you'd like to see, or see removed,
        anything at all. If you want to submit something regularly,
        we can start a column for you.

                You are ENCOURAGED to send things in for the
        newsletter. ANYTHING is fit for the newsletter, such as a
        description of your board, problems found, questions, jokes,
        fixes, horror stories about wrong FidoNet numbers, things
        for sale, etc etc etc. 

                   SUBMITTING AN ARTICLE

                An article should have your name, node number (if
        applicable), followed by the text. Text can be any ASCII
        derivative; WordStar, soft paragraphs, 8th bit set, etc are
        all OK.

                Articles can be uploaded at either Fido #1 or #51,
        into the NEWS File Area, or by sending it by FidoNet. There
        is a convention for naming the files, so that the newsletter
        can be published automatically.

                       ARTICLE FILENAMES

                file.ART        For article type things

                Make sure the name is unique, especially if you send
        it by FidoNet, so you dont overwrite another article.


                      HOW THIS IS PUBLISHED

                This is a totally electronic newsletter; articles
        are written of course by users and sysops, but all other
        parts and proceedures are machine generated.

                For each newsletter, the Editor (thats me folks)
        does the date and volume of the title page (tough job), and
        whatever editorial there may be.

                Articles are checked out for being readable (ie.
        more or less English language), and bum copies (bad uploads,
        etc) are deleted. 

                The lists generated by FidoNet Admin (St. Louis)

        such as the node list, Fido list, and the route list, come
        in via FidoNet during the week.

                On the day the newsletter is to be published, Fido
        #1 runs the text formatter (as a schedule) to produce the
        newsletter, using all the articles, the node and Fido lists.
        The completed newsletter is then copied into the NEWS file
        area. All of the article submissions are saved as last
        week's news, and deleted to make room for next weeks.

                Some canned messages are copied into Fido 1's mail
        area, which file attaches the newsletter to the distribution
        points. This completes the FidoNews Newsletter publication.
                TOM TCIMPDIS' LA BUST

                The LA BBS bust is far from over. There hasn't been
        any news lately, apparently because they are going through
        the usual legal maneuvering, of hearings, pre-hearings, etc
        etc.

                However it turns out, this is an important case, and
        whether you believe it or not, it will affect you directly,
        even if you are not in LA and even if you are not a sysop.

                Tom's guilt or innocence is only a small part of the
        importance of this, and since most of us were not regular
        callers to his board, it is hard to comment on it.

                The underlying issue here is one of control: who is
        liable for the contents of a BBS? It was related to me (by
        someone who had lawyers persue it) that the status of BBS's
        is quite up in the air; are they common carriers (ie. the
        phone co.) or are they publishers (ie. newspapers). Phone
        companies have limited liability because they provide a
        medium, and not the contents, and are generally not liable.
        (If you arrange a sale for a stolen bicycle by phone,
        Pacific Bell is not resonsible). Publishers control their
        contents, and I think are liable for even the contents of
        their classified ads, though that is obviously impossible to
        ensure.

                You really should voice your opinion on this issue.
        It will not mark you as a political radical, and the FBI
        will not harrass your neighbors. It is your right, and our
        right to free communications.

                Losing this case will be a large step towards
        regulating BBSs. Regulation will mean the death of BBSs as
        we know it. We are unregulated, and are quite responsible
        and take care of our own problems. The trouble makers are
        far and few between. 

                Take the time to think about all of the systems you
        have ever called and patronized, and consider how they were
        run, how they were handled and how problems were solved. I
        think you will find that they take quite good care of
        themselves on the whole, and problems are resolved between

        the users and the sysops.

                If you want to help keep it this way, where you have
        a very large say in what BBSs do, what they are used for,
        and how they are run, please write!

        Dear Sir,
           
                I would like to take this oppurtunity to speak in
        behalf of computer bulletin board sytems (BBSes).  Bulletin
        Boards are excellent ways to meet other computer users and
        hold intelligent conversations with them.  Bulletin boards
        are a very convenient way to get any help you might need for
        your computer, from advice on a game to programming
        techniques and technical information.   
           
                The idea that all of these bulletin boards are used
        solely for pirating of software and illegal telephone usage
        is one that is ill-conceived, stemming from the occasional
        "bad seed" of BBSes.  In reality, these illegal BBSes are
        few and far between, and are frowned upon by the general
        BBS-using public. 
           
            I urge you to consider all the good of which BBSes are
        capable, and not the bad side shown by several rare and
        unacceptable examples. 
           
            Thank you in advance for your consideration in this
        matter. 




                                   Sincerely, 

                        (print and sign your name here)
