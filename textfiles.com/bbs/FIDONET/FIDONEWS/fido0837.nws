                              EDITORIAL
======================================================================


Regarding last week's suggestion of changing FidoNews article submission
policy (see below): a bunch of yea's, and one nay, included in an
article this issue. If there are no reasonable objections (and I put
emphasis on "reason") I'll put it into effect by October 1991. And for
the nay: articles not meeting the criteria of ARTSPEC.DOC may be
included, at the editors discretion, so off-subject but potentially
interesting articles will not be lost.

                                * * * * *

I received this week a rather lengthy article from Jack Decker (1:154/8)
regarding Steve Winter's religosity in previous FidoNews', in which he
calls Steve on his allegedly very narrow and legalistic viewpoint.

Jack wrote this article and attempted to submit it to FidoNews months
ago, but due to software bugs in a mailer that refused to handle FidoNet
messages (not echomail) over a certain length it did not get delivered
to me until this week.

I asked him to withdraw the article, for a number of reasons; Jack
acknowledged that in the spirit of the anticipated change in FidoNews
policy, that it would be sufficient if I mention it and tell you where
you can obtain his article. (At FidoNet 1:154/8)

And truly, Thanks Jack, for helping out. This was a special case because
of the non-delivery. I now consider the case closed, and outside the
FidoNews context.

                        * * * * *

CHANGES TO FIDONEWS SUBMISSION POLICY:

The idea is to change the FidoNews article submission policy, as
writtedn in ARTSPEC.DOC, to require that articles be in some way to what
the amateur FidoNet network is about.

For your reference, here is the original paragraph in ARTSPEC.DOC that I
propose changing:

        --------------
        SUBJECT MATTER:

        Articles on any subject of interest to FidoNet members
        and users are welcome and encouraged, not necessarily
        of a technical nature, though priority may be, but
        not necessarily, given to articles of importance to the
FidoNews 8-37                  Page 2                      16 Sep 1991


        FidoNet, its technology and its uses; other networks such
        as uucp and the Internet; social aspects of communications;
        ethical issues; other related matters.


I propose to change this paragraph to something like this:

        --------------
        SUBJECT MATTER:

        Articles must be in some way related to the FidoNet,
        its technology and its uses; other networks (such as uucp
        and the Internet); social, ethical or legal aspects of
        the above; and other related matters. You are welcome
        to submit articles on other subjects, but their inclusion
        is at the discretion of the editor(s).

CLASSIFIED ADS:

Additionally, there was a proposal to remove the CLASSIFIED AD section
of FidoNews. The reason given was simply that the interests of sellers
are better served on BBSs or in Echo conferences. I agree, and unless
someone can come up with an elegant argument in favor of keeping it,
I'll drop it also.

I might as well go so far as to propose that we drop the .NOT "Notices"
section. It's poorly understood anyways, and could simply be replaced
with a very small article. Such things exist today; I could argue either
way whether Echo Conference announcements are notices or articles.

This would mean that submissions to FidoNews would be anything with a
filename extension of ".ART". (Keep your wisecracks to yourself.)
Simple, no?

1.0  Purpose of this Document
=============================

The Zone One Backbone Echomail System consists of the Zone Echomail
Hubs (commonly referred to as "Stars"), Region Echomail Hubs and Net
Echomail Hubs who help to distribute the Zone One Backbone echomail
conferences.  This system is hereafter referred to simply as the
Backbone.

An echomail conference is a message base or forum, distributed under a
specified echomail conference name, dealing with a defined area of
interest.  Echomail conferences are hereafter referred to simply as
conferences.

Echomail Hubs are nodes who distribute echomail.  The Echomail Hubs
are hereafter referred to simply as Hubs.  Zone Hubs distribute
echomail at the zone level.  Region Hubs distribute echomail at the
region level.  Net Hubs distribute echomail at the net level.

This document sets forth the operating procedures used by the Backbone
at the zone level.  It describes how the Zone Hubs, and those Region
Hubs who connect directly to them, operate.  The operation of the
Backbone within a region or net is not covered by this document.

If any item in this document is in conflict with any existing or
subsequent General Fidonet Policy, then General Fidonet Policy will be
in effect.



2.0  Zone Echomail Coordinator
==============================

The Zone Echomail Coordinator (ZEC) oversees the operation of the
Backbone at the zone level.  The ZEC coordinates routing and schedules
to ensure reliable and efficient availability of Backbone echomail
while avoiding creation of duplicate messages.  The current ZEC can be
identified from the 1/200 listing in the Nodelist.

FidoNews 8-37                  Page 5                      16 Sep 1991


2.1  Zone Echolist Coordinator
------------------------------

The ZEC is responsible for maintaining a list of Backbone conferences
(Echolist).  To assist in this effort, the ZEC appoints the Zone
Echolist Coordinator.  The current Zone Echolist Coordinator can be
identified from the 1/201 listing in the Nodelist.

The Zone Echolist Coordinator compiles and publishes the Echolist
monthly.  It is distributed through the Software Distribution System
(SDS) in the ECHOLIST area.

The content and format of the Echolist are at the discretion of the
Zone Echolist Coordinator, except that it includes the conference's
name, the Moderator's name, a netmail address listed in a publicly
available nodelist of any network where the Moderator can be reached,
a general description of the conference topic, any eligibility
requirements for restricted conferences, and the network of origin for
conferences which originate outside of Fidonet.

The ZEC personally maintains a text file called FIDONET.NA.  This is a
list of the Backbone conferences in such a format that it can be used
as a forward-list by programs such as AreaFix.  The ZEC distributes
this list to the Zone Hubs whenever it changes.


2.2  Zone Hubs
--------------

The ZEC appoints Zone Hubs (Stars) to distribute Backbone echomail at
the zone level.  The ZEC may also serve as a Zone Hub if [s]he so
desires.

The ZEC makes available a minimum of one connection from each of the
Zone Hubs to each region.  A region may choose to not use all of the
connections available to it.

Each Zone Hub carries all of the Backbone conferences.  Each also
distribute the FIDONET.NA file, as received from the ZEC, to the
Region Hubs they connect with.

The ZEC and Zone Hubs maintain an emergency backup plan should one of
the Zone Hubs experience problems.

Nothing in this provision requires that a ZEC or Zone Hub must import
any conference to the extent of adverse economic impact.



3.0  Region Echomail Coordinators
=================================

FidoNews 8-37                  Page 6                      16 Sep 1991


The Region Echomail Coordinator (REC) oversees the operation of the
Backbone at the region level.  The REC coordinates routing and
schedules to ensure reliable and efficient availability of Backbone
echomail while avoiding creation of duplicate messages.  The current
RECs can be identified from the 1/2xx (where "xx" = the region number)
listings in the Nodelist.


3.1  Region Hubs
----------------

The REC appoints Region Hubs to distribute Backbone echomail at the
region level.  The REC may also serve as a Region Hub if [s]he so
desires.

The REC decides which Region Hub connects to each of the Zone Hubs.
If a REC feels that [s]he needs more than one connection to each of
the Zone Hubs, [s]he may request extra connections from the ZEC.

Region Hubs do not necessarily carry all of the Backbone conferences,
but all of the Backbone conferences are available through them.  They
also distribute the FIDONET.NA file, as received from the Zone Hubs,
to those they connect with.

Nothing in this provision requires that a REC or Region Hub must
import any conference to the extent of adverse economic impact.



4.0  Backbone Conference Moderators
===================================

Backbone Conference Moderators (Moderators) preside over conferences.
The Backbone has no desire to interfere with the internal affairs of a
conference in so much as they do not disturb the operation of the
Backbone.

A Moderator need not be either a Sysop or a member of Fidonet.  If the
Moderator is not a member of Fidonet, [s]he must list an address in a
publicly available Nodelist of any network, so that he can be
contacted if the need arises.


4.1  Duties of Moderators
-------------------------

Moderators are responsible for:

    1)  Seeing that messages in their conference correspond to
        the conference's theme.

FidoNews 8-37                  Page 7                      16 Sep 1991


    2)  Updating their conference listing in Echolist at least
        every six months.

If a Moderator believes that a node is violating a conference rule,
[s]he may authorize the feed to that node be severed.  This
authorization is made in direct written form (netmail), to the Hub
feeding the offending node, with a copy to the offending node.


4.2  Recognition of Moderators
------------------------------

A Moderator is recognized as follows:

    1)  Upon formation of a conference, the person who forms the
        conference is the Moderator.

    2)  Upon resignation or replacement of an existing Moderator,
        the conference's rules define how the new Moderator is
        selected.

    3)  Should a conference which originates inside of FidoNet be
        without a moderator for over 30 days, the ZEC may cause a
        Moderator to be selected.

Moderators are encouraged to appoint Co-Moderators to assist them in
their duties and to stand in for them in their absence.



5.0  Operating Procedures
=========================


5.1  Echomail Message Standards
-------------------------------

FTSC specifications FTS-0001 and FTS-0004 are followed.  All Backbone
nodes use the pathline option.


5.2  Banned Messages
--------------------

The Backbone does not distribute any conference which routinely
contains messages which are encrypted, contain illegal information or
promote illegal activities.  As used in this paragraph, "illegal
activities" includes activities which are a violation of civil law as
well as activities which would result in criminal prosecution.

The Backbone does not distribute any conference which routinely
contains counterfeit messages.  A counterfeit message is any message
entered using another person's name, handle or node address with the
intent of deceiving others about the true author of the message.

FidoNews 8-37                  Page 8                      16 Sep 1991


5.3  Censorship
---------------

It is not allowed to delete a message from a conference, or alter its
contents, in the passing or distribution of Backbone echomail.

Exceptions to this provision are the deletion of messages, by any
node, which may lead to legal action against that node or which do not
meet the echomail message standards in Section 5.1.


5.4  Adding Conferences to the Backbone
---------------------------------------

The ZEC adds a conference to the Backbone when all of these
requirements are met:

    1)  The conference is listed in the Echolist.

    2)  The moderator sends a netmail request to the ZEC.  [S]he
        should include a copy of the Echolist confirmation
        message if the conference does not appear in the
        currently published Echolist.

    3)  Two RECs request that the Backbone carry the conference
        to their regions.


5.5  Removing Conferences from the Backbone
-------------------------------------------

The ZEC may drop a conference from the Backbone when any of these
situations occur:

    1)  The conference is not listed in the Echolist.

    2)  The moderator sends a netmail request to the ZEC.  The
        ZEC always honors this request.

    3)  There are no longer two RECs requesting that the Backbone
        carry the conference to their regions.

    4)  The Moderator fails to properly carry out his duties, as
        described in Section 4.1.

    5)  The conference is without a Moderator for over 30 days.

    6)  The traffic level in the conference falls below 5
        messages over a two month period).


FidoNews 8-37                  Page 9                      16 Sep 1991


5.6  Echomail Gateways
----------------------

Echomail Gateways are nodes whose systems are used to exchange mail
with other groups.  The term Gateway, as used hereafter, includes all
forms of gating including, but not limited to, zone-gating,
inter-network gating, and domain-gating.

Gateways remove foreign distribution identifiers (including seen-bys)
which might adversely affect the distribution of the conference on the
Backbone.

Gateways also pass netmail into the other network, unless it is
technically impossible to do so.


5.7  Routed Netmail
-------------------

Backbone nodes accept routed netmail from any node who connects with
them for Backbone conferences.  Any netmail message with a valid
Fidonet destination, regardless of its origin, is accepted.  Routed
netmail may be routed along echomail paths or to a ZC, RC, or NC who
has agreed to handle such mail.



6.0  Changes to this Document
=============================

A change to this document may be proposed by any REC.  Anyone else
desiring to propose a change should find a REC who is willing to
sponsor their proposal.

If a second REC concurs with a proposal, the proposed change is voted
on by all of the RECs.  Notice of such a vote is posted both in the
REC conference and in FidoNews, at least 14 days prior to the start of
the voting period.  The RECs are expected to assess the opinions of
the members of their regions, and to vote accordingly.

The voting period is 7 days.  More than 50 percent of those voting
must vote for a change for it to be accepted.


                            - end -

======================================================================
                               ARTICLES
======================================================================

Was FidoCon '91 Too Commercial?
 from Chris Anderson, 1:104/114

In 835, your editor noted that some had misgivings about the
somewhat "commercial" nature of FidoCon '91.  In particular, he
noted that there were complaints about the "vendor exhibit area"
that we set up.

For those complainers (and our supporters) who have never
actually set up a convention of the size of FidoCon '91, you
should be aware of the costs involved and how we succeeded in
arriving at *your* cost for the convention.

There are two major competing approaches to funding television
stations in this country.  One is the commercial approach, and
the second is the "PBS approach" where a larger portion of the
cost of programming is borne directly by the users of the medium.
The former costs you only if you determine that you want to buy
the products of the advertisers.  The latter is voluntary.  Both
work.

Had we taken the 2nd approach to FidoCon '91, and had not
solicited funds from vendors to rent booth space, funds would not
have been available for other things we did without raising the
rates directly to you for the convention.  We didn't want to get
involved in high room rates or high convention rates.  By asking
our vendors to kick in funds we accomplished what we wanted.  We
also provided them a reasonably professional looking area for
the display and sales of their various products.  Each vendor
present had something to offer to our hobby, and each came to us
at some substantial expense to their organization.  That's the
way most things are sold in this country.  I'll tell you this:
I found products at the show that *I* was unaware existed, and
I was the one who made a lot of the initial contact with our
vendors!  As a result, I purchased a couple of items that have
served me well.  Word-of-mouth is not always sufficient;  even
word-of-keyboard hasn't served in this case!

Had we taken the 2nd approach to FidoCon '91, we would not have
been in the position to offer air fare to some of the folks you
had a chance to hear (it sometimes comes to that, folks), nor
would we have been able to provide rooms for these same folks and
some of our out-of-town volunteer staff members.  We believed
that their contributions were worth the cost to bring them to
Denver, and not all of them were willing to come for free.

This stuff *ain't* free.  Although it's become evident that there
are a certain few of the "old timers" that would just as soon
find a spot and sit and schmooze for a weekend, it's also become
evident that there are a lot MORE folks who are interested in
the range of speakers and products we were able to present.  We
had two choices - charge a good bit more than we did for
FidoNews 8-37                  Page 11                     16 Sep 1991


conference memberships, or do it the way we did.  To make the
event economically accessable to the greatest number of people,
we chose a somewhat "commercial" approach.  The alternative
would be (gag) fund drives? here in FidoNews like the PBS boys
do it.  Might work.  I doubt it.  It was hard enough to find
volunteers for some of the many jobs that had to be done in order
to make FidoCon '91 happen, much less go out soliciting cash from
folks who could, collectively, probably pay the national debt each
year from our combined phone bills and hard drive purchases.

Again, the objective was to help defray costs in order to lower
membership rates for attendees and yet cover the costs of putting
on the event including expenses for some of our speakers.  If
you appreciated having these folks present to provide you with
their insights on our hobby, remember how this was accomplished.

Be advised that there is an attempt afoot to provide what may prove
to be an even more commercial (for profit) event here in Denver for
1992.  Although IBECC (the folks who brought you FidoCon '91) has
currently has no relationship to this "other" convention, we're not
sure that this has been made clear enough.  A joint effort would be
possible ONLY in the event that the promise were made that the
event would be held as a not-for-profit event, and that rates would
be kept as low as possible for attendees as a result.  As yet, we
do not believe this to be the case, since both of the sponsors of
this other potential convention are for-profit organizations.

IBECC's 1992 convention (and we are hoping it is every bit as much
a FidoCon as 1991, although bids have not even yet been *solicited*
by ZC1!) will continue to operate as a not-for-profit organization.
The necessities of planning what they are, work had to be begun for
1992 with or without FidoCon status.  Without it, we would obviously
have to shift our emphasis somewhat.  Fact is, it isn't possible to
wait until who-knows-when to begin working towards next year.  There
are, for example, no other hotels that have space available in
August of 1992 in our area.  Other cities may discover the same sort
of problem.  Waiting longer isn't practical.

Next year's event will center around "Socially Responsible Computing".
We intend to include a major segment on telecomputing by the
handicapped, and you can expect that we will have vendors with products
such as readers for the blind (text-to-speech) making an appearance.
Yes, it will remain somewhat commercial in this sense.  We believe
that the benefits derived from this approach outweigh any negativism
expressed by a certain minority of the "old-timers".  I don't
believe we have any apologies to make for our approach, and we hope
the RC's understand this.

This medium has not remained static in any sense over the few
years of its existence.  Our audience is far wider than it was
in the beginning.  Our approach to bringing information to our
members is growing with the number and diversity of the folks
who are interested in it.  Those who rue this change are either
going to have to adjust to our new size or start anew.  We're
not just a few technophiles anymore.

BTW - we talked to George Peace about the importance of soliciting
bids for future FidoCons well in advance.  It is important to use
the momentum from each FidoCon and the collected experience of each
years' staffs to help each successive convention be a success.
We hope that future convention sites/dates/emphases can be
determined a least a month prior to the opening of each year's
convention.  This would make life FAR easier on the coordinators of
following year's events.

FidoCon '91 has come and gone, and we've not yet seen a solitication
for next year's hosts to come forward.  C'mon George.  Whoever gets
it for 1993 needs a break.  Please plan to firm up the site for 1993
at least a month before FidoCon '92 begins!

P.S. We'd like to thank Tony Davis, our new ZEC, for attending this
     year.  He was the only RC (heck, he isn't even an RC anymore!)
     who made an appearance.  You guys voted for Denver - and we
     missed you!

                           29 August 1991

Thank You!

Much as we would like to be able to write a personal, handwritten,
thank you to each and every person and organization who attended or
supported the IBECC / FidoCon '91 conference, it is simply
impossible.


For those who are interested in statistics, we had over 400
attendees from around the world, booked over 180 hotel rooms on
Friday and Saturday nights, had 199 people at the banquet (one more
than the maximum seating available -- somehow), gave out four major
awards, and distributed over $10,000.00 in prizes.

There were almost three full days of multi-track sessions, more than
forty (40!) hours of videotape recorded, at least 1500 pastries
served in the VIP Hospitality Suite, and countless cups of coffee,
soft drinks, and tea dispensed.

As enclosed news releases indicate, we're not stopping and standing
on our laurels - we've taken the next step.


IBECC, and the 1992 International BBSing and Electronic
Communications Conference, is now a non-profit, charitable, society.


Members of IBECC will receive discounts on video (and audio) tapes,
have access to the IBECC BBS, receive the IBECC Newsletter and
conference progress reports, and more!  In addition, members of the
1991 IBECC/FidoCon conference will receive the membership prices on
tapes if ordered before January, 1992.


But (and you knew there was a "but"), to continue the efforts, we
need your continued support - in the form of membership in IBECC.
Supporting membership, which includes discounts on tapes and a
subscription to the IBECC newsletter, is $25.00 a year!

VIP Membership (includes Supporting membership and the 1992 IBECC
Conference) is only $80.00 (US) through September 30, 1991 ($125.00
October, 1991 through May, 1992).  Vendor's tables are $500.00 (US)
[including two VIP Memberships], and "booths" [including three VIP
memberships] are $1,000.00 (US) through September, 1991.

Now is the time to join!  EVERYONE is noticing us!  [Don't believe
it? Check out the September 1991 special issue of Scientific
American "Communications, Computers and Networks - How to Work, Play
and Thrive in Cyberspace" - and compare it against the who, what and
why of the 1991 convention...]

IBECC '92 will be held August 13 - 16, 1992 at the Sheraton Denver
West Hotel and Conference Center, 360 Union Blvd, Lakewood, CO
80228.

The theme of IBECC '92 is "Socially Responsible Computing", and will
include panels on such diverse topics as: "Why Should I Care?" [How
does all of this affect me?], "Safe Computing" [What do we need to
know to prevent the spread of computer infection?], "Rumor Control
1992" [Knowing the difference between fact and fiction and When to
take action], "Why Kelly CAN Read" [Exploring Computers, BBSing, and
Education], and "Staying Alive" [BBSing and the physically
challenged and homebound].

We are not neglecting our roots either; there will be function space
and sessions for all participating networks. This is a time for
unity and communication - we are working to continue the
affiliations begun at this year's conference as well as to
strengthen them over the course of the next year.


The hotel room rate is $62.00 (US + tax) single/double.  Please,
reserve early by contacting the Sheraton directly at 1-800-LAKEWOOD,
or (303) 987-2000.  Suites and Hospitality Suites are available
through IBECC.

Tickets for the International (theme) Awards Banquet are $35.00 (US,
all taxes and gratuities included).  T-Shirts (all sizes) are $15.00
(US, all taxes included).

We accept VISA, MasterCard, American Express, Cash, Checks, Money
Orders, and even payments.  We support the Handicapped/Challenged -
Please contact IBECC for details and special rates.

IBECC is a Colorado Nonprofit Corporation; IRS 501(c)(3) and
501(c)(6) pending.

                       For Immediate Release

The founders of IBECC, a Colorado non-profit educational,
scientific, literary and charitable society, presented their thanks
to eSoft, Inc. for its support and assistance before and during the
recent International BBSing and Electronic Communications Conference
held in Denver, Colorado.

The plaque, presented at the eSoft corporate offices in Aurora,
Colorado says: "In appreciation of eSoft, Inc. for assistance in the
formation of an annual International BBSing and Electronic
Communications Conference and the IBECC Educational, Scientific and
Trade Society."

Phil Becker, President and CEO of eSoft, was also presented with an
Honorary Lifetime Membership in IBECC for his personal support of
the international BBSing community.

Also due to be presented with a similar award and honor is
Boardwatch Magazine and its founder Jack Rickard.

"We feel that both eSoft and Boardwatch assisted in making this
year's conference the largest of its kind ever to be held," stated
Michelle Weisblat of IBECC.  "It is our hope that they will continue
to be active supporters in the future."

Electronic Communications Conference (to be held August 13-16, 1992
in Denver, Colorado), contact IBECC at P.O. Box 486, Louisville,

IBECC, a Non-Profit BBS Support Organization, is formed

                          August 23, 1991
                       For Immediate Release

Based on the success of the 1991 International BBSing and Electronic
Communications Conference, (held in Denver, Colorado, August 15-18)
the organizers are continuing their efforts by forming a non-profit
corporation called IBECC.

FidoNews 8-37                  Page 18                     16 Sep 1991


Created as an educational, scientific, literary and charitable
society, the goals of IBECC include "promotion of national and
international electronic communications, education in and
improvement of online services, the scientific advancement of
telecommunications and teleconferencing, scientific improvement of
communications between different electronic networks, and providing
a trade association for users and suppliers of teleconferencing
networks and systems."

"IBECC represents the culmination of a dream," stated Michelle
Weisblat, one of the founders.  "A year ago, most of those who
supported the conference said that it was a visionary concept but it
would never happen, couldn't be done, and would result in financial
disaster.  Six months ago, these same people began to truly believe
that it might just happen.  One week ago, it did happen - people
from Europe to Australia gathered here in Denver to prove that not
only could it be done, but that there was a real need to continue
and expand upon it!"

"We decided that a non-profit organization would be the best way to
carry the concept forward," continued Marshall Barry.  "So many
visions have been devastated by the motive of personal or corporate
profits.  By taking this route, IBECC is much more than just another
yearly 'trade show' - it becomes a people's clearing house for ideas
and information, available to anyone, anywhere."

"We expect to continue to get support from some of the more
visionary companies," added Terry Travis, the third of the founders.
"This kind of organization benefits them as well.  It provides a
showcase for new products, new concepts, and new directions without
the usual media 'hype', getting directly to those who really use the
networks and the facilities."

"As the price of computing continues to decrease, and the cost of
communications drops, more people world-wide are involved in
telecommuting, BBSing, and electronic mail daily.  The boundaries
between countries are disappearing...  we must keep these new lines
of communication open, refine them, and make them secure."

"What we are seeing is the development of the printing press, books,
and the mail system all over again - on a global scale. If we hide
from it, or ignore it, it will run right over us, leaving behind
confusion and chaos... or, we can encourage it, guide it, educate
ourselves and others, and use the technology," concluded Marshall.

The founders of IBECC, who are all handicapped, are extensively
involved in computer networks and electronic communications, and run
several electronic Bulletin Board Systems (BBSes).

IBECC is also filing for federal non-profit and tax-exempt status
under IRS 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(6) rules.

IBECC, FidoCon, and the 1992 IBECC Conference
by Marshall Barry, IBECC
1:104/169
mbarry@isis.cs.du.edu
Voice: 303-426-1847, Fax: 303-429-0449
US Mail: P.O. Box 486, Louisville, CO  80027-0486

I read Jack Rickard's announcement of HIS BBS conference. I did
find it interesting, amusing, and even informative if not a bit
apocryphal.

Being one of those responsible for IBECC and FidoCon '91, I felt
that there were just a few small points which needed to be made
before we all went on our separate ways.

First, to prevent confusion - The 1992 IBECC International BBSing
and Electronic Communications Conference _IS_ going to be held
August 13-16, 1992, as previously announced, advertised, and
described at this year's FidoCon. The conference theme will be
"Socially Responsible Computing."

It is, alas, unfortunate that Jack Rickard (and Phil Becker) have
decided to run a competing convention on those same dates, but,
hey, what they're doing is not what we're doing.  I do wish
(LARGE GRIN) that we had known their intentions (date wise)
BEFORE we awarded them their plaques for helping us to start
IBECC, but...

Second, our hotel (the Sheraton Denver West) has committed ALL
function space, rooms, and services to the IBECC conference.
This means that we have room and membership rates locked down now
- No guess-work, no wondering, no vapor.

Hotel rates are $62/night single/double.  Membership is $80 "VIP"
(through the end of September), and we still have a $9.69
Significant Other Membership.

By the way, IBECC has been incorporated as a Colorado non-profit,
educational, scientific, literary and charitable society [we're
applying for IRS 501(c)(3) status as well].

We are a membership organization - which means we will be working
all year to gather news, distribute information, and help
maintain the credibility of the community, as well as to promote
international communication.

FidoNews 8-37                  Page 20                     16 Sep 1991


I suppose that means that we're not in it for the money (we've
re-invested the "profits" back into the 1992 conference), or to
make it a "BBS industry and networking trade show ... and a
relatively big one".

There IS room for more than (smile) "one bbscon".

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Eric Gustafson
Fido 1:152/27

    Well, I've read Fidonews for awhile now, and have seen
several articles that either irritated, annoyed, or just plain
enraged me. Usually, I start to fire off a nasty response.
Then, the simple "Thou shalt not become overly annoyed" pops
into my mind, and I shut up, power down, and let the flames
discharge.

    Fidonews 836, however, depressed the heck out of me.
I think that I've found the emotional trigger that kicks me
into author mode. Why?

     2 things, actually.  First off, seeing Tom, I mean, TOM
JENNINGS do a sudden about-face.  Especially on an issue which,
up until now, I've completely agreed with him.  Fidonews should
print everything that meets technical standards.  Elvis pics
are a bit disconcerting to find in the middle of the 'Snooze, I
admit, but they DO compress well.  And the information about
becoming a minister was interesting.  Always wanted to become
"Monsigeur Gustafson"  That's information I never would have
come across without the liberal publishing policy of
Fidonews-as-it-has-been.

Let's try and keep it Fidonews-as-it-is, not Fidonews-as-it-was.

Second (You knew, of course, that lurkers don't come out unless
they're bitching about at LEAST 2 things), seeing Jack Rickard
splintering away from IBECC '92.  There are quite a few reasons
for my generally depressed, pessimistic viewpoint here:

1)  Terry, Marshall, and Michelle did one heck of a job on the
    first try, with only minor mites.  Saying "Well, that was
    nice, but I think I'll do it better myself" seems somewhat
    premature.  Give 'em a second chance!
    (Apologies, Jack, but that's the general feeling that I got
    from your article)

2)  Saturation.  I'm somewhat curious as to what kind of a
    market there IS for BBS shows.  I'm especially worried
    about "Show Burnout."  Having two conventions, especially
FidoNews 8-37                  Page 21                     16 Sep 1991


    within a month of each other, makes me shudder.  Especially
    after a train that took 30 hours to get to Denver and 36
    back. ;)

3)  Commercialization.  I didn't find the companies that showed
    up to be at ALL offensive.  Heck, I even got a free Prodigy
    T-shirt out of it.  Toss in the Qmodem hat, and I look like
    a bloody billboard for products that 99% of the US couldn't
    care less about.  I like that.  If you're getting scared
    off because of flak over something as necessary as having
    companies that MAKE THE PRODUCTS WE (Generic Sysops, if
    such things exist) USE, then perhaps the flak-ing (flaky?)
    folks should think it over a bit.  And keep flaking, it's
    good for the mind.

4)  After arguing that things should stay the same, I'll just
    say that, whatever the differences were from previous years,
    I liked this new one.  Maybe you haven't heard that
    enough.  Us (Generic Bitchers) tend not to emphasize the
    good things, and there were a lot of good things this year.
    Let's do it again.

    As a conclusion, of sorts, I'd like to comment that I
enjoyed the heck out of myself at FidoCon '91/IBECC, and thank
everyone who gave up their time to educate and entertain me and
407 other folks.

     Incidentally, I think I heard the Microsoft joke about 7
or 8 times.  Enough is enough! ;)

(Now awaiting flames from half of FidoNet and the editor of the
best darned computer magazine out there)

Now available...The Disney Discussions Conference!
Chris Harrower, 1:270/417

DISNEY...just the mention of the name brings many happy memories.  The
first time your parents took you to see Pinocchio...that trip to
Disneyland, when you accidentally stepped on Mickey Mouse's foot, and
felt bad all day...the first time you rode the monorail through the
center of the Contemporary Resort Hotel at Walt Disney World, and saw
that beautiful scene...and many more -- Fantasia, Snow White, EPCOT
Center, even Dick Tracy and Arachnophobia...

Now, you can relive all those memories again with the Disney
Discussions conference...a place to remember the old, and keep in
touch with the new.  And cover ALL facets of the Disney empire --

THEME PARKS...it all started July 17, 1955 in an orange grove in
Anaheim, California.  A revolution that would shake the world to it's
roots, and begin a vacation empire untouched by anything before or
since.  In October, 1971, in a mosquito infested swamp outside
Kissimmee, Florida, the lock was turned, and, in the words of Time
Magazine, "as a shrine, Walt Disney World is surpassed only by Kyoto,
Mecca, and the Vatican."  13.3 million people a year visit Walt Disney
World.  Then there's Tokyo Disneyland, and the soon to open Euro
Disney Resort.  And you can learn about them all in the Disney
Discussions Conference.  We will be "on the scene" at the 20th
anniversary celebration of the Walt Disney World vacation kingdom,
reporting on what YOU can expect when you next visit.  We also will
have someone in person, reporting on the grand opening of Euro Disney,
next spring in Marne-Le-Valle, France!

MOTION PICTURES...the list is endless, and a part of everyone's
childhood (and adulthood!).  From "Steamboat Willie" through this
Christmas' release of "Beauty And The Beast", the Disney Discussions
Conference covers 'em all.  And we talk about the other studios under
the Disney umbrella...Touchstone, Hollywood Pictures...what would Walt
think?

SOFTWARE...the new Disney Software line is drawing rave reviews, and
has proven to be a very popular line.  One of the "head honchos" at
Disney Software is on-line with us, and passes on the latest
information, as well as answering your questions.

MORE...there's much more to the Disney Discussions conference...we
have "resident experts" who work at Disneyland and Walt Disney World,
who can answer those "inside" questions you always wanted to ask. We
have lifelong collectors and enthusiasts who can answer (or ask!) even
the toughest trivia question with ease!

Contact me, Chris Harrower, at 1:270/417 to join in the Disney
Discussions conference...you'll be very glad you did.

   Now it's time to say goodbye to all our company...
   ()_()    M - I - C (see you real soon)
    (_)     K - E - Y (Why? Because we love you)
            M - O - U - S - E

(NOTE:  To answer the inevitable question, I am not now, and never
have been an employee of The Walt Disney Company, or any subsidiary.
I have no "vested financial interest" in the promotion of Disney, but
have a life-long love for the work started by Walter Elias Disney, and
this is one way I can say "thank you" to him.  I started the Disney
Discussions sub on WWIVNet, and still participate there...perhaps
someday we will even look into connecting both Disney conferences!)

"4X4-Net", a new(ish) network, specializing in automotive type
subjects, with a particular interest in Trucks, 4X4's and the
activities surrounding them, is asking for volunteers, to become part
of the network.  Within the next three months, a number of
international magazines, dedicated to 4X4's, Off-Roading (and others),
will be running advertizements concerning the availability (and use)
of the "4X4-Net" network.  Many companies and organizations, who work
in the "4X4" area, wish to become involved and lend their expertise
and knowledge, to those using the network and we need people to
"carry/operate in" the network.  This is NOT an alternative to
FidoNet, or any other network, as the echoes, files, etc., it carries,
will be specific to the purpose of the network.

Requirements:

    Be willing to help (at any level), the basic operation of the
    network.  Carry the network and it's echoes, so people (users)
    have access to it.

    Help new people, using the network, who may have little, if any
    experience with computers, much less "networking".  This will mean
    helping people who are strictly "Users", to helping new systems
    become involved.

    No need to be "personally" interested in 4X4's themselves (though
    it is always nice), more importantly though, we need people who
    are interested in seeing what a network can do for a
    "non-computer" group...


For more information on becoming involved, you may freq either of the
following files (magic names):

"4X4INFO" - Information which will tell you a bit more about the
            network itself

"4X4NET"  - The complete startup file, information, nodelist, policy,
            etc...

From:

      1:11/717 (WI), 1:320/119 (CT), 1:114/59 (AZ), 1:395/3 (TX)

Thanks.
