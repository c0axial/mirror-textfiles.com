                               Ten years of P4

     This last week, on June 9, we marked our tenth year on Fidonet since
     the adoption of Policy 4.07.  Will this be the year it's changed?

     Many regions throughout the world have adopted the practice of
     electing coordinators rather than simply appointing them as
     specified in P4, the International Coordinator follows a policy of
     allowing geographic exemptions for node listing which potentially
     abrogates the strict geographic organization specified in P4,
     internet only nodes are multiplying in Fidonet, yet one of the
     obstacles to their full acceptance is the requirement to be
     available for dial-up netmail during Zone Mail Hour, spelled out in
     P4.

     It would seem that the time is ripe for change - indeed, all the
     candidates running in the current Z1C election have spoken of the
     need for this change - and yet there is no plan afoot.  Will this be
     yet another year that we talk about change, and let it slide to a
     future which may elude us?

                               Joe was right...

     ... when he pointed out a conflict of interest between editing the
     Snooze and running for election.  Only it didn't turn out the way he
     predicted.  He was concerned that I would use the seat as Editor Pro
     Tem to make an advantage in the election.  What's happened instead
     is that I refrained from writing the editorial here I would have.

     Were Henk back from vacation, and were I in the position of just
     another reader sending in articles, I'd have reprinted my thoughts
     expressed in the Z1_ELECTION echo concerning his accusations of a
     conspiracy in the SUPER-BITCH echo.  Instead, I'll refer readers to
     that echo if interested, and only make one observation on behalf of
     Fidonews:

     The accusations contained in Joe's article "Z1C Election Conspiracy"
     should be either substantiated or disavowed by the Election
     Coordinator.  These accusations and proposed actions go beyond
     simple echo moderation and have the effect of endorsement of the
     theories advanced.

                                 My Road Map
                               David Moufarrage
                                  1:2613/404

     I have been pondering about a "road map" for Fidonet for some time
     now, for more time than I have been thinking about what I could do
     as Zone 1 Coordinator.

     Much of it is just like planning a trip: Figure out where you want
     to go, then look at what route you'll be taking and what you'll need
     along the way.

     However, unless you know where you are, you won't know how to get to
     your destination.

     Trying to figure out where Fidonet is, is a collective effort, just
     like our ultimate destination. This collective effort is carried out
     in discussions we find in our echos, FidoNews, and, to some degree,
     is reflected in conversations surrounding this election.

     So, where are we?
     =================

     1. The world is changing. The shrinking nodelist is a reflection of
     that change. It says to me that Fidonet didn't adapt at the rate
     necessary to retain its following. Fidonet needs to respond to those
     changes.

     2. Fidonet has gone through a change in attitude. The "top-down"
     structure of Policy 4 is definitely no longer desired by the
     majority of nodes I see posting in echos.

     3. Fidonet is still largely a POTS network. Fido/IP is still in its
     infancy. Fidonet programs are mostly text-based and more cumbersome
     to operate than the commercial Internet software bundled with todays
     PCs.

     Where does this leave us?
     =========================

     1. Now is the time to support efforts which get our arms around
     Fido/IP and its implications. We need to assure a cohesive network,
     where POTS nodes and IP nodes can continue to communicate with each
     other. This requires the development and approval of common
     standards. Those standards are currently being developed by the
     FTSC.

     2. Taking Fidonet into the 21st century will require that we listen
     to one another. It requires the ability to bring varying opinions
     under one roof. Fidonet is still a world-wide venture. We must treat
     it that way. We must strive to stay a cohesive network that uses
     FIDONEWS 16-24               Page 3                   14 Jun 1999


     technology to better communicate and not let technology divide us.

     3. We must continue supporting our developers and try to attract new
     ones. New users can only be attracted by easy to use, GUI-type
     programs. Likewise, new nodes will look for more sophisticated bbs
     systems with features offered by programs such as WinServer, BBBS
     and EleBBS.

     Where do I come in?
     ===================

     I have been a node in Net2613 since 1994. My first interaction with
     the Fido "establishment" was in late 1994 when I was asked by some
     users and points to prevent the hijacking of an echo. I successfully
     lobbied with Mike Fuchs and Bruce Bodger, an experience that left me
     with somewhat of an unpleasant taste for policy loopholes.

     Within a few month I was elected Hub Coordinator, and later Net
     Coordinator.

     The nodes of Region 13 elected me their RC in 1997. The decision to
     run for RC was initially made because I wanted to avoid having some
     jerk stick his/her nose into every aspect of local business,
     something we were quite used to in Region 13. We were also used to a
     lot of fighting in our regional echos, something that has almost
     completely stopped. We still discuss and disagree, but the climate
     is generally friendly and non-abrasive. It is very much conducive to
     reaching consensus on issues.

     On a Zone-wide and Interzone level I have been involved in several
     areas:

     1. I actively participated in the search for, and nominated, several
     candidates for the "new" FTSC. All of my nominees were elected and,
     with the exception of [Craig Box, still serve.]

     2. I actively promoted the "multiple distribution system" concept
     which has led to the acceptance of a choice of uplink providers.
     This also promoted the emergence of additional free feeds.

     3. I have promoted the use of Fido/IP technology, interacting with
     FTSC members, developers, the RCC, the Z1C and the Z2C, to create a
     common standard and approach. As a result of my efforts, Zone 1
     introduced the 1:1/3xxx segment, which lists IP nodes in the Zone
     segment and raised awareness of this technology. I currently am
     administrating that segment.

     4. Together with David Hallford I introduced the INODELST FDN. This
     File Distribution Network distributes a weekly extract of IP nodes
     in a variety of formats. This FDN consists of a number of file echos
     which are available through the FileGate and the Filebone.

     5. Through interaction with a number of WC!5/WinServer nodes which
     wanted to join Fidonet I noticed the need for additional help files
     and tutorials. As a result I created a graphical tutorial on the
     setup of the Argus mailer, which allows a node to setup as a regular
     FIDONEWS 16-24               Page 4                   14 Jun 1999


     POTS node or a Fido/IP node.


     There is a lot more work to be done. Much of the work ahead will
     involve creating consensus among nodes from all Zones. I believe I
     can help create that consensus. I have good relationships with the
     Zone 1 RCC, the IC, the Z2C and the Z4C, as well as a number of
     developers and current FTSC members. Most of all, I have good
     relationships with "regular" nodes all over. I have a track record
     in my net, my region, and, as outlined above, also on a Zone and
     Interzone level.

     Editor:  I've added a small file_id.diz generator to the batch file
     which archives the newsletter.  The idea of adding the table of
     contents is a fine one, but it was a little beyond my capabilities
     on short notice.

     Forgive me, for I am new but just begining to follow up the Fido
     News. I have been a long time Sysop of a BBS up here in Bangor,
     Maine (USA). We've been running Wildcat! BBS since 1992 and
     currently run the Santronics WIN Server package, and their Platinum
     Express Fidonet program.

     Maybe I am that guy that is shouting to the stage from the back of
     the theater but I have to tell you, Fidonet has to be the most
     difficult of all the networks to join, yet its eyed as the best of
     them all.  While many BBSs were dropping left and right, the few
     that did remain and convert to offering access via the Internet have
     all but been ignored by the Fido folks for all too long.  My modem
     users quickly left my services in favor of the local ISPs.  As a
     result, I have no modem lines and haven't had them since 1996.  I
     get more visits and business from people OUT of my local calling
     range than I ever did with a modem line, so the old requirement of a
     modem line quickly annoyed me and convinced me Fido was slow to move
     with technology.

     But, thankfully, it appears things have changed.

     Now, I am in the process of getting my system configured to join
     Fidonet. Todd Cochrane has been key to getting me in Fido, as has
     FIDONEWS 16-24               Page 6                   14 Jun 1999


     Andrea Santos from Santronics Software.  But where has Fidonet been?
     It DOES appear to be a monarchy of sorts, from this spectators eyes,
     anyways.  And the Princes and Lords of each region seem to pass
     along different versions of Fidonet policy towards Net Systems.

     Why is there such anxiety over Net-BBSs (or Web BBSs, as many of us
     call them)?  I think its amazing that some Web-Oriented Systems have
     endured the wave of the Internet.  But rather than Fido welcoming us
     in with open arms, it seems as though we are treated like a leper or
     something.  It seems that all to many measure a BBS merely by if you
     have a modem attached to your system.  That seems prejudiced, at
     best.  If I know I have no modem callers anymore, why should I
     invest in the cost of a modem and a reccuring monthly bill?  Just
     for the namesake of 'qualifying' to carry Fidonet?  I think not.

     And that's why I have joined other systems that have seen the light.
     RIME/RelayNet has been the easiest network of all to join.  I have
     recommended and seen many Sysops join RIME and gleefully welcome the
     1,200 or so messages a day filter in through their systems.  Sure,
     its not Fidonet, but you dont have to be a politician to get in.

     But I digress...

     IF Fidonet is truly trying to pull in new nodes, you folks have to
     see the big picture.  BBSs are on the decline.  Many are either gone
     or on the way. Then again, many have jumped onto the Internet, like
     myself, and found a niche for themself (like in my case, we host
     several websites for customers)...others have gone from large BBS to
     very successful ISP.  And of course, there are some BBSs out there
     that seem lost in time, still chugging along, taking numerous ANSI
     calls a day over their modem lines. And I envy them.

     DONT make it a royal act of congress to get in.  Here's a daring
     thought...how about INVITING systems to join in?  Why not have other
     Sysops mention it to sysops that are not in the network?  Fido has
     always struck me as an elitist click of people...you are required to
     run special software, follow huge rules and regulations, and you are
     effectively assimilated into some huge collective.  I'm finding
     (thanks to the aforementioned folks) that Fido DOES have a lot to
     offer, once you wade your way through the crap.  You folks need a
     facelift, and some attitudes need changing.  You can grimace and
     despair and the number of systems dwindling from your network...or
     you can make a valiant effort to remdy it some, by showing folks
     that you truly want more Nodes and welcome those that have gone to
     the Internet as a means to stay connected.

     Sorry for the rant, I open it has fallen on an open mind.

     Z1C Election Conspiracy
     * By Joe Jared 1:103/301@fidonet joejared@fidonews.webworldinc.com

     To those of you confused, this is a response to the
     participants of the super_bitch echo.  As soon as a full
     archive is made available to me, I'm quite sure I will be
     sickened even more by some of our participants in the
     z1_election echo, but in the mean time some changes have
     been made to this article to complete a few thoughts, seeing
     as my tosser stole the message out from under me and sent it
     upstream before it could be completed.  To continue...

     I just finished reading 80 messages in the super_bitch echo,
     and am completely discusted with the lack of maturity of you
     individuals.  Anyone who has actively participated in that
     echo at the level I've seen will be cut if their post
     attacks a candidate in any way and is dated after June 12th.

     In particular:

     Ruth Argust:
     Get a life.  If you think anything you do would change my
     opinion of any candidate, you need to rethink things.  Even
     before reading that echo I suspected what you were up to,
     and sent notices to you.  In your case, the date is June 11.
     In particular, your coordination of this effort to ruin this
     election is something that at some level should require
     punishment. Fortunately for you, this is echomail, but your
     tampering with the election is something that should be
     considered at bare minimum, annoying.  My own personal
     choice of who I would want Has no bearing on this.  Fair is
     fair, and what you are doing is wrong.  Additionally, as
     Douglas Myers posted, I think you should consider the fact
     that a year ago, when we in region 10 were all fighting
     against a conspiracy to have you excommunicated, you in turn
     have become a conspirator.

     "Lesley-Dee" Dylan:
     Your proposed attacks of Dallas Hinton because Todd is "dead
     in the water" will result in you being treated in like
     manner.

     Other participants in the super_bitch echo:
     Guilt by association.  If anyone of you participating in
     this echo berates, baits, taunts, or otherwise attacks a
     candidate, you will be cut from z1_election.  As soon as my
     archives of that echo are received, I will start taking
     names out of it.  If I find less than honorable
     participation you will be put on notice one time and then
     cut.

     Thank you for your high road message.  I would suggest that
     you disassociate yourself from the participants of the
     super_bitch echo, so that at bare minumum, you could get a
     fair shake at the election.  What they are doing isn't fair,
     and isn't right.  Then again, who knows what I find in the
     entire super_bitch archive.  If you were active then, and
     ultimately chose to take the "high road", my hat's off to
     you.

     Summary:
     The participants of the super_bitch echo owe Zone 1 an
     appology. Whether or not it will ever be seen is
     questionable, but it's a debt owed.  You couldn't have
     thought even in your wildest imaginations that you would get
     away with this, could you?  Seriously!

     Hi Douglas,

     =================================================================

                               The Easter Mass

     Years ago in Ireland there was a priest who was very anti-British.
     Every Sunday he would blast them from the pulpit. He became so
     notorious that the pope himself summoned the priest to Rome for an
     audience.

     "Father," said the pope, "I want that there should be peace between
     the British and the Irish. You're not helping matters at all. I want
     you to kiss my ring and swear by the Blessed Virgin that you'll
     never so much as mention the British in public again."

     "But your grace, I - I - " the priest stammered.

     "No buts," said the pope. "Swear it here and now or I'm going to
     excommunicate you!"

     "Aye, Holy Father," sighed the father. "All right. I swear it."

     The very next Sunday just happened to be Easter. And the father was
     back at his pulpit in Ireland giving his annual Easter sermon. He
     got to the part of the Easter story where Jesus said, "And one of
     you shall betray Me."

     The father continues: "Saint Andrew jumps up and says, 'Is it I
     Lord?' and the Lord says, 'Nay, Andy darlin, it's not you. Sit down
     now and dunna worry. Eat your supper.' Then Saint John the Divine
     gets up with tears in his eyes and cries, 'Is it I Lord?' And the
     Lord says, 'Nay, Johnny me boy, it's not you. Sit down now and dunna
     fret yourself. Eat your supper.'

     "Then that dirty dog Judas Iscariot slowww-ly rises to his feet. And
     he looks the Lord right in the eye and says, 'Blimey, Mate. Ya think
     it's me?"
