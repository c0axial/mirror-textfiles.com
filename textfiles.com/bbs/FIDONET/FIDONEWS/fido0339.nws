                       Ham Radio EchoMail Conference

     With the increasing overlap of bulletin board interest and  those
     with  interest  in  Ham  Radio,  it is passing strange to me that
     someone has not started this conference long ago,  but  alas,  as
     Thom  Henderson  has  said before,  it's almost always left up to
     someone taking the bull by the horns and giving it a tug, so here
     goes...

     Many  of  you  presently  run  boards  that  specialize  in  some
     particular aspect of the  Amateur  Radio  hobby  such  as  Packet
     Radio,  Contesting, VHF/UHF, etc.  The greatest service you could
     do is to disseminate the great ideas,  yes,  even  groundbreaking
     ideas that originate with your users.  In turn, you would receive
     a  like  service  funnelled  into  your  board  from all over the
     country and perhaps the world.  Moreover,  there probably isn't a
     problem  you  are  experiencing  that  hasn't been solved by some
     fellow ham somewhere.  If I can judge by  the  responsiveness  of
     the National Technical Conference, I have seen multiple fixes for
     problems  submitted there returned in as little as two days.  You
     just can't ask for better service  than  that!  Compare  that  to
     submitting  it  to  "QST" or "Ham Radio" and awaiting some future
     issue for your answer. (You guys up there in Newington listening?
     Hope "QST" will sign up as a conference node quickly).

     To this end,  I have established a National Ham Radio  Conference
     anchored  in  the  north woods of Atlanta,  Georgia with the hope
     that I won't be left on my own to make  it  interesting,  lively,
     informative  and  factual.  The name of the conference is simply:
     HAM and as of this moment,  -I- am the only official node in  the
     conference.  Although,  very  soon,  I hope to have Marv Shelton,
     WA2BFW at 107/319  and  Rene  Champagne,  VE2RI  at  167/101,  as
     additional distribution nodes (and, yes, Rene, you'll need to get
     EchoMail  up to do this).  This would take care of the southeast,
     mid-Atlantic and eastern Canada as a start.  What is  needed,  is
     about 10 to 15 other nodes about the country (and the WORLD!)  to
     step up to the bar and volunteer; what say you guys?

     To  review  what  is  needed,  without  going  into an exhaustive
     EchoMail tutorial, is to:

          1.   Set  up  an  appropriate  directory to contain
               your conference.

          2.   Place a DIR.BBS in the  directory  identifying
               what the conference or  message  area  is  all
               about.  Mine reads:

                      National Amateur Radio Conference

          3.   Add  an entry in your AREAS.BBS file something
               like the following:

                       9 HAM 107/319 167/101

                       |
                       +-----------------> The number of  the
                                           SYSTEMnn.BBS  file
                                           associated    with
                                           your   message  or
                                           conference area.

               One important reminder.  Since you can  always
               receive   EchoMail,   unless   you  expect  to
               distribute EchoMail to other nodes  than  your
               pickup node, do not list any other nodes.

          4.   If this is your first EchoMail conference, you
               will  need  to create a special event prior to
               and immediately after the National  Mail  Hour
               to  run  the EchoMail utilities,  Scanmail and
               Tossmail respectively.  Mine are:

                              4 ALL 03:55 1 X 4
                              5 ALL 05:30 1 X 5

               Which  instructs Fido  to schedule an eXternal
               event of one minute  duration  at  03:55  with
               return code 4 and another one  at  05:30  with
               return code 5 every day.

          5.   Add to your RUNBBS.BAT the following:

                        if errorlevel 5 goto postmail
                        if errorlevel 4 goto premail
                                      .
                                      .
                        :premail *** EchoMail Preparation
                        scanmail run >>echomail.log
                        arcmail to 133/10 (pickup node)
                        runbbs
                        :postmail *** EchoMail Distribution
                        arcmail from 133/10
                        tossmail run >>echomail.log
                        runbbs

               Two matters I  should  note:  If  you  haven't
               discovered it already,  the errorlevel test is
               equivilent to "equal to or greater  than"  and
               as   illustrated  above,   you  must  test  in
               DESCENDING order to assure correct  operation;
     Fidonews                     Page 4                   13 Oct 1986


               and,  the  ARCMAIL  step  in  the  batch  file
               fragment above is optional but since -I-  will
               be distributing it that way, you will at least
               have to unARC the stuff I send you and it does
               significantly  reduce  transmission  times and
               thus  LD  moneys.   I  will  leave  it  as  an
               exercise   for  the  reader  to  decipher  the
               options used above by reading  each  utility's
               documentation.

          6.   Unless  your daddy left you a sizeable fortune
               or your company installed a WATS line at  your
               house,  you probably wouldn't want to foot the
               bill for distribution to the  nodes  that  you
               serve  long  distance.  Also,  since  I too am
               poor,  those of you picking up  from  my  node
               will  have to POLL 133/10 in order to get your
               nitely fare.  In the ROUTE.?  file that  kicks
               off  your nitely National NetMail period,  you
               will have to  insert  the  following  (assumes
               that you are calling me for pickup and you are
               distributing to 999/100 and 998/2):

                           NO-ROUTE 999/100, 998/2
                           SEND-TO ALL
                           HOLD 999/100, 998/2
                           POLL 133/10

               An  analogous  operation  would be coded up by
               each of your distribution  nodes  substituting
               your  node  number  for  mine and less the NO-
               ROUTE and HOLD stuff if they in  turn  do  not
               distribute.

               To  quote  from  the EchoMail Manual:  "...the
               best  way  to  tie things together ...  boards
               always POLL upstream and HOLD downstream."

               (If  I  err  here or there is a simpler way to
               accomplish this,  I humbly await the onrush of
               help that I am sure to receive [:-)} ).

          7.   Finally,  after you're all set up,  contact me
               or the nearest node to you by NetMail or phone
               and let us  know  when  to  hook  you  in  and
               whether  you  want all messages then currently
               in the conference or  just  those  originating
               thereafter.

     I started  out  by  saying  that  I  wasn't  going  to  write  an
     exhaustive  tutorial on EchoMail but from the looks of it I waxed
     somewhat lengthy *grin* and I  trust  I  haven't  made  it  sound
     tougher than it is.

     As  the  topology  of  the conference develops,  I will NetMail a
     Conference Directory to major distribution nodes and  publish  it
     Fidonews                     Page 5                   13 Oct 1986


     here  from  time  to  time.  In this respect,  I would appreciate
     NetMail anytime you make a new connection or one  is  dropped  so
     that the directory can be kept accurate.


     You may contact me, John Dashner WA4CYB:

          via NetMail at 133/10 (404) 476-7970
          via OldMail at 2792 Kenwood Dr., Duluth, Ga. 30136
          via LandLine at (404) 476-1797
          via 20 meters whenever I get my rig back from Kenwood!
          (Note the street address - doesn't do any good)

     In conclusion, I would like to thank Jeff Rush of the Rising Star
     Fido  (124/206)  for conceiving of and implementing EchoMail.  He
     should be remembered by the networking historians for  developing
     a  utility  that gives you just about everything that UseNet does
     without half the hassle.  Without needing Jeff's permission, I am
     sure that I can speak for him in saying  that  the  best  way  to
     remember  him is to make shareware work by contributing $25.00 to
     him so that he will be encouraged  to  further  shorten  the  gap
     between the EchoMail and UseNet functionallity.  (Uh,  Jeff,  the
     check's in the mail!)

           The FidoNet Neopagan Witchcraft and Magick Conference

                       An Echomail Conference Profile
                by J. Brad Hicks, Sysop WeirdBase (100/523)
                       MAGICK Conference Coordinator


     In November of 1985,  several U.S. Senators and Congressmen began
     to  introduce legislation which would have swept away nearly  all
     of  the  Neopagan churches,  and which could have been used as  a
     weapon against any alternative religion.   To combat these bills,
     Circle Sanctuary (in Madison,  Wisconsin) mailed out thousands of
     flyers  (all first-class mail)  to everyone they knew  of.    The
     expense  was incredible,  but worth it--all three bills  died  in
     their respective committees (though the third one,  HR 3389,  was
     an uphill fight all the way to the end of the session).  In order
     to reduce the expense, should the need arise again,  the folks at
     Circle  suggested  something they called the Pagan Strength  Web.
     It would be a mailing list designed to hit as many cities as pos-
     sible as quickly as possible, where each contact would be respon-
     sible for spreading the word within his or her city by phone  and
     personal contact.   As a Pagan Strength Web contact myself, I saw
     at once how FidoNet mail could be used to spread word quickly  to
     many cities,  and so I buried notices in my next few articles for
     FidoNews asking for fellow Crafters who use FidoNet to contact me
     at 100/523.

     About that time, Jeff Rush released Echomail. When my PSW FidoNet
     mailing list and Echomail came together, the MAGICK Echomail con-
     ference  was  born.   Originally,  the conference  was  built  by
     merging message areas from three  boards:  my Neopagan Witchcraft
     area (on 100/523),  Josh Gordon's introductory and  miscellaneous
     area (125/93, now 161/93), Mizmoon's astrology area (101/27).  In
     addition,  Gene Clayton (12/4)  expressed interest in polling for
     it, and was followed almost immediately by Tom Kenny (107/316).

     The growth of the MAGICK conference parallels the growth (and the
     growing pains) of Echomail itself.  In the beginning, our message
     traffic was 2-4 messages per night (not per board per night, mind
     you), and so I encouraged people to use host-routing and to route
     all messages to all boards.   This lasted for  almost a month be-
     fore rioting broke out.   Nets 125 and 107  refused to host-route
     Echomail,  no matter how low the volume.   Josh Gordon refused to
     send  mail  to  some  of the boards.   Each new  sysop  has  made
     d/e/m/a/n/d/s/   suggestions for what they wanted the topology to
     look like.  This led us through a series of patch-work topologies
     to something approximating our current form. Then WeirdBase moved
     to  new hardware and SEAdog came out with a new version,  and  lo
     and  behold  they weren't compatible,  which meant we had to  re-
     design the topology all over again.

     But  in that same span of time,  we settled down into a  topology
     that works,  more or less,  and expanded beyond my wildest fanta-
     sies.   The MAGICK conference now shuttles an estimated 430  mes-
     sages  per month between 13  boards in 11  cities (in the US  and
     Fidonews                     Page 7                   13 Oct 1986


     Canada), with no round-trip longer than 5 days.   The topics have
     ranged from Discordian pranks to Thelemite texts, from distingui-
     shing ourselves from  Satanism  to (in)tolerance of Christianity,
     from Aleister Crowley to Laurie Cabot, from shamanism to UFOs and
     the pyramids. The conversation is occasionally thought provoking,
     often  very funny,  and almost without exception a Good Read  for
     folk  interested  in  any aspect of Neopaganism,  Wicca,  magick,
     Thelema,  Discordianism,  or any other aspect of New Age religion
     and philosophy.


     TECHNICAL SPECS:   The MAGICK conference uses a stars-on-a-string
     topology, with 100/523 and 161/93 as the major hubs, and 163/5 as
     a  secondary hub for Canada.   All boards are using Echomail ver-
     sion 1.31 (1.30 with the no-? patch by Josh Gordon).  Most boards
     are using ARCmail version 0.37  or 0.40.   If you wish to connect
     to the Magick conference,  send a note to Brad Hicks  at 100/523.
     If  you are not local to an existing MAGICK board,  you  will  be
     expected to POLL either 100/523 or 161/93 for it every night.

     A nearly complete text of all of the discussions is available  on
     WeirdBase (100/523) in file area 1, as MAGICKON.01 to 29.

     Tim Evans
     Fido 114/1

     I would first like  to  thank  Jerry  Hindle  of  123/6  for  his
     comments  on  my program,  MAILCOST.  The lack of comments I have
     received (either good or bad) has  been  the  most  disappointing
     thing about writing the program.

     The  major point Jerry makes is that mailcost accounting needs to
     be consistent with Fido's accounting.  Why?  Fido's accounting is
     inconsistent with the actual telephone bill accounting, even if a
     markup  is considered to cover additional costs.  (In Phoenix,  a
     message to California costs the same as a message to  New  York).
     There  was  never  any intent for the host or sysop to credit the
     individual users with the savings,  but hopefully  to  lower  the
     average  cost  per  message  for  all  users to all destinations.
     Whether this savings was passed on or is used to cover additional
     costs or even to make a profit was none of my concern.

     Regarding your repair shop example,  the cost (if different  from
     the  original estimate) will always be at least half the estimate
     - never more! I don't think that will cause too many complaints.

     The other issue I  see  is  whether  MAILCOST  should  deal  with
     individual  user costs or not.  I could be wrong on this,  but my
     feelings  are  as  follows:  Fido  handles  all  individual  cost
     accounting  between  the  users  and  the  sysops.  MAILCOST  was
     designed to handle cost  accounting  between  the  host  and  the
     sysops (nodes). While the host may also be the sysop or the user,
     I  think the 2 functions should be kept seperated.  I don't think
     the host needs to be concerned about the individual user's  costs
     - that is the sysop's job.

     I  could  be  wrong  on my impressions on how the host accounting
     should work. I will be writing an article for Fidonews to attempt
     to generate some discussion on this issue.  Thanks again for your
     comments.

     Kilgore Trout, 107/7
     FidoNet Study Group

                             A Modest Proposal
                                    for
                   The Commercial Exploitation of FidoNet


                  (Well it got your attention, didn't it?)


     Various people are now coming to realize the  enormous  potential
     in  an  electronic mail system based on PC's and autodial modems,
     and are attempting to cash in on it.  Given that this is  already
     happening, why don't we see what WE can do?

     In FidoNet we have a large and sophisticated mail network already
     in  place  which  is  capable  of handling a large volume of mail
     traffic with a good success rate for overnight delivery.  The key
     problem is how to take  advantage  of  it,  while  not  offending
     anyone.  Certain criteria must be met:

     1) We must not offend the amateurs who comprise the net.

     2) It  must be possible for any given Fido operator to choose not
        to participate.

     3) Participating Fido operators must  be  compensated  for  their
        efforts and for the commercial use of their systems.

     4) It must remain possible for amateur Fido operators to join the
        net and to operate without additional cost.

     5) It must be possible to bill commercial users without depending
        on accounting data supplied by the local Fido operators.

     6) In general, accounting and billing must be humanly possible in
        some way, preferably with a minimum of effort.


     I  believe I have come up with an approach which will satisfy all
     of these goals.  Implementing my method  will  call  for  certain
     changes  in how Fido operates,  along with certain changes in the
     FidoNet packet format.  I will detail the required changes first,
     and then show what they can accomplish.  Please bear with me.

     The most difficult part operationally  is  altering  the  FidoNet
     packet  format.  I  anticipate a period of near total chaos while
     some Fidos are sending packets that other  Fidos  cannot  unpack.
     This  confusion  may  be  unavoidable  anyway,  in  view  of  Tom
     Jenning's avowed intention of implementing country support.



     Required Changes:

     Fidonews                     Page 12                  13 Oct 1986


     FidoNet  currently  understands  two  levels:   nets  and  nodes.
     Implementing  country support will require another level,  zones,
     higher than the net number.  To support commercial mail  traffic,
     Fido should also have yet a fourth level added under nodes.  This
     lowest  level  would consist of "subnodes" under a given node.  I
     somehow ended up calling them "points",  so I will continue to do
     so for lack of a better word.

     The final hierarchy would look something like this:

         Country          1
         Net            100
         Node            51
         Point            8

     A full net address specifying all four levels might look like this:

         1:100/51.8


     Each  existing node would double as "point zero".  If no point is
     specified in an address, then the message would go to the node.

     One major aspect of points is that  they  are  optional.  A  node
     does  not have to have any points under it,  and in fact does not
     even have to know that there is such a  thing.  All  nodes  would
     ignore  points belonging to other nodes,  and points would not be
     listed in the node list.

     A point would communicate only with its own  node.  It  does  not
     need (and should not have) phone numbers for any nodes other than
     its own.  One may suppose that operators of points may swap phone
     numbers  so  that  they  may  exchange  files,  but this need not
     concern us as far as operation of the net is concerned.

     The phone number for any given point would be needed only by  the
     node which "owns" the point.  No other nodes would need or should
     have it.



     Commercial Users:

     Commercial   users   of  FidoNet  would  be  set  up  as  points.
     Accounting would be handled as a flat subscription fee per  month
     for  unlimited use of the network.  The subscription fee would be
     split out among the participating nodes on  a  percentage  basis.
     One possible way of doing this would be:

         60% to the node which handles the point.
         30% to the host which serves that node.
          5% to the regional coordinator who handles that area.
          5% to the national office.

     As  one  moves up the hierarchy the percentages get smaller,  but
     the number of points covered increases,  so total revenues should
     Fidonews                     Page 13                  13 Oct 1986


     increase as well.  Per point returns are high for the local node,
     which  should  compensate  him  for  dealing  with  the points on
     occasion as well as providing him with incentive to  obtain  more
     points.  But as one moves up the ladder and becomes more involved
     with network operation, ones compensation increases accordingly.


     I envision the operation as working something like this:

     1) A commercial user decides to sign up for FidoNet,  either as a
        result of advertising,  or from being canvassed by a node.  He
        fills out an application and sends it to St. Louis.

     2) The central office verifies his credit card number and informs
        the  participating  node  closest  to  him  (or  the  node who
        canvassed him).

     3) The node handling the new user adds him to  his  "point  list"
        and helps him get started.

     4) Each  month  the  central office charges a subscription fee to
        his credit card, calculates the payments to each participating
        node, and mails out the checks.

     5) Whenever the point decides to leave,  the central office stops
        charging  his  card  and  notifies his point that he has left.
        The node then drops him from his  point  list  and  no  longer
        handles mail for him.



     Ramifications:

     With  this system,  all network and regional coordinators must be
     willing to participate.  This may be a disadvantage, but may also
     result in a higher level of dedication among the coordinators.

     Local  nodes,  however,  need not participate if they do now want
     to.  In fact,  it would be a mistake to involve any node who  was
     not actively willing to join.

     The  amateur  network  is  preserved.  Amateur Fido operators may
     still join at the node level,  and may send mail  without  charge
     (other  than  phone bills).  Commercial users may attempt to form
     their own nodes for this  purpose.  Participating  nodes  can  be
     alerted  to  watch  for  this,  providing us with policing at the
     local level.  It is obviously in the interests of a participating
     node to do this.  A commercial node in his area should rightly be
     a point under his node, so he is losing revenue.

     Since points will not be listed in the node list,  we may want to
     publish  a  "point  list"  (sort  of  a phone book).  This should
     probably be covered by the cost  of  a  subscription.  We  should
     probably  ask on the application form whether or not a commercial
     user wishes to appear in the point  list.  I  have  no  idea  how
     often such a thing should be published.
     Fidonews                     Page 14                  13 Oct 1986


     Selling It:

     This obviously won't work unless we can sell it  to  the  present
     sysops.  We  don't  have  to get everyone to participate,  but we
     don't want to get too many people upset, either.  Fortunately, we
     have two recent examples to guide us.

     1) US  Robotics is selling us 2400 baud modems at a reduced price
        (comfortably above distributor cost), and is seen as a hero.

     2) GTE  is  selling  us  long  distance  telecommunications  at a
        reduced price (during their slack time),  and  is  seen  as  a
        villain.

     Why  is  one a hero and the other a villain?  Both are exploiting
     the BBS community.

     I believe that the reason is because USR is  seen  as  practicing
     favoritism.   They   are  singling  out  the  sysop  for  special
     treatment, while GTE is not.  (Indeed, a user might see the roles
     of hero and villain the other way around!)

     I  believe  that  this  approach will be palatable to Fido sysops
     because it is rank favoritism of the worst (best)  sort.  We  are
     singling  out Fido sysops and telling them,  "We won't bother you
     in any way, but you can make some bucks if you want to."



     Conclusion:

     I like it.  It gives us all a chance to make a  buck,  and  gives
     something  back  to the dedicated amateur.  I can envision people
     setting up nodes just to make money handling commercial mail, but
     the backbone of the idea is the  dedicated  amateur  sysop.  It's
     high time a sysop got something for his efforts.

                DBASEII: CURES FOR SOME COMMON FRUSTRATIONS

                             By G. R. Realmuto

     dBASE is noted for being a very powerful yet difficult program to
     learn.  I love it  for  this  very  reason.  Like  a  person  who
     collects  rare  objects,  I  enjoy  learning and mastering skills
     others choose to avoid.  I've been frustrated many  times.  Error
     messages,  syntax errors,  and losing control of the keyboard can
     make you crazy.  Below are a number of  frustrations  and  how  I
     cured them.  Enjoy!

     Frustration  1:  Don't  forget  to  enclose  print  statements in
     quotes: "SUCCESS."

     Frustration 2:  IF statements can be nested but must end with  as
     many ENDIF's as there are IF's.

     Frustration  3:  DO  WHILE  statements  cannot  be  nested.  Very
     important!

     Frustration 4:  DO WHILE statements may have IF then ELSE nested,
     but remember to end with ENDIF then ENDDO.

     Frustration  5:  You  cannot  TRIM  numerical  fields  or  memory
     variables.

     Frustration 6: You cannot add numerical data to character fields,
     etc.  Use STORE VAL (string) to MVAR.

     Frustration 7:  You  lose  control  of  the  keyboard.  Type  SET
     CONSOLE ON.

     Frustration  8:  ACCEPT  TO  statements  with  following IF's are
     character variables and need quotes.

     Frustration 9:  INPUT  TO  statements  with  following  IF's  are
     numerical and of course do not require quotes. e.g.:

          ACCEPT "WHAT COMMAND WOULD YOU LIKE" TO CHOICE
            IF CHOICE = "QVB"
              QUIT to "vdo," "dbase menu"
            ELSE
               IF CHOICE = "DFA"
                    DISPLAY files on A like *.*

            ENDIF

          Hello again.....

          I bet your getting tired of seeing all these articles from me
     now, aren't you? Well guess what you got more coming your way.

          In this weeks installment I would like to share a few things
     with you that I have noticed since I wrote the FidoUtil article in
     Fnews 336.

          First and foremost, I (and the authors of FidoUtil) have had a
     pretty good response from that one, more so then the Mailcost review.
     The authors do request from both you and I that ALL BUG reports for
     FidoUtil be sent to 151/3 not 151/2 as I originally told you. For
     this I apologize.

          Now on to better things. The version I reviewed for Fnews was
     1.10 and I have since (actually within hours of sending the article
     in) acquired version 1.20 of this tremendous program. In this version
     the authors have ADDED the following utilities:

          DTR     TASK     LOG     SPACE     DATEFILE & JULIAN
          NODEDATA

          They have also added an environment setting to it so you may
     configure FidoUtil to boot up the way you want it. They have also
     UPDATED the following utilities from version 1.10:

          LASTUSER     RICOCHET     USERLIST     TWIX     SCHED

          Now you may ask, just what did they do to update these
     utilities, well I'll tell ya ! THEY LISTENED to a user (ME) and made
     almost all the changes I requested in the original article, plus some
     I hadn't even thought about. While they were at it they added the
     utilities shown above. I will attempt to give you a brief rundown of
     what the NEW stuff does;

          DTR:  This little utility will allow you to control the modems
     DTR from DOS. You may either turn DTR on (ie enable the modem) or OFF
     (ie disable the modem).

          TASK:  This one is adds the ability to have a BAT file ask for
     user input and act on this input OR LACK OF INPUT. This will give you
     the ability to have a bat file branch on user input or continue or
     halt if no input. It is extremely flexible in use and configuration
     depending on the BAT file itself.

          LOG:  Keeps a separate LOG file for use with either OUTSIDE or
     any other program once outside FIDO environment. You specify what
     goes into the log file as far as text goes. It will add the date
     stamp and time stamp to what you specify.

          SPACE: This will do one of two things...either show you how much
     space is left in the default dir of the default drive in 100k blocks
     or if you add a number after the command on the command line it will
     return an errorlevel based on how much space is left OVER the amount
     specified. If no amount is specified it will return an errorlevel
     based on the amount in 100k blocks (ie 7.2 meg would return an
     errorlevel of 72, since there are 72 100k blocks available on the
     drive)

          DATEFILE & JULIAN:  These two will rename any file based either
     on the JULIAN date or the SYSTEM date. If you use system date then
     you must add a new extension for the filename. If you use the JULIAN
     then you need to specify a new filename.

          NODEDATA: This is the best of the additions. If you want to know
     the information on an entry in the NODELIST.BBS file then you simply
     type in the net/node number and it will present you with the
     information on that entry in the nodelist. A HANDY ITEM !!!

          ENVIRONMENT SETTINGS: In this version of FidoUtil the authors
     have added the ability to customize the environment to your liking.
     While this is GREAT I can't go into detail here since there is simply
     to much info to present here.

          I would recommend you get this utility since it will make life
     vastly easier for any Fido sysop around.

          As a note to other shareware authors out there who may be
     reading this. The authors MARSHALL PRESNELL & BEN MANN have BOTH been
     in voice contact with me since I wrote the original article. This is
     a FIRST for me since I started writing articles along these lines. I
     have written articles on a few other utilities and in all fairness I
     must say that although some of them contacted me (via fidomail) NONE
     except BEN and MARSHALL offered to discuss in detail on VOICE
     connection their programs. Both of these authors have given me their
     voice numbers as they are genuinely interested in producing a QUALITY
     program. They have listened to my suggestions as well as my
     complaints. They have made corrections where needed and where
     corrections were not easily possible they have stated they will make
     the needed additions or corrections or suggestions as soon as
     possible. This is a first !!!!!! Every other author that even
     bothered to contact me has simply said they intend to keep it the way
     it is (not in so many words but that was the general idea from the
     message sent to me). MARSHALL has also stated that he will be
     releasing soon as a COMMERCIAL PROGRAM ONLY  an AUTOMATIC SYSOP ! I
     have seen what this program can do and if you have gotten a version
     of FidoUtil version 1.1 from 151/2 then you too have seen just a
     minute sampling of its capabilities. I am testing a DEMO version of
     this little GEM even as I type. I will let you know what I think as
     soon as I have given it a fair trial.

          To other shareware authors.....KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK ! If I have
     written about your "baby" and given it a terrible review then please
     contact me with an update...who knows maybe I will like it, BUT in
     ANY EVENT I will make it available for downloading here in the exact
     same state I receive it (barring transmission errors or bad file

     transfers). If you would like to add you "baby" to the growing list
     of FIDO support software available here, simply let me know and we
     can work out a means for me to get it from you.

          Well I guess I have rambled on long enough for this week..

          Stay tuned to this station next week same time (except on the
     south coast where it will be later) for more on the utilities as I
     find them.

     charges.  California residents add 6% tax.
