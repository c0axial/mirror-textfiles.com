     Greetings,

     Last weeks editorial about the ECHOLIST, did bring in a few netmails
     and e-mails, for which I thank you.

     All made some form or another comment, in that those echo's which
     do not form part of FidoNet, are gated between the 'othernet' and
     FidoNet, hence being listed.  Should the listing then also not
     display the gateway address, so that those who would like to obtain
     it, can make contact?

     Lekker lees.
     (Happy reading).

     Why Fido is at risk?
     by Adriano Garcia (former 4:801/53) adriano@visaonet.com

     When the Internet started to be as widespread as it is today,
     many people asked: "What is the future of FidoNet?". This question
     has no simple answer, but many factors may prove that Fido was
     doomed before the expansion of the commercial Internet.

     Let's start with a small personal biography: I was a sysop in
     Sao Paulo, Brazil back in 1993, when Fido was growing exponentially
     there and many things that I will expose here are commonplace for
     many of our readers.

     First, and foremost, the main factor that scares people away from
     helping the grow of Fidonet are the power trips. And they are present
     in different flavors to please everyone. One example: for a long time,
     before I joined Fido, local sysops were barred from entering Fido just
     because it was a `qualified network' that should be run only by the
     'best sysops'. Not for everyone. And the criteria used to determine
     who were the `best' were subjective, being the level of friendship
     with any *C a decisive factor.

     It's also a reality that Policy4 isn't what we could call a
     "democratic rule", but the same law can be interpreted differently
     by two different persons. That's why we have courts. But, when
     the person that enforces it is the same one that decides what
     is right, then we have a problem. Or a dictatorship, if you prefer.

     The last moment of growth of Fidonet Brazil was stopped by the first
     "ideological cleansing" of the history of cyberspace in South
     America. Many nodes were excommunicated just because they thought
     differently from the newly appointed RC of 1994. The curious about
     it is that the ones excommunicated had the same ideas of democracy
     and development of Fido that the RC had before being nominated...

     Now things seems to be getting back to normality, with another RC in
     place. But who will tell this to the many who closed down their
     systems just because it became one more problem instead of a pleasure?

     And what about the sysops who wish to return as mail-only nodes or
     point systems and cannot because nodes are charging big money for
     mail or because *Cs do not assign mail-only nodes anymore, even
     when there isn't a local BBS in the area?

     Now we have the Internet. And people say that Fidonet is a "competing
     network", with the Internet. An it's not. Fido is supposed to be an
     amateur network where people communicate and participate as a
     hobby, when the Internet is now a commercially oriented network that
     has a completely different technology and environment. And there are
     limitations in Usenet (the "Internet echomail") that are not present
     in Fido.
     FIDONEWS 15-36               Page 3                    7 Sep 1998


     They can really coexist. But only if the *C structure realises that
     they aren't the "owners" of the network but only the ones that
     *coordinate* the efforts of many into the development of a NEW
     Fidonet. It's obvious that the technology is already in place,
     with packets flowing through the Internet reducing the once
     expensive international mail exchanges. This should be, by itself,
     one good reason for Fido to expand, not to collapse.

     We can get Fido into the 21st century. But only if we stop pretending
     that we are dead and act. Putting people into the net, not keeping
     them out.

     (This may be my first and last submission to Fidonews, as the only
     one telnettable BBS that I know that provides free access to Fido
     is closing down and I have no other way to access the network
     anymore. Sad news...)

     -----------------------------------------------------------------


                 An Optimistic View of the Shrinking Nodelist
                 Douglas Myers   1:270/720   doug@mdtnbbs.com

     One of the most persistant topics of echotalk is the shrinking Fido
     nodelist.  That nodes are leaving Fidonet has been no big secret,
     but it's been most dramatic recently as the text copy of the
     international nodelist has gone below 2 megabytes where it was three
     just a few years ago.

     There's real concern here.  Some sysops want to revive BBSING by
     posting ads in the local laundromats.  Some want to put up an
     HTML-based BBS and go "head-to-head" against the Internet!
     Power-politicians are chastised for creating this net flight.
     Developers are being asked why our technology isn't better.  And at
     least one net is supplying local computer-buyers with instructions
     to turn Hyper-Terminal into the Fidonet Explorer.

     Will all this concern turn the situation around?  Will the BBS once
     again flourish and the Fido nodelist expand to consume our hard
     drives?  My optimistic guess is "No."

     Fidonet was never destined to own cyberspace.  It briefly (in an
     historical sense, anyway) caught the imagination of the world, and
     it even spurred that imagination on to greater things.  But it's
     role in history is more that of amateur radio.  Amateur radio
     operators were once king, and their association also spurred the
     imagination of the world.  But their role, too, was as harbinger. To
     see how the bbs system operator of the future fares, we can look at
     the amateur radio operator of today... they're still a strong,
     active group - still widely respected.  But they no longer own the
     airwaves, having passed it on to their heirs.

     The BBS sysop never owned cyberspace, but he took his turn at the
     helm when few could see where these machines called computers could
     take us.  He still stands tall in cyberspace.

     FIDONEWS 15-36               Page 4                    7 Sep 1998


     And Fidonet, the community of sysops, will be around for a while.
     Folks always come home to stay for a piece, and there are always
     those who keep a place prepared.  Even now, those who have mastered
     the technology of the internet are polishing Fido.  Our messages
     move faster and more reliably through new channels.  Some are adding
     new wings to the traditional structure.  And we're all gathered
     around the fire in the evening quibbling over the seating
     arrangements for tomorrow's dinner.

     We're busy getting ready for the folks coming home.


             -------------- Footnote --------------

     I'm hoping that this is the first of a few more editorials of an
     upbeat nature.  I'd like to explore the theme of preparing the ol'
     place for our guests... and maybe promote some methods for making
     our community a friendly place to stay in the vastness of
     cyberspace.  Whether I can follow through depends, of course, on my
     malicious employer who places crass commercial interests above
     community development.  And, of course, it depends on Henk Wolsink,
     who might fill the pages of Fidonews with the works of real writers
     and crowd me out before I can say my piece :)

     Dear Editorbeing,

     I trust that this article will find itself buried beneath
     the fold after the Artspec document in your esteemed organ.
     With any kind of luck, the momentum gained by all six
     readers of the Snooz as they lean on their <RETURN> buttons
     will carry them right past this drivel to the exciting
     Internet gating information. This article is submitted by
     Doc Logger (163/110) who was eagerly awaiting the 29,000
     pounds of bananas which Ruth Argust had shipped to his
     address.

     Roll da flic, Henk....

     Dear Reverend Visage,

     Nice work ace. Submitting your petty cash bills to Swamp
     Swine Magazine and asking for payment in Russian Rubles will
     surely prop up their sagging currency and avert a global
     meltdown of various economies. I guess you noticed that the
     Canadian peso is now worth slightly less than the virtue of
     an Australian woman.

     What amazes me in the various commentaries that I have read
     is that there is a lack of perception about what causes such
     huge currency fluctuations. What they fail to note is that
     currency trading is conducted by cocaine-crazed twenty year
     olds who wouldn't recognize a Gross National Product if it
     sat on their faces. The little snakes who do the buying and
     selling of foreign currencies are merely gamblers. The fact
     that they gamble with your jobs, your national economies,
     and inflate the costs of blended Scotch to ruinously high
     levels, is but a mere trifle. What really matters is that
     the money trading weasels will be paid six figure salaries
     without having put in a productive day's work in their
     lives. Only lawyers have a greater claim to being economic
     bloodsuckers.

     Mercifully, having invested all of my spare funds in badger
     sperm futures, I am immune to currency fluctuations. For
     those of global ambition, this seems like a golden
     opportunity because there must be countries who can be
     purchased for a mere $1.95 in hard currency.

     In last week's Snooz His Immensity, Jerry Schwartz, pointed
     out that Eldridge Cleaver had become a "diversity
     consultant" in his dotage. It could have been worse, Cleaver
     could have become either a sociologist or a statistician. I
     think most of the fervent revolutionaries of the 60s and
     70's have come to the realization that starving has its
     drawbacks. If George Washington were alive today, he'd be
     flogging fat free cookware on infomercials.

     Finding the pithy quote I wanted for this week's Chautauqua
     will be problematic because I decided to undo the work of my
     Evil Cleaning lady. My Evil Cleaning lady had arranged all
     of my books by colour and so I have attempted to put them
     back in alphabetical order. In the process, I have
     discovered an immutable law of bookshelves which states: If
     you unload several bookshelves and then attempt to put the
     books back, the shelves will become full long before the
     pile of books has been restored. Somewhere in the pile of
     books the one I want remains hidden. With the daunting
     prospect of finding a real quote, I shall dive into my
     journals and select something random and appropriate.

     "Your lamp isn't dead...it's just sick." Joe's Lamp
     Reconstruction, Miami, January 17, 1975.

     When I recorded that philosophical gem from a billboard, I
     had a sense that it served as a metaphor for not just ailing
     lamps, but also for America. When I recorded it, I was on my
     way to the sybaritic pleasures of a Caribbean Cruise (pass
     the prune juice, let's party) and was young enough to be
     optimistically naive about the future. To turn this into a
     proper Chautauqua, the metaphor should be expanded to
     encompass the notion that social systems aren't supposed to
     be terminal conditions, but rather systems capable of being
     "fixed." I see that same notion of futile optimism expressed
     by those who think that some gee-whiz technology applied to
     Fidonet will miraculously stave off its decline. In truth,
     adding IP connectability will just make for a better looking
     corpse, but won't breath any new vitality into the medium.

     Here at Cassandra's 'R Us, I believe that the only thing
     that matters is the content of messages. There is more than
     a little irony to be found in the fact that while my
     opinions are about as welcome as a skunk at a wedding, the
     style of my messages seems to make some people assert that
     they remain connected to some echos merely for the
     opportunity of reading my drivel. What most of these people
     don't realize is that most of the entertaining writers in
     Fidonet are long gone...discouraged by the cascades of
     quoted drooling and the generally cretinous approach to
     communication.

     I must go Visage. This has already gone on too long and I
     know that you'll be pleased that Andrea Santos has returned
     from her tryst with vegetables. As Fidonet's official
     Mistress of Antfarms she has been sorely missed. (Special
     note to Lee Aryton's finch: Cute buns, babe.) I had hoped to
     meet with you last week but your secretary informed me that
     you'd missed your flight for the fourteenth straight week.

     Regards,
     Doc Logger

     Ex-contributors and ex-staff members may only have until December 31,
     1998

     FACTNet alert
     August 26, 1998

     Ex-Scientologists who may be eligible for refunds and/or back-pay from
     Scientology may never have a better opportunity or more leverage to
     retrieve their money than between now and December 31.

     In December, 1998, Scientology s tax-exempt status will be reviewed by
     the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the final time, and then if
     the IRS is convinced Scientology has abided by its 1993 IRS agreement
     Scientology s nonprofit status will become permanent. Thus for the
     next few months, it is crucial for Scientology to see that its
     operations appear to be above legal reproach.

     According to Scientology s application for tax-exempt status, it must
     refund donations it has received if donors so request. If you feel you
     were deceived by Scientology or did not receive what you were
     promised, demand your donations back!

     And legally, Scientology could be liable to provide back-pay for the
     many who have labored long hours for the  church  far below minimum
     wage, often only receiving $10 or $24 per week. Receiving $24 for a
     40-hour workweek equals sixty cents an hour; for a not-unheard-of
     100-hour week, twenty-four cents an hour. An individual would be owed
     almost $10,000 for each year worked at $24 per week rather than a
     minimum wage of $5.15 an hour, assuming only a 40-hour workweek; at an
     80-hour week it would be over $20,000. It is illegal to pay workers
     less than minimum wage. Don't let Scientology get away with profiting
     from your slave labor! Demand the back pay you are owed.

     To request refunds and/or back pay, FACTNet would recommend sending
     a very brief letter to each of the organization(s) money was donated
     to or worked for, stating the amount of money requested, and providing
     a date by which it is expected (e.g., by October 31, 1998). Make sure
     you tell them who to make out the check to and where to send it.
     FACTNet will set up a section on the web site with sample letters
     (see www.factnet.org over the next week or so for details).

     If Scientology does not immediately recompense you be sure to report
     it to the IRS and/or to federal and state departments of labor. As a
     result, the IRS may not finalize the Scientology s nonprofit IRS
     status, and departments of labor may investigate illegal employment
     practices.

     FACTNet believes that people who are owed remuneration from
     Scientology deserve to know that the next few months are crucial.
     Please contact anybody and everybody you know who may stand to be
     justly compensated, and let them know this may be their last real
     chance to get their money back.

     =================================================================


                          The Dark Side of the Farce
                          Douglas Myers    1:270/720

     It's late at night, at the end of a weekend in which I tried to
     catch up on all the mail I didn't quite get around to reading during
     the work week.  The echos are still running through my mind and
     combining in unlikely ways.

     The ZEC echo is in an interregnum right now, Bob Kohl having been
     fired and Gary Gilmore, the interim ZEC, in somewhat of a pickle.
     Gary is charged by his job description with conducting an election
     for a new ZEC, but Bob Satti has apparantly charged the RECC with
     the task of determining how the new ZEC should be selected.

     Meanwhile, Bob Kohl has not been silent.  He is currently in a
     shouting war with John Souvestre charging him with lack of moderator
     support in the past.  John maintains that he just wanted a little
     bit of decorum - that maybe it was a good idea to talk with the
     local sysop or his uplink or the next uplink or the next uplink
     before asking for a feed cut for an entire net.

     And in the ever-popular SUPER-BITCH echo, the bitches are trying to
     assign the appropriate Fidonet Stars to the roles of the Seven
     Dwarfs.  As my eyes close I recall Bob Satti being nominated for
     Sleepy...

     ... and suddenly I realize the appropriate role for Bob Kohl.  What
     famous character was originally a force for Good (as many of his
     former supporters maintain) and a rising star in the Fido Empire
     before he finally succumed to the Dark Side?  Why it was Darth
     Vadar!

     Eyes still closed and slumber falling upon me, it doesn't occur to
     me that Darth never made the cast of Snow White.

     And what famous Princess, a member of the Imperial Senate, was
     chased across the galaxy by Darth and forced to retreat with her
     Rebel Alliance to a new region even as the mighty forces of Darth's
     Empire were destroying her home?  This would be Princess Ruth
     Argust, of course.

     One sysop, irate over zone 2 nodelist errors, has already ranted
     about "Satti the Hut."  Durn, that man takes a beating...

     But to my weary mind, another role is more suitable.  Which young
     man wishes to leave the farm and reach for the stars?  Though
     inexperienced and making a few mistakes along the way, he is
     nonetheless privy to some routed netmail to Obie Wan Kanobie and
     rushes to rescue the Princess.  As young Luke Satti embarks on his
     adventure, he finds that within himself are the seeds of the last
     Jedi Knight.  Though he must ultimately confront the Dark Side, he
     FIDONEWS 15-36               Page 11                   7 Sep 1998


     eventually rises to dispose of Darth Vadar.

     Drifting to sleep, I wonder who is Yoda, who will take Luke by the
     hand and teach him to use The Force.  As sleep overtakes, I recall
     that Yoda wasn't one of the Seven Dwarfs either...
