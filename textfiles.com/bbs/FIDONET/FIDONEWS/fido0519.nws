     George A. Stanislav
     Opus 1:129/39


                   The Four Astral Board Echos



     The logo of Astral Board, 1:129/39, is "The Unusual Board For
     Unusual People." Indeed, the whole purpose of Astral Board is
     discussing unusual things. Its two main local message areas are
     "Unusual Experiences" and "Martial Arts." Four echos have been
     born on Astral Board so far, all, hopefully, falling in the
     "unusual" category.

     The first and best known echo originating at Astral Board is
     80XXX. Its purpose is to get a public forum to anyone writing
     programs for the 8088 Intel chip and its derivatives, e.g.
     80286, 80386, 8087, etc.

     Another programming echo may not seem that unusual. After all,
     there is a general programmers' echo, a C echo, a Pascal echo
     and others. The "unusual" part of 80XXX is in its orientation
     towards low level programming of a specific chip, or rather a
     family of chips. Most of the discussion is about PC assembly
     language programming, although the echo is not limited to
     assembly language. As long as it has something to do with the
     low level programming of the Intel 80XXX chips, any message is
     welcome here.

     Another unusual thing about 80XXX echo is its file transfer
     protocol. If participants of the echo want to transfer chunks of
     code that will not fit into one message, or even if they want to
     transfer small binary files, they arc the file, convert it into
     an ASCII text file by John Navas's ECHOARC and post that text as
     a message. The recipient uses the same program to convert the
     message into an arc file. That is why all sysops carrying the
     80XXX echo are required to carry a copy of ECHOARC on their
     systems for download by their users.

     Unidentified Flying Objects are the topic of discussion of UFO,
     another unusual echo from the unusual board. The history of this
     echo is somewhat peculiar. Before I started it, I had no special
     interest in the UFO phenomenon. Some of my callers were
     attracted to my BBS by its name, Astral Board, in the hope they
     would find a UFO related discussion there.

     After several users expressed a desire for such an area, I
     agreed to start it, not as a local discussion, but an echo. To
     my great surprise, the day I started the echo, messages started
     coming from all over the country, mostly thanks to Aaron
     Schmiedel, sysop of Chai Way in Dallas, who spread the new echo
     FidoNews 5-19                Page 2                    9 May 1988


     all over the USA and even sent it to Europe.

     People who have personally viewed UFO's have participated in our
     discussion. For me the echo was an eye opener. While before I
     started the echo I would have probably treated anyone claiming
     to have seen a UFO with great suspicion, nowadays I have no
     doubt about the UFO phenomenon and even about its potential
     danger for our planet. Those alliens seem to be anything but
     friendly folks.

     STARGAZE is another echo started on request of others. The echo
     is dedicated to Astrology. The echo has started very slowly,
     and up to this point not much discussion has happened there.
     Mostly I asked people to help me find the algorithms for
     astrological calculations as I would like to write an online
     astrology program. If anyone can help in this regard, please
     post in STARGAZE.

     The fourth unusual echo is BBOS. This echo seems the most
     unusual of all, at least to me. I started it when several sysops
     requested an echo dealing with Opus Embedded Commands and AVATAR
     (Advanced Video Attribute Terminal) for which I wrote a
     compiler, OECC.

     While the request for the echo was strong, there rarely ever
     appear any messages in it. BBOS stands for Bulletin Board
     Operating System. The echo is open not just to the discussion of
     the currently available Opus Embedded Commands, but to
     suggestions for new ones. In fact, the echo can be an excellent
     meeting place of developers and users of different BBOS's to
     possibly create standard ways of embedding commands and screen
     control codes into text files that could be portable among the
     various bulletin board operating systems.

     Apparently this idea came too early before its time. The echo is
     very little used. Ironically, I came to the point when I wanted
     to discontinue the echo. I posted a message to that matter in
     other echos and received many answers asking me not to do that.
     Despite that, the traffic has been slow. I hope that after
     reading this article more people will become aware of this echo
     and its purpose.

     All four echos are available at the Stars. One of the Stars
     polls me every night for the echos and delivers the messages
     from other places.

     I would like to emphasize especially the presence of the last
     two echos, STARGAZE and BBOS, as it seems not many sysops are
     aware of their existence.

                 A POTENTIAL SECURITY PROBLEM IN OPUS
                 ------------------------------------

     Our turn?

     To every BBS, it seems, there comes a Hacker - and we've just
     had our first major attempt at gaining unauthorized access to
     our system.

     As  we  use Opus 1.03b which is,  to say the least,  a rather
     widely used system we have decided to  share  our  experience
     with  you in the hopes that you may avoid similar occurrences
     on your own systems.

     The  hacker  in  question  used a very simple,  but powerful,
     method which could - had things gone according to his plan  -
     have  allowed him to gain full control of the machine running
     Opus.  This  would  have  included  access  to  all  the  BBS
     utilities on the machine.

     Such a success would,  of course, meant that the hacker would
     have been able to completely cover his tracks,  even  leaving
     the Sysop unaware that his system had been compromised.

     Due to some luck (good for us,  bad for the hacker) he failed
     in his attempts to control our system,  and merely managed to
     crash it leaving the system down for several hours.

     A debate
     --------
     There  is  always  something  of  a  debate  over whether the
     methodology behind such things as Virus programs, Trojans and
     so on should be publicly revealed in full detail.

     The argument against full disclosure is seated  in  the  idea
     that  we should not risk telling other people how such things
     can be accomplished in the hope that no more people will find
     out than already know.

     Opposing this is the belief that only by letting people  know
     about  a danger,  and by fully informing them of that danger,
     can ways be developed to combat the danger.

     The two arguments might be summarized as the "Keep quiet  and
     hope it goes away" against the "Forewarned is forearmed".

     It  is  in  the  light of the latter belief that this article
     will explain what the hacker did, and how he did it.

     I do of course advise all those who think their systems might
     be susceptible to this line of attack to  protect  themselves
     at once in the manner I will describe shortly.

     FidoNews 5-19                Page 4                    9 May 1988


     The Method
     ----------
     Basically what the hacker did was to take  advantage  of  the
     fact  that  we do not make much use of the *.GBS files in our
     Opus system.

     For  those  unfamiliar  with  .GBS  files  I  should pause to
     explain that these are the graphic equivalents  to  the  .BBS
     files  containing  system  logos,  file lists,  menus and the
     like.

     People with ANSI graphics set ON will see what is in the .GBS
     files,  while  those with it off will see what is in the .BBS
     file.

     This allows users with ANSI capability to take full advantage
     of that  system,  while  still  producing  perfectly  legible
     displays for those without ANSI support.

     The  hacker  uploaded a file called FILES.GBS to a file area,
     as no such file existed previously the system allowed him to
     do this.

     This file was a text file containing OANSI embedded  commands
     to shell to DOS and perform various functions.

     These  included  DEL  *.LOG in a successful attempt to remove
     the system logs and so cover his trail.

     The  hacker  then tried to run the remote sysop utility using
     this system, luckily for us he was unaware of which com: port
     we are using.  By performing CTTY  with  the  wrong  port  he
     managed to crash the system.

     Protection
     ----------
     Protecting  against  further  attempts  to  do  this is quite
     simple,  we have now set the upload paths for all file  areas
     to  a  directory  that  is only available from a file area in
     which the F)iles and T)ypes command are disabled.

     Sysops will have to check this area and hurl (real problem as
     Opus won't hurl across multiple drives) files into the  areas
     they are intended for. Not entirely satisfactory, but it's a
     solution.

                         Your IFNA Working for You
                          Where DO those DUES go?

     Steve Bonine, 115/777


     There has been discussion in the sysop echomail conferences about
     whether there is a need for an organization like IFNA, what such
     an organization should do, and what IFNA is doing now.  I want to
     share with you a couple of things that IFNA is doing, right now,
     for the good of FidoNet.  You can agree or disagree about whether
     they SHOULD be done, HOW they should be done, WHO should do them;
     but at least you will be able to argue from a base of facts.

     Last September, Ken Kaplan was looking for someone to help him
     out with replies to inquiries received at the IFNA post office
     box.  I volunteered for the job because that aspect of IFNA is an
     important one -- it's all well and good to say that potential
     sysops can obtain information about FidoNet from a local BBS, but
     what do you do if you're in India, or if you don't know where the
     local BBS is?  The IFNA mailing address provides an important
     means of distributing information about what we are doing.

     The work that Ken wanted to delegate seemed simple enough -- send
     some sort of reply to folks who request information by writing to
     IFNA.  The pamphlet that Ken had been sending was a bit out of
     date.  (It doesn't take long for things to get out of date when
     it comes to FidoNet information!)  So I sat down with the old
     pamphlet, my trusty PCWrite and HP Laserjet, and came up with a
     new mailer.  Nothing fancy, but it worked.

     The response to PO-box inquiries consists of this little
     pamphlet, a list of help nodes, a list of all the FidoNet
     coordinators, and an IFNA order/application form.  It goes for a
     single unit of postage (two units international), and provides
     general information aimed at a diverse audience.

     The audience grew when PC Magazine ran a short article on
     FidoNet.  The article referred to a number on the reader-service
     card, making it very easy for people to generate an inquiry.  PC
     Magazine does a nice job of handling these "BINGO cards".  They
     send the target company (IFNA in this case) a post-card-sized
     form for each inquiry, with a peel-off mailing label.  There have
     been more than 500 requests from this one article.  It has been
     especially interesting to watch PC Magazine make its way around
     the world in the last few weeks as requests started to appear
     from South America, Europe, Africa, Asia. . . PC's are truly
     international.

     Back in the dark ages (a year or so ago), requests for
     information on FidoNet came primarily from potential sysops --
     people who were interested in starting their own BBS.  This has
     changed, with many more requests coming from potential USERS.
     These are people who have heard about FidoNet and echomail, and
     want to know what benefits the network has to offer to them as
     users.  This shows how FidoNet has matured to more than a network
     FidoNews 5-19                Page 6                    9 May 1988


     to facilitate communication between sysops.  Based upon this
     change in the mix of the audience, the material in the pamphlet
     has been revised to include more user-oriented information.  If
     you are interested in seeing the picture that IFNA is painting of
     itself, send me netmail (115/777) and I will gladly mail you a
     copy of the PO-box-inquiry mailing.

     To appeal to the potential sysop, a longer document provides a
     more detailed introduction to FidoNet.  This file, NEWSYSOP.TXT,
     has been made available for download on a number of systems
     throughout the network.  It provides an introduction to what
     options are available in BBS software, mailers, and echomail.
     The audience for this publication is technical enough to be able
     to cope with downloading from a local BBS, so this publication is
     not generally made available in printed form.

     So there you have it -- the attempts of one segment of IFNA to do
     something to help FidoNet.  Now let me preach a bit.  The work I
     have done for FidoNet has been quite rewarding.  I do it because
     I enjoy it.  Try it; you might enjoy it also.  You don't have to
     be "anointed" to be a part of the team; I hold no position in
     IFNA whatsoever.  I have found that many people criticize IFNA
     for "not doing anything" but there are mighty few who will
     actually pick up the ball and run with it.

     You want balls?  OK. . . here are a few things that need to be
     done.  Nick Baroque (104/413) has made the excellent suggestion
     that new systems receive a message from their IFNA director when
     they are added to the nodelist, providing them with a greeting
     and letting them know who their director is; in general, painting
     a positive picture of IFNA.  (Remember how exciting it was to get
     netmail right after your node number first appeared in the
     nodelist?)  We even have a volunteer who will send out the
     netmail.  What we need in order to implement this fine suggestion
     is a way to identify new nodes.  This is a bit more complex than
     a simple file matching program, since it has to weed out things
     like nodes that just changed their address.  Any whiz programmers
     out there want to tackle this one?

     More balls.  Mitch Kessler (107/269) has made another excellent
     suggestion that a local contact, perhaps a followup to the
     standard IFNA mailing, would be a valuable way to improve the
     public relations of FidoNet.  In fact, Mitch feels that FidoNet
     PR should be coming from the local nets.  Implementing this idea
     would require a network of systems organized geographically to
     provide this.  Are there enough folks out there to make this
     work?

     There are other projects which could be done.  Exposure in the
     national press, like the article in PC Magazine, counters the
     media's tendency to paint computer bulletin board systems as
     places where hackers and phreakers do their dirty work.  Is
     anyone in a position to get us more of this type of publicity?
     (It would be even nicer if we knew it was coming this time, so we
     could gear up to answer the inquiries.)  NEWSYSOP.TXT can always
     use a section on new products; to corrupt a popular phrase, "Send
     FidoNews 5-19                Page 7                    9 May 1988


     prose!".  Maybe there are areas in addition to new-sysop
     orientation that you feel should be addressed by a similar
     booklet.

     The purpose of this article is to point out that IFNA really IS
     accomplishing something.  There ARE reasons to have a national
     organization representing FidoNet, and two of them are providing
     a central location from which information can be requested and
     organizing a convention.  Both of these tasks are being done;
     you've read about the great progress towards a super FidoCon in
     other articles.  I hope to meet many of you at FidoCon this
     August!

     Kilgore Trout, 107/9
     System Enhancement Associates, Inc.


                          Etiquette and Protocols

     We've done a number of benchmark runs on  various  file  transfer
     protocols  over  the  last  few  years,  a few of which have been
     reported  in  FidoNews.   Our  last  published  benchmark  series
     compared SEAlink and Zmodem at 2400 baud.

     Recently   some  people  have  questioned  if  it  was  valid  to
     extrapolate the results of our 2400 baud trials to data transfers
     at 9600 baud.  In particular,  how would the Overdrive variant of
     SEAlink  compare  against  Zmodem?  We  were  confident  that our
     earlier results were still valid at the higher baud rate,  but we
     decided to confirm this opinion with hard data.

     For this benchmark series we used  an  IBM-AT  (sending)  and  an
     IBM-XT  (receiving)  connected  by  a  null  modem  cable  at  an
     interface speed of 9600 baud.  The  implementations  tested  were
     the  12/28/87 version of the DSZ.COM Zmodem protocol driver,  and
     version  1.25  of  the  OVERDRIV.EXE  SEAlink/Overdrive  protocol
     driver.   All   timing  was  done  using  Ben  Baker's  BENCH.COM
     benchmark timing  program.  The  benchmark  run  consisted  of  a
     series  of  files  with  varying sizes that were multiples of 128
     bytes (a "block" in SEAlink parlance,  or a  "sector"  in  Zmodem
     parlance).

     The following raw data was collected:

                Transfer time in seconds at 9600 baud

                Sectors      SEAlink        Zmodem

     BENCH.COM reports times to a  hundredth  of  a  second,  but  the
     MS-DOS  system  clock  is  only  accurate  to  an eighteenth of a
     second.  Hence,  the above numbers should be regarded as accurate
     to  one  tenth  of a second.  The hundredth place is retained and
     used to preserve the accuracy of the tenth place.

     As can be readily seen,  the two  protocols  are  very  close  in
     overall  performance.  When linear regression analysis is applied
     to the above data, the following results are obtained:

                             SEAlink        Zmodem

                Slope        0.1386         0.1392

                Intercept    4.3707         5.2133


     This form of analysis is useful because it resolves the data into
     two  significant  factors,   the  fixed  protocol  overhead  (the
     intercept), and the running per-sector transfer time (the slope).
     The above results could also  be  represented  as  the  following
     formulas:

                Transfer time for N sectors at 9600 baud, in seconds

                SEAlink      0.1386 N + 4.3707

                Zmodem       0.1392 N + 5.2133


     The question now arises of how consistent the data  set  is,  and
     how  much  margin  of error the testing procedure results in.  To
     answer this question we must  first  normalize  the  above  data.
     This  consists  merely of subtracting the fixed protocol overhead
     (the intercept) from each datum,  and then dividing by the number
     of  sectors which were transferred.  The resulting numbers should
     cluster around the calculated value for the  per-sector  transfer
     time (the slope).  The following values are obtained:

                Transfer time per sector (normalized) in seconds

                Sectors      SEAlink        Zmodem

                 100         0.136393       0.135167

                 500         0.138779       0.140833

                 700         0.138913       0.139138
                 800         0.138574       0.138146
                 900         0.138621       0.137807

                2000         0.138615       0.140473
                3000         0.138640       0.138819

         Mean                0.138483       0.138964
         Standard deviation  0.000717       0.001794
         Standard error      0.52%          1.29%


     As can be seen,  the data  set  is  both  consistent  and  highly
     FidoNews 5-19                Page 10                   9 May 1988


     linear,  and  does  in  fact cluster around the calculated slope,
     thus confirming both the data  set  and  the  validity  of  using
     linear  regression  in  this  case.  The  greater variance of the
     Zmodem data set may be attributed to the greater  complexity  and
     variability of the protocol itself.

     With all of this in mind,  we calculate that our end results  are
     accurate to one decimal place for the intercept,  and two decimal
     places for the  slope,  thus  rendering  the  above  formulae  as
     follows:

                Transfer time for N sectors at 9600 baud, in seconds

                SEAlink      0.14 N + 4.4

                Zmodem       0.14 N + 5.2



     In  a trial such as this the fixed protocol overhead includes the
     time required to load the protocol driver,  and hence may not  be
     representative  of  the  actual  best  possible  fixed   protocol
     overhead.  Regardless,  unless  there  is some wild divergence in
     fixed overhead (which there is not),  then it  may  generally  be
     regarded as negligible, and may hence be ignored.

     This leaves the running per-sector transfer time (the  slope)  as
     the  only  significant  factor in comparing protocol speeds.  Our
     tests  show  no  measurable  difference  in  running   per-sector
     transfer time between Zmodem and SEAlink/Overdrive to within  one
     second per hundred blocks, so we thus conclude that raw thoughput
     speed  cannot  be a deciding factor when choosing between the two
     protocols.

     This still leaves a number of other factors on which one may base
     a  choice.  For  example,  most Zmodem implementations include an
     ability to resume an  interrupted  transfer,  while  the  Dutchie
     restartable  SEAlink  variant is not yet widely supported.  Also,
     Zmodem  is  capable  of  character  quoting  for  packet-switched
     networks  (such as Tymnet) which do not yet support a transparent
     binary mode.  On the other hand,  SEAlink is  less  complex  than
     Zmodem and requires less  code  space  (approximately  5k  versus
     12k),  and includes the inherent ability to  do  XMODEM  and  its
     popular variants such as Modem7 or Telink.  All of these and more
     are  factors  which  the  software  developer  must consider when
     selecting a long-term strategy.

                        New Features for SCOREKEEPER

        Version 3.00 of SCOREKEEPER, a program to let you keep a
     running scoreboard of online game results on your system, has now
     been released.

        The major new feature added is an ability to purge the score
     file of users who are no longer in your user file.  Most sysops
     regularly remove inactive users from the user records, but under
     earlier SCOREKEEPER versions, these "deadwood" users remained
     cluttering up the score file.  Now, a feature has been added to
     let SCOREKEEPR purge records in the score file that don't
     correspond to any current user.

        The latest version of SCOREKEEPER is downloadable and file-
     requestable on node 1:380/2 at (318) 222-3503, in the file
     SCOREKPR.ARC.  Some online games that work with SCOREKEEPER are
     in the files SECRETWD.ARC, NUMBERS.ARC, WINNER.ARC, BLAKJACK.ARC,
     and PLANET.ARC.  An online political survey (which doesn't have
     anything to do with SCOREKEEPER but is another interesting thing
     to have in your Outside section) is in the file POLIPREF.ARC.

        SCOREKEEPER works with Fido, Opus, and any compatible BBS
     which uses the standard Fido user file format and has an ability
     to exit to an "Outside" section to run other programs.

                          Fido 12 Utilities

           The  following  is  the  documentation  for  eleven  (11)
     utilities  I  have written for use with Fido Version 12.  I had
     previously  published  them  and  distributed  through the Fido
     backbone  when Jerry Hindle was the Net Host of 123.  He passed
     these   through   to  Finland  even.   Each  bore  a  statement
     requesting  a  $10.00 contribution, or requiring it in the case
     of a commercial user.

           After  six  (6)  months of waiting, not one thin dime has
     ever  been received in return for these efforts from anyone.  I
     have  therefore  withdrawn  these from general distribution and
     now  will  send  them  from  here  by mail (or file attach if a
     speedier  method  is needed).  Send indicated price ** AND ** a
     self-addressed,  stamped,  return  disk-mailer with a formatted
     disk  enclosed.   Phone  orders accepted with VISA, MASTERCARD,
     AMERICAN EXPRESS and DISCOVER.  Pricing for Fido Sysops is:

     1   Utility    $  10.00
     2   Utilities  $  19.00      Formulae is 1 for $10 and each
     3   Utilities  $  28.00      additional utility for $1 less.
     4   Utilities  $  37.00
     5   Utilities  $  46.00      Net effect is buy 10 and get 11.
     6   Utilities  $  55.00
     7   Utilities  $  64.00
     8   Utilities  $  73.00
     9   Utilities  $  82.00
     10  Utilties   $  91.00
     11  Utilities  $ 100.00

     Phone orders add $3 for disk, mailer and postage.



           I  hope  that  by publishing this information in FidoNews
     that  these  utilities  may  get wider use by legitimate users.
     Such  utilities  and  other  ditties  as  I write will NEVER be
     released as shareware, freeware or in the Public Domain again.

                                         DFC.EXE

           The   DFC  program  is  used  to  detect files that exist
     in  a  directory   but  are  not  shown in FILES.BBS, and vice-
     versa.   An   advantage  of this program over previous versions
     by   other   authors    is   that   this   one   can  handle  a
     directory/FILES.BBS  of  up  to  500  files.  It was written in
     a  machine  with  640k  in it and has NOT been tested with less
     memory at this writing.

           Output   is   to  the  printer.   As  with  all STEWTILS,
     it  is  totally  non-destructive.     Neither   the   DIRectory
     nor FILES.BBS is changed in any way.



                                         FTR.EXE

           I   wrote   the   File   Transfer   Reporter to encourage
     users  to  upload   by  giving  them  credit  for doing so.  It
     requires  that  the   file  named  FIDO.LOG be available in the
     same  directory  that FTR.EXE is in.  Output is to a file named
     FTR.OUT.

           FTR   is   totally  NON-DESTRUCTIVE.   That  is,  it only
     reads FIDO.LOG and does not make any changes to it whatsoever.

           FTR   creates   a   file   named   FTR.OUT that lists who
     uploaded  what   files  (and  where,  by  path), and also shows
     HOW  MANY  files   were downloaded in the same period, and also
     shows  the total number of calls received by the system in that
     period.

              Example output:

              [File [T]ransfer [R]eport, 11-08-87

              Uploads:

              John Doe sent SCIFI\TREK.CON

              There were 11 files downloaded.

              The system received 38 calls.

           In   that period means the dates FIDO.LOG covers.  If you
     only  run   FTR   once   a   week   then  it will list a week's
     worth   of  information.  If  run  daily  it  will  show  daily
     information.

            My   system   changes  FTR.OUT  each  day  and copies it
     to  the  system   file   named WELCOME2.BBS so that each caller
     sees it.  Here is a portion of the batch file showing its use:
              ....
              ....
              FTR
              COPY FTR.OUT WELCOME2.BBS
              ERASE FTR.OUT
              ....
              ....

           This   portion   of   a   batch   file  is executed by an
     external event each night after mail time.



                                         LUG.EXE

           Several   external   programs  require  the presence of a
     version   11   type   file  named  LASTUSER.BBS.   Of  critical
     importance  in  this  file  are  the users name, city, password
     and  privilege  level.  Output of this file contains ONLY those
     items,  and is not  identical to the original.  Ron Bemis OUTER
     requires  it,  for   example,   and   the   output   of  LUG is
     sufficient to fill that need.

           LUG  requires  two files to be in the same directory with
     it.   One  is FIDO.LOG and the other is CALLER.SYS and LUG will
     not operate without both files present.

           Here is an example of the use of LUG in my batch file:

              ....
              ....
              LUG

           The  Master  Sysop Utility gives you TOTAL control of the
     user  log.   Every  single  bit  is open to manipulation by the
     Sysop  for  every user.  Documentation for MSU is included with
     that file, usually seen separate from the STEWTILS.

           A  few of the routines MSU allows are special in that you
     won't  find  them elsewhere that I know of.  A user log SORT is
     included  that  can  sort  the  log  by  privilege  first,  and
     alphabetical  order within privilege.  PURGEing bad log entries
     and  so  forth  is also supported.  SEARCH can be done by name,
     city  or  password.   It  is  as complete as I know since every
     possible change to a log entry is allowed.

           The  current  version  of MSU is 1.01 as of this writing.
     IMPORTANT  NOTE:   MSU.EXE  IS  DESTRUCTIVE!   It  makes actual
     changes to the log itself.



                                         NFU.EXE

           It   is often mentioned in Sysop messages that users wish
     they  didn't   have   to   scan   the  entire FILES.BBS list in
     order  to  see   what   has   come  in  recently.  This program
     creates  a  new  file   containing  ONLY  those  files.   There
     are three pre-conditions:

           1)     FILES.BBS  absolutely,  positively,  unequivocally
     and  without   doubt   MUST   contain  a  line  that says " New
     files  uploaded".    It  may  say  more  than that, but it must
     begin with that.  I call this a statement.

           2)  The statement must begin with a space.

           3)  Upper/lower case useage MUST be exactly as shown.

           The   statement   separates  older files from newer ones.
     Thus in my FILES.BBS it shows:

              ...
              ...
              SOMEFILE.TXT This is a file in the older list

              New files uploaded since October 10, 1987

              ANOTHER.FIL This is a file that has come in recently
              YETANOTH.ER And yet another file recently received

           NFU   will   create  a  file named NEWFILES.LST that will
     contain  ANOTHER.FIL   and YETANOTH.ER.  Now users can find out
     what  is  new   by   T)yping  the file NEWFILES.LST.  I have my
     batch file execute NFU every night.

           NFU   doesn't   change  FILES.BBS  so  as  new  files are
     added NEWFILES.LST will get bigger and bigger.

           Note   that  my statement also contains the information "
     since  October   10,  1987".   This is permissable, since it is
     AFTER  the  statement and doesn't change it.  NEWFILES.LST will
     show the entire line.





                                         ULS.EXE

           This   program sorts the user log first by privilege, and
     then  by   last   name.    This  gives  your  users with higher
     privilege   levels    quicker    recognition   in   the   logon
     search.   It  also  moves   those   with  the  lowest privilege
     levels  to  the  rear  of  the  log.  The  alphabetic  sort  by
     last   name  is obviously helpful when looking for a particular
     entry.

          ULS  requires  the  presence  of one file named CALLER.SYS
     in  the   same  directory  as ULS.EXE.  It is important for you
     to  note   that   ULS   is   totally   NON-DESTRUCTIVE  to  the
     original   log.     It's    output   is   to   a   file   named
     CALLER.SRT.    The   original  file  CALLER.SYS  is  completely
     unchanged.

          Here is an example of it's use in my batch file:
              ....
              ....
              ULS
              COPY CALLER.SYS CALLER.BAK
              COPY CALLER.SRT CALLER.SYS
              ....
              ....



                            UDP.EXE and UDS.EXE

         These   files dump the user log.  They require the presence
     of  the   file   named   CALLER.SYS  in the same directory that
     they are run.

          Since   both   of  these  files  do  the  same  thing  one
     description  will   serve   for   both.   The  only  difference
     is   that  UDP  outputs  to  the printer and UDS outputs to the
     screen.

          Each   senses   where  a page (or screen) break occurs and
     takes  appropriate   action   to  redraw  the  header.   Output
     to  the  printer   is   continuous  while  output to the screen
     stops each time the screen fills.

          Both   UDP   and   UDS   dump  the  log in the order it is
     written.  Neither   file  does  any sorting of output.  You can
     use ULS to sort the file prior to using UDP or UDS.

                                    UPR.EXE

          The   Userlog   Purge  reporter requires the presence of a
     file  named   CALLER.OLD   which   is  generated by SYSOP or by
     MSGMGR.   The   object   here  is to show you who got axed.  It
     shows  the name,  the privilege level of the user, and the date
     of their last call. Output is to the printer.


          Here is an example of its use in my batch file:

              ....
              ....
              MSGMGR
              UPR
              ERASE CALLER.OLD
              ....
              ....



                                     WUW.EXE

           This  is the newest of the STEWTILS.  With the advent and
     spread  of  virus  programs, trojan horses and tapeworms it has
     become  very  necessary to know the source of every file coming
     into  the  board.   WUW  performs  two  tasks.  First, it gives
     output  similar  to FTR in a file named GIVE.CRT that I suggest
     you  attach  a small header to and copy to WELCOME2.BBS so that
     those  who  upload  get  public  credit for doing so.  GIVE.CRT
     lists  the  user  name  first,  then the filename uploaded, and
     then  the  date  of the upload.  Second, it maintains a growing
     file  listing  ALL  uploaded  files  by filename, then user who
     uploaded  the  file,  then  date  file  was  received.  This is
     appended  to  a  file named UPLOAD.WHO which can then be T)yped
     to see just exactly who sent what and when.

           Should  a  problem file appear it is then simple to trace
     it's  origin  on  the system, either by you privately, or as in
     my  case,  by  any  user.  I put UPLOAD.WHO in my general files
     area  and  listed  it in the FILES.BBS file so that users would
     know it is there and why.

           As  a  point  of  general  information, WUW would work on
     version  11  and  earlier Fido's if the file SYSOP.LOG is first
     renamed to FIDO.LOG.  This is also true of FTR.EXE.



                                     WVF.EXE

          One   change  to  Fido  version  12's  user  log  has been
     the  addition   of   a   flag   to   indicate the log's version
     number.   Any   change   to   that  flag  at  the start of each
     individual  user's   entry   causes   errors  in  Fido's  SYSOP
     and   MSGMGR  programs.    In   SYSOP  this error shows up as a
     FidoNews 5-19                Page 18                   9 May 1988


     message  on  the  top   line  of  the  users  entry  that  says
     WRONG   VERSION  CALLER.SYS  and  so on.  No matter what you do
     to  that  entry,  you  can't  fix  it.   In  MSGMGR the program
     simply   fails  to  complete   it's   processing  of  the  log.
     Unfortunately,  unless  you   are   watching   MSGMGR   process
     you   can't  tell  the error occurred.   It usually shows up as
     repeated attempts to purge a user without success.

          WVF   fixes  any  such  error.  What it does NOT do is fix
     the  log   entry   itself.    Any  damages  done  to  the  user
     name,  address,   password  or attributes remains damaged.  WFU
     serves  ONLY   to   make the record accessable by SYSOP so that
     you  can  complete   the   repair.    Conversely,  it  will not
     change  any  other  information  in the entry.  If the name was
     OK  before,  then it will still be OK.  The flag will simply be
     fixed.

          This   program  outputs a new user log named CALLER.FIX so
     once  again   use  of a STEWTIL is non-destructive.  You should
     first  copy   or   rename   CALLER.SYS  so  that  the  original
     remains  intact.    Once   that  is  done, rename CALLER.FIX to
     CALLER.SYS  so  that  the  SYSOP  program or my MSU program can
     work on the repaired log.

          Printer   output alerts you to the particular record where
     the  error   occured,  as  well  as  the name in the log BEFORE
     the  error.   Since damage to the flag usually damages the name
     as  well   I   show   the intact entry previous to the error to
     help  you   locate   the   problem.   If the previous entry was
     damaged  as   well then WVF will report that it cannot give you
     a valid previous entry name.

          Remember,   WVF  fixes a problem in version identification
     that  may   occur   in   the   log   as  used  with the current
     version  of  Fido   12.    It   does   not   repair   the   log
     itself.   You  must  complete  repairs with SYSOP, MSU or other
     utility.



                                    Conclusion

          No  damage  can  occur  to  any  of  the  files referenced
     by  STEWTILS,   even  should  a  power  failure  occur  in mid-
     execution  since   those   files   are  only  READ FROM and are
     never   written   to,  with  the  sole  exception  of  MSU.EXE.
     Output   is   always  either  to  the  printer,  the  screen or
     another   file   that  you  can  then  manipulate  as you wish.
     Therefore, don't be afraid to experiment with them.

     file definition available on his board.

             +*+*+  FidoCon '88 Special Function Report  +*+*+


     Here in Cincinnati Ohio as a special treat for FidoCon '88
     attendees, on aug 25 1988 8:00 PM EDT The Cincinnati Observatory
     will be open to FidoCon attendees for a special private
     viewing.

     The Observatory has two large refractors. The 12" Fraunhofer was
     dedicated in 1843 and was at the time the largest in the united
     states and the finest in the world.  The lens was made in Munich
     transported to the US mounted and housed Locally using local
     Labor.  The tube is made of polished Walnut and most of the
     hardware is polished brass.

     In 1904 a new building and a new 16" Alvan Clark & Sons was
     installed.  The 12" was then sent to the Alvan Clark shops for
     refurbishing.  Sky&Telescope Jan 1986 gives a brief biography of
     the observatory's founder Ormsby Mitchel.  Burnam's handbook
     mentions the 12" as being one of the first to see a companion to
     Antares in 1845.

     Shuttle busses will be provided by FidoCon '88 and will depart at
     about 7PM from the Drawbridge Inn.  This is just one of the
     events planned for FidoCon '88.

     If you want to find out about registration for FidoCon '88 read
     your FidoNews or contact 1/88.  Space for this excursion is
     limited.  If you want to get on the list for the Thursday 25 AUG
     88 Observatory tour (and viewing if someone brings weather from
     Denver) Just leave me a note.

     1:107/211
                      New Discounts for IFNA Members

     The following two items are available to registered members of
     IFNA (or the IEEE) at substantial discounts:

     1.  The Touchbase Systems WorldPort 2400 Portable Modem

         This modem comes with both an AC adapter and a 9-volt battery
         which will power it for approximately six hours.  Roughly the
         size of a package of cigarettes, this engineering marvel
         supports the extended Hayes AT command set and is compatible
         with Bell 103/212A and CCITT V.21/V.22/V.22bis.  It has a
         built in speaker, four call monitoring LEDs, special acoustic
         coupler adapter cable, 25-pin female DB-25 connector, and a
         standard RJ-11C modular connector telephone line interface.
         It has substituted for a Hayes 2400 on this BBS with no
         changes or problems.  Bundled in this offer is CARBON COPY
         PLUS version 4.0 which provides both a terminal emulator
         program and a Remote PC Operation capabilty in the same
         package.  GREAT for lap-tops!

         List price for this modem is $395 (CARBON COPY lists for $195
         alone).  Both are available to IFNA members for $216 plus any
         applicable taxes and shipping charge.


     2.  The CAT Image Scanner Model SI

         This scanner package was a hit at the recent Computer
         Graphics Show in New York City.  It attaches to your printer
         and is driven by the print mechanism to capture 50 to 300 dpi
         images in either Line Art or Half-tone modes.  Scanned images
         can be cropped, scaled, printed, or combined to make posters,
         T-shirts, or viewgraphs.  Captured images can be converted
         into PCX, TIFF or PFF print formats for use by various
         graphic packages or you can do your own desktop publishing
         with any word processor package.  Listing for $195, this item
         is available to IFNA members for $126, plus shipping/taxes.

         Printers supported:  Panasonic KX-P1080, 1091, 1092
         Epson MX 80/100, RX 80/100, JX 80, FX 80/100, FX 85/182
         FX 86/286, Fx 86e/286e, EX 800/100, LQ 800/1000

     For more information on these items see pages 52 and 317 of the
     April 26, 1988 edition of PC magazine (the one that reviews 9600
     baud modems) or send a msg with your voice phone number and
     address to 1:107/211.  Supplies are limited, so don't delay!
