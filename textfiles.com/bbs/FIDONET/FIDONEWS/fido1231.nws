    I spent a lovely day listening to blues on our downtown park
today.  A band from Chigago, one from Detpoit, and a local band.
Wonder full music.

    We live in the center of the city, a place of about a
quarter million people, about 100 kilometers out of Toronto.
Met a bunch of neighbours that I had not met before, and they
all ended up back at our place, playing music, drinking beer,
and talking about the net.

    Funny, I kept thinking about how my neighbours are other
people that I know, and converse with.  Borders are such silly
damned things.

Subject: Fidonews viewer
From: Shawn McMahon (1:3806/10)

- Mein Luftkissenfahrzeug ist voller Aale.
- Please direct all replies to Shawn McMahon at 1:3806/10.

I've just obtained a public domain program that should end the
Fidonews content controversy once and for all, assuming that
those who don't like it are actually offended by the content and
not just trying to exercise control.

It's a Fidonews viewer with a twit filter (won't show you
articles from people you don't like at all) and a word/phrase
filter. (Nuke them pesky words you don't like.)

The archive includes source code, and a 16-bit "family-mode"
executable that will run under both DOS and OS/2.  It has
configurable colors and etc.

Archive  name is FNEWS.ZIP, and I'll be uploading it to
1:3806/11. He normally lets me make things available for FREQ
through his system, so it should be available by the time you
read this.

It comes pre-set to nuke articles from Bob Germer and Steve
Winter, and to bleep out the obscene words "religion" and
"politics." <g>

These settings are completely configurable.

DEF CON III Last Minute changes.

This is the last update before the convention at the Tropicana this
August 4-6th.  If you can't find it in this or the main last announcement
(Version 1.80) then it isn't mentioned and you need to email me (dtangent@
defcon.org)

SPEAKERS:
These are the speakers currently listed.  If they are not listed here
but were in the 1.80 announcement it means they have dropped or I can't
get ahold of them and assume they are not showing up.

Bruce Schenier           Winn Schwartau           Chris Hall
Theora                   Curtis Karnow            Robert D. Steele
James Settle             Karen Coyle              Peter J. Skelly

WEB PAGE:
Is working now at http://www.defcon.org/ and announcements and stuff
will be posted there.  But you don't care because you'll be at the con and
it won't make a difference.

BAR:
I got a wet bar again for the convention area (Nobody better fucking
break it this year or I will sick _all_ the Goons (c) on you and you'll
be screwed) and it starts around 10 pm on Friday night to get us liquored
up in time for hacker jeopardy.  If it survives we'll have it again Saturday.

NETWORK:
Don't forget to bring your stuff for the 10baseT ethernet network.
Get the winsock tcp/ip stack installed in advance if you can.

MOVIES:
Bring a vcr if you want to dub anything people are offering, bring the
movies you want to show.
