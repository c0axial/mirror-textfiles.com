                         A Christmas Poem
                         ----------------

     Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the shop,
     The computers were whirring; they never do stop.
     The power was on and the temperature right,
     In hopes that the input would feed back that night.

     The system was ready, the program was coded,
     And memory drums had been carefully loaded;
     While adding a Christmasy glow to the scene,
     The lights on the console flashed red, white, and green.

     When out in the hall there arose such a clatter,
     The programmer ran out to see what was the matter.
     Away to the hallway he flew like a flash,
     Forgetting his key in his curious dash.

     He stood in the hallway and looked all about,
     When the door slammed behind him,and he was locked out.
     Then, in the computer room, what should appear,
     But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer;
     And a little old man, who with scarcely a pause, Chuckled:
     "My name is Santa... the last name is Claus."

     The computer was startled, confused by the name,
     Then it buzzed as it heard the old fellow exclaim:
     "This is Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen,
     And Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen."

     With all these odd names, it was puzzled anew;
     It hummed and it clanked, and a main ciruit blew.
     It searched in its memory core, trying to "think";
     Then the multi-line printer went out on the blink.

     Unable to do its electronic job,
     It said in a voice that was almost a sob:
     "Your eyes--how they twinkle--your dimples so merry,
     Your cheeks so like roses, your nose like a cherry,
     Your smile--all these things, I've been programmed to know,
     And at data-recall, I am more than so-so;
     But your name and your address (computers can't lie),
     Are things that I just cannot identify.

     You've a jolly old face and a little round belly,
     That shakes when you laugh like a bowlful of jelly;
     My scanners can see you, but still I insist,
     Since you're not in my program, you cannot exist!'
     FidoNews 6-51                Page 2                   18 Dec 1989


     Old Santa just chuckled a merry "ho,ho,"
     And sat down to type out a quick word or so.
     The keyboard clack-clattered, its sound sharp and clean,
     As Santa fed this "data" into the machine:
     "Kids everywhere know me; I come every year;
     The presents I bring add to everyone's cheer;
     But you won't get a thing-- that's plain to see;
     Too bad your programmers forgot about me."

     Then he faced the machine and said with a shrug,
     "Happy Christmas to all," as he pulled out its plug.

                THE NIGHT BEFORE BETA TEST

       'Twas the night before beta test, and all through the house,
       not a program was working not even a browse.
       The programmers hung by their tubes in despair,
       with hopes that a miracle soon would be there.
       The users were nestled all snug in their beds,
       while visions of inquiries danced in their heads.
       When out in the machine room there arose such a clatter,
       I sprang from my desk to see what was the matter.
       And, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
       but a super-programmer (with a six-pack of beer.)
       His resume glowed with experience so rare,
       he turned out great code with a bit-pusher flair.
       More rapid than eagles, his programs they came,
       and he cursed and muttered and called them by name:
       On update  On add  On inquiry  On delete
       On batch jobs  On closing  On functions complete.
       His eyes were glazed over, fingers nimble and lean,
       from weekends and nights in front of a screen.
       A wink of his eye, and a twitch of his head,
       soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.
       He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
       turning specs into code, and then turned with a jerk.
       And laying his finger upon the "ENTER" key,
       he brought it all up and it worked perfectly.
       The updates updated; the deletes, they deleted;
       the inquiries inquired; and the closings completed.
       He tested each whistle, he tested each bell,
       with nary an a bug, all had gone well.
       The system was finished, the tests were concluded,
       the users' last changes were even included.
       Yet the users exclaimed with a snarl and a taunt,
       "It's just what we asked for but NOT what we want."

     Introduction
     ============

          I expect that many in FidoNet will view  the  draft  of  the
     Internetwork Gateway Policy document published in this issue with
     some  puzzlement.   Some  will  not  have  more  than  a  cursory
     awareness  that  Other  Networks   even   exist.   Others   will,
     initially,  not understand why the current tendency of most other
     FidoNet Technology Networks (FTNs) to "grab a  zone  and  go"  is
     causing technical and administrative difficulties within FidoNet.
     Many  may  be  under  the  quite mistaken impression that FidoNet
     somehow sanctions or assigns zone numbers to other FTN  networks.
     Very  few  will be aware that FidoNet currently exchanges net and
     echomail traffic with networks whose  technology  and  addressing
     scheme  is  not  that  of  FidoNet.  Most  folks,  quite rightly,
     believe in the old maxim:  "If it ain't broke,  don't fix it." In
     this article, I will try to explain why most current internetwork
     communication  methods  are  broken  and  why  we  feel that this
     document will at least lay  the  groundwork  for  correcting  the
     problems that currently exist.


     Why Zones Don't Work
     --------------------
          Those who designed the addressing scheme used within FidoNet
     intended  that  zones be used to denote large geographic areas of
     the world.  The zonegate  concept  was  developed  to  facilitate
     economical and flexible interzone communication.

          Zonegates   provide   economy   by  concentrating  interzone
     messages at the zonegate;  allowing many messages to be  combined
     and compressed before they make the expensive "jump" to the other
     zone.

          Zonegates provide addressing flexibility by allowing net and
     node  numbers  to  be duplicated across zones.  For example,  all
     FidoNet zones may contain a net  123  or  a  node  123/456.  This
     allows  each  zone coordinator a substantial amount of freedom in
     how they set up the zone's addressing scheme.

          Zonegate technology specifically does not, however,  provide
     the  functionality  necessary  to run a proper network to network
     gateway.  The inherent design assumes too much.  It assumes  that
     the zonegate's FidoNet address will be something that it will not
     be  in  the  case of a network gateway.  It assumes that there is
     only one "zone" for any given zone number.  It assumes  that  the
     "from"  Zone:Net/Node  of the message need not be modified.  None
     of these things may be properly assumed in  the  network  gateway
     scenario.  The  result  of  attempts  to make zonegate technology
     serve in a network gateway role is  that  both  FidoNet  and  the
     other  network are plagued with invalid,  unknown addresses.  The
     problem is compounded when more than one other  network  attempts
     to  use the same illicit zone number.  Private netmail replies to
     FidoNews 6-51                Page 7                   18 Dec 1989


     echomail messages (one of the basic  tenets  of  FidoNet)  become
     impossible.

          The problem is further aggravated when users on a network to
     which  FidoNet  is  properly  gated (UUCP / Internet for example)
     attempt to reply to a message containing  one  of  these  illicit
     zone  numbers.  The  message  arrives  at  the FidoNet / Internet
     gate.  Automatic forwarding from that  point  becomes  impossible
     since  the "to" address is not a valid FidoNet address.  Usually,
     the FidoNet gateway sysop has no idea where to  manually  forward
     the message.


     What Will Work
     --------------
          The  solution  to  this  growing  problem is to require that
     messages, while in FidoNet, contain only valid FidoNet addresses.
     Period.  A proper gateway will make all messages  emanating  from
     it into FidoNet appear technically as if they originated from the
     gate's  FidoNet  address just as if a user on that FidoNet system
     had entered the message.  If an "other  network"  address  is  to
     appear  in  the message,  it must appear elsewhere (in a location
     not relied upon by FidoNet mailer software for routing, duplicate
     checking,  etc.),  such  as  in  the  message  body.   With  that
     accomplished,  the  technical  problems  disappear  with the sole
     exception being the education of the users in both networks as to
     how and where to place the other network's address before sending
     the  message  to  the  gate.   Several   techniques   have   been
     considered.

          The  imposition  of a standard method is beyond the scope of
     this group's mandate.  That will be left to  the  FTSC,  and  the
     software  developers.  It  is  our  sincere  hope that a standard
     method will be put forth in the  near  future.  Otherwise,  users
     will  have  to  remember  multiple  methods of gateway addressing
     depending upon which network the message is  ultimately  destined
     for.


     Administrative Objectives
     -------------------------
          Another  problem  with  the  "grab  a zone and go" method of
     internetwork   connectivity   arises   when   the   question   of
     accountability   arises.   Who   is   this  other  network  whose
     zone:net/node addresses are now appearing in FidoNet echoes?  Who
     does FidoNet contact  in  the  event  that  technical  or  policy
     related  problems  occur?  Who  does an echo moderator contact to
     resolve a problem with an unruly user in the other net?  Who does
     a  FidoNet  coordinator  contact  in  the  event  that  a  policy
     complaint  is  filed  upon  a user or sysop in the other net?  In
     most cases for most networks the  current  answer  to  the  above
     questions is "I don't know."

     FidoNews 6-51                Page 8                   18 Dec 1989


          We submit that this is no way to run a railroad.  It is this
     series   of  problems  that  the  "Administrative  Agreement  and
     Registration" portion of the Gateway document  was  developed  to
     address.  Some  person in the other net needs to come forward and
     say "Me.  I'm the guy (or gal).  Here's my address  and  voice  /
     data phone numbers.  If you have problems with or questions about
     this network or its gateways,  FidoNet,  call me.  I'll take care
     of it.  By the way, here are the names and numbers of a few other
     highly placed persons in this net.  If you can't reach  me,  call
     them.  They  will  be  able  to assist you too." On its part,  we
     propose  that  FidoNet  create  the  position   of   Internetwork
     Coordinator  to  provide just that service to other nets that may
     have problems with or questions of FidoNet.

          The question of accountability can be simply  and  elegantly
     addressed  if  we simply choose to view each "other network" as a
     large "point" network  under  the  control  of  the  "responsible
     party"  named  in  the  administrative  agreement  with the other
     network.  Just as the "bossnode" is responsible for  the  actions
     of  his  "point" systems,  the "responsible party" is responsible
     for the actions of the sysops and users in the other network with
     respect to FidoNet policy compliance.

          In the event  of  a  problem,  FidoNet  can  work  with  the
     "responsible  party"  or  their  authorized  agent to resolve the
     matter.  If the matter cannot be resolved in any  other  fashion,
     FidoNet  reserves  the  right to simply cease gateway activities.
     FidoNet makes no attempt to dictate  what  policy  users  in  any
     other network adopt or operate under.  It simply requires that if
     a  message is to travel into FidoNet,  it will be measured by the
     same policy yardstick as any other FidoNet message or it will not
     travel here at all.


     Summary
     -------

          Your comments are invited.  Many individuals have spent many
     months in the development and refinement of  the  draft  you  see
     here.  In that situation, we may have taken for granted something
     that  the  wording  of the document really doesn't make clear.  A
     policy is  nothing  unless  it  can  be  clearly  understood  and
     applied.  If something seems unclear or ambiguous, please call it
     to  our  attention.  It is our intention to allow 30 days for the
     receipt of input from the  network  at  large.  After  that,  the
     final  draft  will  be presented to the International Coordinator
     for adoption.  When that occurs,  an article containing the final

     Section 1 - Purpose
     ===================

          This  document  sets   forth   the   administrative   policy
     requirements  for  interconnection  between  the  FidoNet amateur
     international electronic mail network and other  electronic  mail
     networks.

          As  an  amateur  network,  membership in FidoNet is open and
     available to any individual  or  group  capable  of  meeting  the
     technical  challenge  and  willing  to participate constructively
     within  the  technical  and  administrative  guidelines  employed
     within  FidoNet.  FidoNet desires to extend this idea,  "The free
     exchange  of  information,"  to  include  other  electronic  mail
     networks.   While   connectivity   with  other  networks  can  be
     beneficial to all parties involved,  it  cannot  be  expected  to
     operate smoothly unless the parties involved understand and agree
     to  observe  technical  and administrative guidelines designed to
     promote the orderly flow  of  traffic  between  networks  and  to
     provide a mechanism for problem resolution should problems arise.
     This document intends to address those points.


     Section 2 - Definitions
     =======================


     "FidoNet"
     ---------
          An  amateur  electronic mail wide area network consisting of
     several thousand computer  systems  world  wide.  Most  of  these
     systems  operate  electronic bulletin board (BBS) software giving
     each system the capability to provide electronic mail services to
     up  to  several  hundred  users.   Detailed  information  on  the
     technical  and organizational aspects of the FidoNet mail network
     is beyond the scope of this document.  Further information can be
     obtained from various FidoNet publications including the  FidoNet
     official policy document.

     FidoNews 6-51                Page 10                  18 Dec 1989


     "Other Network"
     ---------------
          The  term "Other Network" will be used in this document as a
     shorthand term referring to any other  electronic  mail  network,
     whether inherently compatible with the technology employed within
     FidoNet   or  not.   This  term  will  often  be  used  to  refer
     specifically to the electronic mail network making application to
     FidoNet for a "Gateway" (defined below).


     "Gateway"
     ---------
           A gateway is  a  system  of  computers  equipped  with  the
     hardware  and software necessary to pass electronic mail messages
     (possibly of various types,  see below)  between  FidoNet  and  a
     specific Other Network.  A Gateway acts as a translator, allowing
     messages  entered  on a system in the Other Network and addressed
     to a destination within FidoNet to be translated into a form that
     is technically acceptable to and compatible with FidoNet and vice
     versa.   All  messages  originated  in  the  Other  Network   and
     addressed  to  a destination within FidoNet are first routed to a
     Gateway.

           At a Gateway, the message is made technically acceptable to
     and compatible with FidoNet and  forwarded  into  FidoNet's  wide
     area  network  for  delivery to its final destination.  A message
     originated within FidoNet and addressed to a  destination  within
     the Other Network is handled in a similar manner.


     "Netmail"
     ---------
          The  term  Netmail,  as  used  within FidoNet,  refers to an
     electronic mail message that is addressed to a specific  physical
     destination.  Netmail  messages  can be addressed to a particular
     individual at the destination site.  Public messages can be  read
     by  users  other  than the named addressee while private messages
     cannot typically be  read  by  any  user  other  than  the  named
     addressee   and   the   system   administrator/operator   at  the
     destination site.  Further information on Netmail is available in
     other FidoNet technical and policy documents.


     "Conference Mail"
     -----------------
          Echomail is  the  term  used  within  FidoNet  to  refer  to
     electronic  "Conference  Mail"  messages  that,   while  possibly
     containing the name of  a  particular  individual  in  the  "To:"
     field,  are  copied and distributed to multiple (possibly several
     hundred) destination systems.  Some Other Networks refer to their
     analogous capability under the terms "GroupMail" or  "newsgroup".
     Echomail  messages  are  segregated into "Conferences" based upon
     the topic being discussed.  Echomail message content  is  usually
     restricted  to  the  topic(s) for which the particular conference
     was created.  Several hundred Echomail conferences  exist  within
     FidoNet dedicated to topics ranging from technical discussions of
     FidoNews 6-51                Page 11                  18 Dec 1989


     various  computer  systems  and  peripherals  to  philosophy  and
     religion.  Further information on Echomail  can  be  obtained  by
     consulting other FidoNet technical and policy documents.


     "FidoNet Technology Network" (FTN)
     ----------------------------------
           For  the  purposes of this document,  a "FidoNet Technology
     Network" (FTN) shall be defined as an Other Network whose message
     format and transmission protocols  strictly  meet  the  technical
     requirements   set  forth  by  the  FidoNet  Technical  Standards
     Committee (FTSC).  FidoNet  Technology  Networks  are  inherently
     technically  compatible  with  FidoNet.  Connectivity options are
     available to FTN's that are not (for technical reasons) available
     to non-FTN Other Networks.


     Internetwork Coordinator (INC)
     ------------------------------
          The  Internetwork  Coordinator  is  the  individual   within
     FidoNet  who  has the responsibility for overseeing the granting,
     installation,   and  maintenance  of  FidoNet  to  Other  Network
     Gateways.  The INC shall be designated by and act as the agent of
     the FidoNet International Coordinator.


     Multi-Network (MultiNet)
     ------------------------
          A  "multinet" is a type of "super" network whose function is
     to provide connectivity between many other networks and to  allow
     bidirectional communication between these networks.


     Duplicate Message
     -----------------
          Because  of  the  technology  employed   by   some   FidoNet
     Conference   Mail   distribution   systems,    improper   routing
     information or topology can cause multiple  copies  of  the  same
     message  text  to  be  delivered to FidoNet systems.  A duplicate
     message is defined as any message  arriving  at  a  FidoNet  node
     whose  message  body (the text entered by the human originator of
     the message) is identical to the message  body  of  a  previously
     received   message.   Messages   manually  forwarded  to  another
     recipient are not considered duplicates for the purposes of  this
     document.


     Section 3 - Administrative Guidelines
     =====================================

          This section  is  intended  to  outline  the  administrative
     framework  under  which  Other  Networks  may connect to FidoNet.
     FidoNet reserves the right to reject any  Other  Network  Gateway
     application for any reason.

     FidoNews 6-51                Page 12                  18 Dec 1989


     3.1 - Other Network Connectivity to FidoNet Through "MultiNets"
     ---------------------------------------------------------------
          FidoNet may elect to seek and obtain connectivity to various
     multinet host facilities for the purposes of communicating with a
     wide  range of Other Networks.  Any Other Network that desires to
     communicate  with  FidoNet   may   elect   to   facilitate   such
     communication  via  the multinet.  However,  FidoNet reserves the
     right to refuse to deliver incoming message traffic arriving  via
     such  an  arrangement based upon the guidelines set forth in this
     document.


     An Example:

          FidoNet is now gated into Internet via UUCP.  It has  agreed
     to  the  terms  and  conditions  necessary  for membership in and
     connectivity  to  the  Internet  multi-network  "umbrella".   One
     obvious method for achieving connectivity to FidoNet (and a whole
     host  of  other  wide  area networks) is for the Other Network to
     apply to Internet for a gateway.  Under this scenario,  the Other
     Network  is bound by the terms and conditions of Internet just as
     FidoNet is.  In this peer relationship,  the terms and conditions
     stated in this document are used by FidoNet to determine if Other
     Network  message  traffic  arriving at a FidoNet/Internet gateway
     will be accepted into FidoNet.



     3.2 - Connectivity Only Through Mutually Recognized Gateways
     ------------------------------------------------------------
          While FidoNet has no desire to  inhibit  experimentation  or
     connectivity  between  consenting  systems  it  must maintain the
     technical  and   administrative   integrity   of   its   network.
     Henceforth,  FidoNet  will  not  permit  non-FidoNet addresses to
     appear in any addressing or routing control fields (Some  current
     examples  include:  the  "From"  or  "To" address fields,  the "*
     Origin" lines, the "seen-by" fields, and the "^APath" fields.) of
     any netmail or echomail messages  traveling  on  any  portion  of
     FidoNet's  wide  area  network.  This  restriction applies to all
     present and future FidoNet  nodes.  FidoNet  nodes  who  wish  to
     participate  in Other Networks may do so but must insure that all
     message traffic transmitted to other FidoNet systems contain only
     valid FidoNet addresses in the  addressing  and  routing  control
     fields.  The  FidoNet  coordinators will enforce this requirement
     and are authorized  by  the  International  Coordinator  to  take
     whatever action may be necessary to prevent non-FidoNet addresses
     from  entering Fidonet,  including without limitation,  referring
     the offending nodes to this  document  and  to  the  InterNetwork
     Coordinator  for information on how to establish proper Gateways.
     The sole exception to  this  requirement  is  set  forth  in  the
     following paragraph:

     FidoNews 6-51                Page 13                  18 Dec 1989


          The exchange of  message  traffic,  on  an  experimental  or
     private  and  closely controlled basis,  between an Other Network
     and a system or systems that happen to be members of  FidoNet  is
     permitted  and  encouraged if such message traffic is confined to
     the consenting FidoNet systems and is not allowed to travel on or
     to any portion of  FidoNet's  wide  area  network  that  has  not
     previously   consented   to   carry  such  traffic  and  if  such
     connectivity  does  not  prohibit  the  FidoNet  system(s)   from
     fulfilling  the  technical  and policy requirements necessary for
     membership in FidoNet.  FidoNet requests that the INC be informed
     of such arrangements so that any unintentional "leakage" of Other
     Network message traffic into FidoNet's wide area network  may  be
     rapidly isolated and corrected.

          The  exchange  of  message traffic between any Other Network
     and FidoNet on any basis other than  the  one  mentioned  in  the
     paragraph  above  shall  only be done through mutually recognized
     and proper Gateways meeting the requirements set  forth  in  this
     document.


     3.3 - Administrative Agreement and Registration
     -----------------------------------------------
          FidoNet  requires  that  an  Administrative   agreement   be
     executed  by  and  between  the individual(s) responsible for the
     administration of the Other Network and the FidoNet International
     Coordinator, or the IC's authorized agent.  This agreement should
     outline, at a minimum, the following items:

          1 -  The name of the organization.

          2  - The  name,  address, and  voice  telephone  number
               where the  administrator of the Other Network  may
               be reached. (Administrative contact and  responsi-
               ble party).

          3 -  A brief description of the organization.

          4  - The name, address and voice telephone number where
               the individual(s) responsible for the operation of
               the   FidoNet/Other  Network  Gateway(s)  may   be
               reached. (Technical Contact(s))

          5  - A  list of computer system(s)  requesting  Gateway
               status  containing the following information:

               o    The  name  of the gateway system as  it  will
                    appear in the  FidoNet nodelist.

               o    The Locality, State / Province / Department /
                    etc.,  and  Country   where  the  Gateway  is
     FidoNews 6-51                Page 14                  18 Dec 1989


                    physically located.

               o    The name of the system administrator for  the
                    particular Gateway.

               o    The  complete data telephone number  for  the
                    Gateway, including country code.

               o    The maximum baud rate supported by the  Gate-
                    way and all modem standards supported.

               o    The  hours  during  which  the  Gateway  will
                    support FidoNet dial up mail sessions.  (*SEE
                    NOTE BELOW*)

               o    The  date the Gateway is expected  to  become
                    operational.

               o    The  FidoNet compatible  session  protocol(s)
                    supported

               o    If  the Gateway is now a member  of  FidoNet,
                    the zone, net, and node number of the FidoNet
                    system applying for Gateway status.


              NOTE: For a system to be granted Gateway status, it
                    must  at least be available for FidoNet  dial
                    up mail sessions during the FidoNet dedicated
                    mail  period  for  the  geographic   locality
                    concerned.    FidoNet  calls  its   mandatory
                    dedicated  mail period the "Zone Mail  Hour".
                    The time for "Zone Mail Hour" varies through-
                    out the world and can be found in Appendix  A
                    of the current FidoNet Policy Document.

          6.   A  clearly  worded statement indicating  that  the
               responsible  party in the Other Network and  Fido-
               Net agree to the terms and conditions set forth in
               the  Administrative  Agreement and those  in  this
               document  (included by reference as a part of  the
               agreement).

     3.4 - Application of FidoNet Administrative Policy
     --------------------------------------------------
          For  the  purposes of applying FidoNet policy,  FidoNet will
     view the entire Other Network as a single  FidoNet  "node"  under
     the  control  of  the  individual  named  as  the "Administrative
     Contact / Responsible Party" (or an authorized agent thereof)  in
     the  administrative  agreement  outlined  in paragraph 3.3 above.
     All other systems and their users will be viewed  by  FidoNet  as
     users  on  the  "responsible  party's"  node  for the purposes of
     FidoNet official policy application.

     FidoNews 6-51                Page 15                  18 Dec 1989


          FidoNet holds the operator of  a  FidoNet  node  responsible
     (from  an  administrative  policy  standpoint) for the actions of
     that node's users,  subordinate "point" systems,  and the "point"
     system's  users.  FidoNet  views single or multiple Other Network
     Gateways as a  single  "boss"  node  under  the  control  of  the
     "responsible  party"  and  will  apply  FidoNet  official  policy
     accordingly.  FidoNet reserves the right to sever links to one or
     more of the Other Network's Gateways  as  its  final  remedy  for
     violations  of  administrative policy.  (see the paragraph titled
     "Points" in the  "Overview"  section  and  the  paragraph  titled
     "Responsible  for  All  Traffic Entering FidoNet Via the Node" in
     the "Sysop  Procedures"  section  of  FidoNet's  official  policy
     document, for further information).


     3.5 - Supported Message Types
     -----------------------------
          FidoNet  will grant Gateway interconnection for the purposes
     of exchanging messages of the type defined above as "Netmail" and
     optionally for the purposes of exchanging messages  of  the  type
     defined  above  as  "Echomail".  FidoNet  will  not grant Gateway
     interconnection for the purposes of exchanging  "Echomail"  only.
     The ability to generate a private and personal "Netmail" reply to
     an  "Echomail"  message is one of the basic facets of FidoNet and
     cannot be compromised.


     3.6 - Acceptance Criteria (All Other Networks)
     ----------------------------------------------
          The granting of Other Network Gateways into FidoNet  is  not
     automatic  nor  is it based solely on the Other Network's ability
     to demonstrate technical compliance with the objectives set forth
     in section 4 below.  Some other criteria include:

          o    The Other Network should have an individual  will-
               ing and able to carry out the role of "Responsible
               Party"  as  defined  herein.  The  Other   Network
               "administration"  should  be willing  to  help  in
               assuring  that technical, social, and  administra-
               tive policy standards are consistently met in  all
               message  traffic  emanating from  the  Gateway(s).
               FidoNet pledges to do likewise.

          o    The Other Network must have demonstrable  stabili-
               ty.   It should have been in operation as  a  free
               standing  network for a period of time  sufficient
               to  prove its reliability.  It should be  able  to
               prove that it has the technical and administrative
               expertise to maintain and regulate reliable  Gate-
               ways over an extended period of time.

     3.7 - Other Criteria (FTN Other Networks)
     -----------------------------------------
          Software  allowing  nodes   in   FTN   Other   Networks   to
     simultaneously  participate  directly in FidoNet as valid FidoNet
     nodes,  isolating the  Other  Network's  addresses  from  FidoNet
     message  traffic  (i.e.,  using  only  valid FidoNet addresses in
     FidoNet message traffic) presently exists.  This "dual  identity"
     approach  is  the  method  FidoNet expects nodes in the FTN Other
     Network will employ.  Such an approach:

          o    Eliminates  the  need for  any  written  agreement
               between  FidoNet and the FTN Other  Network  since
               each  Other  Network node simply  participates  in
               FidoNet, using only valid FidoNet addresses, in  a
               manner indistinguishable from a FidoNet node  that
               does not belong to any Other Network.

          o    Allows for FidoNet connectivity on a node by  node
               basis.

          o    Speeds  mail  transfer since message  traffic  can
               enter FidoNet's wide area network at the point  of
               origin rather than having to first pass through  a
               Gateway.

          o    Eliminates  the  costly situation where  an  Other
               Network node wanting to communicate with a FidoNet
               node  (or  vice versa) in the same  local  calling
               area  must first route the message through a  dis-
               tant  Gateway,  incurring unnecessary  expense  to
               himself, the Other Network and FidoNet.

          o    Gives  each  node contact with  a  nearby  FidoNet
               coordinator  to  provide  FidoNet  services   more
               effectively.

          o    Greatly  reduces  the effort involved  to  connect
               into  FidoNet.  Each node simply sends  a  Netmail
               message to the nearest FidoNet coordinator listing
               the  pertinent  information  for  the  system  and
               requesting that a FidoNet node number be granted.

          o    Eliminates  any  possible  administrative   policy
               conflicts between the FTN Other Network and  Fido-
               Net.  The node simply adheres to FidoNet policy in
               FidoNet  message  traffic  and  to  Other  Network
               policy in Other Network message traffic.

          Given the above  advantages,  the  FTN  Other  Network  must
     provide    evidence    of    overriding   technical   or   social
     considerations,  must show cause why these considerations justify
     the  establishment  of  a  Gateway instead of merely allowing its
     individual nodes to use the "dual identity"  approach,  and  must
     satisfy  FidoNet  that  such  an  arrangement  will  be  mutually
     beneficial.

     3.8 - Shared Echomail Conferences
     ---------------------------------
          Echomail   conferences   shared  between  networks  must  be
     registered with the appropriate FidoNet echomail coordinator.  It
     is the responsibility of  the  Other  Network  and  its  Echomail
     source(s)  within  FidoNet  to  insure  that  proper  topology is
     observed between the FidoNet / Other Network Gateway(s) and  that
     duplicate  echomail  messages do not enter FidoNet.  It cannot be
     overemphasized that all message traffic emanating from a  Gateway
     must  contain  only  valid  FidoNet  addresses  in  the message's
     addressing and routing fields.  Current examples include, without
     limitation,  the "from" and "to" addresses in the message header,
     the  *ORIGIN  line address,  the SEEN BY addresses and the ^APath
     addresses.


     3.9 - Network Integrity
     -----------------------
          In the event that FidoNet determines that  significant  harm
     is  being  caused  to  the  technical  or social integrity of its
     network, it may immediately sever links between the Other Network
     Gateway(s)  and  FidoNet.   FidoNet  will  make  all   reasonable
     attempts  to  contact the "Responsible Party" as soon as possible
     (before the severing of links if possible) to  inform  the  Other
     Network of the problem and to work toward its resolution.


     Section 4 - Technical Objectives
     ================================

          At this time, FidoNet has not published a detailed technical
     standard  for  Gateways.  FidoNet  reserves the right to develop,
     implement,  and require adherence to such a standard at a  future
     date.  In the mean time, the following general guidelines are set
     forth for Other Networks that desire to communicate with FidoNet.


     4.1 - Technical Standards within FidoNet
     ----------------------------------------
          The   FidoNet   Technical  Standards  Committee  (FTSC)  has
     developed and published technical standards for  message  packets
     and  mailer-to-mailer  protocols.  The  Gateway system(s) must be
     able to assemble and transmit FidoNet  standard  message  packets
     using  FidoNet standard session protocol.  A gateway must also be
     able to receive and disassemble FidoNet standard message  packets
     using  FidoNet  standard  session protocol.  Translation from the
     Other Network's  internal  message  format  to  FidoNet  standard
     packets and vice versa is the responsibility of the Gateway.


     4.2 - Logical Other Network Address
     -----------------------------------
     FidoNews 6-51                Page 18                  18 Dec 1989


          Software  at  a  Gateway  shall modify each message entering
     FidoNet (whether Netmail or Echomail) such that FidoNet  software
     will  interpret  the  logical address of origin of the message as
     the Gateway's FidoNet address.


     4.3 - Physical Other Network Address
     ------------------------------------
          Software at a Gateway shall embed the Other Network  address
     (physical  point  of  origin),  in  human  readable  form,  at  a
     predictable location in the message body immediately preceded  by
     a   predictable   identifier   such  that  software  designed  to
     facilitate the automatic inclusion of this information in FidoNet
     replies to Other Network messages will  be  able  to  glean  this
     information  from  the  other  text  in  the  body of the message
     reliably.  This requirement applies  to  Other  Network  messages
     entering FidoNet, both Netmail and Echomail.


     4.4 - FidoNet to Other Network Addressing (Netmail)
     ---------------------------------------------------
          FidoNet  users must be provided with a procedure for routing
     what FidoNet defines as "Netmail" to Other Network  users  via  a
     Gateway.  FidoNet  users will be instructed to address netmail to
     Other Network users to the FidoNet Zone:Net/Node address  for  an
     Other Network Gateway.

          The  exact  method  by which these messages are forwarded to
     their final destination within the Other Network is left  to  the
     discretion  of  the Other Network.  One obvious method is to have
     the FidoNet user enter the "physical Other  Network  address"  in
     the proper location preceded by the proper identifier as outlined
     in  paragraph  4.4 above.  FidoNet will help the Other Network in
     educating FidoNet users on the proper form and  location  of  the
     additional  address  information  necessary to route a FidoNet to
     Other Network message to its final destination automatically  via
     a  Gateway.  FidoNet  netmail arriving at a Gateway with improper
     Other Network addressing information must either be corrected and
     forwarded to the proper Other Network address or returned to  the
     FidoNet  sender  with text inserted notifying the sender that the
     message was undeliverable.


     4.5 - Echomail Standards
     ------------------------
          Echomail entering FidoNet shall conform  to  FidoNet  (FTSC)
     standard  format.   FidoNet  control,   routing,  and  addressing
     information in each message shall show that  it  originated  from
     the  Gateway's  FidoNet  address.  Internal Other Network routing
     information (if  any)  attached  to  echomail  messages  must  be
     removed  at  the  Gateway  with the exception being the "Physical
     Other Network Address" as defined in paragraph 4.3 above.

                  TosScan - THE Echomail processor


     Introduction:
     -------------

     The day many of you have been waiting for, and some thought would
     never come,  has finally arrived.  Yes TosScan, the  most awesome
     echomail processor to ever hit the network, is finally available!

     Let me just say that when one is coding such a full-featured pro-
     gram, and when  the integrity of billons of bytes  of echomail is
     at stake, it's best  to make sure it is right  rather than rush a
     questionable version out the door.

     As part  of the beta  test team, I can  say that TosScan  is rock
     solid and ready to roll.


     What it is
     ----------
     Of course TosScan has all the  usual features you'd expect of any
     echomail toss/scan program, but there is much more!

        o Full-screen, window-based setup/configuration program.
        o Echo Area manager.
        o Node manager.
        o AreaMgr (similiar to AreaFix)
        o Full point support.
        o Full zone support.
        o Message base utilities.

     You'll never have to load your text editor to modify a areas file
     or other control file every time a  node or area is added to your
     system.  And, you  won't have to keep that dog-eared copy of docs
     nearby just to mutter... "Hmmmm, lets  see, what was that command
     line  switch again?"  as  is often  done  with other  processors.

     Tsetup, the  TosScan setup/configuration program, will  make your
     life much easier  whether you are the  last link or a  major NEC.
     All aspects of echomail areas/nodes  and message base maintenance
     are handled according to parameters defined in Tsetup.

     I'd like to describe each individual  feature, but to do so would
     swell FidoNews to unmanageable proportions.

     Flexibility is the keyword. ARCmail  in all flavors, variable net
     node number usage and ARCmail filenaming conventions just to name
     a few.  The list goes on and on, but as I said, there is just too
     much for this article.

     FidoNews 6-51                Page 24                  18 Dec 1989


     Reliability is one of TosScan's strong points.  It can handle the
     worst junk that  programs such as Qecho can throw at it.  TosScan
     processes mangled packets and  grunged archives with unbelievable
     ease;  I  have yet  to  see  it  stumble  over a  single  bundle.

     I hear  you saying "But is it fast?".  Speed, of  course, depends
     on whether you have  a screamer 386 or lowly 8088  with 80ms hard
     drive.  Here's an idea of what you can expect.  Your times may be
     slightly different.

        System: 386/20, 28ms 1:1 drive, Dos 3.30 w/2MB disk cache.
       Arcmail: 710 KB / 1999 messages, 6 down-link systems.
          Time: 21 minutes

        System: 386/20, 2 MB RAM running in page interleave, DOS 4.01,
                28ms hard drive.
       Arcmail: 377 KB *.pkt. About 1/2 of the conferences run in
                passthrough, averaging of 2.5 links per conference.
          Time: 1 minute, 40 seconds.

         System: 6MHZ AT/286 Clone, 1 x Miniscribe 6085 72 meg voice
                 coil 28 ms, DOS 4.01, 1 meg RAM drive, 1 meg cache.
        Arcmail: 1,273,367 bytes (.PKT), 9 down-link systems.
           Time: 26 minutes


     External utilities
     ------------------
     TosScan comes with two external utility programs to help maintain
     your message base.  Reply chain linking, killing  old messages or
     keeping an area within a certain number of messages, renumbering,
     and for QuickBBS  systems, the fastest pack and  reindex you have
     seen.


     Availability
     ------------
     By now I hope  you're saying "Ok ok, enough! Where do I get it?".
     TosScan, as you may or may not know, is a commercial product.  It
     will not be  available for download or file request.  It can only
     be purchased from the author.

     The current special price, valid for 30 days from initial release

     In closing
     ----------
     TosScan is THE ultimate echomail  processor for FrontDoor systems
     and I'm 100% sure you'll be glad you waited.  It works quite well
     and has  been filled  with features suggested  by dozens  of beta
     testers like myself.

     Here's what  a few of  my fellow Beta  testers have to  say about
     TosScan:


     "FrontDoor and TosScan  fit together seamlessly...They  are sim-
     ply  the best  network mailer  and echomail  processor available
     today... FrontDoor and  TosScan are  also the software of choice
     for point operation..."
                                     --- Bob Beilstein, 1:260/335

     "I used to run Binkley/Confmail/Opus, but I long lusted after the
     flexibility of QuickBBS.  But as an NEC and  defacto MacList star
     I needed a  fast, reliable echomail processor.  TosScanQ/286 lets
     me run QuickBBS."
                                     --- Eric Larson, 1:260/330

     " ...TosScan  has  taken  the  `worry' out  of processing a great
     deal of  mail.  Easy  to install, easy to maintain,  but most im-
     portant, it is  the most *ACCURATE*  mail processor I have seen."

                                     --- Bruce Bodger, NEC Net-170

     "TosScan has  made it easy  being a Hub  by it's shear  speed and
     power...It's everything you ever wanted in a  mail processor, all
     rolled up in one powerful package."

                                     --- Kelly Drown, 170/403

     "All  I  can  say  about  TosScan  is  that  it's  the _slickest_
     tosser/scanner  I've  ever seen  in my  entire  life.  ...TosScan
     was the best $30 investment I made, and may the IC strike me down
     with excommunication if I don't tell the truth.."

                                     --- Felix Kasza, 2:310/11

     FidoNews 6-51                Page 26                  18 Dec 1989


     "I have found TosScan to be a professionally conceived, executed,
     and supported  product.  It has provided me  with a low  cost and
     simple solution to  all of my echomail needs, with  a high degree
     of performance."
                                    --- Mark Howard, 1:260/340


     Every feature has been tried,  misused, abused and mangled during
     the long months of testing.  The result is a top notch product by
     an author that supports his products  and is readily available to
     answer his users' questions.

     Try it.  I know you will be glad you did.

     The Node At the End Of The Universe
     2:256/117
     By Steve Townsley

     Forget about uninterruptable power supplies this week the PSU
     went bang on an AT in the office. Luckly we know a good
     maintenance firm that happily trails the 170 miles from London
     just to fix problems like exploding computers.

     Now, like everyone else in the office, I thought that the AT
     power supply had blown. Apparently I was wrong. Our peculiar
     beast was not true blue and therefore didn't have an AT power
     supply but a '286 power supply.

     The intelligent amongst you may well ask, as I did, why a '286 is
     different from an AT. Well it isn't really. It's some of the odd
     bits that go into a 286 that are different from an AT. So while
     we are all proud of the fact that we have a small footprint AT be
     aware that a full AT power supply probably isn't in there.

     So as well as blowing the fuse, fusing the network, and generally
     destroying a computer we now have to wait for our maintenance man
     to come back with a '286 power supply. A perfect fit for the
     slimer AT!

     When your AT blows up, which I hope it never will, you can save
     yourself the error of ordering the wrong part by finding out
     whether you have a '286 or a real AT power supply.


     Graphics

     One of the subjects that occasionally crosses my mind is
     graphics. Not because I am some kind of expert but simply because
     the various formats are beginning to gain my interest.

     Like or not we are all heading towards graphics environments. The
     happy existance of 7 bit ASCII is on its way out. In place we may
     get variations of the Mac or something like Presentation Manager.

     I know quite a few Swedes, Danes, Germans and so on that will be
     pleased to see the end of 7 bit ASCII. In graphics mode all
     foreign language character sets, symbols, mathematics and so on
     become straightforward and unrestricted by the rather narrow
     ASCII set. Even the British would like to see the pound sign
     become more standardised across hardware and software.

     FidoNews 6-51                Page 29                  18 Dec 1989


     On my Epson printer at work a pound sign is ASCII 35 - I
     therefore lose the hash symbol. On my IBM proprinter the pound
     sign is ASCII 156 which carefully sits in the middle of Epson's
     italic character set. Finally there is yet another standard for
     Hewlett Packard LaserJets.... ASCII 175 (a double chevron).
     Daisy-wheel printers differ depending on which wheel you choose.

     In Britain we are only trying to print one character outside the
     American standard set. In Europe multiply the problem many times
     over.

     So in reality the acceptance of new graphics environments,
     whether PC, Amiga or ST should be good news.

     However I have to admit that something about these graphics
     environments throws me. Not only do they seem so much slower than
     my trusty, text based, PC-Write they also leave me with a feeling
     of 'do not touch'. I cannot quite explain it but when I finish
     this file I can type it to screen from a DOS prompt, copy it to a
     printer, even send it down a telephone line. Something about a
     graphics environment says that I will remove the simplicity of
     the command line to be replaced by a corporate designed
     leviathan.

     Already the TLA's (Three Letter Abreviations) indicate that
     graphics 'experts' are far worse than comms junkies. Who can tell
     what a TIF, GIF or PCX file really is. How do I explain a user
     friendly icon based environment in terms that the average citizen
     might be enthusiastic about. Do I really have to buy a 386, 8
     megabytes of memory, OS/2 Presentation Manager, Pagemaker and a
     laser printer just to create a letterhead on my continuous
     stationery.

     I have to confess to being partly a technological rebel. If
     someone could show how to include a letterhead from PC-Write on
     my trusty dot-matrix printer I would be inclined to feel that
     graphics have some place in my day to day computing. Wrestling
     with Ventura to send out a designed invoice on continuous
     stationery is hard work.

     Having to create 3 separate printer drivers for 3 different
     printers just to print a pound sign does not make me confident
     that graphics will help. Abandoning 7 bit ASCII should help all
     PC owners be more creative and help us foreigners with a
     universal standard character set. However I have this suspicion
     that maybe software developers are not going to make it that
     easy.


     Finally if you have a comment to make on anything I ramble on
     about address it to 'The Node At The End Of Universe somewhere in
     Zone 2' or shorthand 2:256/117. Yes I do have a Compuserve
     address - but it's far to expensive to use from this corner of
     the Galaxy.
