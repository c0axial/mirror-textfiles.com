                   IDEAS FOR A NEW -AND BETTER- FIDONET
                       (Let's make some changes...)

            Time goes by, and FidoNet grows every day faster. I don't
     think that, when creating the Fido Bulletin Board System, Tom
     Jennings knew he was starting something this big.
            I have lately read some articles, where sysops express
     their discomformity regarding the way things are going right now,
     specially with IFNA.
            Some sysops chose to form another, parallel net (like
     Ryugen Fisher, for example), some others just expressed their
     disappointness.
            Trhu this article, I want to give your my opinion, and to
     present you a new idea, a new idea that also contains new
     concepts.
            I think something MUST BE DONE, before it is "too late".
            The FidoNet nodelist has already 3000+ members, in all the
     5 continents of the world, on about 30 countries. FidoNet has
     become a totally INTERNATIONAL network, rather than an "American
     one with some nodes overseas".
            The new idea I want to propose is the following:
            One "FidoNet Association" is created for each of the 4
     zone (I'm assuming Latin America as Zone 4).
            Those associations may vary in their internal
     organization, since each zone's requirements and neccesities are
     very different.
            When they are finally established, each designates 3
     members to take part on the International FidoNet Council, that
     is finally formed by those 12 representants of the 4 zones.
            Each zone has the right to have the presidency of the
     Council for 6 months a year (each has the right to preside the
     council once every two years).
            The Council's president must be one of the 4 representants
     sent by the zone who designates him/her, and has the right to a
     double vote when a votation is tied.
            The International Council is in charge of various things,
     like designating the International Technical Coordinator, setting
     the technical standards (either directly or by naming a
     "technical comitee"), publishing the net's official newsletter,
     and establishing the net's basic, international
     rules. Comprehensive rules are established by each zone's
     association.
            The International Council also acts as a "supreme
     tribunal" for interzonal disputes. Any disputes within a zone are
     to be arbitrated by the zone's association.
            The Zonal FidoNet Associations are to be TRANSPARENTLY
     DEMOCRATIC, which ensures the democratic qualities of the
     International FidoNet Council, as well as of the net itself.
            The Zonal Associations have the right to name the
     coordinators for all the networks, regions as well as the zone's.
            I personally think this idea has still to be shaped
     up. Anyway, the "main idea", that puts a special emphasis in
     FidoNews 5-21                Page 2                   23 May 1988


     democracy, as well as on each sysops' right to determine their
     coordinators, authorities and delegates to the main,
     International Council, is there.
            I would like everybody to participate in the development
     of this new idea, to ensure it's representability of all the
     sysop's wishes.
            Please, send mail to node 368/101 (soon-to-be 800/1) with
     your opinions.
            If FidoNet's current authorities, as well as IFNA's
     consider the idea feasible, an echomail conference could be
     created to ensure everybody's participation on the development of
     this new idea.
            Thank you for taking the time to read this article, and
     thanks IFNA for maintaining a publication where everyone can
     express oneself freely.

     John Hamilton, 1:143/8

     U.S. Robotics 2400 bps internal, half-length modems are now available
     to SysOps and friends for $150.00. This offer is subject to change
     without further notice.

     Contact John Hamilton at 143/8 for information if you wish to place
     an order. There is no quantity limitation. You want 200 of them?
     Go ahead, make my day! Discounts can be negotiated for quantities
     over ten, but I will gladly sell one at a time.

     I use these modems personally in four commercial Fido v12h (tm)
     applications. To date they have performed as reliably as my
     Courier 2400s, which is just about bullet proof!

                 Spirituality/World Peace
                          by Susan Dubin

     Pagans, Christians, hippies, eclectics and Hindus are among
     those frequenting the new Spirituality/World Peace echo offered
     by The Angevin Empire.  If you hunger for the unusual, this
     echo is sure to satisfy.
     FidoNews 5-21                Page 7                   23 May 1988


     People of all faiths (including atheists!) are encouraged to
     participate. Instead of the commom face-offs and exclusive
     proclamations of the "truth", we are looking for the ways we
     are unified; the links which bind us together. Diverse
     participation and thoughtful conversation is common.

     The Spirituality/World Peace echo would do well both on a
     metaphysical BBS and  a technical or general one.  It is an
     interesting diversion from computer talk, and will serve to
     boost system usage.

     So, if you'd like to spice things up and perhaps do your bit
     for world peace, contact Aaron Priven at 1:204/1154 (PC-
     Pursuitable) and try a little "SPIRITUAL".
