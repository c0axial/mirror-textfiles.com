     =================================================================
                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================


     I'm  typing this on my laptop at FidoCon, about two  hours  after
     the  adjournment of the IFNA Board of Directors meeting.  It  was
     an  experience  that I'm just too tired to be able to communicate
     to  you  at  the moment.  But that won't save you from having  to
     read something that was passed in the meeting.

     The  reason  I  feel it necessary to put what is basically a news
     item into this Editorial is because I feel very strongly that you
     need to read  this  and  to think about it.  IFNA has thrown down
     the  gauntlet of Democracy  in  FidoNet  and  at  the  same  time
     addressed the claims that it  no  longer  deserves to exist.  You
     have been enfranchised in a process that can result in a complete
     change in the way FidoNet is administered,  as well as correcting
     any problems that you may have  observed  in IFNA, or to dissolve
     IFNA and proceed from there.

     The text of the specific Board of Directors resolution follows:

     We,    the    representatives    of  the  International  FidoNet
     Association, have heard a cry for democracy in the administration
     of the network.    As IFNA is supposed to represent the interests
     of the sysops, and  as  such  representation  is  deemed  to have
     failed, be it hereby resolved that:

     Without a mandate from the sysops of FidoNet, IFNA has no purpose
     or reason for existence.

     THEREFORE,  the  board  proposes  the following action, of  which
     failure to pass will mean the dissolution of IFNA:

     It  is  hereby  resolved  that  a  special election be  held  for
     consideration by the Sysops of FidoNet of the following:

       IFNA shall be empowered to re-draft the bylaws of  IFNA  and to
       draft  a  Policy  document for FidoNet.  Such documents are  to
       include:

         1.  An independent judicial system.

         2.  A reduced  size  Board  of  Directors,  to  be completely
             reseated in an election on or before FidoCon 1990.

         3.  Better representation from outside the United States.

         4.  Make each sysop  in  FidoNet  a  member  in IFNA with all
             rights and privileges of membership.

     FIDONEWS 6-35                Page 2                   28 Aug 1989


     Voting for referendum of  this  document shall be completed on or
     before December 1, 1989.  The rules of the election shall make it
     clear  that  failure of the election  to  approve  the  questions
     presented shall result in the current Board  of  Directors acting
     under Article XII to dissolve the corporation.

     In addition, it shall be made clear that  approval must be gained
     from a majority of the eligible nodes in the  nodelist  in effect
     at the time of the election.

     [End of IFNA BoD resolution]

     So, folks, here it is.   A shot at Democracy.  Tell your friends.
     Read it  carefully.    Discuss  it  with  the  rest  of your Net.
     There's an important  vote  coming  up,  and  you  need to decide
     whether you want to be enfranchised in  it or not.  I'd recommend
     that you take this opportunity to make your  voice heard.  You've
     never had a better chance.

     IFNA has finally determined that the 1986 plebiscite needs  to be
     re-held.   They've done so at a very propitious moment  for  both
     IFNA  and FidoNet.  What you need to decide here is  whether  you
     want  to  vote  for a "re-design" of IFNA (which is what a  "YES"
     vote  would  imply)  or  the dissolution of IFNA (which is what a
     "NO" vote or an abstention would imply).  You also need to state,
     in no uncertain  terms,  that  you  either want or do not want to
     take charge of your  own destiny, by VOTING on the issue!  Please
     consider the issues carefully and  use  the  mechanism  provided.
     This is not just about whether to  empower or not to empower IFNA
     to run the Network.  We have an ideal  opportunity  to  create  a
     stirring precedent here.  Don't pass it up.

           MESSAGE TO FIDOCON FROM ZONE 1 REGIONAL COORDINATORS


     This message was delivered by Marv Carson and David Garrett to
     FidoCon attendees on behalf of the zone-1 Regional Coordinators.
     It is reproduced here in the form distributed at FidoCon.


     GENERAL REMARKS
     The Zone 1 Regional Coordinators wish to extend our best wishes
     to the Hosts and attendees for an enjoyable and successful
     FidoCon.  Further we wish to thank the FidoCon Committee for
     giving us the opportunity present this message to you.

     Please hold your questions and comments until this entire message
     is read. This message is a joint statement of the individuals who
     serve as your Zone 1 Regional Coordinators, however, the Regional
     Coordinators here at FidoCon welcome your questions, comments and
     suggestions and will respond to them the best we can.  But
     keep in mind that we can only share our individual opinions on
     subjects not presented here.

     It is a brief statement covering only nine items, but with it, we
     want to clarify some issues and share our position with you all
     on some others.  Primarily, the items presented here are in no
     way intended to impede the current progress of Democracy and
     Policy 5 activities.  Nor are they intended to circumvent Policy
     4.  They merely represent our true opinions, some proposals, and
     our unified position regarding our procedures on issues until a
     new policy is formally approved.

     1 -FIDONET & COORDINATORS
     First we want to give assurance that we believe the so called
     "grunt sysop" is the essence of FidoNet.  In fact, we as coordi-
     nators also see ourselves as "grunt sysops", but who have taken
     additional responsibility by volunteering time and expenses to
     help make FidoNet work for us by assisting other sysops and
     providing nodelist services.  We truly wish that was all that
     was required and no written policy or policy enforcement was
     necessary by us or anyone.  But without some adherence to guide-
     lines, the inconsistency of human nature has proven to reduce our
     enjoyment of this hobby.  Your job AND ours is to help set those
     guidelines so that the "guidelines" themselves do not reduce our
     enjoyment of this hobby.  Policy 4 gives us the opportunity to do
     that.

     2 -EXCOMMUNICATIONS
     This is a sensitive subject.  Some inaccurate perceptions exist
     regarding how *C's have handled this sometimes necessary, yet
     infrequent and unpleasant task.  Perhaps the word "excommunica-
     tion" is inappropriate here.  No node should be "excommunicated".
     A more appropriate word might be "removal".  Here's how it should
     FIDONEWS 6-35                Page 4                   28 Aug 1989


     work when a serious problem occurs.  A formal policy complaint is
     issued to both the node and the next level *C.  Normally the node
     is granted a period of time to make corrections.  If he refuses,
     his original node number is removed.  A temporary node number may
     be granted a removed node to provide communications in resolving
     an appeal.  Removals should not be for "eternity", because a
     "cooling off" period can sometimes help get corrections com-
     pleted.  Then, when corrections are made, a node number should be
     permitted reinstatement. Further, we've seen the "recovered"
     sysop frequently makes a better FidoNet member than some sysops
     who seldom participate at all.  We do not condone a removed
     node's external participation in FidoNet Mail. Further, his
     future reinstatement may be delayed if his "unauthorized" partic-
     ipation includes messages that demonstrate he has no intention of
     making the required corrections.  Ultimately, perhaps a new
     policy will provide for an independent and unbiased panel of
     regular FidoNet sysops to make these judgments.

     3 -DEMOCRACY
     There are many issues to resolve when formulating an election
     process for the *C's at all levels that will win acceptance in a
     new policy document. Meanwhile, we agree that some sort of
     democratic process should be and eventually will be implemented.
     To assist this process, the Regional Coordinators endorse a
     democratic process and are now actively participating in develop-
     ing democratic methods and procedures.  Input from all sysops is
     welcomed and especially from those where elections have already
     been held.  Their experience would help us by sharing their
     successes and failures to assist the development of a unified
     election policy item.

     4 -ECHOMAIL
     We view the roles of *C's and *EC's as completely separate from
     one another. We believe that an echo mail conference is the respon-
     sibility of its conference moderator.  Echomail coordinators
     should formulate their own policy as an associated document with
     FidoNet policy. The NC's and RC's should assist them in their
     efforts however possible.

     5 -IFNA
     The concepts of IFNA are useful and appropriate when its elected
     leaders pursue the responsibilities of their positions and
     fulfill IFNA's statement of purpose.  If and/or when this DOES
     NOT occur, there will be no and should be no impact on FidoNet or
     its Coordinators.  However, if and/when it DOES occur, FidoNet
     coordinators should cooperate with IFNA however possible.  In
     essence, FidoNet will continue regardless of the fate of IFNA.

     6 -LAWSUITS
     FidoNet is still and will remain an amateur (as in Non-Commer-
     cial) electronic network.  As such, it is a hobby, and membership
     in it requires responsible conduct of its members.  Lawsuits or
     threats of lawsuits are not considered responsible conduct.  Such
     actions (related to Fidonet) against a another member or *C
     should be condemned by all members.  Regardless of the foolish-
     ness of such a threat or action, they simply should not occur.
     FIDONEWS 6-35                Page 5                   28 Aug 1989


     Soon to be elected coordinators who help bind this net together
     would drop out instantly if legal litigation began proving that
     "No good deed goes unpunished".

     7 -NODELIST
     In addition to the IFNA copyright, the FidoNet nodelist may be
     individually copyrighted by the creator/editor of each of its
     segments.  Under no circumstances should a combined nodelist be
     renamed or appended into another list for subsequent distribu-
     tion, without the express written approval of creator of each
     segment involved.  This process is analogous to a software
     utility author's requirements that their archive file maintain
     its original contents.

     8 -BIX
     There are many reasons for FidoNet policy to adhere to its "Non-
     Commercial" position, primarily if some commercial enterprise
     attempts to exploit the network and return nothing to its mem-
     bers.  Many fine FidoNet members currently rely on the support of
     their own businesses to subsidize their operating costs.  In so
     doing, those business make a contribution to FidoNet members who
     rely on them for echomail and other services.  They manage do to
     this and for the most part avoid complaints regarding their
     "commercial status" from other FidoNet members.  The BIX proposal
     issue is different from these examples.  As we stated in our
     DEMOCRACY comments, some things may have to be worked out after
     we've learned more.  But for the most part, as we understand it,
     the BIX proposal would return some benefits for participating
     FidoNet members by reducing their costs for echomail.  We feel we
     should not unduly interfere with what may be beneficial to some
     sysops and should permit this experiment.  We will assist in the
     arrangements involved to the extent that both sides will have a
     clear understanding of them.  We'll just have to await the
     outcome from the FidoNet members who use this BIX service and in
     so doing, let the them help decide rather it should continue or
     not.

     9 -IC SELECTION
     The ZC Council has unanimously agreed that Matt Whelan, of
     Australia, should be the next IC.  None of the four current ZC's
     were willing to take the IC job.  That left them in a situation
     not covered by Policy 4.  Under normal circumstances, the IC
     could interpret policy to handle this.  Since there was no IC to
     make such a ruling, logic dictated that in this situation the ZC
     Council should make the ruling.  The ZC Council decided unani-
     mously that in the in the absence of a current ZC willing to take
     the IC job, that past ZC's should be considered the next best
     thing.  Matt Whelan was a past ZC and by unanimous vote of the ZC
     council, is now the current IC.  The Zone 1 Regional Coordinators
     are pleased with that selection and feel that Matt will do an
     excellent job.

     CLOSING
     Thank you for giving us this opportunity to share our thoughts
     with you.

     Sincerely,

     Zone 1 - Regional Coordinators

     FidoNet Zone Council:
     Bill Bolton,    3:3/0
     Steve Bonine,   1:1/0
     Ron Dwight,     2:2/0
     Pablo Kleinman, 4:4/0


     Current FidoNet policy  gives the responsibility of selection of
     the International Coordinator to the Zone Council, which is made
     up of the Zone Coordinators.  The Zone Council has reached a
     unanimous choice of Matt Whelan, 3:712/627, as FidoNet's new
     International Coordinator.

     This selection was not a straightforward procedure, as none of
     the current Zone Coordinators was willing to accept the IC
     position.  Policy4 states that the IC is the "first among equals
     ZC" and states that it is the responsibility of the ZC's to
     select the IC "from among their ranks."  Thus, the Zone Council
     was faced with a situation not covered explicitly by Policy4.

     Policy4 gives the IC the power to interpret policy in this type
     of situation.  However, David Dodell stated in his resignation
     notice in the NodeDiff that he was unwilling to rule on policy
     issues.  This left the responsibility with the Zone Council.

     After extensive discussion, the Zone Council reached a unanimous
     decision that in this case of no current ZC being willing to
     accept election as IC, then persons who had held the position of
     ZC in the past should be considered.  Further, the Zone Council
     reached a unanimous decision that Matt Whelan should be elected.

     Matt will be officially installed in the nodelist on September 1,
     NODELIST.244.  The address of n/1000 will be placed in each zone
     segment (1:1/1000, 2:2/1000, 3:3/1000, 4:4/1000).  Sysops outside
     zone 3 are warned that the actual international telephone number
     will be placed into these nodelist entries; to route mail through
     the zonegate the message should be sent to Matt's "real" address
     of 3:712/627.

     WHAT IS THE COMPUTER LEARNING FOUNDATION & WHY A COMPUTER
     LEARNING MONTH?

     Developing computer competency among our youth is critical to the
     future of Canada, the  united States and our children. It can
     play a major role in maintaining our competitive edge and in
     addressing major concerns of literacy ,school dropouts and job
     training. Technology also offers powerful benefits to children
     today and thier futures. Increasingly, people are being required
     to use computers and software at work. By the year 2010, when our
     children are in the prime of thier careers, experts predict all
     jobs will require somme use of technology.

     Millions of children, however, are not yet recieving the full
     benefits of technology, as confirmed by a recent study by the
     National Assessment of Educational Progress, funded by the U.S.
     Department of Education. While many children are being exposed to
     computers in school,in most cases,the depth of thier experiences
     is severely limited. On average, there is only one computer to
     every 30 students, and often there are far less. A recent study
     by the Office of Technology Assessment,Power On, also revealed
     that almost 2/3 of our teachers have recieved less than ten hours
     of training about computers. As our teachers and parents did not
     grow up with computers, they both need help understanding the
     benefits computers and software offer children and ways to
     provide them with meaningful computer experiences.

     The Computer Learning Foundation is a non-profit educational
     foundation serving the United States and Canada. While our
     overall goal is to increase the number of people recieving the
     benefits of technology, our primary focus is on developing
     computer competency among our youth. To achieve our goal, we
     provide numerous programs and materials that provise parents and
     teachers with the information and resources they need to assist
     our children.

     The computer competency the Computer Learning Foundation is
     striving for is of far greater signifigance than learning to
     program. Computers and Software are means to an end, not ends in
     themselves. We encourage parents and teachers to consider
     computers and software as tools for assisting children, just like
     a dictionary, a pencil or a calculator, and not as an isolated
     activity. We need to integrate children's experiences with
     computers into other activities in thier lives--writing papers,
     learning history or math, creating pictures, doing home projects
     and the like.

     Every October, the Computer Learning Foundation hosts Computer
     Learning Month, a monthlong focus of events and activities for
     learning new uses of computers and software, sharing ideas and
     helping others gain the benefits of computers and software. While
     Computer Learning foundation materials are available all year,

                     Some first impressions of FidoCon
                    By several occupants of the WOC Inn
                           San Jose, California

     Hi, this is Vince.  While sitting here in the WOC Inn right after
     the 'Con, it  occurred  to us that it might be nice to enter some
     of our most immediate impressions, before we (probably correctly)
     started forgetting them.  So a few of us will enter some thoughts
     here for you to hopefully get the idea of just what was happening
     in beautiful San Jose, while you had to WORK for a living...

     For  me,  the  most  significant development was  the  successful
     deployment  of  the  F-37  Stealth  Cookie.  Government  Security
     regulations prevent me from going into any significant details of
     its  operation,  but believe me, the Pentagon will get plenty  of
     value for its 3 billion dollars of development costs!

     The pizza party in the WOC Inn wasn't as much fun  as  at  Cincy.
     But  that's  because so many of us were in the IFNA BoD  meeting,
     which ran until almost 3 AM.  Now I remember why I didn't want to
     be  on  the  Board.  See if they can talk me into being someone's
     proxy NEXT year...

     I finally met Alan Applegate.  And  it  was  about time.  I don't
     regret for a minute the decision to work  with  him.  The kind of
     folks you meet through this medium are just the greatest.

     John Dvorak was really funny.  Worth every drop of sweat that Les
     had to pay (he helped him with a communications book) to get him.

     Finally,  IFNA's meetings were a  lot  more  interesting  than  I
     expected.  Only time will tell  how  important.

     Enough from me, here's Les Kooyman:

     Wow.  Really.  I hardly know what to  say at this point.  The Con
     was  more  of a success than I dared expect...   several  of  the
     vendors  in  attendance  became philanthropic on the spot just in
     time to allow me to give away their stuff...  a USR Dual Standard
     HST modem, multi-line  copies  of  both TBBS and Wildcat, lots of
     software  from  SEA  including  Qsort  and  the  ARC  compression
     library...  if I forgot  anyone,  please forgive me, I'll make it
     up to you.  As for  my  involvement with IFNA, I am not sure what
     prompted me to run for a highly  visible  office, other than that
     strange  Australian  beer  and  Peppermint Schnapps from the  Woc
     Inn....    seriously, I look forward to the opportunity  to  work
     vigorously  for    the  realization  of  FidoNet's  yearning  for
     democracy as President  of  IFNA.    I  hope to be worthy of your
     trust, because TRUST is  the  most important component of the new
     FidoNet (hey, If Lee Iacocca  can  use  it,  so  can  I)  we  are
     creating.  I don't know if  Carl  Linden  suspected how prophetic
     his phrase "FidoCon...  a New Beginning" really was.

     On the followup side, all the speakers showed, we made some money
     rather than lost any, and we all had fun.  Sysops just wanna have
     fun.... now hand me another one of those cookie bombs.

     Here's something from Jim Deputy:

     Like Les, I don't know quite where to start.  There is a definite
     change in the wind.  It can be considered a  "New  Beginning"  or
     the  end  of  something  we  know, and the beginning of something
     totally new.

     Personally,  I  would like to go with the least amount of change.
     The proposals that I have seen, and as I understand at this point
     seem to be both  somewhat  radical,  and also present interesting
     options.

     The IFNA "Mandate Vote" sounds  interesting.  The re-write of the
     IFNA by-laws sounds even more interesting.    The  idea  of using
     IFNA  as  an  in-place  organization,  and  "pushing"  them  into
     recognizing  the options of being a truely representative  group,
     for  us,  the  "grunt  Sysops",  and  giving  us  the  democratic
     representation  that  we  have  been  demanding, and spending big
     buck$ with the phone companies to discuss is now here.

     At this  point, and until I can see some concrete proposals, I am
     still undecided which way  I  will  go  with  the "new IFNA".  As
     always the SYSOP ECHO is  a  neat  place to discuss it, and also,
     the  Conference  will  be  moving  back   into  FidoNet's  Domain
     effective before the first of the month  the announcement will be
     there.

     Vince again:

     OK,  enough for first thoughts.  I'm glad  that  the  Con  was  a
     success and I hope that more of you will be able to share the fun
     with  us  next  year.  By the way, I think  that  IFNA  is  still
     looking  for a site for next year.  If your area  is  interested,
     you should  contact  the Site Selection Committee, c/o IFNA.  Use
     node 1:1/10 as an address.

     An Event of Galactic Importance

     Voyager 2 Passes Neptune!

     by Phil Buonomo, 1:107/583, 7:520/583, 9:807/1

     It's been there for years, at the end of FidoNews.  How well we
     all know it by now:

     24 Aug 1989
        Voyager 2 passes Neptune

     Well, this is the last newsletter you'll ever see the above in.
     This week, after 12 years, and billions of miles, Voyager 2 is
     about to complete its mission in our solar system.  This friday,
     at 12:00am EDT, Voyager will pass over Neptune's north pole,
     only 3,000 miles from its surface.

     This remarkable event culminates a journey which began with a
     launch on August 21, 1977.  Since then, Voyager 2 has visited
     and photographed Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and now Neptune, dis-
     covering fascinating information along the way.  These discover-
     ies have given us insights into the formation of our solar sys-
     tem, and its place in the cosmos. At Jupiter, Voyager discovered
     atmospheric motions, faint rings, studied the geology of major
     moons (including discovery of volcanic action on one!), and
     three new moons.

     At Saturn, its beautiful rings were studied, with remarkable
     results.  "Spokes" were discovered, and even a "braided" ring,
     an explanation for which scientists are still searching, was
     found!  Additionally, three new moons were also discovered.

     At Uranus, two new rings were found around the planet, along
     with a unique "tilted" magnetic field.  Ten new moons were also
     discovered, and their geology studied.

     Now, Voyager is about to visit its last planet before it moves
     on into interstellar space.  It has already discovered a large
     spot in Neptune's atmosphere, not unlike the "great red spot" of
     Jupiter (thought to be a permanent hurricane big enough to swal-
     low our own planet several times over), and four new moons.  The
     most remarkable discovery to date, however, is the presense of
     "ring arcs", partially formed rings surrounding the planet, like
     the fully formed rings circling Saturn and Uranus.  These par-
     tially completed rings have stirred major discussion amongst
     NASA scientists to explain their origin.


     This entire journey is made all the more remarkable by the fact
     that it was planned that Voyager would only visit Jupiter and
     Saturn.  Along the way, Voyager has lost its main radio receiver
     and suffered damage to its backup, computer memory and televi-
     sion camera platform.  But like the Volkswagon Beetle of a past
     decade, the spacecraft keeps plugging along on 22 watts, about
     enough for a good flashlight.
     FIDONEWS 6-35                Page 14                  28 Aug 1989


     The best is yet to come, however.  After passing above Neptune's
     north pole, Voyager 2 will disappear behind the planet for 49
     minutes.  About four hours later, it will cruise by Triton, the
     only discovered moon in our solar system to have an atmosphere.
     Some scientists believe Triton to be covered by seas of liquid
     nitrogen.  Others predict a rocky surface.  Soon, we may know
     the truth.

     Once it passes Triton, Voyager may continue to transmit data for
     up to 25 years.  It will move into interstellar space, taking it
     outside the known limits of our solar system on a course that
     will not take it within one light-year of any known star for the
     next 958,000 years.

     Will Voyager's journey outlast man's existence in the universe?
     We may never know.  But the information it has provided us with
     in its short lifespan has been invaluable.  Voyager carries with
     it greetings from planet Earth to any far flung civilizations in
     the cosmos it may one day come across.  In the meantime, it has
     brought to life the words of science fiction we all know so
     well; "...to explore strange new worlds..."  and "...to go where
     no man has gone before!" Except that in this case, we are not
     seeing fiction.  We are living our childhood dreams and seeing
     them come true.  My friends, the future is HERE!

     Let us not forget that space IS the "final frontier", or that
     the Voyager mission was drastically cut back for lack of funds.
     Let us continue our quest for knowlege in the great void, to
     continue to advance our space program.  Let us continue to try
     to make those dream of our childhood become reality.  Let us
     build that moonbase, the space station.  Let us GO to Mars and
     beyond.  Let us not forget the dream because our pockets are too
     shallow.  Let us move FORWARD!

     So many years ago, Thom Henderson put the Voyager message in the
     calendar of FidoNews.  Perhaps it was half-joke, half-necessity
     (to make the calendar work), perhaps not (I know that Thom is a
     big supporter of space exploration). But what was once a trivial
     line in a newsletter month after month, has taken on a rare sig-
     nificance: the discovery of a new planet.  Let us not forget the
     importance of the Voyager mission as we move towards the new
     Millenium.

     With that, we bid adieu to Voyager.  She was a great experiment,
     one which paid off handsomely, beyond any of her designer's
     wildest dreams.  Perhaps someday we may meet up with her again,
     and who knows? Perhaps she wil have some new secrets to tell us.
