========================================================================
    We have decided to attempt a Fidocon next summer, here in
net 221 (South Western Ontario).   Cory Albrecht, one of the
local net people, has started a host BBS to co-ordinate it, and
we have started a local echo for planning.  Currently, the echo
is being distributed to half a dozen nets in South Western
Ontario.  Hopefully, it will soon be getting much wider
distribution.

    What are we attempting to do?  Basically, we want a chance
for all fidonet members to meet as many net friends as is
possible.  At the least, Max and I are going to have one heck
of a big party here next August.  At best, those of you who
always wanted to visit Canada will be able to make all your
holiday plans by netmail ... we will get several information BBSes
set up for everything from art gallery tours to camping and
fishing, and about 5-600 families will start or end their
holidays here in Kitchener.

     So read Cory's article, and start planning ...

FidoCon is Coming!(or "How to Build the Global Village")

By Cory C. Albrecht, FidoCon '95 BBS, 1:221/256.0

Yes, FidoCon is on it's way! Specifically FidoCon '95 in Kitchener-
Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. Because there has not been been a FidoCon
in several years, and nor has there ever been one in Canada, it it's
high time we have another one! So set aside time in August 1995 to
come to FidoCon and talk about "Building the Global Village."

Not only do we want you to come to our wonderful region, but we want
you to help set up FidoCon '95! We want you to tell us what speakers
you want to see -  Tom  Jennings?  Wynn  Wagner?  Maybe even Steve
Winters?  :-)  We need you to make FidoCon '95 an event to be
remembered (if it's even going to be an event at all). We want one
Sysop in (hopefully) every net world-wide to be a FidoCon '95
promoter for their area. If you have helped put to a convention or
have good organizational skills, we would love to hear from you! We
also welcome othernets to participate in FidoCon '95. If you are a
Sysop on a board that is a part of another net and are willing to
act as a liaison, let us know.

So, get your NEC to bug your REC to bug the R12EC to get the echo
"FIDOCON95" from the N221EC so we can get this thing off the ground!
Start your own local echoes to tell everybody about FidoCon '95 and
get them hyped to attend! We want you here not only to tell us where
FidoNews 11-38                 Page:  3                    19 Sep 1994

you want Fidonet to go in the future, but also to help us build the
Global Village.

Subject: DISCONT.ART

Now is the Discontent of our Winter
by David Rice

In the Vol. 11 No. 34 issue of FidoNews, there was mention of a
weekly Bible column. I -love- the idea! I mean, like, that's
what FidoNews is for, isn't it?! Why SURE it is! It is not as
if people could actually go out and get a Bible and read it
themselves if they wanted to--- what with the Pagan Left
censoring everything good and wholesome and godly. It's not as
if there were over a dozen echoes dedicated to the topic, each
one more Biblical and True than the next. It's not as if one
can find a Bible in every motel room throughout the nation, or
ask the Geidion Society for a few hundred free ones, or that
one may go into any used book store and pick one up for a dime.
Ah, no! Certainly not! We -must- have a Bible column in
FidoNews--- what computer related, network oriented newsletter
would be complete without a Bible column?! It's only logical,
right? You betcha!

After the Bible column has been underway for a few weeks, we
should also have a weekly astrological column as well. That's
fair, ain't it? And topical to FidoNews, right? Of course it is.

And a cooking column. There's the ticket. Every computer
network newsletter should have a cooking column. We should hear
all about how to prepare boneless chicken and Lima beans in
FidoNews. This is vital information, not available anywhere else.

Not to mention the weekly Household Tips column. Those grass
stains on the knees of one's jeans sure are a bitch to get out,
don't you agree? Of course you do: that's why we -need- this
column too!

Naturally if these new weekly columns--- Bible, Astrological,
Cooking, and Household Tips--- are rejected as not suitable for
FidoNews, I'm going to scream "censorship" at the top of my
lungs, to everyone who will listen (and plenty who won't) until
the editors cave in to my demands. Hell, maybe I'll sue them.

[Washington insiders say the phone calls and faxes (especially to Rep
 Jack Brooks) are starting to attract significant attention, and many
 people prophesize that the bill won't even have time  to  pass  this
 session.  Thanks for your efforts!]

The FBI's Wiretap bills (also known as the DT - Digital Telephony
bills) mandate that *all* communications carriers must provide
wiretap-ready equipment so that the FBI can more easily implement
their court-ordered wiretaps more easily.  The costs of
re-engineering all communications equipment will be borne by the
government, industry and consumers.

The bill is vague and the standards defining "wiretap ready" do not
exist.  Furthermore, the FBI has yet to make a case which
demonstrates that they have been unable to implement a wiretap.

There are fewer than 1,000 court ordered surveillances per year.
Even if all of them are wiretaps, and even if all of them require the
changes mandated by this legisation, are we as a nation prepared to
build eavesdropping features into the phones of 250 million people,
in order to justify these wiretaps?  None of these wiretaps has been
demonstrated to be unimplementable, nor has it been proven that the
cases could not be made with other methods of electronic surveillance.

The Voters Telecomm Watch (VTW) does not believe the FBI has made a
compelling case to justify that all Americans give up their privacy.
Furthermore, the VTW does not believe the case has been made to
justify spending 500 million Federal dollars over the next 4 years to
re-engineer equipment to compromise privacy, interfere with
telecommunications privacy, and fulfill an unproven government need.

Tell them you are opposed to the FBI's Wiretap legislation.  Feel
free to use the sample communique below:

SAMPLE COMMUNIQUE
                          =================

 Dear __________,

 The recent Digital Telephony bills (HR 4922 & SB 2375) disturb me
 greatly.  The FBI has not yet made their case to the public that we
 need to build wiretap functionality into the telephones of 250
 million people to justify wiretaps which have not yet been proven to
 be difficult to implement.

 The bills would clearly compromise the privacy of all Americans with
 no counterbalancing benefit to either law enforcement or the public.
 The FBI has not demonstrated the need, and the cost is uncalculated,
 but is known to be at least 500 million tax dollars.

 Furthermore, the standards are undefined, as are the bodies that
 would enact these standards.

 For these reasons, I am opposed to the Digital Telephony bills
 (HR 4922 & SB 2375).

 Sincerely,

Traffic Violations Bureau
Winnipeg, Manitoba
Canada

My Dear Doctor Logger,

What a surprise to have arrived here in Winnipeg on the one day a
year that people actually go out of doors. This city almost
certainly possesses a climate that is overly mean even for this
country, and has reacted by burrowing underground.

I'm certain that there is no other burg on the planet that
actually prohibits pedestrians from crossing the street at its
busiest intersection. Here in Winnipeg, they've actually built
earthworks that resemble an 18th century fortress around the
intersection, just in case someone would be foolish enough to
both be outside and attempt to cross the street. Obviously, the
city fathers were unaware that, once every 20 years or so, there
is an exception from the usual two weather options, being: 40
below zero, or; huge swarms of insects. Needless to say, Ms.
LaBamba created something of a stir by insisting upon crossing
the street, and doing so while clad in her leopard-skin Lambada
dancing outfit.

Please advise Sylvia that there may be some correspondence
forthcoming from the Winnipeg Traffic Violations Bureau. Some
people just have no sense of humour. Did I mention that I could
FidoNews 11-38                 Page:  9                    19 Sep 1994

use a small sum of money to bail out Ms. Labamba? Ten thousand or
so, preferably in small, unmarked bills would be most convenient.

Back to business. I must confess to having spent the last week
convinced that our beloved RC had passed on to his reward. Not a
sign of him anywhere, and believe me, I have searched in every
massage parlour, table-dance emporium, and cheesy watering hole
on the prairies. It hasn't been pretty.

I even detoured through a place called Gimli, which has a unique
blend of Icelandic, Ukrainian and Cree inhabitants, after hearing
a strange report of a huge windsurfing competition being held
there. Naturally, I went there because I felt it would have been
a perfect place for an RC to hide, and not to witness svelt, wet
young ladies with butt-floss bikinis riding windsurfers. But,
sadly, there was no sign of the RC there either. I did, however,
partake in the cultural oddity of eating perogies, served by a
thick ankled, near-albino woman dressed in feathers, in the
"Valhalla" restaurant, which is tastefully decorated in native
mandallas. And they say Quebec is distinct. Go figure.

But finally, after all the searching and waiting, the RC appeared
in the most unlikely place - the regional echo which he
'moderates.' Needless to say, it was heartening to see evidence
that Rick "Weekend at Bernies" Johnston was, in fact, alive. It
was somewhat less than heartening to see that his first message
to his adoring grunt sysops was a protracted paranoid whine that
seemed to insinuate that dark, evil forces are at work in
preventing him from performing those highly technical duties of
distributing the nodelist and the 'snooze.

I think he must be right. In fact, I think the reasons for his
many, many absences, the erratic gunboat diplomacy that has led
him to defrock elected NCs, and now the inability to promulgate
the regional nodelists can only be explained by one thing -- The
CIA.

I don't think that it's any coincidence that the Excited States
of Murrica is about to invade Haiti at the same time Region 12 is
undermined from within. If you don't believe me, do you think its
a coincidence that Mark Skaff has now returned to Net163 AND that
it's been proven that Elvis' body was actually a large, sweaty
wax replica? I didn't think so. I'll get to the bottom of this,
Logger, I'm off to Washington D.C. as soon as I rescue Ms.
LaBamba and Sylvia resolves the little matter of my Calgary
travel expenses. (Honestly, as if I was the first person to ever
hire naked country line dancers. I needed to witness the Western
ambiance firsthand. So to speak.)

I also understand that net250's squabbles grow deeper, and, in
order to receive mail, various factions have now purchased
satellite dishes, which they waggle menacingly at one another.
The Almighty has already expressed His opinion of this occurence,
by spiking a few zillion volts into one of them via a Thor-like
lightning bolt. As your spiritual advisor, I'd offer up this

incident as proof of divine justice, and would suggest that you
keep your inbounds land-lined. Mind you, given the right weather,
one can roast a chicken extremely quickly with one of those
dishes.

I'll report in from Washington posthaste.

Religiously Yours,

Rev. Richard Visage
Spiritual Advisor, Region 12

NBA ECHO IS HERE!

by Damian Stamm
NBA_ECHO   1:273/406

Here come Barkley down the lane......SLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMMMMMMM DUNK!!!!

Yes folks, its finally here.  The long awaited and long overdue NBA_ECHO
has finally reached the backbone for Fidonet.  Basketball, which for too
long was the only major sport not covered on the backbone, has finally
gotten membership into this list of members.

A suffering Sixers fan, I have been attempting to get this on the
backbone so I can get some moral support after a terrible '92-'93
season.  However, I love the Sixers draft, and am ready to battle it
out with the New York fans who think they're hot stuff and the Chicago
fans who believe Michael Joradan is God.  Also, I am an aspiring sports
writer whose primary interest is basketball.  This echo has the best
basketball fans out there, from California to Philly, from Louisianna
to Canada.

There are plenty of basketball fans out there, and there are probably
quite a few on your system.  So don't throw a brick and miss the
playoffs by not picking up this echo!  Draft a Glenn Robinson by
picking up the echo! Your users will thank you for it.  :)

For three.....ITS GOOD!

A reply to Steve Boisvenue  (1:167/319)

First: There are more than one churches in the world. The katholic
Church of Rome is a very large one and there are many small one
in USA, but they are all different.

You write:

> 1-  They claim homosexuality is unnatural, which can be proven to be
> false with any trip to the zoo or into the wild.

In my church, the "Evangelische Kirche im Rheinland", a protestantic
church in Germany, there is a large discussion this year in every
of their parishes about the question, if pairs of men, who want
that, can get a blessing for their partnership. I hope, that the
members of our Synode will decide that this is a possibility for
our pastors.

You write:
> 2- The church denies the fact that the world is over-populated, and
> continues to loby to ban abortions and the use of birth controll.

This is not true. "The" church has different ideas about who to stop
the growing of the world-population: No abortion, and there are many
who say: Only "natural" family planning. But most of the churches
I know say: We need the condom and we need the Anti-Baby-Pill.

You write:
> 3-  They want to ban euthanasia (mercy killing\right to die) in order
> to "protect God's will."   Yet, they support almost any medical act
> to prolong the lives of, or revive people who would otherwise be dead.

There would many to be to write. Only one remark: I don't know a
church that supports _any_ medical act. I only know churches that
support _human_ medical acts -  and if analgesics would shorten
life, it will be accepted.

You write:
> 4- Women are still denied any high-level positions in the church.

There are many protestantic churches (yet also the Anglicanic Church
of England) with female priests or pastors. In Germany and in other
contries round the world there are also female Bishops. A female
leader of a church is only a question of time in many churches
around the world.

You write:
> 5- The church is still activly lobbying for forced prayer in American
> schools.

Well, I am in Germany, and here most of the churches are not lobbying
for forced prayers in scholls.

Those are facts - and I am really not blind!

Re-engineering of Net 700
Chris Leung (6:700/703 aka 6:700/0)

Please be informed that due to the following chaotic situations,
Net700 will be dissolved and restarted afresh in order to get
everything back to order.

1.  The former Network Coordinator (NC) still claims publicly that he
    is the N700C and continues to issue new node numbers to new sysops.
    He makes his own version of local nodelist and delivers it through
    the mail routing hubs to current fido sysops.  With the help of
    the current Network Echomail Coordinator (NEC), the fact of the
    re-appointment of N700C by the RC is being denied and totally
    concealed from all Net700 members.

2.  Although notice has been issued to the NEC and HUBs about the
    change of NC,  they still refuse to accept this fact.  They are
    unwilling to cooperate with the new NC.  Even worse, the NEC
    together with the mail routing hubs help distribute a fake
    international nodelist to all fido members.  Although attempts
    have been made to deliver the genuine international nodelists to
    all sysops via HUBs, it seems that none gets delivered
    successfully.  As per POLICY 4, such behaviour is considered to
    be excessively annoying.

3.  Many current sysops refuse to accept the decision and appointment
    made by the RC.  Being fido sysops, they should have read and
    agree to abide by FidoNet Policy currently in force.  In other
    words, they should know and understand the procedures for NC
    appointment. Failing to do so is considered to be failing to
    observe POLICY 4.

The trouble stirred up the former NC+NEC party causes serious
annoyance to many users.  In view of this, the current structure of
Net700 has to be dissolved and re-established.  Details will be made
available to Net700 sysops and users...

FidoNet is for fun, not for any power struggle!
FidoNet is for friendship, not for making any enemy!
FidoNet is for free communication, not for any censorship or control!
FidoNet is for all, not just for any *C!

Thank you very much for your attention, and let's sing requiem to
the chaotic Net700!
