Editorial: Slog

by Tom Jennings (1:1/1)

This week, just tidbits. No flaming controversies (no I'm not
complaining).

-- ARTSPEC.DOC; I *lost* my copy of ARTSPEC.DOC! This absurd occurrence
happened by having a number of "special" files slip through the cracks
of my otherwise-robust backup scheme; I installed a new hard disk a week
or two ago, and it simply didn't get copied. I have to rummage around in
the net for another copy... sorry to all you filerequestors wasting
nickels (quarters -- its 1991) on my system.

-- THE INTERRUPT STACK; you may have noticed I dropped it. Two problems.
One, bum information. OK, OK, area code 702 is already allocated, I find
out. Two, I get requests for all sorts of silly insertions, like pet
canarie's birthdays and such. Sorry! Maybe later I'll do something about
it ("Don't do today what you can put off til tomorrow.")

-- PROGRAM VERSIONS LIST; some of our sharper readers have noticed that
BinkleyTerm, Fido/FidoNet, and other once-popular programs are no longer
supported, and have entirely disappeared from use in the net. Or so you
might think from reading the versions list. There has been a problem
with the list-compiler, David French, getting mail within his net. He's
since changed net numbers, and is now 1:103/250. I promise it will be
fixed by next week. (For those of you taking this literally (my
apologies to English-not-as-a-first-language readers, really)
BinkleyTerm, Fido/FidoNet, and other programs missing from the list are
still supported, and merely missing from the list.)

-- FIDONET NET NEWS; an excellent idea for a regular FidoNews department
that unfortunately hasn't happened. I can't recall who suggested it (a
short article appeared along with it's first appearence. The idea was,
items of "hard interest" to FidoNet sysops etc -- policy changes (sic),
technical issues, etc, would appear there, so that people utterly
offended by the rest of FidoSnooze could simply check the T of C, and
see if there's anything of interest. Unfortunately, there's only been
two entries in it that I can recall. As much as I like the concept, I
will drop this "feature" unless someone starts send stuff to put in it.


Well I guess that's all for this week. Ta.

Software Versions Update
By David French, 1:103/250
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To inform you all of a very important change, this is why I have
written.

The Telegraph Station BBS,  Home of the Comprehensive Version
List, has changed it's FidoNet Node Number.

The Old Number was 1:103/950

The New Number is  1:103/250

Please note that all update and addition requests for the version
list must now be directed to 1:103/250, as 1:103/950 will be dropped
from the nodelist, possibly by Friday(11/22).

Please make a note of this!!!!!!!

Thanks...

A View from the Outside
by Jonathan Guy, 1:116/33, 1:116/31

 A brief word of introduction: I have been modeming for 2 years, was a
sysop about a quarter of that. (I'm not anymore) I read FidoNews on a
fairly regular basis, and consider myself pretty conversant with the net
and its "politics." This is about the third time I've actually sat down
to write an article for FidoNews, and if you are reading this, I guess I
finished it. The one thing I want to make clear in this article is
basically that this net and its policies are ridiculous. This is not a
flame and I hope no one will take it as such. Any group that can take a
simple, reasonably enjoyable hobby and turn it into an accurate mirror
of society to the point that it has it's own "power politics" has to be
taking the whole business too far. In the time I've been involved in the
net and modeming in general I've seen people threatened with expulsion
for not taking their system down during ZMH, I've seen power hungry (as
if there was any real power in the net at all) *Cs, and I've even seen
(and even made a couple of times) complicated legal arguments on whether
or not FidoNet policy allows handles, something that's been around much
longer than the net. The basic problem with the system is the fact that
you people have seemingly decided that in order to run this thing you
have to have a system of rules that rivals that of most governments. So,
having said all this, I have a few constructive comments to make.
FidoNews 8-46                  Page 3                      18 Nov 1991


 First, and this will make quite a few people mad, eliminate Policy 4.
Don't replace it with some quasi-legalistic WorldPol, you have that, or
at least the beginnings of it, already. Just get rid of it. I am aware
that this will cause problems. I am aware that this will create some
unfair situations in places. Usenet has been living with this since
before FidoNet was even thought of. The problem with creating something
like the current Policy is that it forms a group that has, or at least
is perceived to have, power over the rest of the group. The *Cs are, for
the most part, a group of people that revel in having some kind of power
over their peers. That is why they are *Cs. Eliminate Policy 4 and you
eliminate the ruling class. If you have no policy and no Coordinator
structure all you need is routing hubs. Wait!! Isn't that what the
coordinator structure is supposed to be doing in the first place?

 Second, switch the focus of FidoNet from netmail to echomail. This is
so obvious that I really don't know why no one's done it yet. I have
never known some poor sysop to say "Hey, why don't I join FidoNet so I
can send private messages to other sysops?" The only reason FidoNet has
grown to it's current size is because of echomail, and yet the
conferences still enjoy second-class status. Read Policy 4 very
carefully. Did you ever notice that you can't exchange echomail during
ZMH? Why not? How many people truly need an hour to exchange private
messages? It would seem that the time would be much better spent
transferring the stuff that the users (remember them?) actually read.

 Third, finally, and most important, stop taking yourselves so
seriously!! I can't think of a single person whose livelihood depends on
whether the netmail gets through, yet FidoNet has created an entire
miniature society that judges a person's worth by how quickly they get
the mail. (Think about it: who gets the mail first, you or your NC?)
FidoNet is good. FidoNet is a decent hobby. FidoNet is a HOBBY. FidoNet
is not, and should not be, the focus of someone's entire existence. In
case someone's forgotten, the basic purpose of computer networks is to
facilitate the quick spread of information. Don't you think that perhaps
imposing a power structure and time restrictions on this spread reduces
its speed? I'd imagine that 99% of all FidoNet sysops would be perfectly
willing to dispense with all the extra baggage the head honchos of the
net have added to this process if they could still get the echos.
Unfortunately, if anyone passes a Fido echo to someone outside of the
net they are themselves kicked out, forcing them to either try to rejoin
or find someone else willing to give the "black market" echos. Black
Market?? Aren't these supposed to be free? Isn't this an amateur
network? This is just one example of the kind of thing FidoNet has done.
If you restrict who reads the information you also restrict the feedback
you can get on it. Which is more important, power or knowledge? Someone
needs to rethink their priorities.

 Well, it's felt good to be on the soapbox for a bit. I hope something
will come of this article, but I rather doubt it. I imagine those
FidoNet sysops who actually bother to read this publication will simply
say, "Oh, another nut who thinks he can make things better." Let me let
those people in on a little secret: I CAN'T make things better. They
can. Maybe the powers that ain't (the so-called "grunt sysops" of
FidoNet) can find some sense buried within them. Stop complaining and do
something. Try to remember why you joined this net. Were you looking for
anything like what exists now? Were the people who started it looking
FidoNews 8-46                  Page 4                      18 Nov 1991


for this? If you are a mamber of the coordinator structure you may have
been offended by this article. That's fine. Respond. Do it in a
reasonable way, and don't flame me or someone who agrees with me. Most
of all, think about it. Are you acting like the president of a bananna
republic? If you are, should you be? Lest we forget, this is supposed to
be fun.

                      Assorted Non-Backbone Echoes:
               Medieval group, Contracts, Frugality, etc.

This article is basically an advertisement for several echoes that are not
available on the backbone, that you might be interested in.

First is the Medieval set, about the hobby of medieval re-creation.  It
includes Medieval, Bardic, Heralds, and rec.org.sca, plus a few regional
("kingdom" and "barony" level) echoes.  These will almost certainly NOT be
going backbone, ever.  The differences between them are that:

- Medieval includes lots of chatter, etc. on all topics remotely related
to medievalism.  It caters to ALL such groups and individuals, including
the Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA), Medieval Studies and
Re-creation (MSR, aka Kingdom of Acre), Markland Medieval Mercenary
Militia, Dark Horde (both "New" and "Classic"), Dagorhir, Darkon, and so
on, though the SCA is the largest influence.  It allows (as the others do
not) use of handles other than your regular login name; in fact, this is
encouraged if your login name is not medieval-sounding.  It is hubbed and
moderated by myself, who started it in 1988 with Andrew Adler.  The
traffic averages 15 to 20 msgs/day, which includes traffic from GT-Net and
WWIVnet.  The latest list can be requested here as MED_LST.ARC.

- rec.org.sca is much more scholarly and focused (irrelevant chatter is
frowned upon).  It is a newsgroup imported from Usenet.  (Create dupe
loops at your own peril!)  As the name implies, it focuses on the Society
for Creative Anachronism.  It is moderated by someone in Usenet (details
available on request).  Traffic averages about 200-300 messages a week...
but usually dumped all at once, due to a sporadic gateway.

- Bardic is even more focused.  It is a mailing list imported from
Internet, about the "bardic arts", including composing and performing
songs, stories, poems, and so forth.  It is moderated by someone in
Usenet.  Traffic is nearly dead, perhaps one or two messages per week.

- Heralds is also tightly focused.  It is a fusion of a mailing list
imported from Internet, and an echo that existed by itself before the
fusion.  It is about Heraldry, the study of "coats of arms" and such
things, mainly as practiced in the SCA, but sometimes also in reality as
well.  (SCA heraldry is patterned mainly after 14th Century English
heraldry, and heraldic practices from other times and places may vary
widely.)  It is moderated by someone in Usenet and Joe Bethancourt of
114/29 (who started the echo about a year ago).  Traffic averages about 4
messages per day.

FidoNews 8-46                  Page 5                      18 Nov 1991


Since you must be "emailable" from Internet to participate in Internet
mailing lists and newsgroups, only node numbers from networks that have
arranged gating or forwarding of Internet mail may appear in these last
three.  As far as I know, that means only Fidonet (at least as far as
Fidonet-style networks go).

Next is the Contracts echo.  This is intended to be for consultants and
contractors, what Jobs-Now is for those looking for "regular" jobs.  The
SOLE acceptable postings are announcements of consulting or contracting
openings, and announcements about the echo from the moderator (me).  We
currently have several nodes in the Washington DC area, one in Portland OR
(105/54, Jobs BBS), one in Houston TX (106/1999, Radio Free Houston), and
one in Harrisburg PA (270/711, M.A.R.C. Information System).  It has
information on contracts all over the world, mostly imported from the
Usenet newsgroup misc.jobs.contract.  If there is enough interest and
traffic to justify it (currently averaging one to two messages per day),
this one might go backbone.

And finally, the Frugality echo.  The name pretty much says it all.  For
those of you without a dictionary, that's "how to be cheap" but put more
politely.  It is moderated by its originator, Dot Hage (whom some of you
may remember as Dot Falcon, of NERFFREE fame) at 109/530.  Outside the
Washington DC area (net 109), where it is distributed via the local
backbone, the only other point I know of is in Hurricane WV.  If there is
enough interest and traffic (currently two to three messages per day),
this one too might go backbone.

Other interesting non-backbone echoes include Intertel (about that club),
Ilians (a term designating members of Intertel; all may read, but only
members may write in or carry the echo), and Mensans_Only (Mensans is a
term meaning members of Mensa; the restrictions are analogous to those on
Ilians), but my connection with those is slimmer and they are growing
well, so I will leave their hyping to their moderators....

I carry all of the above, and will hold them for anybody to pick up - I am
HST and v.32 capable, and PC-Pursuitable.

                    Announcing SEAmail version 1.01

System Enhancement Associates, Inc. is pround to announce the
availability of SEAmail version 1.01, the next generation of PC-based
electronic mail.  SEAmail is the end result of a two year development
effort involving tens of thousands of manhours of design, development,
and testing, delivering to you a superior product with features and
performance unmatched by any other software.  Where authors of other
FidoNews 8-46                  Page 6                      18 Nov 1991


products have declaired things to be impossible, SEA has achieved them
anyway.

Here are just a few of the advanced features provided by SEAmail:

  * Domain addressing with direct access to multiple domains.  No more
    fussing with trying to paste together multiple node lists.  Use
    them all directly and call anyone you want!

  * Automatic aliasing on messages and packets.  Never again hear
    people complain about you using the wrong address on a message or
    on a call.  SEAmail handles your addresses for you and
    automatically uses the right one.

  * Multiple session types (including Wazoo and FAX) under your direct
    control.  Add new capability to your system!

  * On-the-fly incremental packing and integrated GroupMail
    processing.  In-transit mail you receive can be repacked for
    delivery or pickup immediately.

  * Automatic grouping of multiple addresses.  If you have messages
    for five different addresses that are all really the same person,
    they all go in one packet.  If you've been told that can't be done
    without a special type of session, don't you believe it!  SEAmail
    can do it in ANY type of session.

  * Enhanced security.  Other software gives you "curmudgeon mode".
    SEAmail just starts there.  With SEAmail you can require session
    passwords on all calls or just a few, you can use message
    encryption passwords to ensure the privacy of routed messages, and
    you can use Caller*ID to further enhance system security.

  * Multiple line and multiple modem support.  Maximize your system
    availability and throughput by taking and placing calls on many
    phone lines at once!

All this and more can be yours!  We have redesigned network mail from
the ground up to give you an electronic mail system with powers and
abilities far beyond those of other systems.  Don't believe people who
tell you it can't be done -- watch SEAmail do it!


Get SEAmail and see just how powerful a mail system can be!

Voice mailboxes will soon be available for rent by Fidonet Sysops
in the New York metropolitan area according to the Sysop of
1:278/729.

The voice mail system allows each mailbox owner to remotely retrieve
mail, change greetings, receive/forward faxes, forward messages,
and greet callers in the owner's voice. In addition, outbound
messages can also be initiated by the system.

If you are a Fidonet Sysop in the New York area and wish to
receive more information, contact the Sysop at 1;278/729 via email.

 This world's chill and damp and drear. Our plight
 Like Sisyphus to push uphill all day
 And stop to see it roll down and away.
 Each with our little secrets this cold night
 We weary, turn, then see a welcome sight:
 Of warmth and friendship - shelter for each stray -
 An open door and a safe place to stay.
 (Where Holly serves up drinks for free each night.)
 Come in and meet the crew - there's Max who's Mad,
 There's Rebel, Cherry, Woody, and Nitehawk,
 A Tiger (Black), two wolves called Z and Vlad,
 And many many others come to talk.
 To talk and share and laugh a little while,
 And chance a glance at J'mes to see him smile.
