                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================

                            Seeing is Believing

     So  you've gotten into network mail.  Maybe not directly -- maybe
     you're mainly into echomail.  Regardless,  you've  found  youself
     interacting with all sorts of people you've never met before.  In
     fact, you STILL haven't met them.

     Maybe you've sent them messages,  and maybe  you  haven't.  Maybe
     you've  just  been  reading messages they have written.  Some you
     like,  and some you hate.  Either way,  you think you know  them.
     But you don't.  Not really.

     An example: I went to a local area sysop meeting not long ago and
     met  a  great many people that I had previously known through the
     network.  One guy in particular sat off in the corner, watching a
     monitor.  A few people took turns at a  keyboard,  typing.  Turns
     out  they  were  typing a running commentary about what was going
     on.  You see,  he was deaf,  and couldn't hear a word of what was
     happening  around  him.  I  knew him already from netmail,  but I
     never  respected  him  half so much as I did once I found out the
     hardships he was dealing with.  I also know more about the people
     who took turns at that keyboard,  and respect them all  the  more
     for it.

     Another example: At a local sysop meeting I met a guy with whom I
     had  earlier  come  to  blows  on  one conference or another.  On
     meeting him and talking with him,  I realized that there was much
     more than met the eye.  I understand him better now, and messages
     from  him  that  before  would have piqued my ire now cause me to
     pause and think.

     Electronic mail as a means  of  communications  has  some  severe
     shortcomings,  but  many  of  them  can be alleviated by a little
     personal contact.  Your big chance of  the  year  to  meet  those
     people you've been hearing from is coming up soon.  On  the  next
     to  last weekend of August is our big annual get-together,  being
     held this time in Washington DC.  Please don't miss  out  on  it.
     We'll be looking forward to seeing you there.

     In response to over 147 messages I have run the  benchmark  tests
     again, this time including Zoo in the testing. I thank all of you
     for  your  suggestions and have incorporated most of them in this
     current test.


     Computer Configuration
     ----------------------

     Panasonic Sr.  Partner running at 4.77 Mhz (Norton SI  1.0)  with
     640k  of  Ram  with  a  20 Meg Mini-scribe hard disk.  My current
     configuration is as follows:

         A) Buffers      = 35
         B) Files        = 20
         C) Stacks       = 10,128
         D) Cluster Size = 1k

     I hope this helps the people who asked what I ran  the  tests  on
     and what configuration I used during the tests.


     Test File Information
     ---------------------

     The  tests were run against a collection of 17 files with a total
     length of 291134 bytes.  This averages out  to  a  file  size  of
     17125.53  bytes  per  file.  The  files  used are a collection of
     'com',  'exe',  'txt' and  'ovl'  files.  I  can  make  the  disk
     available for anyone who desires to see it.

     The  tests  were run on the hard drive this time and the disk was
     optimized (disk optimizer)  between  tests  to  assure  the  most
     accurate results possible.

     All  tests  were run three (3) times and the times reported below
     are the average of the three test runs.

     Please note in the first article several weeks ago the files were
     read in from the floppy drive and the archive was produced on the
     hard drive.

     In this series of tests the files were read from the  hard  drive
     and the archives were produced on the hard drive.


     Versions Of Software Tested
     ---------------------------

     The following versions of software were used in this test and are
     FidoNews 4-21                Page 3                    1 Jun 1987


     the latest versions to the best of my knowledge.

         Arc     - Version 5.20
         Pkarc   - Version 3.50
         Zoo     - Version 1.41


     Actual Test Results - Creation Of Archive Files
     -----------------------------------------------

         Software        Time (mm:ss:hh)    File Size Created
         ----------------------------------------------------
         Arc                07:02:41           199956
         Pkarc              01:12:90           195015
         Zoo                02:20:64           197753
         ----------------------------------------------------


     Actual Test Results - Unpacking Of Archive Files

         ----------------------------------------------------
         Software        Time (mm:ss:hh)
         ----------------------------------------------------
         Arc                04:14:39
         Arce               01:05:28
         Pkxarc             00:50:17
         Zoo                01:15:93


     Percentage Of Size Reduction As Reported By Software

         -----------------------------------------------------
         Software   Source Size   Arc Size  Percentage Smaller
         -----------------------------------------------------
         Arc        291134        199956    32%
         Pkarc      291134        195015    34%
         Zoo        291134        197753    32%
         -----------------------------------------------------

     Again these numbers are what the software reported as the source,
     output and percentage of reduction.


     Self Extraction    Creation - Extraction Results

         -----------------------------------------------------
         Software      Creation Time      Extraction Time
         -----------------------------------------------------
         Pkarc         01:09:09           00:57:89
         -----------------------------------------------------

     Although  Arc is now distributed as a self extracting archive the
     creation program is not distributed with Arc, as it is with Pkarc
     so Arc could not be tested in this area.


     FidoNews 4-21                Page 4                    1 Jun 1987


     So Which One Should I Use?
     --------------------------

     Although Pkarc is faster and produces smaller archive files there
     is one small problem in its exclusive use.

     Currently Arc  is  not  compatible  with  the  files  that  Pkarc
     produces.  So  if  you  use  Pkarc  I suggest you create self un-
     packing archives or some how inform the people  that  might  have
     access to your archives that you use Pkarc as well as Arc.

     As a Sysop I use Pkarc because it produces smaller files and thus
     saves  valuable  disk  space.  I  am  currently in the process of
     converting my arc files to self-extracting  files  thus  avoiding
     the  question  of  which  utility  to  use  when un-arcing a file
     downloaded from my system.

     An interesting feature  of  the  Pkarc  self  extraction  is  the
     possiblities it creates for software distribution.

     By  this  I  mean  that  a  self-extracting  archive  or group of
     archives in conjunction with a batch file could  make  installing
     software easier in some cases.

     With  considerable respect I wag my finger disapprovingly at  the
     network of Fido boards.  Don't get me wrong; it's not what exists
     that  irks  me but what is missing.   However,  before I  go  any
     further allow me introduce myself and my background.

     I am an old fossil, gas bag, traditional wooden boat builder.  My
     ancestors  have  been tormenting cedars,  oaks,  elms  and  other
     defenseless  life  forms into artificial shapes  for  generations
     with  only  minor changes in method,  style,  or  flexibility  of
     opinion.   I am,  in effect, a dinosaur, a creature of an earlier
     age.

     For  me  the  echoes  of the distant past  and  present  are  not
     separated by well defined boundaries of epoch,  nation,  or clan.
     Rather,  each  segment of time appears as well worn shelves  from
     which  to draw tools.   It is not uncommon to find a broad ax and
     computer resting comfortably side by side on my cluttered  bench.
     Both posses a cutting edge, one no keener than the other.

     Morning  may  find  me hunched over,  wielding an  ax  like  some
     neolithic brute;  satisfying wack wacks resound through the shop.
     If  you  listen  carefully you can hear the  blows  echo  through
     hundreds of centuries.

     The  afternoon buzzes to the whine of a bandsaw chewing through a
     plank.   Echoes here are juvenile,  spanning less than a  hundred
     years.

     Evenings  are spent peering into my computers trying to meld  the
     shapes  of  the  past into a being that will  give  pleasure  and
     utility of graceful motion.  Here, the infantile echos are barely
     heard at all.

     The  most ancient echos are the chatter of voices discussing  and
     arguing the sense and form of wood and metal.   They are building
     a HER --- not a thing but a being.  Boats are known as HER or SHE
     simply   because  boat  builders  have  always  worship   curves.
     Stressed  and contesting angles are heresy --- worse,  obscenity.
     How  could  the gentle grace of a well-formed craft  be  anything
     other than SHE?    Her future status as a BEING is framed, not in
     her  shape   but  in  her  evolved  history.   There  is  nothing
     proprietary about a traditional wooden boat;  each is founded  on
     the  existence  of her predecessor,  evolved not  invented.   The
     echoing voices are not aware in these terms, but every act, every
     action   is framed by this concept.   The echoes here are  vastly
     older than our kind -- as old as evolution.

     It  was with this sense of continuity that I purchased  my  first
     computer about nine years ago.   My patterns where driving me out
     of  my shop.  I would either have to build a large shed or find a
     better way to store them.   A computer seemed the ideal solution.
     Eight years and dozens of different of types of systems later odd
     looking  contraptions  laying disemboweled  on  work  benches.  I
     operated  an  S-100 based RCP/M for public domain and  commercial
     hacks  and  more money in my equipment and software than  in  the
     bank -- in other words, the whole nine yard cliche.

     I had fallen in love with the IDEA of remote systems.   Here  was
     tradition  at  its best.   Yes tradition!   Each  board  operated
     independently but everything within was cooperative, evolved from
     what came before.  Ward Christensen, Paul Traina, Erving Hoff and
     countless others produced magnificent hacks,  free to all.  ZCPR,
     BYE,  XMODEM,  MDM7##  and hundreds of other utilities formed the
     backbone of RCP/M systems.   Each a separate module but framed to
     act as a whole.

     The vast majority of this software was in source.   One man would
     originated a given utility but many worked to polish and improve.
     Bounced from board to board, embellished with care and passed on,
     they  grew in power and flexibility far beyond their  beginnings.
     Though they improved at the hands of others, their founders where
     never forgotten.  The top of each application was rich in bylines
     and comments reflecting its lineage and fascinating to read.

     There was only one thing missing, a networking mail system.  When
     I  found out about FidoNet I could barley control my  excitement.
     The  missing  ingredient necessary for an electronic  world  wide
     community of shared ideas was finally here!   Though my old S-100
     based RCP/M was functioning faithfully I gave it an  affectionate
     pat and closed it down.  I Installed in its place a PC clone with
     two  thirty-two meg hard disks and began collecting the necessary
     software.

     To my dismay I discovered that the PC family of BBS programs  and
     support utilities where not a step forward in possibilities,  but
     rather a disappointing step backwards.  By this I don't mean that
     MS  Dos  systems lack in imaginative ideas,  far  from  it.   The
     problem  is  that  each  competes rather than  cooperates  in  an
     evolving whole.

     Fido  for  example  is one  monolithic  piece,  its  source  code
     proprietary  and unavailable to its users.   Fido is a  brilliant
     program   but  one  man  could  not  be  expected  to  accomplish
     everything.  My board supports more than one operating system; if
     I could segregate CP/M and MS Dos users though the use of a  menu
     of operating systems the board would be much less confusing.   As
     it  is,  users are exposed to a vast list of bewildering choices.
     If I had the source code I could rewrite what was appropriate  to
     my users needs.  Now,  my only choice is to write an entirely new
     board -- not a pleasant prospect!

     Even  if  I had fido's soruce code it still wouldn't resolve  the
     most important issue,  modular design.  In RCP/M systems the user
     FidoNews 4-21                Page 7                    1 Jun 1987


     IS  allowed within the operating system.   CP/M's soruce code  is
     available  to all and can be easily modified so that  destructive
     commands will answer ONLY to the sysop.

     Unlike  Fido  the RCP/M message system,  file  transfer  utility,
     elaborate  help  routines,   and  many  more  are  in   separate,
     independent,  and,  most  important,  modifiable  modules.   This
     approach  allows for VERY powerful and friendly systems.   XMODEM
     and  KMD are file transfer utilities in that  tradition.   Fido's
     transfer   system  is  clever  and  versatile  allowing   several
     protocals.  XMODEM and KMD do not possess KERMIT but they do have
     something  even  better,  they can transfer just  one  file  from
     within  a  library of files without having to send you the  whole
     thing if you don't want it.

     In  a  single  monolithic program there is  just  so  much  room,
     cooperating  modules  are another mater.   Signing on to  a  good
     RCP/M is like entering a spacious library,  one is free to wonder
     through countless shelves.   Any volume may be withdrawn whole or
     in part.  In contrast, entering Fido's cramped nooks and crannies
     is both frustrating and limiting.  Please forgive me; the problem
     is  not  that  Fido is too small but that it's  too  large.   The
     application's  brilliance is due solely to its  mail  system.  It
     should  have  been confined to that,  or at least broken up  into
     parts.

                          What I Think is Needed

     A  patch  to  MS/PC Dos that would turn  off  and,  on  dangerous
     commands such as DEL,  MKDIR,  RENAME, and the like, operate only
     with  a password selected by the sysop.   The utility would  also
     ascribe security- level clearances to given directories based  on
     references  within  a  file,  much as Fido does  now.   In  RCP/M
     systems this program is usually ZCPR or ZCMD, they are patches to
     the CCP.   I imagine that a modified COMMAND.COM would be all  it
     would take to accomplish this.  Another more powerful possibility
     would  be  a high memory overseer running all other  applications
     within its shell.

     A  utility  that answers the phone,  determines  the  baud  rate,
     identifies the caller, patches its findings into high memory or a
     file  and  then links the caller to the message system  would  be
     helpful.   RCP/M  systems call this utility BYE.   The reason for
     the  name BYE is so that when the polite user calls its  name  it
     gives the length of time on,  number of up and down loaded files,
     and  anything  else  the sysop might like to remind the  user  of
     before  sign off.  In many ways BYE resembles WATCHDOG or  GUARD.
     If  simultaneous  callers are to be supported this would  be  the
     only application that need understand it.

     The message system could be VERY powerful because it would not be
     burdened with any other responsibilities other than messages.  It
     defiantly should not contain the actual network mail  algorithms,
     only  flags  for  the  mail mover  to  access.   Because  of  its
     compactness  true word processing features could be employed  and
     governed  by  terminal  definition files flagged  to  the  user's

     machine.   If  the  users machine was not on the list he  or  she
     would  either  have to download them or be satisfied with  lesser
     capabilities.    Actually,   it  is  fairly  easy  to  obtain   a
     comprehensive list,  most programmers possess fifty or more.  One
     feature that I feel is a must: an automatic search-through on all
     messages  areas for the users mail at sign on!   I was astonished
     that Fido didn`t possess this ability.

     A utility,  much like OUTSIDE,  linked by the message system  and
     possessing  a  sysop supplied menu of applications,  including  a
     gateway to the protected operating system, should be added.

     Also  include  an  independent  file  transfer  utility  that  is
     accessed  from  within the protected  operating  system.   Fido's
     transfer  algorithms are GREAT but they should  be  outside,  not
     inside Fido.   Further,  they SHOULD be able to extract any given
     file from within an archive or library.  The RCP/M uses XMODEM or
     KMD to accomplish this.

     RCP/M  systems employ scores of useful utilities:  extensive help
     system;  MAP to display files within the system;  FILE or FIND to
     locate files; LDIR to display the contents of a library; LTYPE to
     display ASCII files within a library, and many more.  Because the
     user  has access to the operating system,  independent  utilities
     can be robust, instead of crowded within one large program.

     The mail system MUST be independent in the fashion of SeaDOG  but
     it  should  also  be protected from users  within  the  operating
     system.   The  simplest way to do that is place it in a protected
     area  graded  by  the proposed patch to Dos or  the  high  memory
     shell.

     Most  important of all,  each and every module MUST be in  source
     and  the  code  as  portable  as  possible!    Systems  may  vary
     considerably but the file structure of messages and the  protocol
     of the mail system MUST remain universally compatible.   For this
     reason,  as  well  as  others,  an international  coordinator  of
     standards,  much  like the French Academy of Language,  needs  be
     established.   The  International FidoNet Association is  already
     established and a logical candidate.

     FidoNet  is a wonderful idea but it is far too  parochial.   Fido
     acts  as  though IBM and its clones where the  only  systems  out
     there.   Years  ago  I  called my board Critical Mass  because  I
     believed  that  enough  minds  working  in  concert  produce   an
     explosion of ideas and insights.  I believe this still. We are in
     desperate NEED of a few insights!   There are countless thousands
     of  boards supporting hundreds of thousands of users world  wide.
     What  an opportunity!   What a potential tradition!   Restricting
     this  potential  to a handful of segregated  boards,  borders  on
     criminal negligence!

     Anyone  out  there  know  how  to  protect  Dos?   How  about  an
     independent utility supporting KERMIT,  XMODEM, YMODEM, and ASCII
     file transfer?

     for a TRULY international collection of minds.   I am beating the

     >>I WAKE UP AND CHECK THE MAIL BOX<<

     What do I find from our friendly net? flames, hurt feelings, more
     flames.  So what do I do? I flame of course, isn't that what
     BBS's is all about?

     >>I QUICKLY WRITE A MESSAGE TO THE NET SYSOPS<<

     What, has everything gotten so boring that all we can do is poke
     jabs at each other.  As usual I screwed up by correcting previous
     mistakes.  So what happens, Bill does nothing other than run his
     board and gets blamed for my mistake.  So what, who cares, what
     the f*ck.

     Another case in point,  Dan offers to help with the echo mail but
     in the mean time John is coordinating with Seattle to get
     echomail for us for free.  Randy sends an abrupt message to Dan
     (yes Randy, you do get abrupt) and Dan get's pissed.

     Now comes the statement that gets everyone pissed at me.  So now
     everyone is throwing tantrums (you know, like the ones our
     children throw). Oh lets not be reasonable, and lets be sure not
     to re read those quick messages we drop in the mail, lets be sure
     not to ask ourselves how the other party is going to interpret
     this, lets just do it anyway.

     A lot of you may not know this, but we are considered an
     abnormality to the rest of the Region, we are strange, we don't
     bicker, we don't have nasty politics, we get along.  Well it's
     nice to know that has changed, we aren't abnormal any more, were
     getting just as f*cked up as everyone else.

     I don't know why but for some reason I don't feel any better.


     Bill

     >>LATER THAT DAY<<


     Well my hot little mis-spelling little fingers have cooled down a
     bit.

     You know, when this type of crap happens I ask myself "Bill, why
     do you run a BBS?" and since I usually get good answers from
     myself, I generally reply "Because it's fun."

     Now comes the hard part and what I believe is different for each
     of us.  I ask myself (yes, I really do talk to myself) "what
     makes it fun?"  Well that's a hard question to answer.  I
     generally find it easier to think of the things that don't lend
     enjoyment to it.

     First of all it's a GAME, and like all good games you need
     players.  To me this means both other sysops and USERS.  Now a
     BBS without users isn't much fun is it? and without fellow
     FidoNews 4-21                Page 11                   1 Jun 1987


     syslops to share (and be competitive) with there isn't as much
     fun.

     On the subject of sysops, the reason I got tired of the national
     echo's was that there weren't any USERS, just sysops, and you
     know what were like.

     Another thing that limits the fun of running a bbs is letting it
     get stagnate. I don't know about the rest of you but I have to
     tweak my system all the time, make it run faster, make it
     cleaner, make friendlier.  I have to change things around, not to
     make it harder to use, but to make it easier and for the life of
     no matter what I do to it today, tomorrow there will be something
     else.

     The trouble with tweaking is that it usually takes two weeks to
     fix the bugs created while solving other problems. This generally
     creates havoc else where, like on your boards.  Well I'm sorry
     about that, but even us gods make screw ups.

     Now I also ask myself (see I'm still doing it) what should I do
     when someone else screws up while working on their board (are you
     listening J M), like finding a couple of hundred messages out of
     the blue and where I don't want them.  Ah the first thought is to
     grab a shotgun, how dare he mess my system up. (Yes Randy, I'll
     loan you one of my shotguns for the next time I do it to you) or
     do I drop him a note, or place a voice call to let him know
     something went wrong.

     And heaven forbid the same mistake be made the next night, how
     can anyone be so incompetent that they don't instantly forgo
     dinner, tell the kids to shut up, kiss the wife (if she's still
     talking to you) and spend the entire evening tracking down the
     fact that you have VANPORT and CALENDAR reversed in your
     areas#.bbs

     I guess what all this babbling is about is the job is only worth
     doing if you have fun doing it.  Like even writing this note I
     using DUTCHED, it still writes the same note, but it does it
     differently and that's fun.  When's the last time any of you took
     the trouble to join in the conversations your users have started?
     Well I can tell you that's fun, when's the last time you designed
     a new log on screen?  That's fun to.  There are so many ways to
     enjoy ourselves with these little pieces of software that I can't
     imagine trying to have UN-FUN.

     We all have our own areas of expertise, why not be creative, make
     mistakes, even make a mess (I remember when I thought I didn't
     have fun if my mother didn't have to cut the dirty clothes off
     me).  Make your BBS a great BBS and help make your fellow sysops
     board a great one as well.  Lets help each other, not attack.
     Remember that you can't see the face on the other end, you can't
     see if he's smiling as he say that, or not, so lets assume that
     he is.

     >>THE NEXT DAY<<

     It was suggested that I share my little tirade with all of you,
     so I combined the two notes, corrected many spelling errors (and
     a little bad grammar), and submit not for your approval but for
     your reflection.

     I'll close with a quick question (or 3).  Is this fun anymore?
     Why isn't it? (assuming you answered the first one honestly).
     And lastly, What can I do to make it fun again?

          I'm going  to hit  some unusual  items this  time around. By
     unusual I mean something that is  not piece  of computer hardware
     or  software.  It  is  something  that  every hacker (in the true
     meaning, not the current media distorted meaning) should own, and
     almost  anyone  who  is  programming  (or learning to program) in
     assembly language or C (maybe Pascal as well, I'm not sure). This
     column may  turn out  to be  a little short as well. I just got a
     new machine at work with a 1.2 meg  floppy and  my home machine's
     360K floppy  does not get along with it at all. Since I often put
     part of this column together during my lunch break, this  poses a
     minor problem.

     -- Casio CM-100 (list price ???, mine cost about $20) --

          In the  beginning there  was assembly  language. Then due to
     the monumental efforts of many  people  there  came  BASIC. While
     this was  fine for  those who  didn't feel like learning assembly
     language, it was bad for those  who still  thought in  terms like
     LDA. Many  did not  forsake these  adventurers however, TI made a
     calculator especially for them  that included  all their favorite
     operations (like  AND, XOR,  etc) in  all the myriad number bases
     (Hex, Octal, Binary, and lowly  Decimal).  The  only  problem was
     that TI  wanted an  exorbitant amount of money for this wonderful
     device (at least I  always found  it out  of my  price range). So
     things stood  for many a year. While the "mainstream" of computer
     users went over to applications, many  still programmed  in their
     beloved  assembly  language.  While  the TI calculator would have
     been nice, they  were  forced  to  use  their  computers  do this
     wonderful  work  (needlessly  complicating  their  debugging). So
     things stood  until a  few months  ago when  Casio announced that
     they  had  not  forsaken  the  programmers,  and  here  is  a new
     calculator that does all that the TI model does and is within all
     peoples budgets.  The great corporation named this device the CM-
     100, and it was made widely available.

          Like the previous paragraph? My mom always did want me to go
     into  preaching,  problem  was  someone  had  already written the
     bible! It's kind of a biblical  description of  my experiences in
     assembly language  programming (I  did a little work in 6502 with
     my first  computer.  No,  it  wasn't  a  Commodore).  Many  of us
     familiar with  low-level languages  have run  into the problem of
     coping with the unusual functions and number bases  involved with
     programming  in  these  languages.  Be  honest,  how many hex-dec
     conversion programs or  "programmer's  calculator"  programs have
     you seen over the years? I know I've seen a few, and written some
     from scratch on occasion.  The problem  I always  ran into  was I
     FidoNews 4-21                Page 14                   1 Jun 1987


     only had  one computer  and couldn't  run my non-debugged program
     and my calculator program at the same time (this was  before TSRs
     became available).  Texas Instruments  did make a calculator that
     was ideal for this type  of  work,  the  problem  was  I couldn't
     justify spending  over eighty dollars on it. These problems ended
     a few months back I came across an ad in one of  my magazines for
     a new  Casio calculator.  From the ad's picture I could tell that
     it did all the  great things  the TI  calculator did,  and the ad
     claimed  prices  under  twenty-five  dollars.  I  quickly started
     calling up the retail stores in the area, and soon  came across a
     discount store  that had them in stock (they were even on sale!).
     Since the calculator has proven itself useful, I thought I'd pass
     on my discovery.

          The Casio  CM-100 (or  Computer Math  Calc) has two modes of
     operation, the normal calculator mode and the computer math mode.
     While  some  operations  can  be  carried  across  between  modes
     (memory,  +/-,  parentheses)  many   can't   (square   root,  hms
     conversions, shift,  rotate). Unless  otherwise stated everything
     from here on is going to  deal with  the computer  math mode. You
     have your  choice of  bit size  for all operations. The available
     bit sizes are 1, 4,  8,  16  and  32  bits.  I've  found  this to
     adequate for  almost all  of my  needs. It's capable of using the
     binary, octal,  decimal and  hexidecimal base  numbers and mixing
     the number  bases in an equation. For example what is 76d+8ah-32o
     in binary, with the CM-100  the  I  have  the  answer  in seconds
     (10111100  binary).  You  could  also  use  it  do  quick  number
     conversions. People who are debugging programs will have  use for
     its more  computer oriented  math functions  like AND (4 AND 4 is
     not 8 believe it or not),  OR, eXclusive  OR, and  NOT. It's also
     capable of shifting and rotating the bits.

          While the you can only look at 8-10 digits at a time (varies
     by number base), the  calculator  is  keeping  track  of complete
     number.  Casio  uses  a  combination  of  the BLK key and up to 3
     decimal points to let you  know  what  part  of  a  number you're
     looking  at.   If  the   number  you're  trying  to  look  at  is
     10110011100011110000111110000011 and you see .1.0.000011 you know
     that  it's  displaying  the  least  significant  (or  right most)
     digits. If it's showing  .1000111.1. you  know that  you have one
     set of  8 bits  to the  left and two sets of 8 bits to the right.
     The decimal points show how many "blocks" are to each side of the
     number. Please note that these decimal points only show up in the
     octal or  binary displays.  The decimal  and hexadecimal displays
     are capable of showing all of the digits at one time.

          The calculator is capable of signed and unsigned arithmetic,
     so it is reasonably  flexible. One  of the  drawbacks is  that it
     can't  handle  numbers  greater  than  32  bits  in size (maximum
     unsigned integer of 4,294,967,295 decimal). While  this may sound
     like  a  lot,  I  remember  some  of  my  college  classes on 370
     assembler and it's 64 bit  results  in  multiplication.  The only
     other drawback  that I have with it is that it doesn't understand
     floating point numbers  or  any  of  the  other  strange  ways of
     representing a number in a computer (packed decimal for example).
     Since I've  always  tried  to  avoid  floating  point  numbers in
     FidoNews 4-21                Page 15                   1 Jun 1987


     assembler (granted  I haven't done much with 8088 assembler yet),
     it has been sufficient  for 80-90%  of my  work. If  nothing else
     it's an  easy way for a beginning Computer Science student to get
     an A on their first exam  in  their  class  on  assembly language
     (which is  usually convert  these numbers  to different bases and
     perform an AND, OR,  addition or  subtraction on  these numbers).
     While I  can't condone  using it for this, I do wish I could sell
     them right outside the class on the day of that first exam!

     -- Winding down --

          I'm  still  playing  Silent  Service  from  MicroProse. I've
     gotten up  a few  levels in the past two weeks and am about ready
     to give up on  the higher  reality levels.  I'm getting  tired of
     being destroyed  by depth  charges. One thing I forgot to mention
     in my quick look at it before is the boss key. This  is beginning
     to pop  up in  more and more games. What it basically does is you
     press a certain key and a  "legitimate" screen  pops up.  This is
     meant  for  those  who  insist  on playing games at work and need
     something better than the three finger salute (Ctrl-Alt-Del) when
     the boss  walks in  on them.  This supposedly  helps prevent much
     embarrassment (and help you keep your job). I've  never been that
     tempted to play any games at work, and besides my work machine is
     a monographics machine that  won't work  with most  games. I know
     how an  EGA Wonder  can overcome this problem, but right now that
     card is busy in my home machine.

          I'm still looking for a good LEX for my PC,  so the valspeak
     program is  not yet completed. If I ever do find one, I'm working
     on converting valspeak into  the  type  of  speech  found  in old
     Italian grandmothers.  No disrespect intended here, that's how my
     net host put it and he is going to help in the conversion. Please
     let me  know if  you find  a good Unix LEX for the PC. If it's in
     the Public Domain ever better, although I am  now willing  to buy
     it.  Some  people  on  Usenet  have  been making extensive use of
     valspeak and I've decided I must have it!

          This week you get yet another book on C. This  one is  a lot
     easier to  get through  than the  K&R book I mentioned last week.
     It's the "C Programming Guide Second Edition" by Jack Purdum (Que
     books, list  price $19.95).  One of  "features" of this book that
     many will be thankful  of is  that the  book occasionally  uses a
     comparison  between  the  C  structure  and  BASIC.  Since almost
     everyone has looked at BASIC at  one time  or another,  it may be
     helpful to  those making  the transition  to C  (which I think is
     much  superior  to  BASIC).  Jack  Purdum  starts  off   with  an
     introduction  to  C  (declaring  variables,  braces and such) and
     gradually progresses up to file I/O. Along the way it  covers the
     major structures (if, if-else, loops of varying types, etc.), how
     to write a function, pointers (VERY important in  C), simple I/O.
     Two  chapters  are  dedicated  to  some  of the more unusual data
     types.  The  first   merely   covers   the   extensions   to  the
     "fundamental" data  types (What's  the difference between a short
     and unsigned integer?) while the second chapter covers structures
     and unions.  If you don't have access to a computer, text editor,
     and C compiler beware! Two  underlying  assumptions  of  the book
     FidoNews 4-21                Page 16                   1 Jun 1987


     (given  to  you  in  the  preface)  are that 1) you have to write
     programs to learn a language and 2) if  you can  visualize what a
     statement does, learning it will be easier. This book should work
     as a great introduction before you try and manage the K&R book as
     it explains much more.

          I've  tried  to  avoid  to  much  in  this column as it's my
     thirteenth column and I'm superstitious! It's also been  a little
     short  because  of  the  new difficulties with transporting files
     between my work machine  and  home.  I  welcome  any  comments or
     suggestions on  my column,  one of things I enjoy is hearing from
     you! Below you'll find  my FidoNet  net/node number,  usenet site
     (working on  getting more of a path, thanks to the advice of Marc
     Randolph on 170/220), and US mail address. I'd especially like to
     hear from  those of you who are very satisfied with some piece of
     software or hardware. This has the capability of saving me  a lot
     of time  separating out  the wheat  from the  chaff. Hopefully by
     next week I'll have cleared up the problems  between my  work and
     home machines and this will be a little better. Until then....

     Due  to  a  hardware  glitch,   last  week's  issue  of  FidoNews
     mistakenly  went  out  as volume 5,  number 1 of 25 May 2010.  It
     should have been volume 4,  number 20 of 25  May  1987.  We  have
     corrected  it  here  in  our  archives.  The corrected edition is
     available for download from (201) 472-8065.  Volume  5  number  1
     will be reissued correctly as the first issue of 1988 (we hope).

     or bring it with you when you come to the conference in August.


     These  ballots  will  be counted by myself since with 200 members
     the charges for a CPA would be very high.  Hard  copies  will  be
     made  available  to  anyone wishing to insure that their vote was
     included.

                               Thank You
