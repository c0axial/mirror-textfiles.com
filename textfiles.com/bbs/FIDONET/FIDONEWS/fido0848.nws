Yes, I did it again... I compressed last week's news with LHARC version
2, instead of the older one. More fallout from my swapover to a new
disk. This week should be the right format, sigh.

And thanks to the people who sent me ARTSPEC.DOC. And the historical
files; I got a few dups, but not as many as you'd think, and some came
up with files I'd forgotten about... there's so few copies around, and
so few files in those days to begin with, if you find something
interesting, by all means send me a copy...

There are three things I have promised to do that I have not done as
editor of this here thing: solicit more/better articles, change the
FidoNews file format, and update ARTSPEC.DOC.

In January 1992, I will start producing a new, example format FidoNews.
The current format will remain in distribution, but on filerequests to
1:1/1 for file FIDONEWS, you'll get both copies; this older one and the
new one. Depending on feedback etc, I'll swap in the new one no less
than 8 weeks later, maybe 12 weeks.

Also by that time, I will publish the proposed changes to ARTSPEC.DOC,
that will hopefully handle the cascading responses to controversial
articles, if we ever get any again.

The first item is not so easily resolved. It is Actual Work. I didn't
mean by my offer that YOU the FidoNews Reader were off the hook on this
-- this is supposed to represent the FidoNet, which even the most
flameproof and foolhardy sysop has to *occasionally* admit is more than
just their own system. Hey, if you want to let it fall into a soapbox
rant of my very own, hey, fine by me. I have megs o' text to run. Old
articles for punkzines, personal letters, software proposals, source
files, hex dumps of memory, lots of great stuff.

Yes, this is a threat. You can counteract it by placing this threat
under the noses (pens, OK fingers) of prospective authors. Make threats
of your own!

OK, now that I've appeased my own guilt, here's the news.

Southwestern Bell in Missouri

by Bill White
Sysop (1:280/15)


Well, this is just to let our fellow SysOps around the country know
what Southwestern Bell telephone company is doing now in the state
of Missouri.

Southwestern Bell has filed petition with the Missouri Public
Service Commission to have all BBSs reclassified as business
customers, and to impose business rates on us.

Some of us will remember when Bell tried the same tactics in
Houston, Texas.  Before the case made it into the courts, Bell
relented and agreed to a three telephone line 'hobby' BBS
definition.  William Bailey, Southwestern Bells district manager
of rate administration for Missouri, was quoted in the _Kansas City
Star_ newspaper as saying that was "an enormous mistake", and added
that phone companies are unable to monitor whether or not a
bulletin board is collecting money from users.  How about that!
*grin*  Southwestern Bell telephone doesn't even know how to
telecommunicate!

Since the Bell Co's have been given permission to enter the
information services business, we can expect all the Bell companies
to begin trying to squeeze the free competition out of their way.
(That is most of us, BTW.)  Don't feel too safe where ever you run
your BBS.  There have been reports coming in that Oregon and
Indiana have both been similarly 'steam-rolled' in the last couple
of months.

In Missouri, the BBS fight has been picked up by the Greater Kansas
City Sysops Association (GKCSA), thanks in large part to Bill Hirt
(1:280/304).  Bill has information FREQable on the Texas case, and
on the Missouri case to date.  If you would like this sizable
amount of data, FREQ MISSOURI and/or TEXAS magicnames.

The GKCSA very recently became a Non-Profit corporation in the
State of Missouri. If you are fortunate enough to be able to help
out your Missouri cousins with a tax deductible donation towards
our legal expenses, please send to:

Thanks, and we'll keep you posted on the Southwestern Bells
proposal here in Missouri.

What is a point?



                   What the heck's the Point?

     I know many of you are staying up late at night, dying to know
what the heck's a FidoNet Point?  Well I have heard you're silent
screams of agony and ignorance, and I'm here to enlighten you.  (A
little too pretentious, huh? Okay, I'll tone it down, sorry.)

     FidoNet is an international network of volunteer computer BBS
SysOps linked to each other in order to exchange messages and
files.  But, you say, I don't have a BBS, and I'm not a SysOp, but
I would sure like to get in on all this fun.  THAT, my friend, is
what the heck a FidoNet point is.  A PoOp, or Point Operator, has
a system configured with all the software necessary to call a
FidoNet Node, upload messages, and download replies, any time he
so desires.  He can also upload and download files with his
software, and even has an official FidoNet address for sending/
receving NetMail.  He doesn't need to go through a lengthy logon
procedure or even remember his password each time he calls the
system designated as his feed, or BossNode.  His computer
remembers how to do all that for him, and can do it automagically
while the poor, abused PoOp catches up on his sleep.  When he
gets up in the morning, he can read all the mail brought in by
his system during the night, make the appropriate replies, and
prepare them to be sent out on the mail run for that night.  And,
maybe best of all, he can do all this without having to endure
the abuse heaped on the much maligned SysOps who are the real
backbone of the system.

     So, you say, How can I get in on this magic? (What, you didn't
say that? Well, you should have.)  There are some very simple steps
involved.  First, you have to find a cooperative SysOp to act as
your feed.  The system where you obtained this file would be a
good place to start your search.  Said SysOp should either have the
software necessary to setup a point, or know where it can be
obtained.  Most SysOps that already have point systems they are
working with will have software that they can recommend.  Download
the software from the BBS, set up and configure the software with
your name and FidoNet address assigned to you by your BossNode, and
prepare to be astounded.  You should also find out what Echo areas
are available from the BBS, and choose the ones that interest you.
One word of warning -- please find out a little bit about Echo
'good manners' before you start entering messages in these areas.
Briefly, try to keep your messages short and on the subject of
interest.  And if you're feeling really generous, you might even
volunteer to help your local SysOp pick up some of the tab for his
FidoNews 8-48                  Page 4                       2 Dec 1991


long distance bill.  (Just to give you some idea of the
dedication of SysOps, most of these guys have phone bills every
month that are more than their car payments!!!)

     One more comment and I'm done.  It certainly pays to stay on
the good side of your BossNode, as he controls your access to the
net.  As you may have noticed, I haven't said anything bad about
SysOps in this text, and I don't intend to.  You see, I learned my
lesson when I got my first point system.  Everything ran
beautifully, until I asked a simple question.  I happened to
mention to my BossNode SysOp that if I was a PoOp, and he was my
feed, didn't that make him a PoOpy chute?  I suddenly noticed a
drastic drop in the amount of mail coming into my point. <grin>
My mail traffic did resume as soon as I performed the suitable
groveling. :-)

------------------------------------------------------------------

This message is dedicated in memory of David Miller of Longview,
TX, a great man, and an example of all the best things in FidoNet.
As SysOp of Barnco BBS, David was my first BossNode, and taught me
most of what I know about FidoNet.  Tragically, he was stricken
with cancer shortly after we met, and passed away soon after.

                       He is sorely missed.

[This was written a few years back. I'm running it without contacting
the author. Note that with the advent of TICK/FLEA, a lot of technical
hurdles are gone...

With the PGP package, as it exists without change in MSDOS excutable
form, exceedingly high security could be had for "free". Each net would
simply generate their nodelist fragment as a DIFF, PGP it, and FLEA/TICK
it. Whenever a file appears in the ZnnnLST directory, you simply handle
it as a NODEDIFF. That's all. (You could even manually rename each
incoming file NODEDIFF.1, NODEDIFF.2, etc so existing software would
accept it!

    Decentralizing the FidoNet <tm> Nodelist - Decentralizing FidoNet
Power

Think of FidoNet as a confederation of local nets.  Forget regions.
Forget zones except as a way of saving telco charges by concentrating
messages and as a way to segment the total nodelist.  FidoNet returns to
being a collection of local nets, as it was before the region and zone
hierarchies were added just a few years ago.

In each zone there is an echo, call it ZnnnLIST, to which every NC in
that zone subscribes.  In the North American zone, it is Z001LIST.  For
the moment, do not worry about the security or reliability of this echo,
but things like sequence numbers, checksums, and RSA public key
signatures can be used to address such problems (you are aware that RSA
can be used to send a validatable signature, yes?).

When an NC's net (or hub) segment undergoes significant change
(significant is that which would be likely to affect callers from
outside one's own net), then the NC posts a processed version of that
segment to the ZnnnLIST echo.  The processing could be to create a
difference file, compress the file, maybe RSA signature encode it, or
whatever else is deemed necessary.  A simplistic scheme to start is a
collection of lines of the form

    add z:n/n <new node line>
    del z:n/n
    chg z:n/n <altered nodel line>

similar to the prerevolutionary nodediff file.

By placing the processed segment in the ZnnnLIST echo, each net's
nodelist segment(s) will be automatically distributed to all other nets
within that zone.  This is the essence of the scheme.

Each NC automatically accumulates the changes to the zone nodelist as
they pass by in the ZnnnLIST echo for their zone.  Once a week (or two),
they create a difference file against last week's accumulated zone
nodelist, and distribute this new difference file within their local
net.  The nodes within the net are thus insulated from all change, and
do not have to change their prerevolutionary batch files or programs.

The zonegates exchange periodic diffference files for their zones, and
make the lists (or difference files) of the other zones available within
their own, likely via the local ZnnnLIST echo.  Since the advent of
zonegates, one need not know much about a node in another zone, only the
sysop's name and the node number. So we could choose to reduce the size
of lists we keep of other zones, if the thought is not too scary.

Note that a first prototype of this methodology could be constructed
from existing software plus a few days of coding.
