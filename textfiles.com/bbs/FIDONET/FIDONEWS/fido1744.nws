     This week we have a "mail storm" of echo mail in the echoes most
     heavily traveled by Elflords and their subjects. It seems that the
     election time table is a bone of contention by some of the brightest
     minds in Fidoland. I don't find the various excuses for delaying the
     election until after the holidays credible. Why? Simply because there
     will ALWAYS, (any time of the year), be obstacles of holidays,
     vacations, unrest in some regions, and pouting, kicking, pointing, mud
     pie deliveries... etc.; so let us get on with it NOW.

     Since the Z1C serves at the behest of the RCC, the same should huddle
     in conference among themselves and come to the conclusions necessary
     for the accomplishment of an election for the Z1C position.  Either
     announce a Sysop type election, or a RCC type election.

     In either case an "Election Chairman" should be appointed by the RCC.
     She/he should announce the rules of the election. The rules should be
     simple, straight forward, and succinct. Considering this age of
     instant electronic communication, the time frame can be cut
     dramatically from the time frames used in the past. Months to do what
     should be accomplished in weeks, should be one of the MAIN guide
     lines. By today's technology. This could be accomplished by
     Thanksgiving Day in America. I can hear the roar of disapproval now...
     Can't please all.

     JMHO.

     little "tickler punny" in as a light moment for the Snooze readers,
     not as FACT. Since you took it seriously and challenged it, I took you
     advice and looked more carefully at your referenced URL. I did find
     references to refute, Correction below:
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     How Green Was My Ballyhoo Claim: Coca-Cola was originally green.

     Status:   False.

     Origins:   Though this tidbit of knowledge has been widely distributed
     as part of an Internet "Did You Know?" list, at no time in Coca-Cola's
     history has that beverage been green. The original formula called for
     caramel to give Coca-Cola its rich brown color, and although the
     recipe has undergone some changes through the years, none of them
     affected the ultimate color of the product.

     (Brown also hides impurities in any given batch, something the
     backroom chemist who invented Coca-Cola in 1886 kept well in mind as
     he proceeded with his formulation. These days syrup producers and
     bottlers have no impurities to hide, but back in the "three copper
     kettles in somebody's basement" days, covering up what might have
     inadvertently dropped into the mix was a concern, and brown hid
     indiscretions remarkably well.)

     Coke has at times been bottled in green glass bottles, which perhaps
     explains the popularity of this particular rumor.

     Hiya Warren.

     Hang on cuz I am gonna say one thing GOOD about our esteemed BK :) A
     very long time ago, I was having some severe problems in an echo I
     moderate and had to cut the feed of a user with a really dirty mouth.
     I crashed netmail out the wazoo and got nary a response from the
     sysop. (I think BK was the REC of R10 at that time and not yet the
     RC.) Well, there I was, not wanting to take it a step further and I
     asked BK for advice on the issue, giving him the details. Kohl gave me
     a lecture on being patient to wait on a response even though the war
     was really ripping my echo into shreds. Sure enough, I did get a
     response about the next day from the sysop who deeply apologized for
     not having answered sooner and he told me he had cut the user's
     access. The sysop had been out of town on business.

     Now, to be honest, one assumes that the RC's are paying attention to
     their netmail more closely the average Joe Sysop does and if I see a
     post from an RC who has not yet answered *important* netmail I sent
     them, I start to really wonder.

     Fido-folks, let's all take a moment to ask our God's blessings for
     Ruthie and all others in our Fido family who are suffering great pain
     and need releif and healing.
                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~end~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Sit down for a spell, Ol' WDB; I've got a little tale to tell you...

      It's a sordid, seedy tale, the same kind that sells so well in those
     supermarket tabloids, and it involves nodelists, lies and echomail.

      It seems there's been news getting out about some very disturbing
     elfish behavior of the chief nodelist clerk of that region that claims
     to be the great bastion of Fido freedom. Apparently if a sysop in
     Region 12 doesn't agree with the way things are being done there, he's
     looked down upon. If a R12 sysop chooses not to vote in their annual
     elections, he's apparently casted as an "outsider", and his
     nodelisting may even get pulled for "inactivity in the R12 echos", or
     some other foolishness in such vague terms as "lack of participation".
     It seems the elfishness even extends to the holy and anointed mail
     mover and "defender of the dogma" of Region 12, to whom someone
     apparently forgot to mention that the moving of echomail should not
     FIDONEWS 17-44               Page 6                   30 Oct 2000


     involve politics. Heaven forbid that an R12 node might try to crash
     route a netmail; the Fido "free region" is internet aware, don't you
     know; and has perfect routed netmail lines that never lose mail. Why
     bother with a silly little thing like POTS connectivity? Who still
     uses modems these days anyhow?

      But I digress... Getting back to the elfin antics of the top banana
     in the R12 bunch; it seems recently this "nodelist clerk" took a
     dislike to the sudden appearance of a certain node number of which he
     did not approve, in the path lines of a certain member of his region's
     echomail. Now this little detail perturbed this nodelist clerk so much
     that he just felt he had to fire off an immediate netmail to the
     offending node in order to voice his displeasure.

      Now is it just me, or does anyone else out there wonder just what
     business it is for a "nodelist clerk" where one of his regions sysops
     pulls his echomail from? The last time I checked, getting an echomail
     feed from a different source than the "approved" one was not a Fido
     crime, and not even against any policy that a region might choose not
     to recognize. It's funny, but when I started receiving echomail from a
     source in Region 18, it didn't seem such a big urgent deal to my
     "appointed" RC-17 that he felt he had to send me a netmail to try and
     get me "back in line". In fact, now I'm feeding my local net from that
     same source, and never heard a peep against it out of my own region.

      Yes, Ol' WDB, you guessed right; the node number which the R12
     ElfLo-* err, "nodelist clerk" objected to so much to was none other
     than 1:134/11; my own happy Fido home on the range. It's unlikely the
     RC-12 will believe it, but this particular sysop I did not solicit, as
     I do not believe in that sort of thing. He came to me of his own
     volition, since he was one of our hubs in another FTN of which I am an
     administrator, and he had returned from the black hole that others
     thought had swallowed him up for good, and wanted a feed in that
     network. As he was very dissatisfied with the holy anointed R12 mail
     mover, he also asked me to feed him Fidonet echomail. Being a good,
     hospitable Albertan and former Nova Scotian, I was not about to turn
     away a friend in need.

      Now true, I may have locked horns a time or two in the FN_SYSOP echo
     with the RC-12, but really, when it comes down to it, I am a Z1B mail
     hub, and anyone in this fine network who requests an echomail feed
     from me will be readily accomodated, so long as I have the resources
     to do so. I will *not* pick and choose who I feed echomail to based on
     Fidonet politics, and I should be able to expect that the elfishness
     of others should not be used as a vice to "squeeze" any of my
     downlinks about their echomail choices.

      It seems to me it doesn't make a difference if a *C is elected or
     appointed in this network. An elected *C who claims to be just a
     "nodelist clerk" clearly *can* act just like the ElfLords of yore. Not
     to worry, though; by the time this letter goes into the 'snooze, at
     least two oppressed nodes in Region 12 will have availed themselves of
     the geographic exemption clause in the Fidonet P-1.04 policy document
     and found asylum elsewhere. And to think; R12 thought *they* owned the
     concept of political asylum in Fidonet!

                      FTSC- What does it do?
                         By David Hallford


        First of all I would like to thank those who wrote me about my
     previous article. All responses were positive, which (trust me) is not
     the normal response I get when I write an article for the Fidonews.

        One thing most of the messages had in common were a
     misunderstanding of what the Fidonet Technical Standards Committee
     really does.

     Excerpts from FTA-1000 revision 2 dated 29 December 1997 and titled
     "FTSC Charter"

     ================== 1. Mission ----------

       The Fidonet Technical Standards Committee (FTSC) is responsible for
       providing a thorough technical definition of FidoNet and its
       protocols sufficient to maintain it as a compatible electronic mail
       system, specifically by:

     1. Documenting current practice in technical standards.
     2. Encouraging new technologies in Fidonet software development.
     3. Reassessing and revising FTS documents regularly.
     4. Being publicly accessible to Fidonet sysops.
     5. Distributing Technical Standards and Proposals.
     6. Providing FTS document interpretations on software compatibility.

     The FTSC shall maintain a publication which documents only the
     minimum acceptable protocol for a Fidonet node to receive mail as
     referred to in the current FidoNet Policy Document (Policy 4.07 at
     this writing) The FTSC shall not take upon itself any right to
     increase or decrease this requirement without express direction to do
     so from the International Coordinator (IC).
     ===================

     As you can see, the FTSC does not establish the technical standards
     of Fidonet,they document them. This does not mean that individual
     members of the FTSC, writing as individuals, do not write software
     which ends up in a standard. It means that the FTSC doesn't establish
     what the standard is - that is done by its acceptance by Fidonet *C's
     and SysOps. The FTSC merely takes the already established standard and
     documents it's use.

     So (IMHO) don't allow yourself to be limited by a current standard. If
     you have a better way of doing something - DO IT! - if it is accepted
     by the SysOps of Fidonet then it will be documented as a standard.

     Hello to all of Fidonet,

     Things happen in life that make you believe that there is a power
     above what we know and experience in this world. Sometimes it's a
     little thing, sometime it's big. The big stuff is easy to see and
     realize, the little things take more looking, but are just as
     wonderful.

     Generally in this section of Fidonews, I give a Web Page location and
     then a review of the page in as much of an analytical manner as my
     abilities can.

     Ok, here's the page address:

     http://www.n5049.z2.fidonet.org/

     And the title:

     TartarNet (2:5049@fidonet) official site


     Now, pardon me while I "bubble"(praise & ramble) a while. :-)

     To say this is a great site is by far an understatement in my humble
     opinion.  I love the background! What is that picture of? Is it clouds
     or...? Anyway, I like it!

     The site is Russian... Tatarstan Republic (Russia) to be exact. Now,
     don't let this stop you from visiting the site. The address that I
     gave came up in english. If I understand what I think I understand,
     the page detects the language you are using (from Windows) and
     displays the page accordingly.

     I really wish I had learned a second language when I was in school
     those many years ago. At my age now, I don't think that learning a
     second language would be possible. If you are a young person in
     school, learn that second, third, or as many, languages as you can.
     You might not think it worthwhile now and it might be a pain, but you
     will thank yourself later in life. Don't argue with me, just DO IT!
     ;-)

     Ok, back to the site.

     Look this site over good. Follow _ALL_ the links. Many are in Russian,
     but many are in english. Even the ones in Russian tell a story if you
     look and take a few minutes to study them.  Find the photos of the
     people in this TartarNet and see what they look like, who they are and
     FIDONEWS 17-44               Page 13                  30 Oct 2000


     realize that we aren't so different after all! If you follow the links
     deep enough, you'll learn about the Tatarstan Republic, Fidonet in
     Russia, Fidonet in this area of Russia and more.

     Now, what was it I was saying in the first paragraph of this review??
     Ah yes...

     "Things happen in life that make you believe that there is a power
     above what we know and experience in this world. Sometimes it's a
     little thing, sometime it's big. The big stuff is easy to see and
     realize, the little things take more looking, but are just as
     wonderful."

     Now, I've probably got you wondering and confused. Here we go:

     In the Fidonews Echo, there has been much talk about different
     formats, languages and ways to offer the Fidonews and Fidonet. Here's
     a place that is doing just that. Praise be to the people behind this
     site. They have went the "extra mile" and learned the "second
     language" and used it to show Fidonet to their country as well as
     allow another country to understand their country. A small thing? Yes,
     but just as wonderful. If you look hard, you will also realize that
     this "TartarNet" offers their Echos to any that is wanting them.
     Another small thing, but still wonderful.

     I'm going to shut up now. In closing, I'll say this:

     Get off you behind, fire up your web browser, connect to your ISP and
     visit this site. Don't argue, just _DO IT_! ;-))

     Hi all,

     Discussions are still going on about how to facilitate the upcoming
     Z1C elections and when to have them...

     Options and variations thereof being discussed are:

     voting method
       sysop wide voting
       sysop to NC to RC style.

     start soonest
       EC (most likely Carol since she moves to Japan in May)
       no interim Z1C

     start after holidays
       interim ZC - full responsibilities
       interim ZC - just diff processing


     Z1_POLITICAL should be heating up soon.

     a @ preceding an individual's name implies a virtual email
     address. The email is translated as follows
     firstlast@osirusoft.com will automatically route to the
     appropriate individual's email.  Anyone in this list will
     also receive routed notice of this feature.  In my case, it
     would still be joejared@osirusoft.com, but you get the idea.

     Also, as information is provided to me, I will be adding a
     latency field to each node, which is defined as the maximum
     time between when the message is received, and when it is
     sent on to other nodes, or available to be sent onward,
     defined in minutes. A latency of ! implies that there is an
     immediate response, and an attempt to deliver immediately
     after processing, or a "MinuteMail System", as it were.
