     =================================================================
                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================


     A few items of interest...

                        ==============================

     There are times when it is actually amusing to watch what happens
     in FidoNet, especially when certain individuals make attempts to
     prove a point, and don't realize what is in store for them.

     Doc Logger appears, again, having made an erroneous assumption in
     his previous column...it makes no difference and actually points out
     precisely the point I was indeed trying to make...and to answer his
     unspoken question, it takes me about seven hours to read the book.
     Doc did good...he just hasn't realized why yet.

                        ==============================

     And the "scorched earth" policy seems to be moving to a quick and
     earnest conclusion...

     John Souvestre has apparently decided to go for an "endgame" in
     making a direct challenge to the Z1EC, Bob Kohl, by making several
     accusations, including the claim that the Editor of the FidoNews
     has refused to post election results as submitted.

     Likewise, John has decided to join in the furor over my "true
     identity", and make claims that I have committed "voter fraud".

     As well, allegations of 'bribery' and 'payoffs' have been made.

     A pity that Mr. Souvestre is about to become the very foolish
     looking person that he has long been accused of being...and by his
     very own hand.

     I would, again, point out to John that the FidoNews publishes what
     is submitted to it...and the only "editing" done is to meet the
     margin requirements (which occasionally slip by...sorry, Michele!).

     As to the rest...

     Keep watching, everyone...this should prove to be highly
     entertaining.

                        ==============================

     This line with the mention of "Ward Dossche" is included to meet the
     alleged 'all-consuming devotion of the FidoNews Editorial' with Ward.
     As it is, Ward has not submitted his "Doomsday Countdown" for the
     last few weeks and, at his specific request, I am not publishing any
     copy of it without his permission.

                        ==============================
     FIDONEWS 15-19               Page 2                   11 May 1998


     However, to that end, it appears from tossing the nodediff here each
     week that it may indeed be time to look at the long-quelled and oft
     suppressed (or so several have said) requests from various sysops to
     establish a new Zone in FidoNet...Zone 7.

     The advantages are obvious...it significantly lessens the chances
     of tie votes in the ZCC; it balances the Zones and gives more direct
     representation to the sysops involved; and it reduces the chances of
     Regional Coordinators being drowned out when they wish to address
     issues of their areas.

     The downside of it is, of course, that the current "majority" in the
     confines of Zone 2 would likely be reduced to a comparable level
     with all other Zones, but what's more important...maintaining a
     majority, or enhancing and enabling representation closer to the real
     population?

     As well, with the advent of BinkD and ARGUS, it may be that the
     future center of new developments in FidoNet is shifting yet once
     again...

     An issue to consider for the ZCC, no doubt...along with another.

                        ==============================

     Yet another FTSC member has resigned from the group, citing some
     personal reasons.

     I believe this means we have lost a total of three FTSC members, but
     I can't be certain since I've seemingly been denied access to the
     FTSC echoes overall, even though I was elected to that body.

     As a member of FTSC, I've not been able to gain access to the FTSC
     Working Group echoes since these were established, and only five
     messages have passed through the main FTSC echo since these echoes
     were established.

     I'm certain that this is *merely* an oversight, but my queries as
     to where to get a feed from have been met with stony silence and
     a 'humorous' comment that I have been added to the SEEN-BY of every
     member's posts.

     Since I've received no real responses to my queries, I suppose that
     posting this here instead may garner a few more serious responses,
     no?

     Or, at the least, present a case for the ZCC to decide on the merits
     and usefulness of the newest incarnation of the FTSC.

     Communication doesn't work if it is only one way...

                        ==============================

     Next week, I will attempt to carry out something that hasn't been
     seen in the FidoNews in quite some time...a personal interview with
     another member of FidoNet in a face-to-face meeting.

     Let's see if we can meet before I say who and where...

                        ==============================

     And that's it...a few items of interest to consider, one and all.

     Remembering Frank Ellermann of 2:240/5815
     by Wulf Krueger, 2:2437/209

     FIDONEWS 15-19               Page 6                   11 May 1998


     Only a few of you out there will have noticed what has happened
     in Nodelist 114. One of us has finally dropped from the Nodelist
     after having been down for around 5 months. Why do I mention this
     fact? Many nodes are leaving today daily.

     Frank Ellermann, formerly known as 2:240/5815, was a very special
     person. He had excellent skills in FidoNet techniques; IMHO he
     was one of the most brilliant among us. He has been actively
     developing FSCs (now known as FSPs) and he wrote small piece of
     FTN software himself. But there was much more to him..

     Frank was not only an excellent technician but he was an out-
     standing personality. He was a very kind and gentle person. We
     all know our common ways in FidoNet today - bashing and throwing
     dirt at each other. I have never seen him writing such mails.
     Frank always tried to see the "bright side of life" and the
     bright side of every single person - even if it was someone he
     did not like. Even when he was attacked himself he never chose
     to flame back, he took it with much humour. For this behaviour
     he was widely respected by those who knew him. Even those who
     critisized him respected him as a person.

     Frank wrote long mails (he was famous for that, too,
     Frank "Ellenlang" ;) ) about FTN, about democratic principles in
     FidoNet and (sometimes) about life in general.
     He was one of the authors of the local policy of R2:24, the so-
     called RegPol24 which IMHO helped us very much to establish
     democratic principles in R2:24. He has given much advice to
     the current ZC2, Ward Dossche, myself and many others - to anyone
     who asked him.

     Frank always seemed to be full of joy though he was not the kind
     of person to show his personal feelings to anyone. I knew him
     for several years and learned to interpret his words quite well,
     we became very good friends in fact. Indeed, I consider him
     having once saved my life.

     Frank joined FidoNet late in 1994 and became a node in 1995.
     Now Frank has completely disappeared and it really hurts me and
     makes me feel bad. When Frank had to go down in the middle of
     Decembre 1997 we both hoped that he would come up again. I spoke
     to him on the 15th of January this year and as always he sounded
     very good. :-)
     Since that day I have lost any contact. Frank has no telephone
     anymore and he doesn't answer my letters. When I tried to visit
     him he did not answer the door bell. I hope and I suppose he is
     physically well but having lost him as a fellow node and, which
     is much harder for me, as a good friend is very sad but it's his
     decision.

     Concerning his FSCs I ask Odinn Sorensen, chairman of the new
     FTSC, to take Frank's submission as *public domain*. This is
     what Frank wanted if his node was removed from the Nodelist to
     make sure that they could be improved by others who take up his
     good work and I want this to come true to honour him.

     I ask all you others out there, those of you how knew him, those
     of you who have read his name in FTSC_PUBLIC or elsewhere and all
     others, to remember him, to take up where he had to stop, to try
     to take him as an example of how to communicate with others.
     FidoNet could be much more human and much more fun then.

     At least I will always remember him and I wish him the best of
     luck.

     If you should, by any means, get to read this, Frank, I hope you
     will remember my words in one of our last netmails.
     I miss you.

     Dear Editorbeing,

     This missive is submitted by Doc Logger (163/110) who was
     busy trying to sort out whether Hans Mangold really exists,
     or whether he is just another one of Zorch's pseudos...or
     maybe it was the other way around.

     Roll da flic, Zorch....

     Dear Reverend Visage,

     This may turn out to be a shorter epic than usual because
     the squid are mating in the lagoon and I can tell you there
     there is no finer daiquiri than that which is made from
     squid eggs, fresh bananas, and some of the local potent
     alcoholic beverages. This is one of those seasonal rarities
     where I give in to indolence and forgo the usual educational
     discussions with the Giant Clams.

     This week, the ace Nodelist detectives went rangy when they
     discovered that even more souls had fled to the Sherwood
     Forest sanctuary of Net163. First moron up to the plate was
     good ole' Dallas Hinton who whined " I wish to protest most
     strongly you allowing yet another private node from out of
     the Net 163 geographic area. ... As required by policy, I am
     writing to you to discuss the problem before taking any
     other steps. I await your reply at your earliest
     convenience." Alas poor Dallas still doesn't get it. The
     node in question asked to join our net because he felt that
     he was being harassed by his NC and could get no joy from
     Hinton.

     Next up, striving to outdo even Hinton for idiocy was  Tom
     Hall (1:342/1) "I am therefore forced to conclude that the
     following represents a violation of Policy4, and if this
     violation is not reversed in a timely fashion, then I shall
     file a formal policy complaint with you over the action of
     your NC." Hint for Blondes there Tom: Stop abusing your
     nodes and maybe they'd actually want to stay in your net.

     And finally, batting clean-up and as usual, dumber than
     squid, we heard from Bob "Noted" Satti who said: "I don't
     recall granting you a geographical exemption for nodes from
     Edmonton and Rhode Island. NOW he is saying that he will
     stay in net 163 because you folks 'want him to'. THAT isn't
     a good enough reason. Please clean up your net segment. You
     don't have a single geographical exemption from me, and so
     there shouldn't be any out of area nodes in your segment.
     It's not as if you weren't given fair warning that I would
     be watching your segment." Poor Bob doesn't get it either.

     If he'd quit sitting on his thumbs and install a little
     accountability among his elflords, there really wouldn't be
     a need to have nodes joining Net163. Hint for Blonde Bobs:
     With respect to your demand to "clean up the net segment",
     piss off and go away. When you get a mandate to do anything
     other than clerk the nodelist, then perhaps we'll sit in
     rapt attention at your semiliterate grumblings.

     And finally, a rather long quote taken from an ancient
     Fidonews, written by Tom Jennings.

     "    FidoNews 6-33 Page 11  14 Aug 1989

          How Did This Happen?
         Tom Jennings 1:125/111

     Let's  keep  this simple:  at no time  have  the sysops of
     our FidoNet  network given /0's the privilege of determining
     how  our network  is  run. They  are not representatives of
     anyone  but themselves;  they  are  merely  administrative
     nodes to generate nodelist  fragments,  help new  sysops
     get  online  and  act  as repositories of the necessary
     network  files.   They are ordinary nodes with more work to
     do.

     A  dangerous thing has been attempted,  and  is  undermining
     the trust that we rely on.  "POLICY4" is simply not in
     effect, it was not voted upon by the members at large.  I,
     and many many others, are simply ignoring the supposed
     policy "change".  How  did  this happen?

     POLICY4  is terrible policy.  It takes the right to  choose
     your own net host way!  It entrenches /0's as positions of
     authority. This is  insane  and  does  not facilitate our
     communications.  A "smoothly running network"  is  not  our
     goal;    we are here to communicate, that is all.    We do
     that well now.  Even voting on POLICY4 is insane, it
     certainly  will  not benefit the 6000 or so sysops in the
     network!

     I've  had  FidoNet  users  tell  me    that  their  host
     doesn't automatically route them their host-routed mail.
     This  was  the most  basic  purpose of a net host to  begin
     with!    The  whole concept  of  host-routing  was to make
     FidoNet more effecient  by concentrating calls!

     Anyways,  If  a  few-dozen  or  -hundred  /0's  can vote,
     then  a few-thousand can represent themselves just as
     simply.  So what if it takes a long time, expediency is not
     a goal.  If we don't have the tool(s), write  them  or do it
     by hand.  Freeze a nodelist as the  "list of registered
     voters".    Have  everyone  send  in  a message.  Check them
     off the list.  Hold redundant votes, compare results.  Give
     it a month.    The net runs fine, there is no need to
     implement bad policy just to satisfy some bureaucratic
     urge!"

     This is no real Chautauqua in this week's column other than
     the one that juxtaposes Satti and Hinton's lunacies against
     the words of Tom Jennings. Being an incurable optimist, I
     believe that we'll eventually return to the point where
     Fidonet exists solely as a cooperative effort among sysops
     and not as the fiefdom of Satti and his fartcatchers in the
     RCC.

     I must go Visage, the tide is turning which means that I'll
     be battling the Fiddler crabs for the rum if I don't hurry.
     Sorry about your car. How was I supposed to know that the
     shocks would give out after I'd loaded it with a mere 20
     tonnes of concrete?
