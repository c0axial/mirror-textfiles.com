     John Herro
     1:3610/38

              Why the Restrictions on Public Domain Software?

     Some of the  VERY  BEST  software around is  public  domain,  and
     that's especially true of communications programs.   But unfortu-
     nately,  some of this excellent software isn't available from the
     shareware/PD houses,  because the authors  forbid  anyone to earn
     money by distributing their software.  As a result,  the software
     has to be downloaded or file requested.   Now don't get me wrong.
     The authors have every right to place whatever  restrictions they
     want on their programs,  because  they own the software.   What I
     don't understand is their  MOTIVE for not allowing others to sell
     the SERVICE of copying these programs.

     For example, there's an EXCELLENT program that serves as a commu-
     nications terminal as well as a front end mailer.   As a terminal
     program, it has X-, Y-, and Z-modem built in,  along with Sealink
     and  Telink.   (More than one  commercial  program lacks Zmodem!)
     Although the PD program doesn't have a  dialing  menu  quite like
     some  shareware  and  commercial products, it uses the whole Fido
     NodeList for a dialing directory!   Just type a  net/node  number
     and the rest is  automatic!   I don't know of any other  terminal
     program that does that.   And as a front end mailer,  the PD pro-
     gram saves many a sysop from spending $100 on a commercial  mail-
     er.  And this excellent program isn't even shareware; it's FREE!

     Then there's a  superb  bulletin-board  program,  one of the most
     commonly used in FidoNet.   It's very user friendly,  and it pro-
     vides Continuous Mail capability even WITHOUT a front-end mailer!
     Phone it with a mailer program,  and it recognizes the mailer and
     lets you request files  and  send and receive  messages  with  or
     without  files  attached.  Phone the same program with a terminal
     program, and you're welcomed to the BBS without delay! Now THAT'S
     software!  The price of this state-of-the-art BBS system?  That's
     right, FREE!

     But for some reason, you can't get these programs from the share-
     ware/PD houses; you have to find them yourself.  On many bulletin
     boards, you have to wait to be validated before you can even look
     to see if the board has the files you want.   The files for these
     programs take quite  a  while  to  download,  unless you're lucky
     enough to own a high speed modem.  You better have something GOOD
     to upload,  or the large  downloads  won't endear you to the host
     sysops.  Also,  the bulletin board program is spread over a large
     number of files, and you may have difficulty determining when you
     have all the files you need.   Now please don't misunderstand me.
     The trouble of  finding  and  downloading  these files is a  VERY
     SMALL PRICE to pay for such excellent programs,  and we should be
     truly  grateful  to the authors for providing them.   But I would
     gladly pay some  shareware/PD house a few bucks per disk to go to
     FIDONEWS 7-25                Page 2                   18 Jun 1990


     this trouble for me.

     Believe it or not,  I'm lucky enough to live near a  shareware/PD
     RETAIL STORE!  Yes,  on my way home from work I can walk into the
     store and get a copy of any program in their catalog,  instantly,
     for $3 a disk!  The catalog has a whole paragraph describing each
     program, providing much more detail than the single line descrip-
     tions found on most bulletin boards.   It also  explains  clearly
     about  paying  for shareware.   I turn to the  Telecommunications
     section of the catalog  and find several  terminal  programs  and
     several bulletin boards, but none as good as the PD programs men-
     tioned above.

     THANK YOU,  programmers,  for providing such  wonderful software!
     But why do some of you dislike these  shareware/PD  houses?   You
     have  every right to say that you don't want anyone earning money
     by handling YOUR programs,  but why not give your users a choice:
     to download your programs or to pay someone else to download them
     instead?

                   SIGN FRIENDS-ECHO & FILE INFORMATION

     The response to SIGN FRIENDS has been overwhelming and a few
     developments have occured since the article was released in
     FIDONEWS.

     We had planned to form our own echo for SIGN FRIENDS but we had
     an invitation from the SILENTTALK Echo and we are taking them up
     on the offer. SIGN FRIENDS will be supported on the SILENTTALK
     echo which is available on the backbone. Check with your NEC for
     a tie in.

     I also had a few requests about the file sizes. Well I decided
     not only to list the sizes but to give you the complete file
     info so you know you have the real thing. Please note that
     SIGN37-3.XXX has been updated. If you have a version dated prior
     to 5-27-90 all you need to do is FILE REQUEST MENUII3.BAS and
     you'll have the latest version.

                        Tiffany & Debbie Gibson Echo
                              by Daniel Tobias
                                  1:380/7

     Despite popular demand, I have inaugurated an echo devoted to the
     young singers, Debbie Gibson and Tiffany.  This echo, TIFF&DEB,
     is being distributed as a non-backbone echo to participating
     sysops for the purpose of discussing Tiff and Deb in an
     atmosphere free of the obnoxious flaming that ensues when their
     names come up in the general MUSIC echo.

     Any sysop interested in carrying TIFF&DEB should send me netmail.

     You can take a peek at it in message area 14 of my system,
     reachable 24 hours at (318) 424-9260, up to 2400 bps.

     More Tiffany scoops can be had by file-requesting or downloading
     TIFFANY.ZIP, which includes a full chronology of her life and
     career among other things.

     [Yep, that's Tiffany on the cover of the Spy Magazine "Separated
     At Birth II" book, twinned with Julian Lennon, of all people.
     And it's her voice you hear in the "Jetsons" movie coming
     attraction now seen in theaters; she does three songs there as
     well as the voice of Judy Jetson.  Regrettably, her good friend
     Debbie Gibson has to wait a bit longer for her own silver screen
     debut; her "Skirts" movie was scrubbed due to studio politics.
     What are they up to next?  Read the TIFF&DEB echo to find out!]

     DISCLAIMER:  This echo is not endorsed by Deborah Gibson, Tiffany
     or their respective management.  Let's hope they don't sue...

     1:107/501

     The UNITEX Communications BBS published a feature story in
     FIDONEWS and ALTERNEWS in the summer of 1988, in which we
     described the concept of operating a specialized
     information and news system using data and information from
     'internal' United Nations databases and selected news
     services.  A lot of new developments have occurred since
     then.  The results and findings of this pilot project will
     be discuused at a seminar in the upcoming CONCLAVE '90.
     Below is an abstract highlighting some of the key areas of
     discussion:

                      ABSTRACT

     UNITEX: Specialized Information and Technology Transfer

     Participants:

     James Waldron, Ph.D Senior Director and Research Associate
     Dorothy Nicklus, International NGO Representative to the UN

     Dr. James Waldron has formal training and degrees in
     chemical engineering, chemical physics, computer science
     and the philosophy of science and has taught at Rutgers
     Medical School, New Jersey Institute of Technology and New
     York University as Associate Professor.  Seven years
     industrial experience at a major petroleum corporation as a
     senior systems scientist and research specialist.
     Publisher of specialized software for the typography and
     printing industry (GAMS and CHROMOS). Recipient of several
     NSF and NIH grants and awards.

     Ms. Dorothy Nicklus, UN NGO, has been an International
     Non-Governmental Organization Representative for more than
     nine years. An extensive background at the United Nations
     starting from the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space Conference
     (1981-1982), including the recipient of an INTELSAT-PROJECT
     SHARE grant and other awards. Background includes formal
     training in graphic arts and design, advertising, video
     production and typography. Owner of the REGENT GROUP
     Corporation, specializing in publishing and financial
     printing.

     Subject:

     UNITEX (United Nations Information Transfer Exchange) has
     been pioneering the use and application of wide area
     network technology in the areas of specialized information
     transfer, using micro computers, since 1984.  Starting as a
     pilot project, with the cooperation of UN Department of
     Public Information (UN DPI), UNITEX went on-line in New
     York City with Fido 11w.  Custom software was designed to
     aid and implement the acquisition of data and information
     from several UN international databases maintained on
     FIDONEWS 7-25                Page 7                   18 Jun 1990


     mainframes in New York, Geneva and Africa. UNITEX added
     other news agencies and related information sources to
     augment what was to become the International UNITEX ECHO
     Conference which became a FidoNet backbone conference in
     September 1987, with worldwide distribution.  Unitex was
     the first organization that distributed, worldwide,
     special  sessions of the United Nations General Assembly,
     along with, regular scheduled meetings anof the UN General
     Assembly, UN press Releases, UN Radio News, news and
     special bulletins from UNICEF

     What started out as a simple stand-alone BBS with no
     network capability became a networked host and gateway for
     a conference that was ported to over two dozen major
     networks in several countries and was available on more
     than ten thousand machines worldwide.  UNITEX was
     highlighted in August 1989 on CNN News - Science and
     Technology Section and has been a source of information for
     international correspondents and journalists as well as a
     host system (WorldTalk Network) to receive articles from
     journalists around the globe.

     UNITEX has been an advocate of publishing and transferring
     unabridged and uncensored news, data and information for
     social benefit. UNITEX spearheaded a major effort to
     open-up an international body of information maintained by
     the United Nations, which previously had very limited
     distribution.  This was done in the general public interest
     and to encourage debate, to exchange ideas and to transfer
     technology between the industrialized nations and the
     developing nations.  The platform for this exchange grew to
     include other related newsworthy and related international
     events, such as the United Nations Environmental Programme;
     health and medical news, concerning crisis intervention,
     treatment of rare diseases, epidemics, worldwide treatment
     and disease prevention programs; United Nations Disaster
     Relief, concerning aid to hurricane victims, natural
     occuring disasters, chemical and radiation accidents;
     Department of Defense news briefings, DOD press releases
     and other related news which can concern a society
     at-large.

     UNITEX is presently running on a PS/2 Model 60, 3 MB ram,
     160 MB storage, Telebit PEP 9600 Baud.

     SEAdog 4.51b/GROUPmail 2.18/OPUS 1.12/KITTEN describe the
     software interfaces.

     The 'gating' of UNITEX has demonstrated some remarkable
     technical feats that would be unheard of only a few years
     ago but has also returned some invaluable data that we will
     discuss in more detail at the UNITEX Seminar.

     Hackers --

     In my early days of programming, circa 1977, we did not have
     the tools for program development that we have today.  I wasn't
     using a full screen source editor until around 1981.  When we
     tested our software, it was in the test bed, since we didn't
     develop software on the 'target' machine.  Those were the days
     of 'punch cards' and 'listings'.

     When you tested, and found problems, you didn't stop and
     edit/recompile/relink/load because that cycle could take up to a
     full day.  What you did was PATCH the problem using the binary
     representation of the instructions you needed.  Then you could
     continue testing.  By the end of your test session, you might
     have several patches, which you would then use to rewrite the
     source in preparation for your next testing session.

     Your ability to quickly patch the machine code, and get the
     program working was favorably noted by your supervisors and
     peers.  The art and science of testing under these conditions
     was valuable knowledge and contributed to your reputation as a
     software developer.

     As I look at Webster's Ninth, (C) 1989, I see several
     definitions for the words 'hack' and 'hacker'.  First HACK.
     Most common ( and in use since before the 12th century ) is "to
     cut with repeated irregular or unskillful blows".  In reference
     to program testers, this is a wonderful metaphor, like calling
     the 300 pound man 'Tiny'.  Compared to the source code, a patch
     is a rather unskillful blow to a program.

     Other definitions for the verb form include words like
     "reshape", "rough cuts" and "cutting blows".  These typify the
     standard procedure of program patching where a problem was
     fixed in the most simple way, or entire sections of code are
     branched around in order to get as much code tested in the time
     frame allowed.

     A second definition : hack is short for hackney, a horse
     suitable for riding or driving.  This usage, ( from around 1745
     ) implies a work for hire attitude, with loose
     professionalism.  Taxicab drivers are known as hacks because
     taxis were once horse drawn ( haven't you seen the Sherlock
     Holmes shows ? ).  This analogy clearly fits the good
     programmer, who works like a horse and never wears a tie !

     FIDONEWS 7-25                Page 10                  18 Jun 1990


     Hackwork, ( 1851 ), is "literary, artistic or professional work
     done on order according to formula and in conformity with
     commercial standards.  Clearly applicable in the 1970s to
     programming, created according to specifications. There seems
     to be a fit with the appearance of contract programmers, not
     unusual with respect to the artistic nature of programming.

     This brings us now to the word HACKER.  There are two
     definitions.  The first ( from 1620 ) one that hacks, a person
     who is inexperienced or unskilled at a particular activity. The
     second, ( from 1976 ) AN EXPERT AT PROGRAMMING AND SOLVING
     PROBLEMS WITH A COMPUTER.

     It's obvious that HACKER is an endearing term, full of metaphor
     as the hard working, easy going individualist.  At least until
     the early 1980s when two things happened :  1) computers became
     affordable to a wide group of people, and 2) computers became
     widely usable by all types of commercial and governmental
     endeavors.


     Voyeurs, Burglars and Vandals --

     Voyeurism - visual stimulation;  burglary - theft;  vandal -
     to deface.

     Today's definition for HACKER probably stems from the person who
     used his microcomputer to communicate with someone else's
     computer, gained entry to that computer's application or
     operating system command interpreter, and 1) was proud of the
     successful attempt to see what was not supposed to be seen, 2)
     by seeing, stole information and procedures, and 3) may even
     have gone so far as to alter or destroy the information in the
     computer system, or disrupt it's operation.

     Let's call a rose and rose, and a criminal a criminal.


     Where It Hurts Most --

     Since I clearly fit the original ( and positive ) definition of
     hacker, I am a little miffed at this new negative connotation.
     Nearly everyone in this network, who has worked to fit together
     the programs necessary to function with this Network, usually
     without documentation ( trial and error approach ), is a
     hacker in the most positive sense.

     When this modern criminal of the computer variety starts giving
     my hobby a bad name, I can do little but try to educate the
     uninformed.  Like with the VIRUS scares of late, it's hard to
     set the record straight about the merits of a BBS.

     PREACHING TO THE CHOIR mode on :
     The real problem now is that in trying to stamp out criminal
     activities, the law enforcement and regulatory groups are going
     to affect my hobby.  Not, as some would suggest, by
     confiscation of equipment or outright banishment, but in
     increased costs and hassle.  When my pocketbook gets hit, I
     start yelling.
