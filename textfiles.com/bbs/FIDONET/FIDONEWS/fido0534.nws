     =================================================================

               Hitch Hikers Guide to the Bylaws Amendments.

     Please read the entire message.

          1. 0001- A.  NO.  It puts an untested and unused policy in
             the bylaws and in definitions.  Definitions are not for
             procedures and policy.  BAD amendment.

          2. 0002- B.  NO.  Gives all sysops the "right" to vote
             without ever paying dues.  Why would anyone join?  Other
             problems:  who amends bylaws.  Why give power to non
             members if IFNA has no power over them?  If you like
             that idea, please vote for 0002 E!

          3. 0002- E.  Called the Bacon- Jordan- Perilleo Amendment.
             It gives the organization half over to non paying sysops.
             Okay, IF IFNA retains responsibility for FidoNet.
             Otherwise, why bother?  NO RECOMMENDATION, but
             acceptable.

          4. 0004.  Sets dues within bylaws.  No recommendation,
             acceptable.

          5. 0006.  Fees.  IFNA has been poor for quite a while and
             with the number of directors we have, IFNA is not going
             to be sugar daddy.  Yes, but no affect.

          6. 0018- B.  NO.  Gives seats on directors for members of
             Alternet, GoodEgg.  1.  We have more than enough
             directors and nets now.  2.  Why give multiple votes to
             a single person?

          7. 0020-  A and B.  Ahhh. . . this is interesting.
             Proposition A assumes that the VP TC has nothing to do
             with nodelist (not IC).  Proposition B clarifies old
             bylaws state that the VP TC is IC.  Recommendation (no
             surprise) - B.  Otherwise the VP TC and IFNA do nothing.

          8. Remember if you vote for A, be consistent with other
             votes.

          9. Grievance committee.  Yes.  A committee can only report
             and suggest to the board.

          10. Zones.  ???  You call it.  (I do not like the idea
              tho'.)

          11. Others are moderately safe and sane.

     You can vote on bylaws for IFNA.  Why should you bother?  What
     are the real issues?  You need some background and opinions.

     I got involved before and after Colorado Springs.  I wrote a
     draft set of bylaws to get things started.  And now...  I get
     ahead of the story.


     A. Background

     In the beginning, we had no rules.  Policy was open "Do it my
     way or leave."  There was no IFNA.  The International
     Coordinator(s) formed IFNA so that they could receive support
     without tax consequences.  The IC needed support.  It may be
     okay to do that job for 50, 200, or maybe 500.  When the list
     goes over 2,000 including international nodes, it becomes too
     much for one person.

     We had a meeting in Colorado Springs.  Depending on your point of
     view, there was a revolt by some "flamers" OR the founders of
     IFNA blew it.  Both points have merit.

     After FidoCon, I decided that no one else was going to write the
     bylaws so I sat down and did a ROUGH draft!  We formed a
     committee.  EchoMail committees don't work.  We met in Nashua,
     NH.  We came up with another, different draft.  We were to go
     home to revise the rough parts.

     The BoD of IFNA put that draft to a vote against our complaints.
     The bylaw's committee wanted to clean it up, but there was no
     final draft.  What you see today, should have been cleaned up
     before the first vote.  Why?  There are too many directors and
     ambiguities.  The procedures are terrible.  Since
     then I have had many suggestions and even final drafts of
     bylaws.


     Now here is the dilemma.  You have multiple amendments to
     consider. THE proposals are conflicting.  They are written by
     various people who disagree.  DO NOT APPROVE EVERY ONE.  Some
     sound better than they will taste.

     Some sysops are trying the middle ground.  Real danger!  Why? If
     there are problems in any of FidoNet, then IFNA is supposed to
     help.  Our first response is an argument over what is our
     territory.  If FidoNet is successful, then credit goes to *C's,
     no one joins IFNA.  No one joins IFNA -> no support for *C's.

     If you try to please everyone by fuzzy thinking, you please
     no one.

     THE ISSUES:  Does IFNA control the FidoNet?  How much?  How?  No
     one suggests that IFNA try to enforce day-to-day control of
     fidonet.  If IFNA does not control, can it and should it
     support?  If IFNA does not control, then who does?  Is IFNA
     international?  Are we an American organization that
     FidoNews 5-34                Page 3                   22 Aug 1988


     allows foreigners to join, but leave them out?  How can we
     integrate our international friends?


     How does it all fit?  Try to follow my logic.

     A. The FidoNet Sysops need a coordinator system(*C's) to :

          1. Maintain a nodelist with unique numbers.
          2. Process and expedite netmail.
          3. Develop standards so that net mail and echomail function.
          4. Make FidoNews available.
          5. Help them setting up their BBS.

     B. The *C's need IFNA to:

          1. Raise money to support financially the FidoNet Sysops
             and the *C's.
          2. Sanction the Technical Committee.
          3. Protect the *C's from legal challenges.
          4. Protect the copyright of the nodelist for the benefit of
             the FNS.
          5. Interface with the world.  IFNA is a corporation and a
             legal entity and the *C's are not.  The *C's cannot enter
             into contracts or apply for copyrights.

     C. IFNA needs the support of the FidoNet Sysops to:

          1. Sell memberships.  No memberships -=> no money -=> no
             IFNA.
          2. Without membership, no feedback from the Sysops and IFNA
             cannot lead without feedback and legitimacy.

     D. IFNA needs the *C's to:

          1. Operate the net by maintaining the weekly nodelist and
             adjudicate differences within the FNS and *C's.
          2. Develop rules for operation of the net (policy).

     E. To protect and finance the *C's (see above) and to protect the
        interest of its members, IFNA needs a strong link to the
        nodelist.  Without that link, membership shall decline and
        better leaders shall abandon IFNA.  Therefore, FULLY
        RESPECTING THE OPINIONS OF THE *C's, IFNA shall:

          1. Elect the VP TC.  The VP TC shall either be the IC or
             appoint someone to be the IC.
          2. Adopt policy as recommended by the VP TC without making
             unreasonable amendments.

     F. To protect its administrative function, the *C's shall:

          1. Advise IFNA of their choice of VP TC and their version
             of Policy.
          2. Retain the right to severe its relationship with IFNA.
             Severing its relationship with IFNA may have a negative
     FidoNews 5-34                Page 4                   22 Aug 1988


             effect upon the Sysops of the FidoNet.
             Therefore, the *C's shall get a vote from those sysops
             before the separation.

     G. All the above is consistent with common sense and now accepted
        documents and require no amendments to bylaws nor policy.
        Therefore, be it resolved that:

          1. IFNA is the official organization of the FidoNet sysops.
             IFNA supports the operation of that Net.
          2. IFNA grants the *C's authority and wide discretion to
             administer the FidoNet.

               EchoList - The EchoMail Conference List

     I got a reasonable critique recently, essentially asking why
     waste telephone time and paper on those ancillary reference
     files published with the EchoList, when they were basically
     redundant to the ELISTnnn.TXT file?

     It was a reasonable question, and I hope I provided a
     reasonable answer.  Having done so, however, I thought it
     might be a good idea to expand on my last article about the
     EchoList by providing everyone with that explanation of
     what's in the EchoList distribution, and why.

     Currently, the ELISTnnn.ARC file includes four files:

       ELISTnnn.TXT - The full, detailed EchoList
       ELISTnnn.MOD - The Moderator cross-reference report
       ELISTnnn.NAM - The cross-reference by Symbolic Area Name
       ELISTnnn.ARM - An abbreviated Conference list with all
                      primary and alternate Moderators

     I added the additional cross references over that last few
     months as responses to specific needs.  The .TXT file is the
     authoritative listing.  It contains all information except
     the alternate moderators.  The reason that certain entries
     do not display the Symbolic Area Name is that the Moderator
     of that conference has requested that it not be disclosed--
     for security from hackers, or whatever.  I just list what
     moderators provide.

     The other listings are meant as short cross references
     and/or different sort orders.  I agree that it's unfortunate
     that it adds something to the phone time.  But, of course,
     there is no reason to print them if you don't want them.

     The .MOD is important to Moderators since all conferences
     are listed in order of Moderator name.  They can find all
     listings active for them in short order.

     The .NAM is needed because the primary .TXT listing is
     sorted by Title, and some moderators chose Titles that sort
     to useless places.  If you want to know more about the FLIRT
     echo, it's easy to find in .NAM; but would be down in the
     W's (for "Where men and women can Flirt") in the main list.
     Also, ONLY conferences with published Symbolic Area Names
     are in this listing.

     The .ARM was only recently added, and it's the most
     superfluous as far as I'm concerned.  It was added to kill
     two stones with one bird.  First, some conferences want to
     list multiple Moderators, and I would have had a problem
     adding them to the .TXT listing without wasting a lot of
     space for the vast majority of conferences.  So, they are
     FidoNews 5-34                Page 6                   22 Aug 1988


     listed ONLY in .ARM.

     Second, it was added as a result of a critique just opposite
     to the message I mentioned earlier in the article.  The .TXT
     file has gotten so long and time consuming to print, that a
     summary 'index' of sorts was needed.  So .ARM is actually
     the only file anyone would 'have' to print to see a complete
     conference listing by title. Then you could browse the .TXT
     file on disk for more information if you wanted it.  It
     bothers me that it's so redundant, but I figured more
     options meant better ease of use... so there it is.

     If you're interested, you can file request "ELISTMOD" from
     1:1/201 to get documentation on what options Moderators have
     for submitting entries in the EchoList; and instructions on
     how to submit an entry if you Moderate a conference
     yourself.  And "ECHOLIST" will always get you the most
     recent EchoList itself.

                                Enjoy,
                        And have fun with it!

                           Is KidsNews Dying?

     The  following  will  be  included  in  the  next edition of
     KidsNews. It is here now for your edification:

     The  KidsNews  staff  has  undergone  some  major changes in how
     the KidsNews newsletter is published. I am Brandy's  Dad  and  I
     got involved because KidsNews seemed to be headed in a direction
     that was not consistant with the goals as stated in KidsNews.A04
     two months ago. Also, there was a lack of reader contribution in
     any  form which has hurt the newsletter tremendously. It is just
     not possible for a 13 year old  kid to  publish  the  newsletter
     and  then distribute it independantly without some contributions
     to enhance its continuance. She was expected to pay for paper to
     print it for "Snail Mail" subscriptions and the stamps  to  mail
     it.  She was expected to pay the phone bills for mailing through
     the Fido (tm) Network system. And she was expected  to  continue
     to  keep  a  grade  average  in school that was of an acceptable
     standard to her Mom and I. This may not seem like much  to  some
     people,  but  it just didn't pan out for her. She even asked the
     Sysops  of  some  systems  to  help  her  in  distributing   the
     newsletter  and from some she got the reply "Its not financially
     within  my  capability".  There  is   some   finances   involved
     appearantly  to  this  newsletter  business. I wish I could help
     also and I have to the point of paying her bills as DONATIONS to
     her cause. Now I need help also.

     Then again, maybe it was a bit much, considering the  amount  of
     contributions  sent  through  various  medium like the "National
     KIDS  Echo  Conference",  Fido  (tm)  NetMail  messages,  direct
     mailing  capabilities  (her post office box which she had to pay
     for), and last but not least, direct link into Seguaro BBS for a
     chat. None of  which  materialized  over  a  six  month  period.
     Oh,  there were about three jokes, a handful of trivia, and some
     birthdays, that made it  through  the  connections  to  100/525.
     However,  all  the  "Articles" were composed manually by Brandy.
     This required a lot of time on her part. So,  come  on  and  get
     those  articles in. If by chance there were some items that were
     submitted via the echo for inclusion into the  newsletter,  they
     never  made  it  to  100/525.  Please  bring  it  to the Editors
     attention when you want something included by adding a  sentence
     that  says  "Please include in KidsNews". It will be done if the
     message gets  to  our  Bulletin  Board.  We  have  "Crash  Mail"
     capability. As you can see from the above, contributions may not
     necessarily mean monitary in nature.  Her  compiling and writing
     the articles, thinking of games to add, contest, trivia, and all
     the items that comprise the newsletter was a burden also.

     There was one contest which is still running. Contributed by the
     good  folks  at FIREPLUG I, (Fido 1:322/710.0). Mr Kevin Sinksen
     submitted the contest which  is  listed  below  in  reguards  to
     National  Fire  Prevention Week. Its an essay contest which will
     enhance our childrens safety when it comes to fires. A  noteable
     FidoNews 5-34                Page 10                  22 Aug 1988


     gesture  on  Mr.  Sinksens  part  in  enhancing  the  future and
     longevity of our children. Please  get  your child  involved  in
     these projects and contest. Thier life may depend on some of it.
     Thank  you Mr. Sinksen for the nice contribution to the kids and
     KidsNews.

     The  last  KidsNews  was sent out with a subscription form in an
     attempt to recoupe some of  the  loss  encountered  during  this
     endeavor  to  provide  the  kids around this great nation with a
     publication that they could have a say in, submit  articles  in,
     even  run  a  column  in.  This  i'm  sad  to say was possibly a
     redundant idea since the echo seemed to  provide  all  that  was
     needed.  To  those  of you  who used the subscription form, your
     funds will be returned to you unless you  state  that  it  is  a
     DONATION to help KidsNews continue. To those of you who have not
     contributed,  we  will  run a FEW more editions to allow you the
     opportunity to do so. Again, the address is:

     Claude F. Witherspoon
     P.O Box 8045
     Granite City, IL 62040-8045

     There will be no subscription attached to this newsletter.  Only
     a  request  for  donations  for  its continuance. We at KidsNews
     appologize to those that we have confused, burdened in any  way,
     or flat made mad by our inability to predict the human nature.

     This article is submitted by me with Brandy's permission and  is
     in  no way her idea for generating an income. I just didn't like
     to see her worry over something that may be of  no  interest  to
     the  public as a whole. Then again maybe it is. We will find out
     by  your  involvement.  Brandy is not asking for much, just some
     participation by you for the kids around the country. Who knows,
     maybe even for the kids in other countries as well?

     Thank you ever so much for your time. I hope that I  have  given
     some  of  you an idea of what Brandy was up against and that you
     may see it in your heart  to  contribute  in  this  worth  while
     project  for not just Brandy, but the kids around the nation and
     over seas. Yes we are trying to get the publication to Australia
     and England. The echo is connected there and  it  should  be  an
     easy task to have everyone involved. We, can  with your support.
     I hope to be  communicating  with all of you in the kids echo or
     otherwise. Till then, "G'day" as they say in Australia.

                              New Echo: ADOPTEES

     There is a new echo available which offers helpful information
     for adoptees, birth parents and others.  Topics include:

          1) Discussion of legislation affecting adoptees,
             birth parents and adoptive parents.

          2) How, when and where to search.

          3) Agencies that offer help to adoptees or parents
             searching for relatives.

          4) Inquires from adoptees, birth parents and siblings,
             using as much information as is available to them
             concerning the person they are searching for.

     This is an ideal companion echo for those people already
     carrying the genealogical conference.  If you are interested
     in this echo, it is available thru the REGION 11 co-ordinator,
     and can easily be passed to other regional co-ordinators.

     If you would like to take a look at the echo, you can read it
     on my board, Treasure Chest BBS, at (219) 287-4326.  If you
     have any questions, I will be happy to answer net mail.
