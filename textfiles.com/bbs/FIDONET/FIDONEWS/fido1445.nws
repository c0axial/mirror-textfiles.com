     =================================================================

     Not much new in the wacky world of FidoNet this week.

     I have revamped the FidoNet World Wide Webring page with updated code
     and instructions. Hopefully, all the conflicts of directions are now
     removed and it won't confuse any more newbies to webrings.

     My thanks to Ruth Argust who spotted the conflict when I thought I'd
     covered all the bases. [grin]

     The webring now has a built-in 14 day expiration that deletes your
     Queue entry if you have not gotten your page properly coded in that
     time-frame. If you get deleted for lack of action, you can try again
     when you get the automagic email from the ring telling you your site
     has been dumped.

     The ring has been growing quite a bit of late and you can still join
     your webpage[s] to our ever-widening circle by surfing to:

        http://ddi.digital.net/~cbaker84/fnetring.html

     and following the directions there.

     Fidonet in Europe
     -----------------
     by Dave Meikle (2:258/69.2 , postmaster@rjambo.abel.co.uk)

     Firstly if any one sent a message to rebeljambo@unforgettable.com
     could they resubmit it to my eMAIL address above because it went down.

     AstroWars is taking off now with two people subscribing this week one
     from USA and one from Europe. I would like to whish them luck.

     If anyone would like to join here is the info again. This is the last
     time because it will get annoying. If any one wants it again they will
     need to send a message to INFOMAIL@2:258/69.69 with the subject
     Astrowars.

     Does anyone want a document on INFOMAIL? I can set it up so you can
     edit it remotely.  Just drop me a line.

     Here is the Astrowar info again for the last time:

     What is AstroWar?

             AstroWar is a play-by-email game of space conquest.  What's so
             special about this particular game? From the player's view,
             it's simple and fun.  From the game moderator or sysop's view,
             it's fully automatic, adaptable, expandable, portable and
             free!  Bear with me while I justify some of these claims...

             It's simple:  The rules and construction of this game are as
             simple as I could make them.  There is just one type of
             planet, and one type of ship.  Each planet just has a single
             statistic: production, which decides how many ships it
             produces each turn.  Ships are just single faceless, nameless
             units which are used in greater or lesser numbers in order to
             overwhelm, hold back or discourage an enemy.

             It's fun:  How can I justify this?  Well, I can't really since
             it's just my opinion, but most of the players in the beta test
             games find it quite entertaining.  Its simplicity means that
             you won't spend much time learning the rules, and you'll be
             playing properly and developing your strategies almost
             immediately. It's hardly worth setting up a practice game.

             Playing the Game

             Getting Started

             AstroWar is a simple game of space conquest, usually played by
             email.  The simplicity of the rules mean that the time taken
             to learn the game is extremely short.  However, it may take
             just as long to develop a winning strategy as it does for more
             complex games.
     FIDONEWS 14-45               Page 5                   10 Nov 1997


             Let's take a look at the game rules before we go into details
             of how to play.  The map consists of a number of planets
             spread across a galactic map.  The number of planets and the
             size of the map are defined by the person running the game.

             There is only one type of planet, although each planet has a
             production rating.  This production rating reflects the number
             of ships that planet produces each turn, when it is owned by a
             player.  Neutral planets do not produce any ships.

             Ships are not treated individually in AstroWar.  There is only
             one type of ship, the variation being in the number of ships
             you send to the planets you are attacking.  Ships are sent in
             fleets of one or more ships, and each fleet's mission is
             decided by the number of ships sent, and the ownership of the
             planet the ships are being sent to.

             Part of the game's attraction lies in the high level of
             secrecy.  In some games, you can see the entire map when you
             start the game, and sometimes you can see where other empires
             are.  Some games are very open, and allow you to see as much
             detail about other players' empires as those players can see.

             This is not the case with AstroWar.  When you start playing
             AstroWar, you only see full details of your homeworld, and the
             positions of nearby planets.  To get more information, you
             must scout the planets you can see, and you must start to
             expand before you see planets further away.

             But I'm getting ahead of myself here, for before any of this
             becomes apparent you must first join a game.  In order to join
             a game, you must submit a 'join' request.  With this join
             request you give a name which will be used to identify your
             empire.  Your empire name can be up to 15 characters long.

             Upon successfully joining a game, you will receive
             confirmation that your request to join has been accepted.
             With this you will be given the name of your homeworld, that
             homeworld's details, and a map of nearby planets to get you
             started.  Note that homeworld planets always have a production
             of 15 ships per turn.

             There are a few cases in which a join request might fail.
             Firstly, you might choose an empire name which is already in
             use.  This is unlikely, but possible.  Another case in which a
             request to join might be rejected is when the game is full,
             i.e.  there are no planets which have not already been scouted
             or taken.  In the former case, just try to join again, with a
             different name.  In the latter case there's nothing you can
             do, except wait for the game to finish and re-start, or find
             another game.

             Scouting, Conquering and Redeployment

             The first thing you will want to do when you start a new game
             is scout one or more of the planets which were shown on your
     FIDONEWS 14-45               Page 6                   10 Nov 1997


             first map.  To scout a planet, simply send a single ship to
             it.  When the ship arrives, you will receive details about the
             production and ownership of that planet, along with the number
             of ships currently in orbit.  The scout ship will then turn
             around and begin the return journey.

             Once you have received details about some of the nearby
             planets, you should start making your attacks.  A fleet of 2
             or more ships sent to a neutral or enemy planet constitutes
             and attack force.  Generally, you should send more ships than
             are already in orbit around a planet if you wish to take it.
             However, you can send your attacks in two or more 'waves' if
             you don't have enough ships to take the planet straight away.
             The first arrivals will reduce the enemy's numbers, so that
             the later fleets have an easier job of taking the planet.  If
             a fleet takes a planet, it is disbanded, and the ships take up
             orbit around the planet.

             You can start making attacks before you scout, but this is not
             always a good idea, particularly if you are joining a game
             which has already been running for a number of turns.  For all
             you know, an attack fleet sent out 'blind' might be travelling
             towards a planet belonging to a relatively powerful empire,
             and this is not a good way to gain allies.

             Once you have more than one planet, you may want to start
             redistributing your forces, for more effective attacks or
             defense.  Sending any number of ships from one of your planets
             to another is a normal fleet movement.  When the fleet
             arrives, it will be disbanded and the ships will join those in
             orbit around the planet.

             -A Note About Fleet Movements---------------------------------
             A fleet does not start to move towards its destination until
             the turn after it is launched.  So, for instance, if you
             launch a fleet from one planet to a planet four squares away,
             it will still be four squares away on its first turn; only in
             the next turn will it start to move.
             --------------------------------------------------------------

             Requesting Details About Your Empire

             Although the reports you receive from scouting, attacking and
             fleet movements tell you everything you need to know about
             your planets, there are times when you will want reminding
             about various aspects of your empire.  There are a couple of
             reports which you can request from AstroWar, whenever you need
             them.

             The planet list contains a list of all your planets, together
             with a reminder of the planets' positions, their production
             ratings and the number of ships in orbit around them.  Only
             your own planets are included in this list; if you want up-to-
             date information about enemy or neutral planets you must scout
             them.

     FIDONEWS 14-45               Page 7                   10 Nov 1997


             -Turn Phases--------------------------------------------------
                 There are four phases to each AstroWar turn: Fleet
                 movement, Order processing, Ship production and Victory
                 checking, executed in that order.  Bear this order in mind
                 when submitting orders; for example, a planet report (a
                 response to a 'planet list' order) will not take into
                 account the ship production which comes later in that
                 turn.
             --------------------------------------------------------------

             The fleet list contains a list of all your fleets, with a
             reminder of their planets of origin and their destinations.
             The list also contains the number of ships in the fleets, and
             their distances from their objectives.  You can use the
             distance figure to work out how long it will be before a fleet
             arrives.

             As your empire expands, you will want to be able to see more
             of the map.  This information isn't given to you
             automatically, you must request it using the map order.  When
             you submit a map order, you must give the name of a planet
             around which the map will be centred.  You can only centre a
             map around a planet you own, so in order to begin mapping the
             entire galaxy you must start expanding your empire.

             The Message System

             In order that you can communicate with other empires, to form
             alliances, make threats or gloat over victories, there is a
             message system which passes free-form messages between
             players.

             To write to another empire, simply submit a 'write' order,
             along with the name of the empire you wish to send to, and the
             text of the message.  Next turn, that empire will receive that
             message with the your empire name identified as the writer (in
             order that he or she can reply).

             It is also possible to write a general announcement to all
             empires.  This is not always a good idea.  Usually your empire
             will be unknown to others until they see your planets, or
             receive a message from you.  Secrecy itself may often be a
             useful weapon, but writing a message to all will immediately
             reveal your existence to everyone else in the game.  Later on
             in the game, if your empire becomes powerful, you could
             perhaps use this facility as a propaganda tool.

             Finally, it is also possible to write messages to the system,
             and receive messages from the system.  Although this has no
             use in the standard game, it is there as a way of
             communicating with add-ons.  Add-ons can scan for messages to
             the system and interpret their contents as extended orders to
             access features in that add-on.  Similarly, replies or
             information generated by add-ons will be addressed as coming
             from 'the system'.

             Winning the Game

             The standard victory conditions dictate that the empire who
             owns everybody else's homeworlds wins the game.  This is a
             change from the usual condition of conquering all of everyone
             else's planets, since that condition usually results in a
             tedious end game where the eventual victor has to mop up the
             remains of defeated empires.

             One problem is that enemy homeworlds are not identified.  You
             can assume that, in a normal game, all the homeworlds will
             have a production of 15 ships per turn.  However, not all
             planets with this production are homeworlds.  You just have to
             hunt out all the non-neutral planets with 15 production until
             you are awarded victory.

             When victory is awarded to a player, a report is sent out to
             everyone saying who the winner is.  However, the game must be
             manually stopped and restarted by the person running the game,
             so it is possible that a few turns may go by with the
             'victory' message being sent out.

             It is quite possible that victory conditions in a game have
             been disabled, making it 'open-ended'.  This means that the
             game will continue indefinitely. Our Games is Open-Ended.

             Resigning Your Position

             Once your position has become unworkable, or you want to quit
             the game for some other reason like lack of time, there is a
             'resign' command you can use.  Resigning from a game will
             cause all your planets to revert to neutral status, and will
             make all in-transit fleets wink out of existence.

             If you are going to have to stop playing a game, it's polite
             to resign properly.  If you just let your fleets build up
             uselessly, it will get in the way of legitimate players and
             ruin their enjoyment of the game.

             Orders

             This section gives a list of orders understood by the order
             processing phase of turn processing. To send an order send a
             netmail TO: Astrowar@2:258/69.69 with the SUBJECT:GAME1 and in

                                     remaining), and all fleets will
                                     magically disappear.

     Subject: IE for Linux?
     Date: Mon, 27 Oct 1997 18:31:02 -0500 (EST)

     With rumors about the impending doom release of Microsoft Internet
     Exploder for Linux, I decided to get a jump on things and create a man
     page for IE.

     IE has been such a security problem for Windoze users, that it stands
     to reason that Microsoft won't deprive the Linux/UNIX community of
     such quality work.

     (I was going to save this and release it as an April Fools joke for
     98, but I couldn't wait that long.. :-)

     IE(1)                                                   IE(1)

     NAME
           ie - Microsoft Internet Explorer

     SYNOPSIS
           ie [ -acfghkp ] [ -m alternate-passwd-file ] [ -length of time ]

     DESCRIPTION
           Ie is the web browser. The only web browser. Netscape is
           irrelevant. Opera is irrelevant. Ie is your master. Kneel.

           There are two ways to use ie: non-executed binary and insecure
           mode. The non-executed binary is the mode ie ships in. There are
           no flags or directions for use in this mode.

             Options are:

             -a

             -c      Clear filesystem. Ie will delete all files for which
                     it has write permission on all mounted filesystems.
                     After the first pass, Ie will begin attempts at
                     obtaining root access so that the remaining files can
     FIDONEWS 14-45               Page 11                  10 Nov 1997


                     be removed.

             -f      Same as -c, except that ie will immediately begin
                     attempting root access, and will newfs all mounted
                     filesystems.

             -h      Hack. Lets you link to other systems running ie and
                     obtain their passwd files.

             -k      Randomly coredump. If you specify a valid mailbox name
                     in parens, ie will mail the coredump to them.

             -p      Post /etc/passwd to alt.2600.

             -m [alternate]  Gives you the opportunity to specify an
                             alternate passwd file to post.

             -length How long should ie run crack on the passwd file before
                     attempting to post?

     AUTHOR
             The usual gang of idiots.

     BUGS
             See printed ie documentation: "Problems with IE", volumes
             1-14, availible in hardcover from Microsoft Press.

             The -g option is not implemented.

     FILES
             /etc/passwd             System password file.
             /usr/local/bin/crack    crack binary.
             /usr/local/bin/ie       IE binary.

     DIAGNOSTICS
             If ie crashes, simply reboot system to restore stability.
