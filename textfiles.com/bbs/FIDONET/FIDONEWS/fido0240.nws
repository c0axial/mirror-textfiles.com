                                In Pursuit of PCs


          What's the big deal, here?  Maybe I'm missing something.  So
          GTE is selling a service aimed at BBS users.  So?  Don't you
          want users to call your board?

          If you often call boards far  away,  then  I'd  think  you'd
          welcome  the  chance to access them for a low flat rate.  If
          you're a sysop, I'd think you'd appreciate the influx of new
          blood from distant places.  My normal monthly phone bill  is
          in the hundreds of dollars;  I'd welcome anything that would
          lower it.  As for our users,  our board has callers from all
          over the country,  and even from Europe, and I love it.  How
          they manage to reach  us  doesn't  really  seem  to  make  a
          difference.

          So  how is GTE different from AT&T?  After all,  Ma Bell has
          been making tons of money off of us for years!  I've  lately
          heard  a rumor that BBSers were/are the making of the "Reach
          Out America Plan"  (after  all,  who  else  is  making  long
          distance calls at that time of night?),  and nobody seems to
          be getting upset about  it.  In  fact,  the  Fido  community
          seems to have lovingly embraced the ROAP,  since that's when
          netmail takes place.

          So  why the uproar?  I figure that it must be because GTE is
          providing a service specifically  targeted  at  BBSers,  who
          aren't  used to it.  We've always been considered a marginal
          market,  whether we are  or  not.  Oh,  USR  is  offering  a
          special   deal  to  sysops,   but  that's  different;   it's
          favoritism.

          Everybody uses phones,  and even Aunt Nellie can use ROAP on
          Sunday,  but only BBSers will really use PC  Pursuit.  We're
          so used to being the ghetto of the computer community that I
          guess  it's  uncomfortable  to  realize  that we've become a
          significant market segment.  It's quite a change from  being
          a frowned-upon bunch of hackers.

          This list was compiled from responses to a proposal I submitted
          to the FIDONEWS.  I know there are more distribution nodes than
          this, but these are the ones that responded.  My thanks to those
          of you listed here.  If you are a distribution node, and would
          like to be added to this list, send the relevant information to
          the SYSOP on 109/74 - The Bear's Den.  I will release updates to
          this list as new distribution nodes are added.

          PC Pursuit Fido                                 Nov. 8, 1985

               GTE Telenet's PC Pursuit HELPS BBS and Fido systems

          Regarding an article written in last weeks'Fidonews,
          (11/4/85), GTE TELENET HAS PAID THE $100 FEE TO TOM JENNINGS
          FOR COMMERCIAL USE OF FIDO.  This payment was made a month
          BEFORE the article appeared in which the author mistakenly
          accused GTE Telenet of copyright infringement.  Payment was
          made as soon as the required fee and address were clarified
          with the release of Fido version 11.

          GTE Telenet is pleased to be using the Fido software to run
          the User Guide for PC Pursuit -- probably one of the only
          800 BBS numbers in the country (It's great - try it!
          800-835-3001).  We found the Fido software to be very
          helpful in giving users information about Pursuit; Fido is
          easy to install, maintain, and easy to use.

          Unfortunately, the author of the article last week alledges
          that PC Pursuit was established to exploit BBS's/sysops and
          to exploit Fido.  AU CONTRAIRE!  GTE Telenet developed PC
          Pursuit because the market for PC communications is growing
          rapidly and there are hundreds of thousands of modem users
          who want to communicate long-distance but could not cost-
          effectively do so prior to PC Pursuit.  Ask most sysops and
          PC modem users if they would like to have unlimited long-
          distance access to any phone number in major cities for just
          $25 per month (evenings and weekends - which is 67% of the
          168 hours in a week).  The answer is a resounding YES.
          Response to PC Pursuit has been tremendous -- we get
          thousands of calls for service each week.  Most sysops also
          welcome calls from far away places since this brings in new
          and interesting users and files.

          Since we began the Fido BBS as a User Guide for PC Pursuit,
          we have also had many inquiries about Fido and how others
          can set up their own Fido BBS's or access other Fido
          systems.  We have recommended many users to check with Tom
          Jennings BBS in Calif. and to access various other Fido
          systems, and we will continue to recommend Fido as a well
          designed BBS and networking system.

          GTE Telenet's PC Pursuit currently services 12 major cities
          across the U.S., but expansion will soon occur to many more
          cities throughout 1986.  For more information about PC
          Pursuit, call a GTE Telenet representative at 800-368-4215,
          or call our Fido BBS User Guide at 800-835-3001.

          I've only been running a Fido for a few months, but
          something I have run into again and again are utilitys that
          will not run properly if at all on my system. (an IBM AT)

          Nothing against the people that create the utilitys and make
          them available to the SysOps at large, but it would be very
          nice if the sources for some of these were made available so
          they could be re-compiled on systems that have problems with
          the supplied binarys.

          For general information, the primary offenders seem to be
          programs that are written in compiled Basic.  The earlier
          versions of the compiler are known to have problems on the
          AT, later versions are supposed to be corrected.

          Also, it would be nice if more of the SysOps would make it
          known when they run into a program or combination of
          utilitys that interfere with each other.

          An example, TIMELOG.EXE will not run properly on my system
          if GRAPHICS.COM is loaded.  A minor annoyance I'll admit,
          but I have a number of other programs that depend on the
          Graphics module being loaded so it's a frequent occurance.

          Please don't think that I'm saying this just to be a pest or
          to vent my frustrations, but I can't believe that I'm the
          only person that have had these problems.

          By the way, this whole tirade was prompted when I discovered
          that the current version of NODELIST.EXE will not run to
          completion on my system apparently due to the fact that it
          is written in compiled Basic.

          I may be moving the system to a different computer in the
          near future, so this may all become academic bafore this is
          read, but I figured that it should be said.

          Thanks - Jim Willing Fido 105/11

          Date:    11 Nov 85
          From:    David Drexler/Mark Grennan, sysops Fido 19/202
          Subject: Utility Programs

          We  have  written two programs that the rest of you  out  in
          Fidoland may find as useful as we have. They are dblside and
          mdmctrl.  Dblside (double-side) lets you prints doc files on
          both sides of the paper;  especially useful for lonnng  text
          files,  like  the  Fido newletters and other  documentation.
          Mdmctrl (modem-control) outputs whatever arguments you  give
          it on the command line,  to the modem.  We use it in the bbs
          batch file to make the modem go off-hook while we're "opping
          the sys" so that anyone trying to dial in gets a  busy,  and
          doesn't wonder whether our board has died.

          Both programs are written in the CI-C86 flavor of C. Dblside
          ought  to  compile  under most  anybody's  compiler,  as  it
          doesn't do anything particularly fancy,  but mdmctrl diddles
          the  interrupts and may have to be hacked to  compile  under
          another compiler.

          These  programs are available in both source-code and execu-
          table form, and may be downloaded from our system. New users
          on  our bbs are required to register before  downloading  or
          entering  messages;  we'll  get you updated within 48  hours
          (usually less than that, but not always!)

          Fido 138/27

                      RIPOFFS REVISITED -- WHAT WE CAN DO

          The issues raised by Paula Giese in Fidonews 2/38 are
          important ones that should be taken to heart by all BBS
          users.

          The service that GTE is offering is one that on the outside
          appears to benefit all users.  By providing an opportunity
          for users in the East to develop an access route to users
          in the West GTE is hooking up boards all across the country
          and speeding the spread of information to all of us.

          But the question remains:  Can the corporate sector use
          members of the private sector for profit, when the private
          sector doesn't want to be used?  And more importantly:
          Are we in the private sector, who already provide such a
          service for much less going to stand by and let it happen?

          Unfortunately, we can not do much.  The big money interests
          in this country have the private individual pretty much at
          a disadvantage.  But there are things we can do.

          First, sysops in the areas covered by PC Pursuit should
          call the information board at 1-800-835-3001 (which, by
          the way, is using Fido version  11 and has the temerity to
          call itself Node 1 / Net 1) and ask for the BBS listing.
          If your board is on the list, leave a message to the sysop
          asking them to take it off.  Many of these boards are
          Fido's, if we withdrew our support, they would have that
          much less to offer.

          The second, and most important thing, that Fido users can
          do, and this means every user, not just sysops, is
          education.  Over 8,000 people had called the PC Pursuit
          board the night I called.  I don't know how many of them
          signed up, but if only half of them did, that's 4,000
          people who didn't know about Fido.

          Let's face it, to make PC Pursuit worthwhile, you'd have to
          send 100 messages a month.  Even on the Fido I use, which
          charges a small access fee, I'd have to make 475 calls in a
          four month period to make the monthly charge and hook-up
          pay off.

          And note, there are only the 10 cities that  PC Pursuit can
          access, not the whole country as I can on Fido.  If more of
          the 8,000  callers knew this, PC Pursuit would be out of
          business and Fido-Net would be booming.

          Educating the general computer community about Fido is
          easy.  Just talk it up to anyone you know with a computer.
          Every BBS, not just Fido boards, should have a bulletin on
          it about PC Pursuit and its cost effective alternative,
          Fido-Net.  Make sure local computer stores know the number
          for the Fido boards in the area, because people who are

          new to town naturally inquire about that sort of thing
          first at a store.

          These things are at best a stop gap, as anyone who has ever
          tried to fight a big company knows.  And there will always
          be people who need the kind of service that PC Pursuit
          offers, and the ones who will demand to pay the most for a
          service,  believing in the lie that it has to be expensive
          to be good.  But the vast majority of the people will come
          quickly to see that user-supported BBSs, like the local
          boards where I live and the national Fido-Net, are where
          the true spirit of cooperation and  friendship lie.

                         FidoNet Route Files Explained
                    Part 3 -- Keep the Old, Ring In the New

                           by Ben Baker, Fido 100/76

               Last  week  we  looked  at the basic routing statements
          that have been with us since version  7  or  so.  Now  let's
          look at what's been added in version 11.

               Please refer back to last weeks  definitions.   I  con-
          tinue to use them as defined.

          RECV-ONLY

               This tells Fido "Go ahead and  build  packets  for  any
          targets  in  the SCHEDULE command's <target list>, but DON'T
          ATTEMPT TO CALL ANYBODY.  If any targets happen to  call  in
          for  any  reason, try to give them their packets before they
          get away."

               There  MUST  be  a  <target list> for this statement to
          mean anything.  It is not  intended  for  normally  "receive
          only"  schedules  like 202/0's collection schedule (see last
          week).  Instead, it  prevents  you  from  originating  calls
          during  schedules  when you are trying to SEND mail.  (Route
          files control how you send mail, not how  you  receive  it.)
          You  are  really  trying  to  send  mail  on the other guy's
          nickel, but as you will see, he has  to  cooperate  in  that
          venture.

               This  statement  might be used by the locals during the
          collection schedule in a large, busy  net.   Collisions  are
          avoided  because  there's  only one node, the outbound host,
          placing calls.  He POLLs (see below) the  locals  for  their
          outgoing traffic.

          HOLD <hold target list>

               "OK, Fido, build packets for  targets  in  the  <target
          list>,  but  don't  attempt  to actually call any targets in
          <hold target list>." This is a limited "RECV-ONLY"  command.
          Any  packets  for  targets not in <hold target list> will be
          sent normally (if they haven't been picked up), but  packets
          for <hold target list> have to be "picked up."

               There's  a  hidden  gimmick  here  that  bears  further
          exploration.   Ken  Kaplan  (Fido  100/22  AKA  1/0)  is the
          original  source  in  the  national  nodelist   distribution
          system.   Regional  coordinators  call his Fido each week to
          pick up copies of the latest nodelist.  The route  file  for
          his  national  window contains the statement "HOLD <regional
          coordinator list>."  Fido  will  not  attempt  to  send  any
          packets  targetted  for  a  regional coordinator.  Does this
          mean  that  he  can't  send   "normal"   messages   to   the


          Fidonews                   Page  9               18 Nov 1985





          coordinators?   Not  at  all.  Because he is a member of net
          100, all his "normal" messages, including those addressed to
          the  coordinators, wind up in a packet targetted for 100/10,
          the outbound host.  Since 100/10 is not in the <hold  target
          list>,  that  packet  is sent and the messages go out.  HOLD
          APPLIES TO THE TARGETS OF PACKETS, NOT TO THE ADDRESSEES  OF
          MESSAGES!   It  is  only  when  Ken  sends  messages  to the
          coordinators with the nodelist (or other files) attached  to
          them  that Fido builds packets targetted for them instead of
          100/10.

               Does that mean that Ken  can't  send  the  coordinators
          other files without waiting for them to pick them up?  Well,
          yes and no.  Because of the HOLD  statement,  he  can't  say
          send  FIDO_IBM.EXE to 14/61 (see PICK-UP below for why 14/61
          and not  14/0).   But  he  can  use  another  gimmick.   The
          coordinators have dual identities (set by the '4' command of
          Fido) and he can certainly send a file  to  14/0.   Fido  is
          smart,  but so smart he'll notice that 14/0 and 14/61 happen
          to have the same phone number.  He'll send  the  packet  for
          14/0 and hold the one for 14/61.  By the same token, if both
          packets are still present when 14/61 calls  in,  he'll  only
          pick up the the nodelist targetted for 14/61 and not the new
          Fido targetted for 14/0.  (You can't have your cake and  eat
          it too.)

          PICKUP <pickup target list>

               Whenever any other Fido calls your Fido for any reason,
          your Fido looks to see if there is a  packet  targetted  for
          him.  If there is, your Fido will try to deliver it then and
          there and avoid making the phone call which you have to  pay
          for.   Without this statement (or the next one) in his route
          file, the other Fido will simply hang up on you, leaving you
          with  a  phone call to make in order to deliver your packet.
          This statement says to Fido  "If  you  happen  to  call  any
          target in <pickup target list>, hang around to see if he has
          mail for me."

               This  is  a  two-edged  sword.   It  can  speed up mail
          exchange, but the Fido that places the call pays for it.  It
          works  best  within a local net where the calls are all toll
          free anyway.  In fact, it won't work at all  between  larger
          nets  supported  by  distinct  inbound  and  outbound hosts.
          Specifying "PICKUP 100/0" in your national  window  schedule
          would  only get you messages originating on 100/0 (or 100/51
          actually) with files attached.  Any other mail for you might
          be in a packet addressed to you, but on 100/10, the outbound
          host, and that's not who you called.

               Even worse, let's say Tom Jennings is sending a file to
          100/10 and wants to pick up any mail from St.  Louis for San
          Francisco while he's at it.  He's the host of net  125,  and
          that's  perfectly  legitimate,  right?   Wrong!  His primary
          identity (the '4' command again) is  125/1  and  100/10  may
          have  a  packet  for  125/0,  but he won't have a packet for
          125/1.  This command deals at the packet/target  level  just
          as  the  HOLD command does.  Furthermore, it deals with real


          Fidonews                   Page 10               18 Nov 1985





          identities, not alternate identities.

               As I said, this is most useful within a local net,  and
          that's where it probably should be applied.

          POLL <poll target list>

               This  tells Fido "Even if I don't have any mail for the
          targets  in  <poll  target  list>  generate  empty   packets
          addressed  to them so you have an excuse to call them.  Then
          when you do call them, pick anything they have for me."

               "POLL <poll target list>" implies "PICKUP <poll  target
          list>"  which  need not be specified.  This is the statement
          an outbound host might use to poll his locals  or  hubs  for
          outgoing traffic prior to national mail time.  Together with
          the next statement, this method can be very efficient.

               The regional coordinators run a special  schedule  each
          Saturday morning  during  the  national  mail  window.  It's
          route  file  is  identical to their normal national schedule
          route file except that it contains the statement "POLL 1/0."
          That's how they  get  the  nodelist  for  subsequent  redis-
          tribution.

               As I see it, POLL has a lot more uses than PICKUP.

          SEND-ONLY

               This  one  is  mainly for outbound hosts.  It says "I'm
          not expecting any mail during this schedule, so  don't  wait
          the  normal  one  or  two  minutes for incomming calls after
          making an outgoing call.  As soon as you  finish  one,  dial
          another until all packets have been sent."

               As  I  said  above,  this  can  be  very efficient, but
          there's a problem you need to be aware of.  Fido will make a
          maximum of 30 attempts without connect to send a packet to a
          particular target.  If you have only one packet addressed to
          a busy target, Fido would normally take about an hour to use
          up 30 attempts, but in SEND-ONLY  mode  he  can  attempt  30
          calls  in  about  20 minutes!  If you have a Courier and are
          running it  in  "X4"  response  code  mode,  he'll  make  30
          attempts  in 10 to 15 minutes.  (The Courier doesn't waste a
          lot of time in "fast-dial, busy-detect" mode.)

               If you're an outbound host and want  to  try  SEND-ONLY
          during  the  national  window,  you  risk using up your call
          attempts while  your  target  is  busiest,  then  when  he's
          quieted  down and you could get through, you've given up!  I
          suggest you break your national time into two schedules, and
          only  use  SEND-ONLY during the last 20 minutes or so of the
          national window.

               On  the  other  hand,  polling your locals or hubs is a
          different matter.  They should be in RECV-ONLY mode and  you
          can  expect  every  call to connect the first try.  The call
          attempt limit doesn't apply to this situation and the  SEND-


          Fidonews                   Page 11               18 Nov 1985





          ONLY  command  should  be used to shorten the time needed to
          POLL everyone.

          NO-ROUTE <addressee list>

               This command tells Fido "Do not send messages addressed
          to these nodes anywhere but to the addressed  nodes.   Treat
          them  as though they have files attached, whether they do or
          not."

               This lets you say things like Fido 100/76 (in Illinois)
          might:

          SEND-TO 100/10        ; Outbound Host (in Missouri)
          ROUTE-TO 100/10 ALL   ; Send everything to accross the river
          NO-ROUTE 100/482      ; Except other Illinois traffic

               The  only  other  way to achieve this end is to list in
          the ROUTE-TO command all 500 odd nodes whose messages should
          be routed to 100/10, and that list changes every week!

               Now  you  should have a good handle on how the commands
          used in ROUTE.<tag> control  how  Fido  SENDS  files  during
          schedule  <tag>.   But sometimes these commands require very
          long lists of node numbers which change from week to week as
          the  node  list  changes.  LISTGEN 2 will generate the route
          files automatically and  let  you  specify  the  long  lists
          symbolically  in terms of nets, area codes, etc..  Next week
          in  the  last  part  of  this  series,  we'll  see  how  the
          statements  in  LISTGEN's  ROUTE.CTL  file correspond to the
          commands in ROUTE.<tag>.

                  While madly typing away at my article last week, I
          made a somewhat misleading statement about GTE Telenet,
          something to the effect that I doubted whether GTE had
          really paid for the Fido they use.

                  Simply put, GTE has paid for their Fido, as
          previously mentioned.

                  I have always assumed that things I wrote here were
          "all in the family", that only FidoNet sysops and users read
          this junk, like being able to walk into your own living room
          naked. However, unbeknownst to me, there were guests in the
          living room!

            Change in NET for Austin and Central Texas Communications

            As of Nov 15, the only net for the Austin, Texas
          metropolitan area is net 136,  The  Central  Texas
          Professional  Communications  Net (CenTex_ProComm).  This
          net was originally a small group specializing in computer
          communications, but has become the only active Austin net.
          The net consists of nodes from the former net 103, region 19
          and several new nodes.  Those active nodes who formerly had
          a node number elsewhere have kept the same node number, but
          are now in net 136.  New nodes are being assigned numbers
          starting with 200.  This should be the last change in this
          area, and net communications for this area can now
          stabilize.

            If you have any questions regarding this net, Or any
          communications related problems, please contact the host
          board:
