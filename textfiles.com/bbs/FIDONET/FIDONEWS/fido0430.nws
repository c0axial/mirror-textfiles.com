     System Enhancement Associates, 107/6


                              * New Release *

                             SEAdog version 4.1


     System Enhancement Associates will soon be releasing version  4.1
     of  the  popular SEAdog network mail system.  The primary impetus
     behind SEAdog v4.1 was,  of course,  the large node list  compil-
     ation bug, which has now been fixed.  But while we were at it, we
     enhanced the SEAdog mail system in several ways:

      *  SEAlink with Overdrive; If you have a 9600 baud modem, you'll
         appreciate  this.   SEAlink's  new  Overdrive  is  especially
         geared to accomodate high speed half duplex  modems,  and  is
         capable  of  coming  within  4%  of  the  theoretical maximum
         thoughput.

      *  More than seventeen alternate message areas;  If you  are  an
         echomail junkey, then you're gonna love this!  SEAdog 4.1 can
         handle MANY more  alternate  message  areas  than  ANY  other
         system!  It's  been demonstrated to reliably handle over FIVE
         HUNDRED message areas!

      *  Open  architecture  script  facility;  It is now possible for
         third party vendors to supply  any  desired  type  of  script
         driver to suit any need.

      *  Passworded file request areas; Have some files you want to be
         able to request,  but you don't want anyone else to get?  Now
         you can protect them!

      *  Passworded mail pickups;  Worried about hackers stealing mail
         that you hold for pickup?  Your worries are over!

      *  Magic filenames;  You can now define special filenames  (like
         INFO   for  D:\FILES\GENERAL\MYSYSTEM.DOC)  to  simplify  and
         standardize file requests.

      *  New routing commands;  To support script drivers and password
         protection.  Also including the new DON'T command to override
         SEAdog default routing.

      *  LAN and multitasker  support;  The  SEAdog  mailer  now  uses
         record locking to prevent collisions,  and also releases time
         slices  under  DoubleDOS  or  DESQview  for  enhanced  system
         performance.  The  MAIL interface is now DESQview aware,  and
         can be windowed without conflicts or bleed-through.

      *  Extended options; A separate utility is available to give you
         more control over  screen  handling,  default  attributes  in
         alternate message areas, and more!

     SPECIAL UPGRADE OFFER FOR FIDONET SYSOPS:

     If you now have a copy of SEAdog version 4.0 which is in  use  on
     FidoNet,  we  will upgrade you to version 4.1 at NO CHARGE!  Take
     your SEAdog distribution disk (the green disk with our  label  on
     it),  write  your name and network address on the label,  mail it
     back to us with a self-addressed disk mailer (or at least a self-
     addressed sticky label),  and we will mail you a SEAdog 4.1  disk
     free  of charge.  (Upgrades from earlier versions still require a
     new manual, and hence still cost $35.)  Mail it to:

                    System Enhancement Associates, Inc.
                      21 New Street, Wayne, NJ  07470

     If you are attending the FidoNet Conference in  Alexandria,  then
     bring your disk up to our hospitality suite and we'll upgrade you
     on the spot!

     Hotline! (3)
     (c) 1987
     James Zachary


     Every now and again, a caller to the water and wastewater
     department will ask about issues of national concern.

     RING!

     Southeast Plant, this is Zack.

     "I am taking a survey for my organization.  Do you have time to
     answer a few questions?"

     Ma'am, this is a sewage plant...

     "You are a taxpayer and a voter aren't you?"

     Yes Ma'am, but ...

     "This will only take a few moments.  Do you think prophylactics
     should be on television?"

     Say what?

     "Prophylactics... condoms... they are..."

     I KNOW what they are lady.

     "Should they be on your TV?"

     What good would they do on my TV?  It never leaves the house...

     "DO YOU FAVOR ADVERTISING THEM ON TV!?"

     I could care less.

     "WELL, YOU BETTER CARE!  THERE IS AN AIDS EPIDEMIC GOING ON AND
     THE PUBLIC IS BASICALLY IGNORANT!"

     You seem to be a living testament to that...

     "Would advertising them on TV offend you?"

     After 14 years in sewage, nothing much does offends me.

     "Now, as a viewer of TV, what names would you find the least
     offensive?"

     Trojan.

     "I mean what descriptive name?  Condoms ...?  Prophylactics...?"

     Call them rubbers.  I don't much care.

     "That's a bit crude don't you think?"

     Here at work, we call them whitefish or bottlebass ...

     "What do mean 'at work'...?  You wear them at work?"

     No ma'am.  Remember that this is a sewage plant and that
     anything considered disposable usually winds up being flushed
     down the commode.  Everyday we get a few thousand of them
     buggers floating in the clarifiers and filters.  You seem like
     you are preparing to lobby for having them advertised on TV, so
     maybe you can give me a break and tell people to quit flushing
     them.

     "What harm does flushing them do?"

     Ma'am, they plug the sewer pipes and everything else.  I
     remember one of the many times that I had to pull a plugged
     pump.  You can never see what is in that mass of goo stuck in
     the pump impeller, so you just have to reach in and grab hold of
     it all.  Well, some bozo had flushed one of those  'exciter'
     types...

     "What type is that?"

     ... the kind with antlers.  I mean to tell ya, it scared the
     hell outta me when I latched onto that thing!  It was wiggling
     like it was alive!  For a moment, I thought I had an octopus by
     the ears...

     "Uhhh... you mean... there is more than one type?"

     Oh yes Ma'am!  Should be interesting to see all of the marketing
     approaches they will use on TV.  Should also be REAL educational
     for the "ignorant public" that you are so worried about.  We used
     to keep a bulletin board filled with all of the different sizes,
     models and colors...

     "You are kidding of course..."

     Oh, no Ma'am!  We fished out all of the novelty items and tacked
     them up for display.  My favorite was one that had the American
     Flag on it.

     "The Flag?  Just where did they put The Flag?"

     About half-staff...

     CLICK!

     Hmmmmm.  She must have dropped the phone while saluting...

                                  MegaList
                        A Cross-System File Listing
                            YOU can easily join!

     I was in one of my  more  creative  moods  the  other  day;  I've
     finally  written a system that I've wanted to for quite some time
     now:  MegaList.  The "MegaList" is an alphabetized  file  listing
     that combines the files from ALL PARTICIPATING Fido/Opus systems.
     If  you've ever needed a file,  but didn't know where to find it,
     the MegaList is a good place to look;  scan down the list for the
     file  you  need,  and listed next to it are the BBSs that have it
     online.

     The MegaList is available for download  or  SEAdog  file  request
     from 135/68.  The following files are online now:

          MEGALIST.ARC/TXT The National (unfiltered) MegaList
          MEGA-ARC.ARC/TXT The National ARChive MegaList
          MEGA-TXT.ARC/TXT The National TXT/DOC MegaList
          ML-UPD.ARC       MegaList Update Software

     YOUR  system  can be added to the NATIONAL MegaList if you simply
     run the update program,  ML-UPD.  This  program  will  create  an
     update  file  based  on  YOUR  system  information  and FILES.BBS
     contents.  This data is then ARCed and Net-mailed to  135/68  for
     central collection.  The NATIONAL MegaList is updated each day at
     6:15AM and posted for download or file request.

     Placing  your  system  in  the  MegaList will let the rest of the
     world know what's on your system without everyone having to  call
     and  look.  The  ML-UPD  program is easy and only takes about 1-2
     minutes to run.  All you must do is send  a  MegaList  update  to
     Miami  at least once every 45 days,  and you will be in the daily
     MegaList update.

     Chattanooga, TN (615) 892-7773

                             TRSDOS 6 EXPIRATION DATE
          Model 4 owners discovered some time ago that the way
     TRSDOS 6.2 was written, the date function would not accept any
     year beyond 1987. We said at the time that something would be
     done about it before that "expiration date."
          Logical Systems has announced an upgrade which extends
     that date to 1999. You'll also be able to obtain an upgrade
     (Ver. 6.3) from your local Radio Shack store later this month.
     The new version also includes speed enhancements and automatic
     time stamping capability. There will be a charge of $39.95 for
     the package. Ask for Cat. No. 700-2297.
          The year 1999 is not an arbitrary limitation. Due to the
     way the operating system is written, going beyond that
     numerical value will require some "non-trivial" re-
     programming, an issue which will be addressed at a later time.

          While we're on the subject of operating systems, I've
     received a couple of questions from Linda Hapner, Editor of
     "T-BUG".
          First, Linda questions the rumor that the Tandy 6000 will
     be discontinued this year. Not true, Linda. You'll see the
     6000 in our 1988 catalog which will be distributed this Fall.
          The second rumor is about a new version of Xenix for the
     6000. That one's true. It's currently in test. Any of you who
     know anything about software understand that it's risky to
     quote availability dates until the testing procedure is
     complete, but our best current estimate is late third quarter.
          From what I hear, it will be worth the wait. Xenix 3.2
     will include speed enhancements, support for console graphics
     and the 20Mb, 8-inch disk cartridge system. I don't want to
     spoil your very pleasant surprises by listing all the
     enhancements here, but a couple of others include an automatic
     re-boot in case of power failure, and the ability to do an
     automatic daily adjustment of the clock, for those who
     predictably loose (or gain) time each day.
                                        MS-DOS
          There are frequent questions about MS-DOS, since it
     operates on several of our computers which have different
     capabilities. It could be said that all versions of that
     system are not necessarily just alike.
          The Tandy 3000 family's MS-DOS 3.2 (current Ver. 3.20.02
     with BIOS Ver. 1.02), for example, includes partitioning of
     the over-32Mb hard disks. (MS-DOS supports only 32 Mb of
     storage per disk.) I understand IBM didn't do partitioning
     until their version 3.3.
          We will have a new version soon. Ver. 3.20.03 (with BIOS
     Ver. 1.03) will include some minor fixes, more hard disk
     support added to the table, and 3.5-inch 1.44Mb floppy
     support, for the 1.44Mb drives I told you last month were
     coming. MS-DOS 3.3 is scheduled around the end of this year.
     FYI - The Tandy 3000 and 3000 HL use the same OS, but BIOS
     ROMs are NOT interchangeable between the two systems.
     FidoNews 4-30                Page 10                  10 Aug 1987


          There will be a similar new version for the 1000 SX also.
     Remember that although MS-DOS supplied for the Tandy 3000 and
     3000 HL may run on the 1000, our release versions for the two
     are different.  The BASIC language supplied for the 3000 does
     not support the 1000 family's enhanced graphics and sound
     capabilities.
          In case you want to be sure your own system is up-to-
     date, the current versions of MS-DOS for the 1000 family are
     2.11.25 (BIOS 1.02) for the EX, and 3.20.00 (BIOS 1.02) for
     the SX. The original Tandy 1000 uses MS-DOS 2.11.25 or
     3.20.00, with BIOS Ver. 1.01. The Tandy 2000 current version
     is 2.11.03, and is not expected to change. MS-DOS for the
     Tandy 1200, is version 2.11.41.
                                       OS-9
          Lest I be accused of leaving out the Color Computer, the
     current version of OS-9 for the CoCo 2 is LV. I, Ver. 2.00.00,
     and for the CoCo 3 it's Lv. II, Ver. 2.00.01.  There are no
     anticipated new versions of either coming this year. CoCo 3
     owners will be happy to hear, however, that the Lv. II
     development system is expected to be available in the next 60
     days.
                                 OTHER COCO MATTERS
          I received a letter from a concerned CoCo owner recently.
     He actually wrote to a magazine, and they forwarded it to me.
          The letter said that local computer departments had
     "shuffled" the CoCo to the back of the department and appeared
     to be placing all the emphasis on MS-DOS. He feared that this
     signaled the end of his favorite personal computer.
          Our terminology "computer department" refers to the
     computer section or "Plus Computer Center" within a Radio
     Shack consumer store. If he's seeing the CoCo shuffled in
     those locations, something is wrong. Our merchandising plan
     for all consumer stores calls for the Color Computer to be
     just about the first item you find in the front of every
     store. That hasn't changed.
          In my reply, I told the writer that the CoCo is one of
     those products that refuses to die... or even slow down. The
     heaviest sales, as you might expect, occur in the Christmas
     quarter of the year. But every year, we sell more units than
     the previous year. Last October - December, according to
     InfoCorp, a Cupertino, California research firm, Tandy's share
     of the PC-compatible unit sales though retail channels was a
     staggering 41%! (The second place brand was Epson with 14%.)
     But you know what?? We still sold more Color Computers than
     MS-DOS machines.
          The end of a computer's lifespan is almost exclusively up
     to you, the consumer. When you stop buying them, it's a pretty
     clear signal that the end has come. Until then, I told our
     friend, I don't think CoCo enthusiasts have much to worry
     about.
                                    80386
          No, I'm not going to tell you about a new Tandy 80386
     machine just now. What I am going to tell you, is that Intel's
     "Inboard 386" board (for 80286 computers) has been certified
     to run on our Tandy 3000 family.  The 3000 and 3000 HL are two
     of the very few machines which have been certified.  This
     FidoNews 4-30                Page 11                  10 Aug 1987


     board will be available through Express Order.
                                     PRICES REDUCED
          Good news! Effective July 1, the prices on our 20 and
     40Mb internal hard disk kits are being substantially reduced.
     The 20Mb kit is reduced from $799 to $599, and the 40Mb drops
     from $1,799 to $1,399.
          Also on July 1, the CM-11 monitor was reduced from
     $459.95 to $399.95, and the T-1000 256K memory kit dropped
     from $99.95 to $79.95.
                                   GRAPHICS MATTERS
           We really think two features of IBM's April 2
     announcement are outstanding. We like the 3.5-inch disk format,
     and the new VGA graphics. You know we were already offering
     3.5-inch disks as an option.
          VGA graphics offer the promise of greatly improved
     graphics at reduced cost. We're already seeing third-party
     prototype boards. Will Tandy offer them?  Yes. We're currently
     sourcing monitors, and we expect to be able to offer monitors,
     and boards soon... surely by the time any software is
     available to take advantage of them.
          Will we incorporate VGA into future products? You won't
     see them in our next generation, but down the road... who
     knows. You may see VGA, or even something better, with VGA as
     a subset.
                                   FUTURE DIRECTIONS
          I still get several calls each week... "Will Tandy clone
     the PS/2 line?"  There's enough smoke in that area that it's
     difficult to identify the real issues. There are a lot of
     industry press reports confirming my earlier statements about
     the questionable immediate advantage to those systems.
          Despite all the claims of wide PS/2 acceptance, PC
     Magazine surveyed a number of large corporate customers. Based
     on their findings, PC editors told a recent industry gathering
     in Dallas, Texas, "There will be far fewer PS/2 computers sold
     than anyone in this room thinks will be sold."
          An InfoWorld reporter told me this week that they ran a
     similar survey, with almost identical results... it's a "wait
     (on OS/2) and see" attitude.
          Byte Magazine's computer laboratory has been examining
     the operating speed of the PS/2 systems and trying to
     determine what portion of the increased speed can be
     attributed to the bus, disk caching, and zero wait state. As
     of last month, they had not been able to accurately break it
     down.  Theirs isn't the first such report I've heard.
          Aside from the PS/2 features we believe are winners, we
     have no plans to clone the systems or even other system
     features, until or unless the market tells us we should. After
     all, customers who need OS/ 2's capabilities have the option
     of running it on PS/2 or existing 80286 computers, including
     the Tandy 3000 family. On May 27, at a press reception in New
     York City, we demonstrated OS/2 running on the 3000 HL.
          At the reception, Tandy Chairman John V. Roach and R&D
     Vice President Dr. John Patterson discussed Tandy's view of
     "post-April 2 compatibility". We believe the important
     compatibility is software. Hardware compatibility, beyond the
     ability to use existing expansion boards, is no longer a real
     FidoNews 4-30                Page 12                  10 Aug 1987


     issue. IBM put it to rest by adding two new system families
     (the Model 30 and the Models 50, 60, and 80) which aren't
     compatible with the existing PC/XT/AT standards.
          If you accept that premise, then the door is open to some
     real hardware innovation by a number of capable industry
     players. We intend to take advantage of the opportunity.
          Tandy development efforts are being concentrated in
     several areas. We want to offer the best value in computers.
     We believe customers should be able to configure their systems
     the way they want them, rather than specific manufacturer-
     selected configurations. And finally, we're involved heavily
     in trying to make computers easy to use... even for those
     folks who today refuse to touch one. In fact, that's a major
     objective of our in-house software team. Stay tuned...

          Now that I've become used to  WordPerfect,  I  can  actually
     start  learning more about it.  My only regret is that it doesn't
     use the mouse,  of course it does some things easier without  the
     mouse than Word does with the mouse (almost requires the mouse to
     be  more  honest).  I'm  getting  ready  to attend the FidoCon in
     August,  it's going to be nice to actually see some of the people
     whose  messages  I've  been reading (or programs I've been using)
     for over a year.  But enough on that,  last week I mentioned that
     I'd do a quick look at the WordPerfect Library (which is actually
     a very nice set of programs even if you don't have WordPerfect).

     -- The WordPerfect Library (WordPerfect Corp., $99.95) --

          As I mentioned above the WordPerfect Library is not only for
     WordPerfect users, most of the programs can be used by themselves
     or as memory resident utilities or TSRs.  Included in the library
     is an appointment calendar, a notebook/database, a calculator, an
     ascii text editor, the Wordperfect macro editor, a DOS shell, and
     game (nothing fantastic, just something cute and stupid). While I
     am by no means a fan of most of the DOS shells out there,  I  can
     see  how this one could be a lot of help to many people.  It is a
     simple menuing system and while your typical  new  user  probably
     wouldn't  be  able  to  set  it up (unless they're only using the
     library programs,  WordPerfect and PlanPerfect),  the dealer it's
     purchased  from should be able to set it up for them.  It took me
     awhile to figure out how to set up sub-menus,  but once  I  found
     the section in the manual it was simple.  The only drawback I can
     see is the lack of any password protection in the shell.

          I've found the appointment calendar  moderately  useful.  It
     contains a daily memo area, a "things to do" list, and a straight
     appointment  list.  All  of  these  are kept for each day and the
     upper left section of the  display  is  dedicated  to  a  graphic
     picture  of  a  monthly  calendar with tags for each of the three
     functions in the appointment calendar.  For the daily appointment
     you  can  set it up to give you an audible alarm (you can control
     how long it advance and how often it  repeat).  It's  capable  of
     printing  out  several  different  reports  (or at least the same
     report just looking different),  and the  date  and  time  format
     control will look very familiar if you use WordPerfect. I've been
     trying  to avoid using it,  as when I forget about an appointment
     it's usually because I WANT to forget it.  For those of  you  are
     more  conscientious  than  I  am,  you  may find this part of the
     Library to be very useful.

          The Notebook is actually  a small  database. You  can set up
     the database  to contain  any information you're often using. You
     can switch  between  two  different  views,  a  list  view  and a
     FidoNews 4-30                Page 14                  10 Aug 1987


     notecard style  view. It's  intended to  be kept in the list view
     (showing all the names and phone numbers in the sample  file) and
     when you  add or  edit a  record it switches into the full screen
     view. All you have to do in order to see the full  record is move
     a  highlight  bar  to  the  record you're interested in and press
     return. If  you  have  a  modem  attached  to  your  machine, the
     Notebook can  also dial the phone numbers for you. Someone of you
     may be saying "But SideKick already does all of this."  Well, the
     biggest difference is that using the Library and WordPerfect, all
     the keys stay the same. F7 always means quit, you  no longer have
     to  remember  different  keystrokes  that  do  the  same thing in
     different  programs.  All  your  programs  use  almost  identical
     keystrokes (not  much sense  having a graph key in an appointment
     calendar). Besides, SideKick doesn't give you a DOS Shell.

          Another feature  of  the  Notebook  is  that  it  keeps it's
     records  in  the  WordPerfect  merge  format. If you're using the
     notebook to manage a mailing list of some  sort, you  can use the
     notebook files  when you  create a  form letter with WordPerfect.
     I've already used the notebook to help me create a form letter. I
     merely wrote up the letter in WordPerfect incorporating the merge
     codes that are used  when  I  actually  have  it  print  the form
     letter, brought  up the notebook and created a one shot file with
     all the names and such in it, went back to WordPerfect and loaded
     the merge file (that was just created in the notebook) and had it
     print my finalized forms. A friend of mine  who works  at a local
     hospital, and  bought WordPerfect at the same time as I did, uses
     the notebook to maintain a list of doctors at the hospital. Every
     Monday he  has to  send out  a weekly  report of  some kind, that
     contains information on where the  physician  hasn't  been  up to
     par. Since  all of that is in the notebook, he's been able to get
     his secretary to manage  the notebook  records. Now  every Monday
     morning the  secretary merely brings up WordPerfect and loads the
     notebook file from the past week and the standardized report. She
     calls up  a macro  and the  machine proceeds to print out several
     dozen reports. In the past this  took the  secretary most  of the
     morning, going  over the notes on the doctors and manually typing
     up several dozen reports. Now she's done in a few minutes. Things
     like  this  have  made  a  big difference for many people and the
     easier it becomes, the more time they can  spend doing  real work
     instead of  going through rote procedures that just take a lot of
     man hours.

          The calculator is one of the best I've ever come  across. It
     is actually several different calculator programs built into one.
     For people like me there's a programmer's calculator;  also built
     in  is  a  financial  calculator,  a statistical calculator and a
     scientific  calculator.  You  can  switch  between   the  several
     different calculators  by hitting  a few switches. It maintains a
     "tape" of all it's work on the screen. If the  screen isn't large
     enough  you  can  have  it  generate  a  physical tape by sending
     everything to your printer.  The programmer's  calculator has all
     of my  favorite functions  and number  bases. I've  found it very
     useful while  entering code  with their  program editor. Whenever
     I'm  trying  to  determine  the  correct  values  for some of the
     numbers (I've been playing with my assembler recently), I call it
     FidoNews 4-30                Page 15                  10 Aug 1987


     up  with  a  few  keystrokes.  While  I do have a very nice Casio
     programmer's  calculator,  I've  found  the  WordPerfect  Library
     calculator to be a lot handier at times.

          The program editor is supposed to be the same editor used at
     WordPerfect. While  I take  this statement  with a  grain of salt
     (I've  known  too  many  programmers who are fanatical about text
     editors), I will concede that it is a good editor.  Once again we
     find the key strokes continuing over across the product line. I'm
     quickly becoming accustomed to  having  everything  use  the same
     function key combinations for similar tasks. The editor itself is
     almost a  very cut-down  WordPerfect. You  don't have  any of the
     fancy formatting, spell checkers or a thesaurus; but it does work
     fairly quick (it does take it a few seconds to go from one end of
     the 132  column nodelist  to the  opposite end)  and has only one
     drawback in my eyes. I haven't been able to discover  any one key
     line delete function including the carriage return/linefeed. I've
     only been able to get it to  delete  to  end  of  line  (from the
     beginning of  a line)  and then  delete the  CR/LF combination. I
     wrote a quick macro to help  get around  this and  everything has
     been fine  since, but  I would have preferred it to be built into
     the editor. The program editor has the same  sophisticated macros
     that WordPerfect does, and the Macro Editor is capable of editing
     the macros from the  program editor  just as  easily as  it works
     with  the  WordPerfect  macros.  While  it  doesn't do windows as
     easily as I've heard Brief does,  it does  allow me  to work with
     two files at the same time and I've found that to be sufficient.

          The macro  editor is  the reason most WordPerfect user's buy
     the Library. While I  have to  agree that  it should  be packaged
     with WordPerfect  instead of a separate product, I've got both so
     I'm not complaining.  If  you're  using  WordPerfect  macros, you
     should definitely  get the  Library for  the macro editor. When I
     first created the macro I use for the end of this column,  I went
     crazy trying  to get  everything as close to perfect on the first
     try. I eventually ended up with several macros linked together to
     correct the  mistakes. After  I looked at the library, I was able
     to correct the original macro (and get rid of the patched macros)
     in minutes. Instead of having to re-key the entire macro, or link
     several macros together as I did,  you can  go in  and correct or
     expand on  your original  macro. If you're using WordPerfect in a
     business environment, it would make  it  unnecessary  to  re-do a
     complicated macro whenever something in it changed.

          Some of  you reading  this won't  understand how useful this
     can be, but bear with me for another moment. Imagine  if you were
     able  to  go  through  your  usual log-on procedure on a bulletin
     board merely by typing in everything once with your communications
     package. Every  time after that you would merely press an Alt key
     and a letter and your communications  program would automatically
     check for any new uploaded files or mail in the several different
     areas. This is one  of the  things a  macro can  do for  you. But
     wait, the  sysop has added a new menu into the early parts of the
     board. Your macro doesn't work any  more.  If  you  don't  have a
     means of  editing the macro, you'll have to go through the entire
     log-on procedure being careful not to make any  mistakes (or else
     FidoNews 4-30                Page 16                  10 Aug 1987


     every time you use it, it will go through and re-do your mistake).
     The ability to edit the existing macro will make your  life a lot
     easier as  you don't  have to  go through  any long procedures to
     adjust or  change something.  While this  is a  little bit better
     explanation of a macro than I gave last week, it's still a little
     weak. I've heard of people having macros that do everything short
     of wash  the windows  when doing certain types of form letters. A
     change in the data format doesn't  spell the  end of  a macro, it
     can still be modified to work under the new system.

          While I'd  be the  first to agree that the Library isn't for
     everyone, it can fill several niches  not really  supported under
     Sidekick or  most of  the other TSRs. Under the DOS shell you can
     make all of WordPerfect  Corp's programs  memory resident,  and I
     may start  using the  shell to  keep the  program editor resident
     while  working  on  some  programs  (I  prefer  it  to SideKick's
     editor). All  I should  have to do is save the program every time
     before I recompile it (keeping the editor loaded  with the code),
     some of my programs are beginning to take a significant amount of
     time to load and this should save me some time. Since I  can also
     keep  the   calculator  resident   (and  using  the  programmer's
     functions), it should turn  out to  be very  useful when combined
     with a few macros to make things even easier. If you're currently
     using SideKick and are  happy  with  it,  don't  worry  about the
     WordPerfect Library. If you don't have SideKick or are having too
     many problems with it, take a look at the WordPerfect  Library as
     it may  be what  you've been  trying to find. If you're currently
     using WordPerfect, run out and get it as soon as  possible (and I
     mean run, not walk).

     -- Winding Down... --

          For many  of you,  DeskTop Publishing  is only a phrase. You
     may not have any substantial thoughts on what it means  or how it
     works. All  you know  is that it's quickly becoming the catchword
     of 1987. Even if you do know  a  little  about  it,  "The  Art of
     Desktop Publishing"  by Tony  Bove, Cheryl  Rhodes and Wes Thomas
     (Bantam Computer Books, $19.95)  can  help  explain  a  lot about
     what's currently  available. The  Art of  DP explains many of the
     basic concepts of DeskTop Publishing  and  how  you  can  use the
     technology.  If  you  haven't  started  looking into the products
     available it goes  into  an  explanation  of  the  advantages and
     disadvantages  of   many  of  the  different  products  currently
     available. My only  complaint  is  that  I  find  it  to oriented
     towards the  Macintosh, and  not enough  attention is paid to the
     IBM PCs and compatibles.  This  is  understandable  because until
     recently  there  wasn't  much  in the way of professional quality
     DeskTop Publishing programs and  tools.  For  those  of  you more
     experienced  in  DeskTop  Publishing, there are sections covering
     layout and design of  various types  of publications.  Unless you
     know almost everything there is to know about DeskTop Publishing,
     you should find a few useful items in this book and for  the less
     experienced it provides a good introduction.

          As  always,  I'd  enjoy  hearing from you. Down below you'll
     find my US Mail, FidoNet and uucp address.  Those of  you sending

     About six months ago, I said self,  when will someone sell a '386
     "clone"  base system unit for $1600?  Well,  this has nearly been
     realized  if  you  are  listed  in  the  nodelist!   If  you  are
     interested,  call  the number below and discuss it.  Feel free to
     negotiate more than the base unit, but use this page as the order
     form (note any additional components agreed to  here).  You  must
     send  this  "order form" in,  and the offer is limited to one per
     SysOp.  I will verify the  order  by  netmail  to  preserve  your
     rights.  Purchases will be shipped direct from the dealer to you.
     I am just the sponsor!
