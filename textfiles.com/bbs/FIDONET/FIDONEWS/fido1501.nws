                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================

     The ZEC Election process is underway in Zone 1 and there are several
     articles in this Issue pertaining to that effort.

     The Article Specifications [ARTSPEC] for FidoNews were updated for
     1998 and hatched out last week. If you didn't get a copy via your
     regular FidoNews file distribution, check upstream to see where it
     went. You can always file-request it [ARTSPEC] from this system or
     download it from any of the sources listed in the Masthead at the end
     of every edition. The only change was the downsizing of the number of
     FidoNet Nodes from over 30,000 to over 20,000.

     If you got a new Internet-capable computer this past holiday season,
     don't forget all the Internettable FidoNet stuff and places to visit
     which are listed in the Masthead. [grin]

     On with 1998!

     C.B.

     Comments on the 1452 Snooze Editorial
     by Gordon Malone 1:261/1195, g.malone@ix.netcom.com

     Season Greets Chris!

     I just wanted to take a few minutes to comment on your editorial from
     the 1452 edition of the snooze;

     "Where are we a year later?"

     If no one wants to get the required vote together, I'll be the
     International Coordinator... :) There NEEDS to be a leader. We've been
     going nowhere fast for far too long.

     The Nodelist... You've got to be kidding. Why not? There are tens
     of folks who could do that job right here in Net261. We need to get
     rid of the "dead wood", don't we.

     Why hang on??? All of the above offerings listed in your commentary
     and then some. ;)

     Continued credit and KUDO's go deservedly out to Mr. Barchuk for
     attempting to re-invent Fido into what "it could be" if we all gave
     half a hoot and put our though, inventiveness and heart where our
     mouths are.

     Balance... Naaa. Too many folks complain and not enough folks give
     enough of a damn to do anything. Sad, ain't it. Imagine what we
     could be if everyone who joined, contributed and participated...
     Really sad.

     If folks aren't going to participate, why get involved? If you're
     not part of the solution...

     Cheers!

     Gordo

     Chris,

     I have made available every single issue of Fidonews, since the
     beginning issue, as well as yearly archives, all via FTP.  They are
     FIDONEWS 15-01               Page 3                    5 Jan 1998


     organized as follows:

     FIDO1.ZIP   (All of the issues for Volume 1)  Replace the number with
     the number or letter of the volume as it appears in the FNEWSxxx.ZIP
     format.  Current would be FIDOE.ZIP

     Each issue is also available, so if someone only needs a specific
     issue, they can get that issue as well.  There is an index file called
     00_index.txt that is a complete list of all issues by name, volume and
     issue, and date of issue.

     All of this is available via anonymous ftp at   ftp.irvbbs.com

     The name of the directory is  fidonews  (can't figure out why I
     thought of using that name - grin )

     If you would like to add a link to the Fidonews web page, feel free to
     do so.

     Subject: Mailed From FidoNews Homepage

       As I read the FidoNews articles, I am constantly reminded of the
     fact by other submitted articles that Fidonet is a dying breed due to
     the inception of the Internet.
       There have been kudos granted out to systems such as ours that offer
     Fidonet Backbone and Filebone feeds to the rest of the world using
     usually FTP server access and sometimes e-mail file attaches, although
     the latter would not be efficient due to the size of mail packets
     and/or files that are passed down the links.
        What had occurred was a sort of hybrid mating of Fidonet to the
     Internet, however, this form of mail transport still required some
     main system that operated servers, and then would have to configure
     various "secure" ftp sessions to allow the attainment of mail and
     files.
         Although efficient, this still seemed to be much work for the
     individuals who offered this service.  What was required was a more
     efficient method of transport and a better "marriage" of Fidonet to
     the Internet.
        One specific individual/company (Max Masyutin/Ritlabs)
     http://www.ritlabs.com/argus/ , has produced a piece of software that
     seems to have made the mark!  The program is a front end mailer called
     ARGUS which has built in TCP/IP support!  Although at this moment in
     time, it is only available in Win95 and NT flavors!  (Please no
     tossing of cookies).
        Zone 2, and more specifically Russia, has jumped the gun in
     implementing new flags to facilitate this new form of technology.  The
     flags in question are and have been listed in previous editions of the
     FIDONEWS 15-01               Page 4                    5 Jan 1998


     Fidonews; RAW,IFC,BND,TEL,VMP and a few other variants, but more
     importantly, "BND" being as the focal point for this new wave of
     technology.  On the outset, ARGUS is just another Binkley type mailer,
     but within it's inner workings lies some new form of technology.
     Specifically, the ability to use a TCP/IP connection and allow the
     "Re-mapping" of a normal Fidonet Node Number to an Internet IP
     address.
         So rather than say dialling up a Long Distance node via standard
     phone lines, the mailer in effect calls up the TCP/IP address and in
     normal fashion, transfers all mail packets and files to the remote
     node, only via the Internet, thereby saving the cost of Long Distance
     charges...
         This has definitely made our lives here much easier, as we are now
     connected up to the UK, and Russia, and a few nodes across ZONE 1 and
     a pending node in Indonesia, and we are transferring mail and files
     with ease using this mailer.  No need to setup the secured ftp site,
     and all that must go with this task,  just the usual setup under the
     mail tosser and the mailer itself...and the seemingly greatest benefit
     of all this technology, is that our TCP/IP lines are "NEVER BUSY"!  We
     may be holding files and a node may connect up via TCP/IP, but that
     does not tie up our phones lines, so a busy signal is never reached,
     another IP node can connect up just as easily and receive their mail
     and so on.  In fact, other than bandwidth, the TCP/IP connections are
     almost limitless!

         This is not an advertisement for this company that produces this
     mailer, as another company is on the forefront of using this as well,
     (BEEMAIL), however, this is more of an informative session to all
     those FIDOnet nodes out there that are not aware that this technology
     exists right now, and further more, for those *Cs that render the
     decisions, and perhaps enlighten them on this technology, so that they
     may as well "Push for FLAG CHANGES".

         Yes, we offer Fidonet mail and files over the internet, and yes,
     we offer it via FTP as well, however, with this new mailer, it has
     made life that less complicated for sending and receiving of mail long
     distances without costing anyone a single dime in long distance
     charges, and to be able to offer the mail to those nodes that may not
     be able to currently poll long distance, yet still have an internet
     connection.

     Yours Truly,

     Hi Christopher,

     I just received the latest newsletter and read it. There are two
     things, I like to say.

     The easier: In the FidoSoft part, there are stated two old versions.
     BGFax version is 1.70 since a few month. And RAR is 2.02.

     Now the second one. I saw Ward's statistics on the Fidonet and was
     frightened.  Zone 1 is growing down with a 21% step in only 6 month.
     Where does Fido in Zone 1 go? I know, that there are a lot of people
     are going to use more the Internet, but I have the feeling, that this
     isn't the right way. This will loose the privacy and personality,
     which we have in Fidonet. So I hope people will find back to Fido.


     regards,

     The Z1EC Election (a candidate questionnaire)
     by Lisa Gronke, 1:105/16
     lisa@psg.com

     I was asked to moderate the Z1_ELECTION echo during the Z1EC election,
     because the regular moderator, Martin Belcke, was serving as Election
     Coordinator. My candidate questionnaire (below) is adapted from one
     used in the 1991 Z1EC election. The Z1EC "job description" that it
     refers to was published in FIDO1449.NWS. I will be forwarding the
     candidate replies to FidoNews as they are received.

     Two other Z1_ELECTION participants have also addressed lists of
     questions to the candidates, David Hallford [1:10/2] & Dale Simmons
     [1:202/1100], and a number of good single questions have been posed.
     Participate in the Z1_ELECTION yourself, or ask your NEC to keep your
     Net informed.

     -> 1> What are your qualifications? What FTN positions have you held?

        Currently in Fido:  HC & N320EC
           "    OtherNets:  ZC & ZEC for USnetMail(Zone 587) {Nodes: 60}
                            ZEC for ScifiNet(Zone 102)  {Nodes: 56} Several
                            Moderator/Host positions


     -> 2> If elected Z1EC, would you continue with other currently held ->
     FTN positions?

        I would maintain my HC status but would request an election for
     N320EC commence to find a successor.
        My OtherNet positions require little time and would not interfere
     with my ZEC functions.


     -> 3> Do you foresee any problems with the list of duties for the ZEC
     -> position? Which of those functions do you consider most important?

        I find no problem with the approved list of ZEC duties. I cannot
     state that any one function is most important.  Importance of a
     function is determined at that point in time.  Mediation may be very
     important at one time but not at others.  The EchoPol initiative is
     very important IF done correctly & written properly.


     -> 4> How do you feel about Echomail Policy?

        My participation in FIDOECHOPOL since its addition to NAB should
     speak for itself.  For those that do not know me, I believe in
     EchoPol, but with restrictions.  EchoPol cannot set standards for
     Moderators nor impose "membership" requirements on them.  Both of
     these ideas were discussed in FIDOECHOPOL.  EchoPol must be written to
     create "standards" without utilizing "police" power tactics for
     "enforcement".  I know these are general statements but I truly
     believe that an EchoPol could be a positive document that in fact
     could prevent past echomail abuses and power plays. For example,
     EchoPol could establish that *EC must be elected and establish the
     Length of Service. This would have a positive effect.


     -> 5> Are there any functions not listed in the job description that
     -> you think are important?

        The listed functions are wide sweeping and until a properly
     ratified EchoPol is established I believe they are sufficient.


     -> 6> Do you anticipate any problems working with the Z1C, the RECs,
     -> the EchoList Coordinator, or those who run the major and minor
     -> distribution systems?

     FIDONEWS 15-01               Page 12                   5 Jan 1998


        Hopefully not, at present I have no individuals in the *C, *EC, or
     moderator positions that would in any way have a negative disposition
     towards me.


     -> 7> What do you think the major echomail problems in the next two ->
     years will be?

        1)  NAB, a decision must be made to determine its status in
     relation to Zone 1 FidoNet.
        2)  Internet:  An on-going effect to utilize its technology to
     further FidoNet.  Should be addressed in the Technology section of
     EchoPol.
        3)  Moderators, are they "god" of their echo or not? Could be
     addressed in EchoPol.


     -> 8> With a two year term, Jan 1, 2000 comes on your watch. What
     -> role do you see for the Z1EC at that time?

        Hopefully we will still have echomail distribution.  :-)  We need
     to really address mailer/tosser and even BBS software ability to
     handle echomail at the turn of the millennium.


     -> 9> Any other comments?

        We need to attempt to make FidoNet more friendly and supportive if
     we are to have any chance of halting the shrinking membership. Yes,
     this is a hobby, and its suppose to be fun. :-)  At the same time we
     need to support/assist each other, that is something that the Inet
     lacks. Inet is all too often cold & impersonal and filled with an
     excessive amount of "junk" in its UseNet conferences.
        I live by a very simple philosophy when I joined FidoNet and any
     OtherNet,  "I assist my uplink & support my downlink." Period.

        Thank you for taking the time to read this and I would be greatly
     honored to serve you as Z1EC.

     In a message to candidates on Dec-31-97 at 10:26:58  Lisa Gronke
     asked:

     1> a.) What are your qualifications?
        b.) What FTN positions have you held?

     Answer 1b:

     I have not held an FTN position - that actually may be in my favor,
     as I get to make all brand new enemies! Chuckle... I am NC of Net
     117.

     Answer 1a:

     As to my qualifications, you'll either read this long post if you
     really want to know, or else - you'll toggle on! :)


     Greetings from Central Texas and Mikey!

     I'm a Fido SysOp of more than ten years. Node 1:117/3000 was first
     assigned to me by Paul Sittler when Net 117 in College Station was
     bigger, for a short time, than Net 106 in Houston! I still have a
     printed doc copy and original disk of Tom Jennings' Fido BBS program,
     though it was replaced soon with the original OPUS program. Both my
     Heathkit H89, serial #699, and the early Z100 that ran 1:117/3000 are
     still here, with software on which they were retired! They still run.
     Ruth Grove ex-NC117, still has my borrowed FidoNet 117 YooHoo 2/U2
     tee shirt, so OPIE isn't lonely, I guess. :)

     Fido, for me, has always been trying to learn things Fido offers and
     putting together unique ways to use them. I'm a management,
     programming, hardware and communications system person. Paid my own
     way twice through Texas A&M University, along with a Wife and four
     Kids, plus almost a full degree for her at the same time. That came
     from telecommunications engineering. My Novice license in ham radio
     in 1952 became an Extra Class in 1953 at age 14. I work mostly HF CW,
     some 2 Meters and am competition oriented. As W5WQN, I've placed
     repeatedly in the top ten single-band entries in the USA in the ARRL
     CW DX contest, the ARRL Sweepstakes and the CQ WW. I frequently do
     not send in scores because year after year the ranks don't change
     much. Passing around a coveted piece of paper is more important to me
     than having them over and over again..

      That should tell you something about what you can expect of me here.

     I have an English degree and an MBA in corporate planning from Texas
     A&M University and a graduate minor in Sociology, earned where my
     Dad, may he rest in peace, was head of the Math Department and made a
     heck of a lot of enemies of folks whom didn't want to learn the math.
     Incidentally, Mikey is still known at the math department for being
     the kid that said, "But I don't want to do it that way!"

      That should tell you something else about what you can expect of me
     here.

     Ham radio became a Commercial First Phone and a quite rare Commercial
     First Telegraph licenses in sea service for the Oceanography
     Department at Texas A&M - while still going to school in chunks. On
     the way through I got to help build the first weather radar sets ever
     built, then worked on the first color weather radar sets ever built,
     and also the forerunner for what is now the Ryan Stormscope for
     aviation and your nightly lightning strike display on TV. I got to
     build much of the hardware for some of the first computer modeling of
     the atmosphere ever done. At sea, I engineered the first long
     distance oceanographic seismic runs on single sideband data circuits
     ever shot and some of the first remote sensing RF-linked
     oceanographic telemetry work ever done. Finally, during the MBA work,
     I got to do instrumentation and electronics for the Mach 40 plasma
     lab wind tunnel at Texas A&M where some of the Mariner Mars probe re-
     entry atmospheric research was done! No, I didn't make it into
     computer science back then, but I did get a license to learn out of
     all this.

      That should tell you something else about what you can expect of me
     here.

     What expanded into my Narte Senior Telecommunications Engineering
     ticket in six professional specialties, launched me into the
     business of aviation radio and - flying! That turned into the Chief
     Pilot's position at the ROTC flight training school at Texas A&M
     during the Viet Nam war. It opened the door to an executive position
     with two manufacturing firms that were highly aviation oriented. I
     have a substantial number of hours in light twins, much in *VERY*
     heavy solid IFR weather operations - flown by hand. When you have to
     balance running the money around the sky, covering the payroll,
     keeping up with up to 200 people in the plant as a CEO and answering
     the bank call every day; as a pilot, you learn to look into things
     and problems from the TOP DOWN, while realizing that the MAJORITY can
     whip up on you if you make too many errors. You HAVE to do a good job
     with what the majority wishes done or your airplane
     doesn't come home one dark and stormy night.

      That should tell you something else about what you can expect of me
     here.

     I've earned every one of my 58 year old gray hairs still left on my
     head.

      That should tell you something else about what you can expect of me
     here.

     If you think airline food is bad, try franchise food for lunch every
     day of the week hand-flying a Beech Baron back from squirreling money

     Our product in one operation is in every State in the United States,
     every province of Canada, Alaska, Mexico and now, to my knowledge 28
     countries on five continents. Twice I've built a National marketing
     operation. All the while, we were this Nation's test case for
     Manufacturer's Excise Tax for our product, over a claimed $6,000,000
     FIDONEWS 15-01               Page 15                   5 Jan 1998


     in, "Taxes due." They were not; they never were. Everything that
     happened to us for 18 years it took to break that claim - properly -
     *TWICE* - in Federal court, was done improperly by the "Claimant."
     There is a right way and a wrong way about going about taking care of
     problems. You never win, but, you do. The complete law on Excise tax
     over the issue was re-written to cover what was unjust about the go
     around. We will never be #1, but..

      That should tell you something else about what you can expect of me
     here.

     For years, I've operated a FidoNet Private Node that has, in the
     opinion of almost all those that have dealt with the issue, been
     supportive of both Fido system-wide and VERY much, our local Net 117.
     It offers some unique public service emergency gateway access between
     land-line and direct air access. That has gained Fido some very
     important notice by ARRL and others as a method that could be used
     for emergency traffic handling for thousands of needed public service
     messages in time of a real emergency.  Few FidoNet people, I think,
     really understand how closely the ham radio crew and the FidoNet crew
     are to each other. Over the years, the interface is more than just a
     coincidence. As a programmer and systems-level wanna-bee (aren't we
     all?), I rightly or wrongly chose Opie as an actual embedded portion
     of some of the code. That's why he is still around, but his time is
     coming. You will note that 1:117/3001 is a public node and will soon
     host Net 117 - it's being moved to BINK/MAX, FAM/2, OS/2's server
     setup and more, as I learn how.

     There is always something new and different, some better way to
     operate a system, if you really want to learn about it. All it takes
     is being willing to take the risk to gain a reward which justifies
     the risk. All it takes is the desire to stand up for the right
     technical and social answers for the good of the group and not be
     beholdin to any one segment. Shakespeare said it well, "Neither
     borrower nor lender be, for borrowing oft dulls the edge of
     husbandry." I am not a puppet of ANYONE in Fido, nor do I have the
     slightest wish to be a puppet master.  I only wish to server, pun
     intended.

      That should tell you something else about what you can expect of me
     here. I think that the chance to look at the Z1EC slot and upper
     management section of Fido is worth the risk to run.

        1.) I think there is a future for Fido if we act quickly to focus
            our strengths more vertically as a group, targeting our
            "marketing", so to speak, on the sysop here mostly because he
            or she wants to be a mini-IP, if you will.

        2.) I think local interest by even just a few dedicated users that
            interact with a local sysop, much like gossiping over the
            backyard fence, will keep Fido here in even heavily trafficked
            Internet areas.

        3.) I think that there is PLENTY of room for Fido in less developed
            parts of the world and though I've never been to very many of
            them, I have been to some. I do understand the technical

            areas.

        4.) Although P4 does regulate Fido, I have *NO* problem in working
            with it even as it stands, in bringing forward the final echo
            organization that must be done for what was never finished with
            P4. The job can be accomplished - if it is organized well.

        5.) I think there is room for both the control from assignment and
            elected influence.

     I'm neither pro-P5 nor anti-P4 in all of this. I am, hopefully, a
     good choice for an ADMINISTRATOR and really, simply a COORDINATOR for
     what should happen in the echo medium we have here. Heck, the chair
     doesn't even vote on a committee, unless actually needed, folks! I
     couldn't care less about any power trip here - just believe that I
     can make a difference in Fido and can help move it forward into the
     future.

     I ask your support to let me try to simply chair this group that
     really is the technical nuts and bolts of Fido, nothing more.


     2> If elected Z1EC, would you continue with other currently held FTN
     positions?

     Answer 2:

        P4 says:

        "Coordinators are encouraged to limit the number of FidoNet
         functions they perform.  A coordinator who holds two different
         positions compromises the appeal process.  For example, if the
         Network Coordinator is also the Regional Coordinator, sysops in
         that network are denied one level of appeal."


     3> a.) Do you foresee any problems with the list of duties for the
            ZEC position?

        I've added the (1) as in Z1EC in a few places where I think it
        was left out, but maybe that's an error! :)

      AT THE PLEASURE OF THE Z1C, THE DUTIES OF THE Z1EC SHALL BE:

        1) Coordination between the Z1 distribution systems

             Answer - > (See job description for Mule later on.) :)

                        I'm old enough to recall the old
                        "20 Mule Team Borax" boxes...
                        I will be one of the mules...  :)

        2) Coordination of the RECC and with the Z1 RECs.

           The Z(1)EC shall be the chairperson of the RECC. He shall
     FIDONEWS 15-01               Page 17                   5 Jan 1998


           put forth ideas to and/or moderate the discussion of
           ideas brought before the RECC.

             Answer - > That's the general format in most committees,
                        I've never had a problem with that.

           He shall also act as a tie breaker in the event of a tie
           vote.  The RECC may overturn a Z(1)EC proposed action/idea
           with a 2/3rds majority of the RECC.

             Answer - > That's the general format in most committees,
                        I've never had a problem with that. More
                        specifically, it is my rule as Chair on all
                        committees on which I've served, that the
                        Chair does *NOT* vote, unless to break a tie.
                        The Chair is, technically, assumed to be <FOR>
                        the matter at hand, but not - of record.

           If the RECC concludes that the Z(1)EC is not active,
           ineffective in his/her job or is just not taking care
           his/her responsibilities; they may take a vote of
           no-confidence. If the vote of no-confidence passes with
           a 2/3rds majority, the RECC will refer this issue to
           the ZC for mediation or action as the Z1C sees fit

             Answer - > That's the general format in most committees,
                        I've never had a problem with that.

           On the same basis, the Z(1)EC shall be allowed to take issue
           with RECs that are not participating and/or doing their
           job; by taking the matter up with both the host RC
           of the RECs hosting region and the Z1C for mediation or
           action as the Z1C sees fit. These two actions shall NOT
           be taken lightly without all due consideration of possible
           extenuating circumstances.

             Answer - > That's the general format in most committees,
                        I've never had a problem with that.

        3) Coordination with the other ZECs.

             Answer - > I foresee that problems will exist in the future
                        in that the "culture" of FidoNet is changing
                        markedly.  Technology is molding FidoNet into
                        a far different dog than it was.  You have to
                        understand language is culture and the reverse
                        is also true! It wasn't just that FidoNet was
                        'English', the culture of it was also 'English',
                        at first.  The 'English' way of doing things
                        also suited it's growth needs quite well.

                        FidoNet once 'needed' that just to be able to
                        grow.  Now, there are many places in the world
                        where the 'English' way of doing things is
                        losing leverage because technology is empowering
                        even an average participant in ways that make
     FIDONEWS 15-01               Page 18                   5 Jan 1998


                        it possible to emplace other cultures quite
                        readily - if you please.  That may not be good.

                        Sidebar - The ICAO standard 'culture' is English.
                        Noticed what I think is a significant rise in
                        major international airline accidents, lately?
                        Think about this whole language - culture deal
                        a minute or two and that ....

                        We will see similar 'accidents' come full force in
                        the next two years here, in Fido, in my opinion.

                        Curiously - I also feel that the organization,
                        to survive - still has to have a 'standard'
                        culture, if that's what we mean here!

                        Thus - brought full face-forward by the issues
                        involving echomail - our major job is to actually
                        re-define our 'Fido Culture' as something quite
                        different than we currently see..

                             Be careful. That can be taken more than
                             one way... :)

                             You have to watch Mikey's use of words.

                             I make a coordinated effort at all things. :)

                        It is my opinion that is one reason Z1C embarked
                        on letting this process loose...

                        Z2 is watching this one closely, I opine.

                        I think I can speak culture well enough
                        to help Fido survive.

        4) Central repository of information for the various Z1
           distribution systems.

             Answer - > The Z1EC serves at the pleasure of the Z1C.
                        However, please note that back in the '20's
                        in the US'nA, the price of steel magically
                        rose and rose and rose despite 'guvmint
                        screaming - Later we found out Andrew
                        Carnegie was pulling on his left ear lobe too
                        often.   That old encrypted mail issue.,, :)

                        In order to survive it appears we might need
                        a large 2 X 4... Z1C will have to issue it
                        to minimize inter-distribution system fighting.

        5) Mediation of Zone 1 echomail issues.

             Answer - > Mediation means exactly what it says;
                        it is often confused with the word
                        arbitration.  Note the difference.
     FIDONEWS 15-01               Page 19                   5 Jan 1998


                        You may ask those here that know me
                        if I know that difference.  I think
                        they will say I do; even though I
                        didn't ask to marry them at all! :)

                        In a volunteer organization the equal
                        and opposite force to, "You will" is;
                        "I quit."

                        "Patience is a virtue."

                        "The constant dripping of water wears
                         away stone."

                        I will do everything I can to avoid
                        arbitration. I prefer that people
                        learn to exist together rather than
                        have to be told to leave.

        6) Upper level mediation between Moderators, Fidonet
           distribution systems on related echomail issues.

             Answer - > I foresee that problems will exist in the
                        future here because cost-push mail offering
                        will suffer a MUCH heavier assault from
                        demand-pull enabled lower-level sysops, whom
                        will have terribly more effective systems,
                        for peanuts in price, in the near future.

                        Burnham Woods will march on Dunkirk Castle
                        in the reign of this Z1EC, if my guess in
                        correct.

                        'Get this off my proposed back' - Z1C...
                         Yes Sir, I'll do my best, Sir. :)

        7) Coordination with the Echolist Keeper.

             Answer - > If 30,000 'nodes' can be listed weekly and
                        distributed weekly, so can a 'culturally'
                        correct Echolist. It can be done one
                        way or another.

                        The same type tools that enable Internet
                        usegroup selection techniques will not
                        only surface here in the next two years,
                        they will force a 'standardized' Echolist.

                        The list will force its keeper into the open.

        8) Help in the formation and implementation (in conjunction
           with the RECC) of a Zone/Fido-wide Echomail policy. The
           Z(1)EC shall keep the RECC informed of these discussions so
           that the RECs may pass this information down to their
           regional sysops.

             Answer - > I foresee this to be one of the most important
                        things we have to do.

                        Help in.. means.. the Chair is charged with
                        the responsibility for the organization of
                        and laying out of the work format.

                        Comment - The only way I have EVER seen any
                        committee EVER get anything done was to lay
                        out the agenda and work it through/

                        When the list is done - it's reported out to
                        the boss, Ichi Ban, El Jeffe, El Patrone, Il
                        Padrone (Z1C + the SysOps of this Zone) and
                        what's done with it after that will be up
                        to the decision of the Zone.

        9) Term(s) of no more than 2 years.  No limit on number of terms

             Answer - > Survival is doubtful.  Crosses himself, looking
                        for wallet.

       10) Codify, with the RECC, the procedure for future ZEC elections.
           All future elections are subject to review by the Z1C..

             Answer - > If you don't understand P4, go back and read it
                        again.  This is *NOT* a democracy.  The only
                        purpose for any election in FidoNet, that I
                        know about, is either defined specifically in
                        P4 already, or is for the allowed purpose of
                        feeding input to Empire Central.

                        "You will." - "I quit." - "So what do we do now?"

                        "Find another bank."  Mikey, to a VP of the
                         First City Bank, Houston, 1976.. having read
                         the remark elsewhere before and since.

                         Any suggestions that I might have for the
                         future elections should be tempered by
                         the experiences in this one. I have
                         confidence we will learn from our experiences
                         in this election. If it needs to be changed,
                         I suspect it will be evident. If it works
                         well, I suspect that will be evident too.

       11) Provide for an interim Z1EC, should anything happen to
           currently seated Z1EC to prevent him/her from fulfilling
           these duties. The single duty of the interim Z1EC shall be
           to expedient an election and a smooth transition to the
           next Z1EC (should it become necessary). If there are
           problems the interim ZEC shall contact the Z1C for help if
           the problem cannot be resolved within the RECC.

                        Specifically, in a similar manner to the
                        fact that there is no ANC, but we've had
                        'one' formally in Net 117, I'll, if
                        elected, at the outset, determine whom
                        was the next ranking candidate in this
                        election...

                            I'll ask for help.

                        You never know how much you needed it until you
     ask.

                        The deal you do not investigate is always the deal
                        you lose.

        b.) Which of those functions do you consider most important?

             Answer - > Discussing the issue with the Boss, if
                        it hasn't been left to me to do. :)

                        When a 30 year client of mine bought his first
                        radio station with private financing arranged
                        for by the late John Hicks, a short while later
                        he called him up and asked, "What should I do?"

                        John replied, "That's what you got the money for.
                        It's YOUR problem." :)


     4> How do you feel about Echomail Policy?

            Answer - > 'Sunfinshed Business.  Finish what you started,
                       before asking for more problems.  We need to
                       finish the Policy.


     5> Are there any functions not listed in the job description that
        you think are important?

             Answer - > Privately..  We are electing a whining rod, which
                        is OK by me... :)

                        I can tell this one.. OK?     chuckle..

                        There is a good Jewish joke.  Rabbi Cohen was
                        killed with Father Flannigan, jointly.  Heaven
                        bound, it got too hard for Father Flannigan to
                        climb.  Cohen invited him to be carried the rest
                        of the way.  Peter looked out at the party
                        approaching the gates.  He called out, "Father

                        the slavery of modem connects to their
                        'provider', whether it be an IP or a BBS,
                        a la FidoNet.

                        There are tools coming on line FAST that will
                        GREATLY expand the role of client-server
                        right down into our beloved Fido's dog dish.

                        They will be cheap.  They will be effective.
                        They will literally tear apart the entire door-
                        concept BBS that we know of today.
                        Empires will crumble and new ones will arise.

                        The problems we face in dealing with echomail
                        today will be far different and serious when
                        these tools come on line and Fido assimilates
                        them, if that happens, which I think it will.

                        a manager in this Z1EC position who can work
                        with technical people.  I believe that I can

     Lisa, please don't do anything to discourage questions from the other
     members of FIDO. Perhaps your title should read "Lisa Gronke's Z1EC
     candidate questions from previous elections" or something to signify
     that the questions are recycled and that they are being asked by you

     as a node and not you as the election echo moderator implying that
     other questions will be out of order.

     Thank you for compiling these questions from previous elections and
     adjusting them to our circumstances. It should help to compare
     candidates with what has happened in the past.

      LG 1> What are your qualifications? What FTN positions have you
      LG 1> held?

     I have been a member of FIDO for almost a decade. In that time I have
     almost always been a HUB of some sort. I am currently an RHUB in
     region 13, as well as NC and NEC of net2624 along with being a feed
     source for the net. I have always looked at the costs of moving our
     mail and looked for ways to increase reliability while decreasing
     costs. I hope to do the same on a zone wide basis. I was briefly
     interim R13EC a couple of years ago.

      LG 2> If elected Z1EC, would you continue with other currently held
      LG 3> FTN positions?

     If someone locally was willing to pickup one or both of the local
     positions I would pass them on. As the local NC/NEC positions have
     only taken a few minutes per month I would otherwise keep them as I
     see no particular conflict. I would consider passing the RHub on to
     someone else but again the load is not that big. As a ZEC I would not
     be expecting to be a ZHub or other major mail mover for the zone, but
     instead an interface between the various feed systems and the
     regions/networks.

      LG 3> Do you foresee any problems with the list of duties for the ZEC
      LG 3> position?
      LG 3> Which of those functions do you consider most important?

     First off, the "list of duties" you are referring to was hashed out
     by one of the candidates with some feedback from participants in this
     echo among others. As ZEC, I would be working for the ZC. Period. I
     also feel it is best to allow the ZEC to define what their job is in
     relation to what the ZC expects from them.

     Did you know there have been over 500 messages with ZEC and DUT in
     the subject in this echo alone? A quick scan finds several revisions,
     not one that is listed as a final revision. I will paste the last
     version here so we can be sure we are on the same sheet of music.

     Feel free to crosspost at will:

     At the pleasure of the Z1C, the duties for the Z1EC shall be:

     1) Coordination between the Z1 echomail distribution systems

     2) Coordination of the RECC and with the Zone 1 RECs.

     The ZEC is the chairperson of the RECC.  He or she shall bring ideas
     to the RECC and moderate the discussion of ideas. He or she shall also
     act as a tie breaker in the event of a tie vote. The RECC may overturn
     a ZEC proposed action or idea with a 2/3rds vote of the RECC.

     If the RECC concludes that the ZEC is not active, ineffective in his
     or her job or not taking care his or her responsibilities per this
     list;  they may take a vote of no-confidence. If the vote of
     no-confidence passes with 2/3rds majority, the RECC will refer this
     issue to the Z1C for mediation or action as the Z1C sees fit.

     The ZEC shall be allowed to take issue with RECs that are not
     participating or doing their job, by taking the matter up with the
     host RC of the REC's region and the Z1C for mediation or action.

     These two actions shall NOT be taken lightly without all due
     consideration of possible extenuating circumstances.

     3) Coordination with the other ZECs.

     4) Central repository of information for the various Z1 distribution
        systems.

     5) Mediation of Zone 1 echomail issues/disputes.

     6) Upper level mediation between Moderators, Fidonet distribution
        systems on related echomail issues.

     7) Coordination with the Echolist Keeper.

     8) Help in the formation and implementation of a Zone/Fido-wide
        Echomail policy. The ZEC shall work in conjunction with the RECC
        on this issue, so that the REC's can take this information to
        their respective regions for feedback.

     9) Term(s) of no more than 2 years.  No limit on number of terms

     10) Codify, with the RECC, the procedure for future ZEC elections.
         All future elections are subject to review by the Z1C..

     11) Provide for an interim Z1EC, should anything happen to currently
         seated Z1EC to prevent him/her from fulfilling these duties. The
         single duty of the interim Z1EC shall be to expedite an election
         and the smooth transition to the next Z1EC. The interim ZEC shall
         refer to the Z1C for help with problems if the RECC cannot resolve
         said issue(s).

     There isn't one. Should there be? If the members of the zone wish to
     have an echo policy I would do my best to see that they have the
     chance to create one. It would be built with their input. I don't see
     there being any particular aura about the title of ZEC that would
     confer special wisdom or power over the rest of the zone. I see the
     ZEC as being more a facilitator and interface between the different
     parts of the echo distribution system. Those parts being the nodes,
     the hubs and moderators. All net/region/zone coordinators of whatever
     flavor are servants of their respective area and should be doing what
     is in the best interest of the area.

     In summary, I don't 'feel' much of anything for echomail policy.

      LG 5> Are there any functions not listed in the job description that
      LG 5> you think are important?

     I am sure that my interpretation of the ZEC duty suggestions as
     outlined above will differ with others. For example, I interpret #4
     as publishing a master list of echos which combines all echo titles
     and shows what is available from each distribution system. There is
     currently no central source for any node or HUB who is contemplating
     a switch to a different feed to know what is available on the other
     system.

     I would also delegate specific jobs if I found the load too heavy. Of
     course I would remain responsible for the proper completion of the
     job and any deputy would be answerable to me directly.

     Another example, I don't consider #8 to mean the ZEC writes the
     echomail policy or puts into it what he feels is advantageous to his
     faction. I would interpret that to mean assist in the mechanics of
     setting up whatever mechanism the people of Zone 1 want to assist
     them in creating an echo policy, should they feel an echo policy is
     needed.

     I would also ensure that I have a drop dead deputy available to step
     in and act on my behalf should something happen.

      LG 6>  Do you anticipate any problems working with the Z1C, the
      LG 6>  RECs, the EchoList Coordinator, or those who run the major
      LG 6>  and minor distribution systems?

     Nope... So far I don't seem to have pissed off too many people and I
     try to be moderate in all things. I dislike fanatics and fanaticism
     and am usually content to ignore them until they go away but have
     been known to blast with both barrels on occasion.

      LG 7> What do you think the major echomail problems in the next two
      LG 7> years will be?

     Integrating FIDO with new technology to maintain our supremacy in
     high signal to noise ratio mass communications. Our content is very
     similar to internet mailing lists in that our conferences are usually
     topical and spam free yet we use a method similar to newsgroups in
     that any node whose HUB receives an echo can link to it instantly.
     Helping FIDO to grow and adapt to the changing technology will become
     FIDONEWS 15-01               Page 27                   5 Jan 1998


     more important as time rolls on. Currently the overwhelming majority
     of traffic in FIDO is passing around the zone without standard LD
     charges.

     Zone 1 has an almost 100% saturation of ISPs available and that means
     that almost anyone who wishes can move their traffic via the
     internet. That spells an end to the strife caused by CRP feeds. For
     pennies per day and an FTP account anyone can get darn near anything.


     For years FIDO has had a centralized mail routing system. It
     currently flows via the echomail paths. With the increase in
     individuals connecting directly to ZHubs class servers mail routing
     dynamics are changing. I am not sure if the complexity has increased
     or decreased but it seems that reliability is up. It used to be that
     hardly anything would arrive on a timely basis if you routed it out
     through the net. Now, I am seeing replies back in a few hours from
     messages I have sent as routed netmail. Yes, sometimes the various
     HUBs get confused as to where someone's mail goes but that is
     generally limited to people who have changed feeds recently. Once the
     feed is stable, it should remain functional with minimal maintenance.


      LG 8>  With a two year term, Jan 1, 2000 comes on your watch. What
      LG 8>  role do you see for the Z1EC at that time?

     Much the same as I see it now. The ZEC is a servant of the zone,
     working for the ZC, assisting the regions work with the various
     distribution systems and working with the rest of the zones on
     interzonal echomail issues. Unless something drastic changes in the
     next two years, there will still be nodes, echomail, regions, zones
     and distribution systems.

      LG 9> Any other comments?

     FIDO is a hobby for me, it is not a career move. I feel I can make a
     decent contribution to the betterment of the zone or I wouldn't have
     agreed to run.

     1998 Z1EC ELECTION -- CANDIDATE QUESTIONNAIRE
     --------------------------------------------------
     1> What are your qualifications? What FTN positions have you held?
     FIDONEWS 15-01               Page 28                   5 Jan 1998


     I was NEC of Net-109 for five years, (one of the larger nets in Zone
     1) re-elected to the position annually. I have been REC of Region 13
     for 19 months. I have functioned as the major Net-109 echomail hub
     for 7 years. I have had RHub status for 3+ years.

     2> If elected Z1EC, would you continue with other currently held FTN
     positions?

     The next REC-13 election is scheduled for the April/May timeframe. I
     would not stand for that election. I would probably continue to be a
     mail hub. I've always felt that it is important for an *EC to be
     active in the mail moving department so that they are aware,
     first-hand, of the various problems.

     3> Do you foresee any problems with the list of duties for the ZEC
     position?

     No.

     Which of those functions do you consider most important?

     Paragraph 6: Upper level mediation (and, adding in co-ordination)
     between Moderators and Echomail Distribution Systems.

     4> How do you feel about Echomail Policy?

     I believe that there needs to be an Echomail Policy. I think that
     getting one properly approved is going to be similar to trying to
     build a snowman in Panama!

     As ZEC, it is something that I would keep on the table with the RECC
     and that as a group of 10 REC's and the ZEC that we would keep
     plugging away on in an attempt to get some progress made.


     5> Are there any functions not listed in the job description that you
     think are important?

     No. If there were, I would have provided that input during the
     formulation of the description.


     6> Do you anticipate any problems working with the Z1C, the RECs, the
     EchoList Coordinator, or those who run the major and minor
     distribution systems?

     None at all.


     7> What do you think the major echomail problems in the next two
     years will be?

     We are going to see more and more interaction with the Internet. The
     present policies, specifications, and procedures were developed in
     the '80's. They don't consider the Internet.

     FIDONEWS 15-01               Page 29                   5 Jan 1998


     Law enforcement agencies are becoming more computer-literate. There
     is more and more public pressure to get 'obscene' information off of
     the Internet. The Internet is a hard animal to attack. Fidonet Sysops
     are much better defined and much easier to see and find. I think that
     Fidonet is going to be subjected to much more scrutiny by law
     enforcement agencies as to the content of the traffic they are
     carrying and moving, primarily because it's a lot easier to find a
     Fidonet Sysop, than it is to find the "Internet". I think that
     Fidonet Sysops will be seeing more 'witch-hunts' about the content of
     echomail.

     8> With a two year term, Jan 1, 2000 comes on your watch. What role
     do you see for the Z1EC at that time?

     That question is not clear to me. On the one hand, it is redundant to
     Question 7. If you are referring to the 'Year 2000 Problem', I doubt
     that it will have a lasting effect on Fidonet Sysops. We may see some
     'interesting' quirks during the first few weeks, particularly with
     software that is checking the age of messages, but those should be
     able to be dealt with swiftly.

     If you mean, "What will the Z1EC's job be in January 2000?", I don't
     have an answer for that one. I think that in the next two years that
     we will see a lot of changes, just as we have seen a lot of changes
     over the past 18 years in any two-year segment you want to pick. A
     lot is going to depend on the mix of REC's and the thoughts and ideas
     that they bring to the RECC table.

     9> Any other comments?

     As ZEC, I would like to see some standardization for the movement of
     echomail. The specifications that we are presently working with are
     7-15 years old. This, in a technology that vastly changes on a daily
     basis. Software authors are pulling their hair out trying to write
     software that will work under all imaginable conditions - including
     some VERY bizarre conditions that they should not have to be
     considering.

     Ideally, I would like to see a Fidonet-wide FTSC become VERY active
     and to codify some specifications so that all authors would be
     singing out of the same hymnbook. Barring that, I believe that it is
     possible to formulate a set of technical criteria that all traffic
     entering the "Echomail Distribution System in Zone One" has to meet.
     This has nothing to do with content or purpose. But, it does mean
     that all traffic must be technically correct. Time/date fields
     properly formed. A proper Origin Line. A Path line. A MSGID line.
     Etc. Major mail movers already know what those problems are and are
     trying to protect the distribution systems from damage caused by
     those problems. I believe that, in some way, we need to 'officialize'
     much of this.

     I believe that there is room in the "Echomail Distribution System in
     Zone One" for a multitude of distribution systems. I see no reason
     why all of them can not work together in a harmonious, co-operative
     relationship. As ZEC, I would work diligently toward that end.
     Retailers have done this for ages.

     I see the ZEC in a true co-ordinator role. He depends heavily on
     input from the REC's, and moves forward with their ideas, even if he
     doesn't fully agree with the majority of them. The future of
     Fidonet's echomail is more in the hands of the REC's than in the
     hands of the ZEC. But, even more than in the hands of the REC's, is
     the work and efforts put forth by the NEC's!

     Retrofitting & Updating Conference Naming Conventions

     12/29/97
     Net 261 Local EchoMail & FileBone Naming Convention Proposal
     (Maybe even the Entire Network)
     by Gordon Malone 1:261/1195, g.malone@ix.netcom.com


     I originally intended to present this proposal to my local and
     Neighboring Nets, 261 and 109. Only after contemplating the
     possibilities and benefits did it make sense to offer it to the entire
     net as food for thought and hopefully action.

     Since joining FidoNet some 8 years ago I noticed that tossers were
     incomplete in the way they sort or display listings. Sure, they work
     fine by default to sort by name, but not by group. Some authors of
     processors have made attempts and some have even had success (Harald
     Harms - ALLFIX file processor) in providing a means for displaying
     areas by group to facilitate easy maintenance.

     Unfortunately, not all tossers of either flavor, mail or file have
     adopted this common sense approach as a 'standard' and we're left to
     muttle through due to lack of foresight as best we can and Fido as a
     whole, is slow to implement forward thinking ideas and concepts that
     would foster growth and ease of use or operation. There are MANY
     networks now available to join with echoes that certainly duplicate
     echo names.

     With that in mind, I'd like to propose that we take steps to improve
     and insure two things.

     1) An easily identifiable naming convention prefix for the net that
     would both make grouping and editing much easier and faster,

     2) Eliminate the possibility of duplication of conference names
     imported and processed from any source.

     This could easily be accomplished through the use of a naming PREFIX
     FIDONEWS 15-01               Page 31                   5 Jan 1998


     policy much like that used by the InterNet. Why shouldn't we adopt
     tried and true solutions? It only makes sense that we use FIDO.261
     as our prefix...

     I'd like to put this suggestion to all of FidoNet and especially our
     neighbors in Net109 with whom we share local echoes. Who knows, maybe
     it'll spread throughout Fido. I'm surprised it hasn't happened sooner.


     Proposal:

     Below is an actual sample of areas in our FIDONET.261 area file
     that our NEC just released:

     ADS109          ;ads, including commercial
     AUTO109         ;automatic announcements (mainly files)
     AUTO261         Automatic messages                      OPEN
     BALTIMORE-BBS   BBS Notices, Ads                        1000
     BURPNET         ;Brewers United For Real Potables
     CATS            Feline Friends (Local)                  OPEN
     COMMUNITY       Community Association Stuff             1000

     Under the new naming convention they would look like this using the
     network.net.<areaname> Prefix:

     FIDO.109.ADS109
     FIDO.109.AUTO109
     FIDO.261.AUTO261
     FIDO.261.BALTIMORE-BBS
     FIDO.261.BURPNET
     FIDO.261.CATS
     FIDO.261.COMMUNITY

     It's real easy to see what area comes from where and there is
     little possibility of duplication prohibiting the addition of
     duplicate echo names from different networks.


     Conclusion:

     I realize that this would cause some minor disruption during the
     renaming period, but the future benefits and ease of operation, I
     feel, make it well worth the small amount of work involved for us all
     to accomplish this. Maybe the MODERATOR conference would be a good
     place to discuss a possible self imposed cutoff date which could be
     agreed upon to have the ELIST updates submitted by.

     Kinda funny when you stop to consider all of the power we have, yet we
     don't know how to harness and exploit it like everything else we
     devour... Years ago I thought we'd have .WAV or some kind of
     compressed voice email conferences with threads going by now... If
     only we knew what we were doing. It's scary, or is it just me...?

     If we're all not working to constantly improve and build on the net,
     what's the point? Isn't that what a network of like minded folks is
     all about!
     FIDONEWS 15-01               Page 32                   5 Jan 1998


     As you can see, not only does this naming convention make it
     undeniably clear of the echo origins, but editing within *any*
     processor system will be universal. Searching and constant referencing
     printouts, or jumping between windows would be eliminated when doing
     updates. All areas would be displayed in order, together and sorted by
     NETWORK.NET.<ECHONAME> regardless of the processor used, as long as
     they utilize some sort of sorting method, which most do.

     An added bonus to the two benefits above, AUTOADDING in a myriad of
     processors and BBS systems, with more control of defaults will now be
     possible, allowing and promoting greater participation and/or
     expansion locally.

     In closing, I respectfully request that our leadership, software
     authors, moderators and potential new echo submitters seriously
     consider implementing this proposal, for all of the reasons and
     benefits stated above. We can retrofit and bring the net up to speed
     if we want to...

     At the risk of sounding 'corny', IMHO it is our duty, if we truly
     enjoy and care about this hobby, to do whatever makes sense to build
     upon and improve every aspect of the hobby that presents itself...

     Comments Anyone? :)

     Cheers!

     Gordo
