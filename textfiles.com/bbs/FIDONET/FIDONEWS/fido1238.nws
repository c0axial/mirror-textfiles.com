Hellloh,
   Ii'm hoping you will accept apologies from me if you were
trying to send an article while the bbs wasn't answering, which
happened for about 3 days in the middle of the week.  An additional
submission tel# will be available as soon as possible, and it will
be (519) 570-3137, maxwell's daemon, 1:221/194.  Please wish me
luck!

   Apparently there's some wierdness happening in St. John's
New Brunswick or was it Newfoundland? having something to do with
the nodelist and policy, and you won't have the details until next
issue.  oops, sorry 'bout that.  i am busy learning about time,
which is very different from timeing.  plasmic.

   also, i've been finding some wonderful articles in the garbage,
lately.  it's a-maze-zing, what some people would toss.  freely!
i'm glad they do it.

New Digit Postal Code (Singapore) !

Crossposted from: LC:Chit-Chat

Hi every Singapore Residents out there !!!

       Well, I believe you have been informed of the new digit
postal code of all addresses in Singapore. If you have not been
informed of your new code, you will be soon. Anyway, I have found
out how it works (only for flats) for the changing of postal codes.

 Resident's Flats :-

 e.g.  Blk 123 Choa Chu Kang ............. Singapore 2368

       new code will be : 680123
                            xxxx
       (the xxxx is the building/block/house number).

 Resident's private condos/bungalow/semi-d/etc :-

   e.g.  89 Faber Green Singapore 0512

       new code will be : 12xxxx

       (the xxxx is not the house number. How to derive is unknown yet)

   Commercial Buildings/etc :-

   e.g.  50 Tagore Lane Singapore 2791

         new code will be : 91xxxx

         (the xxxx is not the house number. How to derive is unknown yet)

       I will keep all of you informed if I find out how to derive
the new postal codes for private housing and commercial building/etc.
See you and happy converting your address book.

The Game Development Echo (GAMEDEV)

[posted by Sunir Shah@1:241/11@fidonet.org, moderator of GAMEDEV]

                         !!!NOTICE!!!

  THE GAME DEVELOPMENT ECHO, an echo dedicated to the making
  and producing of games is NOW HERE!

  GAMEDEV covers it all:  from design, to programming, to
  graphics, to sound, to game artificial intelligence, to
  releasing the game.

  If you make games, professionally or as an amateur, or if
  you want to start, why not pick up this echo?  I'm sure your
  users would be interested.  Who doesn't have a neat idea for
  a game?

  Sadly, this echo remains in private distribution.  However,
  if you decide to pick up this echo, we'll surely get it onto
  the backbone in a short period of time.

  Please contact Sunir Shah @ 1:241/11 for a feed.  The tag is
  GAMEDEV.  I'll set you up quickly.

  (current traffic is 70 msgs/month.  Five nodes.  Nodes in
  Zone 3, see below)

For those nodes that are within Zone 3, you may want to try Anton
Winter @ 3:635/544, as he had setup another echo called
OZ_GAMEDEV at the beginning of June.  It may not exist any
longer, as it has been three months since I had the pleasure of
talking with Anton.

"EXPLORING THE INTERNET"  -  FREE ONLINE WORKSHOP PREVIEWS THIS FALL

Unleash the power of your modem and discover valuable  resources  on
the  Internet  in  a  four-week  online workshop that is free to the
public.

"Exploring The Internet" is  aimed  at  beginning  and  intermediate
users.   Learn  the ABC's of FTP, IRC, and SLIP/PPP; discover useful
tips and shortcuts on surfing the World Wide Web.  Find out  how  to
save  money  with  "offline"  news and mail readers, and learn about
low-cost alternatives to Prodigy and America Online.

The workshop is being  sponsored  by  Spectrum  Virtual  University,
which  recently  established  an online campus on the World Wide Web
and is now conducting a summer workshop on dream analysis  that  has
attracted more than 5,000 participants from around the world.

"Exploring  The  Internet" starts in September and will be hosted by
author/editor  Richard  De  A'Morelli,  who  formerly  served  as  a
by-lined  member  of  Irving  Wallace's editorial staff and has been
roaming the Net since the early 1980's.

People are hearing that the Internet  is  full  of  pornography  and
para-  militaries  but  the  fact is, virtually all of the knowledge
that our civilization has amassed since the dawn of history  is  now
accessible  on  the  Internet, if you know where to look for it," De
A'Morelli said.  Colleges, libraries, museums,  magazine  and  music
publishers,  government  agencies,  and  major  businesses  are  now
providing scores of useful services on the Internet, he added.

The four-week course will help newcomers get plugged  in.   Workshop
participants will receive free software; and in some cities, such as
Los Angeles, Spectrum is arranging for new users to  receive  up  to
one month of free Internet access during the workshop.

Besides  helping  newcomers  get plugged in, the workshop will offer
tips on using popular tools such as  FTP,  which  stands  for  "File
Transfer Protocol" and, simply put, allows PC users to download free
software  programs,  electronic  books  and  magazines,  famous  art
replicas,  even  tax forms and samples of hot new music from virtual
libraries all over the world.  Literally millions of such items  are
now online and free for the asking.

Other  topics will include Usenet, the enormously popular network of
nearly 14,000 public news groups; and "mailing lists", which  are  a
cross  between a news group and an electronic magazine.  Some 30,000
mailing lists now exist on the Internet covering  every  conceivable
topic.   Many  lists are moderated which means incoming messages are
filtered and junk mail is purged before reaching your mailbox.

"A Question & Answer  forum  will  provide  step-by-step  assistance
throughout the workshop to those who need help installing or using a

program or  accessing  particular  features.   A  24-hour  telephone
helpline may also be established.

Enrollment  deadline is Friday, September 29.  Those wishing to join
the  class  can  e-mail   Spectrum@PacificNet.Net   to   request   a
registration  form  and  further  details.   Those  who  don't  have
Internet access can register using a touch  tone  phone  by  calling
Spectrum's 24-hour registration line at (818) 899-7888.

99 great places to visit on the inet...the final episode

Best places to get mail: If you want to interact only with people who
really share  your  interests,  check  out  Internet  mailing  lists.
Mailing  lists  differ  from  newsgroups  in  that  you don't receive
anything unless you specifically request it. You can get  a  list  of
mailing     lists     from     the     Internet    FTP    site    pit
manager.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news. answers/mail/mailing-lists.

Best place to buy a new PC: Many software and hardware  vendors  have
online  catalogs. The Electronic Mall (Go Mall) on CompuServe is home
to Mac Zone, PC  Zone,  and  Computer  Express,  among  others.  Many
vendors  are  also  exploring  the  Internet as a distribution venue;
access CommerceNet on the World Wide Web. ZiffNet puts a unique  spin
on  shopping for software.  Although the choices are limited, you can
download  commercial  software  directly   to   your   computer   (GO
ZNT:STORE).  On AOL, the Computer Express database (keyword: Computer
Express) lets you search by specific  product  or  product  type.  On
Delphi, you can access AOL's Computer Express or the shopping service
Comp-u-store Online.

Best places for shareware: One of the cheapest ways to get  shareware
and  freeware is through Internet FTP sites. The best one for Macs is
the Info-Mac archive at sumex-aim.stanford.edu/info-mac. For DOS  and
Windows shareware try ftp.cica.indiana.edu.

Best  place to learn about the Net: GEnie's Internet Roundtable (type
INTERNET- RT at the system prompt) provides introductory tutorials on
navigating the Internet and includes info on Internet resources.

Best  place to learn some manners: Prodigy offers some good advice on
proper online behavior  (keyword:  E-MAIL  ETIQUETTE),  the  dos  and
don'ts of electronic mail.

Best  place  for  gadgets  and  gizmos:  AOL's  Gadget Guru (keyword:
ELECTRONICS) offers  info  and  updates  on  the  newest  and  latest
consumer products.

Best  place for free fonts: CompuServe's Desktop Publishing Forum (go
DTPFORUM) includes information  and  tools  for  desktop  publishing,

libraries for fonts, utilities, software, templates, and art.
