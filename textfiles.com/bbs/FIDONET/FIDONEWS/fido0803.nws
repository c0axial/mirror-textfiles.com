                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================


     For those of you who objected to last week's editorial: you
     are a minority (or at least you're a minority of those messages
     I received). But your point is well taken. I'll try to keep
     these outbursts to a minimum.

     It's sort of funny, though. There are really no particular
     restrictions on subject matter in FidoNews articles. The
     objections I heard seemed to suggest that the Editor has to
     apply restrictions to his(her) own contributions that nobody
     else need be concerned with.

     Balderdash.

     Let me tell you what I did today. I watched two football games on
     my projection TV system, fully enjoying the effects of Dolby
     Surround in each case. I played about 10 games of pinball down in
     the basement. I took the family out to dinner. I moved a bunch of
     files from a scragged Rainbow to one of my clones over a serial
     line. I watched coverage of you-know-what on CNN.

     What does all that have to do with FidoNet? Nothing and
     everything.

     You see, there was really no particular relationship between what
     I did and the technical aspects of operating a FidoNet node. So
     it is logical to assume that there was no relationship between
     today's activities and FidoNet.

     However, in the new social manifestation of FidoNet, the person
     who sits behind the keyboard is an integral part of the network.
     The contribution made to the network by this person is a function
     of everything that person experiences and performs. This leads to
     a logical conclusion that there is a relationship between my trip
     to Chili's with the kids and FidoNet.

     Last week, this tension in the Persian Gulf was occupying my
     mind. I was pissed off that things had reached the stage where
     war was inevitable. I needed to get it off my chest. I did so.
     An amazing number of people shared my feelings and many of them
     indicated that my core dump had been helpful to their own thought
     process.

     When I was finished, I felt better. So did others. I made a
     positive contribution. That makes me feel even more better.

     Perhaps a few of you media critics could try writing the perfect
     article. It would sure be a gas to see someone in FidoNet win a
     Pulitzer Prize. It should be easy. Your only real competition
     would be some war correspondent, and who cares about wars anyway?

                         Your Leader or Your Oil

     Wedneday, Jan. 16, 1991.  I had just finished the readings for a
     Political Science course on International Relations.  Scanning
     through the channels on the vcr I hit CFPL and see they are
     transmitting the live feed from CNN about something from Iraq.
     Wait a minute, it's 7:37pm.  Why is CFPL running a feed from CNN
     in prime time?  Better switch over to CNN and see what's
     happening.  In a lightning swift move, US President George Bush
     has launched an allied air strike on Iraq, and CNN, the little
     network that grew, is the only US or Canadian network that is
     transmitting live.  For the next three and a half hours I sit
     and watch what seems to be a very one sided battle.  As I go
     to sleep, wondering what is going to happen while I sleep, I
     can't help but think that I should have filled up my car's gas
     tank as the price of oil is likely to go through the roof when
     the stock exchanges open.

     Thursday, Jan. 17, 1991.  The hike in the price of oil that all
     the bankers and analists have been forcasting should war erupt
     never happens, but the price of Light-Sweet Crude (the U.S.
     Benchmark crude) has hit a low that only existed before Iraq's
     leader Saddam Hussain moved to illegally annex neighboring
     Kuwait.  And the NYSE rises over 100 points.  What's going on
     here?  From what I can piece together, it looks like Iraq,
     Kuwait, and/or Saudi Arabia will now have a permanent U.S.
     millitary presence, be it in the form of bases to "protect" the
     oil wells in Saudi Arabia or Kuwait, or a multi-national
     occupation force will move into Iraq, dividing it into zones
     similiar to what happened to Berlin after WWII.
     Finally, almost 24 hours after the initial allied air attack on
     Iraq, some of the missles that escaped destruction have been
     fired at Israel.  What launching missles at Israel will
     accomplish, has yet to be discovered.  Israel did not take part
     in the initial attack, but has been singled out as the first
     nation to be attacked in retaliation.  Given the current
     feelings between the Arabs and the Jews, Saddam may have just
     signed his own death warrant.  Israel has repetedly demonstrated
     that it can and will defend itself.

     Now that conflict has begun, we can only hope that it will be
     over soon, and not plunge us into WWIII and/or a religious war
     composed of people of the Arabic faith vs. most other faiths.

           profuse apologies
           =================

     Apologies if the formatting on this one is bad, but I'm doing it
     by hand in FroDo. I may even take the time to do it properly
     later, but since it's just a short one...

           on with the story...
           ====================

     ... in any case, on with the story. As far as non-geographical
     nets are concerned: they're really not needed. There is NOTHING
     in POLICY4 that says you can't get your echomail from whoever
     you want. So, you can get your feed from the net next door if
     you like, and all you have to do is poll your real host every
     now and again to pick up your routed netmail.

     Seeing as the main reason people want to switch nets is to do
     with echomail distribution in some way or another, that little
     realisation should fix quite a few problems.

     Why am I bringing this up? Well, as it was pointed out to me:

      > Giving people a choice of which net they can belong to
      > makes it a social choice, and once a group gets together
      > they can just as easily 'socially choose' to not have you
      > in their net.

     Now, there could be ways in which you could restrict this kind
     of thing happening under a new POLICY (like WORLDPOL), but it
     seems to me that it'd be mightily unwieldy. By the way, the
     worry about this kind of thing happening isn't just opinion --
     it's happening, live. Here's a simplified version of what's
     happening in one area of FidoNet. It's not arranged on the
     ol' geographical boundary system, and...

      > 1) Run a specific type of machine, 24-hours-a-day only, and

      > 2) Run in an alternative independent network where you are
      > forced to pay _heavy_ contributions to the net's echomail

      > "committee". (Among many other restrictions . . .)

     Now, I don't know about you, but that sounds pretty worrying to
     me, especially as I really can see that kind of thing happening
     in many areas of Australia, said areas already having shown
     some pretty spectacular displays of applied politics and in-
     fighting.

     The POLICY4 we're all so "fond" of is quite explicit about what
     you have to do to join FidoNet. It's nice to know that if I move
     house, I'm not going to get locked out of the local network
     because of a personality conflict with my new area's host.

     As before, I'm just throwing stuff around to stir debate. Whilst
     WORLDPOL may be better than POLICY4 in a lot of respects, it's
     not perfect yet, and I'd hate to make a hasty decision on the
     matter.

           post script
           ===========

     PS. I love mail. If \ANYONE\ has any comments to make, send 'em
     in to me! International crashmail is not required -- nor would
     it work (me being a -pvt- node and all). The zonegate, on the
     other hand, seems to be functioning perfectly. Once it hits
     there, the beautifully efficient netmail routing we have here
     in ZONE 3 will get your message to me with loving care.

     Now, the amusing bit -- I leave for the big end of RG50 in a few
     days, and will be there for a couple of weeks. Don't expect any
     huge numbers of replies until then. Sorry.
