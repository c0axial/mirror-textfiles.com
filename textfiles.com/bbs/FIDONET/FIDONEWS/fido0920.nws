Editorial: Same but different

by Tom Jennings (1:1/1)

A couple of smallish items this week.

Back issues of FidoNews -- I do not have anything here at 1:1/1 except
the current issue; not even last week's. I get lots of requests for back
issues, and I don't know what to tell people.

Does anyone have all or many of older FidoSnooze's? Possibly if there
are a number of sources of various vintages, I can list them here, and
have a .FAQ (Frequently Asked Question) file to answer requests. How big
is the total, all volumes 1 - 9?

                                * * * * *

        Subj: Book mention
        From: asuvax.eas.asu.edu!world.std.com!aboba (Bernard D Aboba)
        To:   Tom.Jennings@f1.n1.z1.fidonet.org
        Date: Thu, 7 May 92 16:57:52 -0400


        Thanks for mentioning my book in the recent FidoNews.

        As it happens, BMUG isn't answering their phones anymore,
        due to recent layoffs, so that the book is now being
        sold by several bookstores over the net. These include
        Quantum books (quanbook@world.std.com), and Silver
        City Software (1:213/777).


                                * * * * *

I still get lots of mail erroneously addressed to "zone 1 net 1 node 1",
by a combination of "operator error" and buggy software; when a bad or
missing address is entered or something, the mailer program mails it to
1:1/1. I have long since given up forwarding these things.

Sysops, please check your installations carefully, and look at your logs
(at least for a few months) and check that your mail is going where you
think it is. Mailer authors, make sure that "operator error" or other
failure modes (missing/wrong nodelist files, etc) are clean, and don't
simply send mail into the ether.

                                * * * * *

I also get mail from nodes whose "from" FidoNet address is not in the
nodelist, therefore making it impossible to reply. Sometimes it's a non-
FidoNet address, ie. RBBSNET, etc, and I just K)ill those; I am only a
member of FidoNet. Otherwise, I simply try again "later", in the hopes
that when the new nodelist comes the errant node will be in it. Rarely
does this fix it. If it's not answered within 20 days (my systems old-
message purge time) it simply goes into the bit bucket.

                                * * * * *

FidoNet VERSIONS file: the problem is becoming acute. This week, there
will be no versions list, because it is so damn old. The person who had
volunteered to do take it over, and had shown me excellent examples of
the changes to be made, disappeared, and hasn't replied to messages for
many weeks now.

Hopefully the *next* person who volunteers will get the job done.

                                * * * * *

And last but not least --

I received a rather inflammatory comment to my editorial about the LA
Riot/Rebellion/Whatever, which I am declining to run in FidoNews. Even
if I wasn't the target of the article, it's a flame, and would not run.
See for yourself: it is available for filerequest or download in it's
unedited entirety as file "WEAVER". +1-415-863-2739 3/12/2400/HST,
fidonet 1:125/111 or 1:1/1. (In some eyes, everything not law'n'order
party-line is "liberal" party-line. Not.)

What is FIJA?
by John R. Graham

(* ED NOTE: Sorry to our non-US readers for boring you with
administrivia of the U.S. legal system. -- tom j *)




     FIJA stands for two things. First, it stands for Fully
Informed Jury Association, which is a nationwide organization
dedicated to educating people about the powers and duties of jury
service.

     The jury is the one and only place in American government
where the people really have control. Judges and attorneys have
usurped that control, placing statutes and judge's instructions
above the Constitutional and Common Law powers of the jury.  Those
powers include, but are not limited to:  1) "The jury has the right
to judge both the law as well as the fact in controversy." John
Jay, 1st Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court.  2) "The
jury has the power to bring in a verdict in the teeth of both law
and fact." Oliver Wendell Holmes, US Supreme Court, 1902.  3) "The
law itself is on trial quite as much as the cause which is to be
decided." Harlan F. Stone, 12th Chief Justice of US Supreme Court,
1941.  4) "The pages of history shine on instances of the jury's
exercise of its prerogative to disregard instructions of the
judge..." US vs. Dougherty, 473 F 2nd 1113, 1139 (1972).

     Judges have stolen this very basic right from the American
people by telling juries that their job is only to decide whether
the defendant broke the law. "Whether you believe in the law or not
is not at issue here..." is heard over and over again in courtrooms
across the country.  The opposite is in fact true. The right of the
jury to nullify bad laws (known as jury nullification) dates from
medieval England, when the king and his ministers passed all sorts
of odious laws. A revolution led to the signing of the Magna Carta,
guaranteeing certain rights to the citizens of England. One of
those rights was that no matter what the law said, a citizen could
not be punished unless a jury of his peers agreed that he had done
something wrong.  In America, this tradition was carried over and
violations of King George's anti-trade laws were not enforced by
juries of American colonists. After the revolution of 1776, some
states put the right of jury nullification into their
constitutions, but most thought it was so basic that Americans
would never forget they had that right.  The state of Maryland's
constitution requires that every juror be told at the time of
swearing in that they have the right to judge both the law and the
facts of a case.

FidoNews 9-20                  Page 4                      18 May 1992


     FIJA also stands for Fully Informed Jury Amendment. Many such
amendments are currently being proposed to the voters in various
states. The California FIJA amendment missed getting enough
signatures during the qualifying period to get on the ballot this
year, but it will be brought up again.  Jury nullification was an
import part of the Abolishionist Movement prior to the Civil War.
Juries in northern states refused to apply the "Fugitive Slave
Laws" because the jurors decided the laws were unjust.  It's only
in the last two decades that judges and attorneys have gotten so
arrogant, and American people so ignorant, that this right could
be abridged. It's time we informed the people and took back what
is ours.

The LO NodeList Flag

Michael Toth
The Round Table BBS!
1:115/439.7

I'm writing this because there has been a BIG push to rip redundant
flags out of the NodeList. While I feel that this is good, I'd like to
take this time to bring to your attention the TOTAL LACK of those
people that accept FREQs from Listed nodes Only. That's the LO flag.
While I understand the reasoning of SysOps on wanting people that are
FREQ to be a known entity, and therefore have to be in the NodeList,
then they should have that flag in their List entry.

FidoNews 9-20                  Page 7                      18 May 1992


Whenever I see in RA_UTIL, or another EchoArea, that someone has a
program up for FREQ, I check the NodeList to see if they have the LO
flag set. If they do, then I know it's worthless for me to FREQ from
them as I am a point. If I don't see the LO flag, then I should be
safe to assume that it's safe for me to FREQ. This, unfortunately, is
not the case. There have been MANY times that I've tried to FREQ a
file, just to find the next morning that I've had 12+ failed sessions.
The event that I have setup for that is after Midnight CDST, so I'm
rarely ever watching the screen. It's VERY costly when that happens. I
understand that that's sometimes the case being a point. I can live
with it. But if they had enabled the LO flag, then I would have NEVER
started that FREQ.

I *DO* have to say that there are many SysOps that use the LO flag.
Also, MANY that allow FREQs from unlisted nodes/points. To those
SysOps, I have to tip my hat and thank them. They have saved MANY
people a lot of money and time.

Also, I'll be changing to a full node soon, so most of this problem
will have been eliminated for my part. But if you think that a LOT of
EchoAreas get gated to other networks, and most SysOps don't carry
EVERY nodelist from all those other nets, then anything from SIGnet to
FidoNet is from an unlisted node. It can get VERY costly in the long
run.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

Michael S. Toth
Wonder Lake, IL.

The Black Hole
by Peter Danevicius
1:247/205

A black hole.  One envisions images of massive voids in outer space,
spaceships getting sucked into them and lost forever, the captain of
the Enterprise issuing frantic orders to avoid it, the great unknown
void...

Unfortunately, this has nothing to do with my article.  I will speak
of a phenomenon that has plagued all of Fidonet since its inception;
The Black Hole of Fidonet.  Where did that message go?

A typical situation: I'm talking to Joe Blough in the FLAME echo about
training my Airedale to attack unwanted religious solicitors that
appear at my front door.  The moderator rules this conversation
off-topic, so we decide to resume this discussion in netmail. Aren't
we the ideal Fidonet participants?  I send off a netmail message to
Joe in an attempt to re-establish our conversation, via my NC or
whatever means I use to send routed net mail, and receive no reply.
Two weeks later, Joe posts a message in FLAME, telling me how he hopes
FidoNews 9-20                  Page 8                      18 May 1992


my Airedale poops in my petunias because I didn't answer his net mail.
Sound familiar?

What happened to the message I sent him?  What happened to the message
he sent me?  Answer: The Black Hole of Fidonet.  It's there, it lives.
It feeds on our messages.  It must be stopped.

We are all pleased at the liberation of former USSR countries.  It
always amazes me to see so many Eastern-bloc countries joining Fidonet
in such large numbers.  Am I making an incorrect assumption that just
because they are in the nodelist I can send them mail?

I have, on several occasions, tried to send routed net mail to
Lithuania. I've sent messages in both English and Lithuanian in
attempts to establish contact.  All of these attempts have,
apparently, failed.  Not being satisfied, I sent netmail to several
sysops of "key nodes" and the *C structures in Europe asking if they
could help trace my messages.  Apparently, these messages have failed
to reach their destinations also.

Once I've finished recovering from my last phone bill (it was a
doozie!), I'm going to try a direct phone call to Lithuania.  I'm
anticipating this effort will be successfull, but my concern will
still remain: How do we rid ourselves of The Black Hole of Fidonet?

I have conducted netmail conversations with people in Great Britain,
Italy, Australia, Switzerland and, of course, the USA.  The foundation
of a properly functioning network is there.  It's a great feeling when
it actually works.  Why does it occaisionally fail?  What is going
wrong?  What can I do to help?

I'm not trying to affix blame to anyone here.  I believe there are
problems that could and should be corrected.  I don't imagine I'm
alone in my quest to contact people in other countries and, no doubt,
peole in other countries may want to contact me or us.  Is this too
high an expectation?

Again, I humbly ask: What is going wrong?  What can I do to help?

SCI&TECH: Science & Technology Discussions without the nonsense!
David Bloomberg, 1:233/12


Are you tired of the so-called "science" echos where more time is
spent arguing over religious, philosophical, moral, and political
issues, rather than science itself?

Well, you're not alone. To cope with the need for an echo strictly
devoted to today's world of science and technology, we have created
the SCI&TECH echo. This is THE place to discuss the newest discoveries
the world of science has to offer, or to talk about something you
learned years ago, but never really quite understood. Come to learn,
or come to teach. Talk about the latest articles in the popular press,
FidoNews 9-20                  Page 9                      18 May 1992


or in scientific journals. The SCI&TECH echo is open to all levels,
whether you're a scientist or a student.

So, if you're interested in discussing science and technology without
having to wade through all the religious/moral/political echo noise
involved in SOME echos, check out SCI&TECH!

Currently, the SCI&TECH echo is available from the Region 11 backbone,
or from Hector Mandel at 233/15. We are only one or two steps away
from the backbone, so if you can't afford to pick SCI&TECH up
yourself, request it from your NEC and REC.

For more info, talk to Hector Mandel at 233/15 or David Bloomberg at
233/12.

The AIRGUN Echo

               AIRPOWER Airgun Echo Now Available!
               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     AIRGUN, the EchoMail version of the AIRPOWER airguns message
base is now available for importation by other Fido-Net Systems!
If you are the system operator of a FidoNet member BBS and would
like to carry the Airgun Echo, contact me via Netmail for more
details and to arrange a feed.
     AIRPOWER has been online 24 hours per day since March of
1990, serving users across the nation interested in the pleasures
of shooting and collecting precision adult airguns.  Activities
covered include collecting, silhouette, field target shooting,
small game hunting, pest control, and many technical and legal
issues.  Precision airgunning represents shooting pleasure on a
human scale, without the excess power, noise, smoke, and harsh
recoil of firearms.  Message volume currently averages 5 to 10
a week.  If you are interested in carrying the AIRGUN Echo on your
system, I only ask that you poll at least once a week in order to
present a current message base to your users.

*CONFERENCE FOR BODYWORKERS NOW AVAILABLE ON BACKBONE...

Massage and Bodywork Conference (BODYWORK) now 'boned

FidoNews 9-20                  Page 10                     18 May 1992


Do you know the difference between shiatsu and acupressure? When
is massage most beneficial to a pregnant woman? What are the pros
and cons of National Certification in Professional Massage and
Bodywork? Did you know that JH Kellogg (of cereal fame) also was
a major proponent of massage in America? How can you protect your
major assets - your hands - from occupational injuries such as
Carpal Tunnel Syndrome? What makes a "good" massage "good"?

These are but some of the topics that are discussed in the Massage
and Bodywork Conference, now on the Fido backbone. BODYWORK is a
public forum linking up massage practitioners and bodyworkers from
different parts of the county, sharing information and questions,
trying to create a common "language" between the many different
styles and approaches to working with the body. It is also an area
for the non-professional to ask questions, to discover what the
myriad forms of bodywork are all about, to share their experiences.
BODYWORK is a place to investigate "healing" touch, to educate and
to learn about the body, and to discuss recent developments in this
rapidly growing field. Please join us.

Latest Greatest SoftWare Versions
Latest Update: 01/27/92

[...]

Well, since as of this writing it's been four (4) months since the last
update, and no word from the project leader, I'll consider the list dead
for now. I also no longer have copies of all the list-update-requests
sent to me during that time.

It may be time to rethink this entire project. Possibly it should be
spawned off as a completely separate project by competely different
people?

Whew, what a nice short newsletter this is.
