                              Waiting for Nets

        I don't know about you, but I'm eagerly awaiting June 12th.  
        That's the day we start using multiple nets, and I can start 
        making some sense out of my node list.

        I also know of several Fidos in this area that have just 
        started up, and that are waiting for their node numbers.  
        Bad news, guys.  No new node numbers until the 12th.  Hang 
        in there!  Just a little longer now!

        Seriously, this isn't like the wait for version 10i.  That 
        was dependant on testing and debugging, and we all know how 
        THAT works.  This is a definite.  As of June 12th we switch 
        over to the new system.  No ifs, ands, or buts!  You MUST 
        have Fido version 10i or greater by then, or you'll be 
        dropped from the node list.

        Oh, yes, in case you haven't heard, there is a "greater" 
        now.  Tom Jennings released Fido version 10j for the IBM-PC 
        and the DEC Rainbow a few days ago.  This is mainly a bug 
        fix release.  (300+ people can find a bug faster than you 
        would beleive!)  There was some sort of problem with the

        Index command for messages.  Also, Fido was dropping a 
        character every now and then when it was unpacking its 
        packets (a very subtle bug; you probably never even 
        noticed).  I don't know what all else was done, but it's 
        mainly cleanup type stuff.  And sorry, still no debug 
        messages during downloads.

        Also no "list of nodes in a file" any more.  It's a shame, 
        too.  After all, he'd just gotten around to documenting it.  
        I haven't checked with TJ on this, but I suspect I may be 
        partly responsible for the loss of this one.  I gather it 
        was mainly there to make it easier for TJ to send out 
        Fidonews, but I use Robot instead.  Regardless, it's a 
        feature that I know several people will miss.

        I've spoken to the guys in St. Louis, and they've promised a 
        couple of articles about the upcoming changes.  I don't 
        think they'll get here in time for this issue, but they 
        should be ready by next week.  Ben Baker promised an article 
        on what, exactly, it means to be a regional administrator, 
        while Ken Kaplan is working on an article describing how the 
        nodelist is going to change.  Both articles should be very 
        informative, and I'm sure you won't want to miss either of 
        them.

        Briefly, the nodelist format is changing drastically.  The 
        master list will no longer be useable directly by Fido; you 
        will have to run it through a new version of NODELIST.EXE 
        before you can use it.  The point of this is to combine the 
        nodelist and the fidolist into a single file, which 
        NODELIST.EXE will use to generate a Fido style NODELIST.BBS 
        and/or a human readable list of nodes.  The new format 
        should make it easier for all the various hosts and admins 
        to keep thing up to date, since only one file needs 
        updating.  

        Once Ken has the current node list converted to the new 
        format, he'll start splitting it up and mailing the various 
        pieces to the hosts and admins who will be maintaining them 
        in the future.  I'm hoping to get an article in the near 
        future describing the whys and hows of maintaining a 
        regional list.  In the meantime, PLEASE don't anybody go 
        assigning node numbers until we are on the new system!  
        Things are going to be confusing enough as it is.  Just hang 
        in there, guys.  Only a couple of weeks to go!


                           National Fido Directory

        In order, an apology, an explanation, an update, and a plea.  

        First the apology.  I spoke too soon last issue, and 
        incorrectly.  Dave Horowitz is NOT the guy coordinating the 
        national directory.  He's been pushing for it and working on 
        the programs, but his system doesn't have the space to 
        handle it.  Matt Kanter at Fido 1/79 has volunteered to 
        contributed a machine to handle the data, so he's the one 







FIDONEWS     --           27 May 85  00:00:30           Page 3

        running it.

        Next the explanation.  The idea is to create a national 
        directory of Fido users, showing which nodes they can be 
        reached at via Fidonet (sort of a Fido phone book).  This 
        would be done by having various (hopefully most, if not all) 
        sysops send an abstract of their user list (NOT including 
        any passwords!) to a central point, where the data would all 
        be collected, sorted, and formatted into a master list.  
        Contribution would be completely voluntary.  It would be 
        nice if you contributed, but it's no problem if you can't or 
        won't.  (Some company boards, for example, can't release 
        their user list without breaching confidentiality.)

        Now the update.  Dave has written a program, called 
        SHIPUSER, which Matt has been busily sending to boards all 
        over the country.  If you haven't seen it by now, you can 
        pick it up at 1/51, 1/79, 1/375, and probably at any major 
        host in your area.  SHIPUSER reads a USER.BBS file and 
        creates a text file giving the name, city, and number of 
        times called.  Matt is figuring on munging it all by hand 
        the first time, then automating it later if this catches on 
        (as I hope it does).

        And finally, the plea.  Please run SHIPUSER on your user 
        list and send its output to Fido 1/79.  This is a great 
        idea, and we'd all benefit from a national directory, but 
        (like many things in Fidodom) it depends on your voluntary 
        contribution to make it work.

        Another thing in Fidoland that needs your contribution to 
        work is Fidonews.  Last issue was kind of skimpy, and right 
        now it looks like this issue will be even smaller.  If 
        you're not sure about the format standards, just ask and 
        we'll send you a copy of FIDONEWS.DOC.  This newsletter is 
        nothing without YOUR input!

        The following was uploaded to FIDO#74 (The Bear's Den) by 
        one of my regular users.  I am not sure what board it came

        We have another trogan horse amongst us... it is called 
        TPSECRET.BAS and was Uploaded here two days ago by a SAM 
        HOLMES (from Laurel, MD, a 1200 baud caller). This protected 
        (SAVEd with ,P) BASIC program simply does a very nasty "KILL 
        *.*" and a "KILL A:*.*"... Beware of this program and this 
        person... If SAM HOLMES turns out ot be a real person, I 
        will contact the T-Systems' lawyer, and begin a law suit... 
        for rarely are such Uploads from "real" people, and such a 
        prank is certainly destructive enough to warrant action. If 
        Sam turns out to be the Uploadee, I will keep everyone 
        informed of progress...

                Here's some stuff on that article, I just had to
        respond. Thanks for reading so far. If you have any
        questions, comments or whatever you can call me at the above
        number any day from 8 AM til midnight.


                There were some serious errors made in the article
        "MODEM BATTLE BREWING" on page 16 of the 29 April issue on
        the XMODEM protocol.

                Before talking about the specific problems, a
        misconception needs to be cleared up. The word "XMODEM"
        refers to both the protocol and is also the name of a
        specific CP/M program for remote bulletin boards. "XMODEM"
        is now taken to mean the binary protocol, not the name of a
        specific program residing on someones disk. This can be very
        confusing, but unless you are talking about a specific copy
        of a specific program, Xmodem refers to the protocol.

                It is completely untrue that Xmodem cannot run
        beyond 1200 baud, and equally untrue that it does not detect
        errors reliably.

                The original Xmodem program, XMODEM, MODEM7 and all
        it's variants, have a software bug that prevents them from
        operating at above 300 baud. It is a bug in the
        implementation, not the protocol, and has been there for
        years. My implementations of Xmodem (and many others') have
        been used for over three years at up to 38,400 baud (as fast
        as my serial ports go) with no problems whatsoever. The same
        program can communicate to any original XMODEM program on
        MSDOS or CP/M. In the FidoNet Bulletin Board Network, a
        public domain packet switching system consisting of more
        than 250 computers in the US and Europe, many nodes are
        using 2400 baud modems quite reliably, thank you.

                The error checking isn't quite as bad as many would
        lead you to believe. The original program by Ward







FIDONEWS     --           27 May 85  00:00:36           Page 6

        Christensen had only a simple checksum error check; later
        versions implement a CCITT CRC-16 error check. Also, there
        is some doubt as to whether CRC error checking is all that
        much better than checksums over dialup telephone lines;
        while it is true that adjacent single bit errors can get
        through Xmodem's checksum process, errors on phone lines are
        almost always burst errors (that is, many bytes are trashed
        by noise on the telephone), these are very rare, and so in
        "real life" Xmodem is quite reliable. In any case, CRC-16 is
        available. In any case, the worst case error rate is
        something like 0.035% using checksums. No protocol can
        guarentee 100% accuracy, no matter what they may claim.

                Xmodem has many faults, such as half duplex
        operation and requiring an eight-bit data channel (can't be
        used through Telenet or TymNet...), but it extremely easy to
        implement, and is very reliable if done right. It is surely
        far from perfect, but is very suitable for small computer
        use where the constraints don't matter. 

                You will also notice that the biggest detractors are
        firms with commercial interest in their own protocols. As to
        the importance of the Xmodem protocol in the real world,
        keep in mind that the modem manufacturers (and many others)
        who came out with software products with "improved" (read:
        incompatible) protocols were forced by the micro marketplace
        to retrofit Xmodem. Two examples are SMARTCOM and CROSSTALK.

                Ward Christensens protocol has problems, as he will
        admit, but it is still very strong and usable in the current
        environment. There are probably 10,000 bulletin board
        systems in the US that support Xmodem, and probably ten
        times or more individuals that use Xmodem with bulletin
        boards or for point to point use. It may be an "underground"
        protocol, but it works well in practice, and introducing new
        protocols will have to take this huge base of users into
        account.
