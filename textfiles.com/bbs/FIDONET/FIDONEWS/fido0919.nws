Editorial: Whatever

by Tom Jennings (1:1/1)

Last week I made no mention of the post-verdict rebellion in Los
Angeles. It was too immediate to comment on. You are hereby warned --
the following paragraphs are my take on it. Skip this if you don't
like it.


It was a rebellion, not merely a "riot". Poor people rebelled; many of
the poor people there were black. It is not a cooincidence that black
people are the poor ones. This has been enforced by whatever means are
necessary and at hand.

Racism by itself is not "it" -- if black people were economically on
equal footing racism would not be very powerful. Media is trying to
reduce this "event" to "racism". It is class warfare. According to the
New York Times (Apr 92) "1% of the US hase more economic resources
than the lower 90%". Only ten years before, it was 10% (instead of
1%). Cooincidence?

It did not start on April 29th. It is not over now. Or as local
columnist Herb Caen said, Bush is wrong: it wasn't "liberal welfare
policies" that started this; it was that damn Abe Lincoln with his
Emancipation Proclamation. (That is irony, don't flame me). You
figure out the implications.

Observations that "those (four?) black guys beating that truck driver
is the same as/just as bad as/ those cops" beating Rodney King is
racist bullshit (not having thought it out is no excuse). They were
damn criminals -- but the cops were professionally trained, with the
backing of the legal system, sophisticated communications systems, and
extreme-tech weapons at their disposal. They were not abberations --
they were trained to do that, to punish, at street level.

Federal troops were favored over local (Nat'l Guard, etc) because
it allowed them to effect a media blackout, as they did in the Gulf
War -- the violence actually *ESCALATED* over the weekend, not
subsided -- my source? A friend talking to a person whose wife is an
emergency-room nurse, on duty that whole weekend. They routinely
monitor the police frequencies, for advance notice of medical
disasters, etc.

The death count leaped from 30something Friday, to 50+ Sunday night,
with no explanations. Federal troops were *shooting looters*. Shooting
people, to protect *property*?

FidoNews 9-19                  Page 2                      11 May 1992


The jury was tampered with, in the usual legal manner of tossing out
anyone who has an opinion, skill or shows intelligence. The jury was
told explicitly, and illegally, that they could not "vote their
conscience" but only look at the law. This not only undermines the
U.S. legal system, but all of the good parts of the last few hundred
years of Western Law.

Will some FIJA (Fully Informed Jury Assoc) person(s) submit an article
covering that process and right, for FidoNews?

Contrary to some media coverage, rioting and looting in downtown San
Francisco was not racial. It was purely class/economic. My source? I
was there. Even the cops are saying it was extremely mixed racially.
(Though numerically, 90% of the *arrested* looters were white).

More on local troubles: you might have heard about all of the
"rioters" arrested in the Mission District, "breaking curfew".
Hundreds of people were arrested hours before the curfew took effect,
and arrested as the came out of subways, out of grocery stores,
completely unaware of goings-on. Hundreds. One friend was corralled at
7pm at 18th/Mission, and the police report says 11PM (2 hours after
curfew) and at 24th/Mission, where a large protest was taking place.

Even if protesting is stupid, it is anyone's damn right to assemble in
public. There was no looting/violence in San Francisco except Thursday
night. Friday night was completely peaceful; I drove around and
looked. It was obvious to anyone that there was no need for the Friday
night curfew, which resulted in more arrests in the usual places;
black negighborhoods, gay neighborhoods, etc.

On top of all this, some of my friends were self-oppressing
themselves, terrified, refusing to go outside, afraid of "black
muggers" and other non-events. Other, so-called liberal types climbing
over each other to "denounce the violence" that "makes us all look
bad" and "undoes all the work we've done" and other fair-weather-
friend nonsense. And one idiot on the street, as I was relating my
observations of Thursday night to a friend, snootily attacked me for
"condoning violence" simply because I was not "condemning" it as I
spoke. "Just because those of us who work within the system..." etc.

The whole thing is disgusting. We are in serious trouble.


                        * * * * *

On a happier note, there's the INTERUSER thread, which is actually
remaining quite calm, overall. However, what you see in this issue of
FidoNews will be the last on this subject; I've never heard back from
Dave Rawson, so I'll assume that everything has been covered in that
department.

These items relating to the INTERUSER problems will hopefully
illustrate the complexity of issues around communication, fairness,
etc. ad nauseum.


I received a well-thought out suggestion for FidoNews that deserves
mention here:

        Upon reading your latest editorial in Fidonews 9-17,
        I wonder why you don't just adapt the methods of most
        newspapers. Articles in the news sections of most
        newspapers reflect the general news of the area. Here
        you can publish all articles will relate to Fidonet,
        both technical and procedural.

        Any other articles (including flames, attacks, etc)
        would fall under the "Letters to the Editor" category.
        Here you would be free to publish what you wish, when
        you wish. As the editor, the editorial is a way for you
        to promote your feelings, goals, priorities, agendas,
        whatever. In Letters to the Editors, you would be able
        to post those items which you feel expand or present
        opposing viewpoints to those articles or editorials
        which are in the system.

Actually an excellent idea; however I think FidoNews would balloon
into a humungous file monster, and what I've tried to do is include
letters (like yours!) in essentially this way, selectively. I think
also, the FidoNet itself *is* the "letters" section of FidoNews (for
a rather twisted, egocentric point of view :-)

And further:

        PS: Please lose the "Latest Fidonet BBS and Mailers
        section". It's getting way too large and includes all
        sorts of irrelevent information. Or, perhaps just
        insert it once a month, preferable as a separate file.

Funny you should mention this. The VERSIONS list has been given to
someone who is converting it to a database, for ease of update; how it
will be included within FidoNews is actually up for grabs. I agree
it's far too large. I'm favoring occasional (monthly?) full list
inclusion, and only "changes since last list" (ie. deltas, ie. diffs)
weekly. With the whole shoebox available from the FidoNews BBS.

I apologize to everyone for how out of date the list has become; I
swear, before June a new list will be in place or the current one
removed.

                               ARTICLES
======================================================================

Aaron Goldblatt, a user on 1:130/405

I've been out of touch with FidoNet of late.  In January I was forced
to take my point down (1:130/32.1) for personal reasons, and, among
other things, I lost contact with some great friends.  A great many of
them appeared in the INTERUSER echo, and came from places as far away to
me as Estonia is from the United States of Texas.

I've recently started to get back into the swing of things with the help
of some local sysops that I helped get rolling.  They know that I like
to read the Snooze so they put it up for me and I download it when I
can.

In 915 I was very upset to see the article "Everything In Moderation" by
Ann Ioannides of 1:135/54.  At the time I read it (and wrote this) 918
was current and I had yet to see a response from anyone other than tomj
on the issue.  The promised last word from Dave Rawson never appeared.

I wish to clarify a few things in the absence of Dave's rebuttal, not
to poke, flame, irk, irritate, vex, harry, harrass, or otherwise
piss off Ann, Dave, tomj, Tomas, Daan (the other moderator) or any of
the other folk involved.  But my own experience with the moderators of
INTERUSER may shed some light on a situation that has, so far, only
one side to the average reader of FidoNews (is there such a thing?).

Back in about, say, 1989, I bumped into a confrence called POLITICS and
became active there. I was pointed by some of its participants to the
INTERUSER confrence, which a local sysop agreed to carry for me. I
introduced myself in message and got a very nice netmail response from
the then-sole?-moderator, Tomas Bremin.

Things bumped along.  I went down and came back a few months later to
find that Tomas had stepped aside. Dave Rawson became the moderator for
the Zones 1 and 6 sides of the operation, and Daan van Rooten (did I
spell that right?) became moderator over in Zone 2.

Things began to change in INTERUSER. It always seemed to me that Tomas
was an "active" moderator, that everyone knew who he was and what he
did. When Dave took over the active presence of the moderators seemed to
go away, and I did comment on it at one point. It turned out that,
instead of resorting to echomail messages they were netmailing their
hearts out trying to enlist the cooperation of users and sysops that
way. Excellent strategy.

And then it changed again, and they became much more active in the echo.
They reiterated a few long-standing rules:
    o Real names
FidoNews 9-19                  Page 6                      11 May 1992


    o No test messages
    o No one-liners
    o The usual (flaming, illegal stuff, etc.)

A number of users saw these restrictions (apparently for the first time)
and asked why they were put in place.  I explained to a number of these
people why each of these rules was present.

    o It is general custom to use your real name in echomail.
    o INTERUSER is distributed over at least three continents, and test
        messages and one-liners serve only to add to the traffic level
        while not adding to the content level.
    o In many countries where INTERUSER is distributed a sysop can be
        held responsible for material on his system, whether or not it
        originated there.  Therefore, such things as posting Nazi
        propaganda (by whatever name) is prohibited, because in some
        countries where INTERUSER is carried, the spread of such ideas
        is illegal.

On the point of message overhead, a little education was required.  Once
I took a one-liner and posted it with all the AREA, kludge, Path,
Seen-By, and * Origin lines exposed for the user to see. Many users were
surprised by just how much information is carried in one message.

The reason the Seen-Bys and Paths are important is that INTERUSER is
carried by a great many systems - listings for those systems pile up
quickly on the bottom of a message.

And add to that the fact that INTERUSER is one of the largest echos in
FidoNet.  One normal afternoon I pulled in over 300 messages in FidoNet,
with no feeds reported down in the past week. If there was a major mail
holdup, mail dumps in excess of 2000 pieces were not unheard of on my
system, depending on the scale of the problem.

The moderators asked me to write a short file on WHY the rules were put
in place. I started and then went down, never completing it.  At the
same time, I made Dave Rawson an offer, and therein lies one possible
explanation to a charge that Ann made.

Dave had posted that he spent a lot of time moderating INTERUSER, which
I can believe. I offered, in netmail, to help him with the job. I never
received a response. About the same time, Dave disappeared from the
echo. At first I suspected a feed problem somewhere upstream and
reported so in the echo. Then I did a little checking on other systems -
all over the United States - that carry the echo (addresses talen from
Origin lines). Mail from Dave Rawson was not present on any of them. And
since Dave comes from Zone 1 the possibility of a Zone 1 <==> Zone 2
link failure affecting me in this way seems remote at best, especially
given that I could not find mail from him in New York, Florida,
California, Kansas, Indiana, or Chicago.

FidoNews 9-19                  Page 7                      11 May 1992


I sent more mail directly to Dave's bossnode - crash netmail on my own
dime, not routed, so I know it got through.  I also asked the bossnode
what was up.

To quote Ann's article:
AI> ...I sent out this mail on February 9th, and again on the 29th.
AI> To the date of this writing, I have received NO RESPONSE from Dave
AI> Rawson, who was apparently the one that had me banned.
[end of quote]

To date I have seen no response from Dave, either, on my offer to help
with moderatorship.  While I certainly concede the point that Dave may
simply be ignoring Ann's netmail, I see no reason why he would ignore
mine, when he asked me to write that explanation file, thereby implying
that I was something of a respected participant in INTERUSER. I am more
inclined to believe that Ann's messages suffered the same fate as mine
did. But I don't know what fate they suffered, unless, maybe, his
bossnode is deleting it (a charge I do NOT make).


While I would not presume to make assumptions about Dave's policy on his
inbound netmail, I would not be surprised if he doesn't ignore the mail
he gets - our mail just got dropped in the bit bucket somewhere.
Stranger things have happened (I found a green sock in my laundry - I
don't have any green socks).

May I suggest, in the interest of INTERUSER harmony, that Ann, Dave,
Daan, and Tomas (if he's willing) figure out a way to fix this
misunderstanding? There's room for everybody in INTERUSER, and in
FidoNet, for everybody, if we can just compromise and work out problems
once in a while.

Let me point out once again that, as far as I know, Ann was always a
reasonable participant in INTERUSER, and Dave, Daan, and Tomas were
reasonable moderators, and that I consider all four of them my
friends. I would be pleased to share an echo with them at some
future date.

Oh, Ann, to answer your question:

AI> My question is this:  What can I do?

Nothing, other than talk. Points and users have no rights in Fido,
remember?

Subj: Moderation

Hi, Tom.
Just wanted to comment on your comments (oh boy, this is getting
confusing already) about the article in Fnews 915. I agree with you
that the article probably should not have run was written since it
made some claims which may or may not be substantiated. I do feel,
however, that the questions brought up by the article are worth
asking.

When a user feels that s/he has been wronged by a moderator, or that a
moderator is doing a lousy job, what can be done about it? Of course,
the user can always stop using the echo or ask the sysop to reconsider
carrying it, but it seems that these are just band-aid solutions and
don't address the real problem. Just last month, for example, I saw an
echo moderator ASK the echo's users to flame another user.

In any case, getting back to the article, I think the story told there
did a good job of pointing out what can happen and the frustration
that can result. (Though perhaps it would better have run without the
more pointed details)

On an unrelated topic, I agree wholeheartedly with your note in Fnews
916 that you consider the FIDO community to include sysops and users
alike. After all, it's the users that give FIDO the patronage and
support that we all enjoy. I have FIDOnews readily available to my
users (though I don't think any of them read it. Guess it's the
thought that counts).

To: Tom Jennings on 1:125/111
Subj: Interuser, Ann Ioannides and all the rest

[...]

First, let me inform you (for fairness), that I, too have been thrown
out of INTERUSER once. This was because I flamed the moderator 'in
public' because in my eyes, he had not the right to act as he did. I
regard this as another story from what I would like to tell you below.

FidoNews 9-19                  Page 9                      11 May 1992


This story is about moderators. Sure, a moderator is omnipotent, but
there should be rules against abuse of power in Fido in general.

See, a moderator is not controlled by anyone. In the case of
ASIAN_LINK, we were lucky, that the mod broke his own self assigned
rules and therefore disqualified himself. But what happens, when a
self-assigned, or otherwise non-elected moderator abuses power? The
Echo goes down the drain.

The atmosphere is poisoned and there is nothing to do against it.

In the case of INTERUSER, the moderators did not control the echo,
they reigned it (and still get away with it). All the principles of
democracy, free speech and protection from the governing organs are
partly reduced and some (see above) do not even exist. I regard this
as a problem, since, as I have seen they did not care to reply to Ann
after she asked them to rectify their decisions. Is that right?
Doesn't she, at least deserve an appropriate answer?

And isn't giving the moderators, who have more power than the points
and users, the last word a way of 'giving them a chance to get away
with it'? Anyway, I would like to have discussion on that topic, since
it interests me how the founder of Fido thinks about the development
of his 'creation'.

Hope not having offended you.

Please, reply on this message and tell me, if you are interested, to
'roll up things a bit' on this case.

Heisenberg: Move over.

It's a sad state indeed when one is motivated to remove someone elses
postings from ones system - sans revue - quickly and without fuss. Yet
there are needs. And a sort of 'electronic black hole,' so to speak,
is available into which one may dump unwanted garbage: The Bit Bucket.

It can hold a _lot_ of trash and never get full. And narry a 'vomir,'
if I may translate a vulgarity into French thus rendering it sweet.

Version 2.2 of the EXCLUDE project is being released. This project will
erase inbound Network mail or Echomail based upon a bewildering variety
of selection criterion before you, the weary reader, must review it
and hit that ever-so-powerfull button: The Right Arrow Key!

FidoNews 9-19                  Page 10                     11 May 1992


Placed into the batch file after the tossing of mail, EXCLUDE will scan
for and erase undesireable *.MSG messages, retaining a log of what has
been removed. Selections of messages to erased can be based upon:

        o Keywords appearing in a systems title
        o Nodelist flag groups
        o Predefined network address
        o 'From' name or 'To' name of the message

Pretty ugly? You bet!

Needed? Sometimes - for short periods only, usually. Until the problem
eventually goes away. Historically they do.

Usually, you would toss the mail, bundle it up for the nodes you feed,
and then exclude that which is undesireable from your local message base.
This sequence is done because it's generally considered that you have
NO right to erase other peoples mail for them before they get it. (And,
in fact, I agree with this totally.) Historically, this is what's done
with the Killer Dog utilities available to date. You would typically only
exclude messages 'down-stream' from you if you are the moderator of a
conference or you ask your feed to provide the service for you.

The magick name is EXCLUDE. File name is EXCLUDE.LZH. It's 38K and contains
the source code. (Its distribution configuration file excludes mail from
systems which are designated as systems which would attempt to force their
mysticisms into our school rooms -- you will probably wish to replace
the configuration file with one of your own.)

FidoCon 1992
David Deitch

First, I do not mean to detract from Dallas or the various nets
involved in its FidoCon proposal.  I am sure that they will
produce a very successful convention.  My displeasure is directed
at whomever is responsible for the selection process.  Or lack
thereof.

In October of 1991, Net 133 of Atlanta sent messages to the Zone
Coordinator, George Peace, requesting information about bidding
for FidoCon 1992.  We were sent a copy of last year's bids and
no further information.  Upon requesting information on the
bidding process, we were told that there was none scheduled yet.
No deadline was set, and follow-up messages reflected no change.

In November, after every indication that there was no plan for a
FidoCon 1992 bidding process, we asked the ZC to inform us if
and when they decided to accept bids.  Imagine our suprise when
Dallas won a bidding process we never knew about.  Atlanta is a
tremendous city already known for its convention and tourist
facilities.  Given the chance, we could have had a fair contest
with Dallas.

But we were never given the chance, and that is not acceptible.
The ZC and whomever is responsible for soliciting/evaluating
FidoCon bids need to rethink their disinterested approach.
FidoCon bids should be open to all, not just those in the
priviledged information circle.

Rush-Fan Echo

Over the past several months the RUSH_FAN echo has taken off to a
pretty decent start.  This echo was begun by myself to allow die-hard
Rush-Fans the chance to exchange information concerning the band and
any anecdotes or trivia one may have on the group.  The Rush_Fans echo
is now being seen-by eighteen BBS's in Fidonet in the Continental U.S.
and Canada...I'm hoping a few more can and will join in the festivities
so I'm re-submitting this article to Fidonews.

If you wish to get started with the echo (the more the merrier!) please
send me netmail at 1:141/885 or 1:141/1800 or contact me on my BBS-
The Cygnus X-I Opus-Gamma in Connecticut at 203-628-9702.  I only ask
that you poll my system for the packets once every week or so since
the traffic is not that intense.
