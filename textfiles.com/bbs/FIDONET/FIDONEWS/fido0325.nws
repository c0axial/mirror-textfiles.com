     =================================================================

     This week's guest editorial is by Ken Kaplan,  the  International
     FidoNet Coordinator.

                          FidoNet Business Meeting


     We're finally getting IFNA set up as  a  non-profit  corporation.
     This has several benefits,  the main one being that we can now go
     hit some of the major corporations for  grants.  With  any  luck,
     this  will  provide  for  most of our operating expenses one day.
     Meanwhile,  thanks to all of you who have donated.  Without  your
     help, we wouldn't have the seed money to get this thing going.

     But a corporation needs to do certain things.  One of the  things
     we need to do is have an annual business meeting,  to  do  things
     like report on finances,  vote on officers,  and such.  The first
     IFNA  business  meeting  will  be  held   during   the   upcoming
     International FidoNet conference in Colorado Springs.

     One  of the things we'll have to discuss is how to organize these
     meetings.  For now, we are assigning one vote to each network and
     region.  So if you're a network host or a  regional  coordinator,
     please  try  to make it.  If you can't make it,  then please find
     someone in your net or region who IS going,  and make  them  your
     representative.  Please  send  a  message to me at 1/0 letting me
     know if you'll be there, or who you've picked to represent you.

     If there's anything in particular you'd like  to  see  discussed,
     then send me a note about it.  All suggestions are welcome.

     Please try to make it to Colorado in August.  Sally and I will be
     there, and we're looking forward to meeting you at last.

                        by Ben Baker - Fido 100/76

          Much has been said in the past few weeks, in these pages and
     elsewhere, about EchoMail.   Packed  in  the  archive  with  this
     newsletter  is a file, POLICY2.DOC, an update of the prior policy
     document.  It sets forth the "official" IFNA view on EchoMail.

          I'd like to set down some of my own  views  and  to  perhaps
     shed   some   light  on  the  thought  processes  underlying  the
     formulation of the new policy document.

          I  consider  EchoMail  to  be a very good thing for FidoNet,
     which is, after all, a communications network.  Many of  us  have
     beaten  our  heads  against  the  wall trying to get our users to
     communicate via FidoNet with,  at  best,  only  limited  success.
     Fidonews                     Page 3                   30 Jun 1986


     EchoMail  seems  to  be  succeeding  where  pleading and coercion
     failed, probably because many don't realize they  are  using  the
     network when they enter a message in an EchoMail conference area.
     It's no different than entering a message in any  other  "normal"
     message area.

          But  EchoMail  can  be  both a blessing and a curse.  It has
     raised the level of traffic considerably.  In and of itself, this
     is  not  bad.   FidoNet is nowhere near saturation, but there are
     choke points.

          FidoNet's original intent was, and it  remains,  to  provide
     fast,  economical  point-to-point electronic communications.  Our
     standard of service goal is over-night delivery of point-to-point
     messages.   Many  things  beyond  our  control  can  prevent  the
     achievement of this goal.  But EchoMail is (or should be)  within
     the  scope of our control.  It must not be permitted to interfere
     with point-to-point communications.

          Just  how  does  EchoMail  interfere?  The biggest burden is
     placed on the network hosts, and they have two different kinds of
     problems  with  EchoMail;   communications  saturation  and  disk
     storage problems.

          Consider the plight of the bi-directional host, the guy  who
     both  receives  and  sends  mail  for his network.  Since he must
     listen for incomming calls between his  outgoing  calls,  he  can
     make  at  most  twenty to thirty call attempts during the FidoNet
     one-hour mail window.  If he has a (very good) 75% success  rate,
     he  can expect to send out about eighteen to twenty-two packets a
     night.  An already busy host can easily  be  swamped  by  two  or
     three  locals,  each  engaged  in two or three different EchoMail
     conferences.

          But what of the out-bound host who  doesn't  have  to  worry
     about  incomming  calls.   He can operate in a send-only mode and
     make rapid fire calls.  Fido 100/10 has successfully sent as many
     as  forty packets in a single night, and averages twenty or more.
     It takes a lot to saturate his ability to communicate, but he has
     another  problem  with EchoMail.  He operates on the thin edge of
     poverty where free disk space is concerned!

          When you do a DIR in a message area and see all  those  tiny
     two  to  three hundred byte message files, you tend to think your
     capacity to hold them must be nearly infinite, but not  so!   DOS
     allocates  a  minimum of one full cluster (that's four kilobytes,
     folks) to every message!

          Worse yet, point-to-point messages  tend  to  be  short  and
     concise.   Usually  they  are  are  four or five liners stating a
     single point of information.  On the other hand,  the  nature  of
     EchoMail tends to encourage long messages.  When you expound on a
     philosophy or support an opinion with  convincing  argument,  you
     tend to use a lot of words.

          Now consider a hypothetical situation.  You're a host and on
     Fidonews                     Page 4                   30 Jun 1986


     a  particular  night two of you locals each have six new messages
     in some conference area for which they each mail  to  five  other
     participants.   They  each  send you a packet of thirty messages.
     In packet form the messages average say 4K, so you need  240K  to
     store the two packets.  At the end of the collection schedule you
     unpack the packets, and the messages expand to an average  of  6K
     because  DOS  only  allocates space in 4K chunks.  So you have to
     find room for 320K worth of messages.  Of course you  delete  the
     first  packet  before  you  unpack the second, so your high water
     mark so far is only 540K.  But now comes  the  FidoNet  schedule,
     and you must packetize all those messages without deleting any of
     them!  You build ten outgoing packets  of  28K  each  (allocation
     granularity)  and you now have 600K tied up in EchoMail to handle
     ten innocent messages!  Oops!  You only had 580K when  the  night
     began, so you got the "Disk Full!" message when building packets,
     and YOU DIDN'T SEND ANYBODY ANY MAIL AT ALL!!!

          A similar scenario would illustrate that the  in-bound  host
     is succeptible to exactly the same problem!

          So  here's  the IFNA point of view.  The network host has an
     obligation to strive for the standard of  service  of  over-night
     delivery  of  point-to-point  mail.  He should attempt to support
     EchoMail so long as it doesn't interfere with his first priority.
     When  it  does,  he  has  the  right,  nay  the  duty,  to impose
     restrictions on the EchoMail users.  Imposed restrictions are not
     punitive,  but merely the ordering of priorities, and EchoMailers
     are expected to cooperate.  The degree of restriction will depend
     on  the  severity of the specific problem and will be entirely up
     to the affected host.  We want to encourage EchoMail and  see  it
     work, but not to the detriment of FidoNet.

          That  would  have  been  all  I had to say, but here's a new
     wrinkle not covered by POLICY2.DOC (because we didn't think of it
     until  a  situation  was brought to our attention).  What are the
     special responsibilities of a network host  who  participates  in
     one  or  more EchoMail conferences?  How do you resolve the issue
     when  his  activities  begin  to  impact  his  locals  who  don't
     themselves participate?  I'd like to hear your ideas on this.

                          An Introduction to ASCII


     The proper and correct names for all those  funny  characters  on
     your keyboard, and in computer related text.  Here is the correct
     explanation.  Ignore all others;  this is of course the  absolute
     truth.

     ASCII  characters  sometimes  use  parity;  parity is a method of
     confusing your computer into thinking that  the  characters  sent
     are  something that they are not.  Parity has no practical use in
     real life; large computers use parity as part of their religion.


           Space. You can't see it there.

     !     Surprise mark; dammit; Incorrectly called "exclamation
           point" by foolish grade school teachers. Usually you will
           find either none or too many; every! other! word! will!
           have! one! or! more!!!

     "     Quote; double quote. Usually put around words the author is
           afraid he doesn't understand; for computer programs, it is
           the latter.

     #     pound; sharp; it must be called either pound or sharp, even
           though it never means either.  This is a secret password
           into computer priesthood.

     $     bucks; or, as originated by Digital Research, "the end".
           Actually, as far as DRI goes, its pretty prophetic ...

     %     percent; Used in drawing ugly boxes around useless text, as
           in bulletin boards and the like.

     &     and, in logical expressions; ampersand elsewhere. It looks
           nice and is hard to draw by hand. Let your printer do it.

     '     little quote; single quote; apostrophe to ignoramuses.
           Since it is very small and hard to see, some computer
           languages use it as an important operator.

     (     paren; left paren; open paren; or parenthesis, which is way
           too long a word. Used to correct compiler bugs in operator
           precedence, or by incompetents who cannot memorize a few
           hundred simple rules.

     )     paren; right paren; close paren; parenthesis. See above.

     *     star; blob; blatz; asterisk. Yet another horrible character
           used to draw boxes. Like most of these, it is used far too
           often to be of any use.
     Fidonews                     Page 6                   30 Jun 1986


     +     plus; "and" if you're sloppy. Connects things together, and
           is sometimes used by people who want to draw boxes but can't
           afford graphics.

     ,     comma; what can I say?

     -     minus if near a number; dash otherwise. Some word
           processors try to fool you that a bunch of these in a row
           is really the end of a page; we know better than that.

     .     point if near a number; dot otherwise. Three dots together
           (like ...) can be called "dotdotdot", but it is really an
           ellipsis. This is another test for computer priesthood.

     /     slash; divided by; a good compiler will find many
           different, conflicting uses for this in different contexts.

     0-9   You know these. 0 is not "oh", it's zero, and is greater
           than 9, as we all know.

     :     colon; I have heard that human colons do not resemble this
           in the slightest.

     ;     semicolon. (Actually, its more than a colon, not part of
           one, it has a tail, but alas ...)

     <     angle bracket; less than. Can be put to great use when
           attempting to define the syntax for a computer program,
           like so:

                     PROGRAM ARGUMENT [optional { ...<required> } ]

     =     equals

     >     angle bracket; greater than

     ?     question mark; what; denotes confusion.

     @     blob; at; bang. Usually what your terminal displays just
           before going south with all your days work.

     A-Z   If I have to tell you ...

     [     bracket; square bracket

     \     backslash. There is usually a slash (regular style) to be
           found near by to check that you are paying attention.

     ]     bracket; square bracket

     ^     hat; incorrectly called caret. Sometimes means "Control-",
           as in "Control-C", syntactically similar to "Shift-A".  ^A
           is to a as A is to a. Sometimes used to cause arithmetic
           overflows; as in 100^5000.

     _     Underscore; incorrectly called underline. This is a
     Fidonews                     Page 7                   30 Jun 1986


           wonderful character, because you really can't underscore
           another character without writing a long letter to your
           word processor, requesting it do do so.

     a-z   See note above on A - Z

     `     accent; backwards quote (sic). Not used in any computer
           worth anything. These are meant to be deleted when found.

     {     wiggly bracket; squiggly bracket; incorrectly called brace.
           While you may think it is like angle brackets and square
           brackets, it most definitely is not.

     |     bar; vertical line. Why does it have that little piece
           missing?

     }     wiggly bracket; squiggly bracket; incorrectly called brace.

     ~     wiggle; squiggle; traditionally called a tilde, which is
           obscure enough to continue using. Only very good languages
           find a use for this. It is extremely hard to see,
           especially when near a dash, little quote or back quote.

           Aha! Can't see that either! Its a delete!

     Robert Briggs, 15/464

         WARNING   WARNING   WARNING   WARNING   WARNING   WARNING


     I've been ripped off to the tune of $700 by PC's Limited, 7801 N.
     Lamar, Suite E-200, Austin, TX.

     This whole situation started on the 27th of March,  1985  when  I
     originally  ordered the drive.  I used the drive to bring up Fido
     node 15/464,  and used it for about 5 weeks.  Unfortunately,  the
     drive that I originally obtained from PC's Limited was faulty, it
     crashed almost weekly,  and each time it was re-formatted, it had
     more and more bad sectors show up.  It was returned to  them  for
     repair.  It  came back "Dead On Arrival" - the person responsible
     for Quality Controlling the drive failed to  retract  the  heads,
     this  resulted in a bad track 0 which made the drive unusable.  I
     had since purchased a larger drive,  and had made arrangements to
     sell  the drive to someone else.  Needless to say,  the buyer was
     no longer interested in buying a hard disk from me.

     The drive was once again shipped back to them on June 7th,  1985,
     accompanied  by a letter requesting a refund.  (it is interesting
     to note that the RMA number issued the second time was 3436,  the
     first  RMA  was  2973  - that means that in a period of roughly 2
     weeks,  PC's Limited had 493 defective products shipped  back  to
     them!)

     There  was  no  response  to  my  letter,  nor any repaired drive
     returned.  I was unable to contact the person who was responsible
     for handling refunds.  Two months later,  I  sent  the  following
     letter addressed to the Chief Executive Officer of PC's Limited:


         Robert S. Briggs
         P.O. Box 7175
         Murray, UTAH   84107-0175

         08 August, 1985

         Dear Sir:

              It  has  now  been over 60 days since I returned my disk
         drive to your company for a refund,  and  nearly  six  months
         sine  I  originally  purchased  the  drive,  (which has never
         worked correctly).  While I (am) normally quite patient, this
         situation is causing me to become angry enough to  take  some
         rather strong measures to recover my money.  Unless I receive
         my $695.00 refund check by the 21st of August, 1985, I intend
         to do the following:

         1.  Send  a  copy  of  this  letter  and  a  formal letter of
         complaint to Byte magazine, PC magazine,  and any other major
         magazine that I can find one of your advertisements in.

         2.  Publish a copy of this letter in the public domain, and a
     Fidonews                     Page 9                   30 Jun 1986


         warning about both the type of service and equipment that you
         seem  to  be  providing.  In  addition,  I  will request that
         anyone reading  that  warning  distribute  it  to  any  other
         bulletin  boards that they use.  I expect that such a warning
         would be distributed to well over 2000 bulletin boards  in  a
         matter of several weeks, making this letter available to well
         over  200,000 readers by the middle of September.  This could
         have a great impact on your sales...

            The situation is becoming ludicrous; I have been unable to
         contact the mysterious Tammy (the person handling refunds) in
         nearly two months of calling two days a week.  A typical days
         worth of calls (my local time) goes something like this:

          9:00 a.m. Not in yet              10:00 a.m. Not in yet
         10:30 a.m. Not in yet              11:00 a.m. Out to lunch
         12:00 p.m. Out to lunch            12:30 p.m. Out to lunch
          1:00 p.m. Out to lunch             1:30 P.m. Out to lunch
          2:30 p.m. Out on break
          3:30 p.m. Left for the day - try tomorrow

            I have enclosed a copy of my invoice;  my original copy of
         the  charge  slip  was  sent  in the last time I returned the
         drive for repair.  The last return of the drive was under RMA
         #3436, the drive was "DEAD ON ARRIVAL" when returned from RMA
         #2973 repair (due to the heads not being retracted  when  the
         drive was shipped back to me).

            I  would  appreciate your prompt attention to this matter,
         and hope that this whole situation can be settled swiftly and
         in a friendly manner.

                             Sincerely,

         August 29th, 1985


         Dear Advertising Editor,

              I would like to make a formal complaint against  one  of
         the  companies that advertises in your magazine.  It has been
         nearly six months since I first ordered a 20  megabyte  drive
         from PCS Ltd.,  (the drive was originally ordered in March of
         1985),  and in that time they have failed  to  deliver  me  a
         either  a  functional  disk drive,  or the refund that I have
         been requesting for over two months now.

              Enclosed please find a copy of a letter that I  sent  to
         the  Chief Executive Officer of PCS Ltd.  on August 8,  1985.
         There has been no response to this letter.  As  nearly  as  I
         can  tell,  I  have  simply  been "ripped-off" for the sum of
         $695.00.  If there is any way  that  you  can  assist  me  in
         recovering  the  original  sum,  I  would be pleased,  I have
         already "written off" the money spent in long distance  phone
         calls and shipping.

              Unless  I can recover my money in the near future,  I am
         going to place a description of what I have been through  and
         copies  of  the  correspondence into the public domain with a
         request that it be distributed as widely as possible.  It  is
         a  last  resort  and  a  one  way step - once done it can not
         easily be undone - but maybe I can get some satisfaction  out
         of  keeping  other people from making the same mistake.  I am
         not vindictive and would be more than happy to let the  whole
         matter drop upon receipt of a check for what I am owed.

              I  would  certainly  appreciate  any help that you could
         give me in this matter.

                                            Sincerely,
                                            Robert S. Briggs


     On September 13th,  1985,  I received the following  letter  from
     Byte  magazine.  It  is  nice  to  know  that at least one of the
     magazines was interested and courteous  enough  to  reply.  Looks
     like I will have to re subscribe to BYTE magazine....

         Dear Mr. Briggs:

         This  is  in response to your letter of August 29,  a copy of
         which we are forwarding to PC's Limited.  Rest  assured  that
     Fidonews                     Page 11                  30 Jun 1986


         we  shall  use  whatever  influence  we  have  to get them to
         satisfactorily respond to your complaint.  Please also try to
         understand that  it  is  impossible,  both  logistically  and
         legally  for  us  to  try  to  resolve  all  disputes between
         advertisers in BYTE and their customers.

         The best  we  can  do  is  to  provide  a  conduit  to  start
         communication between the advertiser and the customer, and to
         cease  offering  advertising  space  in  our  magazine  to an
         advertiser  when  a  clear  pattern  of  unresolved  customer
         problems  appear.  With  your  complaint,  we  are  sincerely
         attempting to facilitate discussion between the parties which
         could lead to an appropriate resolution.

         We are asking both you and PC's Limited to keep us posted  on
         any  results obtained from our transactions.  Thanks you very
         much for your patience and information.

         Dear xx. xxxxxxx,

              This is in reply to your letter of September  10,  1985,
         concerning  PC's  Limited.  I  believe  that I have allowed a
         sufficient  time  for  PC's  Limited  to  reply,  so  I  must
         regretfully   state   that  I  have  received  absolutely  no
         correspondence from them.  I must also assume that they  have
         chosen to not reply because they have no intention of issuing
         me a refund - they have simply "ripped me off" to the tune of
         $700.

              I hope that there is some pressure that you can exert on
     Fidonews                     Page 12                  30 Jun 1986


         them  as  advertisers  in  your magazine.  I am also going to
         correspond  with  the  Attorney  Generals  Office,   consumer
         complaint division,  and the Better Business Bureau of Austin
         Texas, in hopes of getting some response (i.e. a refund) from
         them.

              I am preparing to distribute all of  the  correspondence
         to  date to each of the nodes in the FIDO network (watch your
         BYTE  bulletin  board,   all  of  this  information  will  be
         distributed  under the file name RIPOFF$.700 or pc-ltd.rip or
         something similar) and will request that it be  passed  along
         to  any bulletin board that the users know of,  and I hope to
         have copies  of  all  of  this  correspondence  published  in
         several IBM-PC specific newsletters.  This action should make
         this  whole  situation  available  to  approximately  200,000
         readers in a matter of roughly two weeks,  and could reach  a
         million PC users, by word of mouth, in roughly a month.

              I  do  not  understand why PC's Limited is forcing me to
         pursue  such  an  unfriendly  course  of  action.  I  am  not
         alleging mail fraud, but I think that anyone is entitled to a
         refund and a letter of explanation after attempting to obtain
         a working product or refund for over six months.

              Thank  you  for your time and the help that you and Byte
         Magazine have given me.

         October 7th, 1985


         Dear Sir,

              I would like  to  make  a  formal  complaint  against  a
         company  doing  mail  order sales based in your city.  It has
         been nearly six months since I first ordered  a  20  megabyte
         drive  (some  computer equipment) from PC's Limited,  7801 N.
         Lamar,  Suite  E-200,   Austin  78752,   (the  equipment  was
         originally  ordered in March of 1985),  and in that time they
         have failed to deliver me a either a functional  disk  drive,
         or  the  refund  that  I  have been requesting for over three
         months now.

              Enclosed please find a copy of a letter that I  sent  to
         the  Chief Executive Officer of PCS Ltd.  on August 8,  1985,
         and copies of other  correspondence  with  various  magazines
         that   they   advertise  in.   There  has  been  no  response
         whatsoever from PC's Limited, and, as nearly as I can tell, I
         have simply been "ripped-off" for  the  sum  of  $695.00.  If
         there  is  any  way  that you can assist me in recovering the
         original sum,  I would be pleased,  I have  already  "written
         off"  the  money  spent  in  long  distance  phone  calls and
         shipping.


              I would certainly appreciate any  help  that  you  could
         give  me  in this matter.  I am not alleging mail fraud,  but
         the whole situation has dragged on for over 7 months now, and
         I feel that a refund should have been forthcoming long before
         now, from an honest company.

                                            Sincerely,



                                            Robert S. Briggs



     As yet,  there have been  no  replies  to  the  latest  round  of
     correspondence.

     I  guess that I have to leave it up to you,  the reader to decide
     whether I have been too harsh on a company that failed to deliver
     me a working product after more than 6 months,  and who seems  to
     refuse to issue me a refund.

     If you can,  give this file the widest distribution that you have
     available.  Maybe someone else will avoid getting ripped  off  by
     this company.  Maybe even you...


     If you are really into such things, how about sending a letter to
     PC's  Limited  telling them that you have read this article,  and
     Fidonews                     Page 14                  30 Jun 1986


     have no intention of purchasing anything from them because of it.
     Anyone having similar problems with this  company  might  drop  a
     letter to the BYTE Magazine Customer relations department, urging
     them to remove PC's Limited from their advertising.


     You  can  keep  current  on  the  situation  and  get any further
     bulletins from my board at (801) 264-8290.

                                    "C"

     Peeple have bin noan to objekt to my spelling. I am going to take
     this oportunity to fite bak.

     The problem is not with my spelling,  it is with written English.
     As  an  example,  the  letter  "c"  serves  no purpose in written
     English.  For the hard "c" as in "cat",  a  "k"  works  perfektly
     well.  For a soft "c" as in "city",  a "s" kan be used.  The only
     other "c" is the "ch" sutsh as is found in "such".

     In fakt the only  exkuse  for  the  letter  "c"  in  the  English
     language  is  for  proper  names  (peeple,  plases,  and things).
     "California",   "Charles",   and  "Chineese"  (refering  to   the
     language)  should  probably  be spelt the obsolete way,  at least
     till there is an oportuinity to tshange them on  maps  and  other
     rekords.  Of  koarse I see no reason they kould not be refered to
     as "Kalifornia",  "Tsharles",  and "Tshineese" but there may be a
     some unnessessary konfushun.

     One  interesting  example  is  the "Programming Language C".  "C"
     kould be redefined to treat the symbols "c"  or  "C"  as  speshul
     reserved  operators.  The  statement "c name" kould be defined to
     run "name" where "name" is a  string  with  the  name  of  a  "c"
     program.  Identifiers  and  reserved  words  kould  be denied the
     alfabetik use of "c".

     There are many other problems I find with written English. I will
     leave solutions to them to the reader.  I have purposly not  made
     an  attempt  here  to  korrekt all of the follies of our language
     (nor have I made any partikular effort to follow them).

                     Welcome to the Fido prompt writer
                          Written by: Tom Jennings

     I just got off the phone with Tom,  and HE DID NOT WRITE IT!  The
     first  clue  was  that  it  is written in TURBO PASCAL.  Tom only
     writes in C or  ASM.  Next,  the  cute  dialog  in  the  file  is
     atypical  of  what  Tom does.  From looking at the strings in the
     program (using CHK4BOMB), I guess that it will either delete your
     USER.BBS file, or copy it to another file (REPORTS.PAS), where it
     could be downloaded at some  later  date.  Interestingly  enough,
     another  "new  user" was on the next day,  searching all the file
     areas for files of the type indicated in the program.

     It was uploaded to both 109/74 and 109/483 within 1 hour of  each
     other.  If  you  have  received  a  copy of this "gift",  I would
     appreciate getting any information you might have on the fool who
     uploaded it.

     And, if you have run it, I would like to know what happened.

                  Taking Advantage of Your PC's Hard Disk:

                      New York Personal Computer, Inc.

     This article is about organizing files on any hard disk  attached
     to  a  member  of  the  IBM  PC family,  including the PC with an
     Expansion  Unit,  and  certainly,   the  PC  AT.   The  following
     suggestions  have evolved from several months of using the IBM PC
     XT as a follow-on system to the IBM PC.  I  hope  these  thoughts
     prove  useful  to  those  who work with hard disks on the IBM PC,
     particularly those who are new to it.

     File Management

     The hard disk is not merely an  overgrown  diskette.  It  can  be
     used that way,  but you would be inviting serious file management
     problems in doing so.  The hard disk has other  capabilities  you
     should utilize, and there is no reason not to take full advantage
     of the hard disk's potential.

     About the last thing you want to deal with is a ten megabyte hard
     disk containing all its files in one directory. (There is a limit
     of how many files the root directory can contain, so the disk may
     give  you  an  error  message even though much of the disk is not
     filled.) With intelligent organization, the hard disk retains its
     speed advantage over the diskette,  and you are  better  able  to
     keep  track  of your files as well.  The name of each file should
     use filename and the three-letter extension.  Sooner or later you
     will need all the help you can get in remembering what each  file
     contains.   Most  importantly,   though,  your  files  should  be
     organized among several directories.

     The Root Directory

     Each DOS volume (diskette or hard  disk)  has  a  root  directory
     which  DOS  creates when it formats the disk.  The root directory
     on your hard disk should contain a minimum  of  files,  reserving
     the space for sub-directory names.

     Nonetheless,  a  few  files  are essential in the root directory.
     When you format the hard disk, use the /S parameter:  FORMAT C:/S
     which copies three .COM files to your hard disk:

                  (IBMBIO.COM)
                  (IBMDOS.COM)
                  COMMAND.COM

     Notice  that  the first two are hidden files.  You won't see them
     in any DIRectory listing,  but the CHKDSK command will  tell  you
     they are there.
     Fidonews                     Page 18                  30 Jun 1986


     You  should  store the various DOS external command files and all
     data files in other sub-directories.

     Sub-directories for Executable Files

     Now let's  consider  locating  your  various  executable  program
     files--the .EXE,  .COM,  and .BAT files.  You'll want to separate
     related programs into sub-directories of their own.  For example,
     you may want one sub-directory containing all of the external DOS
     commands,  another sub-directory with your word  processing  .COM
     and .EXE files, another with your accounting .COM and .EXE files,
     etc.  until  you have stored all of your executable programs into
     sub-directories.  They are much easier to remember this way.

     The root directory  has  no  user-assigned  name,  but  all  sub-
     directories  are  specifically  created and named using the MKDIR
     command, MD for short:

                   MD anyname

     You can create as many levels of sub-directories as you like, but
     generally, the fewer levels you have to create,  the simpler your
     directory  structure will be.  There will be times when a second-
     or third-level  sub-directory  is  needed  (a  directory  created
     within another sub-directory),  but multi-leveled sub-directories
     create a more complex path structure for both you and DOS to sort
     through.

     Directory Sizes

     You can fill a sub-directory with as many bytes as the disk  will
     allow, but it is often convenient to limit the size of those sub-
     directories  into  which you regularly store data to the capacity
     of a single diskette,  320-360 KB.  This allows you to back up  a
     directory using the COPY command:

                  COPY C:*.* A:

     The  COPYable  directory size offers an alternative to the BACKUP
     and RESTORE commands,  an alternative that many  find  easier  to
     use.  It  offers  portability  as well as backup.  If you want to
     verify the copy with  its  original,  you  can  follow  the  COPY
     command with this:

                   COMP C: A:

     However,  if  you  feel  confident  using  the BACKUP and RESTORE
     commands,  the contents of a single sub-directory can be as  many
     bytes as you like.  The bigger it is, the more time consuming the
     backup process becomes.

     Another  suggestion  is  to  give  each  backup diskette a volume
     label.  This is especially useful if you use the COPY command  to
     back up your sub-directories.  By using the /V parameter when you
     format  the  diskette,  you can label your diskette with the same
     name as the directory it backs up.
     Fidonews                     Page 19                  30 Jun 1986


     It  is  rarely  necessary  to  back  up  the  entire  hard  disk.
     Typically,  you  store  data  changes  in the files of a few sub-
     directories, those few being the only sub-directories you need to
     back up regularly.  Many sub-directories never change,  and  need
     backing up only once.
