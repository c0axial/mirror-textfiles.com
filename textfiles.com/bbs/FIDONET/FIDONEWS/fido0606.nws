     Crimson Ties Questioned in Virus Case

     by James Daly, ComputerWorld Staff

     (originally from ComputerWorld magazine)

     CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - A Harvard University assistant professor,
     systems programmer and graduate student have been ordered to
     testify this week before a federal grand jury investigating the
     spread of a computer virus that ground the Internet computer
     network to a near-halt earlier this month.

     Assistant Professor of Computer Science Mark Friedell, computer
     programmer Andrew Sudduth and computer science graduate student
     Paul Graham are scheduled to appear in a Syracuse, N.Y., court
     Wednesday to explain their connection to Robert T. Morris Jr., a
     Cornell University graduate student and Harvard alumnus suspected
     of creating the virus that struck 6,000 computers nationwide.

     As Federal Bureau of Investigation officers served the subpoenas
     Monday, other federal officers searched Harvard's Division of
     Applied Sciences for computer accounts that may show what role
     that facility played in the virus' spread, a Department of
     Justice official said.

     The grand jury will reportedly investigate telephone
     conversations among Sudduth, Graham and Morris that began shortly
     after the virus began to spread.

     Sudduth, a senior systems programmer at Harvard's Aiken
     Laboratory, where Morris worked for his last two years as an
     undergraduate, has stated that Morris phoned him shortly after
     the virus began.  Sudduth said Morris asked him to sound the
     alarm about the virus and disseminate a message explaining how to
     inoculate computers against it.  According to Sudduth, Morris
     said he was unable to do so because the virus had inactivated his
     system at Cornell.

                    Future Looks Brighter Than Ever
                         for Courier HST Modem
                            by Casey Cowell
                     President, U.S. Robotics, Inc.

       In little more than a year, U.S. Robotics' Courier HST modem
     has established itself as the price/performance value leader
     among high-speed modems.

       Courier HST is a success today because it delivered on
     its very straightforward promise -- to radically improve dial-up
     data communications by using the best ideas and most affordable
     mix of technology.

       And it will be a success tomorrow as it evolves to meet ever-
     growing demands for power, speed, reliability, economy and ease
     of use.

       Courier HST's success must be framed in the context of a
     marketplace rife with unsubstantiated product claims, announced-
     but-undelivered products, a variety of incompatibility problems
     and very unstable pricing.

       As the smoke finally begins to clear, Courier HST
     emerges as the strongest "proprietary" product in the high-speed
     modem market, with tens-of-thousands of highly satisfied users
     and a litany of praise from oft-skeptical industry observers and
     product reviewers.

       Even PC Week, last of the nay-sayers on proprietary high-speed
     modems, admits the Courier HST is "here to stay." Courier HST
     occupies the leading edge of a revolution in modem design that
     has simply outpaced the formal standards process.

       The standards-setting community (CCITT) is slow to
     confer formal recognition upon new technology. For example,
     CCITTa dynamic marketplace.

     Want $50,000 real  quick?    It's easy!  Just pick the right
     numbers just once, and it's yours.  And what  will  it  cost
     you?  Only one  dollar.    Yep!    This small fortune can be
     yours, for the tiny sum of $1.00.  No, really!

     Here's how it works.  You go to Las Vegas, into a hotel like
     The Stardust, and find your way to the Keno Lounge.  Pick up
     a piece of paper with 80 numbers printed on it, mark  15  of
     them  with  a black crayon, and bring this paper to the lady
     at the  counter,  along  with  one  American  Greenback  for
     company.  Be sure to mark the RIGHT 15 numbers!

     You'll  get  a  receipt  in return, along with a ticket that
     shows the numbers you have picked.  Now wait three  or  four
     minutes.

     20 numbers  will  be  drawn,  ranging from 1 to 80.  Each of
     these 20 numbers will be different.  When all 20 numbers are
     drawn, go to the counter, present your ticket,  and  collect
     your  $38,460.65  (the  IRS  is  standing there waiting, and
     every payoff over $1,500 is immediately taxed!).

     What's the matter?  You didn't win a dime?  Well, that's not
     MY fault!  I told you to pick the  RIGHT  numbers,  not  the
     crap you  did.    Sounds  like you need practice picking the
     right numbers.

     Humm.  I've got just the thing!

     It's an on-line game called KENO, and  is  designed  to  run
     from  OPUS,  but any BBS which can run external programs may
     run KENO. KENO handles it's own modem  routines,  baud  rate
     determinations, carrier detect, and user scores.

     KENO may  be  played  over  the  modem,  or  locally.   KENO
     requires ANSI device driver to be installed.

     New users get $105.00 to start.  Every time  they  play  the
     game, they  receive  another $5.00.  The system operator may
     set the KENO configuration file to allow a user to  run  the
     game  each  day from 1 to 32,727 times (I have mine set to 2
     times a day).  If the user runs out of money, she or he must
     wait until the next day to play again.

     The system operator may also tell KENO to exit back  to  the
     BBS  when  the  user  fails  to  enter  a keystroke within X
     seconds  (in  other  words,  the  SysOp  may  control   user
     time-out) Mine is set to 120 seconds, or two minutes.

     Also,   the   system  operator  must  tell  KENO,  via  it's
     configuration file, if the BBS is OPUS or not.    If  it  is
     OPUS,  KENO  will  attempt to read the file LASTUSER.BBS for
     the user's name.  If it is not OPUS, KENO will ask the  user

     for her  or his name.  This allows most (if not all) BBSs to
     run KENO!

     A  scorekeeper  program  reads  the  user's  data  file  and
     produces a file with all the user's names and money on hand.
     This file was designed to be included in a bulletin or other
     BBS readable text file.

     Want a  copy?    File  Request  KENO.ARC  from The Astro-Net
     (1:103/503.0)  and  you'll  receive  the   program,   sample
     configuration   file,  documentation,  and  the  scorekeeper
     program. Best of all, it's FREE!

                             POWER POSTING SCHOOL

     Are you REALLY SATISFIED with the impact of your USENET postings?
     Do people quail  and quiver at the thought of  your followups? Is
     your name on the lips of net.fans on seven continents?

     Or perhaps you  are NOT HAPPY with your posting  style. Do people
     ignore you? Perhaps  you are disappointed that no  one ever posts
     followups  to your  messages, or  that Mark  Ethan Smith  is more
     famous than  you. Perhaps you are  bored and like to  get lots of
     mail. If so, take heart! Here is a new service for net.wimps!

                 *** THE POWER POSTING SCHOOL ***

     Our world-flamous  instructors will  turn you into  A BEAST  OF A
     MAN. Topics will range from  pure theory (Monty Python's Argument
     Clinic)  to   practice  (assignments   reading  and   posting  in
     alt.flame, soc.singles and other hot-gas newsgroups).

     Seminars will focus on patented power-posting techniques:

     *** USE  OF REPETITION AND  CAPITALS. Suppose some clown  makes a
     mistake of  fact in his posting  (e.g., <1309@nmtsun.nmt.edu>, by
     John Shipman):

         >> The FORTRAN 77 standard  does not prohibit modification >>
         of the iteration variable inside the loop.

     Now, some WUSS might try to be polite, and reply

         I believe you have missed a critical paragraph in the
         standard (e.g., <162@amelia.nas.nasa.gov> and
         <4026@aw.sei.cmu>).

     You'll never get anywhere with this approach. People are so ready
     to hit  the `n' key these  days; you have to  get their attention
     with flashy graphics or they'll ignore you altogether. The proper
     style is: (e.g., <1328@nmtsun.nmt.edu>):

         WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG

     Politeness is for  wimps. If people have been  ignoring you, it's
     not  because you're  a twit,  but because  you don't  SCREAM LOUD
     ENOUGH (the Sam Kinison School).

     *** THE SMILEY  FACE: YOUR SHIELD AGAINST A CRUEL  WORLD. You can
     say anything you want, no matter how insulting, and get away with
     it! All you have to do is obey the proper net.etiquette. Example:

         This  is  not a  flame,  you  scumbag, slimeball  toad!  Your
         parents  were mutant  intestinal parasites!  Your face  would
         make a  pathologist puke! Vultures and  maggots would disdain
         your  carcass!   Your  romantic   preference  is   for  pets,
         livestock, organ  meats, AIDS sufferers and  rejects from Idi
         Amin's harem! :-) (No flames, please)

     *** THE  GRANDSTAND FINISH. No  one will respect you  unless your
     .signature  file  runs for  two  screens.  Special lectures  will
     cover:

       -- Drawing unrecognizable pictures  using only ASCII characters
       -- How to come up with  at least 35 different return mail paths
       -- Sources for obscure, meaningless, flashy quotations

     *** CALL TODAY. Are you ORGANISM  ENOUGH to be a net.god like Fai
     Lau? Interested applicants please  reply by posting in alt.flame.
     Please don't reply by e-mail,  as the instructors spend all their
     time reading the net and never get to the e-mail.

     SYSOP LIABILITY FOR PIRATED SOFTWARE AND OTHER ILLEGAL MATERIAL

     Jonathan D. Wallace, Esq.

     When sysops get together, electronically or in person, sooner or
     later the question of a sysop's responsibility for pirated
     software, stolen credit card codes or other illegal material
     comes up. Everyone has heard the story of Tom Tcimpidis, the
     California sysop who was criminally charged because a user left a
     telephone credit card code on his BBS, and other similar horror
     stories.

     This area of the law is in considerable turmoil. As yet, there
     have been no decided court cases involving sysops, though
     numerous civil suits and prosecutions have been resolved by
     settlements, dismissals or guilty pleas. The following,
     therefore, is not a statement of the law as it exists; it is
     rather a statement of the law as I believe it will evolve, based
     on common sense and precedents from other areas of law.

     A sysop should not be held liable for the presence of illegal
     material on his BBS unless he placed it there, encouraged its
     presence, or was negligent in allowing it to be placed there or
     to remain there.

     When does a sysop "encourage" the presence of illegal material?
     When the BBS is named "The Pirate Ship"  and the sign-on message
     says "Over 80 megs online! Upload something I don't already have
     to get access to the Hi-Access Lair".This sysop might be sued or
     criminally charged as both a copyright infringer (for making and
     distributing illegal copies of software) and as a contributory
     infringer (for abetting and promoting the illegal activity).

     When is a sysop negligent in allowing illegal material to be
     placed or to remain on the BBS? Over the next few years, the
     courts will deal with the question of when a sysop has exercised
     "due care". Sysops can protect themselves today by imposing
     standards of care on themselves that the courts will  later
     accept. A sysop who never reviews the messages or uploads on the
     BBS would certainly be negligent by any standard.  I recommend
     that sysops attempt to review messages and new uploads  on a
     daily basis; if this is burdensome, appoint some assistant
     sysops. Other measures that will help avoid accusations of
     negligence are directing uploads to a separate subdirectory,
     using utilities that detect dangerous programs such as Trojans
     and viruses, and placing bulletins and messages on the BBS
     strictly enjoining users against the upload of illegal materials.

     Most criminal cases will involve intentional behavior (the sysop
     placed the illegal material on the BBS or encouraged users to
     upload it), while civil lawsuits might involve either intentional
     or negligent behavior.

     If, despite your best efforts, you ever do find yourself
     embroiled in a legal proceeding, evidence that you run a clean
     board and that you did your best to prevent uploads of illegal

     material should go a long way in your favor.

     Here's a little utility program that's free to anyone who wants
     it...  these are (mostly) excerpts from the documentation
     for.....

     PAKIT Version 1.02 - a semi-intelligent ARCA to PAK Converter
     for use with oMMM Version 1.07 or higher.

     No warranty expressed or implied - use at your own risk!

     The purpose of this program is to allow you to create smaller
     outgoing mail archives (*.mo? files) for systems that can
     accept them, by using NoGate Consulting's PAK File Compression
     Utility (Version 1.0 or higher) with oMMM version 1.07 or
     higher (it will probably work with earlier versions as well,
     but you should upgrade anyway!).  Those who use oMMM may be
     aware that oMMM calls ARCA for file compression purposes.  This
     program intercepts the call to ARCA, translates it to a format
     that PAK can understand, and then hands it over to PAK.
     Starting with version 1.01 of PAKIT, you may also optionally
     specify that PKWARE's PKARC or PKPAK program is to be called
     when creating "Crunched" or "Squashed" mail archives.  While
     this program is specifically designed for use with oMMM, it MAY
     also work with other packers that call ARCA using the "/D"
     parameter at the end of the invocation line.

     If you use this program and PAK without a PAKIT.CTL file, the
     resulting mail archive files should be no different than if you
     had just used ARCA only (obviously, there's no real advantage
     in doing that, but you can do it if you want to).  The major
     advantage in using this program is that you can use a control
     file called PAKIT.CTL, which will allow you to specify which of
     PAK's three possible compression levels will be used when
     packing mail to any given node.  Thus, if you KNOW that a
     particular node is using PKWARE's PKXARC (or PKUNPAK) program
     to de-archive mail packets, you can create mail packets using
     "Squashing", which will make smaller packets and possibly save
     you some transmission time.  If you regularly communicate with
     a node that uses PAK to unpack mail, you can create mail
     bundles using "Crushing" and save even more disk space and
     transmission time.  These options should only be used with
     nodes with which you communicate regularly, and know what
     program is being used to uncompress mail packets.

     The current version of PAKIT renames individual .PKT files
     prior to placing them in the mail archive, in order to assure
     that older files are always placed before newer ones in the
     archive.  This is done to overcome a difference in operation
     between ARCA and PKARC/PKPAK/PAK10.  ARCA always added packets
     to the END of an existing archive, but the newer programs do us
     the favor(?) of inserting new files into an existing archive in
     alphabetical order.  oMMM creates packets using a naming
     sequence that restarts every day, thus packets created just
     after midnight would be stored in the archive BEFORE packets
     FidoNews 6-06                Page 10                   6 Feb 1989


     created on the previous day (when one of the newer archivers is
     used).  The result is that replies to messages are sometimes
     stored prior to the original messages when the destination
     system unpacks the mail!  PAKIT attempts to overcome this
     problem by renaming the packets using a naming sequence that
     restarts at the beginning of every year, rather than every day.
     Thus, it is only possible to create out-of-order mail packets
     at the beginning of January.  The packet names used contain
     only the hexadecimal digits 0-9 and A-F, and are always eight
     characters long (not counting the .PKT extension).  As far as I
     can determine, this will not cause any problem for any existing
     mail unpacker, but please let me know if you discover
     otherwise.

     Version 1.02 of PAKIT has just been released, and is compatible
     with the new release of oMMM (1.30).  Older versions of PAKIT
     will most likely not work properly with the new version of
     oMMM.  The most recent copy of PAKIT should be file requestable
     from Fidonet node 1:154/7 (aka LCRnet node 77:1011/7 or NetWork
     node 8:70/7), under the filename PAKIT*.ARC.  This is a
     mail-only node located in Milwaukee, and is PC Pursuitable.  If
     you are located in a PC Pursuitable city and for some reason
     can't make a file request work, send me a message and I'll try
     file attaching it to you.  By the way, there's no copyright
     notice or request for payment (or anything else) anywhere in
     PAKIT.  It's a gift to anyone who wants it, pure and simple!

     If you find an archiving program that creates archives that are
     even smaller than "Crushed" files (particularly if it's truly
     public domain, or at least free to non-commercial users),
     please send a copy of the program to me and I will at least
     consider making a version of this program that will use it.
     Also, if the Fidonet (or any "other" net) nodelist is ever
     modified to include a "compression level" flag for mail
     archives, I will consider rewriting this program to look
     directly to the nodelist for compression level information.

     Welcome to:

      THE SOCIETY FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS

     By: Al Arango, 1:107/523, 7:520/523

     As many of you know, there is a great misconception about the
     public bulletin board community.  Most people have gotten a very
     nasty impression of computer telecommunicators, due to the bad
     press that we receive.  It seems that only the bad points of our
     community are reported.  Unless a person is directly involved
     with BBS'ing, they have no idea of the good points of public
     access telecommunications.

     Well, several NY-NJ area System Operators (SYSOPS) have joined
     together to try and combat this bad press and provide high
     ethical standards. Together, we have formed the Society for the
     Advancement of Computer Communications.

     The purposes of S.A.C.C. are to:

     Promote the common interests of the members;

     Promote high ethical standards among sysops and users of bulletin
     board systems;

     Encourage high standards of competence and conduct, promoting
     professionalism among its members through educational programs
     and discussion of common  business, legal and technical problems;

     Increase awareness among the general public, and the governmental
     and business communities, Of the nature of a sysop's role and the
     responsibilities of sysops to their users and to the general
     public;

     Provide  various  services  and benefits  to members.

     Our effort is to educate the public about the BBS community and
     to try to prevent any more improper ideas from forming in the
     minds of the media and the general public.  We will attempt to
     provide many different members of the media with information
     about BBS's, and try to inform them of the good points of
     telecommunications.  If we can provide this good information and
     try to stop any illicit activities on BBS systems, then we will
     succeed in improving the entire electronic community.

     Another reason for forming S.A.C.C. is this : there are certain
     types of people that get no greater joy than 'breaking the rules'
     of a BBS system. Until now, a person such as this would raise
     havoc on one system, and then  simply move on to another system
     to continue his mischief.  A Sysop had no  recourse other than to
     ban the user from his system.  That is going to  change. Should a
     user intentionally cause problems on a S.A.C.C. Member Board
     (whether they use profane language, upload pirated software, or
     break any  local BBS rules), that user will be reported to all
     members of S.A.C.C. so  that action can be taken against said
     FidoNews 6-06                Page 12                   6 Feb 1989


     user on as many systems as possible.   We feel that this will
     keep many people from causing problems on BBS systems, and this
     will once again improve the electronic community.

     An added benefit for the users of BBS systems is this: a Sysop's
     forum such as S.A.C.C. can serve as a place to discuss
     improvements among ALL BBS systems in the area. S.A.C.C.  can
     serve as a 'central nervous system' for all computer users.  A
     'global users group', if you will.  With an organization such as
     S.A.C.C., it will be easier to coordinate inter-BBS activities
     such as gatherings or any other idea that a Sysop or a user comes
     up with.

     Any legitimate bulletin board system is may join S.A.C.C.
     Membership is open to any individual or organization that  runs a
     networked or  potentially networked BBS or  EMAIL  system which
     in whole or in part  is run  for the public good  or  for  the
     benefit  of the other members. Membership is available regardless
     of race, creed, sex, national origin, or physical disability. We
     wish to provide our services to all Sysops and wish to pass our
     benefits on to ALL of the users of BBS systems.

     SYSOP SUES USER WHO ALLEGEDLY UPLOADED TROJAN PROGRAM

     by Jonathan D. Wallace, Esq. 107/801

     Bill  Christison,  sysop  of  a bulletin  board  system
     called the Santa Fe Message,  filed suit in August in New  Mexico
     federal  court  against a user he believed had uploaded a  trojan
     horse program to his BBS.

     The program,  which purported to compile statistics  on
     BBS  usage,  erased  the operating system from Christison's  hard
     disk and damaged the file allocation table when he ran it.

     With the aid of the telephone company,  Christison  was
     able  to  identify  the  user (who had called  his  BBS  under  a
     pseudonym as Michael Dagg, also of New Mexico.)

     Christison's  law  suit is the  second  case  involving
     bulletin board systems to have been brought under the Electronic
     Communications Privacy Act of 1986  (ECPA).

     Under the ECPA,  it is a federal crime to access stored
     electronic  communications  without authorization and  to  alter,
     obtain  or  prevent  access  to  such  communications.  Penalties
     include   imprisonment  of  up  to  one  year  and  fines  up  to
     $250,000.00.  The  statute also provides for private civil  suits
     such as Christison's.

     As of October 7th, Dagg had not yet hired an attorney  or
     responded to the complaint,  according to Christison's  attorney,
     Ann Yalman.

     The ECPA potentially provides a potent tool for sysops who wish
     to defend themselves against malicious users. It is a two-edged
     sword, however: the first case brought under the ECPA involving
     bulletin board systems was Thompson v. Predaina, in which a user
     sued a sysop who allegedly made private files public without
     permission.

     --- Jonathan D. Wallace, Esq., an attorney in private practice in
     New York City, is editor of The Computer Law Letter, a  bimonthly
     newsletter, and author of SYSLAW: The Sysop's Legal Manual. He

     Ken McVay, SysOp
     The Old Frog's Almanac (153/20)
     Nanaimo, British Columbia

     In  my first column, I discussed the origins of The Almanac,  and
     provided  a representative list of the topical  files  available.
     This  week,  I'll  show you how it's  all  accomplished.  (Anyone
     wishing  to  set  such a system up  is  welcome  to  bark-request
     ALMANAC.PAK and EGREP100.ARC, 24-hours a day, via HST)

     Briefly, here's how it all works from my SEAdog batch file:

     First,  since Murphy rules supreme, I set it up so I  could  turn
     the  whole extraction system off, just in case I was going to  be
     away  for more than a day or two, by adding "SET  ALMANAC=ON"  at
     the  top  of  the  batch file. The  extraction  routines  are  an
     integral  part  of my daily INBOUND routine, and  are  run  after
     ConfMail's IMPORT and RENUM functions are completed.

     :INBOUND
             <process echomail first, look after nodediff's etc.>

             if %ALMANAC% == OFF goto CLEANUP

     First,  I  check  each message directory  for  the  existence  of
     100.MSG, just to make sure Sirius won't clobber all the mail.  If
     100.MSG  is there, the appropriate Sirius script is executed  for
     that message area.

     E:
     cd\OPUS
             if EXIST G:\M22\100.msg Sirius HDCONF
             .... ....

     Here's a portion of the file HDCONF.SIR:

     ;------------------------HDCONF.SIR (Sirius V0.50)--------------
     ;
     ;       This script scans the HDCONF area and extracts specific
     ;       topical messages as defined by "(Define ('T' ..." line.

     After  running  through all the required Sirius scripts,  we  are

     me about 10-12% over other available utilities>

     I use the ancient but still pristine FidoUtil to log all of  this
     activity,  so  I  can  keep track of  how  much  system  time  is
     required.  At the present time, running on an Everex Step  286/16
     and  MiniScribe 6128/Perstor 180, it takes about 12 minutes  from
     beginning to end. The whole process raises absolute hob with  the
     drives, and I don't recommend it if you are running an XT :-)   -
     Running VOPT is a must after everything else is completed!

     It  still  takes  a long time to skim through  message  areas  to
     FidoNews 6-06                Page 18                   6 Feb 1989


     clobber  the  floobydust, one-liners, etc., but I  have  received
     help  from  several users who, via Opus  barricaded  areas,  edit
     specific areas and do some of the work for me. In time, I hope to
     have  enough editors on the job to cover all the areas  available
     so I won't have to do it.

     The  files  created  in  this manner can  be  a  rich  source  of
     technical  and social data, and can cover virtually any area  and
     any subject available on your system. The "proof of the puddin' "
     in  my  case  is clear - users who used  to  ignore  the  Almanac
     topical extracts now download them regularly, and I receive a lot
     of positive comments and requests for more specific topicals from
     areas which aren't extracted yet.

     I   hope  to  enlist  additional  help  from   sysops   receiving
     conferences which are unavailable to me, and perhaps establish an
     "Almanac  Network"  which  will exchange topicals  on  a  regular
     basis.  I would recommend using floppies to do this, however,  as
     the  files  quickly  eat up drive space, and  would  be  far  too
     expensive  to  swap  via  modem, high speed  or  not.  My  system
     presently has over 12 megs of extracts available, and I would  be
     happy to send them to anyone who sends me disks containing  other
     files  in exchange, particularly business-oriented utilities  and
     applications. Anyone wishing my address is invited to contact  me
     netmail, or call me voice at 604-758-4137.

     From: MARK BORNSTEIN Y
     Subj: 2 CENTS

     Saw  your  words  in  Fido  news  and wanted to put in my 2 cents
     worth. One  would get  the feeling  from reading  your words that
     you  are  in  the  pay  of  sea  and want all to do some good old
     fashion 'book burning.' Now  I don't  much care  for politics nor
     politicians, for  I hold  with Mencken  that "the only difference
     between a  good politician  and a  bad one  is that  the good one
     KNOWS just  how much  to steal!" Now I know very little about the
     controversy , nor PC-World, nor do I care  to. However,  it seems
     to me  that you are guilty of the same thing that you accuse Judy
     Getts of. You  do  an  injustice  both  to  yourself  and  to the
     prestige  of  Fidonews  by  your  words. If anything your actions
     will probably have the reverse  effect  you  so  ardently desire.
     i.e. From  the few  I have  spoken to about this, it would appear
     that you have evoked no small  measure  of  sympathy  for  PK. It
     would appear  that the average user, rightly or wrongly, does not
     care about the politics of this issue. They  seem to  want, as do
     I, rightly  or wrongly,  the fastest and best compress utility of
     all. In the  final  analysis  neither  your  words  or  mine will
     determine the outcome. Perhaps a more appropriate medium for your
     message would be the FLAME ECHO. It is wonderful for  letting off
     steam and  would not appear as if you were using your position to
     advance goals seen as personal rather  than for  the good  of the
     network. I  will not  mind at  all if this is printed in the next
     issue of Fidonews as a letter to the editor. In fact please do. I
     enjoy seeing my name in print.

     Mark,

     You seem to have to have one misconception about FidoNews, that I
     write everything that's printed. FidoNews is  made up  of article
     submissions from  the people  in FidoNet,  both sysops and users.
     The article in question was sent in by one of  the sysops  in Net
     107, I myself am in Net 157.

     As far  as the  SEA vs.  PKWare lawsuit,  there have been quite a
     few articles on this subject printed in FidoNews. However, if you
     have little  interest in  it or knowledge about it and don't want
     to learn enough to make your own EDUCATED decisions on it... Well
     then I feel sorry for you. Apathy is not an answer. Apathy is one
     of the causes of much of  FidoNet's problems  these days.  Do you
     vote for  the candidate for whom you've seen the most promotional
     material? Do you buy a product because it  has the  nicest ads on
     TV? I  hope not,  but this  is what you're telling me. It is this
     same sort of attitude  that has  sysops joining  FidoNet just for
     echomail. These individuals have never read a policy document and
     FidoNews 6-06                Page 20                   6 Feb 1989


     are only in it for  a  free  lunch  (the  free  lunch  being free
     echomail). Their  attitude is one of "let me do everything my way
     or else I'm going to scream and pout, I don't  care what everyone
     else is  doing or why, I just know I'm going to keep doing things
     my way." This isn't the principles  that made  FidoNet strong, it
     is one  that seeks  to destroy something special. FidoNet was put
     together  by  people  who  learned  and  made  educated decisions
     together.  I  once  received  a  message  from  a  sysop  who was
     wondering what  all  these  FNEWS*.ARC  files  were  that  he was
     receiving every  week and  did he  need a  special program to use
     them. While this is  an  extreme,  it  shows  that  in  some ways
     FidoNet has grown to quickly.

     As far  as what the user's want. I know that right and wrong make
     a difference to me. While it may not bother some  people, I still
     have to  look at  myself every  morning in  the mirror. Right and
     wrong are important. While many may  not be  happy with  what the
     courts have  decided, all of us have to live with their decision.
     If we don't agree, then their are established methods of changing
     those rulings.  I've heard a lot on this issue, but I don't claim
     to have all the facts. I  understand that  they are  available to
     anyone  who  wants  them  by  contacting the state of Wisconsin's
     judicial system. Supposedly there are several nice thick books of
     the   court   proceedings,   including  all  the  depositions.  I
     understand obtaining a copy  isn't  cheap,  but  then  truth (and
     anything worth having) isn't always cheap or free (in fact, those
     things worth having are almost never cheap or free).

     <FidoNews Editor's hat off>

     Personally, I would have preferred that events hadn't happened as
     they did.  However, with  all the information I've seen and heard
     on the issue (and while it's far from complete, it quite a bit) I
     have to support SEA. I don't care for the way things went (having
     to go to court and all), but personally I will stand behind Thom.
     If you  feel that  PKWare and Phil Katz have gotten the short end
     of it, please write an article for FidoNews  giving the  facts on
     why. Just  please try and keep it factual. Also, try to keep away
     from confusing the issue with the relative speed of the products.
     That wasn't  the issue.  The real issue was and still is "Did SEA
     have a right to  bring  PKWare  to  court."  Regardless  of which
     product who happen to like, if Phil was wrong (and I'm not saying
     he was) then you've got to accept it. Please note  that I  am not
     judging either of these two parties. Even if I had all the facts,
     I'm not sure if I could judge these fine people. I know that from
     what I've heard, I do have to support SEA.

     <Editor's hat back on>

     I  have  to  disagree  with  you  on either of our words making a
     difference. I firmly believe that one man (or  woman) CAN  make a
     difference. Where  would we  be today without Tom Jennings? Would
     something like  FidoNet  ever  have  developed?  Probably  not as
     quickly,  and  possibly  never.  How about Jeff Rush? FidoNet was
     around for several years before he came up with using  netmail to
     share  a  message  base.  Outside of the FidoNet community, where
     FidoNews 6-06                Page 21                   6 Feb 1989


     would the world be today without a John F. Kennedy ("Ask not what
     your  country  can  do  for  you,  but  what  can you do for your
     country"), a Douglas MacArthur  (no  favorite  quotes),  a Ronald
     Reagan  ("We  the  people  give  government these rights" I first
     heard this from  him  when  he  stopped  at  Bowling  Green State
     University  in  Ohio  during  the  '84  campaign in response to a
     question asked him by my roommate), and the list goes on. History
     is filled  with examples of how one person did make a difference.
     A line out  of  one  of  my  favorite  movies  is  "Words  can be
     wonderful" (2  months of  having FidoNews  delivered to a node of
     your choice within the US and Canada to the first  person who can
     name the movie and the character who said it).

     Anyway, this  has gone on far longer than I anticipated. FidoNews
     prints almost anything it receives that matches specs. One person
     doesn't control  it or  write everything that appears in it. As I
     have often said "FidoNews is YOUR newsletter." The recent request
     on  how  you'd  like  to  see  FidoNews  changed  by Rick Siegel,
     chairman  of  the  IFNA  Publications  Committee  shows  that the
     majority still  want it  to be  run as  it has  for the past five
     years and baring very  unusual circumstances,  that's the  way it
     going to stay. If FidoNet wants changes, the can inform both Rick
     and their IFNA rep. and if the majority  decides on  a change, it
     will be done. Until then, we get it...we print it.

     ----------------------------------------
     Late follow-up to Mark's initial letter

     It  appears  on  closer  reading  that  you may not have been the
     author of the message concerning sea/PK  Getts  et  al.  If  so I
     apologize for  contributing the   authorship  to you. However, as
     editor of Fidonews, the  responsibility for  its   being included
     still remains  yours. One  of the  things about  this article is
     that there is no clear indication of just who it was that entered
     the  message.  This  becomes  more  clear  after  re-reading  its
     contents. Because of the stylistic setting of page  numbers it is
     difficult to  determine if  it is editorial comment or written by
     the one (Zachary I think) who wrote the article following. At any
     rate, if you did not write it I again apologize profusely and ask
     that if you    do  print  my  earlier  message,  that  you please
     include this  apology with it.   Thanx.
              ...mark

     ----------------------------------------

     It is never hard to tell what section you're reading in FidoNews.
     The editorials  start with  a header  marking them as editorials.
     The articles, by a divider bar saying articles. I agree that I am
     responsible for  it being  printed. To  date, I have never had to
     censor anything for FidoNews. Everything that's  come in matching
     specs has been printed with no delay. While TJ's article of a few
     months back came close to being censored because of the language,
     I  let  it  go  out  because I felt the information on California
     FidoNews 6-06                Page 22                   6 Feb 1989


     propositions was very important and that if nothing else everyone
     in FidoNet  owes him  a big  thank you for starting everything in
     the first place. Only the combination of those two items let that
     article be printed.

     As far  as authorship, I've always included my name at the bottom
     of anything I've had  printed in  FidoNews. Usually  with several
     addresses as  well (FidoNet,  Usenet, US  Mail). The problem with
     authorship on submissions is that by the time  I get  it here, it
     too late  to determine  who wrote it. All I've got is a log entry
     indicating calls received.

     What happens if an  article  doesn't  match  the  specs  given in
     several editorials  last year  and the ARTSPEC.DOC file mentioned
     at the top of every edition? It tends to sit around until  I have
     a slow  week. Then  I fix  several of  them so that MakeNews will
     accept them. Easiest  solution  to  this  is  to  make  sure your
     article matches  specs, not hope that I'll fix any problems. Yes,
     I will eventually fix the errors but it may sit around here for a
     long time.

     Here's  a  brief  summary  of  those specs for those who might be
     interested. Left justify your text, MakeNews puts in  the leading
     spaces you  see on  every line. Don't go beyond 65 characters per
     line. Keep everything within the ASCII characters space and tilde
     (decimal 32  through decimal  127). The file extension determines
     where it goes. Use ART  for  an  article,  COL  for  a  column or
     series, or LET for a letter to the editor (there are more but I'm
     summarizing here). If  the  first  line  starts  with  an asterix
     ("*"), then  that line  is printed  in the  table of contents and
     does not appear in the text of the  article. Proof  read your own
     article as  a lot  of people  are going  to be reading it. If you
     send it in with  misspellings and  poor grammar,  I assume that's
     how you want it. FidoNews is mostly an automated process, ideally
     if I died tomorrow  everything would  still get  out until  a new
     editor  was  found.  FidoNet  is  a  very diverse group, FidoNews
     allows for something to interest everyone.
