Editorial: Here comes trouble

by Tom Jennings (1:1/1)

Well, it's Monday morning. Upon checking my mail, the first thing I
see is that somehow my machine has delivered last week's newsletter
disguised as this weeks. THen when I go to look, I find I have all of
this week's articles (except one, see below) and no editorial. And
the file that contains the issue number (9-31 in this case) is wrong.
Files I know were there that I was saving for next week are also gone.

This is all very puzzling, as I not only watched it make the right
newsletter, I always look at the first few pages (though I certainly
could have missed the wrong issue number). Then I watched it launch
everything. This AM also I noticed my LAN node seems to have forgotten
how to talk to the BBS node. Maybe I can blame NOVELL NETWARE LITE. I
just switched text editors, from MATE to FREEMACS. I wonder if this
has anything to do with it. I hope not!

Well a day late, but what else is new.

                        * * * * *

Now, what was I saying?

Oh yes. I received in the email this past week two unusual things.
One a flame so absurd and ridiculuous that at first I thought it was
a joke. It wasn't. I also received an incredibly bizarre response to
a recent editorial that had me howling with laughter. I am certain it
was not funny to the author.

I don't make fun of people, period. But these two are such gems that I
will edit them into obscurity, including grammar, to protect the
authors. They are that good. (They received personal replies, believe me.)

So I decided -- the next FidoNews, 9-32, will be the FIDONET IS FUNNY
issue. A one-time HUMOR issue (some will argue that it is always
funny; kick them out of the net now). I will hold off on running my
amusements so that you can send me yours.

Humor relevant to FidoNet would be nice but maybe too much to ask for.
Cynical incisive smart(ass) humor is generally better received than
obscenities, or jokes at someones expense, such as bigot jokes, which
I will not run. Let's take a chance and see what we get. I'll dig out
some of the few decent computer-related jokes and aphorisms I've
collected in the last ten years (maybe a page's worth).

                     * * * * *

A TERRIBLE THING HAS HAPPENED --

I lost one article in this odd accident. I received a "funny"
article, poking fun at FidoNet practices. To tell the truth, I hate
computer jokes. They are amongst the stupidest and unfunniest. But
this was actually funny... and might even Annoy someone.

So I set it aside (renamed it) and mentioned it in the (now lost)
editorial. It's gone! And I don't even know the authors name!

Please, please, send me your article again. It won't be the same
without it.

        FidoCon '92         "Gateway Networking"
        September 4-6          Summit Hotel
        Dallas, Texas

FidoCon '92 is only a month away.  If you get your registration form
mailed before the end of the month, you'll save $10 over the late
registration price.  Registrations received after August 10th may be
subject to an additional late charge imposed by the Summit hotel.

The FIDOCON92 conference is now on the FidoNet echomail backbone.  If
it's not available in your area, ask your REC about it.

We have reserved one of our two large conference rooms for vendor
displays, and are still actively soliciting vendors to show their
wares, as well as provide some of our door prizes.

The schedule is getting firmed up.  We hope to have discussions by the
major phone service providers about new technology, Caller*ID, and how
these changes relate to our use of the phone system. We're working on
getting the major modem vendors in attendance, where they can show
their new stuff, as well as discuss the V.32, V.42, and new V.fast
standards.  There will be discussions about echomail cost sharing, as
well as talks on the operation of some of the zone and network
gateways.  And we should have lots of demonstrations of network
software, OS/2 V2.0, Windows/NT, etc.

Vendor space is available for $200 for a 10'x10' area for both days.
Hospitality suites are also available for $100 plus $49 for each of up
to three attached sleeping rooms.  These are per night charges.  For
more information, file request ADVERTIS.TXT from 1/92.

If you've got an idea for a discussion session, or know of a vendor
that might be interested in attending, let us hear from you as soon as
possible.

Oh, and don't forget to bring your swimming suit for the net -vs- net
water volleyball tournament!

By Joe Jared of 1:125/1212 (Formerly 103/200)
Recently with the assistance of 102/138 I have obtained almost all of
the Fidonews articles to date.  Part of this was out of boredom, but
there's also a need to keep the history of Fidonet alive, and the best
historical document of Fidonet I've seen to date is Fidonews itself.
Sure there's plenty of ranting and raving, and most of the motivators in
fidonet's growth have flown the coop, but by reading these articles, one
can see how as the net grew, growing pains and would be power mongers
would try to push the will of the net onto lesser beings, and how
fidonet has grown into the gigantic political and technical nightmare
that it is.  Anyway, enough rambling.  For request purposes, the
articles prior to 1992 are available by file request using the following
numbering sequence or by name if you want specific files.

FNews_## where ## is the year's worth of fidonews.  There are a few
stray areas that I'm looking for to complete the set, and if anyone has
the missing pieces or an explaination as to the gaps, either would be
appreciated.

Year 1:  This is all I have. FNEWS_84.ARJ

--- MORE USELESS BUREAUCRATS? WHAT FOR?! ---


Just got back to California after a 5-week-long absence. During the
time, I had the opportunity to attend two excellent FidoNet events:
MainzCon '92 in Munich, Germany, and CataCom/EuroCon '92 in Lleida,
Spain. Both events deserve a separate review on FidoNews that I
promise to write very soon. In the meantime, let me talk about
something more urgent:

FidoNews 9-31                  Page 8                       3 Aug 1992


After reading the FidoNewses I missed, I got to the last two where
I read with revulsion the last of the unneeded and indeed
despicable proposals to expand the most useless of the bureaucratic
layers of the administration of the most undemocratic of the zones,
my own, Zone 1.

My shock not only derived from the proposal, but from WHOM was
writing about it: Tom Jennings. If my memory is still clear, it was
none other than Tom Jennings who said that the region coordinators
were a fuck-up of Policy4 with absolutely no technical value. At
the time, I agreed with reservations, but one thing that has always
been pretty clear to me is that nowhere but in zones 1 and 3 are
the RCs more useless and have less technical utility.

In the rest of the zones (that is, all but Zones 1 and 3), that
contain several different countries, a region represents a country.
Since there are radical differences from country to country in
terms of communication costs, usually linguistic differences, and
many times political problems that FidoNet cannot simply overcome,
the structure one_region_one_country is effective and useful. Most
regions outside Zones 1 and 3 have In/Out gates that route at the
regional level (i.e. REGION/999 nodes in Zone 2), but here in Zone
1, they don't even serve for that.

Indeed, over here, calling outside one's state is usually cheaper
than within the state, and regions have no technical utility
whatsoever. What difference does it makes if one is in California
and belongs to region 10, and in Oregon and belongs to region 17?
There is no reason to have regions in Zone 1, other than dividing
a bit the collection of nodelist segments from the nets... and that
could be arranged in a way-less-painful manner.

I was happy to see that in Zone 2, from where I just returned, all
the region coordinators are elected by the sysops in their
regions... What about here? Nothing. At least in my region (the
same as TJ's), there are no elections for nothing. So what positive
thing would derive from simply having a larger structure of region
DICTATORS? What difference does it make? Why are regions too big
and for what are they too big? Why do region coordinators exist
here in the first place?

Geez, it is real hard for me to hide my disappointment, once again,
with the maneuvers that are attempted that do no good to us,
FidoNet sysops. I'm tired of the political bullshit and this is
political bullshit. I'm more disappointed even, to see Tom Jennings
supporting this... Maybe himself, Josh, and Vince can explain how
FidoNet would benefit from having more regions in Zone 1? What
about the new region coordinators? Will they add to the general
self-appointed oligarchy that administrates this zone or do they
present us with a democratic alternative, at last?

/* Note from Tom Jennings:

Thom Henderson pointed out that this "editorializing on the fly" can
be very rude, by getting in "the last word". But that's not my goal
here, and besides, it mentions me by name, so...

Basically Pablo -- there is not a conspiracy under every rock. I
would like to see RCs become what they were intended to be --
*exactly* equivelant to NCs, no more, no less. To do all of the
functions an NC does *except* route incoming netmail. That was all I
ever intended.

In fact however no one *I* know is in a position to push some magic
button and make them all go away.

In fact also, as Dick Gladden points out, the region encompassing El
Paso TX (I simply don't remember the number) is actually over 1300
nodes, not "1000" like I guessed.

So acknowledging the actual, factual existence of RCs, the more the
merrier. At the least it would be dilution of existing power from a
handful to "many". Not quite the same as, or as desirable as, going
from a handful to "lots!" ie. each net a sovereign entity as intended.

Just because I don't spout revolutionary rhetoric at every point
doesn't mean I have "sold out to the enemy". The world is not black
and white, and I won't be force-fit into anyone's "camp" no matter
how righteous... */

Regarding teenagers in FidoNet
By: Andrew Gray @ 1:231/590 on July 20th 1992

  FidoNet is a wonderful network full of informational echos,
well-organized (some might disagree with that one), and well thought
out. All one has to do is either become a point off a node or become a
node.  Supposedly.  Recently, an article has been published about
troubles someone was having joining FidoNet because he owns a
non-standard (read non-IBM) computer.  Now I can understand this, for
I own an Amiga, and the echos I pull are a good 300K compressed a day
from FidoNet alone (not to mention the UseNet gateway).  But as the
echos I wanted were already being pulled by the hub (we have a couple
other nodes here in Net 231 who also pull them) there was no problem.

  But, has any one given a thought to the problem of being
"discriminated" on their age?  Here it is not that big of a problem,
but I have heard tales of teenagers not being able to get a node
number because of their age and the other nodes afraid they will
"disrupt" their net.  I'm personally a teenage SysOp and had no
troubles whatsoever.  But in someplaces the stereotypes placed on us
are incredible.  Some people seem to think SysOp, teenager and FidoNet
do not go together.  Some people think that all we teenagers are going
to do is be unruly, rude, and not follow (or care) about the rules.
Some people think the only reason we have a BBS is so we can make our
own rules.  All the adults here in FidoNet including the ones I talk
FidoNews 9-31                  Page 10                      3 Aug 1992


to frequently have no problem what-so-ever with me being a teenager,
but, referring back to my friend, he was trying to get help setting up
a BBS program and got absolutely no response, even though five sysops
in the net were running it, and he is certain the message went out.
He finally figured it out on his own a couple weeks later.

  So what am I getting at?  Well, there are people in FidoNet who
think IBMs should be the only computers allowed, there are people who
want the rules more strict or more loose, and then there are those who
want an "adults-only" sign put on all of it.  I have seen this type of
thinking before on a BBS, although not in FidoNet, for I was home sick
one day and was calling a BBS and generally received comments like
"Why don't you go to school were you belong" and other things that
should not be repeated.

  On the other hand there are people who have special echos set up for
teens to talk, etc.  The first one that comes to mind is a local-only
echo called ITEEN (Indiana Teens), but also the other network
YouthNet.  These are the type of things that help us teenagers talk
about the things we like to talk about without "disrupting" the
others.

  There are boards who don't let teenagers on because of adult
material, and other things that they can't let us at because of laws.
But there are those that just ban us before we can say a word in our
defense.  Now, true, the SysOps can restrict users on any basis, BBSes
are considered private clubs, and I'm not suggesting we take out that
right, but we do deserve to be able to go through the same protocol as
someone else in FidoNet by being able to join and then being kicked
out if there is a problem.  Not just be stereotyped "Oh (s)he's a
teenager, (s)he will just cause trouble.".

  Basically what I'm saying is that not all teenagers are devils.  We
want to learn, and be able to share our thoughts.  FidoNet is a good
way for us to do this, but we keep running to these stereotypes.  We
are the future generation.  Don't we deserve to be able to freely use
FidoNet subject to your same laws?  Are we so different that we must
be forbidden from Fido?

Tornado's are enough to wreck your day

Two weeks ago today, Kendallville Indiana was hit by a small tornado.
It formed just over the west edge of town and procedure to damage
downtown Kendallville, lots and lots of trees east of downtown, the
town's bowling alley and the local Wal-Mart, Scott's foods and the
pet store.  Then it continued into a new housing development and
damaged about 25 to 30 houses.   A house about a mile south of the
BBS lost about half of its structure.  There was the county fair going
on at the time and the tornado missed causing lots of injuries there
by only a few hundred yards.  There were no fatalities (except for
businesses that are defunct) and no serious injuries.

FidoNews 9-31                  Page 11                      3 Aug 1992


I was downtown at the time the tornado hit.  There was no warning
because the tornado did not show up on radar.  (I think the reason
it hit was that I was talking to the owner of a mobile home park
about moving into a mobile home. :-)  There was a loud bang! and the
one door flew open from the air pressure change and had it's return
mechanism broken.  Since our building was the tallest in Kendallville
(a generous three stories) we were lucky that the next block north
took most of the damage.  The emergency procedures were not impressive
because it took a long time to find the keys to the basement, flash
lights, and to evacuate second and third floor.  By the time everyone
was safe, there wasn't any more danger.

The BBS lost its power for about 3 hours and its clock got reset.
Other than that, there wasn't any damage to the BBS.  The phones were
working (sortof) immediately.  After reading all the talk of damage to
computers from lightning in TECH, I'm glad to report that tornadoes
are not a threat to computers.  (Mine was in the basement, thank you!)

To commemorate the event, my Windows computer now uses a "Tornadoes"
screen saver.

                                SEAmail 1.10
                                 Revision G
                                09 July 1992

Revision G to SEAmail version 1.10 has been released, and incorporates the
following changes:

  * A bug was fixed that caused delivered processes to interfere with file
    requests in the same session.

  * KITTEN now keeps track of how many messages a caller reads or enters.
    This information can be viewed in the REVIEW command, and is accessible
    via the following system macros:

                        Total          Today
                        =====          =====
    Messages read       %MSGSREAD%     %MSGSREADTDY%
    Messages written    %MSGSWROTE%    %MSGSWROTETDY%

  * MAIL now prohibits zero-level users from adding echomail or supergroup
    folders, or from using crash priority or requesting return receipts.

  * The F10 "<R>ead - <S>elect message" display in MAIL now highlights the
    subject text of any message that is marked crash priority.

FidoNews 9-31                  Page 12                      3 Aug 1992


  * RTS was not being properly managed in some situations.  This should now
    be fixed.

  * The file transfer status box in DIAL and KITTEN now has a somewhat more
    informative title.

  * It was detected that the WAZOO session handler was not sending an extra
    TSYNC when processing a ".REQ" file during a DietIFNA session where no
    mail was being picked up.  This has been fixed.

  * The TELL program was always routing as per window S, regardless of what
    routing window is in force at the moment.  This has been fixed.

  * Two new routing directives, DEFAULT and MATCH, have been added.  See
    the updated ROUTE.DOC for details.

  * A bug was discovered that could cause GRPIN to hang under certain
    circumstances when importing messages into an echomail folder.  This
    has now been fixed.


Those with SEAmail 1.10 revision F for MS-DOS can upgrade to revision G by
going to their SEAmail directory and giving the command:

    upgrade sm110g

Those with the OS/2 version should give the command:

    upgrade sm110gp

Hello World !

My name is Patrick Dobeson, I'm the Sysop of STigma BBS (2:341/15 y
/13) since 25 December 1990.

I think FidoNet is an extraordinary way to find/give information, to
make friends or just to have some fun ! During the last 18 months,
I've made a lot of friends... really good friends. We share some
common interests, help each other to find a way to solve a problem,
to find a bargain, to make that little utility, to organize a
dinner, to meet each other at a local pub, to give a message from a
distant friend, and so and so ....

Day by day we are knowing better, perhaps better than usual... Oh yes
! FidoNet is great for all these things and more.. just as the real
world... but slightly different.

Through echo or net mail you have more time to think, to put the right
words to say the right things. You are closer to other person's
thoughts.

Why I'm saying this... well... er... um... I will marry a point of my
system next Saturday (11th of July) =:-)

She (Ana Maria Beirao) is a friend's sister. Ana Maria was a point in
his brother's node. We write each other a lot of messages by echo
mail... then by net mail.

One day the amount of net mail was so "enormous" that she ask me a
point number. :-) (2:341/15.69) ;-)

Through these mail I could know Ana Maria a lot, how she thinks about
this or that, I had the oportunity to "dive" into her intimity more
than face-to-face.

One day I had the oportunity to travel to her city (700 Kms apart) and
Cupid do the rest =;-)

She was exactly as I had "seen" her by net mail...

Next Saturday we will marry =:-) (Glups !) ;-) A lot of FidoNet users
will come to the wedding.... a lot of friends made with the help of
Fido..... Great !

The Science & Technology Echo Is On The Backbone
David Bloomberg, 1:233/12

"Science is best defined as a careful, disciplined, logical search for
knowledge about any and all aspects of the universe, obtained by
examination of the best available evidence and always subject to
correction and improvement upon discovery of better evidence." -- James
Randi

This definition probably best describes the thoughts and ideals of the
moderators of the SCI&TECH echo.

Some other so-called "science" echos have been "invaded" by psuedo-
science and religion posing as science. Those who are actually
interested in discussing the amazing changes in science and technology
that are occurring all around us are being relegated to the background
in those echos. It seems there are more messages about transcendental
meditation and religion than any actual SCIENCE!

FidoNews 9-31                  Page 14                      3 Aug 1992


Well, we have a solution. It's the SCI&TECH echo.

You may recall an article about SCI&TECH here in the FidoNews a few
months ago. Since then, we have become a backbone echo. Anybody who is
interested should be able to obtain a feed through their normal backbone
sources. We already span the coasts of the US! This means that even more
people who are interested in discussing science and technology can now
participate.

From scientists to students, if you have a question, if you'd like to
share your knowledge, if you want to discuss the latest findings in
scientific journals or the popular press, or if you just want to talk to
others with similar interests, without all the "noise" you may find
elsewhere, SCI&TECH is the place for you.

If you're interested, just call up your regular backbone source!

     -- David Bloomberg, Hector Mandel, Melissa Woo, and Eric Larson

Fitness Echo

After a few trips to the doctor and discovering that the only reason
I was having back problems was due to the fact I didn't exercise enough,
I decided to start working out again. I soon was so involved with
pumping iron, I started feeling guilty when I didn't make a daily
trip to the gym. I wanted an Echo that dealt with all aspects of
physical fitness, but none were available. So I have decided FIDO
needs to have an echo dedicated to the health and fitness of the
human body.

The "FITNESS" echo is currently available locally in the NET 106 area.
Some topics of the echo are.. aerobics, nutrition, weight control,
weight lifting, body building, running, biking, heart fitness, sports
medicine and home exercise just to name a few. We hope to spread the
echo to the national backbone soon.

If you would like to receive the FITNESS echo, please send netmail
to your NEC or ZEC requesting the "FITNESS" echo. If you can't wait
for it to go nationally, please netmail me at 1:106/5999@Fidonet
and I will be happy to arrange distribution.


The "FITNESS" echo is now available here locally to about 10 sites and
we are hoping to expand to the national backbone soon.

                 OPENDOORS ECHO NOW AVAILABLE!
                 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

OPENDOORS is an internationally distributed echo designed for
discussion of BBS door/utility programming, and in particular,
Brian Pirie's OpenDoors C Library!

The OpenDoors door programming toolkit and BBS interface package is
used by Turbo C(++) / Borland C++ programmers, to write doors and
utilities that are compatible with RA, Maximus, QuickBBS and many
other BBS systems.

The OPENDOORS Echo was created by a group of dedicated BBS door and
utility programmers and designers, in order to promote discussions on
BBS utility programming techniques, tasks, standards, and trends.

This echo is not just for BBS door authors!  Discussion of
practically any aspect of BBS programming is encouraged.  Brian
Pirie, the author of OpenDoors is available for tech support, as
are his beta-testers.

The echo is not currently on the FidoNet backbone, but a feed is
available from the following nodes:

Scott Burkett  1:3613/12  9600v.32 Columbus, GA
Mike Gurski    1:261/1062 2400     Baltimore, MD

A New Star Trek Echo - STDSN
By Ray Brown, Moderator
SysOp, SpacePort Miami, 1:135/70


      Greetings and salutations, fellow Trekkers/Trekkies!
I'd like to announce a new echo, called STDSN. This echo is
for discussion of the upcoming new Star Trek television series,
"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine". This new series, which is not yet
in production as of this writing, is still committed to being
shown over the airwaves, starting in January, 1993, and
continuing for at least 22 episodes. This new show will, in most
cases, be seen just before, or just after, "Star Trek: The Next
Generation" (now starting its' Sixth Season) in your area.

     The topic of discussion will be all things that relate to
this new series, including, but not limited to, the actors &
actresses that'll appear, the screenplays, and any "cross-over"
of characters between the new series and the "ST:TNG" series
(some is expected, more is anticipated). Discussion of The
Original Series (TOS) of Star Trek will be off-limits.
FidoNews 9-31                  Page 16                      3 Aug 1992


     This new echo is currently seen on eight BBS's, with a
request in the works to place it on at least two FidoNet Regions
as Regional Echos. And, if traffic continues to increase, the echo
will be elgible for requesting "Backbone" status in a short
length of time.

     But, for now, STDSN is privately distributed on the east side
of the Mississippi by me (1:135/70, North Miami, FL), and on the
west side by Cindy Hill, of 1:104/43 (Denver, CO). Anybody is
welcome to call and request the echo on HOLD for them to poll
any time (except ZMH, of course!) from either location.

     The rules of the echo are f'able from me as STDSN.RUL, if
anyone is interested (and a copy will be sent to Mike Fuchs'
system for inclusion into the EchoList). The echo has been
duly noted as being in the EchoList as of EList.207.

     Thank you, and keep on Trekkin'!!

             SKEPTIC Echo is alive and well!

SKEPTIC is now a Backbone Echo that originally sprang forth
from the San Francisco area. It now originates from Zone 3
in Adelaide, Australia under the Moderatorship of Jackson
Harding at 3:681/857 and is Hubbed into Zones 1 and 2 by
1:374/14. It is Hubbed into Zone 6 from 3:681/857. The
Zone 2 Hub is Dieter Hummel at 2:241/6001.

If any of you or your Sysops are interested in obtaining
this Echo, you or they should contact their regular,
Backbone Echo source! SKEPTIC now appears in FIDONET.NA as
of 2 May 92.

SKEPTIC is devoted to examination and report of paranormal
and fringe-science claims. It has NO official or unofficial
connection to CSICOP {Committee for the Scientific
Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal} but has a similar
philosophy. Claims are not rejected on a priori grounds but
rather are investigated by objective and critical inquiry.

FidoNews 9-31                  Page 17                      3 Aug 1992


The Echo is now fully activated and waiting for those with
an interest in the mission stated above.

Complete information about the Echo may be found in the
current issue of the EList and the ELRules files.

Come and join us in the pursuit of knowledge! [grin]

We are running a Florida-wide Echo [FLA_COOKS] that deals
with cooking and eating throughout the state. Use of native
ingredients and regional specialties will be included as
well as restaurant reviews and anything else that pertains
to food in Florida.

FLA_COOKS is Hubbed and Moderated by Christopher Baker at
1:374/14 in Titusville_FL, by Ronnie Toth at 1:135/71 in
Hialeah_FL [which is a PC Pursuitable town {part of Greater
Miami}], and by Larry Squire at 1:3620/9 in St. Augustine

also being carried on the Region 18 Backbone at 1:151/1003.

That's the general idea. [grin]

The Echo tag is FLA_COOKS. In addition, Florida systems
should have their Florida city in their origin line so
everyone knows what part of Florida you are talking about
and if you mention a specific place or area, you should
define it as if people outside your immediate area are
reading it [as they will be]. This ain't a 'local' Echo
anymore! [grin]
