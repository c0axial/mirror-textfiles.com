                                 BACKMAIL

     Product Description:  A new kind of micro-computer communications
     program which provides modem  to modem E-Mail and  file transfers
     etween any two MS-DOS machines running the program.

     A small (35K  RAM) TSR automatically  schedules, calls and  sends
     mail to up to 100 destinations  at a time in the background.  TSR
     answers  the  phone,  receives  messages  or  files and sends any
     messages or files addressed to the calling program (identified by
     phone number). Automatically retries  if busy, or broken  connec-
     tion.  A  hot  key  brings  up  (by  memory swapping) a front end
     program which  allows the  user to  read, send  and monitor  mail
     flow. *Very* fast and  unobtrusive in operation. Point  and shoot
     menus throughout. Easy to use.

     A full screen text editor for messages (max 3.5K), word wrap,full
     cursor movement. Messages  automatically stamped with:  time sent
     or received; letter heads, forwarding and reply history. Incoming
     and outgoing mail listed by subject line, time received or posted
     and destination name.  Mailboxes support: delete  message, delete
     all  messages,  delete  all  read/sent  messages. Messages can be
     appended to separate files. On screen notification of arrival  of
     mail.

     Eight user definable  prefixes (for inter-office  numbers, local,
     long  distance...).  Handles  Long  numbers  or short extensions.
     Allows separate  phone entries  for destination's  voice and data
     lines. Destinations can be give priority in scheduling.  Destina-
     tions can  me marked  so calling system refuses return  mail (for
     long distance calling).

     Status Display shows pending messages, number of times called for
     all pending  files or  messages. Calls  to specific  destinations
     can be suspended so traffic  is delivered only when that  destin-
     ation calls.  Status Display  also records  aborted transmissions
     with diagnosis of cause of failure.

     Program maintains  a mailing  list of  up to  1000 phone numbers.
     Messages are addressed by menu of phone directory. A message  can
     be  addressed  to  up  to  100  separate destinations per access.
     Allows  bulk  mailing  for  inter-office  or local numbers (up to
     1000).

     For  each  destination  in  mailing  directory the program stores
     information on when the destination is available for data traffic
     and how  many times  the destination  should be  retried if busy.
     Each user declares own availability time and maximum retries  and
     this info is exchanged whenever two BackMails communicate.  Calls
     are automatically scheduled and retried to take account of  dest-
     ination's window of availability.

     File directory listing, wildcards permitted. Up to 100 files  can
     be addressed at to 1-100 separate destinations each access. Sends
     files of any size. File sending protocol insures destination  has
     sufficient disk space.

     Setup menu allows user  extensive control of program  parameters,
     including: toggle  user notification,  data only  versus voice  &
     data operation, Wait for dial tone, defining hot keys, on  screen
     clock, screen colors, customized modem command strings and  modem
     response codes. Happily cohabits with most other TSRs.

     The program is share ware.  It periodically asks you to  register
     your copy ($30), whines for 20 seconds if you don't. To  register
     you hit a key and fill out a form with credit card info. As  soon
     as  the  registration  screen  is  completed the program will not
     bother you again.  The credit card  info is sent  to an 800  data
     number (US & Canada).  Registered users receive strong  technical
     support.

     BackMail  is  available  through  BBS's and Information services.
     Alethic  offers  SYSOPS  and  SIGs  a  royalty  arrangement which
     provides  a  $3.00  royalty  for  each  copy  registered. Contact
     Alethic for details. Alethic Software, 52 Parkhill Road, Halifax,

     FOLLOWUP TO "LAST SATURDAY"
     Tom Jennings
     Node 1:125/111

     This short article is a followup to the one in FNEWS5-48; maybe
     it will provide a little background and answer some questions.

     The FidoNet itself was based upon the principles I try to live my
     life by; respecting others rights, principles and lives; self-
     determination, and organization by cooperation, not coercion. All
     of these are, after all, the most basic anarchist principles.
     There is no contradiction in what I say vs. what I do.

     The language in the article was a violent response to a violent
     day. And yes, my life is my personal business only, and not
     yours: however there are people out there who want to meddle in
     MY business for THEIR reasons. I have no right to interfere with
     you if you like to hang out in suburban malls, stay home and read
     the Bible, join the army, drop out of school and become a hippy,
     or anthing else that doesn't interfere with MY life.

     The very first negative comment I received said "All that you
     have done is to reinforce the views about homosexuals held by
     such unthinking individuals as the driver of that car. And you
     may have steered some of the rest of us toward the same path by
     your inclusion of such explicit terms and references..."

     Well spoken: this is exactly what my article is about. The second
     sentence above says that in response to what I wrote, violence
     against me, and the legal (or not) removal of my rights is an
     acceptable response.

     Now after reading my article you could call me an ass, tasteless,
     rude, disgusting, awful, inconsiderate, perverse, whatever you
     want, you're entitled to your opinion. But violence? I cannot
     tell you how common this train of thought is, and how often it is
     followed up with violence or death. It is simply a
     rationalization of the desire to commit violence upon someone,
     for reasons of the perpetrators alone. This is what my article is
     about. No, it's not very pleasant at all, is it?

     The article had almost nothing to do with sexuality; it had to do
     with fascist (look it up in a dictionary) behaviour, as it
     exists, today, in the USA. I never said that IV (or any other)
     drug use is "OK", or unprotected anal sex is "OK", or that you or
     I would find these things comfortable subjects. Nor are they
     related except for disease transmission. Gay people do them no
     more often than straight ones. The fact remains that many people
     DO do these things, that's life, even people who read this
     newsletter.

     Defending peoples rights is not the same as defending what they
     do. I will defend myself, my friends, and your right to live as
     we each see fit. That, my friends, is what fighting for
     individual freedom, and First Amendment rights, really means.
     Have you ever read the United States Constitution? Read it, and
     FidoNews 6-01                Page 4                    2 Jan 1989


     see the intent behind the words. Look around you and see the
     attempts to circumvent it. Send me $1.00 (Tom Jennings, Box
     77731, San Francisco CA 94107) and I will mail you a typeset
     copy, nicely annotated, for your reference.

     I've said more than I planned on the subject; I'm not here to
     argue with anybody, you can believe what you want. I do not like
     to argue politics or personal ethics, it offends everyone. This
     is the last I will say on this subject.

     Remember the quote by that Catholic priest in Nazi Germany: "When
     they came for the jews, I didn't object because I wasn't a jew
     ... when they came for me, there was no one left to object."


     Sheesh, I'm not usually so grim and serious. I promise I'll
     shut up now. I have received more positive mail than hate mail,
     and that's a good sign. But hell, I knew the net was filled with
     mostly cool intelligent people, and could absorb something a
     a bit (ahem) shocking. Sometimes things don't get spoken,
     because... they just don't get said. Inertia. Time to speak out,
     boys and girls.

                                 * * *

     As an aside, from my point of view, the network, all 4000+ nodes,
     seems to run amazingly well. I know there's a lot of fighting
     over control structures and such, as in the current trauma over
     "other" networks, but the fact remains I can send a message just
     about anywhere with incredible reliability. We haven't been
     struck dumb by Babel, the nodelist is still wonderful, and the
     RCs and NCs do a damn good job. Looks great!!!

                           VETNet is ALIVE!!!!!
     By:  Todd C. Looney
          Vietnam Veterans' Valhalla
          1:143/27  300/1200/2400 Bauds
          (408) 293-7894

          The sysops  of the  Vietnam Veterans Valhalla bulletin board
     are both  Vietnam combat  veterans; I  served during the war as a
     Medical Field  Surgeon in  the U.S. Navy attached to an Emergency
     Field Evac  Hospital and  later a  long-range recon team near Dac
     To, and  spent more than my fair share of time in a VC/NVA prison
     camp across  the border  in Laos,  and Nancy  my wife,  who is  a
     veteran of a different sort having fought HER war *years* after I
     returned to  the   United States,   battling   the    problems  I
     brought   back   from   that   little country tucked thousands of
     miles away  in Southeast  Asia.    Nancy and I have, for the most
     part, conquered  all of  the  problems  of  that  traumatic  past
     through years of hard work!
          Many   of the  men and  women who  returned  from  that  war
     continue   to carry it's memories and nightmares with them today.
     Although most  Vietnam veterans  live a  successful, happy  life,
     there are  those whose every day is a bitter struggle to survive,
     trying to  find some  way to either escape the horrible memories,
     or to  come to  terms with  themselves so they and their families
     can begin to live a normal life!!
          We feel  it is  our responsibility  as caring and empathetic
     individuals    to  share  ourselves  with  those  Vietnam  combat
     veterans of  both kinds;  the  ex-military  soldier-at-arms,  and
     their wives,  friends, and lovers, with the hope that somehow the
     knowledge    and    understanding    we  gained  from  the  years
     encompassing our own struggle might be of some help to those who
     are still fighting their war!!!

               THE VIETNAM VETERANS' VALHALLA BULLETIN BOARD
                     IS DEDICATED TO VIETNAM VETERANS,
                      THEIR WIVES, FRIENDS, & LOVERS!

     And to the memory of the 58,000 men and women who never came home

          Our system  has been  successfully operating  for  nearly  3
     years now,  and received well over 37,000 calls!  We also founded
     and   coordinated    the    International    Vietnam    Veterans'
     EchoConference (IVVEC)  which  can  be  seen  on  more  than  200
     bulletin boards  across the United States, Canada, and Australia.
     Please contact  our system,  or one of the nodes listed below who
     carry our conference and join in.  You don't need to be a veteran
     of any  kind to  participate.   We welcome  you with open arms to
     learn who we are and what we are all about!
          Nancy and  I are  looking forward to meeting you all, as are
     the Sysops of the nearly 200 VETNet BBs systems below:

                 RegComm - Communications From RegCon.

     A very happy holiday season  to you and yours from  your Regional
     Coordinators.  May  you all enjoy  the best of  everything and we
     look forward to another year  helping make FidoNet what YOU  want
     it to be.

     It looks like we're moving ahead rapidly on the implementation of
     new nodelist flags.  The tentative schedule is to have a revision
     out on the  23rd of December  with comments and  completion on or
     before January 13, 1989.  As  soon as the new nodelist flags  are
     accepted we will begin implementation and hopefully the new flags
     will all be in place by February 15th.  Like all schedules,  this
     one is not cast in concrete but is the target.  We will certainly
     do our best to help assure  that all changes are made as  quickly
     as possible.  If there  are incorrect flags listed for  any node,
     all flags  will be  stripped and  that node  will be  listed as a
     "plain vanilla" node  handling mail during  Zone Mail Hour  only.
     That will help  us spot any  that were missed  and assure we  get
     them  corrected  quickly.    We'll  do  our  best to keep all Net
     Coordinators advised  as to  the schedule  so the  changes can be
     made as smoothly as possible.

     The RegCon  team is  also implementing  a method  to protect  the
     delivery of the nodediff.  This method will be a very basic  one,
     designed to  avoid the  possibility of  anyone sending  out a bad
     nodediff to the net, either by  accident or by intent.  There  is
     also a  program available  in most  areas named  CRCNODE.EXE that
     will run a quick test of the nodediff to see if the CRC is  still
     valid.  While some feel these steps unnecessary, we have  decided
     that it's worth a little more work from us to help assure you get
     an accurate and uncorrupted nodediff.  No-one enjoys chasing  all
     over looking for a nodediff unnecessarily.

     There has  recently been  a considerable  amount of  conversation
     taking place  in several  conferences concerning  the practice of
     making private messages public  without permission of the  person
     sending  the  private  message.    As there are several different
     opinions on additions to FidoNet policy concerning messages  sent
     by NetMail that  are `private', we  would like your  input on the
     matter.  Is  private NetMail to  be handled as  the word intends,
     "not for public or common use", or should we be more liberal  and
     allow  open  dissemination  of  all  NetMail?   Please share your
     feelings on this by NetMail  to your Regional Coordinator.   Your
     input will help us formulate the next version of FidoNet policy.

     ("RegComm" will be a weekly column in FidoNews and your  comments
     are  welcome.  Please  address  your  concerns  and  comments via
     NetMail to your Net  or Regional Coordinator, you  should receive
     an answer within a few days. It's your net and we are in need  of
     your input in order for us to fairly represent you.)

                      ROGEL'S CORNER:  LAPTOPS --
                  A LOT OF COMPUTER POWER ON THE HOOF
     =============================================================

              -------------------------------------------
              | Laptops: Decisions, decision, decisions |
              -------------------------------------------

     Last year at about this time the "field" of laptop contenders
     was fairly small and the prices  were fairly  high.   In fact
     the  choice  of  laptop  was  fairly  easy, provided you were
     willing to make some big  sacrifices  in  computing  power in
     order to "have one for the road".

     In the  July 21,  1987 issue of PC Magazine (Vol. 6, No. 13),
     Paul Somerson raved about the Z-183 which "sprints along at 8
     MHz". The  October 27, 1987 issue of PC Magazine (Vol. 6, No.
     18) recommended "for big spenders, the  dazzling Zenith Z-181
     or Z-183  Portable PC  . .  . with its 10-megabyte hard disk,
     8-MHz  clock  speed,  and  remarkable  6-by   8-inch  backlit
     display, the Z-183 remains a heart-stopper."

     Less than 6 months later, however, the Z-183 fell from grace;
     this time Mr. Somerson criticized the  Z-183 as,  among other
     shortcomings, being  "a real  arm-stretcher" and with a 8-MHz
     speed, it  "plods  along  with  an  anachronistic  CMOS 8088"
     (March 29,  1988 issue,  Vol. 7, No. 6).  What happened to it
     being a "heart-stopper"?  Was Mr. Somerson guilty of having a
     fickle  heart,  did  the  Z-183  change for the worse, or was
     there something else?

     Choose door number 3:  something else.   That  something else
     was improved competition offering laptops with more speed and
     more power.

     Laptop computers have finally come of age.  Finally convinced
     that a promising market for laptops does exist, manufacturers
     have been falling over themselves  to  get  new  and improved
     laptops into  the stream  of commerce.  A week does not go by
     now without an  announcement  in  the  computer  trade papers
     about a new laptop.

     No longer is this market limited to just a few companies such
     as NEC, Toshiba,  and  Zenith.    The  Olivetti's, Samsung's,
     Mitsubishi's, and  many others are entering the fray and each
     trying  to  outdo  the  others  with  feature-rich portables.
     These features  include 286,  386SX, and 386 chip technology;
     substantially  improved  screen  displays;  the  addition  of
     standard, non-proprietary  expansion slots; increased RAM and
     support for EMS; and larger storage capacity.   If rumors are
     to be  believed, we may even see color screen displays in the
     near future.

     The  consumer   is   the   beneficiary   of   this  increased
     competition.   Although choosing  a laptop  in today's market
     will not be as easy as  it was  a year  ago, it  will be much

     more exciting.

     I  have  prepared  a  chart, set out below, comparing various
     features of some popular  and/or  new  laptops.    This chart
     contains  only  a  sampling  of  the  many  laptops presently
     available.    [The  original  chart  has  been  substantially
     modified to satisfy FidoNews' margin requirements]

     In view  of the  prospects of  an increasing number of faster
     and more powerful laptops entering  the  market  in  the next
     several  months,  anyone  interested  in  purchasing a laptop
     should use this chart as a starting point only and  then keep
     abreast  of  current  laptop developments through PC Magazine
     and other  computer publications.   Two  magazines devoted to
     portable computers  are listed at the end of this column.

     Finally, I have included a brief discussion about the variety
     of screen display technology that is or may soon be available
     for laptops.

                     -----------------------------

     1.   Liquid Crystal Display (LCD)

          a.   General
               Like the  technology used  on watches  and
               calculators, the LCD has the advantage of being
               lightweight and  consuming little battery power.
               Its  disadvantages  include  poor
               contrast/readability.

          b.   Supertwist
               i.   non-backlit
                    The screen  is twisted so that it will reflect
                    light in all directions and not  just straight
                    ahead.

               ii.  backlit
                    By adding  light to the supertwist screen,
                    readability is improved by at the  expense of
                    greater battery power consumption.

                    (1)  Electroluminescent (EL)
                         The screen,  containing phosphor, glows
                         when powered.

                    (2)  Fluorescent
                         Small tubes provide the backlighting.
                         Slightly more  battery power is used than
                         with the electroluminescent screens.
                         Examples include Datavue's amber gaslight
                         and, apparently, Zenith's newest  laptop
                         entry, the  TurbosPort 386, featuring
                         black characters on a white screen.  This
                         display, which  Zenith calls its "page
                         white" display, is the product of an
                         extra layer  of polarizing material which
                         filters out blue light from the screen.

     2.   Neutralized Twisted Nematic (NTN)
     FidoNews 6-01                Page 19                   2 Jan 1989


          Light is used to increase the screen's contrast  ratio,
          resulting in  a black on white image.  Mitsubishi's new
          MP286L with an 11-inch cold cathode tube (CCT)  screen
          and black  characters on a white background (with
          reversible screen colors), which Mitsubishi claims  can
          be read in all light conditions, is an excellent example
          of this new technology.

     3.   Gas Plasma

          A flat panel non-LCD screen.  Each screen pixel is on or
          off, providing  a high contrast ration but requiring
          greater power. Toshiba's high-end laptops use  this type
          of technology.

     4.   Active Matrix

          A transistor is assigned to each screen pixel, resulting
          in a contrast equivalent to a backlit LCD but without
          the backlighting.   Apparently  the screen  becomes
          unusable if any one transistor ceases to operate.
          According to  *DataGram*, this  technology is  being
          considered by several laptop manufacturers but is not
          presently available.

                      Yet Another Complicated Komment

                            by Steven K. Hoskin

                            Episode 20:  Culture


     Reading the IFNA EchoMail  conference  is  good fuel for FidoNews
     columns and articles.   There's  a  lot  of people out there, all
     with ideas, a lot of discussions,  generally pertinent to FidoNet
     and, therefore, FidoNews.    There's  the  occasional humor, too,
     which I personally find  a  pleasant  relief from all the serious
     talk (and yell) that goes on out there.

     Something is becoming  clear  to  me,  however.  IFNA, SYSOP, and
     many other important EchoMail Conferences go all over FidoNet; as
     it should be.  So does FidoNews.   But FidoNews, and a great many
     of the international conferences,  are usually very American; de-
     signed, written, subscribed to  and supported by Americans.  This
     isn't in itself a bad  thing.    I'm  American and certainly I am
     proud of my country, hence why  I  serve in its armed forces; and
     of course I agree  that  we've  done  some  rather odd, sometimes
     stupid, things in our short 202 years here.

     But we are not the world.  And FidoNet doesn't stay in the United
     States anymore.  It hasn't for a long time.  And there's a senti-
     ment out there that Americans are  simply not welcome in some in-
     ternational conferences that are otherwise open to members of any
     race, color, creed or national origin.

     Why?  We're seen as  arrogant,  and  perhaps  rightly so.  We are
     quite accumstomed to being free to do just about anything we darn
     well please over here,  and  often  neglect to realize that other
     cultures do  not  always  afford  the  same  freedoms.  There are
     places in the world  where  something  you  say  can be cause for
     death - by law.  That is one  of  the more morbid conditions, but
     is an indication of how carefully  we  must tread if we are going
     to cross international  and  cultural  boundaries.    Usually our
     trespasses are not across  "blood  lines" of death, but rather of
     "social lines".  There are  subjects  that simply are not accept-
     able discussion material in  some  places.  It's considered to be
     in bad taste.

     Americans have, in the past 50 years or so, been increasingly un-
     interested in cultural development;  education in other cultures.
     Because of this we are insulting  people worldwide, usually unin-
     tentionally and often  unknowingly.    But  THEY are noticing it.
     Freedom of speech is great, but open-mindedness is, too.
