========================================================================
Last week i tried a new experiment.  i took the most primordial of
the plants, which is in a flimsy but plastic container, and i put
it outside in the open air, on the balcony, where it could get more
light.  It had grown too big to put on a window ledge.

The wind blew it over during an electrical storm.  Some of its
leaves came to rest on the tin flooring the balcony, and when the
bright sun came down in the morning and the tin heated up, they
burned.  Now this plant requires much careful, tender watering,
and other, sturdier, hybrid plants in heavy pots to prop it up
while new leaves grow.

Nodelist Size

Subject: Nodelist Size
Author:  Ron Pritchett (1:376/74.0)

I've noticed that most of the solutions to getting the nodelist down
to a reasonable size seem to fall into two categories:
  1) Remove the "driftwood" by
     a) keeping the nodelist up-to-date or
     b) allowing new flags to replace common user flags
  2) Break up the nodelist

While I certainly support 1b, that's not what this article is about. I
can help fidonet with 1a and here's how. It dawned on my this
afternoon that many RCs/NCs out there may not be aware of a useful
little utility that I wrote a while back, so I decided to write this
article.

The utility is called NetStat and I used it to manage the local
nodelist in Net 376 when I was NC. Every 6 months I would send out a
netmail msg to each node that contained all their nodelist info. They
had 30 days to respond to it. They could tell me that the info was
up-to-date or alert me of any new info, and if they didn't respond
within 30 days, they were promptly dropped from the nodelist.

While this may seem quite radical for some NCs, it was very effective.
I gave each node 3 notices and allowed them to respond via netmail or
voice. If the system couldn't meet the regulation of being able to
send/recieve netmail (for an entire month) then they didn't need to be
in the nodelist IMHO. Here's an example of how it works:

Just feed in a St. Louis style nodelist segment into the program, and
the program will generate a detailed msg for each node. (I truncated
this to 64 cols for the sake of this article -------------------vv)

staff.  The topics of discussion in this field are many and varied, from
the latest in management philosophies to dealing with specific staff
supervision situations.  It is an open forum to get feedback on problem
solving action plans, advice on how to handle specific management
situations, or anything else related to the subject of management.

CAT_TORTURE
From: Fredric Rice  (1:102/890)

Greetings, Silvia!

I have to laugh!  Bless my atheist heathen soul but the absurdity of
this silly "cat_torture" nonsense is just too entertaining.  It has
become something other than wholly entertaining of late and yet the
irony prompts me to laugh yet again -- yet for different reasons.

I had thought that perhaps -- just perhaps -- the information about
the "hellish Zeta-rays" and the utter foolishness I posted would
have "cur-tailed" these negative vibrations from growing as they
have.  Not only can a couple of guys and gals not take a joke, knowing
that Michael Johnson held his whole body firmly against two or three
cheeks, someone felt compelled to widen the metaphore for absurdity
into the realm of the decidedly not fun.  And the irony makes me giggle.

To protest what they feel is an injustice against cats, they launch
what they feel is an equal injustice against children.  As I have said
before:

    All the gut-wrenching irony of America's low prioritization
    of education is present in your origin line. - Fredric Rice

And in the stupidity of those who would suggest "CHILD_TORTURE."

You got balls, my dear cyber-sweetheart, for publishing the un-fun
metaphore CHILD_TORTURE.  Let none say that you are not truely and
demonstrably a bastion of free speech.  <laugh>  But in not letting
them say it, we then engage in censorship, don't we?

<chuckle>  Irony is all over this place.  But then you knew what the

job would be like going in, didn't you?

UN-FLAGS -Unpublished- Nodelist Flags Analyzer

UN-FLAGS -Unpublished- Nodelist Flags Analyzer
by Bob Swift, 1:342/5

This program is my way of making a statement regarding the controversy
surrounding nodelist flags.  There are many points of view on this
issue, but I believe that they all come down to two.  Those who want
more flags, and those who want less.  Those who are promoting the
reduction in the number of nodelist flags generally use the massive
size of the nodelist as their argument.  Those calling for more flags
counter with the argument that the various mailers available use this
information for dynamically setting session data.  Both are correct, in
their own way.  I tend to believe that many of those calling for new
flags are really looking for more to fly as a status thing.

If we really want to reduce the nodelist, why not eliminate the flags
from systems that do not have a published telephone number.  What use
are these flags to a mailer when the node can't be called anyway?  I
believe that these serve no useful purpose, and are vanity at its
finest.  In order to illustrate the uselessness of these flags, this
program was developed.

This program is designed to read a nodelist file and report on the
nodes that are marked with a phone number of -Unpublished-.

The program package (including all 'C' source code) is available as
UNFLG101.ZIP for download or file request from 1:342/5 anytime outside
of Z1MH.  A sample of the output is shown below (Summary Report), and
the program will also optionally produce a list of "-Unpublished-"
nodes with their flags.

Complaint about the language using in FidoNet
From: Wing Kin Chan <100314.2115@compuserve.com>

Dear Sylvia,

I wanted to complaint about something which happened in my local
FidoNet Mail Echo.  Because I don't know where to send my complaint,
so I just send you my letter.

I am a doctor and living in Macau (a city near Hong Kong).  Over 90%
of citizens is using Chinese as their motherlanguage here.  And I
like to access the local  BBS,  some of them are the nodes of
FidoNet.  We wrote the local messages with Chinese since long long
ago.  But recently, some of these SysOps created some rules which
inhibited us for using Chinese in some local echos.  Like techical
echo...etc. As you know, most of us are Chinese.  It is certainly
for us to use Chinese in our living.  Therefore, I have some
questions.  Over 50% of the users are students, they are bad in
English.  For what reason to force us to use English only?  Why we
cannot use our motherlanguage to talk with each others?  Do these
SysOps have rights to build up these kind of rules?  If someone who
don't know English, doesn't he cannot access these echos to ask for
assistance?  I think the language is used for us to communication,
why are there so many restriction?

Best Regards,
Wing Kin Chan

Some words about Net700 Problems
Chris Leung (6:700/703 aka 6:700/0)

A heavy rainfall this morning in Hong Kong was there.
The sky was dark and roads were wet.
No bird sang and all trees wept.
So uncomfortable was my current net...

Clouds are here and wind is there.
As the sky is getting clear and clear,
People who have eyes can see and see
FidoNews 11-28                 Page:  8                    11 Jul 1994

The Dawn is coming to light up all mountains and sea.

In view of the recent queries about Net700 raised in FidoNews 11-23,
I would like to say a few words here trying to alleviate the
uncomfortable feelings towards our network.

FidoNet is an amateur network.  To the best of my understanding,
it is designed in a way that no one central authority can monopolize
the administration (Node Issue) and services (EchoMail & FileEcho) of
the network. We are all free here. As long as POLICY4 is not breached,
fido members should be able to do whatever they like.  It is the
participation and contributions of sysops and users that help make
our network better.

There had been a golden time in Net700.  Our former NC had
contributed a lot in establishing the structure and services of the
current Net700.  Quite a number of current sysops are content with
this. However, when I try to consider the context from an outsiders'
viewpoint, a totally different picture comes to my eyes.

I see monopoly and control from a group of big brothers.  Many point
systems have been applying for official nodes for nearly a
year but still do not get any reply.  The network nodelist is seldom
updated.  What can I do?  Just simply sit back enjoying my
privileges and ignore those outsiders...?  I am afraid this is not
fair.  Amongst all possible alternatives, I think taking over the job
of NC is the good start to improve the situation.  There is no
denying that in our network there are many many veteran sysops who
are qualified to take over the NC post.  Experience and seniority do
count.  But should they be the sole criterion...?  People nowadays
just get used to recognize others by their wealth, titles, seniority
and power...  Should the BBS community follow this norm also?  I
really doubt!

Net700 is just a small potato in the whole FidoNet.  It is not my
intention to re-start any flame here.  To be or not to be an NC
with my fellow sysops' support is not my utmost concern.  No matter
what they think, I shall follow POLICY4 and resume the administration
of Net700 from now onwards. However, I do hope sysops who concern
Net700 will consider the two sides of the coin before making any
judgement.

Thank you for your attention.

That's an encrypted message above, folks.  Gonna sue me?

BTW, don't bother trying to decrypt it; I'll do that for you.  It says
"fuck you."

All would-be censors take note; the world is still spinning.
Communism hasn't rushed in to topple apple pie, hotdogs, baseball, and
your mother.  The sun is still burning, the Earth is still turning,
and 5 billion people (give or take a couple lunatics) don't care what
kind of language is used in this publication.  Don't like it?  Don't
read it.  Nobody says you have to learn anything; ignorance is your
right, no matter in what country you happen to live.

Just don't try to force the rest of us down to your level, 'k?

P.S. I still haven't seen anything in the 'snooze to date that I
wouldn't let my kids see.  Feel free not to give *YOUR* kids a copy
of any issue with which you take offense.

Politicking for politics sake!
From: Keith Wassell   (2:440/1)

Hello editors!

I saw your editorial in Fidonews this week (11-26) and was a little
dismayed at the one-sidedness that it portrayed.

Maybe you would like to now look at the geonets rule, and its
advantage in preventing troublemakers, or facists, or Racialists
from setting up their own 'Elite' networks ?  Every cloud has a
silver lining somewhere.

I have been approaced in the past, by Irish people suggesting that
there should be a 'Catholics only' net in Northern Ireland.

You hit the nail on the head when you said it is the sysops who own
their BBS's NOBODY owns the network, barring someone has copyright
of the name Fidonet.  The network has evolved over ten or so years,
and policy was not put there just to hinder peoples freedom.  The
freedom of people is as such.  The net is there for your use.  It has
rules.  If you want to play, then you abide by them.  If you don't
want to abide by them, then go find another place to play, which
has different rules.

Until fidonet as a whole votes for a new policy, then, we have to
stick to the old one.

Dear Madam Emilia

Q:  Why are local languages sometimes banned from local echos in
places where English is not the major language?

A:  Hmmmm.  Perhaps obeying of rules occasionally leads to
abeyance of functionality.

Q:   I am conscious that there is occasionally something wrong with
the way I correspond with others.  Sometimes I reach a level of
intimacy with friends, and when i reach that point, i no longer
express myself well. What am I doing wrong?

A:  This electronic medium does allow for intimacy, because you sit
alone with your computer, and write whatever is in your head while
you are writing.  But you can not visually see the people you are
writing too.  You must remember to "see" them psychologically,
because they are really there.  A private letter is TO some one,
not merely a collection of thoughts you are having which you happen
to address to them becuase their very existence has made you feel safe
enough to think freely.

Q:  Ooooh no!  This is horrible.  I have been abusive to those who
have made me feel confortable.  What should i do now?

A:  Be aware you must never stop examining and re-evaluating your
mental processes and your behaviour or you will stop growing.  A
wise friend said to me the other day, "Fidonet is very resilient.
It would not have lasted this long if it were not."

Q:  What does religion have to do with geography?

A:  I do not know.  But national-ism and religion-ism are similar
in many ways.
