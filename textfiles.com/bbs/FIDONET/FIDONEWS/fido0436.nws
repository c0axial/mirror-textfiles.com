     This week's guest editorial is by Don Kulha, 1:125/7


     On Friday eve at the Net conference in VA,  as the  after  dinner
     presentations  were winding down,  Tom Jennings asked if he could
     say something.  The following is a transcript of what he  had  to
     say:

         "I'd like to say something here.

         "It's  not  going  to be very pleasant and it comes at a real
         bad time because, I mean,  I feel really bad.  We're all here
         and I like everyone here.  The purpose of this is supposed to
         be telecommunicating.  I just  feel  a  serious  conflict  of
         interest on the board of directors.  You figure out,  of they
         on the stand,  what the issues are.  There's talk of changing
         standards,  changes just assumed to be put in during the next
         few months;  sort of...what committee do we have here?  I  do
         not  want  to  be on the board of directors,  I intentionally
         said I do not want to be on the board. I have severe conflict
         of interest and there are other authors who should not be  on
         the board what-so-ever.

         "There's no pleasant way to say it and, uh, there it is.  You
         can view this from my point of view [that] there's  a  rather
         severe  interest  in  anarchy  here.  This was an implemented
         archist scheme of sorts.  It's run by the members of the  net
         and  we  now  have a top-down structure.  So....for what it's
         worth, my two cents..."

         (17 seconds of silence -- Ken closes the meeting)

     Hearing Tom's emotion filled speech I started thinking about  the
     net, our directions and the dissention within our ranks.  We have
     a great  bunch  of  folks  working  with  IFNA  and  the  various
     committees. Some of them, and various people in our network, have
     concerns  about  where  we  are  going.  My  own  thought is that
     something important to remember is  that  our  association  is  a
     dynamic entity; it changes in relationship to the desires of it's
     active participants.

     Active participants are the key words there.  Before heading back
     to VA I heard a lot of folks saying the wouldn't go because  they
     didn't  like  some  of the things they percieved to be happening.
     Some other seemed to feel that since they were running Opus there
     was little reason  to  go  --  with  which  I  do  most  strongly
     disagree.  The  conference was not about Fido or any other single
     thing;  it was about communicating and  networking.  I  think  of
     anarchy  in our context as not necessarily meaning the absence of
     order,  but that the  largest  possible  number  of  interest  be
     represented  in and help shape our net.  Diversity is healthy and
     it's the yeast we  need  to  keep  the  net  vital,  growing  and
     FidoNews 4-36                Page 2                   21 Sep 1987


     evolving.  We  really  need  a  lot  more of you participating in
     helping shape our directions

     IFNA will not be tommorrow what it is today;  everything evolves.
     Membership  in  IFNA  isn't  a  vote  in  support for whatever is
     happening at this particular point  in  time,  I  think  it's  an
     expression  of  your  interest  in  promoting communication.  The
     dollars requested just help cover real costs,  are well accounted
     for  and  (I personally think) act as a bullshit filter,  keeping
     those less than serious from mucking  up  the  works.  Everything
     about  IFNA  is mutable and will change with the passage of time,
     and with your participation.  Please do.

     Amendments of Part 69
     of the Commission's Rules

                      NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULE MAKING

     Adopted:  June 10, 1987:           Released:  July 17, 1987

     By The Commission:


                             I.  INTRODUCTION

          1.   In 1983 we adopted a comprehensive "access charge" plan
     for the recovery by local exchange carriers (LECs) of the costs
     associated with the organization and termination of interstate
     calls.1  At that time, we concluded that the immediate applica-
     FidoNews 4-36                Page 4                   21 Sep 1987


     tion of this plan to certain providers of interstate services
     might unduly burden their operations and cause disruptions in
     provision of service to the public.  Therefore, we granted
     temporary exemptions from payment of access charges to certain
     classes of exchange access users, including enhanced service
     providers.  Three years later, in the Second Report and Order in
     CC Docket No. 86-1, in which we eliminated the exemption for

     resale carriers, we announced our intention to reexamine the
     exemption granted to enhanced service providers after our
     consideration of certain related issues in the Computer III
     proceeding.2  We recently completed that consideration.3  We
     issue this Notice of Proposed Rule Making to consider whether
     interstate access charges should be assessed on enhanced service
     providers.  We tentatively conclude that it is now appropriate
     that enhanced service providers, like providers of interstate
     basic services, be assessed access charges for their use of local
     exchange facilities, and we propose amendments to our rules to
     accomplish that end.

                              II.  BACKGROUND


          2.  In the access charge proceeding, the first of our four
     primary goals was the "elimination of unreasonable discrimination
     and undue preferences among rates for interstate services."4
     Specifically, our objective has been to distribute the costs of
     exchange access in a fair and reasonable manner among all users
     of exchange access service, irrespective of their designation as
     carriers, non-carrier service providers, or private customers.5
     We noted in 1983 that although many entities used exchange access
     service, some were paying local business rates.6  We endeavored
     to establish a more equitable sharing of costs, and initially
     intended to impose interstate access charges on enhanced service
     providers for their use of local exchange facilities to originate
     and terminate their interstate offerings.7  Interstate enhanced
     services often use common lines and local exchange switches in
     the same manner as MTS and some MTS equivalent services.  To the
     extent that this is the case, we concluded that equity and
     efficiency require that those enhanced service providers pay the
     same charges for exchange access.

          3.  In the discussion of the application of access charges
     to enhanced service providers in the First Reconsideration, we
     said that we wanted to develop a rate structure under which all
     exchange access users were charged on the same basis.8  In the
     pre-access charge environment, facilities-based interstate
     carriers other than AT&T (other common carriers or OCCs) were
     paying carrier-type access charges in the form of ENFIA rates,
     while WATS resellers, enhanced service providers, and shares were
     paying much lower local business rates.9  Despite our resolve to
     distribute the costs of exchange access among all users of access
     service, we recognized that the immediate imposition of inter-
     state access charges on all users of exchange access would have
     some undesirable consequences.  For example, we said that because
     WATS resellers and enhanced service providers were currently
     FidoNews 4-36                Page 5                   21 Sep 1987


     paying local business rates for their interstate access, the
     immediate imposition of interstate access charges would have a
     substantial and sudden impact on their costs, which could
     undermine their ability to continue to provide service while they

     were adjusting their operations in response to the new access
     charge rules.10

          4.  Because of these concerns about rate shock, we exempted
     certain exchange access users from the payment of certain
     interstate access charges in the First Reconsideration.11  At
     that time, we did not intend those exemptions to be permanent,12
     and we have since eliminated several of them.  For example, in CC
     Docket No. 86-1, we considered the question of access charge
     exemptions for resellers.  In the First Report and Order in that
     docket, we eliminated the exemptions from all access charges for
     WATS resellers and from traffic-sensitive access charges for MTS
     resellers, on the grounds that these exemptions were uneconomic
     and inequitable and could no longer be supported by a rate shock
     rationale.13  We said there that our goal was to promote
     competition, not to protect competitors, and we regarded the
     elimination of the exemptions as another step toward an
     economically rational pricing scheme.14

          5.  In the 86-1 Second Report and Order, we eliminated the
     exemption for private line resellers that offer non-MTS/WATS
     services, which are, in general, data and telex carriers.  In
     that order, we said that data and telex carriers, like carriers
     offering MTS/WATS-type services, use local exchange facilities to
     originate and terminate interstate traffic and should pay the
     same charges as those assessed on other interexchange carriers
     for their use of the same facilities.15  We also noted that our
     purpose in adopting the exemption for data and telex carriers in
     the first place had been to grant transitional rather than
     permanent relief.16  Finally, we said that our decisions to apply
     access charges to these resellers, as well as to resellers of MTS
     and WATS, represented another step toward our objective of
     distributing the costs of exchange access service in a fair and
     reasonable manner.17


                 III.  THE PROPOSED CHANGES IN THE ACCESS
                   CHARGE TREATMENT OF ENHANCED SERVICE
                                 PROVIDERS

          6.  When we modified our access charge plan in the First
     Reconsideration, we granted enhanced service providers an
     exemption from the payment of such charges because we were
     concerned about rate shock.  We feared that if we imposed full
     interstate access charges on enhanced service providers, which
     were then paying local business rates for their interstate
     access, they would face large increases in their operating costs
     and might no longer be viable.18  Therefore, instead of
     immediately applying access charges to enhanced service
     providers, we decided to fashion a transition plan to avoid the
     severe rate impact of assessing such charges at the outset.19  As
     FidoNews 4-36                Page 6                   21 Sep 1987


     a result, enhanced service providers currently pay local business
     rates and subscriber line charges for their switched access
     connections to local exchange company central offices.20

          7.  We are concerned that the charges currently paid by
     enhanced service providers do not contribute sufficiently to the
     costs of the exchange access facilities they use in offering
     their services to the public.  As we have frequently emphasized
     in our various access charge orders, our ultimate objective is to
     establish a set of rules that provide for recovery of the costs
     of exchange access used in interstate service in a fair,
     reasonable, and efficient manner from all users of access
     service, regardless of their designation as carriers, enhanced
     service providers, or private customers.21  Enhanced service
     providers, like facilities-based interexchange carriers and
     resellers, use the local network to provide interstate services.
     To the extent that they are exempt from access charges, the other
     users of exchange access pay a disproportionate share of the
     costs of the local exchange that access charges are designed to
     cover.

          8.  As we stated in the Notice initiating the CC Docket
     No. 86-1 proceeding, "concerns with 'rate shock' cannot sustain
     an uneconomic pricing structure in perpetuity."22  Accordingly,
     in previous orders in that docket, we have concluded that such
     concerns no longer justify providing WATS resellers or resellers
     of other services with exemptions from access charges.
     Similarly, we tentatively conclude today that a rate shock
     rationale no longer justifies an access charge exemption for
     enhanced service providers.  Enhanced service providers have had
     ample notice of our ultimate intent to apply interstate access
     charges to their operations and ample opportunity to adjust their
     planning accordingly.23  We discussed our intent to impose access
     charges on enhanced service providers almost four years ago in
     the First Reconsideration in CC Docket No. 78-72.24  The access
     charge plan itself has now been in place for almost three years.
     Moreover, in the Second Report and Order in CC Docket No. 86-1,
     we stated that after the resolution of certain issues with regard
     to enhanced service providers in Computer III, we would consider
     initiating a further Rule Making to consider the application of
     access charges to enhanced service providers.  Furthermore, we
     propose that the application of access charges to enhanced
     service providers become effective on January 1, 1988.  This
     should provide additional time for enhanced service providers to
     incorporate this change into their business planning.  In sum,
     concerns over rate shock may justify a temporary, but not a
     permanent, exemption, and it now appears to us that the temporary
     period during which an access charge exemption was appropriate
     has lapsed.

          9.  In addition, the financial impact on enhanced service
     providers from the imposition of interstate access charges will
     be substantially smaller than it would have been at the time of
     the implementation of the access charge plan and will decrease in
     the immediate future.  As the end user contribution to common
     line costs through subscriber line charges increases, the
     FidoNews 4-36                Page 7                   21 Sep 1987


     contribution from carriers and enhanced service providers through
     carrier common line (CCL) charges decreases.  In May of 1984, the
     CCL charge for both originating and terminating traffic was 5.24
     cents per minute of use.25  Currently, the terminating charge is
     4.33 cents per minute of use, and the originating charge is .69
     cents per minute.  This decline in CCL charges represents a
     sizeable drop in the costs of interstate access charges, and will
     mitigate the impact of the imposition of those charges on
     enhanced service providers.  With additional increases in
     subscriber line charges scheduled for December 1988 and April
     1989, the CCL charge for both originating and terminating traffic
     should decrease even further.26  We are aware that, under our
     rules, many enhanced service providers would be assessed
     terminating CCL charges.27

          10.  Parties are free to comment upon our tentative conclu-
     sions about rate shock.  Such comments should be accompanied by
     detailed data supporting the arguments advanced therein.
     Commenters addressing the rate shock issue should provide
     information on network configurations used by enhanced service
     providers and possible reconfigurations, as well as data on
     industry rates, revenues, and growth rates going back at least
     five years (which would include a period prior to the adoption of
     our access charge plan).  For example, we request comment on the
     types of interstate transmission and exchange access facilities
     that enhanced service providers are currently using, and on the
     types of enhanced service providers that would be affected by the
     elimination of the exemption from interstate access charges.
     Parties should also discuss ways in which affected enhanced
     service providers might reconfigure their networks in response to
     rule changes of the kind proposed.  In addition, we request
     comment on the rates that enhanced service providers have charged
     customers, as well as on industry revenues during that period.
     If possible, commenters should provide data on the demand for
     services and the revenues in the entire enhanced service provider
     sector (including, but not limited to, the value added networks
     and data base services), and on the possible effect of the
     proposed rule changes on demand and revenues.  Finally,
     commenters should provide information on the growth rates of the
     various segments of the enhanced services industry, and the way
     in which those growth rates might be affected by the proposed
     rule changes.  To the extent that a commenter proposes that
     application of access charges to enhanced service providers be
     implemented on a date later than January 1, 1988, such proposal
     should present specific arguments justifying the continuation of
     the current special treatment of enhanced service providers for
     the extended period.28


          11.  In addition, we request comment on issues involving
     implementation of the proposal to assess interstate access
     charges on enhanced service providers.  We invite parties to
     comment on the method of determining interstate and intrastate
     usage of enhanced services for access charge billing.  Parties
     that address the measurement issue are requested to comment on
     the possibility of using the Entry/Exit Surrogate (EES) method
     FidoNews 4-36                Page 8                   21 Sep 1987


     currently used to estimate jurisdictional usage for Feature Group
     A and Feature Group B services.29  Finally, parties are of course
     free to identify any other implementation problems they think the
     Commission should address prior to applying access charges to
     enhanced service providers and to suggest possible approaches to
     resolving these problems.


                       IV.  PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT


          12.  The proposal contained herein has been analyzed with
     respect to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 and found to
     contain no new or modified form, information collection and/or
     recordkeeping, labeling, disclosure, or record retention
     requirements, and will not increase or decrease burden hours
     imposed on the public.30

                          V.  PROCEDURAL MATTERS

          13.  Pursuant to 47 U.S.C.    154(i), 154(j), 201-05, 218,
     and 403, and 5 U.S.C.  553, NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN of the
     proposed adoption of new or modified rules.31

          14.  All interested persons MAY FILE comments on the issues
     and proposals discussed herein not later than August 24, 1987 and
     replies may be filed not later than September 14, 1987.  In
     accordance with the provisions of Section 1.419 of the
     Commission's Rules, 47 C.F.R.   1.419 an original and five copies
     of all statements, briefs, comments, or replies shall be filed
     with the Federal Communications Commission, Washington, D.C.
     20054 [sic], and all such filings will be available for public
     inspection in the Docket Reference Room at the Commission's
     Washington, D.C. office.  In reaching its decision, the
     Commission may consider information and ideas not contained in
     filings, provided that such information is reduced to writing and
     placed in the public file, and provided that the fact of the
     Commission's reliance on any such information or ideas is noted
     in the Order.

          15.  For purposes of this nonrestricted notice and comment
     Rule Making proceeding, members of the public are advised that ex
     parte contacts are permitted until the time a public notice is
     issued stating that a substantial disposition of the matter is to
     be considered in a forthcoming meeting or until a final order
     disposing of the matter is adopted by the Commission, whichever
     occurs earlier.  In general, an ex parte presentation is any
     written or oral communications (other than formal written
     comments, pleadings, and oral arguments) between a person outside
     the Commission and a Commissioner or a member of the Commission's
     staff that addresses the merits of the proceeding.

          16.  Any person who submits a written ex parte presentation
     must serve a copy of that presentation on the Commission's
     Secretary for inclusion in the public file.  Any person who makes
     an oral ex parte presentation addressing matters not fully
     FidoNews 4-36                Page 9                   21 Sep 1987


     covered in any previously-filed written comments for the
     proceeding must prepare a written summary of that presentation,
     and that written summary must be served on the Commission's
     Secretary for inclusion into the public file, with a copy to the
     Commission official receiving the oral presentation.  Each ex
     parte presentation described above must state on its face that
     Secretary has been served, and must also state by docket number
     the proceeding to which it relates.  See generally, Section
     1.1231 of the Commission's Rule, 47 C.F.R.   1.1231.

     Secretary

                                APPENDIX A

          Part 69 of Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations is

          Part 69 - ACCESS CHARGES

          1.   The authority citation for Part 69 continues to read as
     follows:

          AUTHORITY:  Secs. 4, 201, 202, 203, 205, 218, 403, and 410
     of the Communications Act as amended; 47 U.S.C. 154, 201, 202,
     203, 205, 218, 403, and 410.

          47 CFR Part 69 is amended to read as follows:

          2.   Section 69.2 is amended by revising paragraphs (m) and

          (m)  "End user" means any customer of an interstate or
     foreign telecommunications service that is not a carrier or an
     enhanced service provider except that a carrier other than a
     telephone company or an enhanced service provider shall be deemed
     to be an "end user" when such carrier or enhanced service
     provider uses a telecommunications service for administrative
     purposes and a person or entity that offers telecommunications
     services exclusively as a reseller shall be deemed to be an "end
     user" if all resale transmissions offered by such reseller
     originate on the premises of such reseller;

                                 * * * * *

          (gg) "Access minutes" or "access minutes of use" is that
     usage of exchange facilities in interstate or foreign service for
     the purpose of calculating chargeable usage.  On the originating
     end of an interstate or foreign call, usage is to be measured
     from the time the originating end user's call is delivered by the
     FidoNews 4-36                Page 10                  21 Sep 1987


     telephone company and acknowledged as received by the
     interexchange carrier or enhanced service provider's facilities
     connected with the originating exchange.  On the terminating end
     of an interstate or foreign call, usage is to be measured from
     the time the call is received by the end user in the terminating
     exchange.  Timing of usage at both the originating and
     terminating end of an interstate of [sic] foreign call shall
     terminate when the calling or called party disconnects, whichever
     event is recognized first in the originating and terminating end
     exchanges, as applicable.

                                 * * * * *

          (nn) "Enhanced service provider" means a person providing
     "enhanced services" as defined in Section 64.702(a) of these
     rules.

          3.   Section 69.5 is amended by revising paragraph (b) to
     read as follows:


            69.5 Persons to be assessed.

                                 * * * * *

          (b)  Carrier's carrier charges shall be computed and
     assessed upon all interexchange carriers or enhanced service
     providers that use local exchange switching facilities for the
     provision of interstate or foreign telecommunications services or
     enhanced services.

                                 * * * * *

          4.   Section 69.105 is amended by revising paragraphs (a)
     and (c) to read as follows:

           69.105 Carrier common line.

               (a)  A charge that is expressed in dollars and cents
     per access minute of use shall be assessed upon all interexchange
     carriers or enhanced service providers that use local exchange
     common line facilities for the provision of interstate or foreign
     telecommunications services or enhanced services.

                                 * * * * *

               (c)  Any interexchange carrier or enhanced service
     provider providing interstate or foreign telecommunications
     services or enhanced services shall receive a credit for Carrier
     Common Line charges to the extent that it resells services for
     which these charges have already been assessed (e.g., MTS or MTS-
     type service of other common carriers).

          5.   Section 69.106 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) to
     read as follows:

     FidoNews 4-36                Page 11                  21 Sep 1987


           69.106 Line termination.

               (a)  A charge that is expressed in dollars and cents
     per access minute shall be assessed upon all interexchange
     carriers or enhanced service providers that use local exchange

     carriers or enhanced service providers that use local exchange
     switching facilities for the provision of interstate of foreign
     telecommunications or enhanced services.

                                 * * * * *

     read as follows:

           69.108 Intercept.

               (a)  A charge that is expressed in dollars and cents

     carriers or enhanced service providers that use local exchange
     switching facilities for the provision of interstate or foreign
     telecommunications or enhanced services.

                                 * * * * *

     read as follows:

           69.111 Common transport.

               (a)  A charge that is expressed in dollar and cents per
     access minute shall be assessed upon all interexchange carriers
     or enhanced service providers that use switching or transmission
     facilities that are apportioned to the Common Transport element
     for purposes of apportioning net investment.

                                 * * * * *


          9.   Section 69.112 is amended by revising paragraphs (b)(1)
     and (c) to read as follows:

           69.112 Dedicated transport.

                                 * * * * *

               (b)  Appropriate subelements shall be established for
     the use of interface arrangements.  Charges for such subelements
     shall be assessed and computed as follows:  (1) Such charges
     shall be assessed upon all interexchange carriers or enhanced
     service providers for the interface arrangements they use to
     provide interstate or foreign telecommunications or enhanced
     ervices:
               (c)  A charge for the use of voice grade transmission
     facilities shall be assessed upon interexchange carriers or
     enhanced service providers that use such facilities to provide
     interstate or foreign telecommunications or enhanced services.
     Such charges shall be expressed in dollars and services.  Such
     charges shall be expressed in dollars and cents per unit of
     capacity.  Total units of capacity provided to an interexchange
     carrier or enhanced service provider shall be measured by
     ascertaining the number of conversations that could be
     transmitted simultaneously without producing blocking in the
     dedicated transport facilities.  The capacity unit charge for
     carriers that offer MTS shall be weighted by a distance factor
     that reflects the airline distance between the entry switch and
     the interexchange facility.  The capacity unit charged for other
     carriers or enhanced service providers shall be weighted by a
     distance between the entry switch and the interexchange facility
     or the airline distance between the entry switch and any
     interexchange facility of carriers that offer MTS that is located
     within 5 miles of such carrier or enhanced service provider's
     interexchange facility.

     No. 85-229, FCC 87-102 (released May 22, 1987) (hereinafter Phase
     II Order).  That decision had the effect of continuing to exempt
     from access charges a major class of service providers -- the
     VANs (value added network providers), which offer protocol
     processing combined with packet-switched data services.  See
     Amendment of Sections 64702 of the Commission's Rules and
     Regulations (Third Computer Inquiry), Supplemental Notice of

     Commission's Rules, Report and Order, CC Docket 86-1, FCC 86-115,
     paras. 26-27 (released March 21, 1986) (hereinafter First Report
     and Order).  To the extent enhanced service providers resell MTS
     or MTS-equivalent services in offering their services, we propose
     that they be treated like MTS resellers -- that is, that they be
     assessed the traffic-sensitive access elements, but not the
     carrier common line charge.  See infra Appendix section
     69.105(c).

     14.  Id. at para. 26.  The amendment of the rule deleting the
     exemption for WATS resellers became effective June 1, 1986.  We
     also provided a short transition period for WATS resellers.  The
     rule changes applied as of June 1, 1986, to all traffic on resold
     WATS lines put in service after the order was adopted.  For
     traffic carried on resold WATS lines already in service as of the
     adoption date of the order, we required resellers to pay all
     traffic-sensitive access charges, effective June 1, 1986, but
     deferred their payment of carrier common line charges until
     January 1, 1987.

     15.  Second Report and Order, supra note 2, at para. 11.  The
     amendment of the rule deleting the exemption for non-MTS/WATS
     resellers became effective January 1, 1987.

     providers are not carriers, they are treated as end users for the
     purposes of Part 69.  See 47 C.F.R.   69.2(m).  To the extent
     that they purchase special access, enhanced service providers
     also pay special access surcharges.  47 C.F.R.   69.5(c).

     25.   MTS and WATS Market Structure, Amendment of Part 67 of the
     Commission's Rules and Establishment of a Joint Board.
     Recommended Decision and Order, CC Docket Nos. 78-72 and 80-286,
     FCC 87J.1, para 43 (released March 31, 1987) (hereinafter
     Recommended Decision and Order).

     26.   MTS and WATS Market Structure, Amendment of Part 67 of the
     Commission's Rules and Establishment of a Joint Board, Report and
     Order, CC Docket Nos. 78-72 and 80-286.  FCC 87-133 (released
     May 19, 1987).  On July 1, the subscriber line charge cap
     increased from $2.00 to $2.60; the charge is scheduled to
     increase in December 1988 to $3.20; and in April 1989 to $3.50
     per month.  In addition to the direct reduction in CCL charges
     from the implementation of SLC's the associated stimulation of
     usage of the network will further reduce such charges.  Enhanced
     service providers would of course also pay traffic sensitive
     charges.  Although these charges vary by jurisdiction, the
     average nationwide traffic sensitive rate is currently 3.12 cents
     per access minute of use.  See Tier I Tariff Review Plan (from
     October 3, 1986 tariffs).

     27.  Many enhanced services are provided pursuant to a network
     configuration in which a call originates over an "open" end and
     terminates over a "closed" end.  Our rules provide that
     terminating CCL charges apply on the "open" end where a call has
     only such end.  CCL charges are not assessed on "closed" ends of
     calls.  See First Report and Order, supra note 13, paras. 50-53:
     see also 47 C.F.R.   69.207.

     28.  We note that the application of full access charges to WATS
     resellers was accomplished pursuant to a modest phase-in.  See
     First Report and Order, supra note 13, at para. 2.  In that
     instance, however, we concluded that a phase-in was warranted
     because of another significant change in our access charge plan,
     that is, inclusion of WATS closed end lines in the special access
     category, that was made concurrently with our decision to remove
     the resellers' exemption.  Similar circumstances do not appear to
     exist in the instant situation.


     29.  This Commission has generally provided for the use of this
     surrogate pending a decision by the Federal/State Joint Board in
     CC Docket No. 85-124.  See Determination of Interstate and
     Intrastate Usage of Feature Group A and Feature Group B Access
     Service, Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rule Making, CC Docket

     No. 85-124 (released December 9, 1986).  That Joint Board is
     considering a permanent resolution for the proper allocation of
     costs and revenues between the state and federal jurisdictions
     for FGA and FGB.


     30.  We hereby certify that the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5
     U.S.C.   60-612(1982), is not applicable to this proceeding.  We
     have previously determined that the formal provisions of the
     Regulatory Flexibility Act are not applicable to proceedings to
     adopt or revise access charge rules because local exchange
     carriers, the parties directly subject to the access charge
     rules, do not fall within the Act's definition of a small entity.
     Id. sec. 601.  See Mid-Tex Electric Cooperative, Inc. v. FERC,
     773 F.2d 327 (D.C. Cir. 1985); Notice at para. 33, n. 54; and MTS
     and WATS Market Structure, Third Report and Order, 93 FCC 2d 241,
     paras. 358-62 (1983).  While we have not applied the formal
     procedures of the Regulatory Flexibility Act in this proceeding,
     we have considered and will consider the effects of the rule
     changes on enhanced service providers, some of which are small
     businesses, just as we considered the effects of rule changes on

     resellers in CC Docket No. 86-1.  We will also consider the
     impact of rule changes upon small telephone companies.  See WATS
     Related and Other Amendments of Part 69, Memorandum Opinion and
     Order, para. 29, CC Docket No. 86-1 (released January 15, 1987).
     In accordance with the provisions of section 605 of the
     Regulatory Flexibility Act, a copy of this certification will be
     sent to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business
     Administration at the time of publication of this NPRM in the
     Federal Register.


     31.  If we adopt the rules proposed in Amendment of Part 69 of

                       Fido v12 (tm) Echo Conference

     An echomail conference has been established  for  sysops  running
     Fido  v12.  The  conference is intended to provide support and an
     exchange of ideas amongst the users of the software (sysops)  and
     the  developers.  Tom  Jennings  has  agreed to participate,  and
     messages will be echoed to the beta testers as well.

     143/8 will coordinate the echo.  I am looking  for  a  number  of
     nodes in PC Pursuit cities to establish direct links for the echo
     in order to optimize distribution. If you would be willing to act
     as a direct link in the distribution of this echo, please contact
     me at 143/8.

     I have been told the Region 1 BUG nodes (1:1/98,  1:1/99) will no
     longer support prior versions of Fido.  With the advent  of  this
     echo,  support  for v12 should be more than adequate.  Anyone who
     wants more technical support than this should  probably  purchase
     the software directly from Fido Software at the commercial price.

     In  addition  to  providing  a  forum  for  technical discussions
     relating to v12,  the echo will serve as a method  of  announcing
     utilities,  upgrades,  and  so  on.  Anyone  intending  to  write
     software in support of Fido  v12  would  be  most  welcome  as  a
     participant.  I  do think it necessary to limit access to sysops,
     though.  I for one don't want my casual caller to  read  anything
     which might give him/her any creative ideas!

     Well,  that's  it.  A  netmail  message  to  143/8,  and a little
     patience, is about all it will take to link in.  By the way,  the
     scan name of the conference is FIDO (used with TJ's permission, I
     hope).

     Using FIDO-FAM Ver 3 with OPUS Ver 1            by Dennis Glaeser

     Problem:   When attempting to run FIDO-FAM under the Outside
       #1       function of OPUS the program terminates with:

                       Run-time error 10, PC=xxxx
                       Program aborted

     Solution:  Create FAMOPT and FAMOVL environment strings. The
                FAMOVL string must be the path which contains the
                FIDO-FAM.00? files. The FAMOPT string should contain
                any command line options desired. The FAMOPT string
                can contain junk, in case no default options are
                desired, but the string must contain something (or DOS
                will remove the name from the environment).

     Reason:    The 'local' environment handed to FIDO-FAM is not
                terminated properly. FIDO-FAM is looking for its
                environment names until it finds them, or it reaches
                the end of the environment. Outside the 'legitimate'
                environment the data is trash, and the program fails
                trying to build an illegally long environment name.
                This solution simply assures that FIDO-FAM will stop
                looking within the real environment area.

     -----------------------------------------------------------------

     Problem:   FILES.BBS contains ANSI control sequences in some
       #2       comment lines, but does not display properly. There
                are stange 'Missing' files that appear in the FIDO-FAM
                display.

     Solution:  On each (comment) line which begins with an ESC char,
                put a space before the ESC char.

     Reason:    FIDO-FAM is treating the ESC sequence as a file name.
                Recall that a comment line is one that begins with:
                  1) a space  2) a dash, or 3) the '@ 'char
                Anything else (including the ESC char) means the line
                represents a file name.

     Note:      Future versions of FIDO-FAM will recognize the ESC
                char as a comment line. This solution is a near term
                work-around.

                If the FILES.BBS contains an ANSI clear screen command
                (ESC [2J) the header and footer displays in FIDO-FAM
                are lost. It would make FIDO-FAM unacceptably slow
                (especially remote) to constantly repaint those lines.
                Therefore it is highly recommended to not use the ANSI
                clear screen command in a FILES.BBS

     -----------------------------------------------------------------

     Problem:   FILES.BBS contains ANSI control sequences, and lines
       #3       are truncated after processing by FIDO-FAM.
     FidoNews 4-36                Page 18                  21 Sep 1987


     Solution:  None. The only way to get what you expect is to reduce
                the length of the line (either remove the ANSI
                sequences or reduce the length of the displayed chars).

     Reason:    FIDO-FAM doesn't do ANSI (yet). The length of a line
                is truncated to assure that lines do not wrap around
                when being displayed by the BBS program. Unfortunately
                the 'non displayed' chars are counted just the same as
                displayed ones.

     Note:      Future versions of FIDO-FAM will not truncate any
                lines which contain an ESC character. The user will be
                responsible to see that the display does not wrap.

     -----------------------------------------------------------------

     Problem:   FILES.BBS contains ANSI control sequences, and editing
       #4       lines with ANSI commands (with the Edit command)
                creates unpredictable results.

     Solution:  None. Don't use FIDO-FAM Ver 3 to edit lines which
                contain ANSI sequences.

     Reason:    FIDO-FAM doesn't do ANSI (yet).

     Note:      It is unclear yet to what extent FIDO-FAM will support
                editing of lines containing ANSI commands. Any
                comments and/or suggestions from users are welcomed.

     107/246 Gene Coppola

                      Security Available For Mail Now

     With the rash of SCOTT TISSUE type messages and the purloining of
     mail packets going on it seems that it might  be  wise  to  start
     protecting both EchoMail and mail packets by protecting them with
     passwords.

     SEAdog  4.1  as  well as Confmail and Opus all allow some type of
     password  protection.  But  that  is  also  the  problem  as  the
     selection   of   passwords   can  become  a  critical  and  often
     interesting problem.

     For example,  one Sysop in our Net uses his name for mail  pickup
     password protection. Another Sysop I know uses his type of car as
     a password.  Great idea,  but any decent hacker could crack those
     passwords in minutes.

     Many studies have show that the only truly safe password  is  one
     selected or generated if you will by truly random methods. As the
     size  of  the  password  gets  bigger  a RANDOM password provides
     greater security.

     So,  how do I select a RANDOM password?  Well you could just poke
     some keys blindfolded, and it might be random, however there is a
     much better method.

     With  the  help  of  a program called GENERATE.EXE you may create
     truly random passwords based on the latest  Bureau  of  Standards
     specifications for secure password generation.

     GENERATE.EXE  does not access any BBS files,  and generates truly
     random passwords based on a combination of variables,  some input
     by you, and some read directly from the system itself.

     In  a  recent  test run over a 72 hour period the program DID NOT
     create any duplicate passwords.  Over 10 million  passwords  were
     generated  during  this  test.  The  test was run on an IBM PS/80
     under OS/2.  The program also runs on true IBM PC's,  XT's,  AT's
     and  100% compatibles and provides comparable results,  with less
     speed!

     Once you have generated the passwords you wish to use,  the  next
     step  would  be to read the documentation for the mail,  archive,
     and  toss/scan  utilities  to  see  how  to  implement   password
     protection. Then contact the Sysops you send/receive mail from on
     a  regular  basis,  and decide how you wish to implement password
     protection.

     While password protection IS NOT the  ultimate  answer,  it  will
     make  it  harder  for  the  hackers  and SCOTT TISSUE types to do
     anything to disrupt the mail flow.

     If a caller uploads or mails you a packet he should not have, and
     it has not been encrypted with the proper password,  it will  not
     FidoNews 4-36                Page 20                  21 Sep 1987


     be  processed  by  the  system.  If someone calls in and tries to
     purloin your mail packets and  you  have  them  set  for  pick-up
     protection  by  password,  he  will  not  be  able  to  get them.
     Eventually he will give up although I grant you it might  take  a
     while.

     GENERATE.EXE  in  combination with SEAdog 4.1 and Confmail,  is a
     very effective combination to provide security  for  your  system
     when all three are used properly.

     This  program  is released to the Sysops for use on their systems
     providing NO attempt is made to reverse compile or otherwise view
     or modify the program.  It is FREEWARE and NO  contributions  are
     expected  for  the software.  Support will be given directly from
     107/246.  If you have any questions or problems contact  us  with
     those questions and/or problems.

     The  source  code for GENERATE.EXE will NOT be released to anyone
     for any purpose.  Furthermore,  this program IS NOT available  to
     Sysops  outside  of  the  UNITED  STATES.  A  version  for export
     (GENROUT.ARC) is now available to anyone who needs one outside of
     the United States.

     You may request/download GENROUT.ARC from 107/246 directly.  This
     is  the  EXPORT version and is slightly less secure than the full
     version.  Netmail  messages  to  107/246  for  the  full  version
     available ONLY to systems within the United States.

     In  my humble opinion,  any program of this nature which does not
     have these restrictions  IS  NOT  worth  the  time  it  takes  to
     download.  Just  like  SUPERKEY  from Borland,  there are certain
     restrictions that must be made if you  desire  to  use  the  full
     Bureau of Standards requirements.

     This  program  has  been  in development for over 6 months and we
     welcome your comments on its use to you.

     Ben Mann / Amnon Nissan
     OPUS 151/1000

               [R]aleigh,NC [E]chomail [D]ata [CON]centrator

        Net 151 in region 18 has been  a  busy  place  from  the  very
     start.  Getting  the  most from our HUBS means changing the ROUTE
     files all the time.

        At a meeting  last  summer  of  the  NC  SYSOP's  we  let  the
     conversation  drift  towards  the  management  of  net  mail  and
     echomail.  After dismissing the possibility of  using  the  space
     shuttle  as  a  bounce  point for out new lazer communicator,  we
     talked about a data concentrator that would service the net.

        The problem was to service the nodes that couldn't get  to  PC
     PURSUIT lines and still provide service to those who could.

        What has come of this initial idea is REDCON.  A Turbo-AT with
     30 meg.  HD, 1 meg.  RAM,  floppy drive and a TeleBit Trailblazer
     9600  baud  modem.  It  is  situated in Raleigh,  NC (919),  a PC
     PURSUIT city.  It is devoted to ECHOMAIL,  with the exception  of
     some  net  151 traffic and the latest node*.* and fnews*.arc.  We
     plan to have all ECHOMAIL,  from ALL the ECHO's,  on  the  system
     bundled  and ready at all times.  This means one place to call to
     get it all.

        But this still doesn't help the non PC PURSUIT  sysops.  So  a
     second data concentrator was added. GEDCON.

         [G]reensboro,NC [E]chomail [D]ata [CON]centrator

        It is a Turbo-AT with 30 meg.  HD, 1 meg RAM, floppy drive and
     a TeleBit Trailblazer 9600 baud  modem.  It  is  connected  to  a
     national out WATS. It will send ECHOMAIL to those who do not have
     access to PC PURSUIT. Again one call does it all.

        To  those  who  wish to use either of these data concentrators
     send netmail to Ben Mann at 151/0 or Amnon Nissan at 151/100. The
     REDCON and GEDCON systems are setup as  PRE-REGISTERED  only,  so
     please contact us BEFORE calling.

        GEDCON  is on a out going WATS line so you can't call into it.
     You MUST contact Amnon Nissan or Ben Mann to be registered BEFORE
     the system will call you.

        So there you have it.  Two data  concentrators.  One  handling
     ECHOMAIL  traffic  to  PC PURSUIT users.  The other calling nodes
     that do not have access to PC PURSUIT.

        To other ECHOMAIL BACKBONE(tm) sysops. Please contact us so we
     may better coordinate our efforts to provide ECHOMAIL services to
     the nodes of an even stronger FidoNet.

        A list of the ECHOMAIL handled by REDCON/GEDCON is in  a  file
     REDCON.ARC which may be requested from 151/0 or 151/100.

     Dot Falcon, Co-Sysop of The Falcon's Rock, 109/648


                              REPAIR NIGHTMARE

     This is the story of how our attempts to get the manufacturers of
     our computer to perform  repairs.  ("We"  refers  to  me  and  my
     husband and co-sysop, George Falcon.)

     Our  computer,  an IBM XT clone with two speeds,  had some rather
     subtle  problems  that  we  suspected  were  hardware   problems.
     Several  of  our more knowledgeable friends suggested we might be
     having a problem with the DMA controller.  Also,  our  hard  disk
     was making a screeching noise.  We purchased this computer in May
     of 1986 from PC-Expanders in Bailey's Crossroads, Virginia (about
     half  a mile from the Radisson Mark Hotel in Alexandria where the
     IFNA conference was held),  and have been running it 24  hours  a
     day ever since.  The computer is no longer under warranty, but we
     decided PC-Expanders would still be the best choice to repair it,
     since they manufactured it.

     Trip 1:  We brought the computer back to PC-Expanders.  (Bailey's
     Crossroads is about forty-five minutes  from  our  apartment,  so
     each  trip  consumed  an  hour and a half in travel time,  not to
     mention the time, usually an hour or more,  spent waiting for the
     repairs.)  PC-Expanders  spent  several  hours,  without success,
     attempting to duplicate the problems we'd been having.  Then they
     called and asked us to come in and help demonstrate the  problems
     to them so that they could diagnose them.

     Trip  2:  We  spent  about  and hour and a half demonstrating the
     problems to them.  They had not recognized the  screeching  noise
     from  the  hard  disk,  and  thought we were hearing the fan.  We
     pointed out the noise,  and they said it meant the hard disk  was
     about  to  fail,  and  we would need a new one.  As for the other
     problems,  they suggested perhaps replacing the motherboard would
     help.  They  said the various chips (including those that involve
     the DMA controller) could not be  purchased  separately,  so  the
     entire  motherboard  would have to be replaced.  We agreed to try
     this.  It then took another three weeks  for  their  shipment  of
     motherboards  to  clear  customs  in  Baltimore,  and for them to
     install our new motherboard.

     Trip 3: We picked up our computer with the new motherboard.  When
     we got home, we discovered that our modem wasn't working.

     Trip 4:  We took the computer back and explained that  our  modem
     wasn't working.  They said it was probably a defective modem, and
     since we hadn't bought it from them,  they wouldn't touch it.  We
     didn't believe that our modem had failed by coincidence while  in
     their  shop,  and said we thought it had something to do with the
     installation of the new motherboard.  They investigated, and told
     us that the I/O board they originally sold us had later proved to
     have problems with internal modems.  Again,  we  were  skeptical,
     since  we had been running our bulletin board with that modem and
     that I/O board for two solid  months  with  no  problem,  but  we
     FidoNews 4-36                Page 24                  21 Sep 1987


     agreed  to a new I/O board.  They insisted that such coincidences
     were possible,  and gave us a discount on the  originally  quoted
     price.  (Total cost at this point: over $300).

     Trip  5:  We picked up our computer with the new I/O board in it.
     The modem was working again,  but now  the  keyboard  was  acting
     funny.  Every  so  often,  hitting  the  shift key would hang the
     computer,  or else it would force CAPS LOCK or NUM  LOCK  on,  or
     reverse PgUp and PgDn.

     Trip  6:  PC-Expanders said it sounded like our keyboard might be
     bad.  We were appalled that all our hardware seemed to be failing
     at once -- motherboard, I/O board, hard disk, and keyboard.  They
     lent us one of their keyboards to take home,  just to prove  that
     the  problem was really our keyboard.  We were convinced that our
     keyboard had no problems,  that the problem was somehow caused by
     the new hardware they had installed, but we went along with them.
     We  had exactly the same problems with their keyboard as with our
     own.

     Trip 7:  We returned PC-Expanders' keyboard and told them it  had
     acted  the  same.  PC-Expanders  said  perhaps  it was a software
     problem, in which case they weren't responsible.  We said no,  it
     wasn't a software problem,  because we had never had this problem
     until they installed the new hardware.  They said  perhaps  there
     was  a  defect in the new motherboard,  and they replaced it with
     another new motherboard of the same type.  We went home and found
     that (a) we still had the same keyboard problems,  (b) our  modem
     had  stopped working,  and (c) the power and turbo mode indicator
     lights on the front of the computer no longer  worked.  We  still
     weren't really sure that our original subtle problems had cleared
     up,  since the new problems that were introduced had kept us from
     using any software long enough to find out.

     At this point,  after seven trips to  Bailey's  Crossroads,  each
     trip  introducing  more problems than it solved,  we were fed up.
     We weren't willing to  give  PC-Expanders  any  more  chances  to
     attempt  repairs.  Instead,  we  demanded that they remove all of
     their new hardware,  reinstall all of our old hardware (which  we
     had retained) and give us a full refund, including labor costs.

     Then  things  began  to get ugly.  The service manager refused to
     refund the labor costs, saying, "So in other words,  in regard to
     all  the work we put into your computer,  you're just telling us,
     'Tough luck.'" I said that we  didn't  feel  we  had  gotten  any
     service  at all,  and so in other words,  when it came to getting
     our computer fixed properly,  he was telling us "Tough luck."  He
     finally agreed to our demands on the condition that we would sign
     a release stating that PC-Expanders was no longer responsible for
     the condition of our computer.  We agreed.

     Trip  8:  The  exchange was made.  The service manager told us we
     could not get a refund on the spot,  but a check would be  mailed
     to  us  in  7-10  days.  We  got  a  statement  to that effect in
     writing.  In exchange for that written statement,  we signed  the
     release.

     While  there,  we  asked  them to fix the indicator lights on the
     front of our computer.  They fixed one,  but were unable  to  fix
     the  other  and  refused  to  investigate  it.  Both  the service
     manager and the technician who did all the work on  the  computer
     said,  "You told us that light never worked." We had said nothing
     of the kind, since the light had always worked.

     After we took the computer home,  the hard disk (which  had  been
     removed  and  reinstalled)  no  longer  screeched.  The modem and
     keyboard worked just  fine,  as  they  had  before  PC-Expanders.
     However,  we  did  up  with  another NEW problem,  however -- our
     printer didn't work.  It was hooked up to the only serial port on
     the computer,  but it was now  LPT2  instead  of  LPT1.  We  were
     forced to take the computer to another repairperson, and he found
     that they had forgotten to return one of our ports and the ribbon
     cable  that  connected  it  to  the  graphics  board  inside  the
     computer.  It cost us $60 to repair that.

     We had received the written statement on August 21.  On September
     1 we received the refund check for the full amount.

     So, our bulletin board was down nearly eight weeks, and we're out
     $60, just to get our computer back to nearly the condition it was
     in before PC-Expanders got their hands on it (the turbo indicator
     light is still broken).  We still have not had an accurate  diag-
     nosis  of  the  subtle  problems  we  had before,  and we are now
     waiting to see if those problems manifest themselves again.

     Conclusion:  Although  PC-Expanders  has  been  in  business  for
     several  years,  and has a good reputation among a lot of people,
     and although they have some of the best prices around,  would you
     want to go through this?

                                408-293-7894
                            300/1200/2400 Bauds
                           by Todd Looney - Sysop

          I know a lot  of  you  have  called  the  Vietnam  Veterans'
     Valhalla  in  San Jose,  and a few of you carry the International
     Vietnam Veterans' EchoConference on your own systems.  For  that,
     Nancy and I both want to thank you.

          The  sysops  of  this bulletin board are both Vietnam Combat
     Veterans;  I fought during the war as a Medical Field Surgeon  in
     the  service of my country,  and spent more than my fair share of
     time in a VC/NVA prison camp across the border in Laos, and Nancy
     my wife, who is a veteran of a different sort,  having fought HER
     war years after I had returned to the United States, battling the
     problems I brought back from that little country tucked thousands
     of miles away in Southeast Asia.

          We have, for the most part, conquered all of the problems of
     that  traumatic past through years of hard work!  But many of the
     men and women who returned from that war continue to  carry  it's
     memories and nightmares with them today.  For some,  every day is
     a bitter struggle to survive,  trying to find some way to  either
     escape the horrible memories, or to come to terms with themselves
     so they and their families can begin to live a normal life!!

          Nancy  and  I  feel  it  is our responsibility as caring and
     empathetic individuals to share as much of ourselves as  possible
     with those Vietnam Combat Veterans of both kinds; the ex-military
     soldier-at-arms, and their wives, friends and lovers.  We do this
     with the hope that somehow the  knowledge  and  understanding  we
     gained  from  the years encompassing our own struggle might be of
     some help to those who are still fighting their war!!!

          If you haven't called our system in a while  you're  in  for
     quite  a  surprise.  We've  added a dozen veteran-related message
     areas and plan to add a few more as soon as we can make the right
     resource contacts.

          You might have noticed the "Inc." tacked onto the end of our
     name at the header of this article,  well  that's  another  thing
     that's  happened  to us.  We are in the process of getting a non-
     profit organization from the Internal Revenue  Service  (probably
     the  only thing they've ever given to ANYbody!),  and are working
     out the details of an application for funding which we  will  use
     to try to get working capital so that we can get a lot MORE done.

          Currently we are helping vets get their discharges upgraded,
     get the medals they were awarded but never got, the pensions they
     didn't know they had coming, and, well...anything in general that
     the  veterans  who  call  us for help need.  We work very closely
     with veterans' crisis centers across  the  country,  and  if  you
     haven't  noticed  the  Fido  Newsletter  lately,  we have finally
     syndicated the  International  Vietnam  Veterans'  EchoConference
     FidoNews 4-36                Page 27                  21 Sep 1987


     into  50 BBS systems spanning the entire continent.  That may not
     mean  much  to  the  coordinators  of  the  larger  national  and
     international  echo's,  but  it sure means a lot to us!  At least
     once a month we help a veteran get over a major crisis in his  or
     her  life,  and those two words,  thank you,  make all the bitter
     struggles with the Veterans' Administration and all  those  other
     government bureaucrats more than worth it!

          Soon  we'll  be  able to afford to purchase equipment we can
     use to set  Vet  Centers  up  with  so  their  psychologists  and
     counselors  can  participate  on-line instead of through personal
     meetings.  Soon we'll be able to have money to provide  emergency
     financial  assistance  for  needy  veterans  and  their families.
     Soon, soon....... I do that a lot, I know.  Money doesn't grow on
     trees and "Rome wasn't built in  a  day",  and  all  that.  Well,
     things are happening...slowly but steadily on.

          We  have  plenty  of room for voting members of board at the
     Valhalla.  All you have to do to be qualified is CARE.  It  won't
     cost  you  any  money (can't promise I won't ask once in a while,
     but there's no obligation).  You may have  to  attend  a  meeting
     once  in a while,  but then that's how you can help us figure out
     how to battle the problems we have to deal with.  Not all of them
     require money,  in fact most of the problems require nothing more
     than  simple brain and will power.  And the more brains and wills
     we can put together the easier it will be to get done what  needs
     to be done.

          There  are  several  special  interest groups you might find
     yourselves leaning  toward  if  you  decide  to  join  our  team;
     POW/MIA, Agent Orange, Buddy Search, Employment, Vet Centers, Bui
     Doi (Amerasian children), the Small Business Association, Veteran
     Resources, Veterans Administration liaison, Veterans Organization
     liaison  ......  and  on and on.  As you can see there's a lot to
     do!

          Well, I guess I've rambled enough.  Nancy and I hope to hear
     from you all,  even if it's just to  browse  around  the  Vietnam
     Veterans' Valhalla!

     See ya there!

     Respectfully,
     Todd C. Looney
     President, Vietnam Veterans' Valhalla, Inc.

                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Adding Control To Your Batch Files
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

          Owing to the amount of travelling my job requires, the batch
     file that runs my system is fairly involved,  and entails several
     layers  and  categories  of automated processing to handle things
     when the system is unattended (or  I  am  being  lazy).  Many  of
     these  automated  processes are such that I would like to be able
     to turn them on and off at will depending on the situation (or my
     mood).  On the other hand,  I don't want to spend  half  my  time
     editing  the batch file either.  The solution I have come up with
     is one that works well here,  which some of you might  also  find
     interesting  or  useful.  The  general  approach  is a simple on.
     First,    I   have   a   dedicated   directory   (for    example:
     C:\OPUS\AUTOCTL\)  which  holds  various "switches".  A switch is
     simply a filename of the form:

          <switch_name>.<switch_state>

     where:

          <switch_name>  is the name of the process being
                         controlled

          <switch_state> is either "ON" or "OFF"

     Usually I have the file contain a brief text which explains  what
     the  switch does in order to refresh my memory at a later time in
     case the switch name is not obvious.

     In  my  batch file,  each conditional block of lines (that is,  a
     block of lines which is controlled by a switch file)  looks  like
     this:

       if not exist c:\opus\autoctl\<switch_name>.ON goto <label>
          .
          .
          .
       :<label>

     In  this  way,  a  number of the processes which can be routinely
     handled in my batch file  can  be  enabled  or  disabled  as  the
     situation  warrants,  without  touching the batch file itself (by
     renaming the <switch_name>.ON file to a <switch_name>.OFF  file).
     Activities   such  as  automatically  updating  the  nodelist  as
     nodediffs are  received,  compiling  the  weekly  newsletter  and
     FidoNews 4-36                Page 29                  21 Sep 1987


     shipping  it  out,  updating the BW area megalist and shipping it
     out, pruning message areas, renumbering message areas, generating
     logfile reports, and so on, are all controlled in this manner via
     switches.  When I go away out of town,  I will typically turn off
     those activities which are more likely to encounter problems when
     running unattended due to a variety of reasons, and turn on those
     activities  which I usually like to do manually but which have to
     be  done  automatically  if  I  am  not  here.  In  addition,  to
     facilitate   changing  switch  states  I  have  two  batch  files
     (TURNON.BAT and TURNOFF.BAT) in a pathed directory to allow me to
     simply say something like:

          TURNON NEWSCAN

     These batch files look like this:

     TurnOn.Bat
     ----------

     echo off
     cd c:\opus\autoctl
     c:
     if not exist %1.off goto bad1
     rename %1.off %1.on >nul
     echo %1: Switch enabled
     goto end

     :bad1
     if not exist %1.on goto bad2
     echo %1: Switch is already on
     goto end

     :bad2
     echo %1: Switch does not exist!
     dir
     :end
     cd \opus

     TurnOff.Bat
     -----------

     echo off
     cd c:\opus\autoctl
     c:
     if not exist %1.on goto bad1
     rename %1.on %1.off >nul
     echo %1: Switch disabled
     goto end

     :bad1
     if not exist %1.off goto bad2
     echo %1: Switch is already off
     goto end

     :bad2
     echo %1: Switch does not exist!
     FidoNews 4-36                Page 30                  21 Sep 1987


     dir

     :end
     cd \opus

     If I want to know what the current status of  the  auto  switches
     is, I need merely do a directory of the auto control subdirectory
     and  the  naming  convention makes it immediately clear what's on
     and what is not.  There probably are more sophisticated  ways  to
     do this type of thing but I have found this method of conditional
     control  to  be quite useful and hope that it might be of benefit
     to someone.

                        Issue #3: BBS Individuality
                         Aaron Priven (1:161/1154)

        Back in the good old days,  I was on two  really  good  BBS's.
     One  is  still  around,  but  it is the other that illustrates my
     point.  That  now-gone  one  was  "The  Baudville  City  Limits",
     (before  the  company  "Baudville")  and was run by a 16-year-old
     hacker kid in Silicon Valley on an  Apple  II+  with  two  floppy
     drives.  It was always running out of message space,  was slow as
     the devil and only had -- yes -- 300 baud.

        Why was it my favorite?  One reason was because the sysop came
     across very mature over modem,  particularly compared to some  of
     the  kiddie  boards I had frequented at that time.  But mainly it
     was because it was *BAUDVILLE*  --  it  was  your  average  film-
     western town,  set in Modem Territory.  The sysop was Mayor Mike.
     The main message area was the Gossipers Cafe.  There was a saloon
     (joke area).  E-mail was at "The  Post  Office."  The  statistics
     function  was  "The  Sheriff's Office," and the Yell function was
     the "Mayor's Office." There was a lottery and  a  general  store.
     In  short,  it was FUN to be there -- you were playing "western".
     Even if you didn't read Louis L'Amour or watch John Wayne -- as I
     never have -- it was still fun to imagine oneself there.

        It was the individuality of Baudville that got to me.  It  was
     "Let's  Pretend"  with  modems.  I  admit  it might not seem very
     dignified,  but in a significant way it  was  this  FUN  part  of
     modeming  that  got  me into it in the first place (at least in a
     continuing way).  It was enjoyable.

        Things changed.  Baudville went down a long,  long  time  ago,
     and  the  telephone number has been reassigned.  I haven't seen a
     BBS like it since.

        What happened to that individuality?  I don't  know.  I  found
     other  BBS's  -- a politics board called "DataTech 4:  Cro's Nest
     II" (the one referred to above) and a board run by a  Cro's  user
     called  "TECHNet"  -- but while DT4 came close,  nothing ever had
     that feeling of fun, escapism, and individuality.

        And now, we have ECHOMAIL,  of course.  Now I'm absolutely the
     last  one  to complain about echomail.  I love it that I can send
     messages to Europe and Australia and  everywhere  in  between  at
     someone   else's  expense.   But  ECHOMAIL  breeds  by  its  very
     definition,  sameness.   And  it  is  this  sameness  that  makes
     modeming less *FUN*.

        Modeming turns into a routine, not a hobby.  You call, you log
     on,  you read the new messages,  you check for new files, you log
     off.  It takes no time, and eventually just becomes dull.

        This began long before Echomail,  of course.  The best example
     of  the  whole  phenomenon  is  PC Board BBS software.  The sysop
     can't change it even if he wants to! Everything looks the same --
     FidoNews 4-36                Page 32                  21 Sep 1987


     the sysop can only be 'SYSOP',  all the menus are the  same,  all
     the commands are the same,  all the news files are the same,  all
     the dates are the same,  every PC Board  in  the  country  has  a
     "Sysops"  conference,  and  even the conferences look the same as
     the main message area,  and there can only be 9 of those  --  and
     sysops  are  cautioned  against more than three!  It's just plain
     *boring*!  If PC Board had ECHOMAIL there'd only be  one  big  PC
     Board!

        And Fido (v11,  anyway) isn't much better.  Opus is good,  and
     TBBS is great if you have the money (which  most  people  don't).
     But   the   bigger  problem  remains  --  getting  sysops  to  be
     individual.

        A while back,  there was a message on one of the echos:  "What
     should  I  call my BBS?" I don't have an actual copy of my reply,
     but here's the gist of it:  be  original.  Project  yourself.  Do
     you have a hobby (besides computers)?  Call it that.  Do you have
     a  particular  reason  for the board?  Call it that.  Do you have
     something you really care about?  Call it that.  I've  never  yet
     seen  a  board named after a person.  Call it that.  Whatever you
     do,  don't put in "PC";  don't call it anything ending in "Board"
     or  "Fido"  or  "Opus";  don't  make  the name of the name of any
     computer be the focus ("The Atari Palace," maybe, if you have the
     'trim' in the board be about palaces and not Ataris;  "PC  Land,"
     no).  Be original,  and remember your BBS is a projection of you,
     and of your users.

        And don't, don't stop at the name! Create a world in your BBS!
     If your BBS has a western name, do *EVERYTHING* western!  If it's
     called  "The  Kingdom  of  XT",   then  do   everything   feudal!
     Improvise! Imagine! Create!

        But  there  is  the  final question:  getting it to happen.  I
     guess I'd rather have a boring sysop than  none  at  all.  But  I
     think  many  sysops  get into the sysoping game for other reasons
     than wanting to invent a place of their own -- perhaps they  want
     easier access for themselves, or they want to be *the boss*, or -
     - well who knows.  But I hope some of the boring sysops out there
     find this note and listen to it, and even if they didn't have the
     users really in mind when they started sysoping, they will now.

                                  -------

        I have two sets of apologies to make:  first,  to the BBSs out
     there in Matrixland who already are as imaginative  and  creative
     as  Baudville  and  whom  I did not recognize;  and another to my
     local sysops who do the best they can.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.

        The last thing is that last May I tried to be a  sysop  for  a
     short while,  and failed;  I quit for many reasons,  but the last
     paragraph is in no small way directed at myself.
