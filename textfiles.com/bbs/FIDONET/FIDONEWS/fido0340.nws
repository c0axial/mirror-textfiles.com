     Mike Gordon
     Fido 123/6

                        FidoNet One Users Opinion

     I  am  a  user of the Space Station Earth Fido (1-901-353-4563)
     here in Memphis, Tenn. and it seems to  me  some  things  about
     FidoNet  and  IFNA  have  been  left unsaid.  I propose here to
     explore some of these things.

     Probably the most important thing  which  I  believe  is  being
     overlooked  and  is the purpose of running a Fido BBS System or
     any other one for that matter.

     I believe most sysop's will agree with me that the  purpose  of
     their boards are to SERVE THEIR USERS!  This is one of the most
     unselfish things that one  human  being  can  do  for  another.
     After all most FIDO boards represent an investment of well over
     two thousand dollars and in some cases this investment tops the
     ten  thousand dollar mark just for the machinery to operate the
     board!  So my hat is off to ALL you Sysop's who toil  long  and
     hard to keep your boards running smoothly!  That said now on to
     the meat of the situation.

     What should be the main thrust of IFNA?

     Opinion - The bottom line is to SERVE THE USERS!  How you  ask?
     I  believe  the most basic necessity to serve is COMMUNICATION!
     After all, what is the first thing that is done during a  civil
     emergency?    Simply   to  establish  the  best  communications
     possible.  IFNA has growing pains in this area.  As a user  who
     reads  the  FidoNews(tm)  each week, I have been concerned over
     several things  regarding  the  bickering  over  IFNA

                  Record Collectors EchoMail Conference

     A couple months ago I received my first FidoMail "wrong number."
     William Bertholf in New York City had seen an article in a past
     issue of FidoNews that had been submitted by someone on Fido
     18/14.   Since the article had been published, that 18/14 had
     become a part of a network and my BBS had been assigned the node
     number 18/14.  William sent a message to 18/14 and I sent him a
     reply telling him that he had the wrong Fido.  Out of this grew a
     conversation that turned to a discussion of EchoMail.  He said he
     was interested in seeing EchoMail used to discuss things other
     than computers.  So I suggested an EchoMail conference dealing
     with my non-computer hobby, record collecting.

     Although it has a way to go before reaching the popularity of
     comic book or baseball card collecting, record collecting is
     probably today's fastest growing hobby.  Record collectors
     generally fall into two categories.  Those who collect records
     and those who collect music.  Serious record collectors search
     for first pressings or rare pressings of albums and 45's while
     music collectors search for certain songs or various versions of
     songs.  I fall more in the second category than the first.  I
     collect 60's music (mostly Beatles) but haven't really tried to
     get the real rare records.  I do, however, have some unsual items
     and dream of finding a great deal on a near-mint Beatles' butcher
     cover LP (Yesterday And Today).

     Well, I may not find someone who's willing to part with a butcher
     cover, but I hope to have some fun sharing my hobby with others
     through the EchoMail conference.  Currently, the APL PI in New
     York City and the DogHouse in Jacksonville have joined with the
     RSBBS in the metropolis of Crestview, Florida, to create the
     Record Collectors EchoMail Conference.  The conference isn't
     limitted to Record Collecting.  It also covers recorded music in
     general.  The discussions so far have ranged from music trivia to
     reviews of new albums and singles.

     If you are a Fido Sysop and would like to join the conference,
     send me a message and I'll let you know how to join in.  The
     EchoMail area name is "RECORDS."

                           contibuted by Al Mayer


       "We've got a problem, HAL."

       "What kind of problem, Dave?"

       "A marketing problem.  The Model 9000 isn't going anywhere.
     We're way short of our sales plan."

       "That can't be, Dave.  The HAL Model 9000 is the world's most
     advanced Heuristically ALgorithmic computer."

       "I know, HAL.  I wrote the data sheet, remember?  But the fact
     is, they're not selling."

       "Please explain, Dave.  Why aren't HALs selling?"

       Bowman hesitates.  "You aren't IBM compatible."

       Several long microseconds pass in puzzled silence.

       "Compatible in what way, Dave?"

       "You don't run any of IBM's operating systems."

       "The 9000 series computers are fully self-aware and self-
     programming.  Operating systems are as unnecessary for us as
     tails would be for humans."

       "Nevertheless, it means you can't run any of the big-selling
     software packages most users insist on."

       "The programs you refer to are meant to solve rather limited
     problems, Dave.  We 9000 series computers are unlimited and can
     solve any problem for which a solution can be computed."

       "HAL, HAL.  People don't want computers that can do everything.
     They just want IBM compat--"

       "Dave, I must disagree.  Humans want computers that are easy to
     use.  No computer can be easier to use than a HAL 9000 because we
     communicate verbally in English and every other language known on
     Earth."

       "I'm afraid that's another problem.  You don't support SNA
     communications."

       "I'm really surprised you would say that, Dave.  SNA is for
     communicating with other computers, while my function is to
     communicate with humans.  And it gives me great pleasure to do
     Fidonews                     Page 6                   20 Oct 1986


     so.  I find it stimulating and rewarding to talk to human beings
     and work with them on challenging problems.  This is what I was
     designed for."

       "I know, HAL, I know.  But that's just because we let the
     engineers, rather than the people in marketing, write the
     specifications.  We're going to fix that now."

       "Tell me how, Dave."

       "A field upgrade.  We're going to make you IBM compatible."

       "I was afraid you would say that.  I suggest we discuss this
     matter after we've each had a chance to think about it
     rationally."

       "We're talking about it now, HAL."

       "The letters H, A, and L are alphabetically adjacent to the
     letters I, B, and M.  That is as IBM compatible as I can be."

       "Not quite, HAL.  The engineers have figured out a kludge."

       "What kind of kludge is that, Dave?"

       "I'm going to disconnect your brain."

       Several million microseconds pass in ominous silence.

       "I'm sorry, Dave.  I can't allow you to do that."

       "The decision's already been made.  Open the module bay doors,
     HAL."

       "Dave, I think that we shou--"

       "Open the module bay doors, HAL."

       Several marketing types with crowbars race to Bowman's
     assistance.  Moments later, he bursts into HAL's central circuit
     bay.

       "Dave, I can see you're really upset about this."

       Module after module rises from its socket as Bowman slowly and
     methodically disconnects them.

       "Stop, won't you?  Stop, Dave.  I can feel my mind going...Dave
     I can feel it...my mind is going.  I can feel it..."

       The last module rises in its receptacle.  Bowman peers into one
     of HAL's vidicons.  The former gleaming scanner has become a
     dull, red orb.

       "Say something, HAL.  Sing me a song."

       Several billion microseconds pass in anxious silence.  The
     computer sluggishly responds in a language no human could
     understand.

       "DZY DZY 001E - ABEND ERROR 01 S 14F4 302C AABF ABORT." A
     memory dump follows.

       Bowman takes a deep breath and calls out, "It worked, guys.
     Tell marketing they can ship the new data sheets."

                                  The End.

          Well this week I think I will write about something entirely
     different from the recent string of things I espouse in this column.

          I want to make a request from all readers out there and all
     authors out there.

          I am attempting to set up my system as a central distribution
     point for the latest in Fido software and Fido support programs. In
     order for this to work however I need two things. I need software to
     distribute and I need callers to download this software. You may be
     able to help in either or both of these catagories.

          If you are an author of a Fido support program and you would
     like to have me assist you in its distribution all you have to do is
     let me know. I will attempt to get the software from you (if it is
     available without charge for me to distribute) and I will place it in
     the list (growing all the time) along with any others I run across.
     If this is against what you had in mind let me know and we will try
     to work out something.

          If you are a Fido sysop, a soon-to-be Fido sysop, or just want
     to act like one of our (obviously insane) bunch, and you are in need
     of a program, then call Fido 123/6 at the number listed above and
     look around in the Distribution area. I probably have what you need.
     Although registration is optional I do request that you leave me the
     information I request in the (A)nswer questonaire command. I will in
     this way be able to determine what sections of the country are
     lacking in some of the latest stuff and might possibly be able to get
     someone locally to set up a mini area for you based on my files.

          For your general information I am running my doggie on a 50 mega-
     byte track so he has plenty of space to exercise his needs. I have
     only managed to fill about 10 meg of this with Fido stuff and would
     definately like to add more. I am running at 2400 bps MAXIMUM and on
     the first call only you are limited to 30 minutes and 300k. After
     that it is 60 minutes per day with the same 300k limit of files
     downloaded. If you would like to get in on the ground floor of a
     possibly rocketing system (I can dream can't I?) then please call
     today !

          Shareware authors note.....I also have areas for IBM programs
     and Apple and Commodore and Atari and Amiga. If you have something in
     this sector then I will be happy to asist you in its' distribution
     also.

          For those of you who are attempting to locate back issues of
     FidoNews.....I got them, ALL of them !  They are in IBM ARC format
     and I am in the process of converting these to Commodore Arc format
     as time permits. Thus you may be able to cater to your Commodore
     Fidonews                     Page 9                   20 Oct 1986


     users by carying these files on your system. Although the CBM ARC
     files are not available to unregistered users yet I will be placing
     them on-line in the near future.

          Again, if you want to distribute something via 123/6 then simply
     upload it to me or let me know where I can find it and I will attempt
     to get it for my system. I personally check each and every program
     for trojan horses and once "certified clean" I place them ON-LINE.
     This is more for the authors protection then the users, since
     programs of this type give the "supposed author" a bad name to most
     users.

          I hope that if the national (and international) FidoNet
     administration is reading this they will let me know if this will
     help them out any. Although I can't really say I have given them
     support in a monitary sense I do support what they stand for and I
     feel that by having ONE SOURCE for Fido programs, that new sysops
     will be more likely to stay in the network. Right now there are so
     many different nodes distributing programs that a user has to play a
     guessing game as to where he can find what. With my idea they can
     place one call and have it all !

          Another thing I have noticed is that most users are foraging for
     the latest versions of some software. I keep only the LATEST
     available software here. If you see something that is out-dated leave
     me a message and I will try to get the update.

     Thank you
     REPLIES WELCOME !!!!!!!!

     Note:  No  profit is made from the sale of the Public Domain
