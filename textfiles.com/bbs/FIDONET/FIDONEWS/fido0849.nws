Editorial: Forget it

by Tom Jennings (1:1/1)

Forget it is right. I've got a contract wiring in a new radio station
studio (KKIQ in Walnut Creek CA) that's gotta be on the air on Thursday;
they just laid carpet on Friday. We're working 9AM til midnight every
day til done, so you won't be hearing much from me until another week
passes.

Please see the article on the proposed "Telecommunications Act of 1991".
It's a bad deal for everyone except the RBOCs (Regional Bell Operating
Companies). Write letters to the Usual Suspects who claim to represent
us. Ask 'em what they are doing about it. Ask them for a copy of the
legislation (did you know they're are REQUIRED to do legislative
searches FOR YOU FOR FREE upon request. So request!)

(Obviously the foregoing is of interest to us U.S.ers mainly... if you
don't know about the U.S. phone system, well, it's a long story... it's
in theory "private" not gov't, and it was "deregulated" ("unleashed" is
more like it) and it's a war of euphemistic bloodsuckery from here on
in... guess who's blood.)

To the moderator of comp.org.fidonet :
--------------------------------------

I would like you to distribute this to the people on the fidonet, either
through your newsletter, or an independant mailing.  Many people have
heard the advertising from the baby-bells voicing their opposition to
this bill, and somebody has to set the record straight as to what the
truth is (in why they oppose the bill)...  The passage of this bill is
crucial.  Please give this the widest distribution possible, with the
recommendation that the readers call AND write their congressman with
support for this bill, as the RBOCs (* RBOC == Regional Bell Operating
Companies -- tomj *) are asking people to do (in opposition) of the
bill.

With the recent federal court and supreme court decisions allowing the
bells into the information services marketplace, this bill is the only
thing standing in their way of making an information services monopoly.
Please read the bill, and I'm sure you will agree with me.

Everybody with a modem should read this, as it may effect their future,
and even the future of BBSs and the FidoNet.

 H.R. 3515 -- Transcribed by James D. Bryant II on Nov. 24, 1991
              I have proofed this twice, it should not contain any
              errors or omissions, I can't access my spell checker
              right now, there may be a typo or two somewhere..

 The following document is a full transcription of the
Telecommunications Act of 1991.

 If this bill does not pass, the Regional Bell Operating Companies
(RBOCs) will be able to force all other information services out of
business.

 Please TELL your Congressman and Senators, and all members of the
FidoNews 8-49                  Page 3                       9 Dec 1991


 involved committees to vote YES on this bill.

 The RBOCs have been conducting a massive disinformation campaign on the
radio bashing the sponsers of this bill and saying that if this bill
passes, that the public will not be able to use online information
services leaving the impression on the listener that they are the ONLY
ones that can provide these services.

 This bill will also provide for open competition among phone companies
at    the local level.  This is the second reason that the RBOCs oppose
this    bill.

 The following information is from the SW Bell brochure on the subject :

      "IT SOUNDS EXCITING

           The exciting news is that we already have the
           technology to put these services to work for us
           through the seven regional holding companies --
           Ameritech, Bell Atlantic, BellSouth, NYNEX,
           Pacific Telesis Group, Southwestern Bell Corpora-
           tion, and U.S. West.  Some larger businesses in
           urban areas already use a variety of information
           services.  But, they are not an option for most
           small businesses and the general public.

           That's because making the services available to
           everyone depends on the regional holding companies...."

 Information services depend on cables and switching facilities owned
and
 operated by the RBOCs.  Having them in the industry is a massive
conflict
 of interest.

They want their monopoly back!

The proposed changes are signifigant; they're hacking the Comm. act of
34, some rather basic changes. While it's worded in positive terms
("improve quality of service" and all that rot) the "quality" will be
enhanced for the providers (RBOCs) not us! -- tomj *)

                            Fredric L. Rice
                     The Skeptic Tank, 1:102/901.9

Boys and girls of the Fido Network, we might have a bit of a problem,
and it's a problem that, if apathy can be broken, is easilly placed
out of our need to worry about.

After requesting listings of files available on several FidoNet systems
both locally to mine and among sites around the United States, I find
that we still have -- many of us -- software packages that have not
been placed into the public domain yet are nonetheless still available
for public download. The so-called dirty dozen list of pirated software
packages is being ignored. I was shocked to find that my very own system
had two pirated packages that a little effort on my part uncovered.

Remember back around 1982 when a package by Sega was being distributed
around the network? A hacked package that said, upon power-up, that it
was a Public Domain package yet was none of that and was placed onto
the dirty dozen list. A total bummer because it was such a cool game
that I probably have a copy around here, somewhere, even though it's a
pirated package and I've gone through my floppies looking for pirated
stuff.

FidoNews 8-49                  Page 5                       9 Dec 1991


I have cleaned my Fidos' house if only to protect my ass.

To perhaps half of the systems that I found still to cary known pirated
software package, I sent a note along with some historical comments
about the package they had available. In all cases, however, no note
or comment was returned. After a week or two, after downloading the
files listings again, the majority still had known pirated materials
available for download. Some _had_ removed some of the software.

That's understandable, of course. There is no cause for a sysop these
days to believe anything someone says yet it creates a problem for the
Fido Network: an opening for the telephone concerns to further attack
our public networks while they impose upon us business rates. If all
the opposistion must do is request our file listings and mark those
that are pirated, any court will find us boys and girls to be anything
_but_ a lawfull collection of computer nerds.

And then there is another method of attack that we should guard against.
So many christians, out of a love for their jesus, would have us remove
the pronographic materials from our systems upon pain of lawsuit if
their holy and untried children were ever to be caught panting over a
GIF file displayed on their screens.

There are three things that I did to protect myself that FidoNet SysOps
used to do yet seem to have walked away from a little bit. It's a sound
sequence of protection, I think:

    o Uploads to a file directory that may not be downloaded from
      until it's evaluated by the SysOp and then moved to a public
      area where it may be accessed. It's too easy to plant evidence
      onto our systems and then download it for use against us.

    o Evaluation of software packages currently existing on the
      SysOps system every now and then for pirated materials. It
      shouldn't be needed very often unless information about a
      software package comes to light

    o Validation of all Users (hack-spit) ages before they are
      granted access to certain GIF files. With a suitable comment
      that the files depict sexual activities and should be
      considered art or something.

We must, FidoNet, clean up our act otherwise the commercial mail systems
that provide end-user to end-user mail services will end us for sure. We
are in the way and they'll move heaven and earth to remove _us_.

Fredric Rice.

Now on the Z1 Backbone...The Disney Discussions Conference!
Chris Harrower, 1:270/417

DISNEY...just the mention of the name brings many happy memories.
The first time your parents took you to see Jungle Book...that
trip to Disneyland, when you were finally big enough to ride the
Matterhorn - then screamed the whole time because you wanted to
GET OFF NOW...the first time you rounded the bend, and saw the
Grand Floridian Resort Hotel in all it's splendor and glory at
Walt Disney World, and saw that beautiful hotel...and many more
FidoNews 8-49                  Page 7                       9 Dec 1991


-- Fantasia, Snow White, The Disney/MGM Studios Theme Park, even
Dick Tracy and Arachnophobia...

Now, you can relive all those memories again with the Disney
Discussions conference...a place to remember the old, and keep in
touch with the new. And cover ALL facets of the Disney empire --

THEME PARKS...it all started July 17, 1955 in an orange grove in
Anaheim, California.  A revolution that would shake the world to
it's roots, and begin a vacation empire untouched by anything
before or since.  In October, 1971, in a mosquito infested swamp
outside Kissimmee, Florida, the lock was turned, and, in the
words of Time Magazine, "as a shrine, Walt Disney World is
surpassed only by Kyoto, Mecca, and the Vatican."  13.3 million
people a year visit Walt Disney World.  Then there's Tokyo
Disneyland, and the soon to open Euro Disney Resort.  And you can
learn about them all in the Disney Discussions Conference.  We
have on-going reports on the 20th anniversary celebration of the
Walt Disney World vacation kingdom, answering your questions on
what YOU can expect when you next visit.  We also are working on
having someone in person, reporting on the grand opening of Euro Disney,
this April in Marne-Le-Valle, France!

MOTION PICTURES...the list is endless, and a part of everyone's
childhood (and adulthood!).  From "Steamboat Willie" through the
current critically acclaimed hit "Beauty And The Beast", the
Disney Discussions Conference covers 'em all.  And we talk about
the other studios under the Disney umbrella...Touchstone,
Hollywood Pictures...what would Walt think?

MORE...there's much more to the Disney Discussions
conference...we have "resident experts" who work at Disneyland
and Walt Disney World, who can answer those "inside" questions
you always wanted to ask. We have lifelong collectors and
enthusiasts who can answer (or ask!) even the toughest trivia
question with ease! We talk about software, trading cards, and
anything and everything Disney.

And now, we're available on the Zone One Backbone!  Just ask your
contact to add you, and send me a message when you're up, so we
can "formally welcome" you to the club! Join in the Disney
Discussions conference...you'll be very glad you did.

   Now it's time to say goodbye to all our company...
   ()_()    M - I - C (see you real soon)
    (_)     K - E - Y (Why? Because we love you)
            M - O - U - S - E

(NOTE:  To answer the inevitable question, I am not now, and
never have been an employee of The Walt Disney Company, or any
subsidiary. I have no "vested financial interest" in the
promotion of Disney, but have a life-long love for the work
started by Walter Elias Disney, and this is one way I can say
"thank you" to him.  I started or participate in Disney
conferences on WWIVNet and USENet, and new conferences are
starting soon on RIME and VirtualNet, with more to follow.

Someday, we hope to link them all together somehow...but that's
someday!)
