                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================

     What  a  weekend!  I  just  got  back  from  three  days  in  New
     Hampshire.  Bob  Hartman  (132/101)  hosted  dual meetings of the
     Bylaws Committee and the Technical Standards  Committee,  and  it
     was quite an experience.  [Side note: Thanks, Bob, for a job well
     done!]

     I can't really say that a new day is dawning.  First,  because it
     isn't yet.  Everything that got discussed will take awhile to get
     implemented.  The  technical  stuff  will probably go faster that
     the political stuff, but that's always the case.  But also,  it's
     more like two new days will be dawning at once.

     On  the one side,  we came up with some really nifty techie stuff
     that should have some impact on all of us and how  we  view  this
     thing  we've created.  On the other side,  we've finally launched
     the seeds of an organization  that  will  hopefully  be  able  to
     manage what we are growing into.


     I  really  know  more  about  the  techie side,  since that's the
     committee I was on,  and where I spent my time.  But I did see  a
     little  of the bylaws side.  Mainly from walking through to get a
     drink.  The bylaws guys had a PC with dual monitors, a printer, a
     modem, buckets full of sodas and ice and stuff, and bags and bags
     of munchies.  We techies toughed it out with nothing but too much
     fresh air and too few chairs.


     The technical changes are simple and devious.  I'll frankly admit
     that it looks like a godawful horrible kludge at first.  But  the
     more  I looked at it,  the better it looked.  I'll let Randy Bush
     (122/6) describe it in detail,  since he's the  chairman  of  the
     Technical  Standards  Committee who already has sensitive toes by
     now that don't really need any more tromping on for a bit.

     But briefly put,  we came up with a fairly simple mechanism  that
     will  allow  us  to handle zones,  points,  gateways to different
     networks (like UseNet and  ArpaNet),  echomail,  and  much,  much
     more.  Kludge it may be, but it's simple and straightforward, and
     it  allows  darned near limitless possibilities.  I'd never stick
     my neck out so far as to say that one technical fix can solve all
     present and future needs,  but this one probably comes  close  to
     solving  all  of  the  problems  that we'd ever have been able to
     handle anyway.

     And here's the good news:  The change  will  be  FULLY  backwards
     compatible  with existing software!  It's essentially an extended
     addressing ability that current versions of Fido,  Opus,  SEAdog,
     TBBS,  et al will preserve and transmit without even knowing that
     they're  doing  it.  It  should  even  be  possible  (though  not
     terribly  convenient)  for  you  to enter messages using extended
     addresses with current software.
     Fidonews                     Page 3                   10 Nov 1986


     It'll also be easy for you clonemakers out there to deal with it,
     since you can implement some, all, or none of it, as you wish.


     Now I guess I'd better deal with  the  political  stuff.  Like  I
     said,  I  didn't  see much of it.  But from what I saw,  everyone
     involved took it all quite seriously,  and  was  very  intent  on
     seeing  to it that everyone got a fair shake.  I also gather that
     everyone is going to vote on it before it's  fully  accepted.  So
     if  you  don't  like  it,  vote  it down and we'll lock them in a
     closet until they come up with something better.

     I haven't read the proposed bylaws yet, but I expect to soon.  In
     fact, we have to get cracking on this, since the Colorado Springs
     group only gave us until January first to resolve all of this.  I
     expect to get my copy soon,  and I'll be shipping them  out  with
     FidoNews.  In fact,  next week's issue will probably be a special
     issue containing the proposed bylaws and not much else!

     I'm looking forward to reading what they came up with, even if it
     means wading through the legalese.  I know  all  of  them  seemed
     pretty  satisfied  that they'd found an acceptable compromise.  I
     don't expect it to be perfect;  nothing in this  world  ever  is.
     But  I  know  they were wrangling with some pretty though issues,
     and I'm interested in seeing how they resolved them.


     So keep your eyes open for new software with new features, be
     watching for the proposed bylaws, and above all


                           DON'T FORGET TO VOTE!

     Bill  Roberts  of  the San Francisco DEC PC User's  Group  and  I
     recently  had  a long conversation about CompuServe policies (you
     all know  which  ones  we were discussing!).  He was sufficiently
     interested to take  it  up  with  them;    the  following  is the
     response he received, along with a few of his comments.


                   COMPUSERVE INFORMATION SERVICE
               OFFICIAL STATEMENT ON COPYRIGHT POLICY
                            October 1986

     [Note:    The  following  statement  currently  is  available  on
     CompuServe.  It  appears  to  have  been  produced in response to
     recent questions and criticism  concerning certain ambiguities in
     CompuServe's policy toward "public domain" software uploads.  The
     following  text  may be obtained on  CompuServe  by  entering  GO
     COPYRIGHT at any !  prompt.]

           The  CompuServe Information Service provides more than  400
     online products covering thousands of subject areas to  its  more
     than 300,000 subscribers.

           Material offered  on  the  CompuServe  Information  Service
     originates with a  wide variety of sources, ranging from creative
     public  domain  software  programs  uploaded  by  subscribers  to
     multi-faceted databases provided by large corporations.

           The following information will address  some commonly-asked
     questions about copyright and ownership of material, particularly
     as  it  relates  to  public  domain  information   and  shareware
     programs.

     --WHAT IS A COMPILATION COPYRIGHT?

           CompuServe  has  copyrighted the contents of the CompuServe
     Information  Service  as  a  compilation  copyright, just as many
     magazines and newspapers reserve such a copyright on the contents
     of their publications.  This copyright is held in accordance with
     the 1976 Copyright Act of the United States.

           A compilation  copyright  is  granted  when an organization
     collects information in  a  lawful  way,  adds  value  to it, and
     offers it to others.    In  this case, the CompuServe Information
     Service is a value-added product;    CompuServe  Incorporated has
     committed substantial financial resources to collecting more than
     400 databases and offering them in an  organized,  structured way
     to  a  defined user base through a nationwide  telecommunications
     network.   The compilation copyright is intended to protect  that
     Fidonews                     Page 5                   10 Nov 1986


     substantial investment from unauthorized exploitation.  This does
     NOT mean that CompuServe assumes ownership of individual programs
     and  databases  provided  to  the    system   by  subscribers  or
     information providers.

     --IF I UPLOAD A SOFTWARE PROGRAM I'VE DEVELOPED TO COMPUSERVE, DO
     I STILL RETAIN OWNERSHIP OF THE PROGRAM?

           Yes, you do.  CompuServe's compilation copyright  does  NOT
     supersede individual ownership rights or copyrights to any of the
     material  furnished  to the Service by subscribers or information
     providers.

           For example, a subscriber who creates a program and uploads
     it  to  a  CompuServe forum data library STILL OWNS that program,
     and may  upload  it  to  other  information services and bulletin
     board systems.

           It should be  noted,  however, that CompuServe cannot grant
     any  redistribution  rights  for  materials  copyrighted  by  the
     author, unless specifically authorized to  do so, CompuServe does
     not own the material or the  copyright.    These  rights  must be
     obtained directly from the author.

     --WHAT IS COMPUSERVE'S STANCE TOWARD COPYRIGHTED, PUBLIC  DOMAIN,
     AND SHAREWARE PROGRAMS?

           Each    of    these    types    of  property  have  special
     characteristics, and deserves separate explanation:

           COPYRIGHT.   CompuServe does not allow copyrighted material
     to be placed  on  the  CompuServe Information Service without the
     author's  permission.    Only    the  owner(s)  or  persons  they
     specifically  authorize may upload copyrighted  material  to  the
     Service.  Any subscriber may download  copyrighted  material  for
     their  own  use.    Any  subscriber  may   also  non-commercially
     redistribute  a copyrighted program with the expressed permission
     of the owner or authorized person.  Permission must  be specified
     in  the  document,  on the Service, or must be obtained  directly
     from the author.

           PUBLIC DOMAIN.   Any  subscriber  may  upload public domain
     programs to the Service.    Any  subscriber  may  download public
     domain  programs  for  their  own    use    or   non-commercially
     redistribute a public domain program.

           SHAREWARE.   Only the owner or  an  authorized  person  may
     upload shareware programs.  Any subscriber may download shareware
     programs for their own use, subject to the  terms provided by the
     owner.    Any  subscriber  may  non-commercially  redistribute  a
     shareware  program  subject  to  the  provided  terms  explicitly
     displayed in the software itself, or with permission of the owner
     or authorized person.

     See below for more information about redistribution guidelines.

     --AS  A  COMPUSERVE  SUBSCRIBER, CAN  I  DOWNLOAD  PUBLIC  DOMAIN
     INFORMATION AND SHAREWARE PROGRAMS FOR MY OWN USE FROM COMPUSERVE
     FORUM DATA LIBRARIES?

            Yes,  you  can.  Public domain information  and  shareware
     programs  are  uploaded  to  CompuServe  data libraries by  their
     authors for use by other CompuServe subscribers.

     --MAY  I  DOWNLOAD  PROGRAMS FROM COMPUSERVE FORUM DATA LIBRARIES
     AND SHARE THEM WITH A FRIEND, OR UPLOAD THEM TO  ANOTHER BULLETIN
     BOARD SYSTEM?

            In  keeping  with  the spirit of the development of public
     domain information  and shareware, it is not CompuServe's current
     policy  to  prevent    casual  redistribution  of  this  type  of
     information -- this is  low  volume  and  low  frequency  use  or
     redistribution of information where no commercialism is involved.
     This means that a customer may  download a file and share it with
     others  for no commercial gain -- either  via  a  bulletin  board
     service, diskette, or other means.

            A subscriber may not, however, download a large  number of
     files for redistribution via any means, nor is it  acceptable for
     a  subscriber  to  update  another  bulletin board regularly with
     files obtained from CompuServe.

            It's  important  to  note  that  CompuServe  cannot  grant
     redistribution rights for  programs  clearly  copyrighted  by the
     author, unless specifically authorized to do so.  Such permission
     must be obtained directly from the author of the program.

     --MAY I DOWNLOAD AND RESELL  A  PROGRAM  FROM  A COMPUSERVE FORUM
     DATA LIBRARY?

             Commercial  exploitation  of  material  contained on  the
     CompuServe Information Service is specifically prohibited by  the
     CompuServe  Service  agreement,  to  which each subscriber agrees
     before  being  permitted  to  access  the  Service.    Therefore,
     subscribers cannot  lawfully  download  and  redistribute  public
     information or shareware programs for personal gain.

             In  addition,  mass    redistribution  of  public  domain
     information or shareware is  also  prohibited.  Mass distribution
     is defined as high frequency and/or high volume transfers.

     --WHAT ARE THE PENALTIES FOR  VIOLATING THE COMPILATION COPYRIGHT
     OR SERVICE AGREEMENT PROVISIONS?

             When  a  situation involving exploitation is  brought  to
     CompuServe's attention, we investigate and, if warranted,  remind
     the  violator  of  the  terms  of  the  Service  Agreement.    If
     subsequent  violations  are  reported,  access  to the CompuServe
     Information Service  may  be  terminated for the violator and, in
     extreme cases, a  letter  is  sent  from our legal counsel asking
     that he or she cease and desist, or risk further legal action.

             This is done as  a positive step to protect the value and
     use  of  the  material  for    CompuServe    Information  Service
     subscribers,  and  to  discourage unauthorized redistribution  of
     that material.

                        Thank you for using CompuServe!

     [END OF CI$ statement]

     [One  user's  commentary:    From  the  above,  it  appears  that
     CompuServe  is  grappling  with finding some way to  protect  its
     investment    in   establishing  and  maintaining  a  library  of
     user-supported materials.  The recent adoption of a policy of not
     charging for upload time is a two-edged sword:  it is both a boon
     to the subscriber who  goes to the trouble of uploading materials
     to CompuServe and a clear  way for CompuServe to show that it has
     "paid" some consideration for the the material.

     However, nothing CompuServe may do can  allow  it  to  gather  in
     rights which have been scattered to the  public  domain.    As  a
     fundamental  concept of intellectual property law, once something
     is  placed  within  the  public domain, even the original  author
     cannot reclaim it.

     CompuServe  would  appear  to be justified in its stance that  it
     holds  a  compilation  copyright on its contents as a whole.   It
     would  be  difficult  to argue with this position because were it
     not  the  case,  there  would  be  little  or  no  incentive  for
     CompuServe to offer  the  services  which  it does.  Similarly, a
     number of sysops of  hobbyist  bulletin boards (FIDOs, etc.) have
     clearly stated policies saying that  they  do not favor or permit
     massive downloadings of files on their systems.

     CompuServe's concern appear to revolve around  a  need and desire
     to  protect  its contents from being "cloned"  onto  a  competing
     commercial  or  non-commercial  system.   Unfortunately, the line
     between  casual   redistribution  and  "mass  redistribution"  or
     "updating another bulletin  board  regularly" is both ill-defined
     and subjective.

     The CompuServe subscriber agreement is a much stronger protection
     for  CompuServe  than  anything  in  copyright  law.    It  gives
     CompuServe the simple right to suspend the subscription of anyone
     whom it believes is using its services  in an undesirable manner.
     End of story.

     It  is  unlikely  that  CompuServe or any other  service,  be  it
     commercial  or  hobbyist supported, will survive very long unless
     it  adds some perceived value for its users.  CompuServe's  value
     lies in  its  providing  a  national network, extensive libraries
     (both public domain  and  proprietary),  and  a multi-user system
     available at all hours.    While  the  hobbyist  bulletin boards,
     including FIDO and FIDO echomail,  provide similar services, they
     serve different (even if overlapping) user communities.

     Valley Rainbow newsletter, proposes a simple way  in which anyone
     uploading material to CompuServe can protect his or  her interest
     in  the  ownership  and/or  public domain status of the  material
     being uploaded:

          "On the material I have uploaded to CompuServe so far,
          I have chosen one of these options:

          1) Omitting any  copyright,  making  it automatically public
          domain.  As I  understand  it,  CompuServe acknowledges that
          public domain is public domain and that's that.

          2) Attaching a copyright that, in effect, asserts authorship
          but no financial control, i.e.  "Free license is granted for
          non-commercial use." That amounts to saying, "It's mine, but
          I'm giving it away and you can give  it  away  (but not sell
          it), too." The idea is to allow broad distribution  of these
          programs, and I hope that CompuServe accepts this desire and
          does not interfere with it.

          Other  people  may  and  do  upload  software with their own
          license restrictions.    It  seems  to  me that CompuServe's
          policy on allowing  downloading  and  distribution should be
          governed by these licenses  rather  than  the company's best
          guess.

          At the same time, of  course,  authors  are  obliged  to  be
          realistic    and  up  front  about  their    licenses    and
          expectations, which I think they are.   I have seen, "If you
          like this program, send me $10';  I  haven't seen, "You just
          downloaded my program;  send me $200."

     In  conclusion,  it  appears that CompuServe's only intent at the
     moment  is  to restrict the wholesale downloading of materials on
     its service  for  the specific purpose of placing those materials
     in  their  collective  entirety  on  a  competing  commercial  or

     Fido 151/20

                            The Ultimate Utility


     After downloading a number of utilities for use with Fido, I have
     found the best to be one that was created by Marshall Presnell and
     Ben Mann (151/2) called Fido Utility 1.20  It is a collection of
     useful utilities and because they are intergrated into one
     "system" the ease of use is very apparent.  I will try briefly to
     describe the many "wonders" of this program, but it is necessary
     to actually use Fido Utility to appreciate the power of this
     package.

     Fido Utility (FU) is a general purpose Fido utility package which
     replaces or emulates the following packages:

     - Killsrvr - scans the network message area and deletes all
       messages from "Server."

     - Lastuser - finds the last user of the system and prints it out
       to std-out.

     - Twituser - sets the TWIT attribute for the user specified on
       the command line.

     - Bounce - sends a network mail message back to the originator of
       the message.

     - Ricochet - allows you to forward messages to another user on
       another node, similar to forwarding the message.

     - Killto - kills messages in a specified message area TO a
       specified user.

     - Killfrom - kills messages in a specified message area FROM a
       specified user.

     - Waittime - waits until until a certain "real-time" specified on
       the command line and exits.

     - Wait - waits until the minute rolls-over so you will not have
       multiple invokations of a 1-minute external event.

     - Month - sets the errorlevel based on the current month.

     - Userlist - lists all the users in the Fido user.bbs file.  Many
       options are available for listing passwords, access levels, etc.

     - Weekday - returns an errorlevel based on the day of the week.

     - Killrobt - scans the network message and deletes all messages
       from "Robot."

     - Status - displays a status report for your configuration of
     Fidonews                     Page 10                  10 Nov 1986


       Fido.

     - Password - allows for changing a user's password without going
       through the SysOp program.

     - Setpriv - sets a user's privilege level to the one given on the
       command line.

     - Adopt removes the "ORPHAN" mark from one or all mail messages.

     - Twix - scans the network message area and prints the messages
       that have not been read yet.  Options also exist for printing ALL
       messages, also for NOT updating the "number of times read" flag
       in the userlist.

     - Robot - performs automated mailings of files.  This version
       also had an interactive mode for sending files.

     - Sched - allows you to list, set, and query the Fido schedules
       from a command line.

     - Time - simply prints the time to standard output without a
       carraige return.

     - DTR - allows for the control of the DTR signal to you modem
       from DOS.

     - Task - is a "Timed Ask" facility for use in batch files.  It
       will time out unless you answer Y or N within the specified time
       period. Error levels are returned based on the response (or lack
       thereof).

     - Log - allows you to maintain a sysem activity file with little
       difficulty.

     - Space - a utility to determine how much space is left on the
       default disk drive. An option exists to set an error level based
       on whether a certain amount of disk space is free.

     - Datefile - utility to rename files based on the system date.

     - Julian - utility to rename files based on the system date in
       Julian form.

     - Nodedata - prints information about a selected node

     An added extra is that since all utilities print to "standard
     output", they can be redirected anywhere a normal DOS function
     can! This is true for all of the utilities except TASK.

     AND new in Fido Utility version 1.20 is the Fido Utility
     Environment settings which control the banner that FU prints as
     it is started, and the format of the dates used in FU.

     Now for the bad part - This package has been out across the Net
     for months now and to date there are very very few registrations.
     Fidonews                     Page 11                  10 Nov 1986


     Anyone who has seriously tried it I am sure will find it to be
     much more valuable than the $15.00 registration fee.  The public
     distribution archive containing FU.EXE can be obtained from any
     BBS which has it available.  If you find (and I am sure you will)
     FU to be of value to your BBS, Marshall and Ben request that you
     register your copy with them so that they can supply updates and
     enchancements.

     There is also a structure in place for reporting "bugs" in Fido
     Utility, answering questions, and making comments;  If you have a
     problem with FU, send a note with a detailed description of the
     problem to Fido Node 151/3 (The Wizard Line).  If the "To user:"
     line is "FU BUGS", you will receive a reply much faster. Questions
     can be sent to the user "FU QUEST", and comments to "FU CMT". The
     bug reports will be consolidated and forwarded to Marshall. Also,
     requests for a demo version of "Smartman", a 'smart fido message
     manager' that is a commercial product by Marshall Presnell can be
     sent to the user "SM REQ".

     The latest version of Fido Utility is always available on the
     Alert Data Fido (151/2) at (919) 274-5760.  It is also available
     on the Charlotte MetroNet (151/20) at (704) 541-8626.

     The point is - it is an excellent utility program and deserves to
     be seen and used, and the authors deserved to be compensated!

                        Yet Another Nodelist Builder
                        ----------------------------

                                NODEGEN.EXE

          Yes I know what you are saying to yourself, why another
     nodelist builder? Well first there was Listgen which was slow
     and needed a Huge control file. It had updates that changed a
     few things but then version 5.26.86 became obsolete because the
     nodelist excceded it's limits. Second there is XLATLIST which a
     faster than Listgen But It does still require a hefy control
     file but doesn't relly offer anything new. Now there's NODEGEN!
     Nodegen uses a VERY small control file, usually about 1K or
     less, and has some interesting features as well as Being VERY
     FAST. This being the first version of Nodegen and I want to make
     it designed to suite Fido Sysops' needs so there are a few
     things that aren't there that will be in version 1.1. I know you
     are asking why then did you release this as version 1.0. Well
     you see I wanted you to see it and run it and then make some
     constructive critisism. The one feature that is new to the
     nodelist builders is that you can restrict the nodelist.bbs to
     your net only. The reason for that option being there is for the
     Fido Sysops that are running off a IBM PCjr or just want to save
     space and want to restrict the sending of mail. Another feature
     that should probably be called an alteration/enhancement is the
     way the NodeGEN creates the Fidolist.80 & Fidolist.132 files.
     Before It was difficult to extract information from the listings
     or performs types of database functions, but now you can. Also
     Fidolist.80 is now an Indexed file in the respect that all you
     have to do is read the margin to find the node you wanted.
     Hopefully this package will be useful and used, but that again
     is all up to you.
          If you want to get NodeGEN you can:

                  File Request It Through Seadog anytime
                  Send a note & I'll file attach it to you
                  Call 109/640 and just download it.

                           Minutes of the 4th
                       Fido Net 109 Sysops' Meeting
                             October 18, 1986
                         presented once again by
                         Michael Klein (109/610)

        I received so many positive comments about my last compila-
     tion of meeting notes that I decided to come back and do it
     again.  Chalk it up to masochism, if you prefer.

        Anyway, the meeting was held on Saturday, October 18th,
     1986 at Woodlake Towers in Falls Church, Virginia.  In
     attendance were Steven Ranger (621), Alexander Wall (606),
     Robert Rudolph (628), Michael Wyrick and David Ross (both of
     449), Michael Klein and David Schuetz (both of 610), Tom Tugman
     (645), David Page (604), Jack Liebsch (605), Peter Thomas (622),
     Alan Williams (647), Andrew Bilski (611), Sam Hargadine (115),
     and Kurt Reisler, our illustrious coordinator and sysop of
     both 109/74 and 109/483.

        We got underway at about 1300 with introductions and a lot
     of side conversations between individual sysops.  Kurt started
     the official meeting by telling us that we had 44 nodes in the
     net, with 2 awaiting entry.  By the end of the meeting, we had
     45 in the net and 1 waiting, due to the node number assignment
     of 647.

        After the "State of the Network Address" from Kurt, we talked
     about Kurt's trip to San Francisco and his meeting with Tom
     Jennings.  The question that most people had was answered quickly
     when we listened to the tape of the DECUS meeting, at which Tom
     stated that Fido version 12 will continue to be distributed as
     it is currently, with no charge for hobbyists and $100 for
     profit and private organizations.  The documentation, however,
     will cost money, since it is now professionally written, bound,
     typeset, and all that fancy printing stuff.  He could not
     say, however, what was going on with a membership fee in the
     network, since that's the administrator's territory.

        When asked whether Fido versions will become more reliable
     and stable due to this new rewrite, Tom explained in no
     uncertain terms that the versions change like mad, and will
     continue to do so.

        From there, we moved on to local topics, such as certain
     nodes with modem and line problems, and who couldn't connect
     to whom for whatever reasons.  We also discussed the problem
     of DoubleDos crosslinking File Allocation Tables, and the
     only solution offered (and the only one that will work) was
     not to try to write the same file from both partitions at once.
     In other works, renumbering message area 1 while there's someone
     on the board is a definite no-no.  Andrew Bilski (611) once
     again offered his problem that Fido, while it usually catches
     and handles device specifications as filenames (i.e. "T COM1:"),
     does not do so properly under DoubleDos.  No solution to this
     was reached.
     Fidonews                     Page 14                  10 Nov 1986


        The next topic of conversation was SeaDog, which was
     explained and praised by David Page (604), who also explained
     some of the possible future implementations of the program.  He
     talked about the features of SeaDog, and offered to help anyone
     install it once they get it.

        The meeting soon rolled around to the topic of donations and
     the ways in which various sysops regulate the use of their
     systems.  Andrew Bilski (611) asks his users (through the
     Editorial) for donations, also letting them know that their
     access will in no way be hindered by not sending any money.
     He has received many donations, with $100 of it going to Tom
     for Fido.  Alex Wall (606) said that he gives normal access to
     anyone who doesn't send in any donations, with a raise to Privel
     for a $5 donation, and Extra for a $10 donation.  In both cases,
     it seems, people have been more than willing to send in money to
     help cover the cost and expenses of running a Fido system.

        We then discussed the ways in which people back up their hard
     drives.  This is a crucial step in running any kind of changing
     system, since hard disk failures are often sudden and severe.
     The two most popular backup utilities, aside from just straight
     copy-restore techniques, are DataCare and Fastback.  Both are
     nice and fast at backing up, the difference being that DataCare
     backs up without compression, and the DOS RESTORE command must
     be used to recover the data onto the hard disk.  Fastback has
     its own restore function, which allows for compression of data
     (so it takes up about half-3/4 of what it normally would on
     floppies) and quick restoring.  Andrew Bilski and I advocated
     Fastback, while Robert Rudolph said that he'll stand by
     DataCare.

        Now that we'd gotten the old brain cells whirring, we went
     into a biggie: How to switch over to XLATLIST and ROUTEGEN
     without screwing up.  Jack Liebsch (605), our resident Routing
     Doctor, now sends out all routing files in ROUTEGEN format,
     which was found to be more flexible (not to mention the fact
     that LISTGEN has gone to the great House of Obsolescence) in
     the route file structure.  Kurt put up a sample XLATLIST
     control file (his own) on his system for people to download
     and modify, and I haven't heard any reports of trouble over
     the conversion.

        Someone then came up with a question about 9600 baud modems.
     Kurt says that he has two of them, but never even bothered to
     unpackage them.  They cannot communicate at anything other
     than 9600 baud, making them well nigh impractical. It was
     decided that they might be quite useful on inbound and outbound
     hosts, but for the most part, due to the fact that they're not
     in wide use as of yet, they're not much good to us right now.

        Echomail was the next topic of discussion.  Kurt, as the
     SYSOP and IFNA hub, took down the node numbers of those who
     wanted to be added to those two areas.  We also discussed
     the latest version (1.36) of Echomail and the general opinion
     seemed to be that it's more trouble to implement that it's
     Fidonews                     Page 15                  10 Nov 1986


     worth in added features.  Michael Wyrick (449), Michael Klein
     (guess who), and David Schuetz (co-sysop of 610) presented
     their plan for a new program called DirectMail, which works
     differently from the Echomail concept, and allows netwide
     messages between individual users.  (Editor's note: The
     program, at this stage, is approximately 3/4 of the way
     finished.  Look for it at a theater near you in about three
     weeks).

        We then talked about in-net routing, and the use of our
     NCR (No-Cost Routing) system.  Jack Liebsch (605) will continue
     to serve as our Routing Guru.  Net 109, being in a rather odd
     local/long distance area code breakdown (which I won't go into
     here for fear of a migraine), has a very odd routing scheme,
     but Jack seems to have kept it straight so far.  An idea was
     suggested (and has been thought about for a long time) to
     have the numerous Baltimore nodes split off and form their
     own net, which would ease routing and take a few nodes off
     Kurt's back.  That one's still up in the air.

        By now, it was about 1530, and the question was posed as
     to whether anyone had anything else to say.  Surprisingly
     enough, nobody did, so we scheduled the next meeting for
     sometime in the middle of November and called it a day.

        Meeting adjourned.

     Doug Mohney
     Fido 109/74 "The Bear's Den"

                         Doug's Column

         IF THEY CAN DO IT, SO CAN I: Look at Dvorak, Webster,
     and Pournelle. All of them write about computers, but let's
     face facts: Everyone and their grandmother cuddles up to
     them to get Good Press, sending them free computers and
     software to review, going out on magazine-funded junkets to
     strip bars in Atlanta (Dvorak), and not knowing anything
     about computers.

         Think I'm kidding? Ok: How many common users do you
     know who use S-100 buses and have the fantasy of seeing
     Concurrent CP/M becoming the operating system of the 80s'
     in 1986. That's ok; Mr. Pournelle writes Science FICTION.

         I have this urge to write. So I'm writing
     a column; if I'm lucky, lots of software companies will
     send me free software to review and the FidoNews will fund
     my junket to Comdex/Atlanta. If not, I'll keep on writing
     just to make people think.

         WHO AM I?:  I'm a college student at the U. of Maryland
     (the place where the basketball player died), don't use
     drugs, and am the president of the Personal Computing
     Association. PCA is an undergraduate user group. I keep
     on getting elected Pres because I do all the paperwork.

         I also use/apply/poke around with IBM-PCs, Macs, Apple
     //es, Atari STs, VAXen, HP3000s, and IBM 4341s. Most of my
     useful work is done on micros, and I don't claim to be
     a hacker or an expert on anything. I am a USER, and proud
     of it. I've written some docs, put on two computer shows,
     and got DEC to donate a MicroVAX I to PCA. And I don't
     use drugs.

         GOSSIP TIME:  All good columnists either A) Give good
     gossip, B) Review products or C) Talk about products and
     then speculate about the latest products (Gossip). I'll
     pass on my tidbits, then rip on companies.

         Green Berets Use Macs: I went to a dPub
     "seminar" at a local Apple dealer. A whole 4 people showed
     up, including an enlisted man from Special Forces. After
     the Apple rep had finished his sermon on dPub, the Beanie
     and I played with the Abatron 300 dpi scanner, and talked
     for a little.
         The Beanies, due to their unique "mission" in the Army,
     write their own manuals, using Tempest Macs
     and PageMaker. The grunt was running around trying to find
     Fidonews                     Page 17                  10 Nov 1986


     a high-quality scanner to feed lots of pictures through and
     asking hard questions on delivery (ASAP) and price.

         OTHER GOODIE: My friends, 2nd generation hackers who
     are Indian/Chinese and eat pizza, keep on muttering
     about building a lap-top UNIX machine with 68020, SCSI, 40
     Meg hard-drive and Ethernet. Wish they'd hire me to market
     it, but I have no idea who'd need one: NASA or NSA? Hope
     they're nice and let me beta-test or review it. Naw.

         RUDE COMMENTS HERE: AT&T has stated it is getting out
     of general micro sales. Hahahahahaha. They never started.
     Example: PCA tried to get an AT&T
     rep to talk about machines. No call back. No mail.
     We sent in an application for an equipment grant via
     registered mail. No phone call. No mail. This from a
     company who helped develop the nation's phone system. Uh
     huh.

         AT&T sells (sold?) 6300s through the computer store
     at Maryland. Amount of advertising in school newspaper
     for AT&T long-distance:
     Massive. Amout of advertising for 6300: Nada. This on a
     campus where Apple is spending lots of money on gimmicky
     promos and IBM doesn't have to advertise 'cuz they
     donated 600+ machines.

         DEEP STATEMENT: The 8-bit world is dead. At
     Computerfest '86, there were plenty of Amigas, some
     Atari ST's. Half the room was PC-DOS/MS-DOS. Some Mac.
     No Apple //. No Atari 8-bit. Few C-64 groups.

         I think Atari will own the $1,000 (full system
     price) market by Summer '87. Current price for an
     Apple //e box, with 128K card, no drives, no monitor
     is $599. A 520ST with 1 drive, mono monitor, and
     built-in serial, parallel, DMA, and MIDI is $495.
     Which would you buy, ignoring the technical superiority
     of 6502 vs 68000, 128K vs 512K RAM, and 360K 3 1/2"
     vs 128K 5 1/4"? Trying to compare the C-64 to the ST
     isn't even funny. Oops. Forgot the ST has a mouse.

         MOST STUPID COMMERCIAL DEPARTMENT: HP's showing
     various Yuppies stepping out of the shower,

          Well, since I wrote the article explaining exactly what I was
     trying to do in setting up a software distribution node, I have heard
     from and been called by a LOT of you out there. I have received calls
     from Australia, the UK, Sweden, Canada, and from all over the US.

          As I explained in that article, I am attempting to set up a
     distribution node for the LATEST in Fido software and related support
     programs and utilities. To date I have been sent over 30 files for
     this area alone and have been sent messages requesting I pick up
     certain files from either this node or that node. I attempt to do so
     in as many cases as possible, but I simply cannot stand the LONG
     DISTANCE for too much longer. I will eventually get to you if you
     asked me to get your program and please be patient, I am working as
     fast as I can.

          Now on to other things.....namely, the programs in the
     distribution area. I have over 130 files now ranging from utilities
     that will let you customize your menus to EchoMail version to
     Mailcost version 1.4 to the latest in a variety of other system
     utilities and support programs. I am overwhelmed by the response you
     have shown by this and I guess it could be deemed a huge success by
     these standards alone, however, now I face another problem. I am
     being barraged by requests for me to send the files out on disk to
     this net or that one to save them on the LONG DISTANCE charges. I
     will ATTEMPT to do so ONLY in the case of INTERNATIONAL callers and
     then only if they will agree to send me a box of disks to copy the
     files onto and a mailer (stamped and addressed to themselves) to mail
     them back in. Again I can't afford all the disks this could possibly
     cost me even though I pay only $29 per hundred in bulk less sleeves.
     I mean the postage alone on a box of ten disks suitably packaged for
     mailing would run about $2 or $3. I will either format them here in
     IBM 360k format, or you can format them and tell me what format they
     are in so I can copy the files over to them. Right now the entire
     distribution area is almost 3 MEG and growing. I can also FASTBACK
     (tm) the files to disks for you if you want to and can restore them
     to a hard drive. I do not however trust the DOS back-up command too
     much so I will have to shy away from that format.

          In Fastback (tm) format it takes about 7 disks to do
          In copy format it takes about 10 disks to do

          ALL files are ARCED (tm) and will un-arc using arc512 (which I
     can also provide as a regular file)

          If you wish me to send you these files on disk then here is what
     you do:

          Send me a box of disks (you will receive them ALL back) and a
     self-addressed STAMPED mailer big enough to hold them all to:

                  Memphis, TN 38186-0223
                  U.S.A.

          I will copy over the files and send them back free of any other
     charges. If you do send a donation though, I will forward it on to
     IFNA. I do ask that you send me a few files (I will keep those that I
     need for the distribution area) on the disks when you send them to
     me. This way the distribution area will constantly grow so that Fido
     and FidoNet can continue to grow with it. One last point. I cannot be
     selective in what files I send out, I simply copy the file area over
     to disk and mail them out. That way you get EVERYTHING I have here on
     the day I get the disks ! But remember it is always growing so.....

          I also have EVERY ISSUE of FidoNews here too ! I have them in
     two formats, the second of which will interest those with a LARGE
     Commodore userbase. The first format is ARC, issue by issue. The
     second is also ARC, BUT it is a NEW ARC program for the Commodore 64
     that is Public Domain. These files are almost as small as the IBM arc
     versions of the same files and I will provide them along with the
     program for the Commodore to un-arc them with ! The NEWS files I can
     provide in either IBM disk format OR Commodore 1541 disk format (if
     you have one of those). The IBM format is ready to place ON-LINE for
     users to d/l to their Commodores since all are converted to Commodore
     ASCII format and then ARCED with the Commodore ARC program. I cannot
     IBM arc these since the two programs (IBM version and Commodore
     version) are SO CLOSE in operation that the only difference I find is
     in the ARC file header. If I IBM ARC these files then they will be
     corrupted, thus I sent them as standard IBM files. All FidoNews
     issues in Commodore format are compliments of Mr. Mike Gordon (one of
     my hard core supporters) and I wish to thank him for making the
     conversions in the text and ARC services on his Commodore.

          If you have any questions about the Commodore ARC program or its
     operation you can netmail Mike Gordon or myself at 123/6.

          Again......Thank you for the tremendous response you have shown
     in having a distribution node. I have not heard from IFNA or anyone
     associated with it in regards to it impact or even it's usefulness as
     a system, but I think they would not mind. If they are reading this I
     would like to APPLY for listing under the International FidoNet
     Association as the "official" support distribution node, in the
     nodelist. I think this way the net will know that I carry as much
     Fido stuff as I can lay my hands on and they can be 80% certain to be
     able to get it here when they call.

          Authors postscript.....If I do receive any funds from this for
     copy services I will forward them on to IFNA for their use.

                            +=================+
                            !The Nautical View!

                           Part 3: The "Open BBS"


        I realize that this column is normally Commodore  oriented.  I
     am a Commodore owner,  but I am also a sysop of a local BBS ("The
     Flight Deck", 403-235-1659).  There is a phenomenon occuring that
     deserves comment: the concept of the "open BBS".

        I've heard about this spreading throughout the  U.S.,  and  in
     fact  some  areas have nothing but "open boards".  What I mean by
     this is a board in which all you must do to gain full  access  is
     type your name.  No security checks,  no nothin'.  Generally, the
     boards here in Calgary are NOT  open  boards  (the  Calgary  Fido
     being  one of the few exceptions).  This,  in my opinion,  is the
     way it SHOULD be!  What sysop in his  or  her  right  mind  would
     allow any person to logon and have full access?  I just can't see
     it.  To  illustrate  my  point,  I'll relate the story of a board
     here in town called "The Means  of  Escape".  This  was  an  open
     board,  whereby  all  you  had to do was call.  If you weren't an
     established user,  it gave you an ID# and  a  password,  so  that
     nobody else could logon as you.  It did not work.  Soon there was
     chaos.  Twits  logging  on  and bad-mouthing the board and/or the
     sysop and/or one or more of the users.  Pirates advertising their
     "warez".  Users  impersonating  other  users  and  saying  things
     uncomplimentary.  Etc.  Etc.  All  the  while I was maintaining a
     public debate with the sysop.  He argued that  a  BBS  should  be
     "open",  and  that  intelligent  conversations  could occur.  His
     opinion only,  since all I ever saw  was  name-calling  and  mud-
     slinging.  Worst of all, there were practically NO users who used
     their real names: all handles, so you could never go on to one of
     the more intelligent boards and say "So and so did this", because
     you  never know who so and so is!  Anyway,  "The Means of Escape"
     is BBS history now.  The world is a better place without it.

        This is the policy on my BBS.  You, the new user, call up.  On
     the opening prompt,  you are asked to enter your name.  The board
     then  checks  to  see  if  you  exist,  and if not,  displays the
     application information.  When applying,  you MUST  provide  your
     real  name,  real  phone  number,  what  city you live in,  and a
     password for  future  use.  After  24  to  48  hours,  you'll  be
     validated.  I  look over the names of prospective new users,  and
     any that I'm suspicious of get a  phone  call.  I've  managed  to
     "intercept" dozens of hoax names,  and I'm damn glad of it.  As a
     result,  the conversations on my board  tend  to  be  of  a  more
     sophisticated  level.  None  of  this "My computer rules!  Your's
     sucks!" crap.  We talk about a LOT of things,  and mild profanity
     IS  allowed.  Wanna  know something?  People rarely use it.  They
     KNOW that their real names are attached to anything  they  write,
     Fidonews                     Page 22                  10 Nov 1986


     and  if  the  profanity  is  abusive,  they  are  warned (further
     infractions result in  their  accounts  being  turfed).  Although
     some  of  the  humour  encountered  is rather "bent" (we've got a
     troupe of older gentlemen  who  are  a  tad  bizarre),  it  isn't
     anything to be ashamed of.

        There  are numerous other boards in town who operate this way.
     Long before I began running my own  BBS,  when  I  first  got  my
     modem,  I  tried  calling  every  board  in town every day.  This
     became cumbersome  after  awhile,  so  I  started  dropping  some
     boards.  Most  of  the  ones  I  dropped  were  of  the "open" or
     "handles only" variety.  Don't  get  me  wrong:  there  ARE  some
     boards  where  handles  are allowed and intelligent conversations
     happen:  boards like Fly By Wire,  Calgary Fido,  Flight  Service
     Station,  and a few others.  These are the exception to the rule,
     however.  My opinion boils down  to  this:  as  a  general  rule,
     boards  that  allow  handles  or are of the "open" variety aren't
     worth  bothering  with.  They  generally  attract  users  of  the
     "immature"  level,  and  that  just  isn't  for  me.  I  fail  to
     comprehend the reasoning behind  the  "open"  or  "handles  only"
     boards.  Is  there anyone out there who can explain it to me?  If
     so,  please submit  a  reply  to  the  FidoNews,  as  I  am  MOST
     interested in hearing it.  For now,  I will cut this short.  Till
     we meet again:  ciao fer niao,  and let's do the lunch thing REAL
     soon!


        I'm interested in answering any of your questions about either
     the 64 or 128.  If you are having a problem,  please address your
     mail to Joe Lindstrom via Calgary Fido (Net 134 Node 1), and I'll
     address it in an upcoming article.  If you would like to  contact
     me  in  person,  I  run  a  300  baud  BBS ("The Flight Deck") at
     403-235-1659.
