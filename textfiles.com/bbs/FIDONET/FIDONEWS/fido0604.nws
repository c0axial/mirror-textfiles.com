                            Would Like to
                               ANNOUNCE

                               FIDOCON '89


     The 1989 FidoCon will be held in San Jose, CA., Thursday
     Aug. 24th through Sunday August 27th. We would like to take
     this opportunity to notify all interested parties of the
     event, and invite one and all to the FidoCon, regardless of
     Net Affiliation.

     The San Jose Holiday Inn will be the Headquarters of the
     Event. We are anticipating this as being one of the most
     successful FidoCons ever held. We have special room rates
     for FidoCon 89. The rates are:

              Single/Double......$60.00
              Triple............. 70.00
              Each Add'l Rollaway.10.00

     We are in negotiations  for Airline and Car Rental rates.
     We have talked to AMTRAK, and found that their Discover
     America Ticket, is the cheapest they will go. However, if
     a group of at least 15 people go, the 16th person is free.

     1:1/89 is in place to handle distribution of information
     regarding FidoCon 89. Carl Linden of 1:143/1 is the Chairman
     of the Planning Committee. Jim Cannell of 1:143/21 is
     handling IFNA interface. Todd Looney of 1:143/27 is working
     on the Trade Show. I am working on Speakers and Meetings.

     The fees for FidoCon are:

           Pre-Registration: $60.00 (includes Trade Show)
           After July 1st:    75.00 (includes Trade Show)
           Trade Show:         5.00/day

     Registrations will begin on Feb. 15th. All Mail in regi-
     strations must be received by Aug. 15th. Souvenirs will
     be available, as well as tourist information for the San
     Francisco Bay/San Jose area.

     Currently we are planning for workshops/meetings on the
     following:

         UseNet -- Tim Pozer (confirmed)
         Batch File Writing for BBS'
     FidoNews 6-04                Page 2                   23 Jan 1989


         Network Awareness (for new or prospective Sysops)
         Binkley, TBBS, OPUS, Fido, SeaDog, (etc.) set-up & tips
         Sysops (BBS) and the Law
         Handicapped & Special Interests
         New Program Releases & Tips/Set-up
         Other??

     The FidoCon Schedule (tentative) is as Follows:

     Thursday Evening:  Reception & Cash Bar
     Friday Day:        Meetings, Workshops & Trade Show
     Friday Evening:    Banquet (Not included in Registration)
     Saturday Day:      Meetings, Workshops & Trade Show
     Saturday Evening:  OPEN -- For Special Net Dinners, etc.
     Sunday Day:        Meetings, Trade Show

     I need to hear from anyone needing meetings to be scheduled,
     or working on any of the workshops (as well as ideas for
     additional workshops). Also, if anyone is planning on
     releasing new or updated software at the FidoCon, we would
     appreciate your letting us know, so we can schedule it. (We
     won't steal your thunder! Honest...Truust meee!)

     Since I have not previously been to a FidoCon I don't know
     how they are handled. However, we are planning on a Trade
     Show/Flea Market type Computer Show to coincide with
     FidoCon. We are in the process of figuring Booth rates at
     this point. Anyone interested in sponsoring a booth should
     also let us know. The Trade Show will run from Noon Friday
     the 25th through 4 P.M. Sunday the 27th.

     1:1/89 will be handling information requests, registration,
     and moderating the FCON_89 Echo Conference. Requests for
     links to the Echo, and other information should be routed
     through 1:1/89.

     For those releasing new or updated software, we are planning
     on having systems available that will be able to copy the
     files onto 360k, 1.2m and 1.4m diskettes.

     Virginia Harlow, 109/687 AKA 109/303
     Fidonet 109 Presents Mama Awards

     Virginia Harlow made her debut appearance at our meetings
     with a splash. She has inaugurated something she calls the
     "Mama" awards, and (together with a secret underground
     conspiracy of Net-109ers) she purchased and presented a number
     of awards to those who had made a significant contribution
     to Net 109 in 1988.  The recipients were chosen based on a
     poll of various Net-109ers and then narrowed down to those
     who had specifically made a big contribution in 1988 and
     specifically to Net 109.

     Many of the recipients were absent, and perhaps they will
     first hear about their awards in this newsletter.  Bill Andrus,
     Net 109 Coordinator, was given custody of their awards, on
     the assumption that he will be present at every meeting and
     thus eventually have an opportunity to pass them on to their
     rightful owners.

     The awards consisted of trophies of varying sizes.  On each was
     a medallion with a picture of the earth with a cable going
     around it, and a PC, printer, and some other hardware. At the
     base of each award was the recipient's name, and the words:

     "Fidonet 109" and "We Appreciate".

     Recapping  the list of recipients:

     Mike Mahoney was given an award for maintaining the Net 109
     library for us all.

     Joe Keenan was given an award for being one of the three
     original echo hubs and for being so helpful to so many.

     Bill Andrus was given an award for his work on the echo hub
     systems, and for giving technical help to (probably) everyone
     in the net.

     David Page was given an award for being our echo coordinator,
     for his work on the hub system, and also for being of help to
     one and all.

     Sam Hargadine's award was for his reliable service in supplying
     us all with Fidonews.

     Ray Gwinn was awarded a plaque with the words "With Sincere
     Appreciation" for providing us with local access to the
     Eastern Star, thus making all our echos
     available to us for free.

     And last but not least, Kurt Reisler was given an award for all
     that he's done for the net, which really would take a very long
     time to list, and for being our "Bear Emeritus."

     Honorable mention was also given to Chard Nelson, Mark
     FidoNews 6-04                Page 4                   23 Jan 1989


     Oberg, Jeff Balderson and Pat McDonald for their general
     helpfulness to everyone, and to Dot Hage for writing NERFFREE.
     Dot said, "It was a privilege being able to help out in the
     presentation of these awards".

     As Virginia said in her remarks, in the past whenever
     anyone has done a good job in the net, they've been rewarded
     with more work and more responsibility.  Now a few of them have
     been rewarded in a more touching and concrete way.  There was a
     round of applause for each recipient.

     Kevin Murie
     Fidonet 1:385/3

                   A few thoughts on PC-Pursuit

          When I first heard of PC-Pursuit, my first reaction was
     disbelief.  "What?", I said.  "I can get UNLIMITED CONNECT
     TIME for my modem?"  I have been a user of PCP for just over
     two years now.  It has been a very good deal for computer
     users and the Fidonet in particular.  I'm not going to get
     into the discussion of 9600 vs. PCP, as that is not the goal
     of this article.

     Many people have subscribed to PC-Pursuit to take advantage
     of the excellent deal offered by Telenet Communications Corp.
     They allow anyone with a modem to access 34 major cities in
     the U.S. from 6:00 PM to 7:00 AM CST weekdays and 24 hours
     on weekends, as well as allowing use on several holidays during
     the year.  This service was $25 to sign up, and $25 a month for
     UNLIMITED usage during the hours mentioned above.

     On January 4, 1989, users of Telenet's PC-Pursuit service
     received a new contract notifying them that there would be
     increases in the monthly rate.  There would also be a CAP
     set...that is, a limit on the amount of connect time one
     account may use.  After that amount is reached, they will
     bill the customer at $4.50 per hour for the next 30 hours.
     I will not go into the next 30 hours, other schedules or any
     of the other quirks that I personally find in their proposed
     billing plan.  I will explain how to get more info at the
     end of this article.

     Approx. 3 days and 700 messages later, Telenet posted an
     amended announcement changing several of their terms.
     The main thing this amended notice did was to extend to
     May 1, 1989, the date to implement the CAP system.  The
     flat rate of $30 a month WILL go into effect Feb. 1, 1989.

     What PC-Pursuit did for echomail in the Fidonet is nothing
     short of miraculous.  It allowed us, as sysops, to offer
     FREE echomail to our users.  This increased the information
     pool to a point no one had forseen.  It allowed ANYONE with
     a computer to get answers to their questions, or provide
     answers, on a wide variety of topics.  All this cost the
     PCP sysop the same each month.

     There have always been problems with PC-Pursuit.  Everyone used
     to yell and scream at Telenet to 'fix this' and 'fix that.'
     Most just accepted the fact that for $25 a month, there
     would be a certain degree of difficulty with the service.

     All in all, PC-Pursuit is (was) a great bargain, especially for
     a Fidonet node wishing to provide his/her users (and him/her-
     self) with cost-efficient echomail.  Now that new rates have
     been proposed, it makes it very difficult to get a good deal
     out of PC-Pursuit.  With the CAP imposed, it is very
     FidoNews 6-04                Page 6                   23 Jan 1989


     difficult to expand with user demand.

     As of this date, 01-11-89, Telenet DOES NOT provide a means
     for users to check their time used.  Basically, you accept
     your bill when it comes, with no means to verify readings.
     By using the service you agree to the above as stated in
     their Terms and Conditions.

     Here are a few log entries from Binkleyterm that cause me to
     question the billing methods planned by Telenet.  These dis-
     crepancies are NOT new, I have just 'overlooked' them in the
     past based on the unlimited usage policy.  In light of the pro-
     posal that we are to be charged by the hour, I do not define
     these types of log entries as acceptable service that I wish to
     pay for by the hour...

     Note to BinkleyTerm sysops: I have altered the following
     log entries for 2 reasons.  So they would meet the Fidonews
     submission guidelines and to delete some of the irrelevant
     verbosity generated in the BinkleyTerm Log when using level 5.

     NONE OF THE TIMES IN THE FOLLOWING LOG EXCERPTS HAVE BEEN
     ALTERED BY ME OR ANYONE IN ANY WAY, SHAPE OR FORM.

     According to the log, I was connected from 19:12:16 to 20:32:48.
     For this connect time, I receive nothing.  That's not true.  I
     do get a bill from Telenet charging me for connect time.  Do not
     attempt to blame BinkleyTerm. I called direct, and everything
     worked just fine, AND at 2400 baud.  I am unable to use PCP at
     2400 as I do not have a local 2400 baud port.  Oddly enough, I
     am still billed based on the 30 hour monthly CAP.

     20:36:33 I start receiving. At 20:44:42, the transfer aborts.

     Again, another poll...

     How about that? Went a whole 11 minutes this time. Still, I have
     nothing for my trouble or connect time.  But that's not totally
     true.  You see, when Binkleyterm aborts, it saves what it has.
     If nothing has been appended to the packet (ie. if no mail has
     been added), the packet will resume where it left off.  What
     follows is the relevant log data for 1/4/89.

     I've received the 225K packet.  My system has been trying since
     20:36.  It's now 23:30 and I've picked up a 225K packet of mail.
     Looking at my log, I was online for 1 hour, 59 minutes, 16
     seconds.  Keep in mind this is the time I spent actually con-
     nected to the BBS.  This time does not include script proces-
     sing time, time to connect to my local indial, time getting
     past the BUSY outdial, and if the BBS was BUSY.  Nor does it

     include the NO DIAL TONE messages, or account for a 'bad port'
     as they call it.  When you connect to one of these 'bad ports',
     Telenet wants you to call them (while still connected to the
     'bad port') and tell them. Due to the script, it's really quite
     impossible to do this.  What of those who have only one line?

     So I've processed the mail, and it is packed up and ready to be
     shipped on down the line...

     ALRIGHT!  The mail finally made it.  And it only took from
     01:04:12 to 03:47:15 to send 571K.  49 WHOPPING percent eff.

     At a flat rate, even a little more than $25 a month, I can live
     with these difficulties.  The mail is extremely delayed and my
     system is busy trying to pick up this stuff about 50% more of
     FidoNews 6-04                Page 9                   23 Jan 1989


     the time than it should with the retries and all.

     I will stick with the service until May 1.  If either:

     A) Telenet doesn't change their position on their CAP toward
        the TOTAL elimination of said cap, or at a DRASTIC increase
        in said cap, the service will no longer be of use to me and
        will cause me to cancel my subscription, unfortunate as it
        would be.

     B) The service is not improved.  I have no problem with the fact
        that PC-Pursuit wishes to be a profit-producing body. I also
        have no problem with paying the higher rates, not the ones
        which are currently being proposed, but somewhat higher than
        $25 a month for flat rate usage.  What I can not stand for is
        being charged PROFESSIONAL rates on a system which barely
        meets the needs of the hobbiest.

     C) If ANY CAP goes into effect, I will demand a 2400 indial port
        to make use of their newly expanded 2400 baud outdial sites.
        If they can not meet this requirement, I will have to cancel.

     This article was inspired by the latest developments regarding
     the rate increases imposed by Telenet Communications Corp., and
     by the realization that if these new rates do go into effect,
     my BBS will be hit very hard and the users will lose a valuable
     feature, that being netmail and echomail.  Not to mention the
     files I collect from distant places to provide the users.

     I have made available a text file called PCP-RATE.ARC.  It
     contains information related to the PCP rate increases,
     specific schedules, and rates as posted by Telenet management.
     It is suitable as a bulletin or as a file to be downloaded
     by your users.  It may be FREQ'd from 385/3  24 hours a day.

     The PC-Pursuit BBS may be reached by connecting to your local
     Telenet dial-up and entering C PURSUIT <CR>.  Just follow the
     instructions on the logon screen to obtain access.

     I feel that I am not alone.  If you sit back and let it happen,
     be assured it will.  All voices in unison make quite a racket.
     Tymnet is currently conducting a feasability survey to deter-
     mine whether or not a service similiar to PC-Pursuit would be
     worth their while.  You can call 1-800-872-7654 and ask to take
     the SURVEY.

     If you have any comments regarding this article or any points

             FidoNews Policy Changes by Rick Siegel 1:107/27

             As chairman of the publications committee of IFNA, I have
     been requested, by the president, to solicit opinion on changes
     to FidoNews policy and to compile a consensus and advisory to him
     by Jan 17, 1988.

             I ask anyone interested in expressing himself on this
     matter send netmail to Rick Siegel at 1:107/27 prior to that, and
     preferably a few days prior so that your opinion may be included
     in the consensus.

             I have never written anything for FidoNews, and this is
     my first shot at this. I am not a writer, please forgive my
     corruption of the English language.

             I would, however, like to let you all know my opinion of
     this affair.

             It seems that the crux of the complaints about FidoNews
     revolve around an article by Tom Jennings. I have read the
     article. I have not seen any complaints. Then again, I do not
     subscribe to SysOp or IFNA echoes.

             I find it quite incredulous that anyone did not
     understand the content and intent of the Jennings article.
     Certainly it was not computer oriented in it's content. However,
     it was a "piece of life" for Tom Jennings, and he shared it with
     us, the SysOps in a network he envisioned and created. Yet this
     network is full of the diversity from which Tom had spoken, so it
     does stand to reason some will be offended in many ways.

             For those that were offended, may we look deeper. Tom
     Jennings is the founding visionary of the network we call
     FidoNet. We don't owe him a penny for this. But perhaps what we
     owe him is to keep the ideals he envisioned within his creation of
     FidoNet. Perhaps we can offer him a little something in return,
     like a platform like FidoNews to allow him to communicate the
     frustrations he faces in his daily life. It is my opinion that if
     Tom writes it, there is something of interest, if only to note
     what is going on with the granddad of FidoNet.

             Additionally, using this article as a ram rod to put
     shackles on the editor of FidoNews and make moves to allow the
     IFNA board to control editorial substance will take the years of
     freedom to express and reverse it to one of constant bickering
     among the wolves of the echoes.

             I would be remiss to allow a few individuals who enter a
     majority of negative comment sway the flow of information to the
     majority. I find the policy for FidoNews fine for the purpose,
     and time proven.

             Since there is a limited time for any of you to respond
     to this, I have taken the liberty of contacting some SysOps
     direct. I would however like to hear from anyone, and as soon as
     FidoNews 6-04                Page 11                  23 Jan 1989


     possible. Please let me know what you feel by contacting Rick
     Siegel at 1:107/27, which is #CM at 1200/2400 baud.

             I appreciate your time and efforts to making this
     research work.

                           Orphaned Utilities
                            January 4, 1989

     In  late 1987 I wrote 11 utilities I called the STEWTILS that
     were  specific  for  Fido  version  12.  These utilities were
     distributed  on  the backbone worldwide and documentation was
     also   distributed   in  FidoNews.   I  have  received  notes
     including  a  recent  Canadian `MailGram' about them from all
     over,  most  asking  for additions, one suggesting a possible
     bug, and so forth.

     Although  every  note  I've received indicates an "intention"
     to  register  their copies, not one has included so much as a
     dime.  Not one cent has ever been received for ANY work I've
     done for ANY of the PD software I've written!

     I  have  therefore  decided  to  orphan  those utilities.  No
     support,  bug  fixes,  or  updates  will  be released, and no
     further    utilities    will   be   developed   for   general
     distribution.  No inquiries will be acknowleged.
