                        Towards Better Communications

        There's a problem common to this sort of communication.  All 
        you ever see is my words.  You don't see any facial 
        expressions or body gestures, or even hear a tone of voice.  
        The result is that it can often sound very cold and distant, 
        even if the author meant to be warm and friendly.  Jokes 
        tend to sound like hostile insults, and wistful comments 
        come across as griping complaints.

        The problem is one of communication.  Too much of our daily 
        banter is nonvocal or subvocal, and gets squeezed out when 
        the words are reduced to the printed page (or the painted 
        screen).

        So I propose a solution.  I suggest that we extend the 
        language, at least when used on bulletin boards, to include 
        clues to all the nonverbal signals normally taken for 
        granted.  My idea works like this:

        When you want to express a subvocal noise or utterance, 
        enclose it within a "(*" and a "*)".  For example, to 
        express a sigh at the end of a wistful comment, type it as 







FIDONEWS     --           01 Jul 85  00:00:21           Page 2

        "(*SIGH*)".

        When you want to express a nonvocal gesture, enclose it 
        within a "[*" and a "*]".  For example, to indicate a non-
        committal shrug of the shoulders, type it as "[*SHRUG*]".

        If multiple gestures or utterances are to be indicated, they 
        can be enclosed in the same "gesture brackets", but should 
        be separated by a semicolon.

        Will this system work?  [*NOD*] Yes, it should, (*SIGH*) if 
        used properly.  Will anyone use it?  [*SHRUG;FROWN*] Beats 
        me.

                Computer Hacker Convicted of Tapping ARPANET
                            By MICHAEL D. HARRIS

           LOS ANGELES (UPI) _ A young home computer whiz was 
        convicted of illegally tapping into an international network 
        linking research agencies doing work for the Department of 
        Defense.  

           Ronald M. Austin, 20, a UCLA physics major from Santa 
        Monica, was found guilty Tuesday of breaking into 200 
        computer files at 14 military, university and private 
        research organizations from San Diego to Norway.  

           Among the organizations whose computer systems Austin 
        penetrated from July to November 1983 were the Rand Corp. a 
        Santa Monica think tank; the Naval Research Laboratory in 
        Washington; the Norwegian Telecommunication Agency; the UCLA 
        Department of Computer Science and the Naval Oceans Systems 
        Center in San Diego, prosecutors said.  

           Superior Court Judge Gordon Ringer found Austin guilty of 
        12 felony counts of malicious access to a computer system at 
        the conclusion of a two-day non-jury trial, but acquitted 
        him of one count of receiving stolen airline tickets that 
        investigators seized from his residence.  

           Ringer scheduled sentencing Aug. 23, when he could send 
        Austin to prison or place him on probation. Austin's 
        attorney said he would appeal the conviction.  

           Austin was arrested in November 1983 after he allegedly 
        used his Commodore 64 home computer to gain access to the 
        Advanced Research Projects Agency Network, or ARPANET, that 
        links research organizations under contract to the Defense 
        Department.  

           When charges were filed, prosecutors said Austin not only 
        had access to "very sensitive" data, but also deleted files 
        and caused "hundreds of thousands of dollars damage" to the 
        computer systems.  

           But a Defense Department spokeswoman, Sherry Stetson-
        Mannix, said Austin could not have obtained any classified 
        information from any members of the network.  

           Prosecutors said Austin broke into the system at UCLA, 
        one of several universities in the network, through four 
        separate telephone numbers in a scenario similar to that 
        depicted in the hit movie "War Games." 

           In the film, a teenage hacker enters defense computers on 
        a lark and nearly sets off a nuclear war.  

           The ARPANET system has since been divided into two

        networks making it more difficult for college researchers to 
        exchange information with military users.  

           In news interviews following his arrest, Austin admitted 
        that he penetrated the system with his home computer, but 
        denied any damage was done.  

           Other members of the network whose computer systems were 
        cracked by Austin included Purdue University; University of 
        Wisconsin; Cornell University and UC Berkeley.  

           Austin remains free on bail pending sentencing.

             A few FIDONEWS issues back, someone mentioned the idea
        of hooking the Fido network into the USENET network.  The
        author correctly stated that the only problem with that
        was getting a USENET host to cooperate.  Well, I have been
        able to take care of that problem by getting my company
        (Automatix, Inc. in Billerica, MA) to agree to letting us
        access the USENET articles of interest.  Actually, since I
        am the UUCP/USENET/remote mail/telecommunications guru at
        Automatix, I gave myself this permission.  It took me
        about 4 hours, and a lot of testing, but I currently have
        our VAX 11/780 running 4.2BSD UNIX sending selected USENET
        newsgroups to my IBM PC running Fido.  I use KERMIT to do
        the actual file transferring.  Currently, it just sends one
        very large file with the newest news from all of the groups
        batched into it.  I am still working on a program to
        unbatch them at the PC end, and place them in separate news
        directories (as is done on the VAX).  When that is complete
        I will have to add support for replying to the news
        articles (this will undoubtedly be the hardest part).

             Anyone interested in receiving any of the USENET news
        via FidoNet mail, please let me know what newsgroups you
        are interested in.  Currently I only send net.micro.pc and
        net.lang.c, but that can be expanded.  If you are not sure
        of what USENET is, but you might be interested in finding
        out, send me a FidoNet message, and I can send you a list
        of all of the available newsgroups, and a short description
        of what USENET is.
