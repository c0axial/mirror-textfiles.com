     =================================================================


     With this issue, I am resigning as Editor of the FidoNews.

     In the established practice of all FidoNews Editors in Fido history,
     I am urging the International Coordinator to accept the appointment
     of Henk Wolsink as the new FidoNews Editor effective with issue 1533,
     and am asking that the FidoNet Nodelist reflect this change.

     The reasons for my resignation have become obvious to many over the
     last few weeks as an ill-informed effort to force information out by
     coercion and harrassment in various echoes has taken a new and more
     menacing twist.

     In the fine traditions established by their apparent idols and role
     models of Winter and Germer in Zone 1, several have now moved beyond
     the realm of FidoNet and made the distinctive effort to force their
     ways into the private lives of others...even persons who are not a
     part of FidoNet.

     This includes a number of acts, including the distribution of a
     private phone number by persons once trusted; harrassment of a local
     businessman (who has never been involved in FidoNet in any form) by
     the posting of his private business phone; the distribution of a
     description of personal vehicles, as well as license numbers; the
     use of investigators to delve into the privacy of matters outside the
     realm of FidoNet or even myself; and, a credible claim that pictures
     have been taken of the interior of the home of the family that I rent
     from, as well as other less well-documented actions that have been
     observed or reported to me.

     All of this, simply because I hold opinions that are *different* from
     the 'mob mentality' currently engaged in the destruction of Zone 1
     FidoNet in the name of "democracy".

     What protection might have been offered by FidoNet Policy has been
     rendered useless by an administration more interested in how many
     hats someone wears than by what constitutes smooth operations and
     excessively annoying behavior.

     It seems that the idea of the free discussion of ideas in FidoNet has
     been replaced with the concept of the invasion of _personal_ privacy,
     and the posting of personal details that have nothing to do with Fido
     itself...or worse, with those who have nothing to do with whatever
     differences may exist.

     Moreso, the idea seems to be to 'argue the person' and not 'argue the
     idea'...nor are these attitudes directed at myself alone.

     This time, however, innocent bystanders are involved, and because of
     the threats being made, both directly and by inference, I cannot with
     good conscience risk the personal safety or the privacy of my
     landlords and friends beyond this point.
     FIDONEWS 15-32               Page 2                   10 Aug 1998


     Would that I had not had the recent surgery, and were able to move
     into my own residence, things would be different...but that is not
     the case, and I am otherwise helpless to act at this time to protect
     the family who has taken me in.

     But, I can at least let it be known the reasons _why_ I have been
     forced to take these actions.

     The past few issues have carried the title "This edition published
     under duress" for the simple reason that efforts of this sort were
     carried out not to benefit FidoNet, but rather to prevent me from
     posting my own opinions without endangering the privacy of others.

     And a free press is *critical* to any _real_ democracy, regardless
     of the self-serving mouthings by those who have engaged in this
     unprecedented effort to invade personal privacy.

     As a result, and effective with this issue's publication, I will
     withdraw from active participation in FidoNet, save in those echoes
     where I have previous commitments; as well, I will be considering
     my withdrawal from FidoNet altogether, since extortion, witchhunts
     and terrorism seem to be the new 'standard' by which we are being
     allowed to move towards.

     With that, I release the FidoNews to Henk Wolsink, in the hopes that
     a free press will not be smothered or threatened by remaining inside
     of Zone 1 any longer.

     Dear Editorbeing,

     This column is submitted by Doc Logger (163/110) who was
     busy drowning in the humid air mass that got lost and headed
     up here to the frozen tundra. I think the weatherbeings
     should send it back to Texas where it belongs.

     Roll  da flic Zorch....

     Dear Reverend Visage,

     Another slow week in Fidoland. The only amusing action has
     been in the petulant footstomping of Satti's second stringer
     in the Z1C elflord echo. It seems that Bowerman is
     attempting to remove the riffraff so that poor Satti won't
     get his tender sensitivities bruised when he wanders back
     into the echo. Satti messages haven't been seen for months
     in public and if he can perfect an equal cone of silence in
     private messages then he will have finally achieved his
     level of competence.

     Poor Bowerman is naive enough to accept a telephone bill as
     proof of His Zorchness' integrity. It wasn't that long ago
     that the lads in the Kohl troll kingdom were justifiably
     scoffing at the notion that a telephone number proved
     anything. Our prayers and our edible underwear should go out
     to Bowerman in his hour of delirium.

     There have been minor renewals of the perpetual discussion
     about what to do with the unwieldy dog of Peefour. A decent
     burial should be arranged with all possible haste but I
     don't think that this would satisfy those who don't want to
     assume responsibility and would rather have someone else
     make their choices for them via a series of stone tablets.

     I notice that an unimaginative soul has registered
     "fidonet.com" with Internic. Naturally, the choice of name
     is purely coincidence and has nothing to do with making
     ersatz claims on the real Fidonet. The morons who usurp
     existing and recognized names by registering them as
     Internet domains should be forced to go out on a date with
     Linda Tripp.

     This will have to be barely enough liner to cover the bird
     cage because Swamp Swine Magazine is sending me on a short
     kayak journey with a collection of deranged and drunken
     yuppies. My assignment is to ascertain how stupid people can
     get when a little liquor and wilderness are mixed. This
     pastime seems to reach a high art form when young
     professionals get away from the office and try to out macho
     each other by running into rocks. I shall be sure to bring

     my "Space Balls" CD with William Shatner's version of "Lucy
     In The Sky With Diamonds" so that the yuppies' last
     sensation on earth is suitably horrific...hell will seem
     comparatively pleasant.

     I must go, Visage, the sun is over the yard arm, and the
     driveway is filled with Hummers waiting to transport me
     beyond the heart of darkness.

     Hello!

     I have sent a CC to many FidoNodes. I hope that one of you will
     answer my question.

     I am a NC of 2:530.

     In the 2:530 there are some Down Nodes, and after a period of 2 weeks
     the nodes are removed from the nodelist.

     Some of them come back after a while, but they heave been removed
     from the nodelist.

     My question is:

     What should I do with them ? Should I put them to send me an Apply or
     should I add them form old nodelist ? What dose your NC in this
     situation?

     Please help me with an answer or send this message to somebody who
     can help me!

     Thanks,

     Subject: a few parting thoughts...
     Date: Tue, 4 Aug 1998 11:16:34 -0400

     To: <editor@fidonews.org>

     Hello Zorch.  Feel free to publish this.

     A few thoughts on how to get Fidonet's house of cards in order:

     1.  Get off of Bob Kohl's back for a few weeks, and let him get
     FIDONEWS 15-32               Page 7                   10 Aug 1998


     himself together.  You people aren't even so much as giving him a
     chance.  If you want Fidonet to be a democracy, you need to give the
     elected officials at least some chance to work.

     2.  When are we going to see Fidonet start advertising itself to the
     rest of the world?  Do you people expect users to just flock to
     Fidonet in droves without knowing that it even exists?  Someone take
     up a collection and put an ad in the New York Times or something.

     And last, but certainly not least...

     3.  Someone please tell Doc Logger to shut the hell up.  No one is
     listening to your childish taunts.

     Farewell, gentlemen.  Fare the well.

     Regards,
     Ed Lee

     Obituary = Scott Samet
     by Hector Santos, 1:135/382


     [Editor's Note:  Due to an attempt to hack into my E-Mail account by
     persons as yet unknown, the message originally sent by Andrea Santos
     was lost in the destruction, along with several non-FidoNews articles
     and messages.  With apologies to all involved, I have elected to post
     a copy of Hector Santos' announcement made in several echoes.  -zf-]


     People,

     Scott Samet , the author of one of the more popular FIDONET utilities
     called XLAXNODE.EXE and XLAXDIFF.EXE, has went to the better world.

     As you properly aware in some form or fashion, Scott was one of the
     original Fidonet developers (old address 1:135/990).  His Fidonet
     nodelist compiler was one of the original "hall mark" and "backbone"
     utilities that gave Fidonet one of its early "growth sparks" during
     the 80s.  Nearly every early know Frontend Mailer and/or Mail Echo
     Processor worked with the Nodelist Databases produced by Scott's
     utility.

     I first met Scott in 1984 when I first joined Fidonet. I purchased
     his nodelist compiler for $15.00, like most of the young Fidonet
     members did.  When I started to write Silver Xpress, the first
     Fidonet Offline Mail System, I added support for the compiled
     nodelist and Scott helped by adding support for some my new
     ideas.  Scott added support for the Silver Xpress compiled
     nodelist to XLAXNODE.EXE in subsequent updates.   That fact he
     was an enthusiastic Borland Pascal user and software developer like
     I was, our "Cyber" relationship was even better.  With his expert
     knowledge of Pascal, he helped me add some advance techniques to
     Silver Xpress.

     In October 1987, Scott left Fidonet but thousands of people
     around the globe, till this very day, continued to use his XLAXNODE
     nodelist utilities.

     As an original "hall mark" Fidonet Developer, all members of Fidonet
     deserves the attention of this news. Zorch Forsberg (FidoNews Editor)
     has been contacted, and Andrea Santos (1:3135/382) has informed our
     Net 135 members of the sad news.

     God Bless Scott

     PS: Thank you Borland for posting this information.

     Scott Samet, a member of TeamB and an active participant in this
     online community, died last week in his home town of Miami, Florida.

     Scott was a member of TeamB for three years. He loved being part of
     TeamB, enjoyed Delphi, and the online community. He loved travel,
     good food, and teaching his nephews about off-color jokes and
     belching. Scott had a finely honed sense of humor, and was always
     ready with a wry remark or pithy comment. Scott was never one to heed
     traditions, social conventions or fashion rules. He had a large and
     diverse group of friends who will miss him greatly, as will his
     family and colleagues.

     Scott was, most definitely, an interesting fellow. I am honored to
     have known him. He will be missed.
