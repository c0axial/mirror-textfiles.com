                      SILICON MOUNTAIN FIDO CONFERENCE
                         Colorado Spring, Colorado
                        August 14 through August 17


     Lots  of  things  are  going  on  with  the Silicon Mountain Fido
     Conference.  We are now working on a road race,  probably about 5
     K  in  length,  "See  Fido  Run."  This  would  be set for Sunday
     morning,  early enough to get a shower afterwards and still check
     out.  A  couple of days here in Colorado Springs should be enough
     to acclimate your bodies for this strenuous event.  Those persons
     who are not into running can cheer the others on.

     The Fido standards committee will be meeting at some time  during
     the  conference.  The standards committee may present a symposium
     and also meet privately.

     The program is still being worked on.  A tentative schedule is as
     follows:

         Thursday afternoon:
              Arrival.

     Present plans are to hold the conference at the Colorado  Springs
     Hilton  Inn.  A  single  or  double room (either single or double
     occupancy) is $60.00 per night up to  maximum  occupancy  of  two
     persons.  You  can  bring  a  spouse  and  share a single room or
     travel with a friend and share a double for the same  $60.00  per
     night,  or  $30.00 each per night.  If occupancy exceeds two (you
     might want to bring your children),  there will be  an  increased
     rate.

     Travel  arrangements  are  being  made  through  the Globe Travel
     Agency, which will be coordinating travel schedules and obtaining
     discount travel rates.  We are also trying to talk  Globe  Travel
     into   setting  up  a  special  Fido  node  for  handling  travel
     arrangements.  Contact Globe travel at the following number:

            Jack Armit

     United, TWA, Continental,  Frontier,  American and other airlines
     serve  Colorado  Springs  with direct flights from cities such as
     Chicago, Dallas, New York, Newark, St.  Louis, Washington,  D.C.,
     Los Angeles,  Phoenix,  and other cities.  Service through Denver
     is available from almost anywhere that has  an  airport.  If  you
     are  traveling from outside the United States,  you will probably
     be routed through New York or San  Francisco/Oakland.  There  are
     direct  flights  to  Denver  from  Toronto,  Montreal  and  other
     Canadian cities.  As the conference center is some distance  from
     the  airport,  we  need to know when you are coming in to get the
     hotel to provide ground transportation.

     Those of you who prefer to drive can take Interstate routes  most
     of  the  way.  The  conference  center  is right off I-25.  Major
     routes from the West are US 50 and US  24.  If  coming  from  the
     Southwest,  you  can follow the interstates East to I-25 and then
     north,  or go  through  the  mountains.  The  drive  through  the
     Colorado Mountains is a stunning experience,  but it does require
     you to take extra  time.  If  you  are  camping,  the  US  Forest
     Service  campgrounds are cheap and usually have space if you stop
     early (but you may have to carry your own drinking  water).  From
     San  Francisco,  route yourself across on US 40,  50,  or I-70 or
     I-80.  From  the  Pacific  Northwest,  stop  off  at  Yellowstone
     National  Park on the way or go south and pick up I-80.  From the
     East,  follow I-80 to Denver and then South,  or I-70  to  Limon,
     Colorado  and then East on Colorado 94.  From Texas,  stop off in
     Santa Fe,  New Mexico (reservations a must)  or  Albuquerque  and
     then come North on I-25.

     If  you  come  early  or  stay  late  and  have  four wheel drive
     vehicles,  you might want to go over some of  the  high  mountain

     passes  in the back country.  The snow will have melted enough to
     get through, and the weather should be good at that time of year.
     At higher elevations, the wild flowers may still be in bloom.

     The Fido net is  at  a  crossroads  in  its  development.  It  is
     expanding  at  an  extraordinary  rate.  Only your support of the
     Administrators will keep the Fido Net going over the  long  haul.
     The achievement of Tom Jennings,  Thom Henderson,  Ken Kaplan and
     Ben Baker and others in developing the Fido software and the Fido
     Net is amazing to us all.  It could not happen in a  totalitarian
     society.  Although  most  of  the  nodes  are in Europe and North
     America,  Indonesia,  which is primarily an Islamic nation,  also
     has  a net.  Fido,  like the micro-computer on which it is based,
     is a vehicle of personal freedom, regulated by the good sense and
     restraint of its users,  and it should  be  kept  that  way.  The
     primary  responsibilities for keeping Fido free and unleashed lie
     with the Fido Net Administrators,  Ken Kaplan and Ben Baker,  its
     author,  Tom Jennings,  and its editor,  Thom Henderson.  To keep
     Fido free and unleashed,  it is up to us to support them in their
     efforts.

     The  Colorado  Springs PC Users' Group (COSUG) is sponsoring this
     conference because it is a conference which should be  held,  and
     it  should  be  held  now.  The  Fido  Administrators  need help,
     including financial support.  The conference will give you all  a
     chance  to participate in structuring the Fido Net in the way you
     want and in determining the future of  the  network.  Please  put
     the conference on your calendar and make your reservations now.

     The  Hilton  Inn has requested that room reservations be provided
     it no later than August 1,  1986,  to obtain the conference rate.
     Reservations  will  be held until 6:00 P.M.  of the arrival date.
     To guarantee a room past that time,  you must give them a deposit
     or  a  guaranteed  reservation  on  your credit card number.  The
     address and phone number is on the reservation form,  which  will
     be  available  in  Fidonews.  You  should send me the reservation
     form,  either  by  U.S.  Mail  or  Fidomail.  Follow  up  with  a
     guaranteed  reservation direct with the Hilton Inn.  Also we need
     a head count for the banquet, luncheon,  and the Flying "W" ranch
     at least 48 hours in advance.  If you bring family members along,
     they  will  be  welcome.  Thom  Henderson  and Ken Kaplan will be
     bringing their wives, and many others will have their spouses and
     friends.  Some will have their children along also.

     Conferences and seminars used to promote  professional  education
     are tax deductible under U.  S. income tax regulations, which may
     help some with the expenses.  Your employer may also  be  willing
     to sponsor your trip.

     If  you  are coming from outside the U.S.,  check with the U.  S.
     embassey or consulate nearest you concering a tourist  visa.  For
     Canandians, this is no problem, but others will need to arrange a
     visa in advance.

     Please  send us a message as soon as possible to let us know that
     you intend to come.  We need to have a tentative count by the end

     of June.  This is the height of the tourist season  in  Colorado,
     and  we  need  to make sure the arrangements are in order for the
     conference.

     In Search Of....

               Wisdom.  What we  have  here  folks  is  one  extremely
     frustrated  sysop  with  a  broken (?) toy.  About 3 months ago I
     purchased a 85 meg Fujitsu drive (M2243AS) for my system and have
     had no luck getting it online.  I am trying  to  use  it  with  a
     WD1002SWX  HDC  with  the  auto-config  BIOS.  It works fine if I
     jumper the card to use default setting,  but that only gets it up
     as a 20 meg.  If I try to key in config info (754 cyl,  11 heads,
     etc) it asks for,  I get an immediate seek error upon  trying  to
     low  level  format.  When  configured  as  a  20  meg.  using the
     defaults it will run HDSPEED and other tests  with  no  problems,
     warm-reboot, etc.  Curious huh?

          Well, we're not licked yet.  I hope to get this beast up and
     configured as a couple 30+ Mb. drives one of these days with your
     help.  If  you  have  any experience with this combination please
     give us a  holler  via  the  net  or  direct  to  the  system  at
     707-545-0746.  Western  Digital swears it will work and I believe
     'em.  Do you know how?

             Minutes of the Third Net 109 Fido Sysops' Meeting
                                Compiled by
                               Michael Klein
                          Sysop of YAFIP (109/610)

        On May 31,  1986,  the Net 109 Fido  Sysops  had  their  Third
     meeting,   which  turned  out  to  be  the  most  productive  and
     informative yet.  The meeting was  held  at  Woodlake  Towers  in
     Falls Church, Virginia.  This article is an edited version of the
     file  MINUTES.TXT,  which  I  sent out to all the net 109 Sysops.
     Someone suggested that I submit it to the FidoNews,  so  here  it
     is.

        The  meeting  more or less got underway around 1310 (1:10 PM),
     with a few more people filtering in as  time  went  on.  After  a
     brief   welcome   from  Kurt,   we  went  around  the  room  with
     introductions.  If my memory  serves  me  correctly,  we  had  me
     (610),  Chris Rowley (631), Mike Wyrick and David Ross (449), Tim
     McArdle (122),  Joseph Collins (623),  Kurt (74  and  483),  Jack
     Liebsch  (468  and  605),  Cliff  Cummings and David Purks (603),
     Alexander Wall (606),  Andrew Bilski (611),  Jim Kay (612),  John
     Raum (601 and 632),  Steven Ranger (621), Chris Magyar (615), and
     Bob Catt (625), and Steve Fox (613 and 618), who also brought two
     new gentlemen who are planning  to  join  the  net  in  the  near
     future.

        Anyway,  let's  move  on to more important matters.  Our first
     topic of discussion was Fido Bugs (as usual).  Two main Bugs were
     brought up:

     1) When in the files section,  the  command  "A  1"  successfully
        changes  to file area 1.  However,  when any user EXCEPT those
        with Sysop access attempt to go there from the "File  Area  or
        Quit:"  prompt (as displayed when the A command is used on its
        own),  it does not allow access.  This is only  true  of  file
        area 1; all others work correctly.

     2) Andrew  Bilski  of  The Main Frame (611) mentioned that he was
        having problems with Fido's T)ype command in conjunction  with
        DoubleDOS.  He said that using a comport (COM1: or COM2:) with
        the  T)ype  command  caused  problems  with his system.  Other
        sysops present stated that this used to be a problem,  but had
        been  fixed somewhere along the lines.  It was dismissed as an
        individual fluke.

        After the Bug session was over,  we moved on to  the  area  of
     Fido "Extras" such as SEAdog,  OUTSIDE, EVENT, POLECAT, ECHOMAIL,
     and SERVER.

        Jim Kay (612) reported that he had purchased SEAdog,  used  it
     for awhile,  was not satisfied,  and sent it back for the offered
     refund.  His problems with it were:

     1) If a user hung up in Fido BEFORE logging on  completely,  Fido
        would reset without returning control to SEAdog.

     Fidonews                     Page 8                   23 Jun 1986


     2) Sometimes  when  Fido  returned control to SEAdog,  the latter
        would reset itself,  give the  "Waiting  for  Call  or  Event"
        message, and then hang the system until a boot was performed.

        Joseph Collins (623),  who also runs SEAdog,  said that SEAdog
     had never given him this (or any other) problem,  and that he was
     going to continue to use it.

        After  the short-lived but very informative SEAdog discussion,
     the topic area turned to that of ECHOMAIL.  We discussed this one
     at length (read:  "beat the topic  to  death"),  with  some  very
     enlightening  and  helpful results.  We talked about the existing
     ECHOMAIL setups that we have,  and worked out the major  bugs  in
     the linkup between 449,  610,  325,  622, 630, 615, 631, and 606.
     We also discussed  the  possibility  of  setting  up  a  Net-wide
     Sysops'  conference,  one  of  which  already  exists between the
     aforementioned 8 systems.  It would simply be a message base  for
     Sysops  to  pool  their ideas and thoughts without having to send
     individual messages to all the sysops separately.  More  info  on
     that as it develops.

        When that was over and done with,  we moved on to OUTSIDE.  We
     discussed the many ways that OUTSIDE is being used,  including  a
     way to check for messages in bulk,  list files,  play games,  and
     even take the infamous Purity Test online (which can be  done  on
     The Game Room,  109/449,  for those who care to check on it).  It
     was mainly  a  discussion  of  the  various  utilities  that  are
     available for use Outside of Fido.

         From  there,  we  moved  to  EVENT.  EVENT  is  a nice little
     utility that allows the sysop to update/edit the  Fido  scheduler
     using  a  standard  text  editor.  It  can  also be used to shift
     events forward/backward,  which helps with the switch in Daylight
     Savings  Time.  You  can also use it to add remarks to each event
     to keep track of what's what.  All in all, very handy.

         The conversation soon turned to SERVER,  which is an external
     utility  to  allow  certain  users  on  other  boards (with valid
     accounts on the home board) to request files during FidoNet time.
     It has it's potential uses,  but more for systems that deal  with
     mass  amounts of file requests and transfers between Fido systems
     than anything else.

          A very short topic that was brought up at  the  end  of  the
     Fido  Utility  discussion was that of POLECAT.  There is a bug in
     the Anonymous feature of  POLECAT  that  makes  the  messages  in
     question public (as it's supposed to), but doesn't change the TO:
     field  of the message to "Anonymous," which is it's main feature.
     However,  it is still a very handy utility to detect and  reroute
     undeliverable  private messages.  I have attempted to contact the
     P.O.L.E.  board in Dallas about  the  bug,  but  I've  gotten  no
     answer.

         That  about wraps it up for the talk we had about the various
     popular and not-so-popular utilities and extras to go along  with
     Fido.  We  then  went  on  to  things that relate more to the net
     Fidonews                     Page 9                   23 Jun 1986


     itself,  such as finding an Outbound Host,  Renumbering the  Net,
     and adding Hubs to the system.

         MDS  (122)  has  had  problems  in its ability to serve as an
     Outbound Host,  due to a non-functioning WATS line and a very bad
     data  connection  when  using their long distance service.  Chris
     Rowley offered the use of 631 as an Outbound  Host,  but  we  all
     decided it would be in everyone's best interest to wait until 122
     could get everything straightened out.

         The  idea of Renumbering the Net based on Geographic location
     (northern  nodes,  DC  local  nodes,   and  southern  nodes)  was
     mentioned, as was the possibility of renumbering based on type of
     system (i.e.  IBM,  DEC Rainbow,  etc.).  This idea was shot down
     after 5 minutes of discussion,  and we decided to leave  it  just
     the way it is.  Thus is progress.

         As for hubs, we decided that they would be unnecessary, as we
     already use them.  We just don't call them Hubs.  Noting the Hubs
     in the nodelist would take more trouble than it's worth,  and not
     accomplish anything of real value to the net, so this idea,  too,
     was  abandoned,  or  rather,  as  we say in the land of Fidomail,
     (ORPHANED).

         We also discussed the way in which the net  is  growing.  Net
     109 currently has 37 active nodes (probably even more this week),
     and  if the entire net keeps growing at this rate,  it may not be
     long before we reach LISTGEN's current limit of  1400  nodes.  If
     this  happens,  says Kurt,  we'll all have to switch to XLATRGEN,
     another nodelist generator that can handle more nodes.  Watch for
     it.

         The  final  discussion  topic  was   that   of   the   Second
     International  FidoNet Conference,  to be held sometime in August
     in Colorado Springs,  Colorado.  No major details were  given  on
     that, but the idea was tossed out for anyone interested.

        Contrary  to  how it may appear,  this turned out to be (in my
     opinion) the most informative and productive Sysops'  meeting  so
     far,  despite  John  Raum's narrow escape from the claws of death
     with aid from Bob Catt (actually,  he was locked in the bathroom,
     but  we'll  not go into that any further).  We concluded at about
     1535 (3:35 PM,  for those on 12 hour schedules)  and  decided  to
     hold the next meeting sometime in September at the same location.

                    ECHOMAIL, HOST-ROUTING, AND TOPOLOGY


     EchoMail is a utility that was developed on Rising Star  Fido  to
     perform  a  similar function to FidoNet news groups.  Remember my
     proposal,  quite a few issues ago,  that something be done to let
     several  Fidos  share  the  same message area?  It turns out that
     EchoMail was ALREADY in beta test at that time.  Since then,  the
     first  GOOD  working  version  (1.30)  has  been  released to the
     public.

     EchoMail uses two  programs  (Scanmail  and  Tossmail),  and  one
     parameter  file  called  AREAS.BBS.  For  the  sake  of having an
     example,   the  AREAS.BBS  on  WeirdBase  (Fido  100/523)   looks
     something like this:

              +---------------------------------------------+
              |  WeirdBase: St. Louis, MO - (314) 389-WYRD  |
              |  -                                          |

              |  10 SYSOP      10/620                       |
              +---------------------------------------------+

     Before the evening mail, I run Scanmail, which looks at every new
     entry  into any of the numbered message areas that is followed by
     one or more Fido net/node numbers,  and checks to see who  hasn't
     gotten  that  message yet.  If it finds one (or more),  it copies
     the message(s) into the netmail area and addresses them  to  that
     (those)  board(s).  Examples:  I enter a new message in area 4 on
     100/523.  It hasn't been seen by ANYBODY,  so  Scanmail  makes  3
     copies of it,  and addresses them to 12/4,  101/27,  and 107/316.
     In addition,  it adds the line  "AREA:MAGICK"  in  front  of  the
     message text, and the following two lines ...

     +---------------------------------------------------------------+
     |  * Origin: WeirdBase: St. Louis, MO - (314) 389-WYRD (100/523)|
     | SEEN-BY: 12/4 100/523 101/27 107/316                          |
     +---------------------------------------------------------------+

     ...  at the end of the message body,  so that nobody will forward
     copies of THIS message to 12/4, 101/27, 107/316, or back to me.

     After  the evening mail,  I run Tossmail,  which checks every new
     message in the netmail area looking on  line  one  for  the  word
     "AREA:"  followed by one of my area names (from AREAS.BBS).  Each
     one it finds,  it moves to that area  (stripping  off  the  AREA:
     line).

     Note  that if an AREA:MAGICK message originates on 107/316 and he
     Fidonews                     Page 11                  23 Jun 1986


     DOESN'T send a copy to 12/4, my board will forward a copy (adding
     12/4 to the SEEN-BY line) to 12/4,  but NOT back to 107/316.  The
     effect  is  that every message in an EchoMail area gets forwarded
     to every other board, creating a multi-board shared message area.
     This is what we mean by an EchoMail conference.


                             WHAT IS TOPOLOGY?

     Topology is a mathematical term meaning the  study  of  surfaces.
     It  has been usurped in computerese to mean the study of networks
     and  network  linkages.  Everybody  knows  the  standard  FidoNet
     topology (simplified here to only 4 nets):

      +-------------------------------------------------------------+
      |                          net A nodes                        |
      |                             \ /                             |
      |                         net A hosts                         |
      |                         /    |    \                         |
      |                        /     |     \                        |
      | net B nodes > net B hosts ------- net C hosts < net C nodes |
      |                        \     |     /                        |
      |                         \    |    /                         |
      |                         net D hosts                         |
      |                             / \                             |
      |                         net D nodes                         |
      +-------------------------------------------------------------+

     In topological terms, we would say that the individual nets had a
     "star"  topology  -  one node at the center,  that everybody gets
     mail from (and often,  sends mail through).  However,  the  hosts
     form  an  "amorphous"  (meaning "blob-like") topology - everybody
     sends to everybody.

     Well,  the bigger echomail  conferences  have  demonstrated  that
     EchoMail  can  bring this topology to its knees.  The inter-Sysop
     conference has 40+ nodes on it,  averaging (at least)  a  message
     per  night  per node.  With the standard FidoNet topology,  every
     host would be routing copies of these 40+ messages all  over  the
     net.  To speed things up, they have by-passed the "official" IFNA
     topology and created several "stars-on-a-string":

           +----------------------------------------------------+
           |   ... node - node - node - node - node - node ...  |
           |        |      |      |      |      |      |        |
           |  ... nodes  nodes  nodes  nodes  nodes  nodes ...  |
           +----------------------------------------------------+

     Where a half-dozen or more nodes send mail to each other (in mail
     slots  as small as 10 minutes) to pass it all the way up and down
     the line.  At any given time, only a FEW of the nodes are sending
     mail - few or no collisions.  Further, the messages for the other
     points of each node's "star" are created AT THE LOCAL  ECHO  HUB,
     reducing  the  amount  of traffic considerably.  (In other words,
     instead of sending 5 copies of a message to net 125, you send one
     copy to A SINGLE BOARD in net 125,  which  does  a  Toss/Scan  to
     Fidonews                     Page 12                  23 Jun 1986


     create the copies for the other four.)

     This  also  has  it's  disadvantages.  For  one thing,  even with
     streamlining deluxe, it's slow - 2 to 3 days to get mail from one
     end of the chain to another, a speed that barely rivals 1st Class
     mail.  (I have joked on occasion that  we  could  do  better  and
     almost as cheaply to copy the mail onto diskettes and mail them.)
     For  another thing,  it is indescribably complex.  In both of the
     largish conferences I participate in (one of which I  coordinate,
     the  MAGICK  conference),  up to half of the mail,  at times,  is
     dedicated just to negotiating a new topology.

     By the way,  despite what Josh said in his article,  this job  IS
     best  done by a central coordinator.  A camel is a horse designed
     by a committee - except that it seems unlikely to me as a systems
     analyst that any committee could design something  as  functional
     as  a  camel.  No,  the  coordinator  doesn't run rough-shod over
     people.  He merely prevents duplication of effort,  insures  that
     there are no loops in the conference, and takes full advantage of
     existing links to keep EVERYBODY'S costs as low as possible.


                     THE WHYS AND WHENS OF HOST-ROUTING

     Caveat  Number One:  I do not pretend to speak for the IFNA,  nor
     for any network host.  What you are about to  see  is  one  man's
     opinion.  It  is,  however,  an educated and thought-out opinion,
     which I am not sure can be said for the argument in issue 322.

     Nobody who knows anything about EchoMail would begin  to  pretend
     that  host-routing  is a good idea for large conferences.  When a
     conference is creating 40, 50 or more messages a night to a half-
     dozen or more nights,  EVERYONE (including the Echomailers) would
     be  better  off  by-passing  any  hosts  that  aren't part of the
     conference.

     But what about smaller conferences?  Tom Kenney (107/316), who is
     collecting a list of EchoMail conferences,  says he has a list of
     almost  70  different EchoMail conferences.  I'll wager LONG odds
     that the average number of cities per conference is just  a  tiny
     fraction  over  1.0,  and  that  the average number of boards per
     conference isn't much higher than 3.  And further,  I'll also bet
     that for all of those conferences that only have two or so boards
     involved, most of them generate LESS than 5 messages per night.

     Is there any net host,  anywhere in the FidoNet,  who is going to
     crash his disk and/or miss mail slots (in a one-hour range,  mind
     you)  because  of  a  packet containing 3 messages?  Even several
     such packets?  This seems especially true to  me  since  in  many
     such  cases,  including  BOTH  of  the  complaints  that  I  have
     personally received,  I am sure that most of those  nights  there
     was AT LEAST that much non-EchoMail traffic between St. Louis and
     those  two cities!  Why is there such irrational fear of EchoMail
     in general?  Why should very small,  low-volume conferences  have
     to forgo the advantages of message routing?

     Fidonews                     Page 13                  23 Jun 1986


     There  is  at least one good reason why they shouldn't!  When Tom
     Jennings created the current two-layer network topology,  the net
     was getting choked by the huge number of small mail packages that
     were  travelling back and forth.  Host-routing decreases not just
     mail COSTS,  but also message packeting and  phone-dialing  time,
     for EVERYONE.

     I  think that one of the big issues that needs to be discussed at
     the FidoNet conference in Colorado is just what level of  service
     the network hubs are committed to providing.  Here in St.  Louis,
     we were able to resolve the potential problem quite easily - when
     my  inbound  and  outbound volume got too large,  I discussed the
     matter with the relevant sysops,  and we settled on a  reasonable
     volume  of mail that they would accept for routing - beyond that,
     I'm on my own,  and quite understandably!  I think that it may be
     time  to  establish  a  NATIONAL  service level:  you may route x
     number of messages from your  board  to  any  one  net;  you  may
     receive y number of messages from other nets; and if your traffic
     exceeds  these  limits,  you  get  dropped  from the net into the
     region (or even dropped from the net altogether).


                               POST-SCRIPTUM

     Since this is (unless somebody beats me into FidoNews)  the  most
     detailed  description  of  EchoMail  to  date,  I  think I should
     mention a few basic rules of courtesy:

     1)  If you want to join a conference,  send a netmail message  to
         its  coordinator  or  contact-person.  NEVER NEVER NEVER send
         EchoMail without permission!  If you don't know the topology,
         you could end up  cascading  your  message(s)  all  over  the
         network.  I  broke  this  rule,  and I found out the hard way
         what would happen.  Don't you learn the hard way, too.

     2)  Until this mess is straightened  out,  don't  route  EchoMail
         through  your out-bound hub,  or even through somebody else's
         in-bound hub,  unless you have personally checked  with  both
         hubs  to  make sure that the increase in volume is all right.
         Apparently, you need to follow this rule even if your message
         volume is only  one  or  two  messages  per  night.  Until  a
         service level is established, you break this rule at your own
         risk.

     3)  An EchoMail conference is a lousy place for private mail.  If
         you have something private to say,  send it via netmail.  For
         one thing,  "private" mail can be read by EVERY  sysop  along
         the chain.  For another, why should a private message for one
         person  be  routed  to  6,  7,  or  even 40 boards?  For your
         convenience?  How about OUR convenience, tovarisch?

     4)  EchoMail is the greatest thing to hit Fido in  it's  history.
         EchoMail  gives  us  better  messaging capabilities than many
         larger networks, such as UseNet.  EchoMail is brand new - and
         neither bug-free, nor well-integrated into the FidoNet.  Next
         year,  things will be different.  In  the  mean  time,  we're
     Fidonews                     Page 14                  23 Jun 1986


         still  learning  just  how  nice (and occasionally,  just how
         dangerous) our new toy can be.  Be patient and be reasonable,
         and consider the present to be (what it is,  namely) a  Grand
         Experiment.

     Bill Jones, 105/10

                         WHO READS FIDONEWS ANYWAY?


     There have been a lot of comments  made  about  the  600  billion
     readers  of  FidoNews,  and being a sysop of large traffic Fido I
     have  come  to  the  conclusion  that  this  number  is  slightly
     exaggerated.  I  would  say that if you subtracted the sysops the
     number would be a bit closer to 2.

     Now,  I don't mean to sound like FidoNews is a  waste.  Far  from
     it!  I  just  don't think many users are getting the benefit they
     should be.

     What I started doing way back with issue 310 was editing out  the
     articles  and  editorials  that  I thought the average user might
     enjoy or benefit from.  I didn't extract the ads or  basic  sysop
     orientated  articles.  Then using WRITEMSG I entered the articles
     into my new message area FIDO_NEWS, complete with authors name as
     sender and All as recipient.

     Now I have a well-read message area of interest to everyone,  and
     feel that I'm finally passing on others hard work and insight.

     To carry this a step further,  NET 105 and 146 has started  using
     EchoMail  to share some of our areas and I'm pleased that most of
     the nodes also wished to have a  FIDO_NEWS  area,  of  which  I'm
     currently the moderator so we don't create massive duplication of
     the same articles.

     On the topic of EchoMail,  it is now possible to echo messages up
     to 200 lines long with version 1.30.  With version 1.1 the  limit
     was 100 lines,  and I had to create parts 1 and 2 for some of the
     messages.

     I uploaded a very short basic  program  to  the  Fido  with  both
     Kermit  and  Xmodem.  I  then  downloaded both versions with both
     Kermit and Xmodem.  To my surprise,  everything ran ok.  The only
     thing  peculiar  is  some  garbage  you  get after the command to
     download:

     KERMIT transfer
     Ready to send easter.bas
     14 blocks, 00:13 transfer time
     Start now, or Control-C to abort
      S~H @-#N1~2

     I then downloaded the program (axelf.bas) we tested the other day
     with both Xmodem and Kermit.  The Xmodem version ran.  The Kermit
     version returned an error message "Direct Statement in File"  and
     would not run.

     Tom's Response:

     The "garbage" is the initial Kermit NAK packet.  Ignore it.  Fido
     should  delay  5 - 10 secs before outputting,  but the problem is
     merely cosmetic.

     The Kermit vs.  Xmodem thing:  after repairing the "good"  kermit
     source  from Columbia,  I no longer trust any Kermit except mine.
     The one I had had a bug in the repeat count prefixing  code.  The
     string  "~~"  in  the file got converted into 96 "~" instead,  or
     something like that.  Try disabling  REPEAT  COUNT  PREFIXING  if
     possible  in  Xtalk.  In  any  case,  I  can't debug from "direct
     statement in file" error msgs,  I need  binary  file  comparisons
     reports,  etc.  This  is one to watch,  rather than worry about I
     think. There may be a problem remaining in Fido Kermit.

     Problem: Fidonet message problem

     I was trying to reply to a  message  sent  to  me  by  name.  The
     original message came from 125/509 and was addressed to me as Jim
     Brooker  rather  than  Sysop.  The  message  was  from  Sysop  at
     Fidonews                     Page 17                  23 Jun 1986


     125/509.  When I entered the (r) command to  reply,  the  message
     showed  that  the  message  was going TO Jim Brooker at Fido node
     125/509. ??

     Tom's Response:

     Its not a bug.  Fido tries to avoid the case:

     From: Joe Shmoe
     To: Joe Shmoe
     Subj: ...

     Normally, Fido tries to reply to the person who sent you the msg.
     For example,  if you are MIKE,  and you got a msg  from  JOE,  it
     would look like:

     From: JOE
     To:   MIKE
     Subj: ...

     As Mike, you want the msg to go to JOE. No sweat.

     The  problem  is  when  the  to and from names are the same;  its
     almost always "SYSOP".  I wish I had never  set  "SYSOP"  as  the
     default name in the user list.  A serious mistake.  For example:

     From: SYSOP
     To:   MIKE

     If  you  are  MIKE,  the reply works as above.  Again,  no sweat.
     However,  if you are also SYSOP,  and you reply to this msg (even
     if  it  isn't you) Fido would generate a msg from SYSOP to SYSOP.
     Not good. In this case, Fido uses, blindly, the To: field.

     The problem is usually two things:  (1)  the  same-name  problem,
     above, and (2) confusion over Fido "knowing" who people are.  All
     Fido  knows  about  is the result of a string compare;  it has no
     idea what anything is,  never mind human  identity.  Humans  even
     have trouble with that.

     The solution: stop using SYSOP as a name!

     Here  is  an  example of the false disk full error.  It is always
     proceeded by an aborted message.  After this  I  logged  off  and
     dialed in again and sent the message without error.

     ie.:
     DISK  FULL:  Cannot  save  your message!  Delete some old msgs to
     make room and start again Error saving message to Fido 107/414

     Tom's Response:

     Fidonews                     Page 18                  23 Jun 1986


     This appears to be a genuine bug.  Some file left  open  or  some
     such rubbish.  It may depend on lots of things, too.  I know I've
     aborted msgs and immediately reentered them without trouble.

     Make sure that there are FILES = 20 in CONFIG.SYS,  for starters.
     If doubleDOS, etc is running, all bets are off.

     I'll wait for further details.  Ill try this myself,  see what  I
     can do. It will probably be "interesting" ...
     -----------------------------------------------------------------
     From:   Sysop  on  115/100,   Illini  Data  R  of  Chicago  Area,
     Bolingbrook IL     Subj: Fido bug

     Fido 11w and under all predict the correct Kermit  file  transfer
     time and then multiply it by THREE TIMES.

     Whenever  ending  an  XMODEM  file transfer,  Fido says "Timeout"
     which usually indicates an error not an EOF.

     When "file transfer information" is enabled you cannot  tell  how
     large  the  entire  transfer is - it has scrolled off the screen.
     When disabled, there is no way to see how far along it is.

     Command stacking the "Sysop | Y Password" still does not work.

     Fido only checks daily time limits at logon.  If Daily is 40  and
     per call is 40,  user can login for 39,  hangup,  and get another
     40.  TJ should check this as often  as  he  checks  time  of  the
     current call.  Same problem with download limits.

     For  the USRobotics Courier Fido should send "M3" (sound on after
     dialing before connection) rather than  "M0"  (always  off).  The
     Courier  has  a  nice volume knob - let the users decide how loud
     (if at all) they want the modem to be.

     Tom's Response:

     Kermit time: its not on purpose, I assure you.  I do try to "lie"
     on the  slow  side,  but  not  300%!  More  like  20%.  Its  very
     difficult to judge Kermit times,  as there is no 1:1 relationship
     to file size and bytes transferred. I will look at it, I probably
     have a fudge factor in there I can adjust.

     Xmodem Timeout: it doesn't always happen, it doesn't here ...  it
     is  a  problem  w/  the  d/l program.  There is supposed to be an
     ACK/NAK sequence on the final EOT.  The  EOT  (from  the  sender)
     means  "no  more  data,  you  got it all",  which the receiver is
     supposed to ACK or NAK.  Many  communication  programs  don't  do
     this. The file xfer works fine.

     The  other possibility is that the receiver is taking a long time
     to close up the file just received, and is ACKing, but after Fido
     stops waiting.  (Fido doesn't wait too long,  cuz  many  programs
     don't do this sequence, as mentioned above, and it would take too
     long to time out!)

     Fidonews                     Page 19                  23 Jun 1986


     In other words:  don't worry about it.  Or, set more BUFFERS = on
     the receivers end (if its a floppy.)

     The file transfer stuff on the local console is for  debug,  etc.
     Its not Fido status, so its not broke.  Its a long story ... Fido
     is  so  tight  for space (8086 segmentation) that I had to remove
     stuff ...

     Will check out command stacking:  "SYSOP  |  Y  password"  should
     work.

     Yes, on daily and download limits. I give the user the benefit of
     the doubt. It wont be changed, too many ramifications for testing
     etc at this late date.  I think this is in the manual, but it may
     not be.

     USR  Courier:  let  the  user  do  stuff  like that.  Put ATM3 in
     FIDOMDM.BBS.   Most  people  just  don't  want  to  hear   modems
     screaming and dialing.  Or at least, get sick of it after a night
     or two.  This is all documented in the manual.

     From:  Chris Goodman on 153/101, Datanet of BCNet, Delta BC

     I  think  I  have discovered a bug in Fido version 11w.  When one
     attempts to download a file that  isn't  ASCII  using  the  ASCII
     download it reports back :

                 C:\????????\????????.COM is NOT a text file!
                 Sent 1 files OK
                 One or more files not sent

     Tom's Response:

     Yep ... it's a bug! Its supposed to say:

     PROGRAM.COM is not a text file!
     One or more files not sent

     Not the pathname (!) nor the "1 files sent OK". I
     will fix this, if I remember to!
