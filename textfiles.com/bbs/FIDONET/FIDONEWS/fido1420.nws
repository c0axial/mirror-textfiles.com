     The ZEC Election did get called off in Zone 1. ZEC1 now has a
     temporary appointee. The ZEC Echo has a temporary Moderator. The
     more things change the more they stay the same.

     Unfortunately, there is still no International Coordinator. But do we
     really need one after all? Do we need any of these Coordinators?

     The Technical section contains no old stuff this week. There's a
     batch of new stuff from Z2. What a relief. [grin]

     There has been only one response to the call for sources for old
     Nodelists from last week's Issue. It appears later. If you have
     old Nodelists available on your system or webpage, please let us
     know by sending in a note to FidoNews or a file with the .ANS
     extension for Answer of the Week.

     The R19 page moved again and there is a new entry for REC17 in the
     Internet section. There is still no update for the ZEC2 page.

     Bulletin Boards vs the InterNet

     by Bobby Darin, (1:285/82.0), Bellevue, NE

     There has been much about the death of Fido-Net lately in different
     sysop conferences.  These premature death calls I think are both over
     rated and short lived.  The largest group of such claim are coming
     from the InterNet circle.

     The InterNet -- We hear about it everywhere.  We know what it is, but
     do we really know what it is not?  Hopefully, I will describe what the
     InterNet is not.  I have been in the computer arena since way back
     when.... about 17 years.  In the early days of computers, things were
     very different from the way they are now as I'm sure they are going to
     be different in the future.  The biggest difference, in my opinion,
     are the trends.  I believe the InterNet is just another trend, like
     the Atari 2600, the Commodore 64, and much like the Sega systems of
     today.

     While these trends have come and gone - old trends being replaced with
     new ones, the bulletin board community has not "come and gone." Since
     RBBS' first release, the bulletin board or BBS has been a steady and
     stable platform for communications.

     Its rather ironic how the faltering trends have always said the BBS
     was dead.  When in actuality, it was they who where dying.  I
     personally have been a BBS sysop for 11 years and have seen many
     changes.  Perhaps none as dramatic as the InterNet.  Since its
     commercialization I have constantly watched it embroil its self in a
     tangled web of various crimes, from QUAKE being stolen off of their
     home page to people being murdered and children being molested.

     If this is the future of communications, then I'll gladly accept my
     place in a dying bread of computer users.  I can honestly say the
     worse thing that happened on my system is I got complaint because the
     users did not like my ANSI.

     I feel the InterNet (in its current state) will not be able to hold
     its captive audiences the way it does now for the following reason.

     This is probably my greatest complaint against the InterNet. There are
     inadequate measure to provide a secure environment for children. Many
     companies have jumped on the band wagon of writing programs the can
     supposedly block sites.  This is total gibberish.  Companies selling
     paranoia in place of proper parental guidance is idiotic. The level of
     greed in these companies ask for their "programs" is just as
     preposterous.  Filters and blockers are NOT the answer to controlling
     unwanted garbage on the InterNet.

     If we wanted to rid the InterNet of the kind of trash (pornography in
     inappropriate places, child molesters, and scam artists) then we first
     must deal with reputable InterNet Service Providers (ISP) and rid the
     FIDONEWS 14-20               Page 3                   19 May 1997


     market of ISPs that only want to line their pockets.  An ISP that will
     let any one on for the money is 75% of the reason as to why the
     InterNet has become what it is.

     Adult material has its place, but NOT in a missing child news group or
     of a similar place.  At one time I was devout reader of MISSING_CHILD,
     after the InterNet connection was made, the trash that came from the
     InterNet was intolerable.  I no longer carry the echo. I do NOT like
     the idea of my users reading about how some moron who supposedly raped
     a ten year old girl, especially since my system is family oriented.

     I like it even less when ISP such as AOL call the NewsGroups (message
     areas) Bulletin Boards.  Not only do they drop their unwanted trash in
     the NewsGroups, but they have the audacity to compare themselves with
     the Bulletin Board community.  Talk about a frame up, they pollute and
     WE (the true Bulletin Boards) get the black eye.  This is truly
     pathetic.

     We all know about acid boards, pirate BBSes, and hackers clubs.  They
     have been around since the start of the Bulletin Board circuit.  None
     of these, in my opinion, even remotely have damaged the integrity of
     the BBS community compared to the InterNet.

     I have no place for anarchy, chaos, unruliness.  These three
     components are the heart of the demise of the InterNet.  The InterNet
     has its place, but NOT as the expense of our morals and dignity.  I
     believe the InterNet will survive ONLY if the ISP owners take more
     community responsibility.  The lawlessness of the InterNet will be its
     own undoing.

     Proposed Update of FTS-0001 Product Codes
     by Lee Kindness, 2:259/7

     The following text is an updated section of fts-0001.016 to allow use
     of 16 bit product codes. 16bit product codes used in type 2+_ and
     type 2.2 packet headers break a type 2 8bit product code. This
     solution preserves the 8 bit code while permitting a 16 bit code.
     Changes are marked by '|'

     This was submitted to the FTSC over 7 months ago with no result. If
     a 'new FTSC' is reading then consider this a submission. Keep me
     posted.

        1. Network Layer Data Definition : the Packet Header

           The  packet contains messages in packed format to be transferred
           over the  net during a connection.  As this data structure is
           transferred, its definition is critical to FidoNet.

           A  packet may contain zero or more packed messages.  A packet
           without messages is often generated as a poll packet.

           Every  packet begins with a  packet header.  The fields of the
           packet header are of fixed length.

     |   document have been marked by ':' the the leftmost column.

         This document defines the format and content of the nodelist for
         the Public FidoNet Network (PFN) as published on Friday of each
         week. This format is historically known as the "St. Louis nodelist
         format".

         The PFN is an international network of independently owned
         electronic mail systems, most with interlocking electronic
         bulletin board systems. The distribution nodelist, or simply
         "nodelist", is the glue which holds the network together. It is
         the PFN's "phone book" and it defines the top-level network
         structure and is the means by which FidoNet retains its integrity
         as a point-to-point mail network.


     THE NODELIST

         The nodelist is published as an ASCII text file named
         NODELIST.nnn, where nnn is a three digit number representing the
         day-of-year of the Friday publication date, with zeros filling
         positions to the left if necessary. This file is packed into a
         archive file named NODELIST.?nn, where 'nn' are the last two
         digits of day-of-year, and the character at the position of the
         '?' indicating the type of compression used. Conventions as to
         which compression method is used for the distributed nodelist is
         a matter of local policy and is usually determined by each zone's
     |   Zone Coordinator. Common conventions are:

     |        NODELIST.Znn  :   Zip
     |        NODELIST.Ann  :  Arc
     |        NODELIST.Lnn  :  Lzh/Lha
     |        NODELIST.Jnn  :  ARJ

         As stated above, NODELIST.nnn is an ASCII text file. It contains
         two kinds of lines; comment lines and data lines. Each line is
         terminated with an ASCII carriage return and line feed character
         sequence, and contains no trailing white-space (spaces, tabs,
         etc.). The file is terminated with a DOS end-of-file character
         (character value 26 decimal, or "control-Z").

         Comment lines contain a semicolon (;) in the first character
         position followed by zero or more alphabetic characters called
         "interest flags". A program which processes the nodelist may use
         comment interest flags to determine the disposition of a comment
         line. The remainder of a comment line (with one exception,
         treated below) is free-form ASCII text. There are five types of
         comments flags:

             ;S This is of particular interest to Sysops
             ;U This is of particular interest to BBS users
             ;F This should appear in any formatted "Fido List"
             ;A This is of general interest (shorthand for ;SUF)
             ;E This is an error message inserted by the nodelist generator
             ; This comment may be ignored by a nodelist processor

     FIDONEWS 14-20               Page 8                   19 May 1997


         The first line of a nodelist is a special comment line containing
         identification data for the particular edition of the nodelist.
         The following is an example of the first line of a nodelist:

     ;A FidoNet Nodelist for Friday, July 3, 1987 -- Day number 184 : 15943

         This line contains the general interest flag, the day, date, and
         three-digit (zero-filled) day-of-year number of publication, and
         ends with a 5 digit decimal number with leading zeros, if
         necessary. This number is the decimal representation of a check
         value derived as follows:

             Beginning with the first character of the second line, a
             16 bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is calculated for the
             entire file, including carriage return and line feed
             characters, but not including the terminating EOF
             character. The check polynomial used is the same one used
             for many file transfer protocols:

                         2**16 + 2**12 + 2**5 + 2**0

         The CRC may be used to verify that the file has not been edited.
         The importance of this will become evident in the discussion of
         NODEDIFF, below. CRC calculation techniques are well documented
         in various technical references, and will not be treated further
         here.

         The content of the remaining comments in the nodelist are
         intended to be informative. Beyond the use of interest flags for
         distribution, a processing program need not have any interest in
         them.

         A nodelist data line contains eight variable length "fields"
         separated by commas (,). No space characters are allowed in a
         data line, and underscore characters are used in lieu of spaces.
         The term "alphanumeric character" is defined as the portion of
         the ASCII character set from 20 hex through 7E hex, inclusive.
         The following discussion defines the contents of each field in a
         data line.


       Field 1: Keyword

         The keyword field may be empty, or may contain one of the
         following:

         Zone

             Begins the definition of a geographic zone and define its
             coordinator. All the data lines following a line with the
             "Zone" keyword down to, but not including, the next
             occurrence of a "Zone" keyword, are regions, networks, and
             nodes within the defined zone.  Node entries defined
             immediately after the "Zone" keyword and before the next
             region or host entry are known as zone administrative nodes.
             These are allocated by the Zone Coordinator for use by nodes
     FIDONEWS 14-20               Page 9                   19 May 1997


             in the entire zone; for example, mail gateways between
             FidoNet zones.

         Region

             Begins the definition of a geographic region and defines
             its coordinator. All the data lines following a line with
             the "Region" keyword down to,  but not including,  the
             next occurrence of a "Zone",  "Region",  or "Host"
             keyword, are independent nodes within the defined region.

         Host

             Begins the definition of a local network and defines its
             network coordinator. All the data lines following a line
             with the Host keyword down to, but not including, the
             next occurrence of a "Zone", "Region",  or "Host" keyword,
             are local nodes, members of the defined local network.

         Hub

             Begins the definition of a routing sub-unit within a
             multi-level local network. The hub is the routing focal
             point for nodes listed below it until the next occurrence
             of a "Zone", "Region", "Host", or "Hub" keyword. The hub
             entry MUST be a redundant entry, with a unique number, for
             one of the nodes listed below it, within its hub segment.
             This is necessary because some nodelist processors
             eliminate these entries in all but the local network.

         Pvt

             Defines a private node with unlisted number. Private nodes
             are only allowed as members of local networks.

     |   Point

     |       Defines a private point off a node. Should not be used in
     |       the Fidonet nodelist, but rather private 'pointlists',
     |       local net level nodelists and nodelists in other Fidonet
     |       technology networks.

         Hold

             Defines a node which is temporarily down. Mail may be sent
             to it and is held by its host or coordinator.

         Down

             Defines a node which is not operational. Mail may NOT be
             sent to it. This keyword may not be used for longer than
             two weeks on any single node, at which point the "down"
             node is to be removed from the nodelist.

         <empty>

     FIDONEWS 14-20               Page 10                  19 May 1997


             The field contains no text (not the sequence "<empty>"),
             and defines a normal node entry.

         Only one of these may be used in any individual data line.


     | Field 2: Zone/Region/Net/Node/Point number

         This field contains only numeric digits and is a number in the
         range of 0 to 32767. If the line had the "Zone", "Region", "Host"
     |   or "Point" keyword, the number is the zone, net, region or point
         number, and the node has an implied node number of 0. Otherwise,
         the number is the node number. The zone number, region or net
         number, and the node number, taken together, constitute a node's
         FidoNet address.

         Zone numbers must be unique. Region or net numbers must be unique
         within their zone, hub numbers unique be within their net, node
         numbers unique within their net (and region, for regional
         independent nodes, zone for zone administrative entries).
         Duplicate node numbers under different hubs within the same net
     |   are not allowed. Point numbers must be unique within their node.


       Field 3: Node name

         This field may contain any alphanumeric characters other than
         commas and spaces. Underscores are used to represent spaces, and
         a comma delimits the end of the field. This is the name by which
         the node is known, usually as determined by the node or the
     |   coordinator responsible for compiling the segment. For zone,
     |   region and host entries this field should indicate its (rough)
     |   geographical area.


       Field 4: Location

         This field may contain any alphanumeric characters other than
         commas and spaces. Underscores are used to represent spaces. This
         field contains the location of the node. It is usually expressed
         as the primary local location (town, suburb, city, etc.) plus an
         identifier of the regional geopolitical administrative district
         (state, province, department, county, etc.). Wherever possible,
         standard postal abbreviations for the major regional district
         should be used (IL, BC, NSW, etc.).


       Field 5: Sysop name

         This field may contain any alphanumeric characters other than
         commas and spaces. Underscores are used to represent spaces. This
     |   is the name of the SYSTEM OPERATOR, entries such as "postmaster",
     |   "uucp" and aliases are not permitted.


       Field 6: Phone number
     FIDONEWS 14-20               Page 11                  19 May 1997


         This field contains at least three and usually four numeric sub-
         fields separated by dashes (-). The fields are country code, city
         or area code, exchange code, and number. The various parts
         of the phone number are frequently used to derive cost and
         routing information, as well as what number is to be dialed. A
         typical example of the data in a phone number field is 1-800-555-
         1212, corresponding to country 1 (USA), area 800
         (inbound WATS), exchange 555, and number 1212.

         Alternatively, this field may contain the notation
     |   "-Unpublished-" in the case of a private node or point. In this
     |   case, the keyword "Pvt" or "Point" must appear at the start of
         the line.


       Field 7: Baud rate

         This field contains one of the values: 300, 1200, 2400, 9600,
         19200, or 38400.

         This baud rate is indicative only of the maximum baud rate that
         may be expected when connecting to a node and is generally of use
         only where a calling node needs to adjust the baud rate used to
         dial to the caller's modem speed in order to achieve a
         connection, a requirement that with modem technology available in
         1996 is rarely if ever needed. This information is largely
         superseded by modem protocol flags (see next section) where any
         two nodes using a common protocol may have other expectations
         with regards to actual transfer rates. Use of the baud rate field
     |   alone is therefore depreciated. FSC-0091 should be consulted with
     |   regard to the special use of '300'


       Field 8 - Flags

         This optional field contains data about the specific operation of
         the node, such as file requests, modem protocol supported, etc.
         Any text following the seventh comma on a data line is taken
         collectively to be the flags field. The required format is zero
         or more sub-fields, separated by commas. Each sub-field consists
     |   of a flag, possibly followed by a value. Entries here are update
     |   to or succeeded in the epilogue of the Nodelist. The flags field
     |   has no maximum size.

         The following flags define special operating conditions:

            Flag    Meaning

            CM      Node accepts mail 24 hours a day
            MO      Node does not accept human callers
            LO      Node accepts calls only from valid listed node
                    numbers in the current FidoNet nodelist


         The following flags define modem protocols supported:

         The following flags define the type(s) of compression of mail
     |   packets supported plus message encoding.

             Flag    Meaning

             MN      No compression supported
     |       ENC     The node accepts inbound encrypted mail

             NOTE:   While FidoNet nodes usually exchange mail
                     using a variety of different file compression
                     formats negotiated between individual systems, the
                     presence of this flag indicates the INABILITY TO
                     RECEIVE MAIL compressed using the SEA ARC version 5
                     compression format and/or named according to the
                     ARCmail 0.6 mail bundle naming method. This is, by
                     convention, the most common mail compression format
                     in use within FidoNet. The presence of this flag
                     would normally indicate that all mail should be sent
                     uncompressed unless there is some overriding
                     arrangement with the receiving system.

         The following flags indicate the types of file and file update
         requests supported.

             Flag    Meaning

             XA      Bark and WaZOO file/update requests
             XB      Bark file/update requests, WaZOO file requests
             XC      Bark file requests, WaZOO file file/update
             XP      Bark file/update requests
             XR      Bark and WaZOO file requests
             XW      WaZOO file requests
             XX      WaZOO file/update requests


         The following flag defines gateways to other domains (mail
         networks).

             Flag    Meaning

             Gx..x   Gateway to domain 'x..x', where 'x..x` is a string
                     of alphanumeric characters.

             NOTE:   Valid values for 'x..x' are assigned by the FidoNet
                     International Coordinator or the person appointed as
                     Internetworking Coordinator by the FidoNet

                     International Coordinator. Current valid values of
                     'x..x' may usually be found in the notes at the end
                     of the current FidoNet nodelist. The most common
                     gateway flag is "GUUCP", to denote a gateway to the
                     Internet mail system that gates on behalf of the
                     fidonet.org internet domain.


         The following flags define the dedicated mail periods supported.
         They have the form "#nn" or "!nn" where nn is the UTC hour the
         mail period begins, '#' indicates Bell 212A compatibility, and
         '!' indicates incompatibility with Bell 212A.

             Flag    Meaning

             #01     Zone 5 mail hour (01:00 - 02:00 UTC)
             #02     Zone 2 mail hour (02:30 - 03:30 UTC)
             #03     Zone 4 mail hour (08:00 - 09:00 UTC)
             #09     Zone 1 mail hour (09:00 - 10:00 UTC)
             #18     Zone 3 mail hour (18:00 - 19:00 UTC)
             #20     Zone 6 mail hour (20:00 - 21:00 UTC)

             NOTE:   When applicable, the mail period flags may be strung
                     together with no intervening commas, e.g.. "#02#09"
                     or "!02!09". Only mail hours other than that
                     standard within a node's zone should be given. Since
                     observance of mail hour within one's zone is
                     mandatory, it should not be indicated.

         The following flag defines user-specific values. If present,
         this flag MUST be the last flag present in a nodelist entry.

             Flag    Meaning

             Ux..x   A user-specified string, which may contain any
                     alphanumeric character except blanks. This string
     FIDONEWS 14-20               Page 15                  19 May 1997


                     may contain one to thirty-two characters of
                     information that may be used to add user-defined
                     data to a specific nodelist entry.

             NOTE:   Ux..x flags are the mechanism by which new flags may
                     be experimentally introduced into the nodelist for a
                     trial period to assess their worth. They are
                     therefore of a temporary nature, and after their
                     introduction they are eventually either promoted
                     to a non-U flag or dropped from use altogether.

     |   The FTSC recognizes that the FidoNet International Coordinator(IC)
         is the ultimate authority over what appears in the FidoNet
         nodelist.  Also, FTSC is by definition a deliberative body, and
         adding or changing a flag may take a considerable amount of time.
         Therefore, the FidoNet International Coordinator may temporarily
         make changes or additions to the flags as defined in this
         document. The FidoNet International Coordinator will then consult
         with FTSC over the changes needed to this document to reflect
         these temporary changes.

     THE NODEDIFF

         With more than thirty-five thousand nodes as of this date (1996),
         the nodelist, even in archive form, is a document of substantial
         size. Since distribution of the nodelist occurs via electronic
         file transfer, this file is NOT routinely distributed. Instead,
         when a new nodelist is prepared weekly, it is compared with the
         previous week's nodelist, and a file containing only the
         differences is created and distributed.

         The distribution difference file, called NODEDIFF.nnn, where nnn
         is the day-of-year of publication, is actually an editing script
         which will transform the previous week's nodelist into the
         current nodelist. A definition of its format follows:

         The first line of NODEDIFF.nnn is an exact copy of the first line
         of LAST WEEK'S nodelist (i.e. the first line of the nodelist to
         which the current difference file applies). This is used as a
         first-level confidence check to insure that the correct file is
         being edited. The second and subsequent lines are editing
         commands and data.

         There are three editing commands and all have the same format:

       <command><number>

         <command> is a 1 letter command, one of A, C, or D.

     FIDONEWS 14-20               Page 16                  19 May 1997


         <number> is a decimal number greater than zero, and defines the
         number of lines to be operated on by the command. Each command
         appears on a line by itself. The commands have the following
         meanings:

             Ann     Add the following nn lines to the output file.
             Cnn     Copy nn unchanged lines from the input to the output
                     file.
             Dnn     Delete (or skip) nn lines from the input file.

         The following illustrate how the first few lines of a
         hypothetical NODEDIFF.213 might look:

             ;A Friday, July 25, 1986 -- Day number 206 : 27712
             D2
             A2
             ;A Friday, August 1, 1986 -- Day number 213 : 05060
             ;A
             C5

         This fragment illustrates all three editing commands. The first
         line is the first line from the previous nodelist, NODELIST.206.
         The next line says "delete the first two lines" from
         NODELIST.206. These are the identification line and the line
         following it. The next command says "add the next two lines" to
         NODELIST.213 at the "current" location. The two data lines are
         followed by a command which says "copy five unchanged lines" from
         NODELIST.206 to NODELIST.213. Notice that the first line added
         will ALWAYS contain the new nodelist CRC, so that the software
         applying the changes to the old nodelist may check the result of
         its editing.

         Since only the differences will be distributed, it is important
         to insure the accuracy of the newly created nodelist. This is the
         function of the CRC mentioned above. It is sufficient for a
         program designed to perform the above edits to pick the CRC value
         from the first line added to the output file, then compute the
         CRC of the rest of the output file. If the two CRCs do not agree,
         one of the input files has been corrupted. If they do agree, the
         probability is very high (but not 100%) that the output file is
         accurate.

         For actual distribution, NODEDIFF.nnn is packed into an archive
         file named NODEDIFF.?nn, where 'nn' are the last two digits of
         day-of-year, and '?' indicates the compression format used.


     NODELIST COMPILATION

         This section is included for tutorial reasons and is not intended
         as a definition of any specific method by which FidoNet MUST
         compile its weekly nodelist. It merely represents an attempt to
         document the method by which it currently does so. It is intended
         to be explanatory, and seeks to answer commonly asked questions,
         such as how the nodelist is compiled and where the information
         comes from, why the nodelists used in different FidoNet zones are
     FIDONEWS 14-20               Page 17                  19 May 1997


         not the same document, and why the difference file generated for
         use in one FidoNet zone cannot be applied to the nodelist
         generated for use in a different zone, even though the week
         numbers match.

         Nodelists are compiled via a distributed method, which follows
         the same structure as the FidoNet coordinator hierarchy. At the
         lowest level, network coordinators maintain a list of the nodes
         in their network and are responsible for the addition, removal
         and correction of individual node's listings in their "segment"
         (as portions of the full nodelist are called). In some larger
         networks, it is common for this job to be shared with hub
         coordinators appointed by the net coordinator, though the
         responsibility for those hub segments still remains with the
         network coordinator.

         At a nominated day during the week, before the regional level
         segment is submitted to the zone coordinator, individual net
         coordinators submit their segments to the regional coordinator
         who subsequently compiles these segments and transmits the merged
         copy to the zone coordinator. These are combined by the zone
         coordinator with the separate segments of other zones and
         compiled into that zone's version of the world nodelist. This
         world nodelist is then compared with the previous week's version,
         a difference file is generated and subsequently distributed
         throughout the zone.

         In some cases, in the interest of saving in transmission times
         and therefore costs, the compilation process itself may be better
         served by the submission of DIFFERENCE FILES rather than full
         net- or region-level segments. Each coordinator therefore retains
         a copy of the previously submitted segments and applies
         difference files to those to derive the new one. This process is
         exactly identical to the NODEDIFF/NODELIST scenario described
         earlier in this document, with the same first line and CRC
         validation method used to guard the integrity of the nodelist
         segments.

         For a number of reasons, it is important that publication of the
         nodelist be as timely as possible. These reasons include: the
         nodelist is a definitive list of valid FidoNet addresses that may
         receive mail, and must therefore be as correct and up-to-date as
         possible to save nodes the unnecessary expense of mail routed to
         possibly non-existing addresses; the nodelist contains the list
         of telephone numbers that may be called by any user of the
         FidoNet nodelist and should therefore be accurate so as not to
         unduly annoy owners of those phone numbers should a listed node
         go down and an unsuspecting telephone subscriber inherit the same
         telephone number.

         Given this constraint, the expense of international calls and the
         fact that FidoNet is a worldwide network that exists in many time
         zones, it may be unreasonable to expect the compilation of the
         nodelist to be delayed until each zone coordinator can transmit
         their most up-to-date zone segment to a central authority for
         compilation and subsequent redistribution in any week. For the
     FIDONEWS 14-20               Page 18                  19 May 1997


         sake of expedience, each zone instead maintains its own separate
         world nodelist which contains a compilation of the current zone's
         latest segments and including the most current copy to hand of
         all other FidoNet zone's segments. The zone level nodelist
         generated each week by each zone coordinator is then transmitted
         to all other zone coordinators for inclusion into their separate
         world nodelist as timing permits.

         In theory, then, the only difference between nodelists
         distributed in each zone in any week are accounted for by timing
         differences in the exchange of each zone's separate segment. In
         practice, other constraints may interfere with timeliness, such
         as the difficulty and expense of international telephonic
         communications. Also, another point of variance is introduced by
         the fact that each zone usually includes its own zone segment
         first into its world nodelist to assist - amongst other things -
         software that uses the nodelist for index generation. Some
         software in common use in FidoNet indexes the nodelist according
         to its sequential order (e.g. version 5 and 6 compiled nodelist
         formats), and including the current zone first before others will
         have a beneficial effect on software performance.

            http://www.scms.rgu.ac.uk/students/cs_yr94/lk/fido.html


       Introduction
       ============

     This document makes recommendations on the use of various fields in
     the distribution nodelist (St. Louis nodelist format", fts-0005).
     Naturally it is the choice of the *C's if they want to use them.
     Remember the fts-0005 requirements should till be adhered to.


       Field 3, Node Name
       ==================

     The node name field should be no more than 20 characters long. For
     comparison in nodelist.122'1997 the minimum entry was 1, maximum
     51! and the average was 14.

     For zone entries this field should contain a description of the zones
     area, (eg North America, Europe). For region entries it should contain
     the country/state, for host entries the local area name and for hub
     entries a description of the area the hub serves.


       Field 4, Location
       =================

     This field contains the location of the node. It should usually be
     expressed as the primary local location (town, suburb, city, etc.)
     plus an identifier of the regional geopolitical administrative
     district (state, province, department, county, etc.). Wherever
     possible, standard postal abbreviations for the major regional
     district should be used (IL, BC, NSW, UK, etc.).

     For zone and region entries this field should also have the julian
     day of segment creation appended to it (eg "Somearea_(122)") to
     aid checks on the validity of the nodelist.


       Field 5, Sysop Name
       ===================

     This field contains the name of the system operator. Entries such as
     "postmaster" and "uucp" should not be used. Aliases should not be
     permitted in this field (as they give Fidonet a 'less respectable'
     image).

       Introduction
       ============

     This document describes the standard form of addressing in Fidonet
     today along with the common method of addressing via internet
     gateways. In addition it proposes an extended addressing syntax,
     useful for routing purposes. This is a draft for comments and
     suggestions.


       Standard Fidonet Addressing
       ===========================

     Fidonet addressing uses the following format:

         ZZ:NN/FF.PP@DO

     where the fields refer to...

     ZZ - Zone Number:  The zone the node is part of.
                        Min: 1 Max: 32767
                        If 'ZZ:' is missing then assume 1 as the zone.

     NN - Net Number:   The network the node is a member of.
                        Min: 1 Max: 32767
                        Must be present.

     FF - Node Number:  The actual node number.
                        Min: -1 Max: 32767
                        Must be present.

     PP - Point Number: If the system is a point rather than a node then
                        this is their point number off the node.
                        Min: 0 Max: 32767
                        If '.PP' is missing then assume 0 (ie not a point)
                        as the point number.

     DO - Domain:       The name of the 'Fidonet Technology Network'.
                        Maximum length of 8 characters. The domain
                        should not include periods, thus 'fidonet.org'
                        is invalid (should be fidonet).
                        If '@DO' is missing then fidonet can be assumed.

     The following are all valid examples:
     FIDONEWS 14-20               Page 21                  19 May 1997


         1:234/5.6@fidonet  (a '5D' address)   => 1:234/5.6@fidonet
         2:34/6.78          (a '4D' address)   => 2:34/6.78@fidonet
         4:610/34           (a '3D' address)   => 4:610/34.0@fidonet
         123/45             (a '2D' address)   => 1:123/45.0@fidonet
         955:95/2@othernet  (another FTN)      => 955:95/2.0@othernet
         2:259/-1           (node application) => 2:259/-1.0@fidonet

     The limits on each various part of the address are a result of
     fts-0005 (zone, net, node, point), fsc-0045 (domain) and Policy 4
     (-1 node address for node application).


       Internet Gateway Addressing
       ===========================

     An internet user can send email/netmail to a fidonet user via one of
     the fidonet->internet gateway systems (it's out-with the scope of this
     document to describe the semantics of posting). The internet user
     would send an email to a Fidonet user by using an email address of the
     following syntax:

         user.name@pPP.fFF.nNN.zZZ.gateway.domain

     where the fields refer to...

     user.name - Name:         Name of the user the email is being sent
                               to, spaces replaced by periods.

     PP        - Point Number: As Fidonet address (FA)
                               If '.pPP' is missing 0 is assumed.

     FF        - Node Number:  As FA
                               Must be present.

     NN        - Net Number:   As FA
                               Must be present.

     ZZ        - Zone Number:  As FA
                               Must be present.

     gate.way  - Gateway:      Internet domain of the gateway, for
                               example 'fidonet.org'.
                               Must be present.

     The following are all valid examples (assuming 'fidonet.org' is an
     internet gateway):

         joe.bloggs@p6.f5.n234.z1.fidonet.org  => 1:234/5.6@fidonet
         harry.cat@p78.f6.n34.z2.fidonet.org   => 2:34/6.78@fidonet
         i.be.jolly@f34.n610.z4.fidonet.org    => 4:610/34.0@fidonet

     and if 'foo.bar.org.uk' is a gateway for 'othernet':

         louise.hat@f2.n95.z955.foo.bar.org.uk => 955:95/2.0@othernet

       Routing Address Syntax
       ======================

     The two previous address types (Fidonet and Internet->Fidonet gateway)
     are common practice, this however is a suggested standard of
     addressing for routing tables. The routing address has the following
     syntax:

         DD:ZZ:RR:NN:HH:FF:PP

     where the fields refer to:

     DD - Domain:        As FA
                         Must be present, even if blank (ie a leading ':')
                         to ensure we always have 6 ':'s in an address to
                         aid pattern matching.

     ZZ - Zone Number:   As FA
                         Must be present.

     RR - Region Number: The region (from fts-0005 nodelist) that the
                         following network is in.
                         Min: 1 Max: 32767
                         Must be present.

     NN - Net Number:    As FA
                         Must be present.

     HH - Hub:           The hub (from fts-0005 nodelist) that the node is
                         under, or 0 (host hub).
                         Min: 1 Max: 32767
                         Must be present.

     FF - Node Number:   As FA
                         Must be present.

     PP - Point Number:  As FA
                         Must be present.

     ':' has been chosen as the separator as it is not a POSIX regular
     expression character or globing character (where as '.' is) and thus
     always easy use of wildcards on the address. The following points
     should be noted:

         1. All addresses have 6 ':'s
         2. The domain is at the front, the address gets more specific to
            the right
         3. Nodes have 0 as their point number
         4. A zone net has identical zone, region and net fields
         5. A region net has identical region and net fields

     Example fidonet addresses converted to routing addresses:

         fidonet:2:25:259:0:7:0 => 2:259/7.0@fidonet, region 25, hub 0
         fidonet:1:1:1:0:23:0   => 1:1/23.0@fidonet, zone 1 net
         :955:9551:95:300:45:0  => 955:95/45.0, region 9551, hub 300
     FIDONEWS 14-20               Page 23                  19 May 1997


         fidonet:2:25:25:0:0:0  => 2:25/0.0@fidonet, R25C
         cnet:12:34:341:100:1:7 => 12:341/1.7@cnet, region 34, hub 100
         :2:25:259:300:300:0    => 2:259/300.0, region 25, hub 300

     Example POSIX regular expression patterns on routing addresses:

         [a-z]*:[0-9]+:[0-9]+:[0-9]+:[0-9]+:[0-9]+:[0-9]+ (any address)
         [a-z]*(:[0-9]+)+                                 (any address)
         fidonet:2:25:[0-9]+:[0-9]+:[0-9]+:[0-9]+      (region 25 node)
         fidonet:2:25(:[0-9]+)+                        (region 25 node)
         fidonet:1:12:125(:[0-9]+)+               (all net 1:125 nodes)
         fidonet:1:12:125:200(:[0-9]+)+   (all hub 1:125/200 downlinks)
         fidonet:1:12:125:200:2:[0-9]+             (all 1:125/2 points)
         fidonet:1:12:125:[0-9]+:(25|34|56):0
                          (nodes 1:125/25.0, 1:125/34.0 and 1:125/56.0)

     Example 'DOS style' patterns on routing addresses:

         *:*:*:*:*:*:*                                    (any address)
         fidonet:2:25:*:*:*:*                          (region 25 node)
         fidonet:1:12:125:*:*:*                   (all net 1:125 nodes)
         fidonet:1:12:125:200:*:*         (all hub 1:125/200 downlinks)
         fidonet:1:12:125:200:2:*                  (all 1:125/2 points)
         fidonet:1:12:125:*:3*:0  (any net 1:125 nodes starting with 3)
         fidonet:1:12:125:*:3?:0           (net 1:125 nodes 30 thru 39)

     The standard doesn't define which standard of pattern matching to use,
     only the format of the addresses. These routing addresses would
     be used in routing tables and configurations.
