     =================================================================

     Zone 3 has a new Zone Coordinator in the person of Alwyn Smith. This
     was announced in Zone 3 on 1 Aug 97 according to the published account
     that appears later in this Issue.

     Congratulations, Alwyn. [Why is that name familiar?]

     Zone 2 has the same Zone Coordinator it has had since its last
     election (Ward Dossche).

     Why mention these under the Table of Contents entry: "What's wrong
     with this picture?"

     [Rant Mode on.]

     Because in this Zone [Zone 1], Nodelist.220 contains the Zone 2
     Coordinator entry for three weeks ago and the Zone 3 Coordinator
     entry dated by David Nugent's resignation from the post and from
     FidoNet. There is no indication how old the Zones 4, 5, or 6 are from
     a casual viewing.

     The Nodelist is FidoNet. The Nodelist is SUPPOSED to be current so
     Sysops can follow FidoNet Policy by using the most current Nodelist
     available. This is impossible when the compilation does not contain
     accurate and timely updates.

     FidoNet only has 6 Zones. We have all sorts of electronic routes for
     mail and files to get dispersed from Zone to Zone to Zone, etc. That
     being said, is there any good reason why EVERY Zone doesn't have the
     exact, same, dated segment for EACH Zone in each compilation in each
     Zone? Zone 1 certainly doesn't. That's obvious from Zone 1. What is
     the condition of the compilations in the other 5 Zones?

     Zone 2 - do you have the new ZC3 listed in your compilation? Zone 3 -
     do you have the 220 notation in your Zone 2 listing there? Zone 4 - do
     you even exist? We never hear from you. Likewise for Zone 5 and Zone
     6 - what's your story? Is FidoNet REALLY an international
     organization?  It doesn't seem like it most of the time.

     Zone Coordinators from ALL SIX Zones are cordially invited to respond
     to FidoNews and explain why the entire globe is not synchronized in
     Nodelist production when anyone can be linked to another in a matter
     of seconds at least once a week! Your responses will be published for
     all to consider.

     [Rant mode off.]

     Otherwise, it's a short Issue with a couple reports and some feedback
     to last week's items.

     C.B.

     Hi Christopher,

     I saw your question about the Z3C election in the snooze.  The
     following messages contains some interesting (to us) stats.

     Zone Co-ordinator Election
     ==========================

     Following ratification by the RC's, here are the results:

     Alwyn Smith     73 (54.1%)
     Glen Harvy      22 (16.3%)
     Denise Webber   17 (12.6%)
     Carla Perry      7 (5.2%)

     David Hales      6 (4.4%)
     Kym Gotch        4 (3.0%)

     Alwyn Smith is therefore the new Z3C.

     Thank you to everyone for their patience with the delay in
     announcing the results and for participating.

     Subj: Reply regarding Zone 6 name server request in FidoNews 1431

     With respect to Dr Ivan Shim, who signs himself the Zone 6 name server
     manager in his Fidonews 1431 article, it is important that Internet
     users understand that it is often desirable for name servers to be
     located far away from the domains which they serve.

     Anyone who sends mail into a domain will have to query one of the name
     servers for that domain.  If someone in the U.S. wants to send a piece
     of mail to someone in Taiwan, for example, it is inevitable that the
     mail itself will have to cross a transoceanic link.  However, there is
     no reason that U.S. mail senders should be querying name servers in
     Taiwan about Taiwan addresses.  It is far more efficient for a name
     server to be set up in the U.S. which can be queried entirely within
     the U.S. for information about Taiwan addresses, so that only the
     actual mail and not the name service queries will have to be passed
     FIDONEWS 14-32               Page 5                   11 Aug 1997


     over the expensive transoceanic bandwidth.

     As a result, efficiency is promoted on the Internet when name servers
     for domains are established close to those who send mail into those
     domains, not necessarily close to the domains themselves.

                              FTSC STANDING MEMBERS
                             ======================

     by Adrian Walker, 1:153/752
     04 August 1997

     Interim FTSC Web Site:  http://www.portal.ca/~awalker/ftsc.htm

     INTRODUCTION
     ============

     As detailed in FIDO1412.NWS, discussion has been underway since 01
     December 1996 in the FTSC_PUBLIC echo to define the mission and
     operating procedures for a revitalized Fidonet Technical Standards
     Committee (FTSC).

     From 24 March until 01 August 1997, nominations have been accepted
     following the process detailed in the two documents, FTA-1000 (FTSC
     Charter) and FTA-1001 (FTSC Operations) which were hatched into the
     FTSC file echo in the early spring.

     The next step is the voting process to appoint FTSC Standing Members,
     after which an Administrator will be selected, and working groups
     established.

     VOTE REQUIREMENTS
     =================

     FTA-1001, provides for the following voting process for FTSC Standing
     Members:

     === Cut ===
          Standing members are appointed on the basis of a vote by all RCs
          and RECs who are nodelisted as holding those positions at the
          time the nominations are published.  A successful candidate must
          receive approval by a majority of votes.

          Publication of the nomination and the voting procedure, and
          posting of RC and REC votes, shall take place openly in the
          FTSC_PUBLIC echo, and voting shall close three weeks after
          publication of the vote.
     === Cut ===

     VOTING PROCEDURE
     ================

     NODELIST.220, dated 08 August 1997, will be used for RC and REC
     identification.

     FIDONEWS 14-32               Page 7                   11 Aug 1997


     All RCs and RECs clearly identified as such in that nodelist are
     eligible to vote.

     Voting commences at 0000 UTC on Saturday 16 August 1997 and closes at
     2359 UTC on Friday 05 September 1997.

     Each RC and REC ballot is to be sent either via:

          *  netmail to Adrian Walker at 1:153/752, or
          *  Internet email to awalker@portal.ca

     Receipt of votes will be acknowledged by return netmail or email.

     Ballots should include a password.  The ballot format is given below.

     Votes shall be "Yes" or "No" for each of the 26 candidates.  An
     abstention for any candidate is permitted.

     APPOINTMENT
     ===========

     A majority of "Yes" over "No" for a candidate is required for that
     person to be appointed as a Standing Member.  Abstentions are not
     counted.

     No votes or summaries of votes shall be posted prior to the conclusion
     of voting.  Within 3 days after the conclusion of voting, the RC and
     REC votes shall be posted in the FTSC_PUBLIC echo.  For each vote
     cast, only the password and the result for each vote will be posted.
     The identity of the voter shall not be shown.

     To provide the required split between 2 and 3 year terms, Standing
     Members will be ranked by the number of "Yes" votes received.  The top
     half of this ranking will be appointed for 3 years, and the remaining
     candidates for 2 years.

     To think that Zone 2 has the most nodes in Fidonet and I still don't
     get any news. About that laptop I have received help on that and would
     like to thank whoever sent it (the to field was left blank).

     Remember log on to the Fidonet in Europe web site at
