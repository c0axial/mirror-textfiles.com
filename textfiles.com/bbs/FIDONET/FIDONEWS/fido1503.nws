                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================

     The ZEC1 Election got an extension due to the extensive mail outages
     produced by recent weather in the Great White North and other points
     south and east. Though no official notice was received here for
     inclusion, I've snatched a few tidbits from here and there and stuck
     them here without consultation. [grin]

     I also put some SPAM here which could be found in most of the Backbone
     Echos I carry here and probably everywhere else. When will folks learn
     to use the resources available? FidoNews - it's not just for inane
     ASCII art. [snicker]

     The death of Cliff Harrold in Zone 2 is further subject of tribute in
     today's edition. Treasure your cyberfriends while they're here is the
     message. We ARE a community!

     There is also an update to the ARGUS info posted in 1501 and some info
     from the 'new' FTSC.

     Subj: IP mailer

     Hello, Christopher!

     In the first FidoNews issue of 1998 (BTW, Happy New Year :) one guy
     mentioned ARGUS, our russian mailer which can make FTN connections via
     IP. But he probably doesn't know that Argus uses protocol named
     'BINKP' which was implemented first in BinkD mailer. BinkD was
     developed also in Russia, in Magadan. (it's cold there :) BinkD can
     carry out FTN sessions only via IP and is available for Win95, WinNT,
     OS/2 and Unix. Moreover, it is available in sources, one can compile
     it for anything he wants.

     Check http://www.magadan.su/~maloff/binkd

     I just can add that BinkD carries 99% of our Russian bone. ;)

     Have a good day, Oleg {- [Team OS/2].

     Subj: Questionnaires

     Hi all.

     I kept a rough tally of candidate questionnaires (not individual
     questions).  I saw 9 posted.  They were from:  Gronke, Hallford,
     Simmons, Mitchell, Roberts, Whitaker, Santos, Souvestre and Kershew.

     Of these 9, I saw this many answered by each of the candidates:

       Jim Balcom             8
       David Calafrancesco    9
       Wayne DeLisle Sr       4  <==  Storm?
       John Glinski           9
       Bob Kohl               2  <==
       Mike Luther            9
       Jeff Smith             6

     Not bad, actually.  All answered 6 or more except for two candidates.
     Wayne's link was down part of the time due to the storm so perhaps he
     is still catching up.  Bob Kohl, however, answered only 2.

     Thanks to those of you who took the time to respond.

     Subj: Announcement of FTSC decisions

     Hello All.

     Based on public input and consensus in FTSC_PUBLIC and votes among
     members in FTSC, the FTSC have decided the following:

     1. The numbering scheme for FTS documents will be grouped as in my
        proposal a while ago, i.e. FTS-XYYY.

     2. Standards that are not directly Fidonet Standards (such as msgbase
        formats), will be collected and maintained by the FTSC, but with a
        different prefix.  This prefix is FRS (Fidonet Related Standard).

     3. The prefix for both FTS and FRS proposals will be FSP (Fidonet
        Standard Proposal), and proposals that don't get accepted will both
        get the prefix FRL (Fidonet Reference Library).

     4. The old FSC documents keep their FSC prefix and will NOT be renamed
        with the FRL prefix.

     5. The "Key words to indicate requirement levels" document has been
        adopted as FTA-1006. The issue of whether it applies to itself has
        been clarified in the revision that will be posted later.

     6. The Public Domain requirement of FTA-1001 has been replaced with
        the "Intellectual Property Rights" document, which has been adopted
        as FTA-1007.  This means that the FTSC can now accept both Public
        Domain and copyrighted documents. For copyrighted documents, the
        copyright holder (or a representative) must give the FTSC a license
        to use, distribute and modify it.  See the document for details.
        This is basically the same license as that used by the IESG
        (Internet Engineering Steering Group, the internet counterpart to
        the FTSC) to accept documents for RFC's and STD's (RFC2026).

      NET254, ENET.SYSOP and REGION25 regarding the death of Cliff Harrold
      (former RC 2:25). Could you please put them in the first available

     Folks,

     I'm afraid I am the bearer of some deeply saddening news :-(

     I have just learned that Cliff Harrold passed away suddenly today.

     Details are sketchy at the moment, but I am in touch with his family,
     and will pass on any further information if they ask me to.

     At this moment in time Cliff's system is still up, and one of his sons
     is familiar with the running of it - however, it would obviously be
     insensitive of us to presume that the system will be left on for any
     great length of time, so, as a temporary measure, Peter Burnett and I
     are offering our systems as standby feeds in order to take the weight
     off 2:442/403 as quickly as is practical. Peter and I carry the full
     backbone, and have sufficient disk space etc to cope with any
     FIDONEWS 15-03               Page 7                   19 Jan 1998


     additional feeds that may be requested, and I'm sure there will be
     others who will step in and make a similar offer.

     Hi All!

             I have just learned that the REC Cliff Harrold has Passed away
     :-(

     I have been feeding from Cliff's MNL for nearly 5 years now and I
     considered him to be a very good friend. We often spoke for ages on
     the phone. I am deeply shocked that this has happened.  I was talking
     to him only last night on the phone and everything seemed to be ok.

     He will be deeply missed by many.


     Cya l8tr

     Dear Friends & Colleagues!

     It is with great sadness, and disbelief, that I have to tell you all
     that Cliff Harrold, R25EC.  Has passed away from our circle!  8-(
     FIDONEWS 15-03               Page 8                   19 Jan 1998


     I only started to work with Cliff a couple of years ago. Our first
     contacts were not always easy. I felt he needed to be more assertive ,
     and he rose to the challenge.

     My appreciation of him grew, to a good working relationship, and, over
     many a silly dispute, he proved an excellent advisor, and anchor man.

     He was instrumental in solving my dispute with Z2EC last year, and a
     cornerstone in the foundation of Net 258.

     He also worked selflessly, and enthusiastically to forward the
     echomail distribution in the UK. His enthusiasm, and down to earth
     approach, coupled with his willingness to go that 'extra mile' to
     achieve an acceptable result to all sides will be sorely missed. His
     devotion to his job was unquestionable, even in the face of a
     'dwindling' fidonet. Cliff was always there in the background, making
     sure things 'worked' on the echomail front.

     This is the fourth sad passing of a fellow sysop I have had to
     witness, and it only goes to amplify the mortality of us all.

     At this time, let us not argue about silly things, over moderator
     elections etc, etc. Let us all reflect on Cliff's success in fidonet!.
     All that he stood for, and all that was/is good in this hobby we
     share. Let us all work selflessly to put our hobby back where it
     belongs in the future, not as some second class refuge to Internet.
     That's what Cliff would have asked of us, were he here to say it
     himself.

     Lastly, when you read this message - spare a minute of silence in
     respect for him! Then think where are you coming from, and going to. I
     hope Cliff's last Journey from this world, will be one of
     enlightenment, and fulfillment!

     Success is a Journey!

     it is not a quantity, you cannot measure it!

     In Fidonet, Cliff achieved reasonable success!. I only hope his
     successor can aspire to what he has put in place.

     Thank you for taking the time to read this.

     Keith Wassell, R25C, and proud to have had the honour of working with
     him.

     Folks,

     Cliff Harrold, our friend and colleague, will be laid to rest this
     coming Friday, 16th January.

     The party will leave the Harrold's home a little before 1pm, to make
     the 1 hour journey to the crematorium at Narberth, Carmarthenshire.

     Mrs. Harrold has spoken to me regarding the suggestion that we club
     together to make a collection for some flowers for Cliff's funeral.
     She would prefer that we make a donation to a charity, and will let me
     know over the next few days which one she would like to nominate.

     I suspect that we will each be able to make a donation direct to the
     charity, if we so wish, but Billy Connelly (2:258/1) has very kindly
     offered to act as a collection point, for those who wish to contribute
     that way. I will leave it up to Billy to post any details, and will
     let you know the name of the nominated charity in due course.

      Regards,

       Dave

     ======================================================================

     Dear Fidonet Friends,
                         it is with a heavy heart, and a great deal of
     sadness that I find myself writing this message, it is something that
     I thought I would never have to do.

     After being informed of the passing away this week of the REC, Cliff
     Harrold, I can say that I am still in a state of shock, and I am
     mourning the loss of a good friend.

     I first got to know Cliff when he started running his Midnight line,
     and over the years since then we became good friends.

     I was very suspicious of his motives for becoming REC, and I can quite
     safely say that he had proved me totally wrong, and did the job with a
     vigor and dedication to an amateur hobby, that I have only ever seen a
     few other people aspire to.

     Cliff impressed me very much with his dedication, and after I became
     Z2EC I found out just how hard he did work on behalf of fidonet.
     Almost daily we would be on the phone to each other quietly behind the
     scenes, sorting out feeds, broken links, and general EC problems, in
     fact cliffs phone number has appeared on my bills more times than any
     one else's, it wasn't because he wanted or needed help either, its
     because he was dedicated, and a total perfectionist, if there was the
     slightest problem, he would be there, quietly, behind the scenes
     trying to sort it out for the good of the network.

     What many of you will not have seen is that tireless dedication,
     sometimes into the wee small hours, that lead to the prevention of
     problems that many of you would not have seen, he corrected them,
     sorted them out, and dealt with them whilst they where minor niggles,
     and long before they became major issues.

     Over the last two years, I have also become involved with Cliff, in a
     few projects that were not Fidonet related, and again he impressed me
     with the same dedication and helpfulness that he showed me in fidonet.

     I can safely say that Cliff was the BEST, MOST DEDICATED and Caring
     REC that it has been my pleasure to work with, and having met him
     several times I can also safely say that he was a friend, and one of
     this worlds truly "Good guys".

     I shall miss his daily phone banter, I shall miss his friendship, and
     Fidonet has lost one of the most dedicated people I have known.

     Cliff, if somehow you could read this, then I know what you did for
     fidonet, and I appreciate your efforts more than you will ever know,
     if there is a heaven, I know that it will benefit from your
     dedication.  Goodbye matey, you will be surely missed.

     ZCC-PUBLIC .. a peek in the ZC-kitchen
     By Ward Dossche, 2:292/854
        ZC/2

     As of today (Jan. 16, 1998) I have started to crosspost all my
     messages from the ZCC-conference to a new conference entitled:

            ZCC-PUBLIC

     This conference will be offered free to all and available for
     worldwide distribution.

     Messages not originating at my keyboard are, of course, not
     crossposted.

     All ZC's are invited to connect to it and post their own messages in
     it.

     Upon request however and for their comfort I can also install a robot
     to automagically take care of it.

     The idea for a parallel-conference, instead of allowing link-ins to
     ZCC who would be abused anyway, is Alwyn's. That way the ZC's wouldn't
     be bothered by possible background-noise.
