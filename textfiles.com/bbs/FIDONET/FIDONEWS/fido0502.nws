                 How FidoNews works and a brief summary on
                    how to submit articles to FidoNews


          After taking  a look at my mailer's logs for this past week,
     I thought I'd go over how things work here at 1/1. Hopefully this
     will avoid some of the confusion I've seen over the past week.

          One of  the first things I should go over is how FidoNews is
     put together. Every week  I run  a program  (MakeNews) that takes
     your  submissions  and  creates  a finished FidoNews. It's a nice
     automated program that is  very  flexible.  If  you  submit three
     articles named  JIM1.ART, JIM2.ART,  and JIM3.ART; MakeNews would
     put JIM1.ART in the first week, JIM2.ART in  the second  week and
     so on.  This allows  you to write a entire series of articles and
     submit it at once, while only "printing" one article each week.

          MakeNews is run every Monday morning just after midnight, so
     don't try file requesting FidoNews on Sunday unless you want last
     weeks issue. During the two hours after putting  it together, 1/1
     is busy trying to send FidoNews out to the Regional Coordinators.
     Phil Ardussi  at 157/1  is also  helping send  FidoNews out, this
     should  let  my  machine  be  accessible  a  little more quickly.
     Because of this, I'd  appreciate  it  if  no  one  tried  to file
     request  FidoNews  during  this  time. I'd suggest any time after
     National Mail Hour for convenience. While I understand  that many
     of  you  want  to  get  the  latest  edition hot off the presses,
     there's an awful lot  of you  and we're  trying to  reach as many
     people as quickly as possible.

          1/1  itself  is  running  SEAdog  4.1 and TBBS 2.0S. You can
     currently file request any issue of FidoNews from  Volume 4 Issue
     9 up to the present. I've got a full set of FidoNews on their way
     for those who are interested  and  will  let  everyone  know when
     they've arrived.  If you're only interested in the latest edition
     of FidoNews, I've set up the  "magic filename"  of 'FIDONEWS' for
     your ease. This means if you file request 'FIDONEWS' with no file
     extension or volume number, you're assured of getting  the latest
     edition. Keep  in mind  that I'm  running SEAdog and can't handle
     the Opus  style file  requests, you'll  have to  be using SEAdog,
     Dutchie or  BinkleyTerm if you want to file request FidoNews from
     me. It is available in a bulletin on my bulletin board as soon as
     it's generated  and can  usually be  found for normal downloading
     sometime Monday evening.

          There also seems to be some  confusion on  how to  submit an
     article for FidoNews. This is going to be real easy. The articles
     should be in straight ASCII, no  high-bit flags  or other unusual
     characters (including the TAB character). I know this is a little
     hard for some who aren't familiar with how  to generate  an ASCII
     file from  their word  processor, but it's the only standard that
     FidoNews 5-02                Page 2                   11 Jan 1988


     everyone can support. All lines should start at  the first column
     as a  general rule.  If you're trying to show a chart or indent a
     paragraph, use beginning spaces.  Just don't  try and  center the
     text on  the page,  MakeNews will  indent every  article the same
     amount. This makes for  a consistent  layout (usually).  The only
     other  constraint  is  that  no  line  should  be  longer than 65
     characters. The file name should have an extension of .ART for an
     article, .COL  for a column, and .NOT for a notice. If you adhere
     to these rules, your article should  be published  in one  to two
     weeks from  the time I receive it. If I'm paying strict attention
     to what's coming in, I try  to send  you a  short message telling
     you that your file did indeed arrive here and all is well.

          If  you  want  you  article  to  be  listed  in the table of
     contents, your  first line  should read  "* (however  you want it
     listed)." The  asterisk tells  MakeNews to generate a listing for
     the article in the table  of  contents  and  this  line  does not
     appear in  the "published"  article. After  the table of contents
     line, if any, it is common  practice to  include a  title of some
     sort  along  with  your  name  and  net/node number. I personally
     prefer this to be centered, but it's your article do as you wish.

          That's about all I'm going to go over this week. I'd like to
     thank all  of you who have wished me good luck as the new editor.
     I wish I could list all of you,  but unfortunately  it would take
     too many  pages. If you have any questions on any of this, please
     feel free to drop me a line. Once again I'm going to list a whole
     bunch of  ways you  can reach  me, and I want to encourage all of
     you to contact me whichever way is easiest for you.

     From: THOM HENDERSON
     To: ALL
     Subj: ADIOS

          The old  year is  gone, the new year is just beginning.  And
     here I sit, up  way too  late (and  with perhaps  a tad  too much
     bourbon) sitting  at my  keyboard.   It seems a propitious moment
     for me to say farewell.

          There are many of you out there who  have become  my friends
     in these  past few years.  You I will miss.  It is for you that I
     write this.

          Many of you out there dislike me, for reasons both  real and
     imagined.   Some of  you have disliked me before you even knew me
     as an individual, but only knew SEA as the company that published
     ARC.   Others have disliked me only since you've heard me express
     myself, and found that you sometimes  disagreed with  me. This is
     not adressed  to you,  for nothing that I might say will dissuade
     you from your hard-fought beliefs.

          But many of you  I count  as friends,  and to  you I  owe an
     explanation.

          Why am  I leaving  FidoNet?  I would think that obvious, but
     perhaps  you  do  not.    I   have  seen   a  growing   cloud  of
     misinterpretation  and   misrepresentation.    Perhaps  you  have
     disagreed with me about particular  goals  or  directions,  but I
     have always  felt that  I was  working towards  the betterment of
     amateur electronic mail as  a viable  hobby.   Maybe I  have been
     wrong  --  certainly  I  have  been  wrong my share of times, and
     perhaps more -- but I have never felt that I was evil.   Nor have
     I felt  that others  who disagreed  with me  were evil.   For two
     people can  disagree  (perhaps  even  vehemently)  without either
     being evil.

          But I  have fought  for my  vision of what is right for over
     two years, and I grow  weary.    I  am  weary  of  the  scorn and
     ridicule I  have harvested.  I am tired of the shaded truths, the
     half truths, the misdirection, and the outright lies  that abound
     these days.   You've all heard the lies, and a gratifyingly large
     number of you have recognized them  for what  they are. Certainly
     it is  not surprising  that I  am tired of continually refighting
     that battle.

          Do you mind if I tell you  a  little  story?    I  hope not.
     About three and a half years ago my partner and I were working on
     a project  we called  (at that  time) ComLink.   The  idea was to
     automate  file  transfers  between  PC's.   At about that time we
     stumbled across a fledging  FidoNet, numbering  about 50  nodes.
     The way Fido did it seemed as good a way as any (and incidentally
     gave us a good test target), so we adopted it.  We set up  a test
     network of  our two  machines plus another two machines at client
     sites and  named them  "SEAdog One",  "SEAdog Two",  and so forth
     (being the  SEA "dogs",  as it were).  My own machine, as head of
     the private network, was named "SEAdog Leader" (from watching too
     many episodes  of "Black  Sheep"), and that was the machine I did
     the initial testing and  development of  ComLink on.   But before
     long  we  found  ourselves  referring  to  "my  SEAdog" and "your
     SEAdog", and thus the name "SEAdog"  as the  name of  the package
     was born.   (There  is still no part of the SEAdog system that is
     actually named "SEAdog".)   In truth,  the SEND  and GET commands
     are about what we originally had in mind.

          Along  the  way  we  found  ourselves  getting more and more
     involved with FidoNet, and at some point we collaborated with Tom
     Jennings to  get the  FTSC started,  because we all realized that
     there was a potential in  what  we  were  doing  that transcended
     anything any  of us  had originally  supposed.   In particular, I
     think that TJ and I both  envisioned some  sort of  public domain
     email  standard  for  amateur  systems  running  on  any  sort of
     hardware, so we were both willing  to limit  what we  would do in
     order to further that standard.

          I say "limit" because the essence of establishing a standard
     lies in limiting it.  In the act  of saying  to any  new software
     developer, "This  which we have documented WILL work", one limits
     how one may change that in the future.

          I saw that as a viable tradeoff.  I still do.

          But all of this is hopefully a side  point.   At least, only
     future  events  will  show  if  this  is  a side point or not.  I
     earnestly hope that it will remain  aside point  forever.   I see
     faint marks  of handwriting  on the  wall that a technical battle
     over standards is forthcoming  for FidoNet  (which I  do not wish
     to participate in), but I most sincerely hope that I am wrong.

          But regardless,  I see  factionalism growing  in FidoNet.  I
     see a dichotomy between FidoNet and IFNA that I don't think ought
     to exist.   I  feel that  we once  had a  sense of camraderie and
     mutual trust that no longer  seems  to  exist.    Those  who read
     Policy3  with  a  discerning  eye  will  see  that  it implicitly
     assumes a body of sysops working together for a common  goal, and
     TRYING to work together.  I'm not sure that we have that anymore.

          Inevitable disclaimer for the inevitable few who will choose
     to misinterprete:   I  didn't say it isn't there.  I said I'm not
     sure it's there.

          But this is addressed to you, my friends  out there.   So to
     FidoNews 5-02                Page 5                   11 Jan 1988


     you I  will address  a few  answers to the flames, innuendos, and
     lies you are sure to hear once I am gone.

          Am I choosing between FidoNet and AlterNet?   No, I  am not.
     To quote  from a better man than I (I've often copied my betters,
     and I've never had  a problem  with attributing  my sources), Ben
     Baker said  that he  resigned for "reasons of health, sanity, and
     marriage".  The same applies to me.   I would  be leaving FidoNet
     in any  case.   My resignation  as elected Region 13 board member
     paved the  way, and  got the  same response  (domestically) as my
     resignation  as  Region  13  coordinator  and FidoNews publisher.
     (For those of an historical bent,  I'm the  last of  the original
     ten  Regional  Coordinators  to  resign.)    Do  I  leave with no
     regrets?  Of course not.  Whether I liked it  or not  (and by and
     large,  I  did)  I  was  the  FidoNews publisher for almost three
     years, longer than I've  held any  other offiicial  or unofficial
     post in FidoNet.  Thus I break a Chinese committment akin to when
     I started my school's first newspaper  back when  I was  in sixth
     grade  (this  meaning  nothing  to  you, I am sure, but having no
     small significance to me, this New Year's day).

          So no, I am not choosing between FidoNet and AlterNet.  I am
     choosing between AlterNet and pulling the plug.  As Ryugen Fisher
     so aptly put it, "AlterNet is  a  network  of  burnouts."  I find
     myself addicted  to this  vice of electronic mail, so I will give
     AlterNet a try.  The alternative  to me  is going  "cold turkey",
     as it  were, for I am surely leaving FidoNet.  If AlterNet fails,
     then I will be out of it altogether.

          Will AlterNet be "Henderson's network"?  Or, as  someone put
     it, am  I jumping  to be a big frog in a small pond?  Apt wording
     that, because Ryugen (the Old Frog) is the one who talked me into
     joing AlterNet.  Granted that AlterNet draws something (not much,
     but  something)  from  the  Alliance  Bylaws  that  I  wrote  for
     FidoNews some  time ago,  but aside from the name of the Alliance
     and a few titles, it bears  little  resemblance.    Pull  out the
     issue with  the Alliance  bylaws, compare  them with the Chivalry
     docs (both  are in  the published  FidoNews index),  and know the
     liars for what they are.

          Far from  being "my"  network, AlterNet  will not have me in
     any important position.  I will be a  "grunt sysop"  in AlterNet.
     The highest  position is  the Archduke,  who will be Phil Becker.
     The equivalent of RC of my region is the Duke of Middle Atlantis,
     who will be Michael Connick.  The equivalent of NC for my network
     is the Count of Metro on  Hudson, who  will be  William Bertholf.
     The equivalent of our local hub will be the Baron of North Jersey
     -- a position that was offered to me, but I refused (I don't know
     who will take it).

          I will  have no  position in AlterNet other than a plain ol'
     sysop.  So once again, you now know the liars for what  they are.
     Is the  Alliance a "for-profit" corporation?  Yes, but anyone who
     trys to tell you that this is a big deal either doesn't know what
     he's talking  about, or  he's trying to sell you a bill of goods.
     One of the painful  lessons we've  learned from  IFNA is  that it
     FidoNews 5-02                Page 6                   11 Jan 1988


     isn't always  a good  idea to  shoot for  tax exempt status.  For
     one, to  be tax  exempt one  must follow  all sorts  of rules and
     stipulations that  one might  not wish to follow.  For another, a
     tax-exempt MUST by law act primarily for the good of  the public.
     A corporation  that acts  primarily for  the good  of its members
     CANNOT be tax exempt.    The  Alliance  is  intended  to  do good
     primarily  for  sysops,  and  hence  CANNOT be tax exempt!  If we
     tried to make it so, then anyone involved could be in for serious
     felony  charges  a  few  years  down the road (something for IFNA
     board members to keep in mind!)

          Are  AlterNet  sysops  going   to  steal   FidoNet  echomail
     conferences?    Well,  it  kind  of  depends on what one means by
     "steal".  I've no doubt that at the beginning a certain amount of
     leakage  will  occur,  even  though  I myself see no point to it.
     FidoNet conferences are one of the main things that have  made me
     sick and  tired of FidoNet, so I myself can see no reason to port
     them over.  But no doubt the faint of heart will, at least in the
     early stages.   I  expect that AlterNet will quickly grow its own
     conferences of  equal  or  greater  merit  and  have  no  need of
     FidoNet conferences.

          Gee (as in golly), the Alliance sounds awfully elitist.  Why
     is that? Well, it's really very simple.  The Alliance IS elitist.
     We're not  saying that we are de-facto better than everyone else.
     We're saying that we're  going to  try darned  hard to  BE better
     than we  once were.   I  know that for myself at least that isn't
     going to be easy, but I sure intend to try!

          Will it cost money to be in AlterNet?   Yes,  as I  read it.
     The Council of Dukes sets the tithe, and all Knights are expected
     to stay current on all tithes.  Also, a local  Count might  lay a
     local tax  to pay  for outbound  mail service.   Meanwhile, it is
     mandated that the tithe pays for  a  legal  defense  fund.   BUT!
     Don't  ANYBODY  bother  to  tell  me  or  ANYONE  ELSE  that they
     disagree!  NOBODY has to join!  If you disagree,  then stay right
     where you are!

          How  does  AlterNet  affect  me?    If  you  do not join the
     Alliance, then I don't see  how  it  affects  you  at  all.   The
     Alliance is of no concern at all to those who do not join.

          Why should I join the Alliance?  If you want or need someone
     to tell you, then you should not join.  AlterNet and the Alliance
     most definetely  are NOT for everyone.  If you are burned out and
     thinking of pulling the plug, then you won't be asking  -- you'll
     be  joining.    As  for  everyone  else, ignore it. Remember what
     Ryugen so eloquently said, "AlterNet is  a network  of burnouts."
     Anyone who  tries to  "sell" you  on joining  the Alliance should
     probably rethink his own motives.

          Are you concerned about  keeping your  existing contacts and
     your existing  echomail links?   If so, then stay right where you
     are.  Neither faint heart nor false heart ere won  a fair maiden.
     (If you don't get the reference, I apologize.  Darned few got the
     "King Log/King Stork" reference either.)

          Does  this  mean  no  more  support   for  SEAdog?     Crass
     commercialisim raises  its head  once again.   You still have our
     mailing address, our customer support BBS (201-473-1991, a number
     that  has  never  been  in  the  nodelist),  and our voice number
     printed on your SEAdog  manual cover.   The  SEAdog conference in
     FidoNet (assuming  it continues) might not be attended by us, but
     it will at least exist as much as  it was  originally intended to
     exist. That  is, it  was established  to provide tech support for
     SEAdog  without  our  input   in  return   for  IFNA   getting  a
     substantial  discount  for  SEAdog  for  IFNA  members.  In other
     words, the SEAdog conference was never  supposed to  be moderated
     by us. Does this constitute abandonment?  I don't think so.  Near
     as I can tell, we continue  to provide  better support  than most
     software publishers.

          Ah, well, no way can I anticipate all that you'll hear about
     us in the coming weeks.  Suffice to  say that  a great  deal will
     be, shall  we say, somewhat less than wholly accurate.  Of that I
     am sure.   But  you have  our phone  number (it's  printed on the
     SEAdog  manual  cover,  and  widely  distributed  otherwise),  so
     please feel free to call us anytime you are in doubt.   (Oh, boy!
     Can I  see ways  that THAT  can be  misinterpreted! [at least, by
     those who wish to do so])  There's no  need to  take the  word of
     those  who  have  shown  themselves  to  be  somewhat  less  than
     reliable, as they say.  Just call us up and ask!

          It's even later now than I ever would  have imagined  that I
     might stay  up typing this, else I'd never have started.  Near as
     I can figure, I  have  about  ten  hours  before  our  mail relay
     converts to the AlterNet node list. Hopefully this will reach you
     before then.  Much to my chagrin (unless a VERY  late change came
     in)  I  won't  be  in  the  first  AlterNet  list  after all, but
     hopefully it won't take long.  To those of you, my friends that I
     leave behind,  I'll not  forget you.  You're all that's made this
     worthwhile.  And it HAS been worthwhile, by and large.  As I said
     in my final FidoNet editorial, by and large it's been fun.

          How  do   I  end  a  three  and  a  half  year  relationship
     gracefully?  I don't know.   If you've  stuck with  me this long,
     through  all  these  words  I've  entered,  you must be one of my
     friends.   So maybe  I can  say this  now.   (Or at  the least, I
     won't have  to hear any ridicule.)  Typing these messages at this
     keyboard has often been an emotional  experience, but  it's never
     before brought tears to my eyes.

          Goodbye.  I'll miss you.

     Editors Comments:
          Thank you very much for these parting words Thom. I too have
     have had many an emotional experience at this  keyboard, but this
     last message  of yours  has been  the most emotional of all. Good
     luck in whatever you do. You will be missed.    --    Dale

         The FidoNet Sysop's Bill of Rights!  Or ...
            How to Make the Net Truly Democratic


     By Randy Edwards
        132/555


        This part of the article in the back of FidoNews #501
     (by Don Daniels) started me thinking:

     >    Essentially, each coordinator operates as a sort
     > of "dictator" with full responsibility for his domain.
     > You have no direct control over how he operates - the only
     > mechanism you have (short of dropping out of his domain) to
     > attempt any control over him is to convince his "boss"
     > coordinator (who in many cases made the appointment in the
     > first place) that your coordinator is not doing the job.
     >    No easy task.

        Don's right, it's no easy task.  And if you look at most
     of the present and recent controversies in the Network they
     can be directly related (or caused!) by this 'problem.'

        So thinking about this I came up with the following:
     (comments are welcome in the IFNA, SYSOP of POLICY4 echos)


           [*]  THE FIDONET SYSOP'S BILL OF RIGHTS  [*]

     [1]  No node may delete or modify (except modification by
     recognized netmail utilities) intransit netmail unless it
     is obviously illegal in nature.  Copying or recording of
     intransit messages is forbidden.  An exception to this right
     is prior agreement between all parties.

     [2]  No node may delete or modify (except modification by
     recognized net/echomail utilities) intransit echomail unless
     it is obviously illegal in nature.  An exception to this
     rule is an agreed-upon conference moderator.  All nodes must
     do any local modification or deletion ('chopping' or 'ed-
     meeseing') of echomail after it is scanned.

     [3]  Every node has the right to choose to be listed in
     either  the local geographic network, or as an independent
     node in the local geographic region.

     [4]  Every network will have an Election every 12 months.
     The election will be held in June, in honor of the month the
     original FidoNet converted nodelists.  Every node in the
     network will have one vote towards the position of Network
     Coordinator.  Elections are won by straight majority, but
     elections that are not won by more than 5% are submitted to
     an automatic revote within 30 days.  This is to ensure the
     winner of an election has enough support to work effectively
     and to help prevent controversial election results.
     FidoNews 5-02                Page 9                   11 Jan 1988


        The Network Coordinator, upon election, will name an
     assistant and served until the following June when a new
     election will be held.  The Network Coordinator will act as
     a combination 'Prime Minister' and 'Representative' of the
     Net in addition to any other duties outlined in Policy4.

        Additionally, if there are 5 or more independant nodes
     in a Region, (termed a 'Group') they are also encouraged to
     have similar elections as above selecting one person to be
     thier Representative, though their position will be in an
     unofficial capacity (see below).

     [5]  If at any time during a Network Coordinators term of
     office, if 34% of the nodes in the network agree they can
     submit a Request for Recall to the Network and Regional
     Coordinators, who will have 2 weeks to verify the Request
     for Recall and respond to the plantiffs.  Within 60 days of
     the Request for Recall a new election will be held (unless
     the June election is within 60 days).

     [6]  Every region will have an Election every 12 months.
     The election will be held in August, in honor of the month
     the first FidoCon and the birth (or abortion? B-) of IFNA.
     Every Network Coordinator in the Region will have one vote
     towards the position of Network Coordinator. Additionally,
     if a Region has 5 or more independant nodes in it and the
     nodes have elected a Representative (see above), then that
     Representative is given one vote in Regional elections.  The
     Regional Coordinator, upon election, will name an assistant
     and served until the following August when a new election
     will be held.  The Network Coordinator will act as a
     combination 'Prime Minister' and 'Representative' of the
     Region, in addition to any other duties outlined in Policy4.

     [7]  If at any time during a Regional Coordinators term of
     office, if 34% of the Network Coordinators (plus one vote
     for a qualified 5+ elected independant regional
     Representative) in the region agree they can submit a
     Request for Recall to the Regional and Zone Coordinators,
     who will have 2 weeks to verify the Request for Recall and
     respond to the plantiffs. Within 60 days of the Request for
     Recall a new election will be held (unless the August
     election is within 60 days).

     [8]  Every zone will have an Election every 12 months.  The
     election will be held in September, in honor of the month
     the first St. Louis nodelist.  Every Regional Coordinator in
     the Zone will have one vote towards the position of Zone
     Coordinator.  The Zone Coordinator, upon election, will name
     an assistant and served until the following September when a
     new election will be held.  The Zone Coordinator will act as
     a combination 'Prime Minister' and 'Representative' of the
     Zone in addition to any other duties outlined in Policy4.

        Additionally, if there are 5 or more qualified Groups in
     a Zone, they are also encouraged to have similar elections
     FidoNews 5-02                Page 10                  11 Jan 1988


     as above selecting one person to be thier Representative,
     though their position will be in an unofficial capacity (see
     below).

     [9]  If at any time during a Zone Coordinators term of
     office, if 34% of the Regional Coordinators (plus one vote
     for a qualified 5+ Group) in the zone agree they can submit
     a Request for Recall to the Zone and Int'l Coordinators, who
     will have 2 weeks to verify the Request for Recall and
     respond to the plantiffs.  Within 60 days of the Request for
     Recall a new election will be held(unless the August
     election is within 60 days).

     [10]  An amendment or deletion to this Bill of Rights can be
     done by a Constitional Convention.  The exact procedure is
     this:  If a node wishes an amendment or deletion (which
     should be thought out carefully, for it is a very serious
     matter) he must write up a Proposal for the amendment or
     deletion stating the reasons for a change.  The Proposal is
     then submitted to each of the Regional Coordinators and to
     the Zone Coordinator. Upon receipt the Regional Coordinators
     have 60 days to vote on the Proposal and notify the Zone
     Coordinator of their vote.  The Zone Coordinator will then
     tally the votes and notify the RC's and the Node who
     submitted the proposal of the RC's vote.  If the RC's vote
     90% in favor For the amendment or deletion then the Proposal
     is submitted for a Zone Constitutional Vote.

        The Zone Constitutional Vote (ZCV) is done in June.
     Every Node in the Network votes on a ZCV.  The ZCV is done
     by placing the Proposal on each individual Network's (and
     qualified Regional Group's) ballot for Network Coordinator.
     Each Network Coordinator will then tally his/her Network's
     ZCV vote and submit it to the Zone Coordinator who has 30
     days to add up the total ZCV vote and report it to the RC's
     and NC's.

        The ZCV vote is won on a straight majority count of votes
     - but for a change to this Bill of Rights to take place the
     Proposal must 'win' the vote by at least 5% - if the
     proposal wins, but does not win by 5% then the Proposal is
     considered too controversial and is held over for an
     automatic revote the following June.


     --- End of the Bill of Rights.

        REDCON/GEDCON have been going thru several changes
     in recent months. REDCON now handles over 200 ECHO's.
     It's a full time job keeping up with the changes. REDCON
     is now running AUTOECHO to help with some of the work.

        Because REDCON is in a PC Pursuit city the traffic
     has been very heavy. All weekend long the machine sends
     and receives traffic.

        Thanks to the efforts of all the users feedback loops
     in the echomail paths have been, for the most part, avoided.

        GEDCON has been slower to develop. Because GEDCON's
     users are billed for the time on the system monthly. An
     accounting program had to be written. That is now done.
     Also an automatic billing system is in place. So as time
     permit we will be adding users again.

        To other ECHOMAIL BACKBONE(tm) sysops. Please contact us
     so we may better coordinate our efforts to provide ECHOMAIL
     services to the nodes of an even stronger FidoNet.

        A list of the ECHOMAIL handled by REDCON/GEDCON is in
     a file REDCON.ARC which may be requested from 151/100 or
     151/1000. Soon AUTOECHO will respond to the QUERY option
     and send a message to any requesting system all the echo's
     available.

                           Thoughts on AlterNet
                                 Jon Sabol



          I'm still  here although  I don't say much. Just thought I'd
     post my ideas on what's going on and how I  think AlterNet should
     be dealt   with. Don't know if the opinion carries any weight any
     more, but what the  hell. This  IS  supposed  to  be  a  forum to
     discuss things like this.

          The creation  of something like AlterNet has been inevitable
     since the formation of IFNA. TechNet was the  forerunner of this,
     but it   wasn't quite as radical. TechNet was a parallel network;
     AlterNet is an   entity  which  seems  to  be  trying  to replace
     FidoNet  while  still  maintaining    ties to the current base of
     people  running  FidoNet  compatible  boards.     TechNet  was  a
     reasonable  approach.  It  provided  the security of an alternate
     network while not imposing  ideals and  practices on  the current
     network.     AlterNet  seems  to  be  an  attempt  to  create  an
     environment favorable to its  peers, with no  real regard  of the
     current status of affairs in the Net.  This is unhealthy.

          The whole  premise of  FidoNet, and  its main function is to
     allow  as many people who are interested in telecommunications to
     use  it  as  a  tool    to pass ideas amongst themselves. In this
     aspect, FidoNet serves the  purpose quite well.

          Fragmentation of  the  network  is  inevitable.  If AlterNet
     does  not branch off, then there will be other groups that choose
     to leave the  established structure  to form  groups which appear
     to be  more advantageous  either technically or politically. This
     is only the  effect  caused  by    bringing  a  number  of highly
     independant people together in an organization.

          The founders  of AlterNet  cite 'flames' as being the reason
     to split into a separate group. They say that things  aren't 'fun
     any more'.   I think its closer to the truth to say that they are
     having a hard time   dealing  with dissention.  Its hard  to feel
     what you  are saying is right when  you get scathing replies from
     other folks. Its even harder when people base  their reactions on
     previous events - i.e. hold grudges. That part of the  problem is
     our fault. Its far easier to create a masterpiece of  debate that
     rips your opponent to pieces than it is to sit back and ask a few
     questions  to see if what  you  read  is  really  what  the other
     person typed.  The biggest   problem with this media is that what
     is read is sometimes  different from   the  typed word.  Even the
     spoken word  on a telephone imparts more of the  author's meaning
     than what is portrayed in a conference message.

          (<sigh> I'm in Shackelford mode again :->)

          Most of the personality conflicts in  the network  stem from
     the impersonality  of the  media. The  same words  spoken face to
     face more  often  than not  would not  be offensive.  Its hard to
     realize that  your own   opinion is not the only one when all you
     FidoNews 5-02                Page 14                  11 Jan 1988


     see are differing opinions  that   are stated  more like personal
     attacks  than  logical  rebuttals.  This  is  the   aspect of the
     problem that needs to be worked on. You'll never get a group   of
     3000 people  together that totally agree on everything. We should
     concentrate on  teaching people  the proper  etiquette for public
     debate, not  encourage personal attacks and confrontations.

          AlterNet  refers  to  'the  good ol' days'. Times when there
     weren't   such  heated  arguments  and  personality  clashes. The
     reason that  things are   as they are now is the medium the folks
     in this conference are supposed to  be  helping with  - EchoMail.
     Almost two  years ago,  this means  of  communicating was formed.
     Until  EchoMail's  inception,  there  was  no  real    forum  for
     discussion amongst the Net. How many of you actually used FidoNet
     to the extent you  do now  before the  idea of  conferencing came
     about??? I  bet your message volume was at most one tenth of what
     it is today.

          We  have  grown  a   lot,   and   we   are   still  growing.
     Unfortunately,   our ability  to deal  with other  people has not
     kept up with the explosion of  forums and topics available. Until
     we learn  to treat  each other as human  beings, and until we can
     deal  with  problems  impersonally,  we  will  continue    to see
     offshoots from  the organization  we belong  to now.  This is the
     real    problem.  There  is  nothing  wrong  with  the  structure
     currently  -  we  just    can't  seem  to manage to disagree in a
     reasonable fashion. That's what needs  to be worked on.

          AlterNet has some aspects  that  I  absolutely  cannot agree
     with,   nor condone.  IFNA is  in the  same boat.  We should work
     together to build  something that is agreeable  with the majority
     instead of  striking out on  our own to do what we feel is right.
     Leaving the system is a cop out. Its  saying 'well, if  you won't
     play my way, I'll take my ball and go home'. The  proper approach
     is to try to convince the players to agree to play  differently.

          The political aspects of AlterNet could  very well influence
     the current state of affairs of FidoNet adversely. We can prevent
     this by  limiting  its  ability  to  communicate  to  the general
     forums. As  Ray says,  we  should not be forced to spend money to
     support the transmission of messages    from  an  entity  that is
     profiting from  our expense. We should not allow the  conferences
     carried on AlterNet  to  intermingle  with  those  established in
     FidoNet. We  can prevent  this if  we try. By allowing it, we are
     condoning  the fragmentation of the entity that  is the  basis of
     our fraternity.  When  someone decides to 'take their ball and go
     home', you don't respond with  'well, if you're going,  you might
     as well take this bat with you'.

          The group  of people that form the backbone and the EchoMail
     Coordinators is the grass roots faction  of FidoNet.  We all have
     very  differing political views, but we realize that without this
     means of  communication, there is not enough  interaction between
     the various  people   to warrant any type of organization. We are
     in desparate need  of  SOME  sort    of  central  coordination to
     oversee the  rapid growth we are experiencing.  The keys here are

     'amateur', 'hobby', and 'free'. Let's see if we can't   help keep
     the group together, instead of promoting splintering according to
     point of view.
