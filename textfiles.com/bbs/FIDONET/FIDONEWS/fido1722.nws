                         What's Not in the Headlines

     If Fidonews seems focused on Zone 1 issues for the last month, it's
     only because the editor resides in Zone 1 and doesn't access the
     echoes carrying news from other zones.  Nonetheless, Fidonews is for
     all zones, waiting only for reports - possibly from YOU.  Here are a
     couple of developments which have seen little development in
     Fidonews... information would be appreciated from anyone close to
     the action:

     1.  Is there really a Z2C election going on?  This was hinted at
     last year, announced this year... and then the silence has been
     deafening.  News from the Silent Zone would be appreciated.

     2.  What really happened in the Zone 3 election last year?  The
     old Z3C resigned, the word was that Malcolm Miles was a likely
     successor, but Malcolm's own posting indicated that no one was
     willing to take the Z3C position.  Shortly thereafter, Malcolm was
     announced as the new Z3C.  Though I'm sure the results are accepted
     in Zone 3, I suspect that there's more to the story than this.
     Anyone from Zone 3 care to fill the rest of us in?

                               Bob Satti Speaks

     The discussion in the echo Z1C, which has been the subject of my
     last two editorials, seems to have moved onto other subjects.  At
     the risk of beating a dead horse, however, I would like to present a
     letter from Bob Satti which resulted from that discussion (or
     rather, a parallel one in the more restricted echo Z1REGCON).  The
     letter was originally to Dallas Hinton and posted May 9, 2000 - then
     cross-posted to Z1C by Ross Cassell the next day.  Though the letter
     is no longer timely, it is notable in that it's the longest message
     I've ever seen authored by Bob Satti, and it offers us insight into
     how at least one aspect of the Z1C position has been handled in the
     past.

     ---------- Echomail from Bob Satti ----------

     DH> You've been conspicuously quiet throughout this region segment
     DH> issue;

      That's because I am an 'invited guest' in this echo, now that I am
     neither a ZC nor an RC. Until I am 'invited' to participate I watch
     and listen...

     DH> I'd appreciate your comments, given that you never missed
     DH> generating a correct segment the entire time you were ZC.

      Well... I can certainly sympathize with David's real life issues
     getting in the way. I've certainly had my share of those over the
     past few years... There were times when my netmail area was so full
     of unanswered mail that I wasn't sure where to start.

      Having said that, there were a few priorities that were always
     dealt with, no matter how serious the real life problems were.

      - Turning out a timely nodediff, with all the RC updates included.

      - Keeping my system operational so that the above could be
        accomplished.

      - Maintaining my batch and control files so that the above could be
        accomplished.

      There are many smaller items that relate directly to the above.

      . Exchanging mail (and phone calls) with RC's over problems with
        processing segments or connecting, changes in RC's, etc.
     FIDONEWS 17-22               Page 3                   29 May 2000


      . Maintaining more than one copy of the required files to process a
        valid nodelist.

      . Having more than one system capable of (and ready to) process the
        nodelist in a timely manner.

      . Having a backup person with the knowledge and access (both
        physical and by modem) to deal with the system and process in my
        absence; regardless of whether it be by accident, illness,
        holiday or work.

      . Staying completely aware of the successful operation and
        completion of each and every process (in my case by pager when
        unable to monitor directly) I have an extremely complex network
        with between 16 and 24 computers running that cross monitor each
        other and keep me aware of their problems and progress via pager
        at all times.

      There are many other little things, but you get the idea. Though
     I've seen many of you comment on my 'periods of absence'. There was
     never a single day in my 6+ years as Z1C that my system wasn't
     monitored and the mail wasn't _read_ by either myself or by my
     backup person. If there were nodelist based problems, they were
     dealt with quickly.

      My system could tell if I had used my mail reader that day, and if
     not it was able to notify my backup person that I wasn't reading my
     mail. This covered problems like my going into hospital without
     warning, which happened on more than one occasion.

      Those of you that have been around for that length of time can
     attest to the fact that my systems were always available and
     operational, and that your segments were processed. The only reason
     for that is because I took great pains to see that it happened, not
     just most of the time, but ALL of the time.

      Now, lets get down to the business at hand. Not answering mail, and
     not processing segments. There are many reasons to not answer mail
     right away (or sometimes at all), and I've discussed them at length
     in this echo on previous occasions. I do have a problem with not
     answering RC's mail, especially with regards to nodelist processing
     based problems.

      I understand that David has much going on right now with real life
     getting in the way. I can only suggest that he might wish to avail
     himself of some of the techniques and resources that I have used
     over the years to keep things running when my real life got in the
     way.

      In my case, almost all of it was set up beforehand. I anticipated
     that things could go wrong that might cause me to be unable to deal
     with my system or you folks and set up my system (and frankly my
     life) in such a way that a working and valid nodediff would go out
     no matter what.

      David has been afforded no such luxury. Right off the bat, before
     FIDONEWS 17-22               Page 4                   29 May 2000


     we could even get him set up as ZC his 'real life' started to get in
     the way. He hasn't had time to get some thing set up properly at
     all, let alone get organized in such a way as to have backup plans
     for virtually every possible failure or screw up.

      While I sent him my batch files and reviewed his changes to them to
     make them work on his system, there are more things involved than
     just a few batch files. One of the KEY components is a backup
     person. Another is the pager system... While I can strongly urge
     David to get or use a pager in the same manner that I have used one
     (I'd be glad to assist him in setting it up), I would say that a
     backup person with electronic (if not physical) access and the
     knowledge to assist in or repair the process is paramount. Physical
     access can always be arranged for this person by arranging for a
     non-Fidonet person with physical access to be available by phone for
     rebooting etc.

      There are ways to handle almost any foreseeable problem, and I'd be
     happy to share the ways that I have found with David (or any of
     you).

      David, please avail yourself of the plethora of assistance and
     knowledge here at your disposal so that you can get your system
     operating at peak efficiency. There are at LEAST two people here
     that have intimate knowledge of my system, my backup system, my
     pager system, and my contingency plans that I know would be happy to
     share any knowledge you need.

      As well, it is paramount that you arrange for someone to assist
     you, with electronic access so that during your times of 'real life
     getting in the way' things can move along as you (and we) need them
     to. If you haven't the time to arrange such a person or the access,
     I'm sure assistance could also be arranged for that.

      I understand that there are 'trust issues' involved in allowing
     complete electronic access to one's system. I had to weigh that
     myself on more than one occasion. I currently have 6 people with
     physical access and 5 people with electronic access to my system.
     That is one of the many adjustments I made to my life to accommodate
     the responsibility of producing/delivering the nodediff each week. I
     can even offer some helpful hints with regards to that if you would
     like. |-)

      I could write an entire message about some of the antics that have
     occurred over the years to see that you folks got a nodediff. There
     was the night that I lost all my telephone lines to a flood and had
     to drive the processed nodediff to an adjacent city to have it
     delivered by another system. There was the night that we fought with
     a hanging system (remotely from 300 miles away using a borrowed
     laptop and a borrowed telephone line) for over 4 hours to get the
     nodediff out on time. We were just about ready to 'drive for it'
     when we caught the errant batch file at the right moment and fixed
     it remotely.

      I've delivered the nodediff by ham radio and packet modem. I've
     fixed system problems that way too. I've driven through the night in
     FIDONEWS 17-22               Page 5                   29 May 2000


     a monsoon from our campsite to replace a dead hard drive so that the
     nodediff could go out on time. I've talked a computer illiterate
     friend through a computer rebuild via cell phone from hundreds of
     miles away. The list is long, and sometimes quite funny.

      Those were at times when I was able to do something about the
      problems.

      There are times when real life gets in the way and you can't.
     Dallas has told you all about some of those times that I have
     experienced.

      Those are the times when you need backup people to help.

      I'm sure we have all had our share of system problems, and 'real
     life problems' over the years. Let's help David with his 'real life
     problems' by assisting him with his system and processing. I'm sure
     there are several here willing to help... now we just need David to
     take a break from real life for long enough to communicate with us
     to set up the help he needs!

      You guys supported me through plenty of 'real-life' tough times.
     Let's give David the same kind of support that you gave me, OK?

      And David; how can we best get you set up so that we can assist
      you?

     Take Care

     Bob

                              Expectations 'R Us
                                  Doug Myers


     Coordinators in Fidonet are often referred to as "Nodelist Clerks,"
     usually in the context that they exceed their authority when
     exercising any other power normally associated with a Coordinator
     position.  Certainly, Bob Satti has satisfied all reasonable
     expectations of a nodelist clerk, in my humble opinion.  Indeed,
     I would have been willing to accept a local monsoon as a legitimate
     reason for a missed or delayed nodediff; nor would I expect an
     individual to network twenty or so computers together to keep the
     show on the road.  It's fair to say that Bob went beyond the call of
     duty in maintaining the nodelist for Fidonet.

     But if Bob Satti was such a superlative nodelist clerk, why was his
     six year term of Zone 1 Coordinator marked by such loud criticism,
     particularly in the latter years?  Could it be that the sysops of
     Fidonet actually expect much more of a Coordinator than they're
     willing to let on?  More than they're even aware of?

     FIDONEWS 17-22               Page 6                   29 May 2000


     And if nodelist clerking is only part of the total job, why is David
     Moufarrege subject to such recent criticism for the glitches from
     one region?

     I suspect that Fidonet will never find the perfect coordinator,
     simply because our expectations are so high.  It seems that a
     coordinator is expected to right all wrongs while assuming no
     authority whatsoever; conceive a direction for Fidonet while not
     actually telling anyone where to go; and above all communicate
     personally with everyone while keeping this a hobby.

     Oh well... even the Messiah failed expectations when he didn't lead
     an army against the Roman Empire...

                        Response to Bob Davidson's Net

     This email was originally from Darrell Salter (1:229/2) to Perry
     Smith (1:163/117) and forwarded to Fidonews by Darrell.

     ---------------

     PS> Andrea Santos directed my attention to your recent article in
     PS> the Fidonews relating to the loss of Bob Davidson.  Our net is
     PS> just starting to pick up the pieces since he died.

     I'm sure it's tough. It was a terrible shock for us all, but for the
     members of his net, even more so. My deepest condolences on the lost
     of your good friend and fellow sysop.

     PS> Thank you for having submitted such a moving and honest article
     PS> on our good friend and fellow sysop.

     Bob was not given to drawing attention to himself. It would be easy
     to underestimate how many people Bob touched in this organization
     known as Fidonet. He was one of the best Fidonet sysops I have had
     the pleasure to have known.

     My thanks go out to Douglas Myers, the Fidonews editor, for
     graciously seeing to it that Fidonet was notified via the Fidonews.

                                   My Heart
                          Thanks to Peggy Hollinger

     One day a young man was standing in the middle of the town
     proclaiming that he had the most beautiful heart in the whole
     valley. A large crowd gathered and they all admired his heart for it
     was  perfect. There was not a mark or a flaw in it. Yes, they all
     agreed it truly was the most beautiful heart they had ever seen. The
     young man was very proud and boasted more loudly about his beautiful
     heart.

     Suddenly, an old man appeared at the front of the crowd and said
     "Why your heart is not nearly as beautiful as mine."

     The crowd and the young man looked at the old man's heart. It was
     beating strongly, but full of scars, it had places where pieces had
     been removed and other pieces put in, but they didn't fit quite
     right and there were several jagged edges. In fact, in some places
     there were deep gouges where whole pieces were missing.

     The people stared -- how can he say his heart is more beautiful,
     they thought?

     The young man looked at the old man's heart and saw its state and
     laughed.  "You must be joking," he said. "Compare your heart with
     mine, mine is perfect and yours is a mess of scars and tears."
     FIDONEWS 17-22               Page 11                  29 May 2000


     "Yes," said the old man, "Yours is perfect looking but I would never
     trade with you. You see, every scar represents a person to whom I
     have given my love - I tear out a piece of my heart and give it to
     them, and often they give me a piece of their heart which fits into
     the empty place in my heart, but because the pieces aren't exact, I
     have some rough edges, which I cherish, because they remind me of
     the love we shared."

     "Sometimes I have given pieces of my heart away, and the other
     person hasn't returned a piece of his heart to me. These are the
     empty gouges -- giving love is taking a chance. Although these
     gouges are painful, they stay open, reminding me of the love I have
     for these people too, and I hope someday they may return and fill
     the space I have waiting."

     "So now do you see what true beauty is?"

     The young man stood silently with tears running down his cheeks. He
     walked up to the old man, reached into his perfect young and
     beautiful heart, and ripped a piece out. He offered it to the old
     man with trembling hands.

     The old man took his offering, placed it in his heart and then took
     a piece from his old scarred heart and placed it in the wound in the
     young man's heart. It fit, but not perfectly, as there were some
     jagged  edges.

     The young man looked at his heart, not perfect anymore but more
     beautiful than ever, since love from the old man's heart flowed into
     his. They embraced and walked away side by side.

                                  COLUMNS

                               Ol'WDB's Column
                              Olympic Joke Tank
                             wdbonner@pacbell.net

     Three guys were trying to sneak into the Olympic Village to scoop
     souvenirs and autographs. The first says, "Let's watch the
     registration table to see if there's a crack in the security system
     that we can utilize to scam our way in."

     Immediately, a burly athlete walks up to the table and states,
     "Angus MacPherson.  Scotland.  Shotput."  He opens his gym bag to
     display a shotput to the registration attendant.

     The attendant says, "Very good, Mr. MacPherson.  Here is your packet
     of registration materials, complete with hotel keys, passes to all
     Olympic events, meal tickets, and other information."

     The first guy gets inspired and grabs a small tree sapling, strips
     off the limbs and roots, walks up the registration table and states:
     "Chuck Wagon.  Canada.  Javelin."

     The attendant says, "Very good, Mr. Wagon.  Here is your packet of
     registration materials, hotel keys, passes, meal tickets, and so
     forth.  Good luck!"

     The second guy grabs a street utility manhole cover, walks up to the
     registration table and states: "Dusty Rhodes.  Australia. Discus."

     The attendant says, "Terrific, Mr. Rhodes.  Here is your packet of
     registration materials, hotel keys, a full set of passes, and meal
     tickets.  Enjoy yourself."

     They scamper in, but suddenly realize the third guy is missing. They
     groan, because he's a simpleton from the hills of Vermont. They
     forgot to make sure he doesn't do something stupid and blow their
     cover stories.

     Just then he walks proudly up to the table with a roll of barbed
     wire under his arm and states: "Foster Bean.  Hardwick, Vermont.
     Fencing."
     ^^^^^^^^          Well,  DUH !!!

     Where? http://vagabond.virtualave.net/

                                What's it got?

     It's a software page. Not just any software.... This is a door game
     support site. The "author" of many of the doors is not really the
     "author". Now, you're probably thinking that I'm talking in riddles
     but, read on.

     Bryan is doing something, in my opinion, great for Fidonet and BBS.
     When a door game author decides to quit supporting his/her doors,
     Bryan will take over the doors and provide upgrades and support.
     Also, he will generally offer the doors as "postcard ware". What
     this means is that to register the door, you send him a postcard and
     he will send you the registration. Now, not just any postcard will
     do. Don't jump into your local Post office and get the cheap "plain
     jane" cards. Go find a nice or "cute" card that may be a little more
     expensive, but has some picture on it. Why???  The postcards are for
     his daughter and she likes to collect them. :) Best advice is to
     read the "register" file that is in the archive.

     Ok, so what games are available?  Several "GAC" doors such as
     "BlackJack", "Freecell" and such. Some L.O.R.D. IGMs, EasyDoor,
     Operation Overkill and many other doors and utilities.

     What I would recommend is that you visit this site and let the pages
     tell you about it all. I've registered some of the "GAC" doors and I
     will tell you that this is really true... You just send a postcard
     for each game Bryan offers and you get the registration. What more
     could you ask? :)

     Check this out and get some games on your BBS. :)

     Till next time,

     Frank - flv@texoma.net

     "Congratulations on your wedding day! Too bad no one likes your
     wife."

     "How could two people as beautiful you have such an ugly baby?"

     "I've always wanted to have someone to hold, someone to love. After
     having met you, I've changed my mind."

     "I must admit, you brought Religion in my life. I never believed in
     Hell 'til I met you."

     "Looking back over the years that we've been together, I can't help
     but wonder: What the hell was I thinking?"

     "As the days go by, I think of how lucky I am that you're not here
     to ruin it for me."

     "If I get only one thing for Christmas, I hope it's your sister."

     "As you grow older, Mum, I think of all the gifts you've given me.
     Like the need for therapy..."

     "Thanks for being a part of my life!!!I never knew what evil was
     before this!"

     "Congratulations on your promotion.  Before you go, I would like to
     take this knife out of my back. You'll probably need it again."

     "Someday I hope to get married, but not to you."

     "Sorry things didn't work out, but I can't handle guys with boobs
     that are bigger than mine."

     "Happy Birthday! You look great for your age...Almost Lifelike!"

     "When we were together, you always said you'd die for me.  Now that
     we've broke up, I think it's time you kept your promise."

     "I knew the day would come when you would leave me for my best
     friend.  So here's his leash, water bowl and chew toys."

     "We have been friends for a very long time, what say we call it
     quits."

     who the father was?"

     "You are such a good friend that if we were on a sinking ship and
     there was only one life jacket.... I'd miss you heaps and think of
     you often."

     "Your friends and I wanted to do something special for your
