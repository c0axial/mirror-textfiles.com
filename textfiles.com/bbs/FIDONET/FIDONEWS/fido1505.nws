                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================

     The Zone 1 Nodelist is only up to the Zone 2 360 diff file of 1997
     and here we are five weeks into 1998. [sigh]

     There are more Zone 6 complaints from Zone 6 folks in this edition.
     Without an IC in place, WHO is going to help these people over there?

     The ZEC1 election for Head Echomail Weenie [HEW?] in Zone 1 is still
     going strong and more responses appear today. All Echomail weenies in
     Zone 1 should be sure to cast their votes while they have the chance.

     On the Internet front, those of you with Internet access should try a
     fabulous communication program called ICQ {I Seek You} available from
     www.mirabilis.com. It does just about everything including talking. It
     allows you to chat, send instant messages [IMs], send files, as well
     as tracking the online status of all your ICQ registered contacts.
     It's free and it's a lot of fun!

     For those of you not on AOL but with contacts there, you can download
     AOL Instant Messenger {AIM} to track their screen names and exchange
     IMs with them from outside AOL via your standard ISP connection. Go
     to www.aol.com for that free program. AOLers should also know that
     ICQ will operate from INSIDE your standard AOL environment, too. AIM
     doesn't do chats at present but may eventually.

     Here in the U.S.A., February 2nd is Groundhog Day. Theoretically, if
     the groundhog in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, comes out of his hole and
     sees his [his name is Phil] shadow, winter will continue for six more
     weeks. If he doesn't see his shadow, then spring will be six weeks
     early. It's not an official day off [except maybe in Punxsutawney] but
     it's become a American nonsense tradition every year. You may have
     seen movie starring Bill Murray and Andie McDowell called, "Groundhog
     Day" which explains the whole thing more succinctly.

     I'm at a complete loss to understand how Andrea ignored my answers

     If she'd been keeping up with the reading and the candidates posts
     in the echo, she would have noted my answers. Again, it is easily
     assumed that when someone decides to take the responsibility or
     collecting and reporting the date from the election, that the person
     that decides to do so will do so in an impartial manner. It would
     appear that Andrea cannot.

     And yet Andrea still ignored the answers that were posted in the
     echo to either the individuals that posted the questions or all.
     She still limits the format so that any question that requires an
     explanation more then just the simple yes/no format does not
     receive proper representation.

     Which is incorrect. There are still no standards other then P4. Each
     region has it's own standards from RC down as to how they're handling
     this issue. This is up to the regions until such time as a standard
     is established or P4 is amended. I do not believe in micro-management.

     That is correct, and therefore you've invalidated your own format

     Again, if Andrea is going to take on the responsibility of collecting
     data for the sake of informing the sysops, she should also keep up
     with the reading in the echo.

     Misleading in the sense that the sysops are not clearly informed
     as to the experience levels. There is a large difference between
     an active, seated and functioning REC then just an interim REC.
     The sysops should be aware of this. There has only been two active
     REC's from Reg 13 since I have been an REC and they have been Jim
     Balcom and Rick Ashworth. Even David's participation in the effort
     to get this election going was minimal. To understand this better,
     any person that was an REC at any time has access to the RECC echo.

     It would appear that in Andrea's opinion, the world is black and
     white as all answers should be.

     This is correct, ergo the format Andrea has used is invalid.

     This was clear from the day I answered it. If Andrea chose to ignore
     this, then she again misrepresents the answers.

     It makes quite a difference and the sysops should be aware of it.

     Poor use of the language. I am not the "acting" RC, I am the RC.

     > There have been no elections for
     > either post since he took on those positions.  Bob's own actions

     Andrea also ignores the posts originating in late Dec where I once
     again state the disposition of the REC 10 position which will be
     passed at the end of the election.

     She's ignored my statement that I felt I had something to accomplish
     in "ramrodding" the effort this get this election done (Jim Balcoms'
     word). I got the election going and can retire the R10EC hat on a
     high note.

     She further ignores the posts in the echo that noted my commitment
     made to the position of the RC. I honor those commitments even those
     made to someone I don't care for. I've revived Reg 10 with the help
     of several good people and have a commitment to it.

     Andrea has clearly shown that she was not impartial in the collecting
     of this date nor the way she presented it. As Ken Tuley notes:

     That may be true for some people, but as far as I'm concerned, the
     only thing that ought to be made clear is that the table consists of
     =your= interpretation of candidates' statements and positions and not
     a compilation of direct candidate input. Then people would be able to
     read it for what it as: =your= opinion.

     Once again, misleading.

     I have no clear preference on this issue. I feel that sysop level
     input is crucial as noted in the way we set up this election.
     However until such time as there is a standard or P4 is amended
     the regions deal with this in their own way. I do not believe
     in micro-management.

     Again: yes. I do note she spotting my response in the news and yet
     decided not to incorporate it. She did not spot the answer in the
     echo and I answered this at least twice.

     without bans, without EXCOM's or PC's.

     be a hub standard that puts an end to  mail tampering based on moods,
     agenda's, etc.

     Again.. misleading.  As I've noted in the election echo, I think it
     is a conflict of interest for the ZEC to run a distribution system.
     The ZEC should NOT be affiliated in any way, shape or form with a
     distribution system. I also think at this time it's impractical to
     enforce this on a REC level since we have or had three REC's running
     distribution systems.

     In the future this is something that could stand to be resolved,
     since up until recently is was considered a conflict of interest
     for an REC to do so.

     > |Should *C's be involved with    | ?  | Y  | Y  | Y  | U  | Y  | ?

     Misleading. The filebone, filegate, etc is not an issue for the ZEC
     in my opinion.

     The ZEC works with the REC's who work with the NEC's. The ZEC should
     be able to work with the REC's who should be able to work with the
     NEC's.

     It would have been so much easier had Andrea re-formatted her "data".
     It would have been far more beneficial to the sysops had she imparted
     this date impartially.

     Where are comments like the above allowable?  Is there a forum in Fido
     where people are accorded a chance to critique where they perceive to
     be problems in their small part of this wonderful world of cyberspace?

     I realize that this being listed as FidoNews that perhaps comments
     should be limited to FidoNews but it seems with the 5 or 6 different
     Fido administration areas there could be one where just about anything
     goes as long as it pertains to Fido, such as the above comment.  In
     all honesty I don't have a complaint about what goes on with Fido in
     my particular neck of the woods since everyone here seems to stick to
     the straight and narrow (i.e. no planned coups or anything like that
     or at least that I am aware of <g>) but it would be nice to be able to
     see what is happening, or perceived to be happening, in other parts of
     the world which is one of the reasons I signed up with Fido.  That and
     the fact that I don't care much for the glitz with the little or no
     substance of www.  But that's a different can of worms ... or is it?

     There are certainly echos to discuss almost anything you'd like.
     There are hundreds of echos, some with very specific topics, some with
     more general ones.  Find one that suits your needs for the topic you
     want to discuss.  I'd like to follow this echo, but don't care about

     Vincent's paranoia and childish whinings.  The moderator has asked him
     to get back on topic.  Vincent has ignored Chris's request.  As is the
     case with most of the busy backboned echos with a huge signal to noise
     ratio, I'll probably just end up turning this one off because there's
     so little on-topic content.  This, to me, is the real reason behind
     the "death of Fidonet".

     (With apologies to Our Editor...)

     First, this is a forum for the _Editor_ of FidoNews to receive
     articles for inclusion in FidoNews, as well as for pretty much
     discussion of items of interest for inclusion in future articles.

     If Vincent Kaye had bothered to take his ideas and express them in a
     coherent manner, as an article for submission, then he would have been
     'on topic'.

     Second, had he been discussing an article already published, then the
     NEWSCHAT echo would be the likely place to discuss.

     Third, a look at the EchoList and other distributions would indicate
     several areas, but specifically, those based on both FidoNet and
     SysOps would be the likely ones to look into, such as:

              FN_SYSOP
     FIDONEWS 15-05               Page 13                   2 Feb 1998


              SYSOP
              SYSOP_ISSUES
              SYSOPS
              Z1_CHAT
              Z1_FIDONET
              Z1_POLITICAL

     and that's a start.  There is also DEBATE, REAL FREE SPEECH, FLAME and
     others where it may not be _on_ topic, but close enough to be allowed.

     Vincent, on the other hand, is pretty much just wasting electrons with
     his antics here, though I haven't been too vocal in arguing against
     him...if he pushes the envelope too far, then Our Editor will know how
     to deal with him.

     Seems that you've caught on...and also asked a few questions some
     moderators need to examine.  As moderator of FN_SYSOP, you've put me
     on the spot with a couple of your comments, and I'm going to have to
     re-examine the purposes of the echo and how it is listed.

     Thanks!

     I've been in Fidonet since 1988... the same amount of time you claim,
     Bill.  I've not only gotten a husband out of the ten years I spent at
     this, I got a sense of community. I've made friends, influenced
     people, learned new ideas, helped see a wall come down between
     countries, watched another join the free world from the people's point
     of view. I travelled to the Gulf Coast with strangers, who's parents,
     spouses and siblings became my friends and I helped them keep in touch
     with those they loved far away. I learned of a friend of my friend's
     children who got kidnapped, abused and murdered. I aided the victims
     of Hurricane Hugo, was aided by others for Hurricane Andrew, sent
     sympathy, canned foods and blankets to earthquake victims and shared
     the ups and downs of this country and others with strangers who have
     become friends. I can travel the world and find someone I "know"
     almost anywhere I go.  Someone who will buy me a cup of coffee, show
     me the sights or even put me up for a few days. I've had good times
     and bad times, seen petty squabbling, friendship poems and jokes.

     I don't know about you, Bill, but I got alot of something out of the
     ten years I spent at this. Exactly what I'm not hard pressed to say,
     just hard pressed to limit to one page without boring the bejeesus out
     of others. LOL I wish you the best and hope you find whatever you're
     looking for wherever you're looking for it! :)

     Hello All,

     I belong to Net732 in R63.  We have a big problem.  Our RC was already
     got out of FidoNet (his BBS closed) about 6 months ago.  I have
     nothing to do for changing my BBS' telephone number.  Our Z6C, he post
     to the local echo in zone6 called ZONE6SYSOP saying that he wants to
     quit Z6C, but no one answers except me.  He seems to stop any job for
     nodediff.  I've never receive any diff files for a few months. Looking
     at my Net732.  My NC of 732, he also wants to quit NC, not only NC,
     but also a FidoNet node, he said.  He also stopped take care of
     Nodelist.  Several nodes in 732, but only 2 nodes are active and open
     as a FidoNet BBS.  Others were closed or unlink FidoNet.

     Z6's gate has no carry this echo, so no meaning to ask them to come
     out.  For me, I see this because I link a node in the US via ftp.  I
     want to see all echoes.   Many sysops quit, but FidoNet is still fun
     to me.  I can do something for N732, R63 and even Z6.  I'm willing to
     do for FidoNet.  I want to refresh N732, R63 as well as Z6.  How can I
     do?  Does someone give me a good idea?  Any suggestions are welcome.

        [Here we are at the second meeting of BBS Anonymous.  Those of you
         who have been paying attention might recall that we were listening
         to the sad story of Pete S., presently at the depths of despair -
         a hopeless BBSoholic - shunned by former friends, maxxed out on
         his plastic for faster modems and quicker cpu's (hah! - 386/33
         with 2 megs running bink/squish/max), shadowed everywhere by his
         local telco so he won't try to leave town.  As the scene fades
         into focus, Pete S. continues his tale of woe:]

     .................well, this Long Distance chippin' was getting me
     down - I explained it to the wife as like a trip to the drugstore to
     pick up a magazine - and I was really wishing somebody would bring
     Fido to our town - or at least, our calling area.  And it finally
     happened!  I was so happy!  Now, I could get my fixes on a local
     call!  Somebody wanted to set up a BBS in our town, (I didn't at that
     time understand how or why) and I would get to use it!  A Marriage
     Made In Heaven!

        And that's what it seemed to be - for a little while.  But then I
     began to see that there were Fidoboards, and there were fidoboards.
     This one used crummy software - a lot of options that I had become
     used to weren't offered with this one.  At first, it didn't carry my
     favorite echoes, then he got a PC dish, and tried to carry them
     _all_!  The whole backbone!  You can imagine what it was like to
     find your way around _that_ menu structure!  But worst of all, he
     turned out to be a game freak!  So it was well-nigh impossible to
     find a time that you could get in there and get a .qwk packet.  Every
     little gamoholic in town had his autodialer going to find that window
     in between the other gamers.  When the BBS went to two lines - he was
     charging money for using the games, so he could afford it - it got
     even worse.  Now, the kids were playing games in real-time, online,
     with each other!  23 hours a day!  Just imagine; an info-freak locked
     into a town with only an online video arcade!  The Marriage was in
     trouble!

        To make things worse, I  had up till then been turning some of my
     friends on to the wonders of Fido, and had been selling and installing
     modems for them so that they could enjoy this marvelous thing, too.
     And they would see me on the street, and I would ask them how they
     were enjoying the BBS.  And they would tell me, "I don't know, I gave
     up trying, I can never get in, it's always busy, what's so hot about
     this thing, anyway?"

        I began to get lightheaded.  The sound of busy signals started to
     get to my very inner psyche.  That's all I can imagine to explain my
     next move.  A young friend of mine got ahold of a distribution copy of
     a well-known but inferior "instant BBS" and ran the install program
     one evening when he had a half-hour to spare, and phoned me and asked
     me to call it and play around a bit.

        Whoa!  My first taste of Overproof!  This thing looked like a BBS!
     We went into chat mode, and I asked him what had been involved in
     FIDONEWS 15-05               Page 17                   2 Feb 1998


     setting it up.  He told me he'd unzipped the distribution copy about
     an hour before that, and bingo!  I'd had no idea that these things
     could be put together so fast!  My brain started calculating the cost
     of an extra computer to run this thing full time, and the price of a
     phone line, and I was HOOKED!  I was going to the city the next week
     anyway, and I returned with a beat-up Zenith 286 with 640K, and ST251,
     and a 2400 baud modem.  I would make the world safe for serious
     computer conferencers, info-freaks, and netmailers!  No more being
     stuck on busy waiting for your chance to download racy gifs and play
     stupid games!  Nossir; our town was going to move into the Future!

         Fortunately, I called my friend in Burnaby before I started
     anything serious.  He straightened me up well; dissuaded me from the
     instant BBS software to Max/Bink/Squish.  Sent me copies, and then
     even made a trip up (it was Spring - time for head-cleaning
     roadtrips), bringing along a 2 meg 386 MB, and we gutted the Zenith.
     We cobbled together a box which I'm still using lo these 5 or 6 years
     later, consulted the nodelist,
     and netmailed off a node number application. Last week I cudn't spell
     sisop, and now I _are_ one!  The beginning of my descent into hell.

                            "DOUGHBOY DIES"

     Veteran Pillsbury spokesman Pop N. Fresh died yesterday of a severe
     yeast infection.

     He was 71. Fresh was buried in one of the largest funeral ceremonies
     in recent years.

     Dozens of celebrities turned out incuding Mrs. Butterworth, The
     California Raisins, Hungry Jack, Betty Crocker, And the Hostess
     Twinkies. The graveside was piled high with flours as longtime friend
     Aunt Jemima delivered the eulogy, describing Fresh as a man who "never
     knew how much he was kneaded."

     Fresh rose quickly in show business, but his later life was filled
     with many turnovers. He was not considered a very smart cookie,
     wasting much of his dough on half baked schemes.

     Still, even as a crusty old man, he was a roll model for millions.
     Fresh is survived by his second wife. They have two children and one
     in the oven.

     The funeral will be tomorrow at 4:50 for about 20 minutes.
