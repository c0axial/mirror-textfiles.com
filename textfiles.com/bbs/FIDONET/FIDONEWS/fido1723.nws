                            An Apocalyptic Vision
                                by Doug Myers

     In the year 2525
     If Fido's still alive
     If sysops can survive
     If not, we'll contrive...

     In the days when humanity still controlled things, Fidonet was an
     attempt to bring order out of the primordial cyber-chaos before Al
     Gore created the ubiquitious internet in six days and six nights.
     But mankind never left go of old traditions, and held onto Fidonet
     even unto the seventh day.

     Even after the users departed Fidonet for the vaster Internet, the
     ancient system operators continued to poll in the old ways, so dear
     and familiar.  As the system operators aged and became infirm, their
     once mighty machines continued to poll in an automated manner,
     keeping the ancient network active.  Even after the mighty machines
     turned to dust, the patterns of polling which had spanned the
     Internet remained in digital memory, and the maintenance programs
     which kept the Internet in repair created routines to keep the
     ancient Fidonet operating in it's traditional fashion.

     Ironically, Fidonet 2525 exists on the vast internet in isolation,
     due mainly to the predominance of two of the early algorithms
     governing the Fidonet routine.  Mightiest of these algorithms is the
     Vested Interest, formed to continue the patterns of a human named
     Vest.  This algorithm established the principle that Fidonet was
     superior to the Internet because the Disturbing Influences were
     restricted from the moderated conferences.  Another ancient named
     Jared designed filters to prevent spam, and the algorithm named the
     Jared Juxtiposition reinforces the Vested Interest in such a manner
     that no human has since infiltrated Fidonet to disturb the ancient
     patterns.

     Though humanity has been effectively barred from Fidonet 2525, the
     ancients who once walked the halls of Fidonet have given birth to
     the many routines which still maintain this network in the old ways.
     Amoung the more notable routines:

     The Souvestre Syndrome - This algorithm controls the distribution of
     echoes which characterize Fidonet 2525.  In the beginning, echo
     distribution was influenced mightily by a different algorithm, the
     Peace Plan, which, unfortunately, only allowed for the creation of
     echoes and not their obliteration.  The Souvestre Syndrome decreed
     the expunging of empty echoes to compensate for the uncontrollable
     growth possible under the Peace Plan.  With humanity excluded from
     Fidonet 2525, empty echoes happen with certain regularity.  To
     adjust for this situation, the Souvestre Syndrome abandons it's
     FIDONEWS 17-23               Page 2                    5 Jun 2000


     current backbone distribution periodically, allowing it to be run by
     some of the many conflicting routines such as the Seaborn Shuffle,
     and then forming a new backbone.  The ensuing arguements ensure that
     echoes are refilled.

     The Darrell Dichotomy - Periodically decrees that all algorithms
     forming Fidonet are invalid because they weren't written by the
     original sysops who formed Fidonet.  Though the decree sends
     repercussions throughout the routine, the algorithms are never
     completely dissolved because no search engine can find the remnants
     of all the original sysops.

     The Cassell Constraints - Ensures that the "Good Ol' Boys"
     collection of algorithms no longer controls Fidonet.  Sets up a
     condition where these processes are periodically renamed but do the
     same ol' routines.

     The Myers Melange - Doomed to report the news in a Fidonet 2525
     where nothing ever changes, nonetheless this algorithm generates an
     unending string of conflicting opinion and limitless supply of ASCII
     cow cartoons on a regular basis.

     Can this go ten thousand years?
     Can we shed a million tears?
     For what we never knew,
     Ending in the bottom of a cyber lagoon...

     GREAT TRUTHS ABOUT LIFE THAT ADULTS HAVE LEARNED:

     1) Raising teenagers is like nailing Jell-O to a tree.
     2) There is always a lot to be thankful for, if you take the time to
         look.  For example, I'm sitting here thinking how nice it is  that
         wrinkles don't hurt.
     3) One reason to smile is that every seven minutes of everyday,
         someone in an aerobics class pulls a hamstring.
     4) Car sickness is the feeling you get when the monthly payment is
         due.
     5) The best way to keep kids at home is to make a pleasant atmosphere
         and let the air out of their tires.
     6) Families are like fudge . . . mostly sweet, with a few nuts.
     7) Today's mighty oak is just yesterday's nut that held its ground.
     8) Laughing helps. It's like jogging on the inside.
     9) Middle age is when you choose your cereal for the fiber, not the
         toy.

     11) If you can, remain calm, you just don't have all the facts.
     12) If your kids never come home except to eat, you are a great cook.

     GREAT TRUTHS ABOUT GROWING OLD

     1) Growing old is mandatory; growing up is optional.
     2) Insanity is my only means of relaxation.
     3) Forget the health food. I need all the preservatives I can get.
     4) You know you're getting old when you stoop to tie your shoes and
          wonder what else you can do while you're down there.
     5) You're getting old when you get the same sensation from a rocking
         chair what you once got from a roller coaster.
     6) Perhaps you know why women over fifty don't have babies: They
         would put them down somewhere and forget where they left them.
     7) One of life's mysteries is how a two pound box of candy can make a
         person gain five pounds.
     8) Every time I think about exercise, I lie down til the thought goes
         away.
     9) God put me on earth to accomplish a certain number of things. Right
         now, I am so far behind, I will live forever.
     10) It's frustrating when you know all the answers, but nobody bothers
            to ask you the questions.
     11) I finally got my head together, and my body fell apart.
     12) There cannot be a crisis this week; my schedule is already full.
     13) Time may be a great healer, but it's also a lousy beautician.
     14) The older you get, the tougher it is to lose weight, because by
            then your body and your fat are really good friends.
     15) Age doesn't always bring wisdom. Sometimes age comes alone.
     16) Just when I was getting used to yesterday, along came today.
     17) Sometimes I think I understand everything, then I regain
            consciousness.
     18) Amazing! You just hang something in your closet for a while, and
           it shrinks two sizes.
     19) It is bad to suppress laughter; it goes back down and spreads to
            your hips.
     20) Freedom of the press means no-iron clothes.
     21) Inside some of us is a thin person struggling to get out, but
            they can usually be sedated with a few pieces of chocolate
            cake.


     THE FOUR STAGES OF LIFE:
       1) You believe in Santa Claus.
       2) You don't believe in Santa Claus.
       3) You are Santa Claus.
       4) You look like Santa Claus.

                This weeks page is the KloneZone Mac BBS page.

     Where? http://kz.eaze.net/

                                What's it got?

     Well... It's a "Mac". :-)

     Seriously...  Some of us tend to forget that there are computers
     other than the IBM clones and compatibles out in BBS land. This
     writer went from a Coleco Adam system direct to an IBM and on from
     there. Since I know less than nothing about the Macintosh systems,
     I'll let the page do the talking. Drop by and look this site over.

     The KloneZone Mac was established in Nov 1992 to support the users
     of Apple II, Macintosh, Newton and Power PC as well as
     MS-DOS/Windows, Unix, and other computer platforms. At the time of
     its inception, the system operated on a Macintosh II with 8 MB of
     RAM and 230 MB of disk storage.

     Networking was always a feature of the KloneZone Mac , beginning
     with Fidonet echomail and news as provided by TabbyNet software, and
     moving to Mackennel when the Fidonet load outgrew the limits of the
     Tabby software.

     About 6 years ago, the KloneZone Mac was migrated to a Power
     Macintosh 8100/80 because the original system suffered damage in an
     electrical storm, even though the power and phone lines were
     disconnected, and a pair of surge protectors were connected to the
     CPU. (The lightning strike was close enough to be felt by the
     administrator, and it scrambled other electronics as well as totally
     destroyed the admin's home theatre system receiver, a cordless
     phone, and a VCR.)

     The system storage has grown too, with 152 megabytes of RAM, several
     gigabytes of hard disk storage, and 5 CD ROMs to replace the single
     CD ROM purchased second hand along with the TeleFinder BBS software.
     TeleFinder was always used on this system because of its ease of
     installation and maintenance, as well as its ease of use to the
     systems callers.

     The KloneZone Mac currently has an array of over 600 message areas
     with local, state-wide, regional, national and international
     distribution cover technical, recreation, political, education, and
     business-related themes. Networking capabilities now in the
     TeleFinder servers and companion add-in software allow the system to
     include several hundred UseNet newsgroups, continuous Internet
     Email, TeleFinder Network (TFNet) message areas and Email, as well
     as personal web pages and 318 Fidonet message areas.

     Items of interest to virtually anyone can be found online. Access to
     networked feeds supporting Commodore-Amiga, Apple II, Macintosh,
     CP/M, DOS, Windows, OS/2, and Unix are online.

     The system is now in a rebuilding process because ALL recent files
     (programs, configuration data, user mail and web pages, system and
     personal files) were lost in a hard disk failure with no chance of
     recovery. (The most current backup was largely unreadable, but and
     FIDONEWS 17-23               Page 6                    5 Jun 2000


     older one was restored) The new pages reflect the administrator's
     efforts to get things back on track.

     =================================================================


     25 THINGS YOU WILL LEARN IN 50 YEARS OF LIVING

     1. The badness of a movie is directly proportional to the number of
        helicopters in it.

     2. You will never find anybody who can give you a clear and
        compelling reason why we observe "Daylight Saving Time."

     3. People who feel the need to tell you that they have an excellent
        sense of humor are telling you that they have no sense of humor.

     4. The most valuable function performed by the federal government is
        entertainment.

     5. You should never say anything to a woman that even remotely
        suggests you think she's pregnant unless you can see an actual
        baby emerging from her at that moment.

     6. A penny saved is worthless.

     7. They can hold all the peace talks they want, but there will never
        be peace in the Middle East. Billions of years from now, when
        Earth is hurtling toward the Sun and there is nothing left alive
        on the planet except a few microorganisms, the microorganisms
        living in the Middle East will be bitter enemies.

     8. The most powerful force in the universe is: gossip.

     9. The one thing that unites all human beings, regardless of age,
        gender, religion, economic status, or ethnic background, is that,
        deep down inside, we all believe that we are above-average
        drivers.

     10. There comes a time when you should stop expecting other people
         to make a big deal about your birthday. That time is: age 11.

     11. There is a very fine line between "hobby" and "mental illness."

     12. People who want to share their religious views with you almost
         never want you to share yours with them.

     13. There apparently exists, somewhere in Los Angeles, a computer
         that generates concepts for television sitcoms. When TV
         executives need a new concept, they turn on this computer; after
         sorting through millions of possible plot premises, it spits
         out, "THREE QUIRKY BUT ATTRACTIVE YOUNG PEOPLE LIVING IN AN
         APARTMENT," and the executives turn this concept into a show.
         The next time they need an idea, the computer spits out, "SIX
         QUIRKY BUT ATTRACTIVE YOUNG PEOPLE LIVING IN AN APARTMENT." Then
         the next time, it spits out, "FOUR QUIRKY BUT ATTRACTIVE YOUNG
         PEOPLE LIVING IN AN APARTMENT." And so on. We need to locate
     FIDONEWS 17-23               Page 8                    5 Jun 2000


         this computer and destroy it with hammers.

     14. Nobody is normal.

     15. At least once per year, some group of scientists will become
         very excited and announce that:
         - The universe is even bigger than they thought!
         - There are even more subatomic particles than they thought!
         - Whatever they announced last year about global warming is wrong.

     16. If you had to identify, in one word, the reason why the human
         race has not achieved, and never will achieve, its full
         potential, that word would be: "meetings."

     17. The main accomplishment of almost all organized protests is to
         annoy people who are not in them.

     18. The value of advertising is that it tells you the exact opposite
         of what the advertiser actually thinks. For example:

         - If the advertisement says "This is not your father's
           Oldsmobile," the advertiser is desperately concerned that this
           Oldsmobile, like all other Oldsmobiles, appeals primarily to
           old farts like your father.

         - If Coke and Pepsi spend billions of dollars to convince you
           that there are significant differences between these two
           products, both companies realize that Pepsi and Coke are
           virtually identical.

         - If an advertisement shows a group of cool, attractive
           youngsters getting excited and high-fiving each other because
           the refrigerator contains Sunny Delight,the advertiser knows
           that any real youngster who reacted in this way to this
           beverage would be considered by his peers to be the world's
           biggest dip----.

         - And so on those rare occasions when advertising dares to poke
           fun at the product-as in the classic Volkswagen Beetle
           campaign-it's because the advertiser actually thinks the
           product is pretty good. If a politician ever ran for president
           under a slogan such as "Harlan Frubert:Basically, He Wants
           Attention," I would quit my job to work for his campaign.

     19. If there really is a God who created the entire universe with
         all of its glories, and He decides to deliver a message to
         humanity, He will not use, as His messenger, a person on cable
         TV with a bad hairstyle.

     20. You should not confuse your career with your life.

     21. A person who is nice to you, but rude to the waiter, is not a
         nice person.

     22. No matter what happens, somebody will find a way to take it too
         seriously.

     23. When trouble arises and things look bad, there is always one
         individual who perceives a solution and is willing to take
         command. Very often, that individual is crazy.

     24. Your friends love you anyway.

     25. Nobody cares if you can't dance well. Just get up and dance.

     a @ preceding an individual's name implies a virtual email
     address. The email is translated as follows
     firstlast@osirusoft.com will automatically route to the
     appropriate individual's email.  Anyone in this list will
     also receive routed notice of this feature.  In my case, it
     would still be joejared@osirusoft.com, but you get the idea.

     Also, as information is provided to me, I will be adding a
     latency field to each node, which is defined as the maximum
     time between when the message is received, and when it is
     sent on to other nodes, or available to be sent onward,
     defined in minutes. A latency of ! implies that there is an
     immediate response, and an attempt to deliver immediately
