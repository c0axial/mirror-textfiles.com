Editorial: The illegible leading the illiterate

by Tom Jennings (1:1/1)

Here we are again in FidoNet-land. Every turned rock uncovers an
LSD-like infinitely recursive spiral of complaint, counter-complaint and
endless self-reference and iteration. Gigajoules of energy spent in
avoiding a weekend's writing project.

Yes, we're talking once again about "FidoNews article policy". Don't
worry, it will all be over soon. To sum up the arguments, it's like this
-- If only the editor would eliminate the "non-FidoNet related"
articles, the newsletter would become meaningful "again". (Was it
ever?!)

Fact is, FidoNews simply doesn't receive many article submissions. I
mean, it's not like I'm bumping crucial articles on the work of the
FTSC, or an analysis of multi-protocol modem connect sequences, or
multi-line BBS/mailer software, the technical difficulties of
zonegating, or such like, in exchange for ASCII drawings of
rock'n'rollers dead of their own stupidity or blinking dogs or angels on
the head of a pin and other dreck. If you don't see interesting
articles, don't blame the messenger. (That's me.)

And hey, I'm patient --

Again, I suggest that those displeased with the contents herein consider
writing the articles they'd like to see, or encourage those with
interesting stories to write them. I'll give encouragement and hints
from afar.

Complaining is far too easy, and I can tell you I've heard them all now.
Thanks. I won't be addressing this end of things again, unless I get
truly original suggestions or complaints. Thank you!


BY THE WAY -- has anyone noticed that my latest suggestion would
eliminate the endless series of articles in the following categories:

        A new & improved 'policy'
        A new & improved 'nodelist'
        Christian vs. non-christian
        ...

I'm not sure what's left.

!!! _WARNING_: "Bill to third member calls" and modem lines !!!

/* This applies to the North American telephone system only --tomj */


Dear fellow sysops:

       Because of the nature of long distance carriers and modem lines,
there is a big loophole in the phone system that makes it possible for
people to bill their long distance calls to your modem line. Quoted
from the Framingham/Natick (508) Nynex Yellow Pages, page 37:

                Bill to Third Number Calls
                --------------------------
        You may have charges billed to a third telephone
        number if that telephone is not a public pay phone.
        If you are calling from a pay phone, the Operator may call the
        third number and confirm that the charges will be accepted. If
        there is no confirmation, you may make other billing
        arrangements such as paying the coin rate, using your Calling
        Card or calling collect.

HOW IT IS DONE:
---------------
        The loophole lies in the fact that often, the operator will
not place the confirmation call. Instead, an electronic operator will
do so. If you've ever made a Bill to third number call or a collect
call and you've gotten the electronic operator, you know what I mean.
Basically, the electronic operator is a "voice-mail" like voice menu
that has a recording feature and some fancy vocal string recognition
hardware/software. A typical electronic operator collect call goes
like this (the bill to third number calls are basically the same):

[Dial: 0-xxx-xxx-xxxx]
EO: "Welcome to AT&T Operator assistance. If you are calling from a
touch tone phone, press 1 for Collect calls, press 2 for
Person-To-Person calls, press 3 for Bill to a Third Number
Calls....(etc.)"
[Person presses the appropriate menu selection]
EO: "Please say your name now."
[Person says his name]
EO: "Please Wait."
[EO dials the number for confirmation]
[Person or Modem or whatever answers]
EO: "Hello. This is an AT&T collect call from..."[EO plays back the
persons name] "Press 1 or say 'YES' now to accept the charges:"

FidoNews 8-40                  Page 5                       7 Oct 1991


        The fault is HERE!!! How does a stupid computer tell the
difference between a 'YES', a '1', a modem start tone, and anything
else??? Well, I once placed a collect call and got the EO. When the
number was dialed, the EO got an answering machine and the answering
machine's message was not interpreted as a "YES". But what about a
modem start tone??? It could be interpreted as a 1 or as a "YES".

        The result is that someone makes his long distance phone call
and it gets billed to your number because your modem gave a start
tone.

HOW TO RECOGNIZE WHEN IT HAPPENS TO YOU:
----------------------------------------

        The phone number that the call was made from and the number
called will both appear on your monthly phone bill. Unfortunately, it
is very inconspicuous and it can be easily missed when you quickly
glance at your month's echomail charges. It looks like this:
(taken directly from my AT&T phone bill this month)

NEW CHARGES
> Calling Services
* ITEMIZED CALLS

No.     Date    Time    Place         Area-Number  *  Min:Sec  Amount
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.      Aug 7  238PM   Framingham MA 508-xxx-xxxx DS    1      1.97
                  FROM Terrehaute IN 812-xxx-xxxx
2.      Aug 7  239PM   Framingham MA 508-xxx-xxxx DS    8      3.54
                  FROM Terrehaute IN 812-xxx-xxxx

Notice the words "Bill to third number" never appear on the bill.
Very easy to miss with all the other calls on the page. The 508 number
is where the person in Terrehaute, IN called when he/she billed the
call to my number. Luckily, the two numbers appear on your bill so it
can be traced. I looked through both my users.bbs and the fidonet
nodelist and none of the above numbers are in either file.
Add in the taxes and these two fradulant calls cost me $5.96.

All I can say to the person who did this is:
"Thanks for using S-R-R-T!" :-) (SRRT is the name of my BBS.)

WHAT TO DO IF IT HAPPENS TO YOU:
--------------------------------

        If it appears on your local carrier's bill, call your local
carrier. If it appears on your long distance carrier's bill, call your
long distance carrier. Give them your phone number and tell them the
time and date of the call(s) in question. Give them a minute to pull
up a copy of your bill on their screen. Explain to them that your line
is a modem line and a computer modem will answer the phone, never a human
being. Ask for credit. They should give it to you without any
questions. They will investigate the other two numbers and get to the
bottom of the story.

HOW TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING:
-----------------------------------
        Not much can be done to PREVENT it from happening. There is
basically only one service the phone company can give that will
prevent this from happening. It is called "Third Number Block". New
England Telephone charges 98 cents a month plus the one time
installation fee (around $11) to do this. IF you do this, it will
block these third party calls.
        If you feel that you shouldn't have to pay money to the phone
company for this service (like me), there is only one other course of
action - review the phone bill every month and dispute questionable
calls.

LEGAL MATTERS:
--------------
        From page 23 of the Framingham/Natick (508) yellow pages:

        " FRAUDULENT CALLERS ARE SUBJECT TO PROSECUTION:
        -------------------------------------------------
        It is illegal for another person to charge any telephone
        services or long distance calls to your number or New England
        Telephone Calling Card without your permission or to tamper
        with the facilities or equipment to avoid or alter authorized
        charges. Persons placing such calls are subject to
        prosecution. In Massachusetts, those convicted are subject to
        imprisonment for up to 30 days or a fine of up to $100 or
        both. "

'Nuff said!!!!

A LETTER TO THE EDITORS OF FIDONEWS

by Bill Bolton (3:711/403)


One issue which I believe that your recent editorial on Fidonews
contents has somewhat overlooked is the priveleged position of
Fidonews within Fidonet... ie. the *C structure is required to make it
available to the net at large, all over the world, whether it is
relevant or not.

While as a general principle I have long supported the idea that there
should be little restriction on the topics covered of Fidonews, this
"open" publication policy has resulted in numerous recent issues
having virtually no worthwhile content at all for anyone outside of
North America (and arguably little worthwhile content for those inside
North America).
FidoNews 8-40                  Page 7                       7 Oct 1991


Your recent, though temporary, decision to limit contributions to
matters generally related to Fidonet and small systems communications
seems to me to be one possible solution to the international relevance
issue, as it is quite difficult to write anything about Fidonet or
small systems comms that isn't going to have some international
relevance, even if it's not relevant everywhere.

Basically I believe that if Fidonews is to retain is priveleged
position in Fidonet as far as automatic distribution is concerned, it
needs to ensure that it does not loose its relevance to the net, and
as such it is probably not practical to maintain a completely "wide
open" editorial policy as far as topics are concerned.

Cheers,

Bill Bolton

/* Bill -- please see my editorial regarding content and "non-FidoNet
related" articles.

And I would absolutely love to see non-U.S. stuff in FidoNews! Hey, I
may be a tacky American, but I am not a provincial. From the start
(well, OK, very soon thereafter, 1985) I have been careful to keep
Americentrism out of FidoNet -- technically and socially. For example, I
was under a lot of pressure to use "country" instead of zone, "state"
for region, and use U.S. telco addressing as node numbers. Needless to
say, it would have been disaster. These were not the only events.

It is not my job to do this. The authors themselves need to keep in mind
that their zone/country/etc is not the same as everyone elses. It is
very common here in the U.S. -- as elsewhere -- to assume that everyone
lives like us. (In warehouses consisting of 8 - 10 people not including
extended families and communities with shared resources like vehicles,
recycling, composting, free boxes, etc... that's how we all live in the
U.S, right?! Or is that just my house. Sometimes I forget. :-)

And besides, the "non-FidoNet related" content of FidoNews is barely
10% of an issue on an average day. And you can be sure that if I
removed all "non-FidoNet related" articles, I'd get complaints about
the next level down of "too many nodelist articles" and "too many policy
articles".  (See my editorial in this issue.)

     '"Getting together" is part of Scouting. To do
     so via computer is truly an unusual method, but
     helps to show that Scouting is in the
     forefront. This is a Movement, and this
     activity reinforces that we should always look
     to move forward, not lag behind. As Baden-
     Powell said, we should "Look Wide."

     Enjoy your Conference, and may many new
     Scouting friendships spring from it.'

So went the message from Maurice Law, Chief Scout Commissioner
of Queensland, Australia, which effectively opened the recent
International Scout Computer Conference. But this was a
message with a difference - this was not a message addressed
face to face with a room full of people - this was a message
entered into a computer in Cairns, Far North Queensland,
Australia. Within twenty five minutes, the Chief's message was
being read by Scouts in Brisbane Qld, Aust., Camden NSW,
Aust., Canberra ACT, Aust., California USA, the North West
Territories of Canada (just below the Arctic circle) and in
Surrey, England.

For some years now, Scouting has been taking advantage of an
echo for Leaders, called SCOUTER. Originally, it was used by a
few American Leaders for passing information, arranging camps,
swapping yarns, campfire stunts and games, arranging badge-
swapping and so on.

FidoNews 8-40                  Page 9                       7 Oct 1991


Then Canada joined in, with a Leader in one of the most remote
parts of the world able to get information from his American
brothers within hours. The UK swiftly followed, and now
Australia is in there too, with a strong possibility that
Brazil and New Zealand, amongst others, will be in shortly.

But this was mainly for Leaders. What about the kids?
Australia came up with idea of having an International hook-up
for anyone who wanted to join in. So, on August 4th, 1991,, at
the ridiculous hour of 6:00am in Australia, the first ever
International Scout Computer Conference commenced with Maurice
Law's message being read to the Scouts in Canberra. Sleepy
Venturer Scouts in Cairns, excited Scouts and Guides in
Brisbane, Camden and Canberra, Cub Scouts in Surrey, and
members of the Boy Scouts of America, and Scouts of Canada
eagerly awaited the first parcel of messages from elsewhere.

And so for over four hours, messages flew from every country,
bringing to kids around the world a new experience. During the
period, some 442 messages were generated and transmitted.
Scouts learned about Scouting in other countries, and how
their brother Scouts (or sister Guides) live. Of course, there
were a few that didn't really get the hang of it too quickly,
but the quality of the messages was generally of an extremely
high standard.

The youngest participant in the Conference was six years old
(unless you count the cat that sent a message at one stage!)
while the oldest of the Youth members was probably only 18.
The adult sysops and points stayed out of the proceddings as
much as possible, and it is amazing how quickly absolute
beginners can learn Msged etc.

By the end of the Conference, England reported that there were
Cub Scouts fast asleep all over the room (it was after 1:00 am
there) and the Australians had the rest of the day to recover,
while the Americans and Canadians could go and have dinner.
Time differences are wonderful things.....

Did we enjoy the Conference, as Maurice asked us to? You bet!
Even now, messages are arriving to and from various
participants, continuing conversations started on August 4th.

Would we do it again? You bet! Any other Scout or Guide
Leaders out there want to join us, either in the SCOUTER echo
or in a future event? Here are the contacts you can get in
touch with -

                  IN DEFENSE OF THE ST. LOUIS FORMAT
                        (Amoung other things)

     There's been much talk recently about how large the distribution
NodeList has become.  So much, in fact, that some people are
suggesting that we convert to a new and shorter format.  Is it really
necessary?  Converting to a new format would certainly alienate a
large portion of the non-MSDos systems out there (me included) while
they patiently wait for someone to write a new NodeList processor for
their environment.  How would you be able to implement it over the
current distribution system?  Pick an (arbitrary) day where 11,000+
systems would have to call around and get a 700k+ file?  I think
there'd be a few phone systems that would overload from the stress.

     Why, then, has the NodeList grown so much?  Simple: Net (and
Regional) Coordinators who couldn't care less.  Has anybody ever
questioned why there are over 500 unpublished systems in the Nodelist?
Perhaps a large portion of these should be points, not private nodes?
Has anyone ever looked at the flags usage explanation at the bottom of
the Nodelist?  It states that V42bis implies V42 and V32bis implies
V32, and that use of both flags is redundant.  Why is it that almost
every V32/V42 system is listed with all FOUR flags?

     Recently an attitude of "Well, as long as I'm getting my Echoes"
seems to have permeated FidoNet.  During the last week over 500
crippled messages were received at my node.  All of them originated
outside my region and passed through at least two backbone stars (and
quite a few regional hubs).  No one seemed too concerned about it.

     What I'm getting at is there needs to be some form of checking
and consiatancy across the network.  RC's (and NC's) need to check the
information they're submitting, rather than just forwarding it along.
If it's not correct, try sending it back!  The elimination of the
aforementioned problems in the Nodelist should shorten it by 30% at a
minimum.

FidoNews 8-40                  Page 11                      7 Oct 1991


     We're all in this together.  I enjoy FidoNet, and I'm concerned
about it's well-being.  Doesn't anybody else really care anymore?

                       FIDONET IS SCREWED UP

This is probably my longest article on the Snooze so far, and
it's NOT good news. I've been putting it off for AGES, but I
guess there comes a time to just sit and type truths. If it does
get censored -which I doubt from TJ but you never know in the
times of George Bush President of the World- I will scream quite
loud.

I won't be novel, fresh or innovative. Just plain sincere and
outspoken. I know that those who some of us call the network's
"politburo" (that definitely ain't in Region 2:50 but in "normal,
English-speaking communities of the free world") will cry "war,"
but I really don't give a... screw... oops! I'm damn tired, it's
time to talk.

Some things have been occurring in our network recently. Cries
against a suspected "commercialization" of our hobbyist-amateur
community, the collapse of an important number the inter-zone
echomail links now submerged into chaos as they say, after Felix
Kasza's departure, though slowly restablishing.

This is the second time I witness a European Zone Coordinator
disappointingly resigning in a turmoil. The first time it
happened with Ron Dwight who finally left disgusted with "our"
International Coordinator & Co.'s indeed disgusting political
tactics. Now it's Felix, obviously burnt out after having to take
so much shit from so many folks.

Many other interesting and quite positive individuals in our
electronic community, especially those involved with bringing
that much-needed change and progress have already left us. People
like Felix Kasza and Bor-Long Lin are real losses to FidoNet. And
I don't necessarily agree with either of them or the many others
that left. But the fact that the "politburo" didn't agree with
them either, expedited their adios. This is BAD.

Gee... what really pisses me off is that while these people leave
upset, the same old farts keep up with their stupid power trips
in FidoNet. There are far too many of them, and it is far too bad
for most of the thousands of members of the world's biggest BBS
network.

I don't know if there is anyone trying to "commercialize"
FidoNet, like some have been claiming recently. As long as they
do it legitimately and with us knowing what's happening, it's
okay. I hate to see people howling nonsense just to prevent
change from happening.


Those that submitted proposals to reduce the nodelist's size: do
you think you are even paid attention to? Ask me, I know you're
just talking to walls. What about us working in having the
ridiculous and truly nauseating Policy4 replaced? I doubt under
current circumstances we'll arrive to good port. There is an
echomail conference adequately called NET_DEV. Yet the head of
the FTSC refuses to read it... bienvenido progreso!

Political games in FidoNet are something big and certainly vile.
I've witnessed far too many, from the times of the IFNA
dissolution, to more recently, at the end of the failed WorldPol
vote or even last week.

During my early days of being Latin American zone coordinator, I
was once invited to one of the monthly Zone-1 RC and ZC
teleconferences. Boy I was impressed. I was a Latin American in
the US, feeling like a Swiss in Banana Republic. It wasn't
anything in special, but just the planning, the manipulation...
simply astounding. They referred to a coupla thousand computer
geeks as if they were a few million peasants to be controlled and
exploited... They behaved like an Interest Group, and not of the
CompuServe type.

During my last days of being Latin American zone coordinator, I
witnessed one of the most horrendous political moves I ever saw
happening in FidoNet: the US end of the zonegate, that also
forwards inbound mail to Zone-4 coming from Zones 3, 5 and 6,
imposed a 24-day-long "embargo" on all mail deliveries. Yes,
folks, that's how it happened. This was throughout last May and
still today neither George Peace or Randy Bush himself haven't
said a word about it.

We survived the "embargo" with an emergency link setup with Zone-
2. All mail bound for the rest of the network we could route
through Europe. Otherwise, all out mail to most of the world was
literally stuck and we didn't even know the reason for that.

After the "embargo," I promised the worried folks in Zone-4 I
would offer myself to act as zonegate to them when I moved here.
You know this means spending big bucks on international calls,
etc., and some down there were even willing to collaborate with
the expenses, all for the sake of a reliable official link to
North America. I did carry out my promise, but the Zone-1
coordinator judged it "politically and technically" better to
continue having the current you-now-know-why unreliable link. You
tell me whassup...

FidoNews 8-40                  Page 13                      7 Oct 1991


While some extremely ignorant "officers" of our network like the
current Aussie zone coordinator even got to the point of calling
me a "nazi in hiding in South America" -when in fact most of my
family then in Europe never made it safe out of Warsaw- Zone-4
Latin America is indeed the only true democratic Zone in FidoNet,
where all coordinators are elected by direct, popular vote.


When will we sysops in other zones enjoy that same benefit we
take for granted in our normal lives? When will the crowd of old
farts decide to quit warming up their coordinator seats and let
the members of this network choose? When will political games in
FidoNet, occurring every day in proportions beyond the limits of
our imagination stop or at least decrease in frequency?

All these questions I can't answer. But I hope that every little
self in ourselves starts to act and get involved to end this
situation. If just a small number of us take care of handling
this enormous task, it is more likely that we will fail again.

Please let's do something to prevent more productive people from
frustratingly leaving FidoNet. I, like many others, have put tons
of personal energy to see this network grow big and I'm weary of
seeing this electronic mob ruin it all. Let's get the old farts
of the politburo out, once and for all. We seriously need direct
elections for Net, Region and Zone Coordinator.

               My opinions on the Nodelist debate

In the last few issues of the `Snooze' there has been much
discussion over the size of the current Nodelist, which has
recently broken the one megabyte barrier.  While I am only a
PointOp, I do maintain a full Nodelist and I have watched it grow
from 9000 nodes a year ago to more than 13300 nodes in
Nodelist.277, clearly something must be done.

There have been many proposals in the past few issues, but each
proposal seems to be forgetting one important detail.  If we
change the structure of the Nodelist, then EVERY single mailer,
tosser, BBS, and Nodelist utility would have to be completely re-
written.  This might not be possible for some of the older
orphaned computers that are happily running a node somewhere with
little or no programmer support.

FidoNews 8-40                  Page 14                      7 Oct 1991


While not a solution, the proposal to split the Nodelist by zone
has merit because it could be made to work with existing software.
This could act as a stopgap measure for several years until new
software could be written to support a new Nodelist format.

If we are going to take all the time and headaches to change the
structure of the Nodelist, then lets come up with some form of
BINARY Nodelist that presents the maximum amount of information in
the least amount of bytes.  If we are going to scrap all existing
software, lets make sure that whatever form the new Nodelist takes
will last for many years to come.  Lets go through this only once.

      Development Manager: Will Schlichtman (1:350/59.0@fidonet)

Last week we began the release of Version 3.2 of the Fort Worth Nodelist
format.  The first section covered an overview of the format, including
general line entry definitions.  This week we go into detail defining
what each field means and valid information used in those fields.  We
also cover the tricky dialing translation information.  And, at the
end, we provide a sample net nodelist entry.

  2.4 Field Definitions
  ---------------------

  z_num --
      Defines the Zone number of a large geographic Zone.  Valid values
      are any integer between 1 and 32767 inclusive.  Each Zone number
      MUST be unique to a nodelist and may NOT be repeated.

  r_num --
      Defines the Region number of a geographic Region.  Valid values are
      any integer between 1 and 32767 inclusive.  Each Region number MUST
      be unique to a Zone and may NOT be repeated.  No Region number may
      be the same as the Zone number.

  n_num --
      Defines the Net number of a local area Network.  Valid values are
      any integer between 1 and 32767 inclusive.  Each Net number MUST be
FidoNews 8-40                  Page 15                      7 Oct 1991


      unique to a Zone and may NOT be repeated.  No Net number may be
      the same as the Zone number or Region number.

  h_num --
      Defines the Hub number of a mail-routing hub of a local area Net.
      Valid values are any integer between 1 and 32767.  Each Hub number
      MUST be unique to a Net and may NOT be repeated, either as an Hub
      number or as an individual node number (defined below).

  num --
      Defines the individual node number of a single system in a local
      area Net, as well as individual node numbers of Zone Service Nodes
      and Regional Independant Nodes.  Valid values are any integer
      between 1 and 32767.  Each node number MUST be unique to a Net
      (Zone, or Region, as appropriate) and may NOT be repeated, either as
      a Hub number or as an individual node number.

  area --
      Geographic area of administration which a Zone, Region, or Net
      covers.  Maximum field length is twenty (20) characters.  Valid
      values are any alphanumeric characters except the space ( ), which
      is represented by the underscore (_) character.

  sysop --
      Defines the name of the person responsible for the conduct of an
      individual node.  Valid values are any alphanumeric characters
      except the space ( ), which is represented by the underscore (_)
      character.

  ac --
      Defines the area code or other information that repeats from node to
      node, ommitted in normal node listings.  This is used in dialing
      translations.  See the section "Dialing Translations".

  fphone --
      Defines the entire phone number of a node, including area code or
      other information which repeats from node to node in a given area.

  phone --
      Defines the phone number of a node, not including area code or other
      information which repeats from node to node in a given area.

  bps --
      Defines the raw speed of the modem used by a node.  Valid
      values are:

           Flag     Means

            3       300 bps
            1       1200 bps
            2       2400 bps
FidoNews 8-40                  Page 16                      7 Oct 1991


            9       9600 bps
            4       14,400 bps
            0       19,200 bps
            8       38,400 bps

      Other flags may be added as technology becomes available.  It
      should be noted that at the time this document was written, no
      modem was able to communicate at a raw rate faster than 9,600
      bps, and so all such modems should be listed with the "9" flag.

  mdmflg --
      Defines any special protocols in use by a node's modem, such as
      error correction or data compression.  Flags are one or two bytes in
      length.  Valid values are:

           Flag     Means

           V2        CCITT V.21   300 bps full duplex
           22        CCITT V.22   1200 bps full duplex
           V9        CCITT V.29   9600 bps half duplex
           V3        CCITT V.32   9600 bps full duplex
           3B        CCITT V.32bis
           33        CCITT V.33
           34        CCITT V.34
           V4        CCITT V.42
           4B        CCITT V.42bis
           M         Microcom Network Protocol (MNP)
           H9        Hayes V9600
           H         USRobotics Courier HST
           MA        Microcom AX/96xx series
           P         Packet Ensemble Protocol (PEP)
           C         CompuCom Speed Modem

                 NOTE:  Many V22 modems also support Bell 212A.

            If no modem flag is given,  Bell 212A is assumed for 1200 bps
            systems,  CCITT V22bis is assumed for 2400 bps systems.

      A separate error correction flag should not be used when error
      correction type can be determined by the modem flag.  For instance,
      modem flags of H and C imply M,  3B implies V3, and 4B implies V4.

      Because modems can support multiple optional protocols more than one
      flag may be required.  For example, the USRobotics Courier Dual
      Standard with V.32bis and V.42bis requires three flags.  In such
      cases flags can be put together in one field, like so:
                            "...,9,H3B4B,..."

      Flags can be added as technology becomes available.

      If no flag is appropriate the field should be ommitted.

  ho --
      Defines the hours of operation of a given node.  Valid values can be
      in one of two formats or empty, determined as follows:
                                "...,,..."
                               "...,CM,..."
                            "...,HHMMhhmm,..."

      If a node accepts mail only during the Zone Mail Hour (ZMH) as
      defined in FTS-0001, this field should be left blank as in the first
      example above.

      Some software allows the capability to receive mail 24 hours a day.
      If such software is active on a given node, the CM (continuous mail)
      flag should be listed, as in the second example above.

      Sometimes a node accepts mail only during certain hours of the day
      outside of ZMH.  If this is the case, this field appears as follows:

      HH defines the hour, in 24-hour format calculated to Universal
         Coordinated Time (UTC), that a node begins accepting mail.
         Valid values are any integer between 00 and 23.
      MM defines the minute, in 24-hour format calculated to Universal
         Coordinated Time (UTC), that a node begins accepting mail.  Valid
         values are any integer between 00 and 59.
      hh defines the hour, in 24-hour format calculated to Universal
         Coordinated Time (UTC), that a node stops accepting mail.  Valid
         values are any integer between 00 and 23.
      mm defines the minute, in 24-hour format calculated to Universal
         Coordinated Time (UTC), that a node stops accepting mail.  Valid
         values are any integer between 00 and 59.

      Times may span midnight.  An example of a valid value of the third
      type is "...,23000600,...".  This means that the node in question
      accepts mail from 11:00 p.m. until 6:00 a.m.

  frq --
      Defines the type of file and/or update requests supported by a node,
      if any.  If no file/update requests are supported, this field is
      left blank, like so:
                                "...,,..."

      The flag used depends on the protocols supported by the given node,
      determined from the following chart:

              +---------------------+----------------------+
              |        BARK         |        WAZOO         |

         | G  |   No    |    No     |    Yes   |    Yes    |
         +----+---------+-----------+----------+-----------+

  opt --
      Defines any optional flags that convey additional information about
      a node that might be required by a mailer.  Policy dictates who
      decides what flags go in the nodelist, but the following flags are
      standard:

            Flag      Means

            MN        No compression supported
            Gx..x     Gateway to domain
            #xx       Node observes given mail hour
            Ux..x     User specified string

      Each flag MUST be separated by a comma (,).

      NOTES:
         MN - The only compression method standard in FidoNet is
            archiving, using the standard SEA ARC format, with archive
            names defined by the specification for ARCMail v0.6.  The
            absence of the MN flag indicates that ARCMail v0.6 compression
            is supported by this node.

         Gx..x - Gateway to domain 'x..x', where 'x..x' is a string of
            alphanumeric characters.  Valid values for 'x..x' are assigned
            by the FidoNet Internaional Coordinator, his designee, or as
            defined by policy.  Current valid values of 'x..x' may be
            found in the notes at the end of the FidoNet nodelist.

         #xx - When applicable,  the mail period flags may be strung
            together with no intervening commas,  eg. "#02#09".  Only
            mail hours other than that standard within a node's zone
            should be given.  Since observance of mail hour within
            one's zone is mandatory,  it should not be indicated.  To
            determine the digit to use the Zone number of the ZMH being
            observed is used.  For example, a node in Zone 4 observing
            mail hours of Zones 1, 2, 3, and 5 should be listed
            "...,#01#02#03#05,..."

         Ux..x - A user-specified string, which may contain any
            alphanumeric character except spaces ( ).  This string may
            contain one to twenty characters information that may be used
            to add user-defined data to a specific nodelist entry.  The
            FidoNet International Coordinator may define valid values for
FidoNews 8-40                  Page 19                      7 Oct 1991


            this field.

       FTSC recognizes that the FidoNet International Coordinator is the
       ultimate authority over what appears in the FidoNet nodelist. Also,
       FTSC is by definition a deliberative body,  and adding or changing
       a flag may take a considerable amount of time.  Therefore,  the
       FidoNet International Coordinator may temporarily make changes or
       additions to the flags as defined in this document.  The FidoNet
       International Coordinator will then consult with FTSC over the
       changes needed to this document to reflect these temporary changes.


  2.5 Dialing Translations:
  -------------------------

       Because normal nodes do not carry area codes or other repeating
       information (lumped into the heading "area codes") in their
       individual phone listings, a method must be implemented to handle
       this.  This is the function of the ac field in the Net listing.  It
       is used as follows, with the following nodelist lines used as
       an example.  They have been white-spaced to make them easier to
       read.  Normally no white space would appear in a listing!

    The "ac" field is added to the BEGINNING of each "phone" field,
    including that belonging to the NC, in a given nodelist until a
    static flag indicates otherwise.

    The "ac" field is NOT added to nodes carrying the "Z", "R", "S",
    "I", "O", "U", "P", or "D" flags.

    The "ac" field from the NC line is added to each line until a "U" or
    "N" flag is spotted, at which time the new "ac" field is read. The
    "U" ac field is then added to all nodes below it, until a new "U"
    flag or a new "N" flag is read.  If a "Z" or "R" flag is spotted the
    ac field is ignored until the occurance of another "N" flag.

    If an "O" flag is present, the current "ac" field is not added, but
    instead the entire phone number listed, with no translation, is
FidoNews 8-40                  Page 20                      7 Oct 1991


    used.  Adding the "ac" flag resumes on the next line, if no other
    flag is present.

    If a "U,NUL" set is present, there are only three fields, two of
    which are static.  The third field is the area code, and the line
    terminates with a CR/LF pair, as any other line in the nodelist.

    Using the above lines, we can see that the phone numbers for each of
    the above nodes are:

    100 1-213-555-9484
    101 1-213-555-1212
    102 1-213-000-0000
    103 1-817-999-2133
    104 1-214-555-2121
    105 1-214-555-3244
    106 1-512-999-9999

A suggestion for a Zone One Policy

While following the fracas on FN_SYSOP and ZEC this summer, which I'm
told was also in other fora, I grew frustrated with the arguments and
what seemed to be some clear differences which could not be resolved
without either some fundamental change or statement of policy.  Much
of the stir seemed to originate in the question of validity, both of
the B.O.P. and of the *EC structure itself.  May I suggest that this
validity needs to be established, preferably soon.

FidoNews 8-40                  Page 21                      7 Oct 1991


Therefore, I suggest that the Zone One *C structure enact a Zone One
Policy, recognizing the existence of the *EC structure and its
legitimacy in moving echomail.  Although I'm in neither the *C nor the
*EC hierarchies, I've taken the liberty of adulterating Policy4 to
prepare a rough draft of a document which could become such a policy.

After sending out an initial rough draft in August to my NC, NEC, RC,
REC, ZC, and ZEC, I met with few responses.  The only serious critique
was from George Peace, who said:  "Similar policy updates must then
offer that groupmail, file distribution, and other special interest
coordinators are part of the control structure. It's a can of worms
we're better off not opening."  With all due respect, Mr. Peace, I
disagree.  However, as a result of his response, I added a section
which allows for addenda which recognize other types of message and
file sharing.

I'm now up to a third draft, which our good editor has determined is
too long for publication here in FidoNews.  *Sigh*.  Well, the best I
can do now is make it available for f'req.  It's magic name is Z1POL
for the uncompressed file (about 17K) or Z1POLZIP, Z1POLARC, Z1POLARJ,
Z1POLLZH (ranging from 5K to 7K), magic names for various compressed
versions.  I'll also keep a compendium of suggestions and comments
which people want to send here available under magic name Z1PCRIT
(Zone One Policy Critique) for an uncompressed version or Z1PCRZIP,
Z1PCRARC, Z1PCRARJ, Z1PCRLZH, size dependant upon what people send me.

I don't pretend that my rough draft of a zone policy is either perfect
or will find acceptance with all.  Still, I hope it's enough to get
the Zone One *Cs to either modify it and establish it or produce a
superior document and vote that in.  My writing this is not a
criticism of any individual or group within FidoNet. Rather, it is a
recognition on my part of what some others have known for a long time
and what still others need to realize, that it is time to recognize
the growth and change which has taken place since expanding from
having NetMail as the only method of electronic communication within
FidoNet.
