     EuroCon IV: A General Overview to a Great Happening !

     Subj: announcement Eurocon IV
     -------------------------------------
     Hello to you all,

     On behalf of the organisation committee of Eurocon III I herewith
     announce that Belgium will be the organising country for Eurocon
     IV.

     Ward Dossche has sent us a very good proposal which Peter
     Janssens will post here within a few days. [...] we think that
     the Belgian proposal is very good and Eurocon IV should therefore
     be organised in Belgium.

     Regards, <JM>

     1. ... or maybe a bit clearer ?
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     When I was preparing this article, it crossed my mind, to start
     telling you something about the history of FidoNet. But probably
     most of you would already know all that stuff, so there was the
     chance that you would drop of, just because of boredom. And that
     would be a shame, really, because EuroCon is an occasion, which
     every European FidoNet sysop should have seen at least once !

     EuroCon is a happening which developed itself thru FidoNet-
     history:  Apparently, sometimes echomail is just not good enough
     to keep good contacts between regions, so at a certain point in
     time, it became clear that it would be really nice (if not
     actually necessary), to organise a European Sysop-meeting. In the
     United States, these happenings had already been organised: They
     called it FidoCon.

     FidoNews 7-18                Page 2                   30 Apr 1990


     So four years ago, the first European Sysop-meeting, EuroCon,
     was organised.  From then on, it was decided to organise such an
     international meeting yearly.


     2. And this year...
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     This year, Eurocon will be organised in Antwerp, Belgium, on July
     14th and 15th. Antwerp is one of Belgium's biggest ports. The
     historical city is a very convenient conference-city: Many
     suitable hotels, in all price-classes are available, there is an
     International Youth Hostel and a camping place. Since Antwerp is
     an international city, it is very easy for foreigners to find
     their way around: Most touristical, hotel- and other staff are
     multilingual (Dutch, French and English are common; German is not
     unusual).  Furthermore, the city of Antwerp is easily reached by
     car, train and airplane.


     3. But what about the meeting itself ?
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     You're right. Better tell you someting about what's going to
     happen on EuroCon IV. As matter of fact, EuroCon IV will be a bit
     different from the EuroCon's before. This time, there will be 3
     FidoNet conferences going on simultaneously ! The first one is
     USERCON I. This conference will be dedicated entirely to Region
     29 matters (Belgium). It is a meeting between sysops, points and
     users of FidoNet Belgium. It will be open to the general public.
     Obviously, this meeting won't be too interesting to the foreign
     guests. It is merely a practical matter to organise UserCon I
     during EuroCon IV.  The other 2 conferences however will be
     *very* interesting. Let's start with the new one...

     The new one is TECHCON I. It will be a purely technical
     conference on FidoNet matters. Provisions are being made, to
     invite as many as possible developers of P.D., ShareWare or
     commercial software. In particular, people being active in
     developing mailers, terminal programs, BBS software and
     utilities, packers, and whatever else is being used by amateur
     communication freaks. Also manufacturers of comms hardware will
     be invited.
     It will be required to register in advance. You will be informed
     about this in a few weeks, thru the FidoNews magazine, thru some
     echomail channels (e.g. ENET.SYSOP), and also in EMBBS magazine.
     But the main conference of course will be EuroCon IV ...
     (tataaah...)

     EuroCon IV will traditionally be devoted exclusively to the
     phenomenon 'netpolicy'. Netpolicy, is the whole of rules which
     are keeping the net up and operational. Without them,
     communication in FidoNet would be impossible. Some main themes
     that will be discussed are:

     FidoNews 7-18                Page 3                   30 Apr 1990


     EEC- and European matters :

     * The private computer-communication market after 1992
     * Changing policy in the great internal market
     * Creation of a European sysop-association
     * Telephone companies and future European approval standards for
       telecommunications hardware
     * Auto-censoring, privacy and ownership of public electronic-mail
       information
     * Developments in Eastern-Europe

     Internal policy matters :

     * Electronic-mail policy
     * Electronic-mail routing
     * Elections
     * Appointing EUROCON-V site
     * Democracy within FidoNet
     * Complaint-procedure

     Technical matters :

     * Fast modems (V32 - PEP - HST)
     * Automated mailer software
     * Technical standards
     * New communication protocols

     I guess you've got a general idea now, about what's going to be
     discussed at EuroCon IV. Clearly EuroCon is a very important
     conference. Because even if an amateur network is technically
     capable of functioning well, it is only thru real human
     communication, agreement and understanding, between the thousands
     of participants, that such a huge network can be maintained.
     And that really needs some agreements. Without them, FidoNet
     would surely collapse.  It is at meetings like EuroCon, that one
     builds the strong structures that have kept FidoNet alive, all
     these years !


     4. Back down to the 'earthly' matters...
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     The programme, which of course can be subject to some minor
     changes, will look like this:

     * Friday July 13th
     - Evening: Arrival most participants.
     - Pre-meeting between the organising committee and the RC's and
       ZC2, to discuss the coming days, set some priorities, and iron-
       out whatever needs to be ironed out.

     * Saturday July 14th
     - Morning: EuroCon session-1
     - Noon: Luch of course !
     - Afternoon: EuroCon session-2
     - Evening: Dinner, and optional '11-kroegentocht', not to be
     FidoNews 7-18                Page 4                   30 Apr 1990


       missed by all beer-drinkers ! (Belgium is a country famous for
       its beers !)

     * Sunday July 15th
     - morning: EuroCon session-3
     - noon: lunch
     - afternoon: EuroCon session-4

       registered participants, sponsors, companies and other people
       that have contributed to the organising of EuroCon-IV.
     - After 10pm: Everybody can seek a form of entertainment suitable
       to his/her own needs.

     * Monday July 15th
     - morning: Check-out and departure of most participants.


     There is also a fringe-programme for participants and relatives.
     Including:
     - Visit to the port of Antwerp.
     - Visit to the famous Antwerp ZOO.
     - Factory-visit.


     5. But, isn't there always one more thing to say ?
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Yes, there is:
     You can send us your remarks, questions and suggestions. We have
     opened a special node for EuroCon-IV. It has nodenumber
     2:2/999.0, and it is open for mail 24 hours a day. We will be
     happy to get some feedback, so that we can keep your suggestions
     in mind, while setting up the meeting in detail.
     You can address your messages to Ward Dossche, the team-leader of
     the organising team. You can also write Ward or me a message in
     ENET.SYSOP.
     And above all: Be looking out for more information about EuroCon
     IV. In a few weeks, we will start distributing registration
     forms. Don't hesitate to join the conference. Don't put away that
     form somewhere you'll probably forget it.  Without you, it would
     be much less fun ! We count on you ! Try to be there in July !

     Jan Spooren (2:295/20.0)
     Electronic-Press attache (Umpf!)

     P.S.: We just received a message from Tomas Bremin (2:201/110.0),
     moderator of InterUser: He tells us, we can expect a group of 15
     to 30 people from InterUser, who are going to meet eachother at
     EuroCon IV !  Watch my words: It'll be quite a happening !!

                  REGION 17 FIDO CONVENTION

     FidoNet  Sysops  and  their  families and friends  are  cordially
     invited  to  attend  a  Region17  convention  hosted  by   Net105
     (VanPort;   aka "Home of the Curmudgeon") July 27-29  at  Menucha
     Retreat  and  Conference  Center.   This will be the only  "Fido"
     convention  on  the  West  Coast this summer;  guests outside the
     boundaries of Region17 are more than welcome to attend.

     Menucha was  once  the  summer  home  of Julius Meier, founder of
     Meier & Frank  department stores and a former Governor of Oregon.
     "Menucha" means "waters of  refreshment"  in Hebrew and is an apt
     description of the unique natural  setting  -  98 acres of lawns,
     woodlands and gardens - high on  a bluff overlooking the Columbia
     River.  The main buildings were constructed  around  1914 and are
     historical  sites.    Recreation  includes  a  75x30  ft  outdoor
     swimming pool,  regulation  tennis  court,  basketball, horseshoe
     pits, a surfaced  volleyball  court,  table tennis, and biliards.
     There are also numerous trails for hiking.

     Menucha is located in  Corbett,  Oregon  -  30  minutes  from the
     Portland International Airport and about 45 minutes from downtown
     Portland.  Freeways I-84, I-5, and I-205 are close by.

     Convention prices are extremely affordable if you register before
     May  15th.   Menucha offers dormitories and  family-style  meals,
     with a few semi-private and private accomodations.   For example,
     for  an  adult  FidoNet  Sysop  who  elects to arrive  on  Friday
     afternoon, sleep in his sleeping bag in a dorm, and  stay through
     Sunday  morning,  the  cost  is  a  mere $70.50 (meals included).
     Reduced prices apply to children, students, and spouses.

     See the  subsequent message for an official registration form, or
     NetMail Janet Murray  @  105/23 or Ken Zwaschka @ 105/54 for more
     information.

            From
        Violet Stymacks
            at the
       Rhinoceros Kitchen
           1:152/8
         Eugene, Oregon

     When Ray (co-sysop of Rhinoceros Kitchen and myself first set-up
     housekeeping together he told me," How much he was INTO
     computers " :-}
     I had NO IDEA just how much time he talking about.
     Well it didn't take long for me to start calling the computer
     THE OTHER WOMAN.God, how I hated the THING.
     Being Dyslexic I would not go near the computer. Then one day he
     downloaded a game called Hack and soon I would sit by his side
     and watch him play(giving my input as to what he should do.):-)
     Then he showed me how to play it myself. This was BEFORE we had
     a Hard Disk. After a while my Characters got soooo big that I
     needed to shuffle 4 floppies to hold them, so I got kind of
     comfortable with the machine. (I won the game 14 times) and Ray
     was very good about letting me share computer time with him.
     Then Ray helped a friend set up a BBS (a game board) next thing
     I knew he was thinking of starting a BBS of his own. I smiled
     and said I thought he should give it a try. But I was thinking "
     now I will never see or be able to talk to him because he will
     be with " HER " (the computer) all the time.
     Well I sure didn't fool Ray one bit with that smile , he sat me
     down with THEDRAW and had me do asci screens for the message
     bases.
     Then a local sysop asked if I would do an ansi welcome screen
     for his board. Next I was making screens for boards all over
     Eugene.
     Then we became a node on FidoNet.I started cruising the node
     list looking for names I liked the sound of and I would make an
     ansi drawing and send it to them.
     I also put a copy in the <<RK>> art gallery. Most people liked
     what I sent to them and used it. An ansi/asci screen from me is
     a GIFT, not the beginning of some advertising "pitch" or
     anything else.
     I send a follow up message asking if they are using the screen,
     if I don't hear from them after a while. If they are not using
     it I " give it a face lift " and send it to some one else. I
     call the screen a " LOGO " but sysops put them anywhere on the
     board they want.I put the "OLD" logo screen some sysops send
     with their thank you message,in a guest art gallery that i have
     on our bbs.About 5 boards have my whole (a zip file of about
     400k) art gallery on their board.

     At this time about 290 BBS are using one or more ansi/asci
     screens I have made. Most are in the USA, thirty are in Canada,
     seven in zone2 and three in zone3 (that I know of). :-)

     The truly sad part of all this is Ray almost never gets time to
     use the computer anymore.
     :-)

     ----
     a quick note from ray here.I wanted to call this article
     "computer shortage crises at rhinoceros kitchen",but Violet
     wrote it,and after all,it IS about her art work.
      Violet's art gallery is compressed into art.zip during 5:00 am
     maintenance EVERY morning and is available for file requests as
     ART.ZIP anytime,except midnight to 2:00 am Pacific time.The old
     art.zip is deleted just before the new one is made, this way it
     is updated daily.

     Spun Wrong --

     I read about this SpinRite program and thought I might try it
     out because, well, you know I have 6 hard disks between home
     and office machines.  As it turns out, I was led astray, and
     I'll tell you why.

     Reading the shrink wrap at the store, I caught some fine print :
     NOT compatible with Plus hard cards.  OK, 1 down, 5 to go.  I
     buy it and get on to work.  My main system there, the NCR has a
     16-bit SCSI and 320 meg hard disk.  Sorry.  SpinRite thinks it
     sees a CACHE, HA.  2 down, 4 to go.  I start reading the online
     docs.  ERLL on a Compaq portable, NOT supported.  3 down.

     I get it home.  ESDI NOT supported.  4 down.  This leaves the
     old 286 portable, which sports an SDSI ( 5 down ) and a
     Imprimis regular old 80 on a WD MFM controller.  OK, 1 drive
     out of 6.  Be forewarned.

     This brings up another sore point.  That 80 meg drive is really
     84, but I can only get some 72 megs recognized by my BIOS.  It
     seems that the drive type table is the key to this whole mess.
     Compaq is really nasty about the drive types supported, which
     is to their benefit when you want to add some space.  This
     nonsense has to change.

     An interesting note in the SpinRite docs is the 'new SDSI
     drives' which they don't support.  New, my baby's butt.


     Greenleaf Comm Lib --

     I picked up the latest version of this software library and was
     really impressed.  With just 3 functions, OPEN, PUTC and GETC I
     had a finished comm program.  It can get a lot fancier than
     that too.  There's even a single function Send_Ymodem_G.

     I wrote a tiny program that sends a user defined message, waits
     for a timer or a response from the host system, and sends
     another message.  The host system is the cool machine, it is
     switching video signals.  The demo has 6 video disk players,
     and 12 Sony 9 inch color TVs, and my comm program is talking to
     the application, switching the different players ( and a couple
     of internally generated test patterns ) across the TVs.

     FidoNews 7-18                Page 15                  30 Apr 1990


     The marketing guys did OK too, the video disks included
     Indiana, Trek, Rabbit and a really neat computer generated
     video documentary.  I quickly implemented a better transmit
     hold routine because my program kept switching the signals
     during the good scenes.

     Greenleaf got a bad rap because of some weird happenings back in
     the Opus 0.0 development days.  Based upon my recent
     experiences, their products are top notch.


     Oracle Database Echo --

     I have been working with the Oracle database for over a year and
     the SQL language as well.  I noticed that there wasn't an echo
     for these topics.  So I started one, it's called ORA_DBMS.

     Oracle is probably the largest database company, with similar
     software running on dozens of platforms.  If there's one thing
     BAD about their products, it's the documentation and support.
     In fact, it's a nightmare.  Maybe this echo can allow better
     access to other user's, with the subsequent increase in
     information.  Of course, it may become the biggest FLAME forum
     yet.  We shall see.

     In any case, if you're interested in, or are using Oracle, or
     any other SQL based relational database, you are invited to
     pick up ORA_DBMS.  At this time, the echo is distributed
     locally, including myself 1:124/6120 and by our DFW echo mail
     distributor, 1:124/4115.  As this is the first echo I have
     tried to get started, you may know more about proper channels
     to pick it up.


     Ghost in the Machine --

     Well it does look like I got screwed by an early Fidonews
     release mechanism.  ( What do want for nothin', eh ? )  I swear
     I had that last column on 1:1/1 Sunday morning at 01:00.  The
     news archive was created at 11:00 and the news file data is
     midnight Monday.

     So that bit on the Lake Party was delayed a week.  ( You missed
     me, right ? ).  Now you'll have to wait another week for the
     skinny on the Great Event.  I promise some juicy details aired
     in public, Enquirer fashion.
