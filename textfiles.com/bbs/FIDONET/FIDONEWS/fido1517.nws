                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================

     During the past week, having re-obtained transportation under the new
     emissions standards in California, I sought a bit of diversion in a
     bit of travel...and I took along the well-worn and dog-eared copy of
     Ayn Rand's ATLAS SHRUGGED to pass the non-travel time.

     I'm more and more amazed at the parallels between FidoNet and the
     opus of individualistic logic.

     What form of government is FidoNet composed of?  A democracy?

     A democracy is one in which the people function as their own
     government...yet many crying for a democracy are the same ones who
     are crying about the lack of action by our leaders.

     A democracy is one in which people have a set of rules or guidelines
     to function under, so no one can trample on the rights of others...
     yet many of those crying about the trampling of these rights are the
     same who refuse to recognize the Policy which we operate under.

     A democracy is one in which all can participate in matters which can
     affect them...yet many of those crying about the need to be involved
     are not affected in the least by the discussions that they are moving
     in upon.

     A democracy is one in which a majority of persons involved have the
     ability to enforce and cause changes...and yet a small minority of
     less than a dozen individuals is claiming that they should control
     the future of a region, without a single claim to ability than that
     they "have been wronged" by "those in charge".

     Not really a claim to ability or a indicator of qualification, no?

     If you haven't read ATLAS SHRUGGED, please do so...do not let the
     1100+ pages daunt you, as it may change your ideas on what is the
     real meaning of being "liberal" or "conservative" truly means...

     ...as well as who is _really_ "working" for _your_ benefit.

     An interesting thing, this week, and I note it here so that no one
     can go back and point it out incorrectly.

     Doc Logger submitted his LOGGER45.COL this week, after his
     LOGGER43.COL last week.  I point this out so that no one can accuse
     me of having censored or deleted a column.  More interesting is the
     poll that Doc has submitted...I know that I need not point out to
     others that statistics can be made to say whatever one wants;
     especially when subjective influences are brought into the mix.
     I'm presuming that the poll is LOGGER44.COL.

     Also, from last week's submission is the news release on the ARCH
     Virtual Museum...an interesting concept that members in Zone 2 may be
     better able to take advantage of in person than others.
     FIDONEWS 15-17               Page 2                   27 Apr 1998


     Beyond that, the Fido Wars continue...

     Has anyone in Zone 2, other than the Regional Coordinators, been
     asked about the intention of Ward Dossche when he stated that "Zone 2
     would go its own way" since he was not elected as the International
     Coordinator?

     Just a question.

     =================================================================


     Dear Editorbeing,

     This article is submitted by Doc Logger (163/100 or
     cherriot@magmacom.com) whose eyes carried that same sort of
     glazed look that Dean Rusk had when he was busy bombing the
     world for peace & democracy. Logger's confused state had
     everything to do with reading hundreds of survey answers...

     Roll da flic, Zorch....

     Dear Reverend Visage,

     Thank you for thoughtfully sending 30,000 cute baby Harp
     seals to the offices of Swamp Swine Magazine. I know, I
     know...you assured me that it would be a perfect gift for
     Bridgit Bardot but do you have any idea what Harp seals eat?
     Can you fathom how they smell after processing several tons
     of oily fish? The only things that I've experienced which
     even come close to the stench were the sugar refineries in
     Fiji and the Democratic Convention in '68. I immediately
     shipped them off to the Easter Seals campaign and told 'em
     that they were really Jerry's kids. Since we seem to be
     exchanging gifts, I had several truckloads of sheep manure
     delivered to your driveway. Prunella will be so pleased when
     she emerges from the garage at full throttle.

     I would have attended to your urgent plea for more cash had
     I not been devoting my energies to building a Theremin for
     my son's excremental rock band. I figure that since the band
     has only learned three notes, that they might as well have
     an instrument which sounds suspiciously like aborting whales
     on Methedrine. The neighbours and the noise by-law
     enforcement officers have agreed that the sound exceeds new
     thresholds in the sonic insult department. (This probably
     explains why women are still throwing goldfish at my bedroom
     window late at night.) My son tells me that I am being
     unkind by characterizing his music as "Skunk rock" (music
     that truly stinks) but at least they don't do any John
     Denver covers.

     I think I have figured out the entire skill set needed by a
     ZC. Apparently, all you have to do is program a function key
     so that it quotes a whole message and appends the word
     "noted" to the end. Since Bob Satti carefully shepherds the
     42 words he writes each week, this leaves ample room to get
     really expansive on the larger issues. For example, when he
     was asked what qualities or platform did he advance which
     gained the support of the other ZCs to elect Satti as the
     IC, in a positively verbose display of literary genius he
     wrote:"Why don't you ask them?" Hint for Blondes: Yo Bob, I
     just asked you. In point of fact I did ask the other ZCs who
     FIDONEWS 15-17               Page 7                   27 Apr 1998


     were equally sparing with the text. When asked, one ZC told
     me: "because Bob Satti got a majority of votes." Okay so
     logic wasn't one of those subjects that kept me awake at
     university but answering a question about a platform with a
     statement that the election is complete strikes me as a
     tadge absurd. I suspect that some of the ZCs aren't playing
     with a full set of disciples at the supper table. Our
     prayers and our edible underwear should go out to them in
     their hour of need.

     I think also that the *Cs haven't taken seriously the radish
     problem that has been developing in the miscellaneous
     elflord echos. As a professional trendmonger, I tend to spot
     these things in their larval stages so it is best to get
     them lashed down before they larvate into another Netwar.

     Did you notice that it is getting hotter on Zorch's planet.
     He keeps mentioning the "scorched earth policy" without
     elaborating on exactly what he means. I also spotted what
     looked like a statement that Ward was so bored that he
     played with his business card GIF. Gawd, when his Zorchness
     has to do that much deep-sea diving to come up with a new
     conspiracy theory then I think it is time he added more
     tinfoil to his windows to keep out the Venutian thought
     control radio waves. I also noted that last week's Snooz was
     full of vulture effluvia from RanD whose reading material
     seems to be dedicated to the nodelist. As the good and
     decent people that we are, we should send him a copy of
     "Bromiliads of the Antarctic Plateau" so that RanD's
     fudge-like mind can be improved.

     For this week's Chautauqua I'll start with an amusing quote
     from the book "The Demonic Comedy" by Paul William Roberts.
     Roberts spent time in Iraq working as a correspondent for
     Saturday Night Magazine. The exchange quoted here occurred
     between Roberts and an Iraqui factotum named Omar:

     " 'We have democracy here,' Omar assured me, 'Although
     people saying we are not. Why are they saying that?'

     'The reason they are saying that, Omar, is because your
     president wasn't elected, and you have no official
     opposition parties. It may seem a quibble, I know, but we
     Westerners are a spoiled lot.'

     'Saddam he is *elected*!!' His voice soared into a warbling
     treble. 'What is this bull's sheet, not *elected*?'

     'Who elected him?'

     'Revolutionary Council is electing him.'

     'How is the Revolutionary Council elected?'

     'Saddam he is personally choosing them,' replied Omar , with
     pride.
     FIDONEWS 15-17               Page 8                   27 Apr 1998


     'Oh well, sorry then: that sounds pretty democratic to me.'

     He grunted satisfaction. 'Yes. People they not understanding
     Iraqui way. They too much jealous that we now have the most
     advanced nation on earth.' "

     Poor Omar. If only he'd known that Fidonet had achieved the
     same "democratic" zenith he would have been cowed for sure.
     Or perhaps Omar was the consultant hired to create Policy4
     because it is hard to imagine the document being written by
     anyone with less than his keen grasp of political
     philosophy. The fact that the elflords are still hiding
     behind the skirts of policy in the face of rather
     overwhelming sentiment suggesting a different course of
     action is a true monument to the ZC/RCCs. Included in a
     separate article in this week's Snooz are the results of a
     survey I conducted. If the results are accurate which I
     believe them to be, then it is time for the elflords to
     clamber down from their respective perches and change the
     operating procedures which have dismayed the sysop peasantry
     for so long.

     One of the grievous omissions in my survey report is that I
     forgot to thank all those who took the time to respond. A
     thousand thank-yous to you all for helping me cast a little
     light into the darkness of the elflords' lair.

     I must go, Visage, my son just fired up the Theremin and the
     house is surrounded by lawyers in heat. It seems that they
     don't believe that simulating the fall of Jericho is an
     appropriate activity here in the Pink Flamingo Paradise. The
     first vibrant chords of the Theremin at a mere 800 watts
     only leveled three city blocks so I don't know what they're
     whining about. As the good and decent people that we are, I
     suggest that the lawyers be re-trained to become productive
     members of society... as sociologists.

     Interim Poll Results

     Completed surveys are still trickling in but there have been
     enough responses to clearly indicate trends. Using
     nodelist.100, I processed the list for duplicate phone
     numbers which carried the same sysop name. The duplicates
     were removed from the list, as were occurrences of the same
     FIDONEWS 15-17               Page 9                   27 Apr 1998


     name under different telephone numbers. While this didn't
     eliminate all of the duplicates since a number of net
     function addresses were identified by title, it did set a
     upper maximum number of sysops in Zone 1 at 4,755. Taking
     20% of that number, a second list was compiled to select the
     951 addresses who would receive the survey.

     Each of 342 NCs were automatically put on the survey list,
     and an additional 609 sysops were chosen. The selected
     sysops were chosen by counting the nodes in each net, taking
     20% of that number, and then randomly selecting the
     appropriate number of nodes. A minimum of 1 sysop in
     addition to the NC was selected from each net. To adjust for
     the rounding up that resulted from taking at least one
     sysop, the number of surveys sent to net163 was reduced.

     Commencing April 12 and ending April 19th, attempts were
     made to send the survey to all 951 sysops by crashmail. Part
     of the list was sent by Malcolm Campbell (163/307) and the
     balance was sent directly from my system. Routed netmail was
     not used to send the surveys.

     Of those where an attempt was made, 86 nodes could not be
     sent the survey either because their line was answered with
     a voice, an answering machine, a fax machine, or my system
     could not initiate a successful mail session once a
     connection was made to a working modem. The survey was
     therefore sent to 865 sysops which is 18% of Zone 1. The
     survey was also posted in various echos with an open
     invitation to submit responses. (Only 4 responses were
     generated as a result of posting in echomail conferences.)

     As of April 22, 1998 at 3:30pm, I have received 273
     responses which represents a return rate of 31% and
     represents 5.74% of the nodelisted sysops in Zone 1. (My
     goal was to get surveys from at least 5% of the Zone's
     sysops.) I feel that the sample was large enough to be
     representative and reflective of sysop opinion.

     The survey consisted on 12 questions. For a number of the
     questions the answers that were tendered were a simple "yes"
     or "no" response. For some of the questions, many
     respondents wrote at least several sentences and some wrote
     a great deal more than that. For example, the text file
     where I captured the answers to Question 10 is 165 pages
     long! In addition, a number of respondents wrote on other
     issues which they felt hadn't been addressed in the survey.



     Results: Question 1: From your perspective, what is the
     greatest challenge facing Fidonet? (ie. what is broken, what
     should be fixed, and how would you fix it?)

     C lack of users               15%
     D lack of good BBS interface  13%
     E nothing wrong               11%
     F poor echomail content        5%
     G over-regulation              1%
     H sysop apathy                 1%
     I lack of fun                  1%

     Note: Results total to more than 100% because many sysops
     gave multiple reasons.

     Of those who expressed a variant of poor leadership,
     commentary ranged from:

     "Poor to no sysop representation at the higher levels. Too
     much administration in a hobby network. Power mongering!"

     to

     "The greatest challenge facing Fido is that the upper *C
     structure thinks they own Fido. Their total disregard for
     what grunt sysops want is driving systems away daily."

     to

     "Get rid of Satti and that ridiculous system of appointing
     RCs who then vote for the ZC. Banana republics would be
     ashamed of this nonsense."

     Of the sysops who cited the Internet, most characterized its
     graphics and global accessibility as something which Fido
     could not compete. A number of sysops suggested creating a
     good GUI for BBS access and widely distributing it.

     Conclusion: The natives are restless and would like the
     upper *C structure to tune in as opposed to "ruling." The
     anecdotal commentary suggested that upper *Cs are viewed as
     unresponsive and often capricious, particularly the R10C and
     the R11C. On the plus side, good things were said about Ken
     Tuley and Jerry Schwartz.


     Results: Question 2: Do you read Fidonews?

     A: Always      37%
     B: Sometimes   34%
     C: Often        6%
     D: Never       23%

     Of those sysops who indicated that they never read Fidonews,
     47% said they would read it if they could get it from their
     NC/NEC but that it simply wasn't available or distributed in
     their net.

     Best unintended humour came from a sysop who "never read
     Fidonews" but who also suggested that I ought to write an
     FIDONEWS 15-17               Page 11                  27 Apr 1998


     article commenting on the behaviour of *Cs.

     Conclusion: If Fidonews is the "glue that binds Fidonet
     together" then perhaps an attempt should be made to
     distribute it to all sysops. Whether sysops read it or not
     is a matter of their own choice but Fidonews could certainly
     be made more meaningful if the ZC/RCs used it to announce
     administrative matters.

     Results: Question 3: Were you (or your NC) elected by sysop
     level vote?

     A: Yes         78%
     B: No          20%
     C: Don't know   2%

     Of the reasons cited by people who answered "no", 76% said
     that there was no vote because only one candidate was
     willing to take the job.

     Conclusion: At the NC level, sysop level voting for NCs is
     common place with only parts of Regions 10 & 11 still having
     RCs appoint NCs.

     Results: Question 3b: Was your RC elected by sysop level
     vote? If not, what mechanism was used to select your RC?

     A: Sysop level vote  68%
     B: Appointed         15%
     C: NC level vote      7%
     D: Don't know        10%


     Conclusion: Sysop level votes are commonplace within Zone1
     with Regions 10 & 11 being exceptions.

     Results: Question 4: Were you consulted by your NC or RC
     with respect to the recent election of a new International
     Coordinator?

     A: No      89%
     B: Yes     11%

     Of those who answered "yes", 87% said that they'd read about
     the election in either the Z1C or the ZCC-PUBLIC echo, or
     read it in a Fidonews column.

     Conclusion: The sysops were not consulted, and therefore the
     Z1C had no mandate to cast a vote on behalf of Zone 1.


     Results: Question 5: If you were not consulted, would you
     prefer to have been given the opportunity to do so?

     A: Yes                           67%
     B: No                            16%

     C: Not applicable, don't care    17%


     Conclusion: The ZC should improve efforts to communicate
     with sysops on significant issues.


     Results: Question 6: If policy could be amended(or ignored)
     would you prefer that NCs, RCs, and ZCs be elected? If so,
     would you prefer a sysop level vote? (if you favour
     elections and have another suggested mechanism, then please
     indicate what it is.)

     A: sysop level votes for all *C positions               57%
     B: sysops vote for NCs,NCs vote for RCs,RCs vote for ZC 27%
     C: current P4 system of appointments                    11%
     D: don't know, don't care                                5%

     Conclusions: Taken in context with the answers given in 3 &
     3B, sysop votes are already in practice and 84% of sysops
     would prefer election procedures for all *Cs.

     Results: Question 7: Have you ever filed a policy complaint?

     A: No    84%
     B: Yes   16%

     Of the respondents who answered "yes", 94% were either NCs
     or RCs.


     Results: Question 8: Have you ever had a policy complaint
     filed against you?

     A: No   79%
     B: Yes  21%

     Of the people who answered "no", 67% said that while a
     complaint was never filed against them, they were threatened
     with one at least once.


     Conclusion: Either 21% of the Zone sysops are Fidocriminals,
     or policy complaints are being filed for frivolous reasons.

     Question 9: Are there issues in Echomail which you feel need
     more rules to regulate, control, or illuminate?


     A: No                                     79%
     B: Yes, with respect to moderator duties  11%
     C: Yes, with respect to other issues       5%
     D: No opinion                              3%
     E: Yes (no elaboration)                    2%

     Conclusion: It is unlikely that a new Echopol document will
     FIDONEWS 15-17               Page 13                  27 Apr 1998


     receive support or ratification by the Zone 1 sysops.


     Result: Question 10: The nodelist in Zone 1 is shrinking
     because sysops are leaving Fidonet. What is your best guess
     about why they are leaving and what could be done to
     encourage them to stay?

     It was this question which produced the longest and most
     thoughtful responses. Almost all respondents cited the
     Internet as being a competitive force against which Fidonet
     can't compete. The vast publicity that attends the Internet
     makes it the first choice of new modem/computer users when
     they want to link to a communication network. The existence
     of Fidonet is a well-kept secret in most municipalities.

     As a matter of historical perspective, in 1990 I surveyed a
     wide variety of Region 12 sysops. Using the definition for
     an "active user" as someone who had called the BBS more than
     50 times, 100% of the BBS systems had over 20 active users.
     Some had as many as 800. A similar mini-poll today indicates
     that a BBS would be lucky to have 5 active users and more
     than half exist with the sysop as the only participant on
     the BBS.

     One respondent summed up what turned out to be the majority
     opinion when he said "Attractiveness of the Internet without
     immature and illiterate power-mongers setting policy, making
     rules, making irreversible arbitrary decisions..." There is
     a deeply felt anger and frustration with the upper *C
     structure where it is felt that creative leadership has been
     replaced with entrenched non-responsiveness. One respondent
     asked "How did we get from Tom Jennings' noble dream to the
     likes of Bob Kohl?"

     Of those who tendered positive suggestions, the most
     frequent suggestion was to develop a GUI for BBS access and
     get it widely distributed. Several respondents suggested
     bundling a GUI interface with new computers as a result of a
     cooperative effort with retailers.

     A small minority (of which I count myself a member) believe
     that part of the problem is in the intrinsic lack of energy
     devoted to writing messages in echomail conferences. One
     respondent said "What do you expect when the 'breaker
     breaker' CB radio idiots sat in front of a keyboard? A
     higher level of communication? Serious conversation? Forget
     it."

     Recommendations:

     To Bob Satti:

     1) Encourage the RCs and NCs to re-establish the
     distribution of Fidonews so that it is available to leaf
     node sysops.
     FIDONEWS 15-17               Page 14                  27 Apr 1998


     2) Use Fidonews to disseminate your administrative positions
     and to inform the sysops of significant matters.

     3) Use the "exception" powers granted to the IC to ask the
     other ZCs for their approval to launch a policy change
     initiative. Specifically, ask for assent to create
     Zone-specific changes to policy with respect to
     selection/election of *Cs. Announce your intention to seek
     this assent in Fidonews and ask your RCs to collect a
     consensus opinion on the issue from sysops in their regions.

     4) Whether you obtain  assent from the ZCC or not, put to a
     sysop vote a selection of choices for the mechanisms by
     which *Cs obtain office in Zone 1. Announce the process in
     Fidonews along with an anticipated time frame for the
     results of the vote to become effective.

     To ZC/RCs:

     5) Create/appoint/call for volunteers - for a working group
     to devise a GUI interface which can be put into the public
     domain and freely distributed. (If it weren't for the
     efforts of a similar group that created the miscellaneous
     early software, Fidonet wouldn't exist.)

     6) Step back a pace or two and ask the question: Who do you
     serve? Then ask if your present mode of operation is
     constructive or destructive. Ask the sysops how you're
     doing.

     7) Help - not force - the echomail distribution system to
     become fully functional. Most of the work has already been
     done by the Stars and RECs  but at the net level there are
     significant logjams.

     To NCs:

     8) Establish in your net a group of capable people who are
     willing to assist sysops to either set up a BBS, or get it
     smoothly functioning. One of the foundations that built
     Fidonet was the willingness of sysops to help each other.
     Some of that tradition has been lost when a sysop who
     encounters difficulty receives not an offer of assistance,
     but a threat of expulsion.

     9) Advise the sysops in your net that if they wish to be
     informed about administrative matters, that they ought to at
     least glance through Fidonews which you make available for
     file request from your system.

     10) Repeat as often as is necessary: "I'm a nodelist clerk.
     I'm a nodelist clerk" until all thoughts of exercising power
     over sysops is gone from your mind.

     To moderators:

     FIDONEWS 15-17               Page 15                  27 Apr 1998


     11) Common practice grants extraordinary powers to
     moderators. Use it judiciously and sparingly. Educate rather
     than dictate, illuminate rather than invoke closure, and
     create rather than curtail. Look up the word "moderation" in
     the dictionary and be guided by what you read there. Perhaps
     as a pleasant change, post a set of "echo goals" as opposed
     to "echo rules."

     To sysops:

     12) A lot of people devote a lot of hardware, time and
     energy to bringing mail to your modem. Thank 'em every once
     in awhile and let them know that you appreciate it. (Thanks
     Ken) The Stars, the RECs & NECs make Fidonet happen and most
     of them are damned good at it.

     13) Ask yourself if communication is the whole point of
     Fidonet. If so, consider your actions and decisions based
     upon fostering that goal.

     To everyone:

     14) Fidonet, with or without formal rules relies upon the
     goodwill and cooperation of sysops. View with skepticism any
     rule which intrudes on that simple premise. Fidonet does not
     have to be an organization where common sense, cooperation
     and simple justice are brushed aside because a higher value
     is put on a policy document.

     15) Get rid of the lame macros, the emoticons, the
     screenfuls of quoted text, and engage the subjects of your
     conversation with pride and energy. The soul of Fidonet is
     in the messages you write.

     16) And finally, eschew yogurt.

     Regards,
     Doc

     DOS Users Anonymous
     by Mike Riddle, mriddle@monarch.papillon.ne.us

     Subject: DOS users anonymous

     DOS Users Anonymous 12 Step Program

     The heart of the DUA's suggested program of personal recovery is
     contained in Twelve Steps describing the experience of the earliest
     recovering DOS users:

      1. We admitted we were powerless over upgrades - that our computers
         had become unmanageable.

      2. Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves
         - Microsoft - could restore us to sanity.

      3. Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care
         of Bill Gates as we understood Him.

      4. Made a searching and fearless Defrag and Scandisk of our hard
         drive.

      5. Admitted to Bill Gates to ourselves and to our list server the
         exact version of our current operating system.

      6. Were entirely ready to have Windows 95 remove all these
         accustomed benefits of convenience, reliability, and
         productivity.

      7. Humbly asked him to remove our current operating system's
         simplicity.

      8. Made a list of all files (hidden or system) we had accidentally
         deleted and became willing to commit to the Window's 95
         recycling feature.

      9. Made direct payment to Microsoft or its agent wherever possible,
         except when to do so would require us to use the MS Network.

     10. Continued to struggle with the Win 95 installation program and
         when we were finally out of time and patience promptly admitted
         it to Microsoft product support.

     11. Sought through the Microsoft home page to improve our conscious
         contact with Bill Gates as we understood Him, asking only for
         knowledge of His will for us and software (conforming to the
         Active Accessibility standard) to carry that out.

     12. Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps,
         we tried to carry this message to disabled computer users
     FIDONEWS 15-17               Page 17                  27 Apr 1998


         everywhere and to use Windows 95 (or higher) applications in all
         our computing.

     Newcomers are not asked to accept or follow these Twelve Steps in
     their entirety if they feel unwilling or unable to do so.

     InterMail 2.50 Released!

                  FURTHER DEVELOPMENT RELEASES INTERMAIL 2.50!

     April 20, 1998
     1:369/35

     (Coconut Creek, Fla.) Further Development, Inc. (FDI), announced
     today the release of the long-awaited InterMail v2.50.

     When asked why development of the new InterMail has taken so long,
     Peter Stewart, FDI President and author of the popular Fidonet-style,
     front-end mailer said, "We honestly thought it would only take a few
     weeks to complete... Still, we believe we beat out the "other guys"
     when compared to their estimates."

     Michele Stewart, FDI COO and wife of the author, provided additional
     details regarding the company's latest release. "We just won't
     FIDONEWS 15-17               Page 19                  27 Apr 1998


     release a product we feel isn't stable or complete," she said.
     "A program released on time with major bugs left in is just not our
     style. We'd rather wait and provide our customers with a solid,
     reliable product."  The new release also allows sysops to keep a
     demo on their systems which will run for 60 days from install without
     having to download a new time-limited demo every month or so as
     required in the past.

     "As for our existing customers," she added, "we'd really like to
     thank them for their patience and loyalty. Such has gone a long way
     in keeping us working on the product despite opposition which would
     have had us rolling over and giving up long before this." All
     customers entitled to disks (i.e., those who paid for shipping in
     the past) will receive them shortly. FDI requests that 6-8 weeks be
     allowed for receipt since all addresses apparently have to be
     manually re-input after a hard drive crash last year wiped out their
     database.

     Some of the new features include being able to sync your system clock
     to Caller-ID or to another mailer, user-defined semaphores, 80 aka's,
     a brand new configuration program with extensive hypertext help,
     Editor support of several BBS message formats including *.msg,
     Hudson, Goldbase, WildCat 4.x, PCBoard 15.x and more. A nodediff
     processor is now also included.

     Further Development, Inc. can be reached for voice support and orders
     at 954-418-9400. The hours are Monday thru Friday, 11 a.m. to 8 p.m.
     Eastern. The company's Internet E-mail address is fdi@furtherdev.com
