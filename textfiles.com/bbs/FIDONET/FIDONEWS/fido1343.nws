                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================


     When FidoNet began under the sole aegis of the Fido mailer program
     invented by Tom Jennings, things were primitive and simple. So, too,
     were the issues [or lack thereof] concerning daily FidoNet ops or
     FidoNet structure and modus.

     Fido, the program, came to a dead end when Tom Jennings stopped
     working on it. By then, there was Opus and SEAdog and BinkleyTerm and
     FrontDoor and D'Bridge, to name a few, to make what was once just
     simple, unattended file transfers into the Hydra of today's FidoNet
     environment. Fido is still operated by a few hardy souls out there
     but it dead-ended, development-wise, for lack of interest in making
     it more complicated. Opus, SEAdog, and D'Bridge all dead-ended but
     are still in use because of our FidoNet standards.

     Now, we have routing systems and Echomail structures and CRPs and
     BBS interfaces and Internet links that make everything seem more
     complicated. But is it really more complicated or are a lot of folks
     just confused about what FidoNet is and does at the basic level?

     FidoNet is defined by a few published standards and its weekly
     Nodelist. Its glue is this weekly document. None of these things are
     inherently complicated when boiled down for their oil. FidoNet exists:
     1. at the will of its inventor and trademark holder, Tom Jennings;
     2. for the express purpose of providing a lowest common denominator
     means of telecommunicating with a minimum of hardware and software;
     3. as an amateur hobby between consenting practitioners.

     The standards are maintained by an internal group known as the FidoNet
     Technical Standards Committee [FTSC]. This group operates under direct
     license from the trademark holder, Tom Jennings. Only Tom Jennings can
     cause the FTSC to change structure or responsibility.

     The FTSC does NOT create standards nor does it impose standards. The
     FTSC documents existing standards as they become de facto operational
     practices for the majority of FidoNet participants and/or software
     developers. This is something many folks don't understand or never
     knew. The FTSC collects, documents, and publishes standards and
     proposals. It is up the Coordinator structure to enforce those
     standards. It is up to the developers to get their proposals into
     wide acceptance and usage before they become standards. Proposals
     [also known as FSCs] ARE NOT standards. Their implementation is
     strictly voluntary. They become standards only when they become
     indispensable to FidoNet ops.

     There is discussion in several Echos and in these pages about whether
     the FTSC as currently configured is a dead-end. Is FidoNet going
     anywhere from here? Does it need to go somewhere from here? What does
     it take to go somewhere else? Who will be driving this bus to
     somewhere else?

     I invite all the principals to take this discussion to future Issues
     FIDONEWS 13-43               Page 2                   21 Oct 1996


     of FidoNews so all of us can better understand the dynamics and the
     expectations of getting FidoNet where it needs to be.

                                     =======

     On a separate note, I got a message from Debra Turner in the FIDONEWS
     Echo asking if a text description could be included with the comix in
     our ASCII art section so folks using speech synthesizers to peruse
     FidoNews each week could get something out of that visual area. The
     answer was: absolutely! I apologize for not thinking of it. Today's
     comix contain such a description and all subsequent offerings in that
     section will be likewise annotated for the speech program group.

     Speaking of the FIDONEWS Echo, another question came in about how to
     format a message for FidoNews submission. Specifically, he wanted to
     know where the filename specification went in a message to identify
     where the content should go in FidoNews. The answer is: format the
     submission text in the body of the message as closely as possible to
     the ARTSPEC.DOC requirements, i.e. 70 columns, no high ASCII, etc.
     To define what type of submission it is, put the filename as the
     subject line, e.g. Subj: THISISA.JOK. All message submissions are
     manually processed by your Editor to meet the physical requirements
     of MAKENEWS. Including the apparent filename in the Subj: line makes
     it easier for me to determine where you wish your submission to
     appear. If none is included, I guess by the content and give the
     output file an appropriate filename for processing.

     The FIDONEWS Echo is open to all interested in FidoNews subjects and
     operations and is available via your regular Zone 1 Backbone Echo
     links. It is more real-time than FidoNews if you have a question.

                                     *******

     As for the moving saga, who cares? I'm still not completely moved in
     but all the hitches have been standard [late movers, phone company
     foul-ups, utility headaches, etc.] so I'm sure no one cares to have me
     rehash it here. [grin]

     ASCII art and net/computer related humor is slowly starting to trickle
     in from new authors. That's great! Please keep it coming.

     Enough for now. I got a late start today by attending the simultaneous
     birthdays of my daughter and brother [same day, different years,
     similar names {Eric and Erica}] back down in Titusville from whence I
     fled three weeks ago.

     Enjoy!

     C.B.

     More EP2 nonsense
     By Lee Kindness, 2:259/7, lkindnes@csl.co.uk

      BM> As to the practical aspect of a Zone policy why
      BM> don't each of you read Section one of Policy
      BM> 4.07.  Local policies MUST meet certain tests.
      BM> One important one is that they are REQUIRED
      BM> by local conditions.  Not desired, wanted,
      BM> needed etc...but REQUIRED.

     Please, zone 2 policy is the business of zone 2 - not a zone 1 sysop.
     If anything EP2 will be a 'shell' of a policy, allowing policies
     to complement it at a regional level. I'm sure you agree regional
     policies make good common sense in zone 2, each region has it's own
     language for a start.

     Don't base you views on the policy Steve posted to FidoNews. That was
     a very early 'hash' and has been long abandoned.

      BM> Let me poise these questions:

     Well I'll answer them for a zone 2 sysop point of view, nothing
     else... (As i try to figure out what other possible view point i
     have...)

      BM> 1. If the people that "vote" against a Z2 EP ignore
      BM> it ...then what ?

     Depends if the policy is ratified as per EP1. If it is adopted
     then all nodes will be subject to it. I mean just because i don't
     like P4 doesn't mean i can ignore it.

      BM> 2. If those people put in another Z2ep is it anymore
      BM> enforceable then Woodmorepol.

     Bet you're glad I'm not Z2EC, Kindnesspol doesn't have such a
     harsh and evil sound ;)

     If it is:

      1. Submitted before Steve's and ratified as per EP1
      2. Ratified as per replacement conditions is EP2

     Then sure.

      BM> Section one of the existing ratified policy contains
      BM> wisdom.  Since message flow all over the world and
      BM> since any node can link to any other node via any
      BM> way...how do you expect to enforce a policy that
      BM> is limited by geography..as to a technology that
      BM> ISN'T.

     A zone 2 EP would apply to ZONE 2 ECHOES!!! Understand!!!

      BM> Look at the foolishness in Z1.  First there was
      BM> an echopol attempt.  It spent more time on distribution
      BM> then on policy.  It bombed.  Then we had "boppy".  The

     My view is EP should focus more on distribution and technical
     issues rather than 'political' stuff. I mean what is the point of
     all the garbage about removing a moderator if it cannot be enforced?

      BM> OK WHAT IS THE SOLUTION:
      BM> So...Mr. Kindness and Mr. Woodmore.  Instead of brushing
      BM> off an article with childish comments.  Address the

     Good, i said last week - why not fix into ECHOPOL2 and make your views
     count instead of taking cheap shots in FidoNews...

     ECHOPOL2 was originally for the discussion of a zone 2 specific
     echopolicy (and that's still its main aim) but with the Z1EC's
     interest we might well end up with a global (well z1 + z2)
     policy.

     I think we have a broadly similar viewpoint (ie minimum politics
     in Fidonet) but the difference is you're out in the cold shouting
     where no one will take notice, if anything promoting Steve. In
     one of your previous messages you said something about 'zone 2
     flexing it's geographical muscles' - the general consensus in
     ENET.SYSOP, 'about bloody time'...


     Sleep well, and never mind the purple crocus juice.

     A Short *.MSG Programming Tutorial [I]
     Damian Walker, 2:2502/666

     One question which pops up occasionally in programming and technical
     echoes is how to read and/or write netmail messages.  This is one of
     the principal methods of communication in Fidonet, and so it seems a
     logical place to start when applying your programming skills to
     Fidonet for the first time.
         In this tutorial series, I hope to introduce those with moderate
     programming capabilities to the world of Fidonet netmail programming,
     using the *.MSG format (as defined in FTS-1) and the C programming
     language.
         Such knowledge could be used for a variety of purposes; you could
     write a simple netmail robot or other netmail utility.  A while ago,
     someone even wrote a netmail MUD!  In this series I'm not going to be
     nearly as ambitious; a simple netmail directory list utility will
     suffice for our examples.
         As the series goes on you will see some C source code published.
     This source code is in the public domain.  Feel free to use it for
     whatever purpose you wish, whether for commercial, personal or
     educational purposes.  Even Microsoft may use it :-)

         The series is split up as follows:

             Conclusion

     Disclaimer

         Although I will take every precaution to ensure that the
     information in this tutorial is correct, the occasional typo or plain
     stupid mistake might creep in.
         In the event of mangled netmail directories, reformatted hard
     disks, or excessive frustration (with accompanying hair loss)
     resulting from use or misuse of this information, I take absolutely no
     responsibility.

     Introduction to the *.MSG Message Format

         The *.MSG message format is often used for netmail areas,
     principally by those operating FrontDoor-style mailers for their node
     or point.  Users of BinkleyTerm-style mailers often have the option of
     using a *.MSG area for netmail, if their mail processor supports it.
         The format is defined in the document FTS-1, available from a
     large number of sources.  Your local friendly FTSC member should have
     it, and any nearby node could also have it.  Failing that, check the
     Internet sites http://www.fidonet.org or ftp://ftp.fidonet.org, or as
     a last resort, FReq FTS-0001.ARJ from my system (FReq's are welcome,
     but it may be an international call for you).
         Here is a quick run-down.  In the *.MSG format, each message
     occupies a single file, the filename being the message number plus the
     extension '.MSG' (hence the *.MSG name).  Each MSG file contains a
     single header followed by the message text, and 1 ASCII NUL character.
     The header is as follows:

         fromusername    char/36     Sender's name
         tousername      char/36     Recipient's name
         subject         char/72     Subject line
         datetime        char/20     Date/time stamp
         timesread       int/2       Times read
         destnode        int/2       Recipient's node number
         orignode        int/2       Sender's node number
         cost            int/2       Cost word
         orignet         int/2       Sender's net number
         destnet         int/2       Recipient's net number
         destzone        int/2       Recipient's zone number
         origzone        int/2       Sender's zone number
     FIDONEWS 13-43               Page 6                   21 Oct 1996


         destpoint       int/2       Recipient's point number
         origpoint       int/2       Sender's point number
         replyto         int/2       Reply linking information
         attribute       int/2       Attribute word
         nextreply       int/2       Next reply to this message

     Early software implementations lack the zone and point information
     from the header, and some modern implentations have it but don't use
     it.  For the purpose of this tutorial the full structure will be used,
     including zone and point numbers, and technicalities of extracting
     zone and point information from messages which don't use this header
     information will be dealt with later.
         The message text, as defined by FTS-1, doesn't have any limit on
     size.  It must be terminated by an ASCII NUL character (0); some
     software doesn't do this so we'll have to find out how to deal with
     messages from such software later on.
         One aspect of Fidonet messages which impresses me is the fact
     that lines are reformatted in real time by your editor.  A good
     message editor should produce messages in which a whole paragraph
     occupies one line; these paragraphs can be reformatted to suit the
     reader's screen, no matter what font, screen or window size is being
     used.  This is by far preferable to the clumsy reformatting codes used
     by some other systems.
         Paragraphs (or lines in a table) should be terminated by a single
     carriage return (13) character, rather than a line feed or CR/LF pair.
     This standard is not always observed by message editors, especially
     those which use a standard external text editor to input the message
     text-- these message editors often leave the line end markers as they
     are produced by the text editor.
         The message text contains kludge lines.  Although most readers
     will be familiar with kludge lines, I'll give a brief explanation here
     for completeness' sake.  Kludge lines are lines in the message text
     beginning with the ASCII character 1 (^A, often shown as a smiley face
     on MSDOS screens).  Most, if not all, message readers filter these
     lines out of the message display; you won't see them.
         These lines server a number of purposes.  The FMPT and TOPT
     kludges offer point addressing information for messages in which the
     point header information is not used.  The INTL kludge provides a
     similar facility for the zone information, showing both source and
     destination zone addresses.  The MSGID kludge serves to identify a
     message explicitly.
         There are some other kludge lines in use, ranging from the vaguely
     useful to the downright silly.  We need not consider them here.  Now
     for the message header in C.

     If you're using a 32-bit compiler such as DJGPP then you'll have to
     change 'int' to 'short' as all these fields are 16-bit integers. There
     is a more portable way of ensuring that the correct size of integers
     is used no matter what the compiler, involving pairs of 'char'
     variables, but for this tutorial I'll keep things simple. For the
     purposes of later examples, save this definition in a file called
     "fidomsg.h"; I'll refer to it later.

     Reading *.MSG files from the Netmail Directory

         Reading a netmail message is, in theory, a simple task.  If the
     message is fully compliant with the specification, you just open the
     file, read the message header, read the message text, and close the
     file.  A simple function to do that would look like this:

         void readmsg(struct fts1 *msg, char *text, int limit,
             char *filename)
         {
             FILE *msgfile;  /* message file handle info */

             msgfile = fopen(filename, "rb");
             fread(msg, sizeof(struct fts1), 1, msgfile);
             fread(text, 1, limit, msgfile);
             fclose(msgfile);
         }

     Note that there is no error checking in this function at all; a more
     robust function will come later.  Note also that the size of the
     message is limited; a more complex algorithm would be needed to read
     files larger than the maximum buffer you could allocate.  This
     function would be called as in the following example:

         #include <stdio.h>
         #include "fidomsg.h"

         #define MAXMSGSIZE 2048

         /* include the readmsg() function here */

         void main(void)
         {
             struct fts1 msg;
             char text[MAXMSGSIZE];

             readmsg(&msg, text, MAXMSGSIZE, "\\fd\\mail\\1.MSG");
             printf("From: %s (%d/%d)\n", msg.fromusername, msg.orignet,
     FIDONEWS 13-43               Page 8                   21 Oct 1996


                 msg.orignode);
         }

     This program defines the macro MAXMSGSIZE as 2048, meaning that the
     program can deal with messages up to 2k in length.  Real applications
     would probably need to use a bigger buffer, or a more complex
     algorithm for reading large messages as described earlier.
         The program also assumes that the first message in the directory
     will be 1.MSG, so you'll have to make sure that this is in fact the
     case. Alternatively you can modify the program to load another
     message, or to be more useful, allow a message number or file to be
     specified on the command line, like this:

         ...
         void main(int argc, char *argv[])
         ...
             readmsg(&msg, text, MAXMSGSIZE, argv[1]);
         ...

     To make the program more robust you'd have to include some error
     checking to make sure that there is at least one parameter used on the
     command line, but we're drawing away from the main point of the
     article so I'll leave you to figure that one out.

     Finding *.MSG Files in the Netmail Directory

     So far we have a program which will display a few details from a
     single netmail message, as long as the message is 1.MSG or, assuming
     you've experimented with the suggested modifications, as long as we
     know the filename of the message.
         This is a bit useless for our ultimate objective for this
     article-- to list details of messages in the netmail directory.  In
     this task we don't know the message numbers beforehand, and of course,
     we want to list more than a single message.  In solving this task we
     need to obtain a directory listing, and thus we must depart for a
     moment from ANSI standard C; the standard libraries contain no
     functions to perform this platform-specific task.
         For our purposes I have chosen to use the widespread functions
     findfirst() and findnext() defined in the file <dir.h>.  These are
     present in many DOS and UNIX dialects of C, and other dialects may
     have direct equivalents (such as _dos_findfirst() and
     _dos_findnext()).  A cumbersome way to avoid using these is described
     later; it needs a more robust message reading routine before we
     attempt to implement it.
         The function findfirst() takes three parameters-- a character
     array containing a wildcard, a pointer to a structure containing the
     file search information, and an attribute for the search.  The
     findnext() function takes only one parameter-- the pointer to the
     structure used in findfirst().  How would we use these functions to
     get a list of messages in the netmail directory?  Take a look at the
     following example code:

         #include <stdio.h>
         #include <dir.h>

         void main(void)
     FIDONEWS 13-43               Page 9                   21 Oct 1996


         {
             struct ffblk f;
             int done;

             done = findfirst("\\fd\\mail\\*.msg", &f, FA_ARCH);
             while(!done)
             {
                 printf("Found: %s\n", f.ff_name);
                 done = findnext(&f);
             }
         }

     The line containing the call to findfirst() sets up the file search
     parameters-- *.msg files in the \FD\MAIL\ directory, including files
     with the archive bit set (FA_ARCH).  The ff_name member of the f
     variable (see the printf() line) is a simple filename without a path.
     The findnext() line just searches for the next occurrence of the file.
         As you can see, this program will print out the names of the MSG
     files, but it will not reference their contents.  So the program is a
     little useless, although it could be used to verify the existence of
     1.MSG for the earlier example!  To make the program more useful, it
     would have to be combined with earlier examples:

         #include <stdio.h>
         #include <dir.h>
         #include "fidomsg.h"

         #define MAXMSGSIZE 2048

         /* include the readmsg() function here */

         void main(void)
         {
             struct fts1 msg;
             struct ffblk f;
             char text[MAXMSGSIZE], directory[128], wildcard[128],
                  msgname[128];
             int done;

             /* initialise directory and wilcard */
             strcpy(directory, "\\fd\\mail\\");
             sprintf(wildcard, "%s*.msg", directory);

             /* main list output section */
             done = findfirst(wildcard, &f, FA_ARCH);
             while(!done)
             {
                 sprintf(msgname, "%s%s", directory, f.ff_name);
                 readmsg(&msg, text, MAXMSGSIZE, msgname);
                 printf("%-12s From: %s (%d/%d)\n", f.ff_name,
                     msg.fromusername, msg.orignet, msg.orignode);
                 done = findnext(&f);
             }
         }

     Notice here that I've created separate variables for directory,
     FIDONEWS 13-43               Page 10                  21 Oct 1996


     wildcard and individual message filename.  'Wildcard' is needed to
     pass to findfirst(), 'directory' is needed in two places: in the
     creation of 'wildcard' and in the creation of 'msgfile', and 'msgfile'
     is needed to pass to readmsg(), which expects a full filename.
         Since the directory is a constant in these examples, the directory
     name could be included in literal strings, but I've purposely left the
     variable in there so that you can easily modify the program to obtain
     it by other means-- from the command line or a configuration file,
     perhaps.
         As you can see, this is the full program promised at the start of
     this tutorial, which lists details of messages in a netmail directory.
     But the tutorial is far from over, as we haven't considered extracting
     node and point information from the messages.  This will be the
     subject on which next week's article starts.

     Digital Engineering's K-384 ISDN Network Simulator
     Fredric L. Rice (frice@stbbs.com)
     The Skeptic Tank 1:218/890.0 (818) 335-9601

     Lately I've been evaluating the K-384 ISDN Network Simulator
     from Digital Engineering in Ireland and thought that there
     might be some netters who would be interested in this box.
     It's mostly intended for the manufacturer of ISDN equipment
     rather than the end user or the digital hacker yet the fact
     that the puppy will provide three ISDN interfaces and six
     64K Bps data connections also makes this a pretty good kind
     of V.110 synchronous Terminal Adapter.

     The K-384 is an ISDN network simulator, a Terminal Adapter,
     and a protocol analyzer, granting the user insights into all
     of the intimate details of the ISDN protocol stack:  I.430,
     Q.921, Q.931, and all anybody really needs of Q.932.  Since
     there are three ISDN interfaces on this box there can be up
     to six 64K Bps calls up at any one time, pumping data to
     and from the six data connections on the back panel.

     It's not a real Terminal Adapter, however, and it doesn't
     offer asynchronous data out the back panel.  If it did then
     I could ask GTE to bring in three ISDN lines and I could
     run up to six 57,600 baud connections at any one time or, if
     Digital Engineering elected to employ the BONDING protocol
     rather than just V.110 and V.120, I could have up to three
     115,200 baud connections up at any one time.

     I'm going to ask Digital Engineering to think about putting
     these things into their K-384 because doing so would allow
     ISDN equipment manufacturers to test every aspect of their
     devices fully.

     The box itself has some good points and some bad points:

         1) It's easy to use with near plug-and-playability.

            The menus are simple to use and the analyzer offers
            all the information about Layers 1, 2, and 3 that are
            needed.  Clearing the analyzer buffer is quick and
            easy.  Redisplaying the whole buffer upon exiting the
            analyzer and re-entering it is a nice feature as well.

            There is an LED which displays whether or not we have
            Layer 1 and another LED which shows us if we have
            established Layer 2.  The ability to see easily if we
            have Layer 2 established is kind of nice.

         2) The K-384 runs cool and silent.  The power supply that
            I have in my sample box some times puts out a very
     FIDONEWS 13-43               Page 12                  21 Oct 1996


            quiet high frequency whine which at times can be heard
            (other people don't seem able to hear it at all.)

         3) It doesn't appear to support Low-Power Mode / Warm Start
            Mode.  I could just be doing something wrong, of course.

            There is the facility for tearing down Layer 3, Layer 2,
            and Layer 1 after a duration of inactivity yet I haven't
            been able to get it to successfully go into the deactive
            Warm Start state.

         4) It's got bugs.  Some bugs are fatal and some are not.

            a) Unexpected removal of the U-Interface will often cause
            the K-384 to crash, requiring power-cycle.  Some times
            when the cable is quickly disconnected and reconnected,
            the K-384 will buzz, all the B1 and B2 lights will
            flicker, and then the K-384 will restart; configuration
            will be lost.

            b) Calling a B channel which has no physical device
            plugged into it will illuminate the B channel's LED then
            the K-384 will properly return a RELEASE COMPLETE yet
            leave the LED illuminated.  I noticed that this problem
            seems to only exist on Port 2.

            c) At power-up, there are times when I continue to send
            ID_REQUESTs to the K-384 and the K-384 will ignore
            them.  Shifting the cable to the other U-Interface
            connector on the K-384 fixes the problem.  For example,
            there are times when I talk into Port 3 of the K-384
            and send dozens of ID_REQUESTs to the K-384 which will
            ignores them.  Moving the cable from Port 3 to Port 2
            makes the device perform a Layer 1 LinkUp thereafter
            the K-384 responds properly to the ID_REQUEST on Port
            2.  Swapping the cable back to Port 3 fixes the problem
            on Port 3 since it will start to respond to the
            ID_REQUESTs.

            e) The "Analyzer Setup" menu contains a date/time stamp
            that is constantly updated.  It messes up the screen.

            While in the "Analyzer Setup" menu, using the arrow keys
            to traverse the menu causes the date/time stamp that's
            constantly being displayed to be written over the wrong
            line on the display.  Though it's a minor glitch, I
            tried all the different terminal emulations Procomm Plus
            has and the ANSI emulators all exhibited the same
            glitch.

            f) Output from the K384 will send both CR/LF pairs as
            well as isolated CRs.  This is sloppy... very sloppy.

            For example, we'll see 0D 0A 0D 0D 0A 0D in the
            following.  Text which follows a 0D can over-write the
            previous line when the log file is sent to the printer.

     So there are some software issues that Digital Engineering
     needs to work out of their K-384 before I would buy it.  I
     pulled the cover off their box to check the manufacturing
     side of things and noticed that the box I'm using has version
     "V1.2 LX," whatever that is.

     As for the mechanics and the workmanship of the box there
     are also some good things and bad things.

     First off it took 14 sheet-metal screws to remove the top
     lid.  This is damned good because it gives the construction
     of the box a great deal of strength.  Because the lid rests
     upon a metal strip along the front and is tied together
     with 14 screws, I don't have any moral compunctions against
     stacking heavy equipment on top of it.  I would probably
     keep the power-supply air vents uncovered, of course.

     The metal strip along the front that the top lid rests upon
     has a black plastic strip along its entire length giving it
     a good, solid vibration killer.  There's no metal-to-metal
     interface tending to grind together when installed in a
     test environment.

     Lifting the lid off the first thing I noticed was the modular
     design.  If I want any combination of U-Interfaces and
     S/T-Interfaced, all that Digital Engineering has to do is
     pop in a small module onto their primary board and then ship
     it to me.  If I want to change the configuration of the
     hardware interfaces in the field, all I need to do is pull
     out one screw, unplug the module, and plug the new one in.

     Whoever designed this piece of the product did a damn good
     job.  The through-hole on the screw is oblate allowing for a
     good degree of travel side to side if the machining of the
     container is not exactly the same every time.  In so many
     other products I've looked inside of there is usually only
     a single screw hole -- circular -- and if the jack on a panel
     doesn't exactly match-up with the cover plate, something must
     be bent to make it line up.  This design is superior in that
     the screw hole travels until there is a mechanical alignment
     and then the screw is tightened down; no bending required.
     FIDONEWS 13-43               Page 14                  21 Oct 1996


     They're using the Mitel MT8910AC for the U-Interface and the
     Mitel MT8930BE for the S/T-Interface, I noticed.  I would
     prefer that they had used Motorola's U-Interfaces simply
     because I'm biased in favor of Motorola products but these
     Mitel products are solid and reliable.  All the other digital
     components are manufactured in Malaysia.

     The power supply is also a good design.  I can't tell if
     Digital Engineering buys this power supply from someone else
     and installs it in their K-384 or whether they go ahead and
     manufacturer it in-house.  No, I unsoldered some components
     next to its transformer and see that the power supply was
     manufactured in Japan.  'Makes good financial sense.

     Another thing I noticed while looking for who made the power
     supply was the fact that there is a space for the main board's
     serial number but that it's blank.  There is a serial number
     on the outside on a sticker but I wonder how Digital
     Engineering tracks boards if they don't put serial numbers on
     them.  The sticker is easily removed so I could easily cheat
     on my warranty, I think.

     Bar far the worse thing about the workmanship is the
     outrageous number of through-holes and component pins that
     simply don't have enough solder in them or, in many of the
     components toward the front of the box, just don't have _any_
     solder in them at all.  This may be the cause of some of the
     unexplainable crashes I've been experiencing.  It looks like
     the wave-solder process just did a bad job.  Every hole should
     be filled entirely and every pin should be soldered down, of
     course.

     Just stepping through traces and pins and such with a
     continuity tester shows me that all of the pins that are not
     soldered onto the board nonetheless have connectivity but
     with a little probe tip pressure I can make some of the pins
     break contact with their etches.  If I were sitting on a work
     bench with hardware grunts working on it, I could expect to
     have some of these pins fail.  I'm guessing that because the
     unsoldered pins normally have continuity with their etches,
     it's why this particular box managed to make it through their
     quality control.

     The only other poorly done workmanship about this particular
     box is the front-end components driving the data ports on the
     back panel.  It looks like there might have been some
     component failures and so new components were manually placed
     on the board to replace them.  The surface mounted components
     are in okay and everything works yet there are tiny peaks of
     solder on most of the manually-soldered pins.  It's not the
     smooth slope that I'm used to seeing.

     The only other thing worth mentioning is the manual.  In a
     word, it isn't.  A manual, I mean.  It's more like a reference
     book for some of the major aspects of the device.  There is a
     PCMCIA interface and a PCMCIA ROM/FLASH card which came with
     FIDONEWS 13-43               Page 15                  21 Oct 1996


     my K-384 which I have no idea what to do with it.  The PCMCIA
     connector is a good one -- it has an ejector lever and it's
     firmly mounted -- no play; doesn't wiggle like so many other
     PCMCIA designs I've seen.  But the manual doesn't give me any
     clues.

     The AT commands, come to think of it, aren't enough for me
     to utterly control the box remotely.  I would also ask Digital
     Engineering to give me more control over configuration and
     control through the AT command set.  I would think about
     writing a Windows GUI interface for the K-384 eventually but
     as it stands now, I don't have enough remote control hooks
     to get inside the box's brain.

     My overall summation of the Digital Engineering K-384 Network
     Simulator is that I would like to personally own a couple.  I
     like the box.  I wouldn't even mind actually paying for them
     if I were doing ISDN related hardware or software development.
     Before I would spend my own personal money on one, though, I
     would require them to solve their software problems and their
     solder-wave process problems first.  If they did that I would
     also ask that they employ the V.120 Rate Adaptation Protocol
     so that I could do asynchronous out the back and _really_ test
     all of my hardware and software designs.  Then I would expect
     a proper manual.  After that then I could run six high-speed
     links to The Skeptic Tank -- some to my Unix box and some
     to the DOS box.

     This company, by the way, has been most helpful in answering
     my questions.  Even though I asked some difficult technical
     questions they managed to locate someone with the background
     and knowledge to answer my questions.

     I have no idea what my company pays for these boxes.  Being a
     software dink I don't have to worry about such things.  It's
     great just being able to ask for equipment and not give a damn
     about the cost.  Someone said that the cost was around $5,000
     but he wasn't sure.  There is also a 16-interface version of
     this Network Simulator which I'm going to ask for eventually.
     Before I would put 16 ISDN lines into my house, though, I
     would just as soon have GTE bring in a T1 / E1 span and be
     done with it.  Ascend in Alameda, California, would probably
     be my T1 equipment supplier of choice.

     Region 13 fun and games

     By Joe Klemmer - 1:109/370
     klemmerj@webtrek.com


     This will be short and to the point -

     The RC screwed up by not renewing the Elistings for the R13 echos.

     Bob Moravsik then did what is perfectly proper by Elisting the echos
     himself.

     The REC then created new R13 echos to supersede the old ones.  Again,
     a perfectly proper thing to do.

     Final outcome: The old echos are no longer part of the R13 regional
     distribution and can be whatever the moderator wants them to be.
     They are not "official" (whatever that is) R13 echos so whatever
     happens in them means nothing to the region.

        See?  As I said, short and simple.  Phil Dampier screwed the pooch;
     Bob Moravsik did what he does best; the region adapted to correct the
     situation; the problem is non-existent.  To make more of it is a waste
     of time and effort and only serves to cause trouble for no reason.

     Hello Ward.

     There has been no Zone 2 updates in the Zone 1 NodeList for over 3
     months.

     All problems with other zones seem to be fixed, including Zone 3
     (which passes through your own system on it way here) and Zone 6.  In
     Zone 1, the only remaining problem is with Zone 2 updates.

     Some New Telephone Options
     by August Abolins, [a.abolins@ieee.ca, 1:253/60]

     (The following was found on another FTN-based echo system.  The
     posting did not indicate any credits to an original author. I have
     forwared it here as it was originally posted in the echo.)

     With the myriad of telephone "services" now so widely available, two
     of which are actually useful <g> I present to you one interpretation
     of the madness.   ..AA
                                     -=-

     Would the invention of the telephone ever have gotten off the ground
     if Alexander Graham Bell's first call had gone ...

     Bell:  Mr. Watson, come here; I want you. Voice: If you know Watson's
     extension, press 1 now. If you would like to leave a message for
     Watson, press 2 now ...

     The telephone, which was satisfied for a century or so simply
     placing and receiving calls, has become a different animal in recent
     years. These days everybody has an answering machine, a speakerphone,
     and a slew of other telecommunication doodads. Call waiting, Caller
     ID, and last number redial are fine, but here are some options that
     can't be far behind:

     ON-HOLD DISRUPT. When someone puts you on hold for more than 15
     seconds, a digitized voice blares over their speakerphone, "Hey!
     Remember me? I don't have all day!" This option also shorts out Muzak
     if it's being played.

     CALL SCHMOOZING. Stuck listening to a long-winded acquaintance? Call
     Schmoozing activates a speech-synthesized voice that sounds just like
     you and repeats, "Uh-huh ... I see ... right" while the other party
     babbles on. They think you're hanging on every word, when you're
     actually getting some work done.

     CALL SCHMOOZING PLUS. Your phone places call to important contacts,
     trades pleasantries, probes for career-enhancing information, and ends
     by saying, "You're beautiful. Let's do lunch. Don't ever change."

     GOSSIP NOTIFICATION. Company rumors are automatically broadcast to
     selected voice mailboxes. Time once wasted circulating gossip
     translates into increased productivity.

     CALL TERMINATE. Imagine being able to fire troublesome employees just
     by dialing their numbers! An excellent feature for executives with
     poor confrontation skills.

     NETWORK EAVESDROP. A must for the paranoid manager. Whenever anyone in
     the company mentions your name during a phone conversation, a voice-
     FIDONEWS 13-43               Page 21                  21 Oct 1996


     activated tape recorder stores the call so you can review it later and
     hear what people say about you.

     SELECTIVE CALL DISCOURAGING. Program the numbers of people you
     _really_ don't want to speak with. When they dial your number, your
     phone transmits a mild electric shock through their receivers.

     CELLULAR CRANK CALL. On command, your car phone can dial any other car
     phone within a 30-mile radius and tell the driver his muffler looks as
     though it's about to fall off.

     CALL REMINDING. Store the birthdays and anniversaries of loved ones in
     your telephone's memory. On the appropriate days, the phone
     automatically calls them and relays heartfelt sentiments in a
     digitized voice resembling yours.

     CALL INTERRUPT. When you need to end a conversation quickly, a button
     on your phone causes a fake operator to break in and announce that you
     have an emergency call on the line from Steve Jobs.

     SUBLIMINA-CALL. Periodically during a conversation, the phone plays
     subliminal messages to the other party, such as "Say yes" and
     "Increase my department's budget."

     CHARGE FORWARDING. A quick push of a button charges any long-distance
     call to the person you're calling or to friends who don't look too
     closely at their phone bills.

      Route placidly amid channel noise and network failures,
      And remember what throughput there may be in executing all alone.

      As far as possible, without overflowing buffer
      Be on communicative terms with all processes.
      Broadcast your data quietly and clearly
      And listen(2) to others.
      Even to the null and the unreachable,
      They too have their requests.
      Avoid long and argumentative sessions
      They are burdensome to the ether.

      If you compare your priority with others'
      You may become vain or bitter
      For always there will be greater and lesser processes than yourself.

      Enjoy your CPUtime as well as your idletime.
      Keep cognizance of your portmapper, however low-level
      It is a constant port in the changing mappings of the network.

      Exercise caution in your execution,
      For the kernel is full of traps.
      But let this not blind you to what swap space there is;
      Many channels strive for high bandwidths, and everywhere
      Computing is full of parallelism.

      Be yourself.  (Check with getpid(2) frequently)
      Especially do not forge NFS file handles.
      Neither be cynical about sockets,
      For in the face of all congestion and delays
      They are as powerful as STREAMS.

      Take kindly the influx of new requests,
      Gracefully re-prioritizing the older ones.

      Nurture support of check-points to rollback from sudden crashes
      But do not thrash pages due to imagined pagefaults:
      Many core dumps are born of bus error or segmentation faults.

      Beyond a nominal consideration,
      Be nice(1) to other processes.

      You are a child in the kernel space
      No less than the daemons and the device drivers,
      You have a right to execute here.
      And whether or not it is apparent to you
      No doubt the kernel is crashing, though it shouldn't.

      Therefore be at peace with your programmer
      However geeky you think s/he is.
      And wherever your read(2)'s and recvfrom(2)'s,
      In the noisy communication channels of the network,
      Keep a valid (void *) buf available in your address space.
      With all its stopped jobs, missing arguments and broken pipes,
      It is still a UNIX shell.

      Strive to be up and running always.

                           QUESTION OF THE WEEK
     =================================================================


     I am aware that there are folks out there reading FidoNews with speech
     programs. I know these programs are also used for Netmail and
     Echomail.

     The Question of the Week is who uses these programs, what programs are
     in use, and are any of these functions available inside mailers or
     BBS or editor programs?

     Please send responses as articles, Netmail, Echomail in the FIDONEWS
     Echo, or email to our Internet address. See the Masthead information
     at the end of each Issue of FidoNews for contact info.

     Thanks.

     Latest Greatest Software Versions
     by Peter E. Popovich, 1:363/264

     Amazingly enough, I'm still pretty much caught up. If you've sent
     anything in that you haven't heard back on, it was probably eaten
     up by the routed mail goblin; please resend it.

     One note: Upon request, I've changed the contact for Maximus & Squish
     from Gary Gilmore to "Tech" at 1:249/106. Scott Dudley really wishes
     I listed internet information in the list, but I don't. I will however
     give him a plug this week: http://www.lanius.com.

     Phased out this week: Apple II Software

     Phase-out highlights:
       This week: QNX Software Deadline for info: 1 Nov 1996.
       Last week: Archimedes Software Deadline for info: 25 Oct 1996.
