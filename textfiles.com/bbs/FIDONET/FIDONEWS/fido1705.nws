     Fidonews welcomes Frank Vest as the newest staff member.  In his
     article this week, he's "not promising that this will be a regular
     thing..." which clearly indicates that he's hooked now :)
     
     Thanks to all the contributors this week for an outstanding issue!

                             Freedom of the Press
                                  Doug Myers

     This week's editorial was inspired by Ross Cassell's guest
     editorial.  But let me make it clear that I don't think that Ross
     seeks to abridge the principle of a Free Press.  Nor is it a proper
     response to Ross's editorial; for what it's worth, I mostly agree
     with him.  Rather, it's an attempt on my part to explain to the
     readers here how I view the concept of Freedom of the Press, and why
     such freedom might be extended to the clearly unpopular views of
     Charles Hunter (apparently the real name of "Mike," who complains of
     persecution at the hands of Fidonet).

     The principle of Freedom of the Press has never, despite some
     opinion to the contrary, guaranteed the right of anyone to say
     anything they like in a publication.  In countries where Freedom of
     the Press is a strong tradition, you will still find publications
     which are selective in what they publish.  One wouldn't expect to
     have an article advocating increased military spending in "the
     liberal press," nor an article advocating increased social services
     in a "conservative newsletter."  Nor anything not mentioning pigs in
     Doc Logger's cherished Swine Herders' Weekly.

     Freedom of the Press is traditionally interpreted to mean that
     private publications are free from government control.

     This distinction is blurred in Fidonet because Fidonews was started
     by that private organization's founder at a time when he considered
     Fidonet to be without any form of government.  Though the
     Coordinator structure has evolved (not without argument) into a
     governing structure since that time, I don't think that there's ever
     been an effort to control the contents of Fidonews.  Shall we say
     that Freedom of the Press is a strong tradition in Fidonet?

     So recently your editor finds in his email an article by Charles
     Hunter, claiming persecution at the hands of Fidonet.  Does he
     strike your editor as one who's story simply must be heard, either
     because it has merit or because the free press nature of Fidonews
     demands that it be printed?  Or should the article be rejected
     because the author is not a Fidonet sysop or because the point of
     view might upset some?

     Actually, neither extreme determined publication or rejection of the
     article.  Certainly, I didn't think that Charles (or "Mike" or
     whatever) had a strong argument, and his tendency towards legal
     threats predisposed me to just delete the message to begin with.
     Nor did I consider whether he was a Fidonet sysop or not - I feel
     there are many who are not sysops who make positive contributions to
     Fidonet, and this publication is for them also.

     So why did he get published?  Well, it was a slow day for news...
     FIDONEWS 17-05               Page 2                   31 Jan 2000


     ... and I did consider that there was some content of interest to
     Fidonews readers.  Like it or not, the expectation that the Sysops
     and Moderators of Fidonet should control what's posted here is
     strong with many, and should be vocalized from time to time... if
     only to repudiate the notion.

     Had I rejected Charles article, it would have been over his legal
     threats, as I don't believe Freedom of the Press involves inviting
     lawsuits.  However, I didn't reject Charles article mostly because I
     _do_ believe that my own personal opinion of a point of view
     shouldn't weigh on it's acceptance; because I didn't consider his
     lawsuit talk to be an immediate threat; and mostly because his own
     words expose the fanaticism behind them.

     So here's Charles (or "Mike" or whomever) having his brief fling on
     the stump.  I ask the readers to hear him out, because I believe his
     own words damn him to rejection more firmly than any editorial
     suppression I could justify.

              If you cant take the heat, stay out of the kitchen
              ==================================================

     In a recent issue of Fidonews, our esteemed editor allowed a
     non-Fidonet person to submit an article to air a greviance regarding
     his treatment in a Fidonet Message Echo. This persons name is
     Charles Hunter, any Fidonet sysop whom has lurked around the
     ABORTION, HOLYSMOKE or ASAKACOP echoes knows all to well what
     Charles temprament is like.

     While the situation has grown deeper since its inception, most of
     this started over Charles Hunter objecting to an email address
     another user posted within the signature line of this users
     messages. Charles being to whatever degree, 'religious', literally
     was having a fit in the ABORTION echo over Steve Kemps Email address
     which was or is: jesusonacid@yahoo.com. As I said, it was giving
     Charles fits, eventually the echo moderator clamped down, but not
     before enough anomosity between them two existed for it to spill
     over into other echoes and then compound itself from that point
     onwards.

     User or Sysop, Charles simply could have used his next key or a twit
     filter if he felt that strong that an email addy such as it was was
     going to destroy the existence of his LORD and SAVIOR if it fell
     upon his eyes.

     Charles earned himself a lifetime ban from the ABORTION echo for
     various comments made to the then moderator, which included lawsuit
     threats, of course since the ban, the former moderator, current
     moderator and Steve Kemp have been threatened with a lawsuit.

     Now he is whining about how he was or is being treated in the
     HOLYSMOKE echo.. Anyone being in FIDONET for any length of time
     knows this echo is a free for all like say FLAME or similiar type
     echoes. Charles Hunter willingly followed Steve Kemp into this echo
     and now is crying foul.

     Charles should have removed himself from those areas that are now
     distressing him. He is his own best worst enemy.

     Throughout this entire scene, this sysop admits ganging up on him in
     this echo, to show how stupid he is behaving. Charles has been
     threatening everyone with lawsuits, he has even been threatening the
     very sysops that give him access to Fidonet with lawsuits. When I
     told him that I was going to suggest to these sysops that they
     consider banning him to protect their interests, he sent me a email
     threatening me with a lawsuit.

     We wont talk about how he doesnt have a solitary case for one and we
     certainly wont talk about his incompetence in operating his mail
     reader. Like we really need to see the same message from him 4 times
     FIDONEWS 17-05               Page 4                   31 Jan 2000


     or seeing messages he addresses to himself?

     This sysop believes that Fidonews is not the proper forum for a
     non-Fidonet person to address a grievance even if the grievance is
     frivolous? Charles Hunters avenues for greviance lies with the
     conference moderators and the sysops of the BBS's he uses, those
     sysops can make a presentation to the snooze on his behalf if they
     so choose. Furthermore Charles doesnt own the machines that run the
     BBS's he uses, the sysops whom run these BBS's do so at their
     pleasure for sake of a hobby and not to only serve Charles
     interests. There is no room in this hobby for anyone whom wants to
     threaten legal action everytime someone says 'boo'!

     Actually, the complained of messages have very little to do with the
     subject matter of the Abortion conference.  A poster to that
     conference, with a reportedly long history of being harassing, and
     annoying in various conferences in Fidonet was using a addy in his
     messages that stated: mailto:jesusonacid@yahoo.com which does not
     appear to be a n actual email addres.  It is irrelevant anyway
     whether it is an actual email address. Admittedly, there was little
     I could do about him posting that email address in messages to all
     or others.  However, because he knew that the email address was
     offensive to me to the point of intentionally inflicting emotional
     distress he set out upon a campaign to harass me generally and in
     FIDONEWS 17-05               Page 6                   31 Jan 2000


     the religious sense by sending numerous repeated messages to me
     containing that awful email address; and he did so in total
     disregard of my demands that he cease and desist claiming a "free
     speech" right to do so.

     He then moved to the Bible conference where he was told that his
     messages which contained such offensive terms were not welcome.  He
     then moved to the HolySmoke conference where I have never been a
     participant.  There he started to post defamatory and untrue
     statements about me.  I posted a warning and defense telling him to
     stop posting untrue, defamatory, harassing messages to or about me
     and he set out to assault me with repeated, vulgar, religiously
     harassing and harassing, defamatory/slanderous/libelous messages
     directed to my address and posted in the international conference
     known as "holysmoke".  Many of his freinds joined in with equally
     offensive comments and messages.

     The incidents above have nothing to do with "rational public
     discussion" and everything to do with the posting of messages with
     no value other than religious harassment, harassment,
     defamation/slander/libel in the face of a demand to the writers,
     moderators, zone managers that they cease and desist.  In other
     words, FidoNet was put on NOTICE of these improper messages and at
     that point had a duty to take action to stop/control such messages.
     In addition, I posted several civil and criminal statutes which
     clearly demonstrated the liability of the posters, the sysops and
     Fidonet.

     The initial attacks on me were not brought on by me unless you want
     to consider a simple request that someone not post to or about me
     with religiously harassing statements or addys.  I did not go to
     Holysmoke to participate.  I went there only to defend myself once I
     was made aware that false, defamatory/slanderous/libeous statements
     were being made about me.

     That may be considered weak in terms of how Fidonet views these
     matters; but it is NOT weak in terms of the law or common decency.
     Why Fidonet would want to condone a conference like HolySmoke is
     beyond me; but that's not my gripe.  My gripe is that unscrupled
     people can enter the conference and being posting clearly tortious
     FIDONEWS 17-05               Page 7                   31 Jan 2000


     and illegal messages about me without any action from Fidonet or
     it's personnel, sysops.  Likewise when a similarly vulgar zone
     coordinator can post similar messages about me and incite others to
     post messages (along with his own)  to my sysops to get my access
     cut.  By the way, I have just been informed by my main BBS sysop
     that if I get booted from one more conference he is going to cut my
     access.

     Controlling one's own reaction to Offense?  To outright religious
     harassment, harassment, slander, libel, defamation in conferences
     that I did not elect to participate in?  I think not.  These matters
     are not "anything".  They constitute violations of law, which even
     in the light of the current laws create clear legal liability on the
     part of Fidonet and it's sysops.  Even the immunity afforded
     newspapers and broadcasters does not apply when the said newspapers
     and broadcasters were made aware of the defamation and continued to
     publish/broadcast it.

     How does someone go out of his way to be offended?  Am I expected to
     allow someone to defame/libel/slander me in an international echo? I
     think not.  Do I have to be harassed and religiously harassed?  I
     think not.

     This is not a case of bluff or bravado.  The legal actions are
     already being put into motion; and whether Fidonet becomes involved
     depends upon how and when Fidonet handles the present situation.

     Single Out someone and expose them to harassment and religious
     harassment, defamation/slander/libel is supposed to be a pastime? I
     think not.  As far as the moderator or sysop, they are subject to
     the laws of the state and the United States and civil and criminal
     liability.

     So be it.  However, I do think I CAN muster the state and federal
     judicial and law enforcement systems behind me.  Sorry to be that
     blunt; but it would appear that you are merely echoing the pervasive
     attitude in Fidonet that lets problems like this arise when a
     vulgar, unscrupled atheist or satanist decides to have some fun
     attacking other people because of their religious beliefs.

     ---------------

     Editor:  You're not being blunt - you're being unreasonable.  You're
     expecting me to embrace your cause and stop those who would speak
     against you while at the same time threatening legal action.  I see
     no reason to further discuss this with you and possibly give you
     something for your attornies to mull over.  Have a nice life.

                          Is There Support for MAC?
                        Email from Miroslav Ambrus-Kis
                  <miroslav.ambrus-kis@vecernji-list.tel.hr>

     Pardon for appearence :-)

     Seems that Fidonet ozrganization is supporting some abandoned
     platforms like Atari and Amiga, but doesn't support some living -
     like Macintosh is!

     Is it only about a (mis)perception, or Macintosh users - unlike
     myself - do not care, or even don't suffer the nostalgia about Fido?

     These (possibly boring?) remarks are only because an exhaustive
     search for up-to-date Macintosh OLR software gave me the only usefult
     information: your mail address.

     Please, give me at least some hints or URL-s for connection between
     Macintosh and Fidonet based BBS sofware.

     Sorry to bother...

     ---------------

     Editor:  You're no bother :)  Unfortunately, I have no personal
     knowledge of Macintosh software availability, but maybe one of the
     readers of Fidonet does.

     "Case against Fidonet is clearly weak" is simply not strong enough
     language for dealing with this.  First off,  it's been fairly well
     established in legal opinion that there are two ways to go with this
     sort of a communications medium.

     The first one is to provide for the movement of information,
     whether it be messages or files or whatever not being particularly
     relevant,  without exercising much if any say in terms of the
     content.  I could be a little off on this but I believe that this
     makes one a "common carrier".

     The other approach is to maintain control over content,  and the
     legal aspect of this that's probably of most concern to sysops is
     that this makes you in effect a "publisher",  and puts you in the
     position of being completely liable for _ALL_ content on your
     system.

     I don't know about most sysops,  but I carry a fair number of echos
     here,  some of which seem to run very high in volume,  and I don't
     read all of these echos, but have them here in terms of stuff that
     callers might be interested in. There's simply no way I'd have the
     time to do so,  I have a hard enough time keeping up with the stuff
     I want to read!  :-)

     The other aspect of this that I have a LARGE problem with is the
     threat of legal action.  I remember one incident in another net not
     all that long ago where somebody did something similar.  And there
     was no way in hell I'd ever want to associate with somebody who
     would do such a thing.  In fact,  that particular individual
     actually called my BBS and addressed this issue,  at which point I
     simply told them that they'd crossed a line there and that there was
     no way they were ever going to un-do what they'd done.

     I have no downlinks for fido at this point in time,  but if I did,
     there's no way that I would care to feed anybody who would express
     such a point of view. Do others feel differently about that?  Is the
     person who's feeding this guy willing to assume that kind of
     liability?

     This is a HOBBY!  And I have absolutely no obligation to deal with
     people who would resort to such a threat,  much less such tactics.
     Nor do they have any "rights" when it comes to feeding from my

     system.

      FR> If the decline of Fidonet is predicated on Sysops and
      FR> Moderators controlling messages to the extent of not offending
      FR> anyone, then we may as well throw in the towel now.  Folks can

      his way to be offended?

     When I last encountered an individual who,  for whatever reasons,
     found my posts in a certain (technical) echo to be objectionable,
     though the moderator and other participants in that echo didn't,  I
     suggested to him,  after seeing complaints by him to the moderator,
     that if he really didn't like the way that the echo was run he
     should start his own.  So he did.  I have no idea how it's doing,  I
     don't carry it here,  nor do I participate in it,  but he's
     presumably less unhappy than he was before.

     Isn't that the way it's supposed to work?  You don't like something
     that's happening,  you "vote with your feet"...?

      FR> Threatening legal action is the lowest form of echo behavior,

      FR> nor practical and, as such, is only intended as bluff and

     Maybe.

      FR> However, it's the biggest conversation killer around.  What
      FR> echo participant would want to cope with legal action over
      FR> conversations which are supposed to be a pastime?  Defending

     Also agreed.  It's in effect somebody's way of saying "I can't deal
     with you directly, so I'm gonna beat you up with my attorney..."

     Protocols or Communications?
     David Hallford 1:211/103

     I believe that we are at a crossroads in Fidonet. Which way we turn
     will decide Fidonets future.

     Are we a network about communications or one about protocols? The
     debate rages in some areas. IP only nodes and email only nodes - can
     they be members of Fidonet?

     The technical standards are fairly clear - If a node flys the IBN
     flag and I want to communicate directly with him I need to run BINKD
     or ARGUS, if the node flys the ITX flag I need to run TransX. Or
     route the netmail to them.

     Or should I say that they should run the software that can
     communicate with the software I run? What if they really don't have
     a need to communicate directly with me? Should I require that they
     run software so that *I* can communicate with them if I so desire?
     Am I that self-centered? Am I willing to deny Fidonet Membership to
     someone because I don't want to have to buy another program when I
     can make them buy one?

     What is the important issue? The protocol? Or Fidonet?

     Who really makes this decision? The Coordinator structure does,if
     they allow IP only and email only nodes in the nodelist or not .
     Many do. I would like to see the ZC's get together and formalize
     this policy. There's only 6 of them with the IC as a chairman so
     it should be easy for them to reach a consensus.

     To assist them : I am an email only node. I run TransX and have no
     phone number in the nodelist. Let the ZCC get together and vote on
     whether I should be removed from the nodelist or not. This will at
     least clear up the email only node question.

     If I disappear from the nodelist you will know that the answer was
     "No", but at least Fidonet will have an answer.

     Just in case - It's been great being a member of Fidonet. I love the
     folks I've met.(physically and electronically) (Yes Roy, this
     includes you) and I've had a blast. I've enjoyed each step of the
     way and I have learned a lot.

                             This weeks Web Page
                                By Frank Vest

     Well, I could start with my page, or my Net or Region's page. Naw...
     that'd be too bogus of me. :)


                    This weeks page is the Region 12 page.

     Why?  It's good.
     Where? http://sparkys.dyndns.org/

                                What's it got?

     Yup, this is the good part. :)

     The main page starts out by announcing that it is Fidonet Region 12.
     The background is white, covered in a light grey scrip that reads
     "Fidonet Region 12". There's an animated "Fidonet" spinning and a
     Canadian flag "flying in the breeze". Love the dog on the opposite
     side of the page. :)

     Just below is a link to an article that appeared in a recent
     Fidonews. Then you come to the "meat" of the page. There are links
     to R12 News, Fidonews, Files, Fidonet links and telnet links. Of
     course, there's a "Guest Book" as well (gotta get me one of those.
     :) There's an E-Mail address to the R12C and R12EC also. The page is
     also a member of a "Web Ring" and has the banner for that.

     The one thing that stands out to me is the Net BBS Lists for the
     Region. The time was taken to make a list for each Net in the
     Region. Each Net is listed and linked to a page that shows the "BBS
     List" for that Net. You'll find them just below the E-Mail addresses
     for the RC and REC. Along side the Net BBS Lists are links to some
     Fidonet articles of interest.

     I did notice that the "Hit Counter" is a little low. :(  Of course,
     you readers of this article can fix that, right? <G>

     All in all, this is a nice page. Informative without being cramped.
     Please check it out.

             wdbonner@pacbell.net

     A lil' poem, author unknown, slightly reworded to
     be apropos to today's foreboding naysayers...

     HOW DO YOU LIVE YOUR FIDO-NET DASH?

     I read of a man who stood to speak
     At the funeral of his dear friend, Fido.
     He referred to the dates on a head-stone
     of Fido from the beginning...to the end.

     He noted that first came Fido's date of birth
     And spoke the following date with tears,
     But he said what mattered most of all
     Was the DASH between those years (1984 - 2000)

     For that little DASH represents all the time
     That Fido has spent alive on earth...
     And now only those who loved Fido
     Know what that little DASH is worth.

     For it matters not, how much we own
     The cars...the house...the cash,
     What matters is how we live and love
     And how we communicate with our DASH.

     So think about this long and hard...
     Are there things you'd like to change?
     For you never know how much time is left,
     That can still successfully be rearranged.

     If we could just slow down enough
     To consider what's true and real,
     And always try to understand
     The way other people feel.

     And be less quick to anger,
     And show appreciation more
     And love the people in our lives
     Like we've never loved before.

     If we treat each other with respect,
     And more often wear a smile..
     Remembering that this special DASH
     Might only last a little while.

     So, when YOUR eulogy's being read
     With your life's actions to rehash...
     Would you be PROUD of the things they say

       Larry's barn burned down and his wife, Susan, called the insurance
       company.

       Susan told the insurance company, "We had that barn insured for
       fifty thousand and I want my money."

       The agent replied, "Whoa there, just a minute, Susan. Insurance
       doesn't work quite like that. We will ascertain the value of what
       was insured and provide you with a new one of comparable worth."

       There was a long pause before Susan replied, "Then I'd like to
       cancel the policy on my husband."

     It's the spring of 1957 and Bobby, a pretty hip guy with his own
     car, goes to pick up his date. When he goes to the front door, the
     girl's father answers and invites him in. "Carrie's not ready yet,
     so why don't you have a seat?" he says.

     "That's cool," says Bobby. Carrie's father asks Bobby what they're
     planning to do. Bobby replies politely that they will probably just
     go to the soda shop or a movie.

     Carrie's father responds, "Why don't you two go out and screw?  I
     hear all the kids are doing it."

     Naturally, this comes as quite a surprise to Bobby, so he asks
     Carrie's dad to repeat it. "Oh yeah," says Carries father, "our
     Carrie really loves to screw.  She'd screw all night if we'd let
     her!"  Well, this makes Bobby's eyes light up, and his plan for the
     evening is beginning to look pretty good.

     A few minutes later, Carrie comes downstairs in her little poodle
     skirt and announces that she's ready to go.  Almost breathless with
     anticipation, Bobby escorts his date out the front door.

     About 20 minutes later, Carrie rushes back into the house, slams the
     door behind her, and screams at her father: "DAMN IT, DADDY! IT'S
     CALLED THE TWIST!!!"

     a @ preceding an individual's name implies a virtual email
     address. The email is translated as follows
     firstlast@osirusoft.com will automatically route to the
     appropriate individual's email.  Anyone in this list will
     also receive routed notice of this feature.  In my case, it
     would still be joejared@osirusoft.com, but you get the idea.

     Also, as information is provided to me, I will be adding a
     latency field to each node, which is defined as the maximum
     time between when the message is received, and when it is
     sent on to other nodes, or available to be sent onward,
     defined in minutes. A latency of ! implies that there is an
     immediate response, and an attempt to deliver immediately
     after processing, or a "MinuteMail System", as it were.

                       Fidonews Index for 2000 (so far)

     Included in the Fidonews archive with this issue are Index files for
     1998 and 1999.  They're a little too big to be included in the
     Snooze itself, so I've included the index generated for the year
     2000 so far... as a sample.  Note that the second issue of Fidonews
     this year was incorrectly labeled Volume 18.
