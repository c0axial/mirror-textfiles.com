     Here's the test, then. [grin]

     This should be half to one third the size of usual editions. Must be
     those summer doldrums.

     More Echomail war stuff. Some new technical stuff still coming in
     spite of FTSC limbo. Our Europe columnist returns today. Our other
     columnist is moving and we all know what a pain that can be.

     The Future History section is shrinking as events pass by. If you have
     something you want there, send it in.

     Don't forget the many ways you can get your input into FidoNews. All
     the ways are detailed every week in the Masthead at the end of each

     And where is Doc Loggerhead?

     Re: Guest editorial of issue 14-28
     by Damien Wellman
     damienw@juno.com

      I've been keeping a letter to FidoNews on the back burner for quite
     some time, but I've hesitated. The guest editorial of issue 14-28
     prompted me to finally speak my piece.

      To the anonymous author of that editorial, thank you. I've wanted to
     say exactly what you did. I think the idea is fantastic; the Internet
     isn't a giant monolith, after all, it is "merely" a giant network of
     other networks. As Fidonet is the oldest and (IMHO) best of all the
     amateur nets, it's really a crime NOT to hook Fido up to the Internet.

       After all, while Netmail is not that great anymore (thanks to the
     wide availability of Internet email) Echomail and file echoes are,
     again IMHO, two of the best things about Fidonet. Echoes, unlike
     Usenet newsgroups, are better moderated, nearly spam-free, and unlike
     the commercial services, moderators don't have to worry about losing a
     job because they threw someone who was excessively annoying out of the
     echo... who just happens to be a paying customer. (AOL is very bad at
     this.)

       Plus, access to most BBSes is free or extremely low-cost... and
     unlike the Internet, will have more people local to you. After all,
     you can't talk much about a local flood in a newsgroup, but on a local
     BBS you can.  And you'll have Fidonet as well... and under the two-
     line scheme proposed in the 14-28 guest editorial, the user can use
     Internet services as well, all for a fairly low cost. If it costs the
     sysop $25 a month for simple dial-up access, and each user pays even
     $15 a _year_ for this access, you don't need too many users to keep
     the costs down. It'll still cost the sysop some money - that's why
     this is a hobby rather than a business - but it won't be exceedingly
     pricey.

       I think lots of people would flock to Fidonet if they _only knew it
     existed_, and if it was easily accessible via internet (hence the
     transferring of mail packets through FTP rather than phone lines). In
     fact, the idea is very simple; keep the current process, changing ONLY
     the method of transportation. All that needs to be done is write
     software that is geared towards receiving it via FTP or similar rather
     than a phone call. It may not be THAT much of an "only", but it's
     hardly an insurmountable task.

      All I can say is this: all of the expert programmers and hackers out
     there should get cracking and figure out how to do this. Better yet,
     let's see if someone can do better than the currently-available
     kludges.  There's no reason for Fidonet and BBSing to die out - it
     must simply adapt to a new set of conditions. Let's see if we can get
     a _growth_ in total number of nodes for once.

      Oh, and Chris - hope you don't mind my use of Tom Jennings' quote
     that appears in the end of Fidonews... hell, I hope *Tom* doesn't
     mind. :)

     A Users Manifesto by Nic Boie(Shensey)

     I live in a new community.  It is called "CyberSpace".  CyberSpace is
     held together by the members.  The United States of America thought
     they could limit us.  They tried to pass the CDA.  It failed.  I will
     NOT go down without a fight.  We will NOT give our freedoms up because
     parents cannot monitor their children.  If a kid wants porn, their
     gonna get it.  No matter what you do/say.  It has been, is, and always
     will be this way.  We live this community, most all of the users feel
     the same way.  Do your math, what side has more?  Think about this: No
     matter what restrictions you put on us, we will still do it.  And you
     cant catch 100,000,000 people.


     Shensey a member of the United States of America and CyberSpace.

     p.s. When I say CyberSpace I refer to ALL online sources Including but
     not limiting to BBS's, INTERNET, and FIDONET.

     First off, I'm in the middle of a move, and am not anywhere I can set
     my system up right now.  I should return to the nodelist in about a
     week or two.  Until that time, all moderator duties are handled by my
     second, Brent Hamm.  A copy of this is being forwarded to him so that
     he may act on your complaint.

     Second, I submitted no rules file when I re-listed REAL_FREE_SPEECH.
     This was intentional.  It is now an area devoted to actual free
     speech, not the censorship that you and the rest of the "backbone"
     folks now like to employ.

     Third, I'd really like this posted to the snooze Chris, it's the only
     way I think Bruce can be kept honest.

     SIX MONTHS OF FIDO: nodelist day 313 1996, to day 122 1997:
                         a roundup of nodelist statistics

     By Ronnie L. Grant, 1:102/836 ronnie.grant@global.dyn.ml.org

     Ward Dossche, the Zone 2 Coordinator, has been posting nodelist
     statistics in FidoNews every week, showing information from the last
     five nodelists. Inspired by that, and wanting some longer-term data, I
     have compiled this information covering 22 nodelists: from Friday,
     November 8, 1996 -- Day number 313, thru Friday, May 4, 1997 -- Day
     122.

     Table I shows some fun statistics focusing on the nodelist itself,
     including status flags and the actual uncompressed file sizes. Tables
     II and III break down the number of nodes by zone; the percentages at
     the right is that zone's percentage of all nodes worldwide. Table IV
     shows the net change for each zone and worldwide between day 313 and
     122.

     If you find errors in the math, please submit them as a FidoNews
     proofreading (.PRF) article; note that some percentages are rounded
     and will not add up to 100.0%.

     DISCLAIMER: Nothing in this article is meant to construe
     any predictions about the future of Fidonet.

     To answer this question: "FidoNet-IP" is already a reality. In some
     places at least. I fell over these while randomly surfing the net (at
     http://www.falcon.spb.su/fido.vmodem.html to be precise):

     I think that the above shows clearly that there is a need for IP-
     connectivity in Fidonet. The technology is there, what we need are
     political decisions that allow these nodes to be inserted somehow into
     the "real" nodelist. One could imagine for example a Flag, indicating
     that the entry in the phonenumber-field is an ip-address. Or a
     completely new nodelist format.

     But I could also observe two rather negative facts: Firstly, a number
     of nodes are not accepting this new form of connectivity: As one
     German node put it: "Go away with this crap. This is Fido and not
     internet." Intolerance and arrogance is sad.

     Secondly: "FidoNet is defined by a NodeList issued weekly by the
     International Coordinator." (Policy 4.07) But where is he ?
     According to the rumours, our 6 ZCs can't get their act together and
     vote a new one. According to these same rumours, one or two of them
     can't even speak English, and according to these rumours one of them
     behaves like a fascist. I have no idea if this is true. Perhaps some
     ZC can comment on this?


     P.S.: Sorry for my bad writing, but English isn't my mother tongue.

     by David Meikle (2:259/27.4)

     Remember back in January I rote my last Fidonet in Europe, I bet you
     were all upset ;-o Now I'm back with a vengeance :->

     Now down to Biz. In March I got a reply to a request which I put out
     in January to help out Jean Parrot. A Herr Rolf Behringer sent the
     answer so lets all give him a Sehr Gut. SEHR GUT!. So this section
     really does work.

     If you would like to contact Rolf Fido in Germany drop him a line at
     Rolf Behringer@2:2476/812 & I'm sure he will be glad to help.  He runs
     THE HAIRY GRILL BBS its number in Germany is 07631-10559 and from
     anywhere else is 49-7631-10559.

     If you have any news or requests send a message to europe@2:259/27.4 .

     Subject: nodelist flags
     from: Steve Woodmore

     Version:  001
     Date:     17th July 1997
     Author:   Steve Woodmore


                   Internet as a transport mechanism for fidonet
                          A proposal for Nodelist flags
                   by Steve Woodmore, 2:440/410 (2:2/200 ZEC/2)
                            Version 1: 17th July 1997


     1 Introduction

           This document only discusses and deals with nodes that have the
           capability to transfer fidonet packets across the Internet,
           allowing low-cost access to nodes/points/users anywhere in the
           world.  The proposal is for nodelist flags to indicate this
           ability.

           This proposal assumes the reader has some knowledge of
           Internet transport mechanisms.

           Transferring data across the Internet can be done in one of
           three ways:

           1: FTP (File Transfer protocols)

           2: Email attaches MIMES/UUencodes (this also assumes tunneling
              programs)

           3: Virtual Modems

           This document aims to define the way in which nodes are to
           inform other nodes of their Internet capabilities in the
           nodelist.

      Nodelist flags

           Internet-related nodelist flags consist of two prefix indicators
           and a suffix.

           The prefix indicators are IN (for internet transfer capable).
           The suffix indicates the way in the Internet is used.

              IE

                INo(p)oo

             Suffix types
     FIDONEWS 14-29               Page 13                  21 Jul 1997


             V  - A virtual modem exists at this Node

             F  - This Node has an FTP server available for mail transfers

             M  - This Node is able to transfer mail either by UUencoded
                  attaches, MIME encoded attaches, or Via a Tunnel method.
                  Because mail packets can be stored on the Nodes ISP until
                  the Node Dials up, this method does not need 24hr
                  operation.
                  A node must dial-up their ISP to collect/send fidonet
                  mail at least Once daily to qualify for this flag

             P  - Is an optional flag and should only follow a V or an F
                  Suffix This indicates Part-time (not 24hr) operation, and
                  enquiries should be made to this node for hours of
                  operation details.


            If more than one suffix is used, the suffixes will be sorted in
            ascending order.

            These flags DO NOT indicate if the Node operates a "Cost
            recovery" Scheme or not.

            Examples:

            INVP  -  This node has a virtual modem, but not running 24hrs

            INFPMV - This node has FTP (part time), mailer & Virtual modem
                     Capabilities.

            INM   -  This node has Internet mailer/tunneling available

            Rationale:
                      The Internet is here to stay, we in fidonet can no
                      longer hide our heads in the sand and hope it goes
                      away.  The flags indicate that we are using the
                      nodelist as an alternative transport mechanism, and
                      we are in no way becoming a part of the Internet.

                      By using and incorporating this transport method into
                      the Nodelist, we can open fidonet up to a much wider
                      audience.

                      These flags do NOT do away with the Need to be FTS001
                      compliant during ZMH This is still a minimum
                      requirement.

      7) "You question the worthiness of my Code?!
               I should kill you where you stand!"

      6) "Our competitors are without honor!"

      5) "Specs are for the weak and timid!"

      4) "This machine is a piece of GAGH! I need dual
               Pentium processors if I am to do battle with
               this code!"

      3) "Perhaps it IS a good day to Die!  I say

      2) "My program has just dumped Stoval Kor!"

     Don't risk being banned! Use FIDOTEST.

     Almost ALL other echoes FORBID posting TEST messages.  Where do you
     and your users send 'test' posts to ensure they are leaving your
     system?  Which Backboned echo can you use to ensure your posts are
     reaching the far corners of Z1, or to see if upstream/downstream
     systems are wrecking or loosing your message?

     Why not a specific echo devoted to testing echomail links?

     There is one!  If you believe it to be beneficial for the Fidonet
     community to have a _dedicated_ and _authorized_ echo for testing, be
     sure to ask your REC to ensure that

             FIDOTEST -
             the Fidonet TEST echo and malfunction conference

     gets Z1-Backboned.

     Remember: only YOU can make sure your REC knows your position on the
     backboning of FIDOTEST.

     Netmail him today, because without your help, tomorrow's Fidonet may
     never arrive.
