Editorial: Remotely yours


My electronic world is deteriorating. I have to call in at 300 baud to
edit this rag (sic) due to problems with the phone line here at my
(new) boyfriends house here in the Pacific NorthWest.

I have to admit that I'm not doing a particularly good job this week;
I've fallen terribly in love with a wonderful punk boy, and won't be
back at the end of the month like I said. Don't worry, I wont inflict
lovey-dovey garbage on FidoNews readers. People in love are sooo
disgusting to be around (just ask his roommate).

This issue contains more on the lost-mail subject. Amazing what a
strong interest it has generated... I hope budding FidoNet
investigative journalists consider documenting chronic netmail dead
ends.

I received an interesting message on FidoNews policy, that I think is
worth including:

> From: Alan Powell, 1:240/1
> Subj: BIZYNET IN FIDONEWS?

[regarding: CAUCUS echo announcement in last week's Snooze.]

> Greetings Tom,

> I'm just a lowly FidoNet user who,
> amongst other things, enjoys reading
> FidoNews regularly.

> While you may get a number of
> different responses to this FidoNews
> announcement (above), mine is simply
> to question your acceptance of other
> nets announcements through FidoNews?

To tell the truth, I hadn't given it any thought. While FidoNews is a
component of the FidoNet, I think there's other factors. It's not "us
vs. them" situation. The notice-author is a also FidoNet member.
Promoting communications is a good thing in general, and
modem/BBS/FidoNet technology more specifically.

If the percentage of non-FidoNet oriented stuff grew large, I'd have
to reconsider.

FidoNews 9-25                  Page 2                      22 Jun 1992


Besides, I wasn't even aware of BIZYNET, so probably others are not
either. It probably serves some peoples needs better than FidoNet. The
more the merrier, I say; by cooperating we can only gain.

Genuinely, thanks for the message Alan. The parameters of this thing
are not fixed, and there are a lot of unspoken assumptions. Dialog is
always good.

JVArcServ - a server to locate specified archives.

JVArcServ V1.00 is now under beta testing and seems to be running well
with a release version to be out soon.  JVArcServ eliminates your woes
in trying to find a certain file, and eliminates the "does anyone have
such and such for file request" questions in the echos.

JVArcServ is based on the InterNet utility Archie designed at McGill
University in Canada.  This utility allows users to locate programs
available via anonymous FTP from sites around the world.  Since there
are thousands of anonymous FTP sites around the world, each one
holding several gigabytes of software, this utility was a great sigh
of relief.  There are now eight Archie servers in operation today.

FTN networks can sometimes give operators the same problems.  There is
lots of software out there available via file requests.  The question
is just "where?".

The server keeps a specially formatted version of each system's file
list in the network.  Users can then ask questions such as "Where is
this filename," "Find this description," and "Does anything match this
keyword?".

Some other interesting commands are also available such as "List nodes
and zones covered by this server" and other such questions.

JVArcServ is as automated as possible.  It will allow new nodes to
join automatically through netmail, and new file lists will be
automatically requested each month.  The sysop running the server will
only have to set it up once and then forget that it exists.

The idea behind JVArcServ is that one node in each network will run
the server and maintain file lists from every other node in the
network.  The server will only be useful with the cooperation of all
the sysops in the network to register with the server and keep undated
versions of the formatted file lists.

JVArcServ and the file compiler also implements a routing system in
the event that a node is long distance from the server.  When the node
registers, it can ask that its file list be requested from a different
node.  In this case, the node creating the file lists would send its
file lists to this second node where it is to be requested from.

An echo for beta testers and technical support for JVArcServ has been
created and it is available from 1:250/318.

JVArcFC, the program which creates the specially formatted file lists,
is now available as a general release.  It can be file requested from
1:250/318 as JVARCFC.

If you are interested in JVArcServ, if you have any questions, or if
you want to set it up for your network, just send me netmail and I'll
be happy to help you out.  The server is now running at 1:250/318.  To
try it out, send netmail to "JVArcServ", and in the body of the text
include the line "HELP".

A reply to Glenn Caleval's article in Fnews 9-24

None is more timely than Mr. Caleval's article.  Recently my NEC decided
to go on a holiday, and forgot to give us all keys to his house
(understandably). About a week ago all mail stopped.  The NEC's system
is dead, and he's somewhere, out there.  NO MAIL.  Nada.  Nihil.  None.

Mr. Caleval's article therefore struck a cord.  I know why my mail isn't
being delivered, but Mr. Jennings, as he said in his editorial, doesn't.
I therefore disagree with the article on several points.  I hate to
quote Policy (Lord knows Policy has its limits), however the following
sections of Policy4 are applicable in this situation:

 === cut here ===

2.1.7  Not Routing Mail

If you do not forward a message when you previously agreed to perform
such routing, the message must be returned to the sysop of the node at
which it entered FidoNet with an explanation of why it was not
forwarded.

9.9    Echomail

Echomail is an important and powerful force in FidoNet.  For the
purposes of Policy Disputes, echomail is simply a different flavour of
netmail, and is therefore covered by Policy.

 === cut here ===

Echomail, to me then, entails the same responsibilities as netmail. They
are the same thing.  When netmail enters a routing point it is separated
from echomail.  It IS NOT simply part of the package.  It goes into a
different area (for less than a minute mind you) before being packaged
up again for delivery, but it is the same thing. Par example, if "Fred"
on InterNet sends me a message, it enters the world at 1:114/15, gets
packaged up with the days echomail, and gets transferred to 13/13.  It
is then unpacked, and packed up again for transfer to 12/12.  From 12/12
it is picked up by my NEC who unpacks it, and packs it up again for
FidoNews 9-25                  Page 5                      22 Jun 1992


transfer to my hub, who does the same thing, and voila, it gets picked
up by my system and I read it and reply, which effectively begins the
process again.  While they are separate things to my Routing Software
(in this instance Squish) they are the same 'kind' of thing and deserve
the same kind of respect.

While it is assumed that netmail is 'free' when packaged up with
echomail, it is actually being covered by the cost of the echomail.  I
believe it is estimated that a months netmail going through 13/13 costs
around a dime. It is not an add-on, it is and was the original purpose
of FidoNet.  (To send messages to people in other areas of the world.)
It costs in the same fashion as echomail costs.

While the time for delivery of a piece of netmail may vary it is to be
assumed that it WILL be delivered.  If it is not, as Mr. Jennings said,
something is rotten in Denmark. (Or STEREO (()) WHERE AVAILABLE -- take
your pick.) If it is not, it is the responsibility of those who are in
the routing structure to let the sysop who sent the message (so long as
they are still in the nodelist) know WHY it was not sent.

It is hoped that the problems, with time, will disappear.  Routing
problems, I've found, have a tendency to work themselves out.  But if we
are all doing our jobs, they shouldn't appear in the first place.

The Introduction of two nets looking for expansion.

Of course there is FIDO net, SIGNet, EchoNet and EggNet.
And many more, to numerous to name here.

All well respected nets who's size is not quite as big
as FIDO but still as good.

I live in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.  I represent two nets which
you have probabbly never heard of.  The Homeboy Net, and the
Digital Net.  They are both looking for expansion outside of
Ottawa.  We are looking for any system located any where in
Canada, U.S. or the world.  And one note of importance:
All mail/files will be at our expense.  You will not have to
make any long distance calls.  We feel you are doing us a
favor by joining, not the other way around.  This is why
we have accepted that policy.

Let me explain each net.  The Homeboy Net (THBNet) is deicated
to music, and the weird and unusual things that other nets
didn't quite seem to offer.  We have discussions and message
traffic is quite heavy for our current size.  There are polictal
echo's,talk about dating echo's and chatting echo's.  Suggestions
for new echo's are always welcome.

FidoNews 9-25                  Page 6                      22 Jun 1992


The Digital Net (DIGINet) was formed to help people with
problems.  Any kind of problems, not nesscerily computer realted
however this is our main focus right now.  There are echo's for
help with general computing, programming, bbs software, mailers
and echo mail tossers.  We also have a shrink echo for those
who are feeling down.  Suggestions for new echo's are always
welcome.

If you are wishing to join either net, please contact 1:163/505
,50:5613/104 or 102:613/3. If you apply, your connection will
be setup ASAP and if no one else is active in your area you will
more than likely become the new network host for your region.
And remember, all of this mail will be at our expense.  You can't
do better than that.

If you need more information, please do not hesitate to contact
those addresses above or file request THBN for the Homeboy Net
information or DIGI for the Digital Net information from
1:163/505.

Thank You FIDO for coming up with the technology which allows
us all to be free.  Until Later,

Joshua Lewis (1:163/505, 50:5613/104, 102:613/3)
