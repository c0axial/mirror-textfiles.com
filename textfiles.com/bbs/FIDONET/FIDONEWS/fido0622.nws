                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================

     Hello again.   Glad  to see you're still here.  I appreciate your
     loyalty.

     This week, I'm starting  a  series of articles entitled "The Lost
     FidoNet Archives".  Using materials  sent me by Ken Kaplan, Harry
     Lee, and a few other FidoNet  "old-timers",  we have been able to
     put together some stuff that everyone should  read at least once.
     Of course, many of you might have seen  it before, but, you know,
     just reading some of these things again reminds me  of  something
     I've been missing lately.

     That something is:  what is GOOD about FidoNet.   We've  all been
     hearing from  various  people  about  what's  BAD  about FidoNet.
     Well, if it's  so  damned bad, why are we all still here, many of
     us at great personal  expense?    Think about it.  Maybe a few of
     you could write something, expressing  YOUR opinion on the issue.
     I'll sure as hell print it!

     Anyway, I hope you enjoy the  materials  I have found.  If anyone
     out there has anything else they think  is worth printing in this
     series, feel free to send it along.

     Cheers,
     Vince

            "THE FALCON'S ROCK STARTS 'DCJOBS' ECHO CONFERENCE"

        George Falcon, SysOp  of "The Falcon's Rock" (Opus 1:109/501)
     is starting an echo conference called "DCJOBS".

        The mission of the echo conference  will  be  to expedite the
     job search process for individuals, and to  serve  as a resource
     for  personnel managers and human resource departments.   It  is
     the intent of the echo conference that the emphasis  in the echo
     conference  will  be  on  the participation of principals in the
     hiring  process.   While those who rework resumes and guide job-
     seekers in  improving their image serve a valuable function, I'd
     like  to  see    this    conference   benefit  from  the  active
     participation of jobseekers and those in a position to hire them
     directly.

        Access to the echo conference  is not restricted to any fixed
     geographical area, or to any specific  class of users or SysOps.
     There is no restriction on the type  of  jobs  being  sought  or
     offered...    pyramid  schemes  and "unlimited income potential"
     jobs are a waste of everyone's time.

        Those SysOps interested in participating in the new echo will
     have to poll 109/501 for it.

                            The Entreprenuer Echo


     The Entreprenuer echo, ENTREPRENUER, is a backbone echo that
     has been created in response to a need of new business people
     to be informed on start-up business assistance provided by a
     myriad of sources. With the business failure rate somewhere
     between 80 to 90 percent of new business ventures ENTREPRENUER
     will address the need to put people together with common
     questions and experience to help guide a new business individual
     to a well informed decision.

     Any topics dealing with new & newer business efforts can be dealt
     with. Business plans, presentations, research resources and
     support in promotional ideas and advertising.

     If you are starting or thinking of starting a business... you
     will find ENTREPRENUER the place to get information from people
     that have "been there".

     If you would like to carry this echo please contact your NEC, REC
     or BIZNET BBS System, 1:307/1.

     EuroconIII - A Preliminary Report

     Personal impressions by Henk Wevers, former ZC2
     (official reports will follow)

     This past weekend, Zone Two had its third FidoNet Conference,
     called EuroconIII in Eindhoven, The Netherlands.  During the
     conference, a lot of subjects were discussed, problems were
     solved and directions for the next year were set.  Below are a
     few of the more important subjects, seen from my personal point
     of view.  There will be official reports of the meeting in a
     week. I'm sure they will be published in FidoNews.


     1. Resignation of the ZC2, Henk Wevers

     One year ago at EuroconII, I announced that I would resign at
     the next conference.  Candidates were sought and were found, but
     at EuroconIII we had only one serious candidate left, Ron Dwight
     from Finland.  Ron was strongly supported by a popular ballot
     taken of the attendees of the 1989 EuroconIII.

     2. Directions for European FidoNet Organisation set

     It has been decided that there will be a European FidoNet
     organisation.  The goals of this organisation are limited and
     will be (among a few others I don't remember now)
        - Funding of the ZC2 so far as is possible
        - Acting as an external affairs comittee for FidoNet Europe,
          by helping with public relations and contacts with other
          organisations and goverments, eg. PTTs, EC, etc.
        - Holding the copyright for the Z2 portion of the FidoNet
          nodelist
        - It has been stated clearly that the organisation is for
          supporting what is now called FidoNet in Zone 2.

     It is very clear that the above organisation will not interfere
     with the daily operation of FidoNet.  How and when a system is
     allowed into the net, working routine, complaints etc. will
     still be set by a policy.  Currently Europe is running under
     Policy-4E (and has been for over a year).

     3. Policy changes agreed

     It has been agreed that the way the *C's are choosen will be by
     democratic means (bottom up up to the ZC level).

     The current Policy-4 proposal has been voted down unanimously.
     Attendees will organize the nay voting of their region.  A new
     proposal with above changes will see light and done by the new
     ZC, who estimates a month, maybe two.

     4. Mandatory fee for a net being in the nodelist

     In order to fund the European FidoNet organisation to make sure
     that the operation of the ZC and the costs of public relations
     FidoNews 6-22                Page 5                   29 May 1989


     and contacts with organisations and goverments can be financed
     it was agreed that there will be a mandatory fee for a net to be
     in the nodelist.  The fee was set at 4 ECU multiplied by the
     number of individual nodes in the net.  How a net raises their
     contribution is their affair.  Regions collect the money from
     independend nodes.  There will be a yearly check on this and a
     net not fulfilling this requirement will be put on hold in the
     nodelist by the ZC2.

     5. Steering comittee formed

     A steering committee has been formed to found the European
     FidoNet organisation.  The BOD of such an organisation will be
     between 3 and 5 members.  The BOD is appointed by a voting
     comittee that has a member of each region (country).  How a
     region (country) chooses their member of the voting committee is
     their business, but it should be done in a democratic way (what
     normally is regarded as democratic in their region, in any case,
     bottom up).

     6. International scope expressed clearly

     From above it is clear that the European sysops are seeking a
     different way to handle FidoNet than the sysops in zone 1 (we
     are not sure about zone 3 and 4).  The attendees expressed their
     intent to be part of the international FidoNet community, and
     hope that these differences will not lead to splits or other
     problems.  They think that all parties can live with the
     decisions made so far and that the attempt to organise the net
     in the described way should get a fair chance.

     7. Pleasant Conference

     The conference has been a pleasant way to meet other sysops of
     Europe and the USA.  You can imagine that it is difficult to
     come to an agreement as described in the above paragraphs.  But
     all attendees have been very helpfull and were always seeking
     ways to overcome differences in opinion.  From above you can see
     that they succeeded.  And yes, besides heavy stuff like the
     above, long discussions and very warm meetings, we also had
     technical discussions, a lot of beer, loooong dinners (phew!),
     floppy disk throwing contests, hard disk throwing contests,
     visits to the Evoluon and a lot more fun.  Be sure to be there
     next year!

                         THE LOST FIDONET ARCHIVES
                                VOLUME ONE

                  Compiled by various members of FidoNet
                         Edited by Vince Perriello


     This is the first article in a series which reprints documents of
     historical significance  to  FidoNet.    This week we feature Tom
     Jennings' original description of FidoNet, which was  first  made
     available  to  Fido  Sysops  in  the  form  of    a  file  called
     FIDONET.DOC, in April 1984 (the date on the file  I  have  is May
     26, 1984).

     Please note that most  if  not all of the FidoNet addresses, data
     line phone numbers, and company  names and/or addresses mentioned
     in this or any of the  other  articles  in this series are not to
     be considered reliable for current use in  locating  something or
     someone  mentioned here.  Refer to the current  nodelist  if  you
     want to try to find any of the above.

     The original text of the file (with minor reformatting) follows:

     Tom Jennings
     30 Apr 84
     Fido #1: (415)-864-1418

     Some preliminary  ideas  for the FidoNet.  (If you haven't heard,
     FidoNet is an  intersystem  message forwarding system mostly for
     Fidos, but could be used for others as well.)

     Please, don't worry about  all the seeming complexity here.  Most
     will go away.  I  have just typed everything I could think of all
     at once, and not all is  applicable.  (Besides, you're (probably)
     not gonna code it.)

     There are some points that need ideas:    mainly,  how to pay for
     it, how it will appear to callers trying  to  send  mail, and any
     mysterious operational type problems you see.  Like most of Fido,
     I imagine this too will be built with 90% suggestions.

     If you have any ideas on this proposed system, please  leave me a
     note on Fido #1 at the above number.  Thanks.

                             O P E R A T I O N


     From a callers point of view, the system will have one additional
     feature  when  entering a message.  One way or another the caller
     tells Fido which system the message is to be sent to.  This could
     consist of a  prompt (System A, B, ...) or some such thing.  (Any
     ideas?)

     In any case, mail  will  only  work  from  a  MAIL  subdirectory.
     Messages left here will be  like all other messages;  readable or
     not, depending on the privacy, etc.    Replies  can be left, etc,
     FidoNews 6-22                Page 7                   29 May 1989


     which get mailed in the same way.

     It  may be desirable to search this  area  for  each  user  after
     signon,  the  same  way  message  searching works now.    If  old
     messages don't pile up like in other areas, this  should  be nice
     and fast.

     There   will  not  be  any  automatic  confirmation  of  received
     messages.   It  will  be  up  to  the user to do so, by mailing a
     message stating that  is was received.  Maybe it will be possible
     to confirm, by reading the RECV'D flag from the message, but that
     won't go into the first one.

     In the MAIL area, the  usual  message  search  ("Messages to you"
     etc) should be adequate, if mail traffic is less than or the same
     as the current message traffic.

                        I M P L E M E N T A T I O N

     The only change to Fido will be a new command line parameter:

             <number>/Y
             <number>/W

     /Y Is the hour of the day  to  start  doing  mail  as  opposed to
     normal BBS stuff.  /W is the window width, in minutes, to do mail
     in.  For example, 0200/Y 90/W says do mail from 2:00AM, for up to
     90 minutes, i.e.  until 3:30AM.  During this time,  Fido will not
     accept  any normal callers.  Also, outside these times, Fido will
     not accept  mail.   If no switch is present, or the window is set
     too small (TBD)  then  it  will not send or receive mail, like it
     does now.

     Neither will it bump  someone  off  if  they  happen to call just
     before the appointed time.   However,  as soon as they logoff, it
     will start handling mail if it's supposed to.

     The mailer (the program that actually sends and receives mail) is
     a seperate program.  It is run  from  the batch file (RUNBBS.BAT)
     right after Fido.EXE.  This works like Control-C  and  errors do;
     via ERRORLEVEL.  For instance, the batch file might look like:

                     FIDO  ... 0200/Y 90/W
                     IF ERRORLEVEL 4 GOTO MAIL
                     IF ERRORLEVEL 1 GOTO END
                     RUNBBS
             MAIL:
                     MAILER 0200/Y 90/W
                     RUNBBS
             END:

     Like current Fidos, ERRORLEVEL is 0 if normal termination (caller
     hung up, etc) 1 if Control-C or stack overflow, 2  if  disk  file
     error  (disk  full, missing files, etc) or 4, the new level  for:
     "Time to do Mail".

     FidoNews 6-22                Page 8                   29 May 1989


     If it's time to do mail, Fido exits with ERRORLEVEL 4.   If  4 or
     higher, it runs  MAILER,  which then runs RUNBBS.BAT which starts
     it all over again.    Otherwise, if 1 (or higher) it is an error,
     it goes to the end and stops.

     When run, the mailer sits  and  waits  for  phone  calls,  or  if
     instructed to do so, (command line  switches  or  a command file,
     whatever) makes calls.  If a human  type  caller calls, they will
     get a message to the effect "Waiting for  mail,  please call back
     after <xxx>", where <xxx> is the end of the  window  to  wait for
     mail,  and  hang up on them.  (The /W and  /Y  switches  will  be
     duplicated in the mailer, for reasons I'll not bother with now.)

                                  C O S T

     First,  it  is  very  important that we figure out what it  would
     cost.    This  is the second most important part.  The cheaper it
     is, the  more  likely  FidoNet can be made operable.  However, no
     matter how cheap  it  is,  if  an  ingenous  way of paying for it
     doesn't exist, then it all falls flat.

     Right now, late night long distance (coast to coast) toll charges
     are about $13.00 per hour.    ATT  is  proposing, as part of some
     other boring issue, lowering this to  $10.00  per  hour.  This is
     quite cheap;  a lot of messages can be sent in an hour.

     I hereby declare the mail size unit to be the Cubit:

     1 Cubit == 80 characters * (1200 / baud rate)

     A cubit of mail sent at 300 baud will cost 4 times as much as one
     sent at 1200.  When 4800 baud modems  become available, the price
     per cubit will drop.

     Unlike commercial mail systems that are out for profit, FidoNet's
     mail unit, the Cubit, is small enough to account for  very  small
     messages,  but  large enough not to be too small to account  for.
     There are 12.8 cubits in a K byte.

     An error  checking  transfer protocol is needed;  XMODEM will not
     be used, as  transfer  times  routinely  double  with  long phone
     lines.  (Dont want to pay for that.) More on that later.

     As an example, say  we  want  to  send  a  small  (five lines, 64
     characters per line) message from  Los Angeles to New York.  Each
     message has a header (to, from, date, etc) that consumes about 80
     characters.  Assume also that the transfer rate is 1200 baud, and
     also that the transmission method has a 10% overhead.

     Yes ...  its cheap.  Remember, this  is  pure  cost,  no hardware
     maintenaince  overhead,  no  payroll,  no  profit, etc.  Delivery
     time, nor  even  delivery,  is  garenteed.    The  above does NOT
     include any connect/disconnect or disk access overhead.  However,
     it also does not  count  any savings from text compression, which
     could save 10% to 40% maximum.  Probably more like 20% maximum in
     the real world.

                 P A Y I N G    F O R    A L L    T H I S

     This is the most serious problem.    The  technical part is easy!
     Also, BBS's in general are run more  like  little  fiefdoms  than
     businesses, in the sense the are usually operated  privately, and
     almost  never  pay  for  themselves, never mind make money!    If
     FidoNet  takes  inordinate  amounts of effort on the part of  the
     sysop, it'll probably fold up due to that also.

     There  are a couple of ways this can be paid for,  but  none  are
     really any  good  for typical free systems.  (Note that receiving
     (accepting) mail costs nothing.  FidoNet might be able to operate
     well  with  only  a  few  well  placed  "benefactors",  and  work
     acceptably  well  with only local  "paying"  nodes,  if  mail  is
     limited to say, an area code.)

     IF YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS AT  ALL  ON  THIS  SUBJECT  PLEASE  LET  ME
     KNOW!!!!!!  THIS WILL MAKE OR BREAK THE FIDONET IDEA!!!!

     In  any  case, some sort of accounting  will  have  to  be  done.
     Except for very rare cases, mail will have  to  be paid for.  The
     mailer will be able to account for each messages  cost, length of
     transmission, etc.  There must be a method for limiting mail sent
     by  a  specific  user,  and a "sysop" type feature for relatively
     unlimited,  or  at  least    differently   limited,  mail.    The
     information associated with a peice  of  mail  will  have  to  be
     worked  out  in detail later, and  while  not  too  complex  (any
     complexity can be put upon the mailer)  it  must  be adequate for
     future expansion.

     Presumably,  not  everyone  will  be  allowed  to  forward   mail
     indescriminately.    That  would be awful nice, but unfortunately
     not practical.    There  may  be exceptions:  for instance, for a
     club-run system, you  might  want  to  let  any user send a fixed
     amount of mail over  a fixed period of time, say, a month.  If it
     was a dues paying club,  a  number could be worked out that would
     accomodate this.  Anything beyond that  amount  would  have to be
     accounted for by some other method.


     IDEA #1
     FidoNews 6-22                Page 10                  29 May 1989


     Club-run systems. Basically, covered above.

     IDEA #2

     Private, pay-ahead system.  While this is very workable, it means
     even more work for the sysop, and probably  some legal liability,
     like running a business, unless the proper rigamarole wording  is
     used, i.e.  "donations" not "charges".

     No one will be able to send mail unless they  mail some amount of
     money  to  the  sysop.    The  amount donated is kept in  a  list
     maintained  by  the mailer, who subtracts the cost of the message
     from the  balance.    Usual  warnings  if  not  enough,  etc, and
     probably a warning when it reaches some threshold.

                          T H E    N E T W O R K


     Might as well  be  trendy  and use some network terminology here.
     Some of it's even handy.

     The topography of FidoNet  is  in  keeping  with  bulletin  board
     philosophy;    totally  random  and  as  little  organization  as
     possible.  Also, there is no  control  over  the  location of the
     various message nodes (mail send/receive systems).

     My first thought was to pass mail  over  as  short  a distance as
     possible;  however, this is a waste of  time,  as late night long
     distance calls are charged on a per hour basis,  and  in any case
     the  more  transfers  the  higher  likelyhood of messages getting
     lost.

     Message delivery time, if all is well, should be overnight.  If a
     system goes down, delays will be in increments of 24 hours.

     There should also  probably  be  a "broadcast" type message, that
     stops at each node.    Also, there really isn't anything stopping
     binary files from being mailed;    they  are  not  included  here
     mainly because costs will skyrocket, but  it  would be a nice way
     to do Fido updates, etc.


     So, my current idea (any other ideas at all welcome!) is:

     Each sender has a list of systems it can forward to.  This can be
     used  to  limit  forwarding  to non-toll call areas  if  desired.
     Also, this same list can be used to send  mail  destined  for one
     system, to be sent to a different system, for further forwarding.
     This  allows cheapskates to let someone else make the toll calls.
     (If  they in turn let it go) Also, it lets a well  funded  system
     forward mail for other systems.

     If there are  messages destined for five different systems, there
     will be five calls  made (unless the abovementioned forwarding is
     done).  This "nodeless" system  is then relatively insensitive to
     down machines, etc, such that only  mail for the down system will

     not be sent.

     If  the  net gets tied up (everyone  calling  everone  else,  for
     instance,  though  I  think  thats  unlikely!) then some  message
     forwarding  can be done to lessen the traffic load  between  busy
     systems.

                 International FidoNet Convention 1989 is ALIVE!!

     By:  Les Kooyman
          Planning Committee Co-Chairperson
          1:204/501

     This article was prepared from an earlier article written by Todd
     Looney, which was not published. Thanks from all of us, Todd.

     The  Annual   FidoNet Convention  will  be held in  beautiful San
     Jose,  California  this   year, from August  24 though  the 27th,
     1989.   You will  be delighted  with the  location as San Jose is
     located   at the   southern  tip  of the  San Francisco  Bay   in
     Northern    California.   San  Jose has  spent nearly a decade of
     reconstruction and   new building.   San  Jose is  new, sparkling
     and  alive!   The area that was once the sleepy village of Pueblo
     de San   Jose  in the  days of  the Spanish Missions along the El
     Camino Real, has become a prominent financial and cultural center
     renowned throughout the world.

     Downtown has  become cosmopolitan, but  on an intimate scale. The
     Holiday  Inn Park Plaza Hotel, which is situated in the center of
     the  financial and  cultural  area  of  downtown,   will be  this
     years convention  site.   It is directly adjacent to the San Jose
     Museum of  Art, the  new San  Jose Convention Center, and the San
     Jose Center  for Performing  Arts.    San  Jose's  shops,  ethnic
     restaurants and  remnants of  it's colorful  past  are  woven  in
     amongst the  gleaming new high-rises.  Parks and quiet cafes give
     tranquil counterpart  to the  urban bustle.   The broad sidewalks
     are lined  with trees  and flowers.   Parking is easy to find and
     public transportation  virtually eliminates  the need  to rent  a
     car; available  to all  corners of  the Silicon Valley from right
     outside the Holiday Inn where you will be staying.

     There  is  so  much  diversity within   a   few  blocks   walking
     distance:  new   centers  of   industry  and   finance,  museums,
     restaurants offering  fare from over a dozen countries, boutiques
     that sell world-class goods, and Chinese, Hispanic, Japanese, and
     Vietnamese neighborhoods.

     Downtown  is   busy  virtually  around  the   clock.   After  the
     shoppers and  office workers  leave for  the day,  the  theaters,
     cinema's, nightclubs,  and supper  clubs come  alive.    Broadway
     shows, opera, symphony, jazz, ballroom, and disco dancing, stand-
     up  comedian  nightclubs  and  Spanish  language  cinema's  offer
     entertainment for  every taste.   Streets  and parks are brightly
     lit, and  lots of  shops, restaurants, and coffee houses are open
     late into the night.

     Most of all, San Jose is a place for people. San Jose  is located
     one hours  drive away from San Francisco on the   Bay  with  it's
     Golden Gate and rolling hills.   Carmel and Monterey are  just an
     hour  and   a  half  away along  the   rolling Pacific  coastline
     across   the  redwood  and  pine   forests  of  the   Santa  Cruz
     mountains.   Santa Cruz  itself is  a  scenic thirty minute drive
     from your hotel room.

     When you   register  in  advance you   will   receive   a  packet
     containing  all   kinds  of   information  about   the California
     San   Francisco   Bay  area  you  will  find  useful  in planning
     your  vacation around  FidoCon.  You will receive details ranging
     from   nearby   restaurants   and    shops,   to   discounts   on
     surrounding amusements  including the  world famous Great America
     Theme Park  located 15  minutes from  Downtown San  Jose in Santa
     Clara, California.

     This years   convention will   feature many events designed to be
     entertaining  as well  as  informative.    Registration  night is
     Thursday, August  24, 1989,  and there  will be a  reception that
     evening where  you can meet with all those people you have   come
     to    know  through     the  EchoMail  conferences,  as  well  as
     re-establish old  ties with  friends you  met at previous FidoCon
     conventions.

     Friday  and   Saturday offer  two  full   days  of  seminars  and
     workshops.     There  will be four main sessions  per day; two in
     the morning, followed by a break, and then two  in the afternoon.
     There's also room  to hold informal sessions for special interest
     groups, for example, Macintosh BBS sysops. Contact Les Kooyman at
     1:204/501 to add or suggest additions to the  program. Watch  for
     updates about program scheduling and content here in FidoNews.

     Representatives from  companies such as US Robotics (just to name
     one) will  be available  to answer your questions and demonstrate
     their latest line of well known products.

     Friday night's  Banquet promises to be a feast, and you will hear
     from a  well known  keynote speaker  whose identity we  will  not
     reveal until later, just to keep you guessing.

     IFNA  will   hold a  General  Assembly   meeting  as  well as its
     usual meeting of the Board of Directors.

     We  plan to have an intra-hotel Point Net set up for those of you
     who want to  bring your  laptops and  modems.   If   you  want to
     be included in the hotel nodelist, make  sure to indicate this on
     the  registration  form    before you   send it  in.   We'll give
     you more  information on this as we draw closer to the convention
     date.

     We have a block of 150 rooms set  aside just for those of you who
     will  be attending  this years convention.  The room rates at the
     Holiday  Inn Park Plaza, located  at 282 Almaden  Boulevard,  San
     Jose, California  95113,  just  10  minutes  from  the  San  Jose
     International Airport,  are specially  discounted to  $60.00  for
     conventioneers, just  use any  one of  the following  magic words
     when you  call the  Holiday Inn  at 1-408-998-0400  to make  your
     reservations:   FIDOCON, IFNA, FIDONET.  Be sure to tell them you
     want the  special rate or they'll charge you anywhere from $80.00
     to $120.00  for your room.  The $60.00 discount rate is firm, and
     you can  make arrangements for a rollaway bed if you want to bunk
     up three to a room and split the costs.

     Public   transportation is adequate  to get   you where  you want
     to go without having to worry  about  getting killed  by us crazy
     California   drivers  (the   minimum  speed   limit   for  native
     Californians is Warp 7).

     And ramblings it will be.  There's several subjects that need  to
     be touched on and all are  somewhat related.  And all  pertain to
     FidoNet directly.  Looking at  all that has been taking  place is
     like trying to install a new BBS package and a new  mailer all at
     the same time.   There's lots  of information on  each individual
     part but  darned little  to tell  you how  it's all  meant to  go
     together.

     As a quick introduction, "Pete White  <SysOp>" has been active in
     FidoNet for maybe three years.  In that three  years I've been in
     and out of  IFNA, I've been  the Net Coordinator  of Net322, I've
     been (and  still am)  the Regional  Coordinator of  Region 16 and
     I've had enough time to learn  quite a bit about FidoNet and  the
     forces that drive it and make it work.  I'm also the moderator of
     the Gaming echo conference  and active in TBBS-Net,  the Software
     Distribution  Network  (SDN),  the  Software  Distribution System
     (SDS) and the TBBS Distribution  Network (TDN).  In other  words,
     I'm obviously certifiable!   But no  where near as  badly as some
     others out there.

     I see some  interesting things in  the echo conferences  and when
     reading FidoNews.  I see attacks on those who are spending  their
     time and money trying to  feed the `echo-holics'.  I  see attacks
     on the *C structure for much of what they do, or don't do.  I see
     a lot  of commentary  by folks  who are  obviously so  biased and
     upset they  ought to  be collecting  stamps or  seeking an  inner
     light.   But I  also see  a system  that works.   Needs  a bit of
     improvement, no doubt, but it works.

     What I don't see are answers to some of the basic questions  I've
     asked since day one, that first day I unknowingly got a mailer to
     work!  When I see all  the messages about "power plays" and  "the
     coordinators have  all the  power" I  really get  confused.  Will
     someone out there tell me POWER  over what?  Is there a  monetary
     benefit here that I'm missing that makes POWER profitable?  If  I
     have the POWER can I make my echo feeds send me the echos instead
     of me paying to go after them?  I somewhat doubt that!  Actually,
     it looks very  much like those  who are blamed  for wanting POWER
     are those who are doing all the work.

     How about  those who  are screaming  for democracy?   Have any of
     them  every  watched  "democracy  at  work"  within FidoNet?  You
     really ought to  try it.   Watching democracy at  work when there
     was an ECHOPOL conference was enough to sell me on anything  but.
     All I saw there was a few who were interested in only  themselves
     and spent most  of their time  practicing in the  age old FidoNet
     tradition of  "the beating  of dead  horses" while  a few  others
     tried to get some intelligence  from the proceedings.  Those  who
     scream loudly for "democracy"  have absolutely NO idea  what they
     are asking for.

     And those who feel the *C team could do better?  Sure, there's no
     FidoNews 6-22                Page 19                  29 May 1989


     doubt it can do better, and if it weren't for people it would  be
     perfect.   You do  know the  members of  the *C  team are people,
     don't you?   And  many of  them are  doing a  darned good job.  I
     don't know every member of the  *C team but if those running  the
     nets all over the world are  anywhere near as good as those  here
     in New England we have little to worry about!  The ones who  make
     me worry are those who want "democracy".  Some of those very same
     people want  to be  able to  run their  own nets  with their  own
     policy!  Imagine it, hundreds of  nets all over the place -  each
     with it's very own  policy.  Why, with  any work at all  we could
     probably  confuse  everyone  as  well  as  the federal, state and
     municipal laws have!  The strange thing is we have many nets  out
     there  doing  just  that,  and  everyone  is  happy!   They never
     demanded the "right" to do it, they all agreed within  themselves
     it was  the right  way to  go and  they went  with it.   Makes me
     wonder about those who are  screaming for the same "rights"  that
     others  have  had  for  years.    Sure  must  be  something wrong
     somewhere.  Whatever it is, there's a LOT of people out there who
     are doing  a LOT  of work  - and  the pay  is pretty slim.  Sure,
     there's a few who are difficult  to get along with and a  few who
     shouldn't be involved  as they do  more damage than  good.  Guess
     that's because they are people.  But if you have a problem with a
     "people", try to use the system to rectify the problem before you
     decide that the system is wrong.

     We  have  a  new  POLICY  out  for  vote  right now.  Every NC is
     supposed to be discussing  it with the all  the nodes in the  net
     before voting and the vote  is supposed to reflect the  wishes of
     the majority.  There's a  couple of points in this  document that
     set my hair on end, every time I think of them, but once we  have
     a document in place that CAN  be changed we can start working  at
     making changes.  That's a LOT more leeway than Congress gives all
     you `voters'!  And if your NC is NOT discussing it with you  then
     send a message to your RC and/or the IC and make it KNOWN.  Don't
     sit in an echo and  cry, hoping someone will see  and understand.
     It doesn't work that way.

     And, of course, we have  all the commentary on FidoNews.   Again,
     those who make the most noise don't seem to know they are dealing
     with people.  They yell "RIGHTS", when they have NO consideration
     for any  ones "rights"  but their  own.   Have you  read anywhere
     about how  the *C  team has  been handling  FidoNews at their own
     expense for years?  Are you aware that the role of the *C team is
     to make FidoNews available,  and NOT  to deliver  it?  I'm one of
     those who  has decided  NOT to  deliver  FidoNews any longer.  As
     every NC in New England is a long distance call  for me it was my
     decision, based on the  fact the readership is  so low it was  no
     longer worth  the expense  of sending  it out  on my nickel every
     week.  Want to guess how many complaints were received?  I  think
     maybe one,  but the  way it  was worded  it's possible  it wasn't
     really a complaint.   Regardless, I received exactly  ONE message
     about  it.    What  don't  I  like  about  FidoNews?  The list is
     lengthy.  Probably the biggest concern I have is when  "freedoms"
     are being considered there is little thought to the fact the IFNA
     is  an  international  organization  and  FidoNews is supposed to
     represent the IFNA.  Some of the things we discuss in our  "free"
     FidoNews 6-22                Page 20                  29 May 1989


     society could  get a  SysOp in  another country  dragged from the
     keyboard and locked  up, and that's  in a country  where they are
     tolerant!  But my biggest  disappointment is that a vehicle  that
     could  be  used  to  communicate  with  ALL  of FidoNet reaches a
     smaller percentage than you might know.  Even when it's delivered
     it isn't read.   Ask around, see how  many YOU can find  who read
     it.  Most  have given it  up.  If  they want to  read about cars,
     they buy Road & Track.   Someone recently mentioned the  articles
     here about pets, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with those
     articles.  Lot's  of good info  there.  But  there's hundreds out
     there that don't want to read about pets.  And where do they  ask
     for input on the publication?  In the very same publication  that
     many have stopped reading!  It appears the question worth  asking
     is  whether  FidoNews  is  truly  serving  the needs of the 5000+
     members of FidoNet or should it be for IFNA members only?

     Enough, already!   All I can  recommend is that  when reading ANY
     commentary, including this, it's  best to remember that  the ones
     doing all the complaining are  representative of less than 5%  of
     the members of FidoNet.  The *C structure is responsible to  100%
     of the net.   Look at  what FidoNet is.   Simply amazing  that it
     works at all!  And what makes it work?  The very same people  who
     are doing everything wrong.  And you wonder why I'm confused?

     These ramblings are my  own and I am  in no way speaking  for the
     rest  of  the  *C  team.    They're quite capable of speaking for
     themselves.    If  anyone  would  care  to discuss anything said,
     please send net mail to me at 16/0, be happy to learn all I can.

     From:   Randy Bush of 105/6
     To:     David Dodell 1/0
     Subj:   Formal Objection to Proposed Method of Policy-4
             Ratification

     David,

     I hereby file a formal objection to and complaint about the
     method by which you, the IC/ZC and the RCs, are attempting to
     put a new FidoNet policy, Policy-4, in place.

     You have unilaterally declared that it will be ratified by a
     procedure described for the first time within the document
     itself, and not by the procedure(s) in place now, before the
     document is accepted.

     Policies 1 through 3 were adopted by a consensus of the net as a
     whole, and P3 was subsequently (though irrevelantly, IMHO)
     ratified by IFNA.  At the time Policy-3 was adopted, it was
     assumed that time would require new policy, and the the new
     policy would be adopted by means similar to that of Policies
     1-3.

     If and only if Policy-4 is accepted, then the procedure outlined
     in Policy-4 is appropriate for adopting a Policy-5 or whatever.
     But, there is absolutely no grounds under current FidoNet policy
     and procedures for Policy-4 to be adopted by just the *Cs.

     I formally object, and deny your right to use such procedures,
     and deny the validity of any policy purportedly adopted by such
     a means.

     randy (with apologies for being a stickler as usual)

                               JOBS_BBS

     The JOBS_BBS is a "speciality" BBS.  It focuses  on topics
     that merge with my personal and professional interests.
     Specifically, it is limited to the Employment Profession,
     individuals who are looking for an Employer, Employers look-
     ing for Employees, Employee/Employer Relations and the pro-
     motion and growth of the phenomenon of Electronic Mail.  If
     you are not a recruiter, an employer, or looking for a new
     job, there still may be message areas that are of interest
     to you.

     If you are looking for a job or have a job to fill, have em-
     ployee/employer relations concerns or interests, you are
     very welcome and invited to participate.

     Ken Zwaschka and Associates is an Executive Recruiting firm
     based in Portland, Oregon.  We do searches for client compa-
     nies throughout the United States.  All of our expenses are
     paid by those companies.  Most (over 95%) of the searches we
     perform are for food processing companies.  Even within that
     industry, our searches tend to be very unique and special-
     ized.  Unless you are a professional in the food processing
     industry, it is unlikely we will be able to place you in a
     new position or directly find you employment, but we or
     other individuals who visit the JOBS_BBS might be able to
     refer you to someone who can help.

     I started the JOBS_BBS as an extension of my fast growing
     addiction for E-Mail and all of the possibilities it pro-
     vides for communication.

     The sysop and the other participants in this JOBS_BBS are
     interested in helping individuals maximize their employment
     potential and are happy to provide any advice or comments to
     help.  This can include, but is not limited to resume and
     interview suggestions, how to find the "right" job for you,
     and how to optimize conditions in the job you have now.

     Employment oriented files for downloading are limited at
     this time but do include the following:

                 Resume.doc - A sample resume that works
                        (developed over ten years of recruiting
                         plus ten years as a hiring manager)
                 feepaid.txt - A list, with address and owners of
                         all the employer fee paid search firms
                         in Oregon. (updated quarterly)

     The following Message areas are "local" to the JOBS_BBS:

           JOBS-NOW:  A "read only" area that lists all job
                      openings posted in all the other echos the
                      JOBS_BBS carries.  Updated daily, all
     FidoNews 6-22                Page 23                  29 May 1989


                      messages deleted after 30 days so most jobs
                      will still be open.  Currently there are
                      over 150  job openings from all over the
                      country

           RESUMES:  A listing of resumes only from all other
                      echos carried on the JOBS_BBS.  Uploads are
                      allowed.  Currently over 100 resumes listed

     In addition, we carry PDX.JOBS, Net 105's discussion area
     for Employment issues; the National FidoNet JOBS, CONSULT-
     ING, and BUSINESS echos, and four excellent job oriented
     message areas from USENet.

     There is NO CHARGE OF ANY KIND for EMPLOYERS AND CANDIDATES
     to use the services of the JOBS_BBS.  Because the JOBS_BBS
     is operated as a service of a professional search firm, we
     do charge a contingent "brokerage" fee to recruiters and em-
     ployment agencies that use the JOBS_BBS.  Complete details
     are posted in the Bulletins when you log on.

     Although not really relevant to this article, the sysop of
     the JOBS_BBS is a Paradox Database user.  The JOBS_BBS also
     carries a discussion area called Paradox as part of the ser-
     vices of the Portland, Oregon Paradox User's Group.  I would
     be happy to arrange a echo-link for PARADOX echo, along with
     the JOBS_NOW, and RESUME echos to any sysop who is inter-
     ested in carrying them.  Just send a FidoNet Mail message to
     me at 1:105/54.

     The Veterinarian's Corner
     Excerpts from the ANIMED GroupMail Conference

     by Don Thomson, 1:102/1005


     If there was ONE area of preventative care, outside of
     vaccination, that I would reccommend to improve the quality of a
     pet's life, it would be recommending rountine dental care. By the
     age of four years, approximately 60% of all cats, and 40% of
     dogs, have significant dental tarter and gingivitis that will
     soon cause periodontal disease and gum recession.

     Preventative dental care for pets, just like humans, begins at
     home. "What? Brush my dog's teeth?!!" The answer is a resounding
     "YES!" I don't recommend using toothpaste (except possibly those
     that are specifically formulated for pets) but rather use
     WHATEVER your pet LIKES! For pets, it is far more important to
     mechanically remove the soft plaque and trapped food particles
     regularly than it is to use 'the cavity fighter' toothpaste.
     Believe it or not, dental caries ("cavities") are much less of a
     problem in pets than is the aforementioned periodontal disease.

     I recommend twice a week brushings, about 1-2 minutes to briefly
     remove what you can. If your dog likes milk, dip the toothbrush
     in milk, if it likes chicken broth, use chicken broth. Reward it
     after brushing with a small crunchy snack..... You will find that
     dogs will soon look forward the attention and the reward! Just
     keep the experience as positive as possible and use lots of
     praise. Obviously this is most easily done early in training,
     than trying to fight with a 12 year old 'set in it's ways', but I
     have had clients with enough patience to slowly train their 14
     year-old poodle to sit quietly while they raised the cheeks and
     lightly brushed the teeth and gums.

     Cats are a bit tougher, but they too can be coaxed with kindness
     and rewards. I will have to be honest, one of my cats absolutely
     refuses even my most patient attempts. I find that she needs
     routine dental scaling under a sedative or light anesthesia to
     remove the calcified tarter, as I cannot brush the plaque away.

      Other simple priciples:

     1. Keep meals as dry and crunchy as possible to minimize plaque.

     2. Be aware that smaller dogs are much more prone to dental
     disease than are large dogs. Make sure that a dental examination
     is part of your dogs regular health checkup.

     3. Over the years I have changed my beliefs about bones. I have
     seen too many cracked teeth and removed too many bones lodged in
     the stomach or intestines to reccomend bone and other
     FidoNews 6-22                Page 25                  29 May 1989


     'swallowable' chews. I feel pretty good about recommending a
     large Nylon chew bone, or hard crunchy treats. Maybe some day I
     too will find problems relating to a swallowed nylon bone.
     Regular brushing is FAR more beneficial than these chews, and
     much less hazardous.

     4. If your pet developes tarter and/or gingivitis, schedule a
     routine dental scaling and polishing with your veterinarian.
     Veterinarians are making tremendous strides in dental techniques
     and oral surgery. There are now even 'specialty practices' only
     for dentistry! In our practice we even have the capabilities to
     perform root canals.

     MOST of the expensive procedures can be circumvented by routine
     brushing and diet management at home in combination with
     examination and routine tarter removal by a qualified
     veterinarian.
