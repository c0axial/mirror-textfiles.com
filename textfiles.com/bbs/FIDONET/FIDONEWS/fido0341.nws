     Jerry  Hindle  (Sysop  of Space Station Earth Fido) and I would
     like to invite all system operators to provide another  service
     to their non-IBM users.

     The  Space  Station Earth (1-901-353-4563) will be carrying ALL
     Fido Newsletters archived with CBM ARC  134.   This  is  a  new
     utility  program  developed by Ampere Metal and released to the
     public as Shareware.  Arc V1.34 is very similar to  the  MS-DOS
     version  but,  unfortunately, NOT compatable (too bad).  I have
     been told it will do almost everything its  big  brother  will,
     though  I  do  not  have  the  capability  to  conferm this for
     myself.

     As a test, I archived  two  FidoNews  files  totaling  313  CBM
     blocks (a CBM block is 255 bytes).  The resultant combined file
     was only ten blocks longer than one  of  the  individual  files
     (186  blocks  to  be  exact).   This  represents  a substantial
     savings  of  disk  space  reguardless  of  which  type,  and  a
     substancialy reduced download time for each file (especially if
     your users are using 300 baud).

     The authors of CBM Arc have promised to keep the program upward
     compatable, so that an archive created with version 1.34 may be
     unpacked with later versions.  I believe that  version  2.2  is
     already  released.   I  will  continue  to  use version 1.34 to
     create these FidoNews Archives because of this compatability.

     Another feature of CBM ARC is that once the file is  downloaded
     your users will be able to read the news without printing it or
     de-arc'ing it.  Arc allows its user to print a file  within  an
     archive to the SCREEN!

     As  of  this  writing,  there are about thirty five newsletters
     currently available in CBM ARC form from the Station.  ALL will
     be  available as soon as time permits.  Unfortunately, it takes
     time to download the old files, achive them, and upload the arc
     file back to the Station.

     I  try to have the current weeks newsletter uploaded in CBM ARC
     form by Wednesday of each week, but if  you  are  polling  long
     distance,  I  suggest  you  wait until Friday mornings national
     mail slot.  All CBM ARC FidoNews files will carry the file name
     Fidonews                     Page 3                   27 Oct 1986


     of  fn***cbm.arc.  (*** is the current week) They are available
     from the FidoNews File area on the Space Station.

     I am committed to Commodore and to FidoNet.  I believe both can
     work  together.  I hope this service will "bear fruit" for both
     you as a sysop and your users.

     Finally, please take a moment to pay for your  shareware.   The
     Commodore   64   File  Archive  Utility  and  Text  Editor is a
     copyrighted program by Ampere  Metal.   The  program  has  been
     released  to the public as shareware and is also available from
     the Space Station in the alternate computer file  area.   Users
     of CBM ARC are asked to make a modest contribution to:

     Fido 123/6

                        FidoNet One Users Opinion

     I  am  a  user of the Space Station Earth Fido (1-901-353-4563)
     here in Memphis, Tenn. and it seems to  me  some  things  about
     FidoNet  and  IFNA  have  been  left unsaid.  I propose here to
     explore some of these things.

     Probably the most important thing  which  I  believe  is  being
     overlooked  and  is the purpose of running a Fido BBS System or
     any other one for that matter.

     I believe most sysop's will agree with me that the  purpose  of
     their boards are to SERVE THEIR USERS!  This is one of the most
     unselfish things that one  human  being  can  do  for  another.
     After all most FIDO boards represent an investment of well over
     two thousand dollars and in some cases this investment tops the
     ten  thousand dollar mark just for the machinery to operate the
     board!  So my hat is off to ALL you Sysop's who toil  long  and
     hard to keep your boards running smoothly!  That said now on to
     the meat of the situation.

     What should be the main thrust of IFNA?

     Opinion - The bottom line is to SERVE THE USERS!  How you  ask?
     I  believe  the most basic necessity to serve is COMMUNICATION!
     After all, what is the first thing that is done during a  civil
     emergency?    Simply   to  establish  the  best  communications
     possible.  IFNA has growing pains in this area.  As a user  who
     reads  the  FidoNews(tm)  each week, I have been concerned over
     several things  regarding  the  bickering  over  IFNA.   First,
     until  recently  I  never  heard of ANY of the officers of this
     net.  It seems to me the Fido community has the tools  (meaning
     the  newsletter) to keep everyone (not just sysops) informed as
     to what is going on in "St. Louis" and everywhere else for that
     matter.   My  question  is  why haven't the "boys in St. Louis"
     taken the time before now to write at least a monthly insert in
     the news telling everyone what is going on?  Please do not take
     offense at my using the term "boys in St. Louis" because it  is
     not  used  in a negative way.  I simply do not want to take the
     space to mention everyone by name (most I don't  know  anyway).
     Secondly,  I  have  not read very many articles from just plain
     users of FIDO on the subject of IFNA .  It does take some  time
     to sit down at your system and write an article, but it is well
     worth it!  We live in a society that is founded on  freedom  in
     whatever  form.   Freedom  demands that you are important! Your
     ideas are IMPORTANT! After all, you may have  the  answer  that
     everyone  has been looking for!  What is the readership of this
     newsletter?  Someone estimated 300,000.  Whether high or low, I
     know  there  are  a lot more people out there with opinions and
     CONSTRUCTIVE criticism. Take a few minutes and write it down for
     all to hash over, Please?

     How should the money collected by IFNA be spent?

     Opinion - This is not as tough a question to answer if a little
     logic is involved.  In FidoNews 337, Ken Kaplan stated that his
     phone  bills run around 400 dollars a month to support the net.
     How many of you reading this article would be willing to  spend
     FOUR  HUNDRED  dollars a month of YOUR OWN MONEY to do this job
     (and it is a JOB!).  Ken, a personal note to you - You have  my
     deep  and sincere gratitude for your efforts. Again, the bottom
     line is the money should be used to defray the cost of  running
     the  net.   I  consider phone bills a MAJOR part of the cost of
     running this net!  I believe that part of the  money  collected
     from  USERS(annual fee), should be sent to support the network.
     If that means increasing the Fido annual fee  by  five  or  ten
     dollars  so  be  it.   Let us all realize that the "boys in St.
     Louis" have labored long and hard to keep this  net  going  and
     deserve  much better treatment than I have read in the last few
     weeks!!  After all, there would not be a net without them!

     How should the money collected by IFNA be administered?

     Opinion - I believe there should be a Treasurer.   Not  that  I
     distrust anyone, but look at almost all other organizations.  I
     doubt that you will find very many of them that do  not  use  a
     treasurer.  It merely provides a central point for disbursement
     of general funds.  Some people have advanced the idea that only
     annual  reports  need  be  made.  I disagree with this idea.  I
     think that  treasurer  reports  generated  at  the  very  least
     quarterly  are  in  order.   Further,  these  reports should be
     published in the newsletter to provide the  easiest  access  to
     this  information  by general users.  Yes, I said users because
     this information should be available to ALL.

     Should IFNA be a democratic organization or not?

     Opinion -  I  say  YES,  with  qualifications.   Fido  Software
     already  provides the means to this end - The Questionaire. The
     qualification is that maybe there needs to be a utility program
     written  to provide a voting questionnaire to only IFNA members
     when they log on the their favorite board. Alternately, perhaps
     the  voting should only be handled by the host of each net.  On
     further thought, if all voting was handled  by  the  host  then
     there would not be any question as to one man one vote (someone
     would not be able to vote more than once on  separate  boards).
     If  the  general  consensus  is  that  IFNA should be a service
     organization then ok,  but  there  should  be  some  method  of
     "checks and balances".  By this I mean, every officer should be
     accountable  to  the  general  membership  for   "questionable"
     expenses (is paranoia setting in?).

     I have typed long enough, its your turn now. It's three o'clock
     in the morning(sound familiar?).   Discussion  and/or  rebuttal
     can be sent to me at Fido 123/6.

     Robert A. Rudolph
     Fido 109/628

                  PrintQ - a Printer Spooler without Peer


     Mainframers have known for many years that spooling slower input
     and output led to efficiencies in operation and better control
     over some forms of output. As a long-time Mainframer, I have
     only recently entered the world of micros, and have found that,
     while they are good for lots of things (like running Fido), the
     available printer support was not all that I would have hoped.

     At least that is how it was until last week, when I ordered and
     installed PrintQ. Prior to this time I have suffered with either
     DOS Print or something that the various software packages have
     had to print documentation (usually not much more than a TYPE
     command redirected), and have been rather frustrated with the
     shortcomings of all these approaches.

     I had also tried a few RamDisk based "spoolers", and discovered
     that, while they did work after a fashion, restartability (when
     one kid tripped over the power cord) and capacity left a LOT to
     be desired, and I never did find one that had what I considered
     adequate forms control.

     PrintQ does not use tons of memory. PrintQ does not interfere
     with (and is not interfered with by) Fido. PrintQ can store up
     to 64 MEGAbytes of printout (should you want to be that silly).
     PrintQ starts up at autoexec and just works - it even handles
     the PrtSc function gracefully, and is clever enough that it can
     spool PrintShop output and reproduce it up to 255 copies.

     PrintQ will keep various reports or other outputs separated by
     form type, and understands that not all forms are created equal
     in length. You can View a listing to determine if you really
     want to Print it. You can force queue entry number 47 to be the
     next item printed. You can simply leave your printer off for a
     while and nothing will get lost. You can output to ASCII files
     (PrintQ keeps its output highly compressed to save your precious
     disk space) anything that could have been printed. If you run a
     business, you can maintain a PrintQ queue for each business so
     reports and forms don't get mixed.

     You can even just install it and ignore it - it will let your
     programs run faster as they now will not have to wait on the
     printer, and it will never hit a queue limit of 32 files, as
     will DOS print. Furthermore if you run mostly unattended, you
     can be sure that your listings are good - if you get a paper
     jam, you just clear it and tell PrintQ to start at the top of
     the last page you can read. You can even tell it to print its
     reports and then HOLD them so if one gets lost it is reprint
     time but not rerun time. It can even handle cut sheet stationery
     and be told to pause before each new page so you can do forms
     setup for each new page.

     Fidonews                     Page 8                   27 Oct 1986


     It costs around $90, but is worth every nickel - once you have
     had it for half a day you'll wonder what you ever did before,
     and you will probably make all your friends MISERABLE because
     they won't have it. Yet.

     In short, it does the things us mainframers have come to expect
     from print spoolers, does them quickly and well with less over-
     head than DOS Print, and can do GOOD THINGS for output quality
     and rerun reduction. Try it for 30 days from SDI - if you find
     it does not do all these things send it back - they'll refund
     the cost.

     Oh yes - one last thing - no copy protection schemes to make
     backup hard.

                           The LAST RESORT BBS
                       Chattanooga, TN  FIDO 18/16

                Putting 640K on a 64K/256K Xt MotherBoard

     I recently got my first IBM computer.  It is a PC/XT and it  came
     with 256k. I got my hands on a copy of an IBM internal Forem from
     their  employee bulletin board system.  It contained a discussion
     which  ran over the period of a year and a half.  The  discussion
     centered  around  how to get 640k on a 64k/256k  XT  motherboard.
     After  many attempts they were successful.  This modification  is
     not  documented or supported by BIG BLUE,  but it works,  and  it
     looks   as   if  it  were  pre-planned.   The  following   simple
     modification  took  me about 45  minutes when I finally  got  the
     knowledge and parts necessary.

      1. Remove   the cover and motherboard.  The  motherboard  is
         held  down  by  a  couple  of  screws,   and  some  slide
         fasteners. Remove the screws, slide the board to the left
         until  it  releases  and lift out.  Be sure to remove all
         cards and unplug the power supply before trying to remove
         the motherboard.

      2. Place a 74LS158  in the only open socket on the board. It
         is socket U84  and  is near the  left  floppy  drive when
         installed.

      3. Solder a  jumper between 1 and 2 on jumper pad  E2.   The
         jumper pad is normally near the power supply, and this is
         why   the  motherboard  should  be  removed  to  do   the
         modification.

      4. Set dip switches 3 and 4 to the off position.

      5. Remove the ram from banks 0 and 1 marked on the board and
         insert  256k dynamic rams,  41256,  in their place.   the
         board  should now have 41256  rams in banks 0 and  1  and
         4164 (64k) rams in banks 2 and 3.

      6. Put the machine back together and power up with 640k.


     NOTE. This will not work with the PC.  It works with the 64k/256k
     XT board only. That means that it will also work on the portable,
     because it has the same board.   I  can't promise that your  luck
     will be as good as mine, or that you won't damage something while
     doing  the modification.  The modification will surely void  your
     warranty  also.   All I can say is that  the  modification  works
     flawlessly for me.

                                   Good luck,
                                   Bob Dallis

          Hello Again;

          Well, I have been on the phone with the FidoUtil author for the
     last 45 minutes and the gist of the whole conversation was simply
     this:

          QUOTE FROM MARSHALL PRESNELL "Since they haven't bothered to
     even ATTEMPT to register any copies of FidoUtil, I am FORCED to stop
     updates. I was literally betting my computer on FidoUtilities success
     and to DATE I have had only 4 registrations out of OVER 497 KNOWN
     copies of FidoUtil."

          I tend to agree with Mr. Presnell on this one, I know for a fact
     that there are only 4 registrations since I am one of those! If you
     are interested here are the stats on FU.

               Initial Release (version 1.00) SENT to various Regions and
     Net Host around the WORLD! Marketing studies returned 497 (this
     represents ALMOST half of the ENTIRE network! Registrations generated
     3 paid, 1 complimentary (mine) TOTAL INCOME $45  TOTAL expenditures
     $200+ Net income -$155 (a loss)

               Second release (version 1.10) SENT to the same systems as
     initial release. TOTAL INCOME $0  TOTAL EXPENDITURES $200+ NET INCOME
     -$155 (again a loss)

          Marshall was literally betting his system on this one. He was
     using a LOANER machine to operate on with the HOPES of getting enough
     money to eventually purchase a machine. Well, thanks to the 493
     persons who are probably STILL using FidoUtil FREE this will not
     happen. He has had to give up the loaner and until he can figure a
     way to get the $$$$ there WILL BE NO UPDATES to EITHER FidoUtil or
     SMARTMAN (the automatic sysop)

          To the 3 other registrants of FidoUtil Mr. Presnell sends a
     personal THANKS, to the rest of you DEADBEATS who are using something
     for nothing he sends a warning, and I quote here   "If those persons
     who fail to honestly reimburse authors for shareware continue the
     trend, there will soon be ONLY commercial software for the IBM".

          I say this, "The Commodore 64 was once the largest selling home
     computer in the world, it also had a HUGE amount of shareware
     floating around for it, but the same lackluster attitude contributed
     greatly to its fall from grace. Authors must make a living too.
     Granted most shareware authors work a steady job, BUT they also
     Fidonews                     Page 12                  27 Oct 1986


     market and distribute programs for others that could well be SOLD to
     a commercial house for a profit. They do this because they want to
     try to help out, while still making a SMALL bit for their effort. I
     fear that the shareware market for the IBM is heading the same way,
     DOWN. If this happens it could get EXPENSIVE to maintain your little
     hobby.

          If only 20.1% of the total KNOWN copies of FU had registered it
     would have been considered a success. To date only .008% have
     registered their copies of FU. Had FU been a success Marshall would
     have released Smartman (a FANTASTIC PROGRAM (( DEMO AVAILABLE ))) as
     a shareware item too. As it is Smartman is a STRICTLY commercial
     venture and ANY updates past 1.2 of FU will be available to
     REGISTERED USERS ONLY!!!!!

          Tom Jennings has intentions of charging for some part or all of
     version 12. Why cause you DEADBEATS almost refuse to pay for a good
     thing even if you continue to use it. Thom Henderson tried the
     shareware approach with ARC. This cured him REAL FAST. He has
     received only a small handful of registrations to a program that I
     will venture to say resides on EVERY IBM in the world, and gets used
     extensively by same. His next venture (SEADog) was COMMERCIAL ONLY!

          John Warren has apparently (correct me if I am wrong here)
     decided to call it QUITS. He has not been heard from regarding any
     updates to Listgen for quite some time now.

          Procomm enjoys little better success as does Qmodem or
     GenericTerm. The list goes on and on. These authors are getting sick
     and tired of trying to help out for FREE.

          There is a moral to this little soapbox speech. If you can
     honestly say you DO NOT USE any of the above mentioned programs ALONG
     with the countless others out there for the asking then you are
     either RICH and buy everything commercial ONLY, or you are telling a
     LIE ! The moral is this, "If you continue this trend then you had
     better start saving every penny you can get because the CHEAPEST
     commercial software for the IBM that is any good starts at around
     $200 per program and goes up from there. I venture to say that if the
     worst happens then the average IBM owner will purchase about 2
     programs a YEAR. He will eventually get tired of having to BUY the
     high priced stuff, pirating will surely go up, software will go up to
     help cover the costs of lost sales to pirates, pirating will go up
     again and soon everyone in the world will be either a crook or broke
     or BOTH! THINK ABOUT IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!

          Now for a final note, Any requests for software regarding FU or
     Smartman should be directed to me @ 123/6 or 123/0. Since Marshall
     has had to go OFF-LINE he has asked me if I will handle the mail for
     him on these 2 programs. If you request FU, you will be sent a nice
     little note telling you how to get it. If you request Smartman then
     you will again get another note detailing how to get a FULL WORKING
     COPY, the demo file I have is severely limited in scope and uses. It
     is designed to give you just a small taste of WHAT the full fledged
     version can do. I will not file attach either of these programs out,
     if you want them you will have to call to get them from me. If you

     wish to PURCHASE A REGISTERED COPY of either program then you will
     need to send the following to Marshall Presnell:

          To get a SMARTMAN send $ 55 to:
                                         Marshall Presnell

                                         ATTN: Smartman

          To get FidoUtil send $ 15 to:
                                       Marshall Presnell

          To obtain the SOURCE code to FU send $ 40 INSTEAD of the $15

          Well I guess I have rambled on enough for now. I continue to
     emphatically assert the authors RIGHTS to charge for shareware (after
     all shareware , unlike FREEWARE, IS NOT FREE) and will continue my
     little speeches on this subject until I am either forced out of
     FidoNews and the Net (unlikely to say the least) or you start showing
     me that you can live up to your end of the shareware bargain and PAY
     the small price for the stuff you use !

     Thanks may be sent to me @123/6.
     Registrations may be sent to the AUTHORS OF THE RESPECTIVE PROGRAMS
     INVOLVED (see the docs on your program for the address)
     Complaints and GRIPES may be filed under "who cares"

                   Part 1: Review of the Commodore 128 PC


        Since the large majority of BBS users are Commodore owners,  I
     find  it  strange  that there are little or no Commodore-oriented
     articles here in the FidoNews.  So,  without further ado,  I will
     attempt  to satisfy their demands and start a little column of my
     own for them.  They will,  for  the  most  part,  deal  with  the
     Commodore  64  and 128 computers.  For Amiga news...  anyone else
     out there wanna take a stab at this?

        We'll start by reviewing the Commodore  128  PC  itself,  with
     accompanying hardware.  The Commodore 128 is a fairly new machine
     developed  by  the  same folks that gave the world the 64,  which
     introduced inexpensive computing to  the  "common  folk".  It  is
     actually  three  computers  in one.  For those that have made the
     upgrade from a 64 to a 128, good news: one of the three computers
     inside this wonderful machine is the good old 64, meaning you can
     run all your favorite games, applications, and the like.

        The second of the three machines is the new "128 mode",  which
     gives  the  BASIC programmer 122K of space in which to play.  New
     software developed for this new mode will probably take advantage
     of the increased memory.  Also available soon  is  the  1750  RAM
     expansion,  which  boosts the 128 up to 640K of RAM.  Not bad for
     an 8 bit machine.  You can use this  mode  in  either  40  or  80
     columns  (you  can  also  use the double-speed 2 MHz mode with 80
     columns).  The world of 2400 baud modems is  now  open!  Could  a
     128 implementation of Fido be imminent?  Somehow I doubt it...

        The third mode is something a lot of people are familiar with:
     CP/M.  Yes,  we can even use most (not quite all) of the programs
     CP/M users have come to know and love/hate.  To do this,  a  Z-80
     chip  is  resident  inside the machine,  and a new disk drive was
     developed: the 1571.

        The 1571 can be used in any of the three modes,  though in  64
     mode it performs like the (slow) 1541.  This is a high speed disk
     drive  folks!  Yes,  from  Commodore.  Unbelievable  you  say?  I
     guess you'll have to trust me  on  this  one.  It  delivers  high
     speed data transfer in either 128 or CP/M modes, and in CP/M mode
     it  has  an added plus:  compatibility with the industry standard
     MFM  disk  format.   Disks  formatted  with  the  FORMAT  command
     provided will be formatted in the native GCR format,  but you can
     still read and write from/to Kaypro,  Epson,  Osborne,  IBM (CP/M
     86),  and  other disks.  Most software will run with little or no
     modifications (I've already fallen in love  with  NSWP  and  LU),
     though  there are still a few bugs to be ironed out.  So far I've
     Fidonews                     Page 15                  27 Oct 1986


     had no trouble.  Of course, my limited experience with MS-DOS has
     helped me adjust quite a bit:  God  help  those  poor  souls  who
     aren't  used to simply typing the program name and having it load
     and execute!

        As far as printers go,  Commodore  now  offers  the  MPS-1000,
     which  is a fairly high speed beast and will run straight off the
     serial port (the 128 uses a DIN connector),  or from RS-232  (the
     real thing this time!), meaning Amiga and non-Commodore users can
     use it.  However,  I picked up the Panasonic 1080 printer,  and a
     Xetec Super Graphix Interface,  and I am quite happy.  The Xetec,
     by  the  way,  offers full Commodore 1525 emulation,  so all your
     existing software will print properly if it  supported  the  1525
     (most  do).  You  can  also  download  different  fonts  into the
     interface,  and about 15 are provided (along with a program which
     enables you to design your own).

        The  RGB monitor is the Commodore 1902.  This is much superior
     to the old 1702 in that you can direct-connect it to the  128  to
     view the 80 column RGB output.  For those who don't know what RGB
     is,  it  is  basically  a mode in which the three primary colours
     (Red, Green,  and Blue) are sent to the monitor over three lines,
     and  three  (instead  of the usual one) electron guns "paint" the
     screen, giving crisp, sharp detail as Commodore owners have never
     seen before.  This monitor will ALSO connect to the  standard  40
     column input and display accordingly (you must, however, flip the
     front  switch to either SEPARATED or COMPOSITE,  depending on how
     you connected).  She's quite nice.

        Finally,  Commodore now offers two new modems.  There  is  the
     inexpensive 1660 Modem/300, which delivers 300 baud at a very low
     price.  Better (and more expensive) is the 1670 Modem/1200, which
     is  fully Hayes compatible and is colour coordinated to match the
     128, and is also quite compact in size.  However, I decided to go
     with the Taihaho Lynker's Modem 1200,  as I was able to get it on
     sale complete with Commodore interface.  This modem has performed
     flawlessly,  but there is one problem which is common to ANY 1200
     baud modem connected to a 64 or 128.  There  are  internal  clock
     timing  differences  between  machines.  The  difference  is very
     small, but shows up at high speeds.  This is due to the fact that
     the Commodore does not have a UART chip,  but instead drives  RS-
     232  via software interrupts.  Any difference in timing can cause
     garbled  data.  There  IS  a  solution:  the  lo-byte  baud  rate
     character  can  be "trimmed" to work correctly with your machine.
     Best results are a value between 55 and 69 (my machine uses  65).
     The problem: most terminal programs don't let you play with this.
     One  I  know of does:  Bobsterm Pro 128,  which I'll review in my
     next column.

        If you own a 64, and want to do more,  THIS is the alternative
     for you.  The 128 will work with all your old peripherals (though
     the 1541 is rather slow with CP/M,  and WON'T read MFM disks), so
     the upgrade can be very inexpensive.  The added  RAM  means  your
     programs  can be longer and do more.  The BASIC 7.0 that operates
     in 128 mode  is  a  dream  to  work  with.  There  are  over  140
     different  commands  at  your  disposal,  including  all  the DOS
     Fidonews                     Page 16                  27 Oct 1986


     commands that were available on  the  BASIC  4  on  the  old  PET
     machines.  Check it out!  And bring your chequebook!


        I'm interested in answering any of your questions about either
     the 64 or 128.  If you are having a problem,  please address your
     mail to Joe Lindstrom via Calgary Fido (Net 134 Node 1), and I'll
     address it in an upcoming article.

     Christopher Baker
     Metro-Fire Fido 135/14 (0) XP:


                   It's Convenient but is it Necessary?


     The PRIVATE flag should NOT be the default setting in your
     CONFIG.DOG, fellow SEAdog capable Sysops. The MAJORITY of the
     mail I send to and receive from SEAdog Nodes contains NO
     sensitive or restricted info, so, WHY mark it 'Private'?

     It has always been my impression that the purpose of BBSing and
     mail is to communicate AND disseminate information to the
     largest number of people possible. Setting Private as the
     default for all outgoing mail defeats this purpose.

     If it IS necessary for a message to be Private, add this flag to
     the message before you save it. Don't compromise my board with
     Private messages that would serve and enlighten a wider audience
     if they were sent in the open. What will happen if the Electronic
     Communications Act says I cannot unPrivate a message without the
     sender's consent?

     I'm sure most of these Private messages (especially from HELP
     Nodes) are not intended by their authors to be restricted
     information. I'm sure it's just a BAD habit being exacerbated by
     the ability to set certain message bits as default in the
     SEAdog configuration.

     This is in the WANTED section, so what do I want? I want you to
     CUT IT OUT. Unless every message you send out is filled with
     voice telephone numbers or credit card numbers or some other
     sensitive information that should not be dispersed to every
     corner of Fido, take the PRIVATE flag out of your CONFIG.DOG and
     Private the mail that needs it on a message by message basis.

     Thanks, I needed that.

     Flames and conflicting opinions may be addressed to me at
     135/14(0) or in this forum.
