                                 This Is It!

        This is the week we've all been waiting for!  On Wednesday, 
        12 June 1985, we switch over to regional nets.  Stay on net 
        one until Wednesday, then set your net and node numbers to 
        the new system before the Thursday morning national mail 
        hour.  Also, pick up a copy of the new node list (136), and 
        install it on your system Wednesday.

        I'd also advise everybody to set their alternate net and 
        node numbers to their old node in net one, just in case 
        someone sends you mail at your old address.  Keep it like 
        that for a week, maybe two, then the heck with it.  Anybody 
        who hasn't converted by then, too bad.  

        It's taken awhile to get here, and I know it's going to 
        cause some confusion, but I really believe it'll be worth it 
        in the long run (say, a month or two).  

        The latest word I have is that John Warren isn't going to 
        have the new LISTGEN program (which replaces NODELIST and 
        ROUTEGEN) ready by Wednesday, so the guys in St. Louis won't 
        be distributing the new format nodelist after all.  Instead,

        they are going to run the new format list through a program 
        that'll use it to create an old format list, which they'll 
        then pass around.  

        This means that network hosts and regional coordinators 
        should send in new format lists to St. Louis, but St. Louis 
        is going to send out old format lists.

        This may seem a little confusing, because it IS a little 
        confusing.  But if this is the worst we have to contend 
        with, then we have it made.

                             Coordinators List
                          by Ben Baker -- Fido 76

             There  has  been  some  confusion  about the difference
        between a "network" and a "region." Let me try to shed  some
        light.

             The  network,  as  we  use  the  term here, is merely a
        formalization of an informal concept that  has  been  around
        since  Fido  version 7.  Fido has known since then that when
        told to do so, he should send mail addressed to  node  A  to
        node  B  instead.   The  advent  of  "routing" permitted the
        formation  of  informal  structures   known   variously   as
        "regional nets" or "area nets" or simply "nets." They vary a
        great deal in form and complexity, but they share one  thing
        in  common.   They  each  have one node defined as "in-bound
        host" who receives the mail for all members.

             We have now given these  networks  a  formal  identity.
        When the node list appears in the new format, Fido will know
        about all the networks, who the host of each is,  and  which
        nodes are members.  Without being told he will automatically
        send mail for any member to the network host.   The  network
        number will be part of the identity of every member node.

             This was done for several reasons.  Many nodes were not
        taking advantage of routing.  Now it'll  be  automatic.   It
        will make it easier for private networks (there are several)
        to interface with the public net.  Perhaps  most  important,
        it  permits  us  to  decentralize  control of FidoNet's only
        official document, the node list.   Because,  in  the  past,
        node  numbers  had  to  be  unique,  one  person  had  to be
        responsible for node list  maintenance,  a  task  which  has
        become  too  big for one unpaid volunteer.  Now numbers need
        only be unique within a network.  Different networks may use
        the same numbers with no ill effects.

             Thus, network hosts may administer their own node lists
        and the national coordinator merely collects  and  assembles
        the pieces into a complete node list.

             But  what of the more than 100 independant nodes around
        the country?  The region allows us to divide them  into  ten
        geographic groupings called Regions.  A region is a numbered
        entity much like a network, with a coordinator to manage its
        node  list.   The  only  difference  is that a region has no
        in-bound host.  Mail to all members is sent direct,  without
        routing.

             The  following  table  is  a  list  of  all regions and
        networks and their assigned coordinators.  Also included  is
        their current Fido node numbers, and the net/node address to
        which mail should be sent AFTER  the  cut-over  to  the  new
        scheme.

             From  now  on,  all  requests  for  node numbers should
        contain the same information as before, but should  be  sent
        via FidoNet mail to the appropriate coordinator.

                       GO!  GO!  GO!  -- June 12 is IT
                           by Ben Baker -- Fido 76

             Notice  to  all.   Sometime  during Wednesday, June 12,
        each of us will install his edited copy of the new node list
        and use the '4' command to set his new net or region number.
        If you don't know how to do this, use  '4?'  for  help.   On
        Thursday,  June  13  at  mail time, we will be using the new
        network scheme.

             John Warren has been wearing his fingers down  to  nubs
        on  the  keyboard,  but the new program LISTGEN is not ready
        yet.  As a stop-gap measure, Thom Henderson wrote a  program
        (named  STOPGAP!)  which  we  in St.  Louis will be using to
        translate the new node list format back to  the  traditional
        format,  digestable by Fido.  For a (hopfully short) time we
        will be maintaining the new  fromat,  but  distributing  the
        result in the old format.

             There's  a  catch.   Because  of  the  Host  and Region
        statements, neither NODELIST.EXE nor  ROUTEGEN.EXE  will  be
        able  to  handle  this new format.  That means we go back to
        the old method of editing the node list by hand.   For  most
        of  us,  this  means  stripping  area  codes  from the local
        numbers, and maybe a global edit of the cost column.   Since
        local  numbers  will now be grouped together, this shouldn't
        be too tough.

             Routing files will also have to be generated  by  hand,
        but  except  for  hosts of large networks, that shouldn't be
        too dificult either.  To begin with, independant nodes, that
        is  all region members, won't need any routing files at all.
        Neither will members of networks that don't  have  out-bound
        hosts.   Locals  of  most the rest of the networks can use a
        ROUTE.BBS that looks like this:

             SCHEDULE B <outbound host nbr>
             ROUTE-TO <outbound host nbr>  ALL
             SCHEDULE C ALL
             SCHEDULE D

        where schedules are executed in B-C-D order.

             Most hosts have enough experience with routing  by  now
        to  be  able  to figure out a workable set of routing files.
        Remember,  you  no  longer  have  to  worry  about  national
        routing,  only  routing  within  your network.  Make sure to
        remember  to  include  appropriate  ACCEPT-FROM  statements.
        Careful  examination  of  your  present routing files, those
        created by ROUTEGEN will help.

             A note to all coordinators.  Please try to help  spread
        this information around in your network or region.  And make
        sure your people know that if they don't already  have  V10i
        or higher, they MUST get V10j by Wednesday.

             So  let's  do  it  guys, and get back to normal FidoNet

        ******* WARNING ABOUT DOWNLOADING EXECPCT4.LBR/LQR *********

           It has been brought to our attention that there are bogus 
        programs floating around bulletin boards all over the 
        country. They are as follows: 

                     EXECPCT4.LBR    or     EXECPCT4.LQR

           A PLAGIARIST has changed the name on EXECPC2.x to 
        EXECPCT4.  It is NOT an upgrade to the popular 
        communications program.  The lastest version is EXECPC26 
        (ver. 2.6).  

           Do not waste your valuable time downloading this file!!  
        If you are a sysop and someone has uploaded one of these 
        files to you, find out who it is and try to find out what 
        bulletin board the user downloaded it from.  Then tell the 
        user to notify the sysop of the board he downloaded it from 
        about the bogus version.  To keep the bbs world free of 
        plagiarism, please request that the user deletes this file 
        and make sure it is not uploaded to any board.  

           Included in the library is a doc file that gives a phone 
        number 516-...-.... as The Multi-User Exec-PC BBS!  Everyone 
        knows that the Exec-PC Bbs is in Wisconsin (414-964-5160) or 
        should know it, since it has 6 phone lines, 240 meg of 
        storage and over 3000 files).  The number listed above is an 
        RBBS (numerous version old) where Exec-PC uses its own bbs 
        software.  A fellow sysop called just to check out the 
        number and saw several other files that have had their names 
        changed to appear as an upgrade.  A user spent over 10 
        minutes (at 2400 baud)  of long distance time getting this 
        file!!  

           Also, if you are a sysop, do not delete EXECPC26.  Just 
        delete the so called version 4.  If you have deleted, it is 
        available on this board.  

           It seems that this is becoming a habit with someone... It 
        apparently has also been done to John Friel's program 
        (Qmodem 1.05).  The PLAGIARIST changed the code to give a 
        phone number that is not John's in the welcome screen!  This 
        one I have not seen yet.  John would like to know if anyone 
        sees this version floating around.  

           We need to keep track of who is uploading this junk.  If 
        you find one of these bogus files, let the authors know and 
        publish their names.  

           The bulletin boards around the country are designed for 
        computer hobbiest. To keep this growing network going it is 
        imperative that all programs are legitamite.  What seems to 
        be happening is that people are not respecting the authors 
        copywrights.  As you know plagerism is illegal and 
        punishable by law.  








FIDONEWS     --           10 Jun 85  00:00:43           Page 8

           To combat this problem and to protect the generoisty of 
        public domain authors all sysops should be doing the 
        following: 

            - Set up a verification network
            - Keep an accurate log of all users and their uploads
            - Inform all sysops of any and all bogus programs put on 
              to their system.  
            - If you note a person is invloved in bogus activites, 
              give a stern warning which will ultimately lock them 
              out of every system.  

           Thanks for all your help.
                Mark

        about 10 variations on the IBM PC as well.  But alas, not 
        everyone has the right to ask this question, at least not 
        able to choose which way.  Sure, you may be able to choose a 
        different route but not without shelling out the bucks at 
        first.  Then what you got might turn out to be not what you 
        wanted despite a semming pleasant appearance from the 
        outside.  

            If you haven't guessed it by now, I'm referring to those 
        dreadful pay-to-play BBS programs such as HOSTCOMM, PC-HOST, 
        FoReM-PC, TCOMM, TBBS and a host (no pun) of others.  Prices 
        from $100 to $300 dollars for a disk or two, a manual, and a 
        program that compares as well with Fido or even RBBS as does 
        VisiCalc to Lotus 1-2-3.  There are some nice features 
        there, but for power, flexibility and options the latter is 
        a clear winner.  

            Fido provides an advanced feature of national net-
        working, plus standard bbs features and a host of transfer 
        protocols.  It's price: FREE.  RBBS provides local net-
        working, conferences and doors capability.  It's price: 
        FREE.  These others really contain nothing outstanding as do 
        the two free, standardized board software pacakges I 
        mentioned.  You have two to try out for free.  And if you 
        feel it worth your while you can always contribute what you 
        feel the value of the package is.  

            The others may claim support or speed or something, but 
        their ludicrous prices and lack of strong, unique features 
        makes their purchase almost unreal.  We are operating in a 
        public forum, a public service.  We've already put down a 
        couple thousand for the computer in the first place, why 
        more to allow us to share our PC with others.  

            We must continue to promote the free communications 
        society.  Get people out there to hear about our wonderful 
        toys before they plunk down more cash.  They most likely 
        won't be happy, and I won't be either.

        Co-Sysop Fido #359

            I know you all love your beloved Fido, but there's a new 
        bbs program coming on the market soon.  The name: MILO.  It 
        is NOT an acronym and does NOT contain the letters bbs in 
        it.  About all I can tell you now is that it is unlike 
        anything available for the PC or any other personal computer 
        now available.  

            Why am I telling you this in the Fido newletter.  Well, 
        I'm looking for some more beta-testers.  My work site and 
        another board will be running it soon.  But I would like 
        reactions from sysops and users across the country with no 
        knowledge of its capabilities and workings.  

            At the moment it is not FidoNet compatible (I'm working 
        on it and will greedily take volunteers).  Full source code 
        is provided.  It is written in BetterBASIC (I began work 
        LONG before the article 3 issues ago which mentioned this 
        language and got me upset that someone was 'stealing' my 
        idea.  Can't win 'em all).  Our Fido will be beta-testing 
        the program during the day, and revert to fido when I'm not 
        at work.

            I hope to have the RBBS-->MILO and Fido-->MILO utilities 
        ready soon, to translate user lists and message areas.  
        Also, MILO is 100% fido questionaire compatible, will 
        support your sub-directories (and RBBS' non-sub-
        directories).  It is designed so that either an RBBS or Fido 
        sysop can change quickly without doing a lot of re- 
        organization.  

            So if you're interested in beta-testing the product 
        (which will be public-domain, of course) or have questions, 
        send some mail to 359 or give me a call at work: (301) 340-
        1376.  Hope to hear from you.  When we're fidonet 
        compatible, the net will spread, which is what we all want.  
        This is just an alternative to the fido style.  I think 
        you'll be pleased.  

                                Chris

                             The First FidoBaby

        Ken Kaplan (Fido 51) and his wife Sally now have the first 
        official FidoBaby, named Eric Samuel Kaplan.  Sally wants to 
        wait for awhile before she'll let Ken assign him a node 
        number.  

        We'd like to welcome Eric as the newest and youngest member 
        of the growing Fido family, and offer him our best wishes.  
        We'd also like to extend our congratulations to Ken and 
        Sally.
