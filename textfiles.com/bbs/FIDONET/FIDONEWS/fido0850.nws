I should be asleep. I will be shortly. It's 2:18AM. I am still working
12 hrs/day 7 days/week wiring radio station studios (miles of two-pair
cable, bazillions of XLRs, dozen or so #63 punch-down blocks...). I just
got back tonite at 1:30AM, and have to be there at 9:00AM tomorrow. Half
hour drive. I will be done the end of this week (all's going well, and
on schedule).

So another week of absolutely minimal involvement from me in FidoNews.
Bye!

        "WHEN REMEMBERING IS TOO MUCH ... OR NOT ENOUGH"
                        by G. Joseph Peck
                   VETLink #1 - Pittsfield, MA
                FidoNet 1:321/203  (413) 443-6313

Tears traced their crooked fingers down the paraplegic veterans' face,
wrapped themselves around the stylus held in his mouth, and gently
spiraled towards his computer keyboard.  "Finally," sobbed the veteran,
"Someone who understands what I'm talking about when I mention bouncing
betty's, C-Rats or mad-minutes!  A brother veteran!"  35-minutes later,
telephone wires from his home jumped to life as he connected with a
faraway computer bulletin board (BBS) that was part of FidoNet(tm), a
worldwide network of over 11,000 amateur computer operators, and
delivered his reply to a message he'd read earlier.  The walls around
him slowly began to dissolve as the howling winter wind screamed through
the dark night outside.  He was no longer alone.

After working his eighth consecutive 16-hour day, the tired but restless
veteran found himself again unable to sleep.  Inside his luxurious home,
trophies, plaques and civic awards hung on all the walls.  To all that
knew him, he WAS a success - but still something gnawed at, agitated,
irritated him.  He turned on his computer and called a local FidoNet BBS
to see what new messages had come in that day.

Reaching for her cup of tea, hand brushing a potted plant, the nurse
began to tremble as hot steam and plant leafs reawakened memories of
long-ago hurried footsteps from a medevac helicopter.  Closed in on all
sides by tall jungle grass, the pathway was soon dotted with droplets of
blood and fluids from the battle-wounded soldier she helped carry to the
field hospital.  A wave of relief came over her as she saw the familiar
characters: "Please input your name-" appear on the monitor screen of
her computer.  Quickly, she signed in and navigated her way to an area
of the BBS entitled "VIETNAM_VETS International Echo".  (An "echo" is a
message base that is shared - echoed - from BBS-to-BBS around the
world.)

In March of 1987, G. Joseph Peck, a Pittsfield, MA service-disabled
veteran, veteran activist, and founder/President of Berkshire Veterans'
Center, Inc. (BVCI) - a grassroots electronic veteran service organ-
ization whose Board of Directors also includes members in Herndon, VA;
Katy, TX; Shady Side, MD; Chatsworth, GA and Passaic, NJ - came upon the
International VIETNAM_VETS Echo Conference (IVVEC) which had been
created by Todd C. Looney of San Jose, CA, and added it to the offerings
of VETLink #1, a BVCI-sponsored BBS veteran outreach effort.

In a very short time, BVCI helped create the VETNet echoes - a
collection of veteran-oriented file and message bases - which also soon
began to be shared throughout the U.S. and Canada.  Veterans, spouses
and children of veterans, and those interested in the veteran experience
began sharing and relating their various experiences, their nightmares,
their good times and bad, as well as important veteran information into
the message bases.  Veterans who had long ago lost contact with others
FidoNews 8-50                  Page 3                      16 Dec 1991


they had served alongside found long lost friends and service buddies.
IVVEC and the VETNet echoes began to shine with a truly international
hue as veterans from Canada and Australia added their voices to the
rapidly growing veteran kaleidoscope, and VETLink #1 became the Eastern
hub of the VETNet echoes - which now number 21 and are daily/weekly
growing.

On Veterans' Day, 1987 (11/11/87) Looney and Peck, mindful of the fact
that messages on many BBSs get deleted, created and produced the premier
issue of an electronic newsletter called "NamVet" that would distill
much of the information from the VETNet echoes, include contributions
from echo participants, and add other important information for all
veterans, their families, and those interested and concerned about
America's veterans.  Now Averaging 90-100 pages in length, NamVet
continues to be produced monthly and is in high demand by Vietnam and
other veterans and their families.

With VETLink #1, the VETNet echoes, and NamVet, it appeared that the
work of BVCI was complete and there was nothing left to do but polish up
and keep adding to the offerings of VETLink #1 - among them being
Electronic Service Officers (disabled or other house/homebound veterans
who could devote time and energy towards serving their fellow veterans)
and computerized versions of Department of Veterans Affairs forms for
processing/submitting claims.  The quiet breeze of support, camaraderie
and veteran benefit information that had softly begun to rustle quickly
became a whirlwind as, zephyr-like, more and more veterans discovered
the variety of VETNet echoes and NamVet and soon others began asking
about becoming a VETLink...

Q - "Do I have to be a veteran to operate a VETLink BBS"
A - No.  What we generally look for is a proven record of dedication
    and commitment to veterans and an area of expertise and/or interest
    that will benefit our international audience.

Q - "Is there a specific type of software required for my BBS to be
    functional within the VETNet?"
A - No.  All information and data easily fits within the configuration
    parameters of many BBSs.  Our BBS of choice is OSIRIS because of
    its configurability, flexibility and security provisions.  PLUS,
    all veteran help files and programs are done in OSIRIS ITP
    (Inline-Text-Programming) language which is difficult to modify for
    other BBS types.

Q - "How do I become a VETLink?"
A - Generally, by sending NETMAIL to VETLink #1 at FidoNet 1:321/203
    with your name, address, voice telephone number.  After receipt of
    your NETMAIL, your application is forwarded to the Board of
    Directors of Berkshire Veterans' Center, Inc., sponsor of VETLink #1
    for review and approval.

Q - "Is there anything REQUIRED of me to operate a VETLink BBS?"
A - Yes.  There are 8 BASIC requirements:

    1.  The VETLink BBS SysOp will commit his/her efforts to aid a
        national audience of veterans for a minimum period of
        one (1) year.
    2.  The VETLink BBS SysOp will, in some way, add to the aggregate
        "veteran service" effort of VETLink either through technical
        expertise and/or by creating and moderating a veteran-oriented
        echoconference.
    3.  The VETLink BBS will be operational 24 hours per day at rates
        of 2400bps or higher.
    4.  The VETLink BBS will incorporate the VETLink # into his/her BBS
        name so that others will be able to quickly identify where
        veteran-related BBSs can be found.
    5.  The VETLink BBS will carry all of the VETNet echoes.
    6.  The VETLink BBS will have available the current years issues of
        NamVet - our electronic newsletter for and about veterans.
    7.  The VETLink BBS will collect and transfer to VETLink #1 user
        contributions for NamVet.
    8.  The VETLink BBS will have available a veteran-oriented file area

The VETNet echoes presently consist of: VIETNAM_VETS... by, for and
about veterans - primarily Vietnam veterans - and the issues that
concern them; ISAW... International Studies of American War;
BROWN_WATER... Brown water Navy; MIA-POW... MIA/POW topics;
HOSP_VETS... hospitalized veterans' discussions; KOREAN_VETS... for
veterans of the Korean Conflict; VET_REUNION... veteran reunions;
MILITARY_ISSUE... military discussions; VETREACH... locate missing
service members; IN_TOUCH... sharing families and friends on The Wall;
TOUCH_BACK... reflections on IN_TOUCH experiences; FVVM_NEWS... news
from the Friends of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial; SKY_PILOTS... faith
found in combat; VETERANS_TOO... children of veterans; VETS_FRIENDS...
from non-veterans concerned about veterans; JEWISH_VETERANS... veterans
of the Jewish faith; CHRISTIAN_VET... veterans of the Christian faith;
12STEPS_VETS... veterans and addictions; VETS_JOBTALK... veteran
employment discussions/info; DISABLED_VET... veterans and disability.
As each new VETLink joins, its SysOp generally contributes the
moderatorship of an echo or other form of overall help to veterans.

"Getting veteran news and information out to the public, operated with a
spirit of dedicated and committed care and concern, a VETLink is totally
a volunteer effort on the part of all our VETLink System Operators,"
says Peck.  "I would like to see telephone companies provide 800-
numbers to the VETLink's so that veterans, who have already paid so dear
a price for the freedom we enjoy today, wouldn't have to continue paying
to get the information and camaraderie they've EARNED; I would like to
see Berkshire Veterans' Center, Inc. - a nonprofit 501(c)(3)
organization, listed in the IRS List of Charitable Organizations -
become the recipient of funding because, since its creation, it has only
been supported by my VA Disability Compensation check, donations of
needed equipment and supplies from other VETLink's and members of our
Board of Directors, and small donations from the general public; and I
would really be happy, deep down in my heart, if I knew that any
veteran, no matter where s/he is, could find the information,
camaraderie, support and fellowship they so well earned by virtue of
their military service."

John F. Kennedy once said: "Some men dream dreams and say 'Why?' I dream
dreams and say 'Why not!'"

When all that remains is a stylus to tap-tap-tap out a message; when
memories of yesterday agitate and annoy, and when life-fluids seem to
ebb low, the dream - and hard work -  of G. Joseph Peck, Berkshire
Veterans' Center, Inc., and all VETLink System Operators stand ready for
you and those you care about...

             when remembering is too much -

                                  ... or not enough.

THIS holiday season, if there's a veteran close to you - or if you,
yourself are a veteran wanting to "touch bases" with that unique time in
your life, call a VETLink BBS - they'd be more than glad to have you
share YOU with them...

"Cleaning out the dog house -- a rebuttal"

Billy Cash III - Programmer's Connection BBS - 1:226/70.0

In last week's FidoNews, we heard from a Mr. Frederic L. Rice, of
1:102/901.9.  He states that FidoNet sysops ought to be more careful
about what they keep on their systems, especially pirated software
and pornographic graphics.

     "Boys and girls of the Fido Network, we might have a bit of a
     problem, and it's a problem that, if apathy can be broken, is
     easilly placed out of our need to worry about.

     "After requesting listings of files available on several FidoNet
     systems both locally to mine and among sites around the United
     States, I find that we still have -- many of us -- software
     packages that have not been placed into the public domain yet
     are nonetheless still available for public download."

His advice is to screen uploads, and to go through the entire library
on your system periodically.  He does this now, "if only to protect
my [his own] ass."

FidoNews 8-50                  Page 7                      16 Dec 1991


Here's another quote.

     "[I recommend] Validation of all Users (hack-spit) ages before
     they are granted access to certain GIF files. With a suitable
     comment that the files depict sexual activities and should be
     considered art or something.

     "We must, FidoNet, clean up our act otherwise the commercial mail
     systems that provide end-user to end-user mail services will end
     us for sure. We are in the way and they'll move heaven and earth
     to remove _us_."

I'd like to say that no one will be moving heaven and earth to remove
me for a long time.  Good sysops don't have to worry about any of
this.  I think the blame the bad name bulletin board services have
lies squarely on the shoulders of people like Mr. Rice.

He says that he would have the world fooled into the idea that
bulletin boards are nice, clean places.  But eventually, some
thirteen-year-old will crack his shell, get into his BBS and download
seventeen megabytes of GIF files that "never really existed."  He
doesn't understand that the best way to earn a good reputation is to
act responsibly.

Yes, I think I would help move heaven and earth to remove Mr. Rice.

Because I have nothing to hide.  Do you?

Notice: Missing nodes on AD&D

There are (to my knowledge) 2 or 3 nodes in the 311 net picking up the
AD&D echo. But only the 2 of us (1:311/5 & 1:311/6) are sending any
messages. Are we the only people receiving this echo? If so WHY? we are
interested in getting an AD&D game going. But after over a MONTH, the
ENTIRE base has about 3 messages. 2 from me (1:311/5) & one from
1:311/6. This doesn't seem right to me. So, I'm sending this to let
everyone know, "There IS an AD&D echo in the net & there ARE nodes
receiving it". But Still, Only 2??? Come on people! If you don't have
it, Request the echo-name "AD&D" (Nix the quotes, of course!) & join us
in a friendly AD&D game. We Look forward to seeing you in the Echo.
