     =================================================================
                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================

     Vince foolishly keeps handing me the keys to FidoNews.  Two
     weeks ago, I managed to lose the whole thing while upgrading
     my HD.  (Sorry, Vince!)  This week's adventure is more
     deliberate.

     You probably noticed a change in this week's issue of
     FidoNews, or rather, its packaging.  It was archived using
     LHArc rather than some Arc (r) 5.x compatible program.  (If you
     didn't get it this way, someone between you and 1/1 is screwing
     around, and could well be in violation of Policy.)

     Last Sunday, I was reading the August Dr. Dobb's Journal, and
     was surprised to see an ad from System Enhancement Associates
     on page 170.  It announced the new release of Arc(R), 7.0.  The
     subhead of the ad says "Now with all the features that have
     made ARC(R) the industry standard compression utility".  In
     much smaller print, further in the ad was the following: "NOTE:
     ARC 7.0 is NOT available on BBS".

     I found the first statement to be somewhat oxymoronic, and
     the two taken together even moreso.  (I also wonder if it is
     available on commercial systems, and for this wondering, one
     sysop I know accused me of thinking like a scumbag - er -
     lawyer!  Isn't that slander?)

     Far be it from me to diminish the contribution that Thom
     Henderson and SEA have made to FidoNet.  Despite many personal
     misgivings with his actions in some areas, I have often come to
     his defense.  There are few in the net who appreciate his work
     in the form of Policy 3 as much as I.

     However, it is time for FidoNet as a whole to consider what
     it's all about.  It is not clear to me that Arc(R) is "the
     industry standard".  It is clear to me that FidoNet is an
     amateur electronic mail network.  It is about the free flow
     of information.

     Therefore, I have to ask myself if it is right for FidoNet, on
     a weekly basis, to distribute files that force every sysop in
     the net to use products from a company that has turned its back
     on the very community that helped, in no small degree, to make
     those products as successful as they are.

     With the possible exception of its name, LHArc is legally
     unencumbered.  It exists in Freely Available source code
     format, in relatively portable C.  It does a better job at
     data compression than Arc(R) 5.x, and therefore will save
     FidoNet as a whole on phone costs.  While I haven't seen a spec
     for the algorithms used, nor have I seen one for Arc(R).

     FIDONEWS 7-31                Page 2                   30 Jul 1990


     So, I'm taking a lesson from Thom himself.  I'm going to
     instigate a discussion by just doing something, unilaterally.

     So far as I can tell, there are but two sacrosanct elements in
     FidoNet: FTS-0001 and its amateur status.  Other than that, no
     one is more special than anyone else, and no technology cast
     in concrete.  This is as it should be; otherwise, we'd be
     hog-tied more than we already are by virtue of size.

     I hope that, upon his return, Vince will continue to release
     FidoNews in LHArc format.  I hope the *C structure will switch
     NodeDiff and NodeList distribution files to LHArc format.  And
     I hope the FTSC will formally recognize LHArc (or any Freely
     Available compressor) as the standard for compressed mail
     within FidoNet.

     No matter what, from here on in, NO files on my system will be
     distributed in Arc(R) format, nor will Arc(R) itself be
     available.

     Systems requesting FidoNews, FNews*.Arc, or anything similar
     WILL have their requests honored, but with LHArc flavored
     files.  If this means my system will no longer be listed as
     1/1, so be it.  There's nothing special about having a 1/
     listing; it's actually a pain in the butt, done only because
     someone I respect greatly asked.

     There probably will be other ramifications to my actions.  I
     suspect that one or two of you will file complaints, although
     I can't imagine on what grounds.  There will undoubtedly be a
     number of articles in forthcoming issues, and increased volume
     in one or more echoes, some of which will probably resort to
     the tried and true ad-hominem attack on the messenger.  I'll
     gladly stipulate for the record that I'm a card carrying net
     @hole; statements from others on this point are therefore a
     waste of bandwidth.

     Any other speculation would just get me accused of thinking
     like a scumbag - er - lawyer; I'll pass on that, thanks!

     I hope that a thorough, careful discussion of these issues will
     take place at the upcoming FidoCon.  I hope it won't degenerate
     into some sort of an alley gang fight.  It was Thom himself who
     said FidoNet was a technical statement; rather than wasting
     more time and effort on killing or reviving IFNA, perhaps the
     gathering could get back to what it's all about: an amateur
     electronic mail network, and not an organizational debating
     society.

     Have a good FidoCon.

     Oh, and Pablo - I had a little something, direct and indirect,
     to do with that document.  If you're going to give everyone and
     their brother credit, then at least get it right.

     Well, the date for FidoCon is finally upon us.  Suffice to say
     it WASN'T easy putting together an international sysop
     convention that was also hosting conventions for four amateur
     electronic networks!

     Some final words on the convention:

     If anyone is interested, there's a company in NY, PC Computing
     Rentals, 1-800-765-4727 that can arrange for PC rentals during
     the convention to be delivered to the hotel. One attendee is
     getting a PS/2, 40Meg, 1.44 Floppy, with serial/parallel ports
     for $149 for the full 5 days.  Not bad at all.

     Butch Walker will be making a brief appearance to talk about
     Electronic Support Groups on Thursday.

     Here is the conference schedule of events as they stand today:

      10  Farewell / Conference Concludes

     For those who've helped out, I want to extend my personal
     thanks.  It's been a lot of work, but I think it'll all be worth
     it once the conference is underway.

     FidoCon 1991 - The New Beginning
     Zone 1 Region Coordinators
     Zone 1 Zone Coordinator

     Let's  not forget or  minimize  the  great  deal  of  effort  and
     dedication  by  the  members of the FidoCon  1990  Committee.  We
     thank  the 1990 Committee  for sponsoring FidoCon 1990  and  look
     forward to a successful  FidoCon this  week.  Some of us will  be
     there enjoying the Conference  while the rest  offer  our regrets
     and best wishes to the Committee and all of Zone 1.

     Several weeks  ago we  issued a call for proposals for the Zone 1
     FidoCon in 1991. While our in baskets did not overflow with bids,
     we did  receive two  before the  announced July 18 deadline. They
     were submitted  by Thom Henderson (the Henderson proposal) and by
     a trio  of Net  104 SysOps (the Boulder proposal). Interestingly,
     the two proposals (reprinted in full following this introduction)
     provided us  with an  opportunity to  vote  for  two  contrasting
     styles. One  was a  traditional FidoCon  proposal;  the  other  a
     refreshing alternative approach.

     We have  completed the  selection  process  and  are  pleased  to
     announce that  Zone 1  FidoCon 1991  will be  hosted in  Boulder,
     Colorado.  The   backup   will   be   the   Henderson   Proposal.
     Congratulations folks. You and all of FidoNet are Winners!

     The outcome was 9 in favor of the Boulder Proposal and 1 in favor
     of the  Henderson Proposal.  The vote  by each Region Coordinator
     was:

                          10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19

          Boulder          Y   Y   Y       Y   Y   Y   Y   Y   Y
          Henderson                    Y

     Here is  the full  text  of  each  proposal  (edited  to  satisfy
     Artspec):

     "The Henderson Proposal"
     ------------------------

     I have  a serious  proposal for  FidoCon '91.  I'm sure I can get
     some net or group to be the "official hosts", or maybe I could do
     it myself (it would be simplicity in itself).

     There has  almost always been some flak about the conference, and
     it's rising  to new  heights (dropping  to new depths?) of idiocy
     this year,  so I  have an  idea on  how to keep it from happening
     again, just maybe.

     Simply put,  we just  pick a hotel and pick a weekend. That's it.
     Everybody makes  their own arrangements for rooms, travel, meals,
     entertainment, et cetera. There would be no conference fees since
     there  would   be  no   conference  costs.   There  would  be  no
     registration requirements  since there  would be no fees. And, of
     course, no seed money or contract guarantees would be required.
     FIDONEWS 7-31                Page 7                   30 Jul 1990


     All that is required is:

     a) Some  sort of  "official blessing" on the whole deal making it
     the official FidoCon,

     2) Somebody to write an occasional article about it for FidoNews,
     and

     iii) Somebody  to put an entry for it in the FidoNews calendar of
     events.

     Dear RC,

        Stop!   Wait!  Hold the Presses!  Look to your  "Snail  Mail"
     address for information that is already on its way.

        Much  as we despise waiting for the last several  nanoseconds
     to get things done, when one is dealing with government agencies
     one  gets to wait for them.  We told them over a month ago  that
     the  convention  bid  HAD to be in YOUR hands  by  the  18th  of
     July... you can, of course, guess when everything arrived.


        Oh, yes, please allow us to introduce ourselves...

        We are (in node number order) Terry Travis (104/69), Marshall
     Barry (104/169), and Michelle Weisblat (104/969), and we are the
     core  committee for the FidoCon '91 in Boulder,  Colorado,  bid.
     As  a group, we have more than fifteen (15) years experience  in
     organizing, planning, running and working conventions.

        Having been deeply involved with conventions and  conferences
     in the past, we are fully aware of the time and energy  required
     to  "make  it  happen".  Our  experience  includes   CopperCons,
     WesterCons and WorldCons (Science Fiction Conventions),  ranging
     in  size  from 50 to over 6,000 attending.  Each of us  has,  in
     addition,  successfully  run our own business -  allowing  us  a
     complete  and detailed understanding of the legal and  financial
     requirements  implicit  in  any  undertaking  of  the  size  and
     complexity of a professional convention.

        As  a committee, we have the full support and cooperation  of
     the  Colorado  and  Boulder  Tourism  Boards  as  well  as   the
     invaluable  assistance  of  the Colorado  TravelBank.   We  have
     negotiated special rates, both on rooms and facilities, with our
     planned convention hotel, the Clarion Harvest House in  Boulder,
     Colorado.  In  addition, we have arranged  with  a  professional
     FIDONEWS 7-31                Page 8                   30 Jul 1990


     travel   agent  to  provide  all  travel-related  services   for
     convention members and their families.

        Of  course, we feel we can offer the best overall  attendance
     rates ever for FidoCon members, significant others and  families
     wishing to take a vacation in the magnificent Colorado  mountain
     summer.

        With  our background and knowledge we can assure you  that  A
     "Boulder" New Beginning will be not just a success, but the best
     FidoCon ever!

        So, please read on for details and plans...


                             DETAILS, DETAILS

        Fido's  first  convention was held in Colorado  Springs  just
     five  short  years  ago.  It was a beginning ...  Many  are  now
     asking  for a New Beginning, a re-birth.  Boulder, Colorado,  is
     the place.

                                We Propose
         FidoCon '91 - A "Boulder" New Beginning - Aug 8-11, 1991


                           HOTEL AND FACILITIES

                                  Rooms

        We  have  negotiated an extremely attractive  rate  with  the
     Clarion Harvest House Hotel near downtown Boulder.  As a  member
     of  the  convention, ALL rooms (with the obvious  exceptions  of
     suites) will be available for $82.50 per night (Tax  Included!),
     Single AND Double Occupancy.  Children 12 and under, in the same
     room, are free.

        Rooms  can  be requested with one King, or two  Double  beds.
     ALL  rooms, of course, have remote control color TV  and  direct
     dial telephones (with modular plugs).


        Both  NON-SMOKING  and HANDICAPPED Rooms are  available  upon
     request.

        Hospitality suites will, similarly, be discounted, and  range
     from  "Junior"  suites  ($175.00  plus  tax/per  night)  to  the
     "Presidential" suite ($300.00 plus tax/per night).

        Function Suites, for dealers, distributors, manufacturers and
     displays,  are available for $150.00 (plus tax) per day.   These
     are specially located rooms with convenient elevator access.

     FIDONEWS 7-31                Page 9                   30 Jul 1990


        For those with a taste for pure luxury, the Harvest House has
     agreed to discount their VIP TOWER rooms to the convention.  All
     VIP  rooms  include  (in addition to the  "basic"  amenities)  a
     better view, a complimentary continental breakfast and  cocktail
     hour  (with  hors d'oevres), access to the  Executive  Travelers
     Club,  "turndown"  service and  additional  "inroom"  amenities,
     bathrobes, and newspapers.  As we all know "there ain't no  such
     thing  as  a  free  lunch",  the  VIP  rooms  are  available  at
     $95.00/$115.00 (per night, plus tax) single/double.


        The  BoulderCon '91 Committee will be working  directly  with
     the hotel to assure that all reservations are properly made  and
     notated, and will be responsible for assignment of all Suites.


        Oh,  by the way, for those wishing to vacation,  the  SPECIAL
     RATES are AVAILABLE for those ARRIVING EARLY and STAYING LATE!



                              Meeting Space

        The Clarion has ample meeting space (over 9000 square  feet),
     as well as seating for over 450 in the Grand Ballroom.  At  this
     time,   ALL  available  function  space  is  dedicated  to   the
     convention.  In this way, FidoCon is assured of sufficient space
     for all activities and events.



                             Hotel Facilities

        The Clarion is situated in a 16 acre, park-like setting.

        Facilities   include  (this  is  the   "Condensed"   version)
     Indoor/Outdoor  Tennis, Playground (for children),  Biking  (and
     Bike  Rental),  the ONLY free-flowing, cold water,  urban  trout
     stream  observatory  in the United  States,  Botanical  Gardens,
     Basketball, Volleyball, Boulder Creek, Outdoor Pool and Hot Tub,
     Exercise Room, and an Indoor Pool (and hot tub, of course!).

        All this WITHOUT having to even leave the hotel!



                     Dining (In and Around the Hotel)

        Unlike  the  1990  convention, we propose  NO  MEAL  TICKETS.
     Being somewhat snobbish, we prefer to be able to choose our REAL
     food  from  the  over  91 choices within a  short  walk  of  the
     Clarion.
     FIDONEWS 7-31                Page 10                  30 Jul 1990


        For  those who prefer to dine out, we are in the  process  of
     negotiating  meal discounts with a number of the restaurants  in
     the area.

        For  those who prefer not to have to leave the premises,  the
     Clarion offers excellent food at reasonable to moderate  prices.
     In addition, Champs Lounge is one of Boulder's more  interesting
     and friendly night spots.


                                 Banquet

        The  Banquet  will be held on Saturday night  and  will  cost
     $25.00 per person.  In staying with Colorado's "western"  theme,
     we  will  be providing a "Hoe-Down Bar-B-Que"  Banquet,  a  meal
     which is sure to please most everyone's taste buds.

        Included  in  the meal will be Bar-B-Que  Chicken,  Ribs  and
     Beef, baked beans, salad, muffins, beverage and more!



                              TRANSPORTATION

                                 Airlines

        United  and Continental Airlines are both bidding to  be  the
     "Official  FidoCon  Airline".  As each uses Denver  as  a  "hub"
     city, they have regular, excellent, service.  Both have  offered
     five (5) percent off their lowest fares, and forty (40)  percent
     off coach fares as an incentive.  A First Class discount will be
     negotiated upon acceptance of the bid.

        Since Denver is an International Airport, direct flights  are
     available from many of the world's major cities.

        As  to  actual fares, much as Boulder is considered to  be  a
     "New Age Mecca", not one prognosticator was willing to commit to
     giving   anything  more  than  "SWAG"s  (Scientific,   Wild-A**,
     Guesses).

        Some Samples are (all "round trip", FULL COACH):

          Los Angeles/Denver                 $320
          Newark/Denver                      $380
          Chicago/Denver                     $300
          Atlanta/Denver                     $300

          Australia/Denver                  $1250
          Tel Aviv/Denver                   $1450

     FIDONEWS 7-31                Page 11                  30 Jul 1990


        Our  travel agent ASSURES us that provisions can be made  for
     group  flights - especially if 10 or more are willing to  travel
     together; 20 or more from "out of the US".


                           From/To The Airport

        Transportation  from/to the Denver Airport is available  from
     6:30  AM through 10:00PM every day via "The Airporter"  service.
     Cost  is about $8.50 per person each way.  Special  arrangements
     can  be made for those who know, IN ADVANCE, that they  will  be
     arriving outside the above hours.

        Rental  cars  are available both at the airport  and  at  the
     Clarion (Budget Rent-a-Car).  Should you care to drive from  the
     airport, Boulder is an easy 40 minute, 4-lane highway trip.


                                 Driving

        Driving  to Boulder in August can be a scenic trip from  most
     anywhere  in the United States.  Two major  Interstate  Highways
     (I-25  and  I-70)  provide  easy access  to  the  high  country.
     Boulder, and the hotel, are at the Northwest end of US-36, which
     connects directly to I-25.



                                 BOULDER

                               Why Boulder?

        Boulder  is  a university community of  approximately  90,000
     situated  at the foot of the Rocky Mountains.  More  than  that,
     Boulder is growing, with many high-technology and communications
     corporations already here and others moving into the area.

        While  many think only of the excellent powder skiing  during
     the  Colorado winter, the summertime is spectacularly  beautiful
     as  well.   With  LOW humidity and  an  average  August  daytime
     temperature  of  75-80 degrees, one feels like  getting  up  and
     DOING  things.   Night temperatures average between  60  and  65
     degrees, making that relaxing evening "hot tub" a special event.

        Within  a  short distance of the Clarion, one can  find  most
     anything  from  bookshops to boutiques,  movies  to  nightclubs,
     Siamese  to  Sushi, and Jazz to Heavy Metal.   Slightly  further
     away,  one  can walk the Boulder Mall, an  open-air  mall  which
     stretches  almost  a mile and features some of the  town's  more
     (in)famous bars, shops and people.

                             Seeing Colorado

        To  help you enjoy the splendor of Boulder, and Colorado,  we
     are planning on offering AT LEAST the following activities...


        If  you can say "Boulder Big Three Brewery Bash" three  times
     fast, then you're up to the Big Three Brewery Tour.  We'll visit
     the Busch, Coors and Boulder Breweries (that's not easy to  say,
     either!)  in  a  grand, eight-hour  trip.   Of  course,  there's
     tasting at the end of each stop - so we're willing to wager that
     no one walks afterwards.

        The  tour  will be limited to about thirty people.   Cost  is
     estimated  at $30.00 (adults only, please!), which includes  the
     trip, the bus, and LUNCH!


        Want to Flash Back FROM the Future (about a hundred years) to
     a  time when things were simpler, and there was not only  little
     pollution  but  NO computers?  Come take the Horseback  Tour  of
     Boulder County...  Or just go out for a little of that "western"
     clean air...

        In  any event, this is open to adults and children  alike  --
     most  especially the computer widows and widowers!  Cost  to  be
     determined by the number interested.


        Psychic  Tours of Colorado and all points north, south,  east
     and west will be available at NO extra charge for those  capable
     and  so  inclined.  Visit the Great Pyramid  of  Egypt,  Lenin's
     Tomb,  or even the Dark Side of the Moon (sorry, no sound  track
     available) right from the comfort of your own room!
        One of Boulder's finest "New Age" Astral Projectionists  will
     be available to assist and conduct the tour.


        Like  to hike?  Like tall trees and even taller  tales?   Day
     trips into the Rocky Mountain National Park, Estes Park, and the
     nearby Boulder Hills are all easily arranged.



        If  you  would like to be involved in any  of  these  special
     activities,  or  have  requests  for  activities/events  before,
     during or after FidoCon, we're willing to help out.

                           Planned Programming

        Having  polled several people who have attended all  previous
     FidoCons,  and  received both a great deal  of  information  AND
     support,  we  have decided to run two "tracks"  of  programming.
     One  track  will be technical and products oriented;  the  other
     will be more general and politics oriented.

        We plan to have the following individuals or companies  doing
     presentations:

        AST,  ALR,  DELL, USR, HAYES, SEA,  eSOFT,  Western  Digital,
     MiniScribe/MaxStor, Seagate, AT&T, MCI, and Sprint.

        Alan Applegate, Bob Hartman, Vince Pierello, Phil Becker, Ben
     Baker, and Tom Henderson.


        Panel topics proposed include:

        "Dealing  with  SysOp Burnout", "For this I gave up  my  Love
     Life?", "EchoMail vs. Astral Projection: Is there a  Conflict?",
     "Policy  Violations: How to Tell, How to React", "Users?   Do  I
     really  need  them?", and "Policy? We don't  need  no  steenkin'
     Policy..."


                                 Banquet

        We  feel  that  the  annual banquet  should  be  an  "awards"
     banquet,  with  plaques being presented to  the  *C's,  Backbone
     systems, Gateways and other people that make FidoNet work.  This
     year,  we would also like to "roast" Tom Jennings  for  creating
     the monster, although there are other [potential] roastees.

        We  plan on sending out "NetMail" Ballots to  all  registered
     members,  as  well  as  the *C's, to help  us  make  the  awards
     meaningful and fun.


                                   Fun

        Speaking of fun, as you may have noticed by now we don't plan
     on  taking everything as deadly serious.  Certainly  there  have
     been  too many things taken too solemnly.  It is  our  intention
     that  EVERY  member  of  FidoCon  '91  leave  with  a  smile  on
     his/her(/its?) face.


                             Other Activities

     FIDONEWS 7-31                Page 14                  30 Jul 1990


        We  have  arranged for a "Vendor's" room to be  available  on
     Saturday and Sunday.  This room will allow many of the  Hardware
     and   Software  Suppliers  to  demonstrate  their   wares   and,
     optionally, either make or arrange for sales.  In addition, this
     allows the vendors to be available to answer questions,  discuss
     problems,  and  even make special prices  available  to  FidoCon
     members.


        In-house Mail will be available to FidoCon members.  We  plan
     on  having an on-site network linking the convention  operations
     and hospitality suites, as well as making NetMail available  via
     the  "traditional"  FidoCon yearly  address.   Messages  to/from
     convention  members  will be available through a  local  network
     accessible  from  many locations.  In this way, the  messy  (and
     often  unusable) physical bulletin boards will be a  "thing"  of
     the past.


        Baby/Child   Sitting  services  will  be   available   during
     convention hours; evenings by advance request.  In order to make
     FidoCon  a more pleasant activity for those with children,  this
     service  will be provided FREE of charge on a  SPACE  AVAILABLE,
     basis.   Those  who  wish to use  this  invaluable  service  are
     requested  to  make  their  needs known as  far  in  advance  as
     possible.
          Please  note:  while the service is  FREE,  diapers,  food,
     medicines,  and  other  child "accessories"  are  NOT  supplied.
     Please make sure all children come with all required  amenities.
     Also, a signed waiver (available at FidoCon) will be  mandatory,
     if just to protect everyone involved.



                           Raffles/Door Prizes

        Yes, Virginia, we will be giving away all sorts of things.

        We  CURRENTLY  have  a  commitment from  eSOFT  to  donate  a
     COMPLETE 16-line TBBS/TIMS/TDBS Software Package.

        Other  vendors  are willing to commit to  donating  hardware,
     software, modems, and supplies.  In fact, it's entirely possible
     we'll  be able to put together another "dream" system, and  THEN
     some!

        For the SysOp with "everything", we are also putting together
     a "nightmare" system - the worst of everything... not acceptable
     for  use  as  a  boat  anchor  as  it  will  be  sure  to   sink
     intermittently!

     FIDONEWS 7-31                Page 15                  30 Jul 1990


                                  Users

        We  are evaluating opening the sessions and banquet to,  ugh,
     users.   Much  of what happens in and  around  FidoNet  directly
     affects how users react and interact.  Perhaps if they knew what
     factors were really in play, there wouldn't be as large a gap.
        Of   course,  Fido  SysOps  would  ALWAYS  get   preferential
     treatment - we wouldn't think of doing anything less!


                                  Video

        As  part  of  the overall theme  of  communications,  we  are
     planning  to video-tape all major sessions, and as many  of  the
     other activities as possible.  Edited (not censored) copies will
     be made available at our costs plus the ubiquitous "shipping and
     handling".  Everyone should have a copy!


                            Other Information

        eSOFT  and Bit Bucket Software have ALREADY committed to  our
     bid and to purchasing Hospitality suites.

        BoulderCon  '91  will  be  incorporated  as  a  "for   profit
     corporation"  in the State of Colorado shortly after the bid  is
     accepted.

        Progress Reports will be mailed (US Snail) to all  registered
     convention  members and all Regional and Zone  Coordinators.   A
     program book, commemorating a New Beginning, will be provided to
     all  registered  members, and will be mailed to  those  who  are
     unable to physically attend.

        It  is intended that a significant contribution  towards  the
     Net104  Echomail  fund  will be made from the  net  proceeds  of
     BoulderCon '91.


                     CONVENTION MEMBERSHIP AND RATES

        No, we didn't forget... we just wanted to leave the best  for
     last.


     Basic Membership:

          Announcement to March 31, 1991:                   $ 69.00
          April 1 to July 15, 1991:                         $104.00
          After July 15 and At the Door:                    $169.00

     FIDONEWS 7-31                Page 16                  30 Jul 1990


     Spouse/Significant Other (at all times):               $  9.69

     Minors - With PAYING Parent(s) or Guardian(s):         $ FREE!

     FidoCon '91
          A "Boulder" New Beginning T-Shirts (All Sizes):   $ 10.00


        You ask, where did we get these rates?

        We're Net104, nodes 69, 169, and 969.
        (Ask a silly question, get a silly answer.)

        We  HAVE done the calculations necessary to assure  ourselves
     that the rates are sufficient to "break even" under all but  the
     worst  conditions  (e.g.  a  major  recession,  fewer  than  120
     members, etc.).


     We  STRONGLY encourage SysOps to buy their memberships BEFORE  July
     15, 1991.  Any memberships RECEIVED after July 15th, 1991,  will
     NOT be pre-processed and will be considered to be "at the  door"
     memberships.  Besides, it saves you $65.00.

     The  Spouse/Significant  Other  rate is  designed  to  encourage
     FidoCon members to make Boulder a "family" event... the  minimal
     fee helps defray our cost of badges, supplies, etc.



                          CONVENTION HOSPITALITY

        In  the spirit of other, non-Fido, conventions, we intend  to
     keep  the convention hospitality suite open on a nearly 24  hour
     basis.   We feel that those of us who are "night" people need  a
     place to meet and talk just as much as the "day" folk.

        Finally,  the  convention  Hospitality  Suite  will   provide
     "munchies" and "soft" beverages to all convention members.

     FidoNet Mailer Compatibility - Test Results
     by Philip L. Becker
     President - eSoft, Inc.
     1:104/23

     eSoft, Inc. has recently completed and released The Integrated
     Mail System (TIMS) which is a multiline mailer expansion module
     for TBBS allowing up to 32 simultaneous FidoNet mail sessions on
     a single CPU using only DOS.  The first step taken at the outset
     of this project was to determine what was required to be truly
     FidoNet compatible.

     I originally thought that this would primarily consist of
     obtaining the FidoNet Standards documents and doing some minor
     testing to resolve any ambiguities of my interpretation of them.
     I quickly realized, however, that the mailers in use in FidoNet
     took great liberties with the FTS-0001 specification, and that if
     I was to produce a truly compatible mailer, significant testing
     would be required to determine what really was being done in
     practice in FidoNet.

     As a result, eSoft commissioned the largest technical study ever
     undertaken to determine compatibility and operation of FidoNet
     mailer programs.  A goal of this study was to develop improved
     standards documents which were both more accurate and more easily
     used to generate code than previous standards documents.  This
     effort was mandatory for eSoft to produce a mailer product to its
     high standards of reliability and compatibility, since there was
     no "off the shelf" way to determine true FidoNet compatibility.

     I had no idea when I began of the politics that would be
     involved, and the cost in both time and money which eSoft, Inc.
     would incur just to define "FidoNet Compatibility".  However,
     eSoft has allowed me to donate the resulting documents (FTS-0007
     and FTS-0008) to the FidoNet for use by any mailer authors free
     of charge so that others may be spared this cost.  I would like
     to again thank all of those who worked behind the scenes to help
     me obtain the required information to develop this document.  I
     also would like to thank the FidoNet Technical Standards
     Committee for their work in helping me organize and present these
     documents in a form which could be adopted as standards.

     FTS-0007 and FTS-0008 are documents which describe enhancements
     to the basic FidoNet FTS-0001 protocol.  If they are implemented,
     the resulting mailer will be compatible with any FTS-0001 mailer,
     and also with all correctly implemented extensions to that
     protocol which are in use in the network today.

     Over the past year or so, the natural outcome of having loosely
     defined standards, no test suites, and no enforcement mechanism
     has begun to occur.  Users of various mailer programs have
     complained that they have compatibility problems with other
     mailer programs, and no one knows for sure what is real and what
     is just operator error.  Even when definite compatibility
     problems are documented, no one knows which software is "at
     fault" and often the authors of these programs find they are in a
     FIDONEWS 7-31                Page 18                  30 Jul 1990


     bind, with no clear guidelines to follow for what is right.  The
     result is that as more and more mailer programs come on the
     scene, compatibility suffers and user frustration grows.

     In the process of developing these documents as well as coding
     TIMS itself, eSoft also commissioned the largest engineering test
     of FidoNet mailer software ever done.  It is some of the results
     of this testing which I want to present in this article.

     As the following test results will show, most of the mailer
     software in use today doesn't properly support FTS-0001 mail
     sessions.  In addition the various "extended" FTS-0001 sessions
     (all generally good ideas) often have implementation errors which
     render them incompatible.  These test results are not an attempt
     to indicate which mailer programs are "better" or "worse" than
     others.  Instead, these results are presented to let users of
     these programs know where the problem may lie if they are
     experiencing compatibility problems, and also to let the various
     authors of these programs know of any problems they need to fix
     in order to be in compliance with FidoNet Standards.

     It is a FidoNet policy that any mailer used in FidoNet must
     implement FTS-0001 mail sessions.  These test results show that
     some do not meet that minimum standard.  In fact (not counting
     TIMS here of course), only SEAdog 4.1 and 4.51 have no errors in
     implementation of the FTS-0001 standard.

     Test results on the session protocol (mail pickup, file requests
     etc.) are also given.  Many of the incompatibilities arise at
     this level and show themselves as failures during file requests
     and mail pickup.  Since TIMS is the first major mailer to
     implement only the "DietIFNA" mode of the FTS-0006 standard,
     results on compatibility at that level (the minimum required
     level of FTS-0006) are also presented. The mailer programs are
     listed alphabetically with a brief summary:

     BinkleyTerm 2.30
     ----------------
     BinkleyTerm 2.30 will not resend the EOT on a file when doing
     SEAlink Overdrive if the EOT is NAK'd leading to a "deadly
     embrace" condition.

     BinkleyTerm 2.30 has a very odd SEAlink startup sequence as both
     the receiving system, and the sending system.  This makes startup
     very erratic under some conditions.

     BinkleyTerm 2.30 will start sending data and streaming it right
     from the first NAK during a SEAlink session (FTS-0007 says to
     wait for the first ACK, or to parse the entire SEAlink NAK before
     doing that).

     FIDONEWS 7-31                Page 19                  30 Jul 1990


     BinkleyTerm 2.30 does not send packet files with .PKT extensions
     in FTS-0006/DietIFNA mode.

     D'Bridge
     --------
     D'Bridge will start sending data and streaming it right from the
     first NAK during a SEAlink session (FTS-0007 says to wait for the
     first ACK, or to parse the entire SEAlink NAK before doing that).

     D'bridge cannot have the final EOT (that ends the batch sending
     of files) ACK'd (optional in FTS-0001), or it will not pick up
     mail.  It also incorrectly sends SUB characters following the
     final EOT which must be ignored.  Only if TSYNC is sent instead
     of the EOT at this time will the line "turn around" allowing
     pickup and requests to occur.

     D'Bridge does not send .REQ files during FTS-0006/DietIFNA
     sessions making file requests impossible in this mode unless the
     user explicitly sends a message with a properly formed .REQ file
     attached to it.

     D'Bridge starts sending data without waiting for the beginning
     NAK during an FTS-0006/DietIFNA session.

     Fido 12s
     --------
     Fido 12s does not send the filename in the TeLink header block
     during FTS-0006/DietIFNA sessions.


     Frontdoor 1.99
     --------------
     Frontdoor 1.99 and 1.99a cannot have the final EOT (that ends the
     batch sending of files) ACK'd (optional in FTS-0001), or it will
     not pick up mail.  It also incorrectly sends SUB characters
     following the final EOT which must be ignored.  Only if TSYNC is
     sent instead of the EOT at this time will the line "turn around"
     allowing pickup and requests to occur.

     Frontdoor 1.99 and 1.99a send the first block of a file with the
     TeLink (SYN character) header, and sends it checksum regardless
     of the Xmodem poll character used.  This makes these versions of
     Frontdoor non-FTS-0001 compatible (and not XMODEM either).

     Frontdoor 1.99c attempts to do SEAlink on the receiving side, but
     apparently can never recover from an error (this is not
     confirmed, we just never saw it recover during testing).

     Frontdoor pads the last block of Xmodem transfers with NUL (0x00)
     characters instead of ^Z's.

     FIDONEWS 7-31                Page 20                  30 Jul 1990


     Frontdoor will start sending data and streaming it right from the
     first NAK during a SEAlink session (FTS-0007 specifically says to
     wait for the first ACK, or to parse the entire SEAlink NAK before
     doing that).


     Seadog 4.51b
     ------------
     SEAdog 4.51b will not accept a TeLink header block.  This is
     allowed under FTS-0001, but causes files to lose the exact file
     length and timestamp when sent from an FTS-0001 compliant mailer.


     Summary
     -------
     No one should take this presentation of the technical facts found
     by testing to be an attack on any of the above programs.  They
     are all the result of best efforts by their respective authors in
     an environment which begged for such an outcome.

     Few have the money or time to put into the type of study which
     produced these results.  This was a very expensive development
     effort.  Frankly, many who may have that money or time would
     decide that it is best spent elsewhere!

     I have made these test results available to all of the various
     software authors and I hope that they can use them to remedy the
     current compatibility problems (several have privately assured me
     that this is in progress for their programs, and some updated
     versions with these problems corrected have already been seen in
     beta testing or released).

     More important than the immediate problems, however, is the need
     to either have better testing of FidoNet compatibility, or for
     the user community to realize that this situation will arise
     again if conditions remain the same.  True commercial use of this
     technology will be impossible if it remains ill-defined.
     Commercial use will trend towards "dialects" of FidoNet which are
     controlled by a single company.  In such a setting compatibility
     is not an issue.  This is not the most desirable outcome for
     either the Commercial world or the Amateur FidoNet.


     Postscript
     ----------
     Detailed testing methods for showing the errors listed here along
     with several others (as well as detailed error analysis) will be
     made available for file request sometime after FidoCon.  I would
     also like to publicly thank Ray Gwynn for his help in providing
     some of the testing tools and methods without which this project
     could not have been completed.

                        New Medical Echo

     A new medical echo has been started and currently is being
     passed between eight medical related BBS's.  The TAG for this
     echo is MED_RAYS, and has been developed to enable persons
     working in the Radiology Areas (i.e. X-Ray, Ultrasound, Nuclear
     Medicine and Radiation Therapy) to pass information related to
     new procedures/techniques, medicolegal ethics, etc.  Radiology
     students, professionals, physicians, residents and medical
     students are encouraged to participate.

     Besides offering a means for professionals to exchange ideas
     and new techniques, persons with questions specific to this
     area are also encouraged to participate.  Misinformation
     regarding diagnostic radiation exposure to both X-Radiation
     and Sound Radiation (yes they are both waves, although they
     differ in characteristics) has occurred and will re-occur
     within the electronic media.  The MED_RAYS echo will be an
     alternative source for persons concerned with exposures to
     various diagnostic modalities to gain additional information.

     This message area is available via the following nodes:

     * Progressive News newsletter

     Progressive News newsletter hits the stands

     This is just a short note to announce that a new newsletter has
     been started called "Progressive News."

     The newsletter contains various articles about current events
     and news tidbits, along with editorials and letters.  The
     articles are quite informative and about topics which no other
     online newsletter seems to cover.

     The first issue of Progressive News has now been released as
     PROG0101.ARC and it should be available shortly through the SDS
     newsletter file-echo or you can WaZoo file-request it directly
     as PROG0101.ARC (49k) from 1:141/552 during all hours except
     zone 1 mail hour.

     Since the newsletter is new and just created we would appreciate
     anyone distributing it to your friends or letting others know
     about it.

     If you'd like to write an article for Progressive News, article
     specification documentation is available inside of PROG0101.ARC
     or file-requestable as PROGSPEC.TXT also from 1:141/552.

     I'm sure you'll find Progressive News informative and I hope
     you'll become a regular reader.

                 Report from Region 1:17 FidoNet Convention
               Held at Menucha Retreat and Conference Center
                             July 27-29, 1990

     [ Editor's note: This is a cumulative account from a number of
     attendees who worked together to type this sucker up in time for
     our publication deadline.  The computer they typed it on was in a
     damned hot room.  Enjoy the fruits of their labors. ]

     Contrary to rumors previously published in these pages, the
     Columbia River Gorge near Portland, Oregon was neither cloudy nor
     windy for the FidoNet Region-1:17 Conference held this past
     weekend.  Menucha was, in short, a beautiful location for our
     gathering of 26 regional delegates (11 visiting region 17 sysops
     and 15 from Net 105).  In addition, we were joined by seven
     significant others and were glad to welcome five special guests
     from outside the region -- Doug Boone, Bob Hartman, Tom Jennings,
     Vince Perriello and Tim Pozar.  Greg Lang from Intel PCEO was
     also able to join us for the product discussions on Saturday.

     We were welcomed by the gracious Net-1:105 conference organizers
     who went out of their way to make our arrival pleasant and easy.
     Hats off to Ken Zwaschka and Janet Murray who did a wonderful job
     of organizing this event.

     After our first meal, the participants gathered outside for an
     informal discussion about the weekend's lodging.  The Menucha
     director, Merritt McCall, gave a history of the Menucha property
     - which dates back to the 1800's - which is now owned and
     operated by the 1st Presbyterian Church.  Before being sold to
     the church, Menucha was owned by the family of Julius Meier (a
     prominent businessman and governor).   Lastly Mr. McCall reminded
     us of the rules at Menucha including a warning against the use or
     possession of Stealth Cookies.  How foolish, we left them in
     California.

     After Mr. McCall expressed an interest in FidoNet, it was decided
     that a general overview of FidoNet was in order.  After some
     prodding, we persuaded Tom Jennings to tell the "FidoNet story."
     Not long after TJ began, a plague of mosquitoes (perhaps
     illustrating some of the points being made) prompted us to move
     to the indoor meeting area, a cathedral ceilinged/open beamed
     room with a stone fireplace.  There Tom and others finished what
     they could remember of the tale.  The usual discussion and
     debate on the history and merits of various aspects of FidoNet
     continued in large and small groups until the wee hours.

     Discussion on Saturday centered on various products, in more or
     less alphabetical order.  Vince & Bob talked informally about
     Binkley 2.40 and the two binary bug fix patches; they indicated
     that corrected source code would be available immediately after
     their return from New Jersey (if they survive).  Tony Wagner
     talked about D'Bridge and the new EMSI handshake, which started a
     lively debate about AKAs and passwords.  Tom Jennings said a few
     words about Fido, including Version 12s+ which has been
     distributed on SDS.
     FIDONEWS 7-31                Page 25                  30 Jul 1990


     That was followed by the two semi-formal presentations.  The
     first was Greg Lang from Intel PCEO, who talked about the high
     speed modem marketplace and standards, the expected future of
     high speed modem use and sales, and a little bit about Intel's
     modem product line.  "Baud to the Bone" T-shirts were presented
     to everyone.  The door prize drawing awarded 2400 MNP modems to
     Ken Zwaschka and Janet Murray and a "mystery future product"
     prize to Lloyd Miller.  The booby prize (SEAdog 3.8 and a 4.1
     upgrade) was awarded to Tim Pozar ...  this turned out to be
     fortuitous, as it had to be pressed into service later when we
     realized that there were no floppy disks available for the diskie
     toss.

     Janet Murray showed "High-Tech Tools", a videotape of various
     resources available for elementary and high school students
     engaged in library research projects.  The videotape was produced
     by Portland Public Schools and included segments on the videodisc
     version of Reader's Guide, online information utilities, and a
     student using a local FidoNet BBS to get an answer to a Pascal
     programming question.

     Doug Boone summarized the current status of Opus 1.1 and some of
     the Opus utilities.  Bob Hartman said a few words about TIMS (the
     Integrated Mail System for TBBS), which allows up to 32 lines of
     inbound mail on a single PC (but can not make outbound calls), and
     Tim Pozar talked about UFGATE.  The release of the new uucico
     module (gnuuio) has been delayed because it is designed to work
     with new versions of mailin/mailout and newsin/newsout that are
     not ready yet.  Tim is going to add a -o (old) switch to gnuuio
     so that it can be used with the current versions.

     After the product discussions (and author abuse) we retired to
     the pool for the Curmudgeon Toss event.  Curmudgeon clones were
     in good supply, although a certain software author ran away and
     hid in the forest and the former REC-1:17 stayed safely out of
     reach.  Competition was fierce, with distance advantages gained
     by astute Curmudgeon selections; however it was determined after
     the event that the team of Tim Pozar, Tom Jennings, Mike Botkin
     and Bob Hartman had won by virtue of bonus points awarded for
     Birkenstocks and Levis.

     After dinner, everyone gathered on the lawn for the traditional
     Diskie Toss event.  Competition was lively, with just about
     everyone participating.  No one actually managed to successfully
     install the SEAdog disks IN the garbage can, but Dawn Ganshirt
     came the closest.  Kit Thomas was second.  So the top diskie
     throwers (SEAdog installers?) in Region 1:17 are an eleven year
     old and a blind man.

     While the silly folk made an attempt at serious discussion, the
     true believers had discovered two Aerobies.  With their combined
     talents, it didn't take them very long to get one stuck in a
     tree.  In typical FidoNet fashion, we sent someone out on a limb,
     and then proceeded to tell him what to do.  Somehow this resulted
     in retrieval of the little bugger.  A few minutes later they
     stuck the other Aerobie in a much taller tree.  Thus the Aerobie
     FIDONEWS 7-31                Page 26                  30 Jul 1990


     toss quickly transformed to a tree climbing, stick throwing, and
     rope with hammer toss, as they valiantly tried to rescue the
     Aerobie in distress.  The winner of the event was a large, quite
     beautiful vine maple.

     As usual the evening moved to small and large discussions ranging
     from how to run a Framistat-48 with your Flogistron-90 to what
     might happen next weekend at NJ's Necrophilia-90, where IFNA rises
     from the dead to get you.

     Sunday morning, after porridge and strawberry crepes, there was
     general discussion of FidoNet political dynamics, flaming,
     democracy, and hypocrisy.  The best suggestion was that FidoNet
     be shut down completely for one week every year so folk have a
     moment's pause to realize that there's a real world out there.
     There was a short review of what those organizing R-1:17 FidoCon
     '91 might want to do (of course we neglected to write it down),
     confirmation that the Victoria or Vancouver folk should host it,
     and an agreement that any leftover funds from R-1:17 FidoCon '90
     be passed on as a starting kitty to the '91 folk.

     Then came the farewells.  And the end to this year's Region 1:17
     Convention.  Sure wish you could have been here.  It was great.

     See you in BC next year.

                        To Zone 2 ENET.SYSOP readers
                         Vince Perriello, 1:141/491

     I've had the distinct privilege of reading some excerpts from the
     ENET.SYSOP conference this weekend. Nice stuff. I'm recommending
     it to the local Poison Control Center in place of Ipecac.

     The messages place me in the position of having to respond to
     some of this stuff. You may not like it, but it serves you right
     for dragging my name into your crappy little war.

     I'll make you a deal: Don't use my name as a weapon again and I
     won't tell you how foolish you all look.

     Some personal notes now:

     To Peter Janssens:

     Bob and I did not pay our entire airfare, paid little for our
     meals, nothing for our lodging, and nothing for our registration.
     I'm telling you this to answer your little accusations against
     the Eurocon IV committee, because otherwise I would just say that
     it was none of your damned business.

     To Ron Dwight:

     Nice job on the revisionist history. If you're in need of some
     pocket money, there might still be some ex-Germans in South
     America who could use you.

     To the EuroCon V team:

     I hope you get it all together (with or without help from someone
     in Scandinavia). Bob and I are looking forward to an Italian
     Adventure next year.

     To the Eurocon IV team:

     Shit. I bet you thought the worst was over when everyone left.
     Listen, after all the shouting and BS is over, the fact remains
     that you did a great job and most people were extremely
     appreciative of your efforts, Bob and I among them.

     I can safely say that Eurocon IV is the best FidoCon I have yet
     attended on any Continent.

     To all of you:

     Good grief, Europe!  Are you trying to win some kind of award in
     American-style hooliganism?  There was a procedure, it was
     followed, and a site was chosen.  Grow up.

     I appreciate this opportunity to clear up some misstated facts
     (and to air my personal opinions). Send your flames to yourselves.
