                       Why Are They Doing This to Me?


     For  those of you who didn't already know,  I'm a general partner
     at System Enhancement Associates.  We've released  all  sorts  of
     goodies  to  the  public.  I'm sure most of you are familiar with
     our Robot and Xlatlist programs, not to mention SEAdog.

     But mostly we are known for ARC.  It's a nice little program,  if
     I  do  say  so  myself.   We  released  it  as  shareware  as  an
     experiment.  We frankly didn't expect shareware to work, but we'd
     do it the same if we had it to do over again.

     Lately we seem to have uncovered a  new  dimension  in  shareware
     that frankly disturbs us.  ARC is popular, and everyone wants the
     latest  version.  Also,  we released the sources,  which may have
     been a mistake (though I'd like to  think  not).  This  makes  us
     vulnerable to the destructive hacker.

     I hope you saw our notice a  few  weeks  back  about  ARC513.COM.
     Apparently someone has made a Trojan Horse version of ARC, and is
     distributing  it far and wide.  I even got a call from Infoworld.
     It seems  that  this  business  is  serious  enough  to  interest
     Infoworld  in  doing  an  article about it.  As if the whole flap
     about ARC513.COM wasn't enough, I've since heard of an ARC514.COM
     floating around, and even an ARC520.COM.

     This hurts.  I  hope  that  we've  sufficiently  established  our
     product  that  we can withstand a little of this,  though endless
     FAT-killer versions will cause us problems before too  long.  But
     meanwhile,  it  still  hurts.  What  did we ever do to anybody to
     deserve this?

     I'd really like to know where this is  coming  from.  I  remember
     last  year there was a big fuss about pirated software,  and many
     sysops started keeping track of who uploaded  what.  Has  anybody
     uploaded one of these things to your board?  If so,  who?  Please
     let us know.  If you  have  any  information,  anything  at  all,
     please  contact  me  at  1/1.  If  you  have a phone number or an
     address on whoever sent it to you, then please tell me that, too.
     I figure I'll probably have to crawl  through  several  links  of
     uploads  and  downloads  before  I  get  anywhere,   so  all  the
     information I can get will be none too little.

        | Alpha Computer Services' INTRCPT PD Util Does it Again! |
        +---------------------------------------------------------+

     A few weeks back I published a little note  here  about  a  small
     utility  called  INTRCPT  that  allows a PC/AT running DOS 3.2 to
     write 720k into 360k diskettes.  At that  time  I  said  that  it
     didn't work with DOS' DISKCOPY and DISKCOMP.

     Well,  the  problems  have  been  fixed and it works with ALL DOS
     utilities.  It  has  also  been  tested on as many programs as we
     have been able to lay our hands on,  including  1-2-3,  PC-Paint,
     Symphony  and  many others (too many...) and it has been found to
     be compatible with all of them.  The version of INTRCPT that  has
     solved the problems is now identified as INTRCPTX.

     Apparently both Microsoft and IBM had notified the author,  Sandy
     Zelkovitz of ACS, that it simply could not be done!  Well, it can
     be done, it has been done, so there!

     In  the  process  of  getting  this  little  gem to work so well,
     several undocumented DOS interrupt  functions  and  sub-functions
     were discovered,  and a list of these will be posted here as soon
     as it is ready. This should prove to be very interesting, so keep
     your eyes peeled for this one and don't forget to  pick  up  your
     copy of FidoNews at you local BBS!!!

     Thom:
          Jim   Butterfield   doesn't  include  any  sort   of   addressing
     information in articles. This makes it somewhat difficult to reach him
     by  FidoMail...  Would you please forward this message to  him?  Thank
     you.

     -------------

     Jim:
          I  have  been enjoying your column;  the one on users groups  was
     quite apropos,  as I am pr manager (and entertainment director) for  a
     brand new 'puter club, and sometimes it's hard to hold the interest of
     a group.  The next speaker I've arranged for is a hacker (in the  true
     sense of the word) and a software engineer. I think I'll have him read
     that  before he gives his presentation.  He does tend to talk in  very
     technical terms.
          What prompts this message is the column in fido319.  I am writing
     pd  talking software for the blind,  and one project that I have  been
     interested  in  taking on for some time is a conversion of  adventure,
     and perhaps some of the other text-type adventure games.
          I  need source code because I'm going to have to muck with a  lot
     of  the strings in order to make them sound intelligable  through  the
     votrax-based talker.  My preference in source is C,  because I know it
     well, but FORTRAN, Pascal, and BASIC would be suitable, too.
          I  know  that there is a C version of adventure out  there  some-
     place.  I  believe it was written in the BDS flavor,  but I'd be  sur-
     prised if there weren't an MS-DOS version floating around, too.
          That  game  has  been  my favorite since I  first  saw  it  on  a
     mainframe,  many moons ago, even though I have never solved it. One of
     these days....!
          Do you have any suggestions, ideas, and/or source code that might
     help me? I can be reached on Fido 147/1, MCI Mail to Remark bbs, or

                        SILICON MOUNTAIN CONFERENCE

                       IN COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO

                                   OF THE

                           INTERNATIONAL FIDO NET

                             AUGUST 14-17, 1986


     The Colorado Springs PC Users Group (COSUG) and the International
     Fido Net Administrators  will  planning  a  conference  for  Fido
     sysops  and  regional  and net coordinators in August,  1986,  in
     Colorado  Springs,   Colorado,   otherwise  known   as   "Silicon
     Mountain".  As presently being scheduled,  workshops and programs
     will take place on Friday, August 15, 1987, and Saturday,  August
     16,  1986.  The  conference  will provide an opportunity for Fido
     sysops throughout the world to come together and learn more about
     using Fido.  Regional coordinators and network hosts will have  a
     chance to discuss mutual problems.

     So far,  Tom Jennings,  Thom Henderson and Ken Kaplan have agreed
     to  come  and  speak.  Suggestions  are  invited  for  additional
     speakers  and  workshop leaders.  Programs will include "nuts and
     bolts" type technical discussions of common  sysop  problems  and
     more  specialized discussions of net and region coordination.  In
     addition we hope to have presentations on new software  programs,
     such as SEAdog,  which work with Fido,  and new hardware, such as
     optical disks and high speed modems.  Registration will start  on
     Thursday,  August 14, and Departure will be on Sunday, August 17,
     1986.  Spouses and  families  are  welcome,  and  family-oriented
     activities such as a trip up Pikes Peak, will be provided.

     Sometimes called "Silicon Mountain", because of the concentration
     of  high-tech,  military and industrial installations,  including
     the United States Space Command,  Colorado Springs  lies  at  the
     foot  of  Pikes Peak (elevation 14,410 feet),  at the edge of the
     Rocky Mountains,  in the western United States.  There  are  many
     tourist  attractions,  including  a Rodeo,  mountain climbing and
     hiking, and sight-seeing.  Because of the altitude (approximately
     6000 feet),  the weather should be very pleasant and  comfortable
     compared to the rest of the United States.

     We   are  looking  for  commercial  and  corporate  sponsors  and
     exhibitors to help with the costs,  as well as additional program
     topics  and  speakers.  Suggestions are welcome.  Ken Kaplan will
     be assigning the conference  a  net/node  number,  1/10.  Further
     information  concerning  costs,   expenses,   registration,   and
     programs  will  be  provided  soon.  Direct  airline  service  is
     available to Colorado Springs from many cities,  such as Chicago,
     Salt Lake, St. Louis, etc.

     Be sure to put the  Silicon  Mountain  Fido  Conference  on  your
     schedules  right  away.  Talk your friends and fellow sysops into
     coming also.  Air fares in the United States are very cheap,  and

     we  may  be  able  to get a special room rate for persons who are
     willing to share with someone else.

     Gee M. Wong, 1/100

                   Forcing Fido to return back to SEAdog

     There have been numerous reports collected by Fido Bugs West  and
     Fido Bugs East,  that both Fido 11v and 11w (and probably some of
     the earlier Fido releases as far back as 11q) may not always give
     up control of  the  system  after  a  caller  terminates  his/her
     session when the /E parameter is used to invoke Fido.

     This  small  problem  in  Fido  can  be a real nuisance to SEAdog
     owners who permit callers to drop into Fido,  but  also  wish  to
     make  use  of  DYNAMIC  CRASH mail during the day.  By having the
     system hung at Fido,  SEAdog is no  longer  in  control  and  the
     system is no longer available to accept incoming CRASH mail.

     So what I have done is to create a utility,  FIDOEXEC 2.2,  which
     addresses this  problem  by  monitoring  both  Fido  and  Carrier
     Detect.  This  utility  is being released as FIDOEX22.ARC,  which
     contains  FIDOEXEC.DOC,  FIDOEXEC.COM,  and  FIDOEXEC.ASM.   This
     utility  may be downloaded from 1/100,  and it is also being made
     available for distribution through 1/98 and 1/99.

     FIDOEXEC may be freely used in a noncommercial environment by all
     FidoNet Sysops,  who are registered with IFNA,  as shown  in  the
     most recent copy of NODELIST, or in a SEAdog environment operated
     by anyone who owns a legal copy of SEAdog.

     FIDOEXEC  may also be copy and distributed,  so long as no fee is
     charged  for  such  copying  or  distribution,  and  that  it  is
     distributed unmodified and in its entirety.

     FIDOEXEC  2.2 is currently available at 1/100,  and SEAdog owners
     may File Request FIDOEX22.ARC from the Pickup Directory.

     When FIDOEXEC  is  invoked,  it  will  in  turn  invoke  FIDO_IBM
     (current  version only supports the IBM version of Fido),  and it
     will also monitor carrier.  If FIDOEXEC determines  that  carrier
     has  been  lost  but  Fido has not release control of the system,
     then FIDOEXEC will simulate the keying of a  Control-C  from  the
     console  by a Sysop in order to force Fido to terminate.  If Fido
     does not  terminate  after  the  first  Conrol-C  is  entered  by
     FIDOEXEC,  then  it  simulate  entering Control-C up to four more
     times until Fido gives up control.  If however,  after the  fifth
     Control-C,  Fido  does  not  give up control of the system,  then
     FIDOEXEC will force a warm reboot.

     Lastly,  contributions (yes please give), if you use this utility
     on your system (be honest), please consider making a contribution
     (whatever you can afford to give) to:

                     Microcomputer Managers Association
                     ==================================


     There must be hundreds of people  throughout  the  United  States
     that  coordinate  the use of microcomputers within their company.
     This  includes  the   responsibility   for   negotiating   vendor
     contracts,  evaluating/selecting hardware and software standards,
     perform internal training and consulting services,  handle custom
     programming    requests,     and    provide    a    comprehensive
     hardware/software maintenance services.

     I'm one of those people and I would  like  to  establish  contact
     with people performing similar services for their companies.  I'd
     like  to  discuss  hardware/software  standards   and   selection
     processes,  share  vendor  evaluations,  compare support services
     planning,  networking plans,  use of "compatibles"  and  staffing
     services.

     It may be that a group along these lines has already been formed.
     If so,  I would appreciate someone providing me with a contact so
     I could obtain more information.  It would be best if I could tie
     into an existing group.

     If no such group exists, then perhaps we could form one along the
     lines of FIDONET.  With the work being  done  with  ECHOMAIL,  we
     could effectively use FIDONET to form a national special interest
     group.

     Please direct any replies to:

                 Alfred Anderson
                 FIDO 14/61         (AKA 14/0)

     If you're interested,  send me a message and I'll let you know if
     someone has provided the name of a national  organization  or  if
     we're going to try and form one on our own.

     Oh, if you are not a Microcomputer Manager yourself, but you work
     for  a  company that has one,  could you pass this message to the
     appropriate person?

     DataFlex Fido, 103/511
     Modem Help West, 1/110

          How to get help for that modem that won't work with Fido


     Some  of  you  may  not  be aware of this,  but a few months back
     FidoNet Administration set up a number of Help Nodes to take  the
     load  of  providing tech help for Fido users away from TJ and the
     main network nodes and distribute it  by  type  to  a  number  of
     volunteer sysops on the network.

     Well,  two  nodes  were set up for Modem Help.  One is Jim Ryan's
     Fido (1/108) and the other is my board (1/110).  Our goal  is  to
     help  people who are having problems with their modems and cannot
     get them to work with Fido.

     We are here to help,  but we need to get very specific info to be
     able  to  assist you.  For this reason I am taking the liberty of
     putting together a little template of questions that  you  should
     answer  in  your messages to us regarding modem problems.  If you
     provide all this info we will be better able to help you and  you
     will  save  your  time  and money.  We need the following info on
     EVERY request for assistance:

        FIRST OF ALL, HAVE YOU READ THE FIDO MANUAL?

        (Amazing how many people refuse to read a manual... )

             1) Type of computer you are using
             2) Configuration (memory, # of com ports, etc.)
             3) Operating System and version number
             4) Type of modem
             5) Internal or external installation?
             6) If external, cable configuration
             7) Description of problem, to include:

                a) Does Fido answer?
                b) Does Fido dial out?
                c) Which communications program(s) do you have
                   that WILL work with the little beast?
                d) What have you tried to get it to work (Fido

                         WelchNet Goes Down


           Effective May 26,  WelchNet (and I) will be moved to a  new
     phone number (in Berkeley,  California) and will become a private
     FidoMail-only system.  As a result,  direct BBS support for  GAGS
     will  end,  but  I'll  still be available to answer questions and
     such via FidoMail,  and of course by phone and  U.S.  Mail.  I'll
     also  respond  to  mail  to 'mwelch' on BIX (the Byte Information
     Exchange).


     New GAGS* Version:

     In June,  I will release a new version of GAGS*,  with  just  two
     minor  changes:  the  address  and  phone  number will be changed
     throughout,  and I will make a change to the "Save  Game"  option
     that  will  eliminate  a  bug and also prevent the overwriting of
     files.  (Some Fido sysops had  pointed  out  that  when  allowing
     callers  to  exit  Fido  and  play  a GAGS game,  the less polite
     callers have chosen to  save  their  games  to  file  names  like
     "\FIDO\USER.BBS" or "\COMMAND.COM.")

        At  that  time,  I'll  send a postcard to all registered users
     notifying them of my new address and phone number, but GAGS users
     who weren't having troubles with the save-file  option  shouldn't
     bother upgrading.

        Since  WelchNet will be a private node,  with the number known
     only to the local host,  you should not attach files to WelchNet,
     and I will no longer be able to afford outgoing file transfers.

        I've tried to locate new BBSs to service callers interested in
     the  message  areas  I  had.  The following list may be of use to
     people who did or didn't call WelchNet during its  14  months  of
     operations:


     Seequa:

        WelchNet's  Seequa  messages and files have been moved over to
     Dog Lab,  run by longtime  Seequa  Chameleon  victim/owner  Bruce
     Oblander  at  (415)  594-0781.   (San  Carlos,  California;  Fido

            European FIDO node for media and radio enthusiasts!!

     by Jonathan Marks, "Media Network" Producer, Radio Netherlands,
     Hilversum, Holland.


     A little radio background
     -------------------------

     At this moment,  hundreds of English language radio stations  are
     on  the  air  analysing  world  affairs.  They  can  be  received
     anywhere,  from Canberra to Cologne,  from Holland  to  Hawaii  -
     providing you're carrying the right type of radio.  The events of
     the  last  few  weeks  have  made  people  even more aware of how
     important international communication is.

     In the last five years,  there has been a boom  in  sophisticated
     portable radios.  They can cover not only medium wave (or "AM" as
     it's  often  refered to in North America) and VHF (or "FM"),  but
     stations that operate on the dial space  in  between.  This  lies
     between  3  and 30 Megahertz,  and is often termed the "shortwave
     band". The new generation of receivers has successfully destroyed
     the image of shortwave as something to do with  "ham"  radio  and
     giant  antennas  on  the  rooftop.  Today,  shortwave is the news
     medium,  easy to access in English wherever you happen to be.  It
     is invaluable for world news and stock exchange information.  But
     you need to know what you're doing.


     Wide choice of receivers
     ------------------------

     There are currently over 70 different shortwave receivers on  the
     world  market.  You'll  find  them  at  many duty-free outlets in
     Europe,  and in larger electrical stores.  The  problem  is  that
     many  sales  assistants  don't  do  much travelling,  and they're
     advice   and   background   knowledge   is   often   innaccurate.
     Demonstrations  under  a ceiling full of flourescent lights often
     produces a loud buzz when the radio is switched to the  shortwave
     range.  Cheaper  sets  use  the  conventional  "pointer and dial"
     method  to  indicate  where  you  are  on  the   dial.   However,
     manufacturers   such  as  Sony,   Grundig,   Silver,   Panasonic,
     Nordmende,   and  Philips  currently  market   so-called   "world
     receivers"   with   a  digital  frequency  readout.   Instead  of
     searching a crowded dial looking for English voices,  if you know
     that,  say,  Voice  of  America is on 6040 kilohertz,  you simply
     twist the tuning knob until the display shows 6040,  turn up  the
     volume,  and  there's the station.  Some more expensive models go
     even further.  The tuning knob is replaced or supplemented  by  a
     calculator  style  keypad.   If  you  want  to  listen  to  Radio
     Netherlands transmitting to North  America  pressing  6-1-6-5  at
     0230  GMT is sufficient.  Shortwave signals get much further than

     AM or VHF.



     So whats the connection between shortwave and FIDO?
     --------------------------------------------------

     For  the  last  25  years,   one   non-commercial   international
     broadcasting station,  Radio Netherlands, has been broadcasting a
     programme for radio enthusiasts.  Formerly called "DX Juke  Box",
     the  programme  has  now  been  remodelled  and  is called "Media
     Network".  It is broadcast each THURSDAY  on  Radio  Netherlands'
     English  Service.  In  over  30 minutes,  we illustrate events in
     broadcasting from all over the  world.  There's  an  emphasis  on
     radio  broadcasting,  though  an increasing amount of material to
     interest the satellite and  computer  enthusiast  is  also  being
     included.  A  weekly  propagation  report  has  built  up a loyal
     following,  especially amongst those who use computer  programmes
     to help plan listening.

     Contrary  to what one might first expect,  computers have already
     reached listeners in developing  countries  such  as  India,  Sri
     Lanka,  Malaysia,  and Indonesia.  Indeed, some letters have been
     received from listeners in the region sent  in  on  floppy  disk!
     Because of listener demand from more news of developments in both
     the computing as well the communication field,  regular items are
     included in Media  Network  under  the  INFODUTCH  column,  where
     INFODUTCH  stands  for  Information  Of  Direct  Use  To Computer
     Hobbyists !  Home computers (e.g.  Sinclair, BBC, MSX) have found
     their way into schools and colleges in many parts  of  Asia,  and
     also  in  West  Africa.  Listeners  in  Nigeria  ask for computer
     listings to experiment in their part of the world.

     RN listeners, with suitable equipment,  are now be able to access
     English  language  material  on  the computer in one of two ways.
     They can either phone the number in Hilversum direct by  dialling
     the  international  exchange in your country,  i.e.  011 in North
     America,  010 in the UK,  followed by  31  for  Holland,  35  for
     Hilversum,  and  then  45395.  Radio  Netherlands material can be
     found in message/file section number 2.  Your modem needs  to  be
     capable  of  decoding  CCITT tones (standard in Europe),  and our
     computer will automatically switch to either 300/300  or  1200/75
     Baud.  We're  working  on the 1200/1200 and 2400/2400 capability.
     You can also use FIDO,  address messages to  Jonathan  Marks,  at
     FIDO net 500, node 202.  The following data is now on the system:

     1. Texts of consumer tests on communications equipment, i.e.  new
        shortwave radios, antennas, and computer interfaces.

     2. Current  radio  propagation  information,  updated  regularly.
        Unlike medium wave and VHF, shortwave conditions are dependant
        on the sun and the radiation it gives to the earth.  The solar
        data  is  montiored  continuously  for  Media   Network,   and
        forecasts  (similar  to  weather  forecasts)  are  used  by an
        estimated 250,000 listeners worldwide on a weekly basis.

     Fidonews                     Page 14                   2 Jun 1986


     3. BASICODE  programs  received  from   listeners   abroad,   and
        developed by Radio Netherlands.

     4. Communications/Broadcasting news.

     What else?
     ----------

     Here's  an  idea of some of the subjects being dealt in the radio
     programme over the next few weeks.


     Thursday:  May 15th Media Network "All Set  for  the  Sun".  This
     week's  Media  Network  will  include  an interview with Dr David
     Marsden of the  European  Space  Agency's  Technology  Centre  at
     Noordwijk  on  the  Dutch North Sea Coast.  He'll be looking at a
     project that should have been launched today,  but is still ready
     to  explore the sun's poles.  It will help to unravel some of the
     mysteres of the solar wind, which in turn affects shortwave radio
     reception   conditions.   The   programme   will   also   include
     clandestine  radio  news from John Campbell,  and we hope to have
     media news from our African correspondent, Richard Ginbey.

     Thursday:  May 22nd Media Network "Paris  Reportage".  This  week
     we'll be linking to the studios of Radio France Internationale to
     find out the results of the European DX Council conference in the
     French   capital.   Results  of  the  EDXC  Computer  survey  are
     expected,  plus developments on  the  shortwave  receiver  front.
     Yaesu  will  be talking about their Computer Aided Tuning system,
     and we look  at  the  new  receiver  from  Japan  Radio  Company.
     They'll also be media news from Andy Sennitt.

     Thursday:  May  29th  Media  Network "News Review" .  This week's
     edition will carry a round-up of media developments,  plus a look
     at  new equipment.  Victor Goonetilleke provides Asian media news
     round-up.

     Thursday:  June 5th Media Network  "AM  Stereo  Gone  Down,  down
     under?"  We  look at the medium wave stereo concept launched back
     in 1982 in the United States,  and later  in  Australia.  Has  it
     succeeded? Why will it never catch on in Europe.

     Thursday:   June  11th  Media  Network  "News  Review"  including
     contributions  from  clandestine  columnist  John  Campbell   and
     African  media reporter Richard Ginbey.  We'll also have a survey
     of new publications for the summer (at least for us)

     Thursday:  June  19th  Media  Network  "Vintage  Wireless  Lives"
     There's  a growing value in the "junk" valve/tube radios that get
     stored away in cellars  and  the  garden  shed.  The  numbers  of
     "antique"  radio  collectors is on a sharp increase in Europe and
     North America.  Some manufacturers  have  even  started  to  make
     "reproduction"  copies  of receivers that made in the 1930's.  We
     look at the trends, the current market situation,  and why people
     want to collect sets that Grandpa used to fiddle with.

     Tuning in the shortwave programme
     ---------------------------------

     Media  Network  is  broadcast each Thursday by Radio Netherlands.
     To find us on shortwave,  use the guide below.  It is arranged to
     cover  one whole day of broadcasting.  The 0530 UTC broadcast is,
     therefore,  put at the end of the list since although the day has
     changed  in The Netherlands,  it is still the previous evening on
     the West Coast of North America.  Confusing perhaps,  but if  you
     look at a globe you'll see the reason more clearly.

     Bonaire  Relay  Station,   Caribbean,   M-  Madagascar,   Africa.
     Transmissions not directed to your area may be audible, e.g.  the
     0430  UTC broadcast is currently being heard in Australasia,  but
     reception is generally not as  reliable  as  those  transmissions
     beamed your way.

                           THE WORLD OF COMPUTING
                        written by Reuven M. Lerner
                              FidoMail 107/233


         Hello,  and welcome back!  As I mentioned last  time,  I  was
     planning on doing a report about some educational software that I
     had  looked  at,  and discuss the future of educational software.
     Unfortunately,  my school had a fire,  and although there was  no
     structural  damage  to  the  computer  center  or to the machines
     themselves,  we have been denied  access  to  that  wing  of  the
     building  until  everything's  cleaned  up.  Which means that for
     now,  I just  have  to  talk  about  the  future  of  educational
     computing.  But  before  I  get to that,  let's get to the latest
     news from Microsoft!

         I  am  absolutely  delighted  to  report  that  not  only  is
     Microsoft  coming  out  with  a  version  3.0 of their Word word-
     processor,  but they are also taking copy-protection off  of  it!
     We know that we're headed for good news in protection when one of
     the  largest  (if  not  THE  largest) producers of software takes
     protection off.  Let's hope that they are,  in fact,  the "IBM of
     software," and the rest of the industry will follow their lead.


         Educational Software

         As  I said,  I was going to review some educational packages,
     but due to the fire in my school (we're back in the building now,
     but the computers are not available), it's a little difficult.  I
     have used them before,  though,  so let me at least tell you  the
     problems that I have with some of the packages.

         First of all, they're unprofessionally done.  I was astounded
     when a program costing about $25 was easily breakable by Control-
     c,  and  then  listable and changeable!  Any software company who
     makes software geared for younger children should have it just as
     bulletproof as  programs  made  for  busy  executives  who  don't
     understand  computers  either.  Half of the sixth-graders I spoke
     with knew that to break their own programs it took Control-c, how
     many do you think would try it on other programs?

         Second of all, the instructions on most of them are pathetic.
     As far as I can tell,  they're made so that a  math  teacher  can
     plug it into the computer in their room,  and let the kids try to
     guess how to factor trinomials,  or something of that sort.  When
     I couldn't understand what to do next,  I wondered what a teacher
     who has never used a computer would say?  Do you think that she'd
     be  eager  to  bring  in  a  computer  often  if  there  was  the
     possibility of a fatal error?

         An  offshoot  of  that  idea  is  the  whole  "user-friendly"
     concept.  All of these companies try to tell us how user-friendly
     their package is,  as opposed to the others.  I hate to  say  it,
     but  producing nice-looking documentation on a Macintosh is nice,
     but doesn't add anything to the quality of the  writing.  I  work
     Fidonews                     Page 17                   2 Jun 1986


     with  teachers  who are nervous about using cassette recorders or
     VCRs.  Shouldn't there be clear instructions to get them calm  in
     front of an overpowering machine?

         Well,  now that I've done some criticism, let me say that all
     in all,  once you got around the quirks and documentation,  there
     was a good program in there.  Most of the programs worked as they
     should,  and  are  good for giving students practice in different
     subjects.  But there's a lot out there (I know, I get many of the
     catalogs).  How can a school decide what to get?

         They should firstly deal with a large manufacturer.  I  don't
     know  any school administrator who would feel comfortable dealing
     mail-order to get a low price,  and then realize that he  or  she
     had  lost  money because there was no support (not to knock mail-
     order...it's just not for amateurs).  Deal with a local  computer
     store with support and knowledgeable salespeople.

         As you would guess by now,  I also would require that schools
     only buy unprotected software.  What kind of lessons to kids  get
     when they learn that you have to copy software because there's no
     money?  I'm sure that that's where many kids learn about copying.

         So  where's educational computing going?  I see a bigger boom
     in  it  in  the  near  future,  with  better  documentation,   no
     protection  (many  catalogs have fewer protected than unprotected
     software,  a change from a year or two ago),  and better  skills.
     There's more high-school software out now than there ever was.

         If you're an educator,  please write to me,  and tell me your
     opinions about software.  I also suggest that  you  subscribe  to
     Classroom  Computer  Learning,  put  out  by  the  same people as
     Learning magazine.  It has interesting games for  all  levels  of
     students, programming instruction, and a lot more.  It's the sign
     of things to come.


         Computer Humor

         I  just  got  the  April  issue  of Byte,  and if you haven't
     already,  try reading the April  articles!  Ask  BYTE  is  really
     funny,  and  the  last  two  articles in the Features section are
     almost real articles, except for some weird ideas put in.

         We computer people as a breed don't have much  humor  out.  I
     know,  many BBS' have joke sections, but if any of you have a lot
     of computer jokes, send it out to all of us!  We need a good dose
     every once in a while.


         Next time

         I know that it was shorter this time,  but I'm still  getting
     over a big cold and have,  literally,  ten things to do.  Because
     of that,  I'll probably be looking into multitasking  next  time.
     Best wishes for a warm spring, and happy computing!

                              Position Wanted


     A friend (no,  not me) is looking for a new  job  that  can  take
     advantage of her editing and communications skills.

        She  is  currently  a  commercial  proofreader  with extensive
     proofreading and copy-editing experience,  as well as  experience
     (15+  years)  at  various administrative,  sales,  and management
     tasks.

        She's interested in a position with more variety  and  respon-
     sibility  than  her current (proofreading) work,  hopefully a job
     with some room to grow and potential  for  advancement.  She  now
     lives in Massachusetts,  but is willing to relocate for the right
     position.

        She is an enthusiastic Atari 800 owner,  fluent in BASIC  (for
     what that's worth now) and involved in a user group. She also has
     some experience with the IBM PC and Apple II.

        If  you  know  of a company that might benefit from her skills
     and interests,  please drop a line so I can let her know  who  to
     contact.

     Send  FidoMail  to  Mark  Welch  to  125/459,  or  mail on BIX to
     'mwelch',   or  call  Mark  Welch  (at  work)   at   800-227-8365

     Note:  No profit is made from  the  sale  of  the  Public  Domain

     running  a  BBS  to  receive  file  submissions,  and inspecting,
     cataloguing, archiving and maintaining the files.  Obtaining this
     software  yourself  through  the  use  of a computer with a modem
     using commercial phone access would cost you much more than  what
     we charge for the service.

     prepared on.  The following choices are available:

           - IBM PC-DOS Backup utility
