     =================================================================

     Greetings,

     Last week's editorial about echomail and it's "is it copyright" or
     not, did provide some interesting comments.  Some of you said, it is
     not subject to copyright laws, some ofcourse maintain it is.

     As mentioned, I have my own views on the subject:
     'Unless so stated in each and every message posted, such messages
     are _not_ copyrighted'.

     However, having said that, I saw an interesting article on one of the
     list servers, which makes interesting reading.  The article is below,
     should you be interested in it, for further reference.  It applies
     mainly to Zone 1, but then, it also makes reference to the Berne
     Convention.  Read it and do make your own assumptions.

     Who said my predecessor died?  Well, be informed that he is well and
     kicking. :-)  His eye is still bothering him, but for the rest he's
     fit!   Keep and get well Zorch.

     Happy reading,

                          When a Plan Doesn't Come Together...
                                  The End of a Dream?
                       Douglas Myers, 1:270/720, doug@mdtnbbs.com

     Fido's most persevering conflict is that between technical
     organization and social organization.  At times it's bitter, but
     there's an awareness in both camps that they really need each other.
     Without the technical organization, the net doesn't stay connected.
     Without the social organization, there's no need to be connected.

     Presently, the net is ruled by it's technical organization.  Typical
     of those things designed by a technician, the basic organization is
     efficient, authoritative, and very logical.  And, as typical, the
     organization falters when dealing with the social issues of right,
     justice, and feelings.

     Those of a more social bent would prefer democratic election for all
     offices, and even issues.  They've made significant progress at the
     net and regional levels.  Typically these elections are slow and
     inefficient, but proponents feel that they better deal with social
     issues. Until recently, though, there had been no democratic
     elections at the zone level.

     The scene for Fido's first democratic election in 1997 was a strange
     one.  It involved an office, Zone Echomail Coordinator, which wasn't
     even "real" in that the position is not mentioned in Policy 4, Fido's
     governing document.

     Many feel to this day that the position is not even necessary.
     Nonetheless, the position was offered to the sysops of Zone 1 for
     their selection.

     Many feel the election failed.  In the manner of elections, it was a
     loud and hotly contested affair.  And, in the ultimate analysis, it
     produced a candidate who didn't survive his first term, judged by the
     technical and social proponents alike to be unsuited to the job.
     Now, in the selection of his replacement, it appears that the
     technical leadership has declared the grand experiment a failure and
     will simply select his replacement.

     Is the dream of the social organizers dead?

     Probably for now <sigh>.  It's still theoretically possible for Bob
     Satti to insist on a sysop-level vote, but it would be at the risk of
     antagonizing the RECC, whit whom he's working well right now.  It's
     still theoretically possible that the Regional Echomail Coordinator
     Council charged with determining how the next ZEC is to be selected,
     will ignore the feedback from their regions that the sysops just
     don't care to go through another election.
     It's still theoretically possible for the sysops, possibly stirred by
     this rhetoric, to convince the individual REC's that they truly want
     FIDONEWS 15-39               Page 3                   28 Sep 1998


     such an election.  But then, it's still theoretically possible that
     there will be peace in the middle east and that the internet will
     shut down in favor of BBS's across the world.

     I don't believe that we'll see a sysop-level vote for a zone office
     for a long time, and I wanted that because I'd caught a piece of the
     dream myself.
     But I don't think it's the end of sysop-level influence at the zone
     level either.  Though it's an evolutionary truth that authoritative
     organizations tend to lose touch with their constituency, I don't
     think this process is complete with Fido yet.  For whatever reason,
     Bob Satti, as the head of this organization, _did_ put the election
     on the table in the first place.  The RC's who make up the zone
     organization still takes input directly from the sysops. Even if
     there are varying degrees of sincerity.  Even if some only make the
     pretense.  It's significant that the form is still in place.

     For my own part in all this, I plan to continue to work within the
     system, to keep the dream alive as best I can :)

     R17 Website
     09/25/98 05:23 pm

     G'day!

     I'ed like to take a sec and introduce myself ... Hi, my name is Kevin.
     I live in Calgary Alberta Canada and I have have been a member of
     Fidonet from about 1989. I still enjoy this type of networking and
     hope Fidonet still has it's place in the future.

     Just the other day Bob Seaborn, REC17, and myself were chatting and
     he asked me if I'd be interested in developing a Website for Region
     17, I accepted, and R17's site was born.

     As the designer of the site, I'm very happy to promote R17's site on
     the Internet, and hope this generates more sysops/users for our
     region.

     Welcome!

                                 ARTICLES
     =================================================================


     What is a copyright?

     A copyright gives the owner of a creative work the right to keep
     others from using the work without the owner's permission. The key
     to understanding copyright law is to understand the difference
     between an idea and the expression of the idea. Copyright applies
     only to a particular expression, not to the ideas or facts underlying
     the expression. For instance, copyright may protect a particular
     song, novel or computer game about a romance in space, but it cannot
     protect the underlying idea of having a love affair among the stars.

     More specifically, a creative work (often referred to as a "work of
     authorship") must meet all of these three criteria to be protected by
     copyright:
     It must be original. In other words, the author must have created
     rather than copied it.
     It must be fixed in a tangible (concrete) medium of expression. For
     example, it might be expressed on paper, audio or video tape, computer
     disk, clay or canvas.
     It must have at least some creativity--that is, it must be produced by
     an exercise of human intellect. There is no hard and fast rule as to
     how much creativity is enough. To give an example, it must go beyond
     the creativity found in the telephone white pages, which involve a
     non-discretionary alphabetic listing of telephone numbers rather than
     a creative selection of listings.

     How long does a copyright last?

     For works published after 1977, the copyright lasts for the life of
     the author plus 50 years. However, if the work is a work for hire
     (that is, the work is done in the course of employment or has been
     specifically commissioned) or is published anonymously or under a
     pseudonym, the copyright lasts between 75 and 100 years, depending
     on the date the work is published.

     If the work was published before 1978 and the copyright has been
     properly renewed, the copyright expires 75 years after date of
     publication. If the work was created, but not published, before
     1978, the copyright lasts for the life of the author plus 50 years.
     However, even if the author died over 50 years ago, the copyright in
     an unpublished work lasts until December 31, 2002. And if such a
     work is published before 2003, the copyright lasts until December 31,
     2027.

     International Copyright Protection.

     Copyright protection rules are fairly similar worldwide, due to
     several international copyright treaties, the most important of
     which is the Berne Convention. Under this treaty, all member countries
     --and there are more than 100, including virtually all industrialized
     nations--must afford copyright protection to authors who are nationals
     FIDONEWS 15-39               Page 6                   28 Sep 1998


     of any member country. This protection must last for at least the life
     of the author plus 50 years, and must be automatic without the need
     for the author to take any legal steps to preserve the copyright.

     In addition to the Berne Convention, the GATT (General Agreement on
     Tariffs and Trade) treaty contains a number of provisions that affect
     copyright protection in signatory countries. Together, the Berne
     Copyright Convention and the GATT treaty allow U.S. authors to enforce
     their copyrights in most industrialized nations, and allow the
     nationals of those nations to enforce their copyrights in the U.S.

     With one important exception, you should assume that every work is
     protected by copyright unless you can establish that it is not. As
     mentioned above, you can't rely on the presence or absence of a
     copyright notice ((c)) to make this determination, because a notice
     is not required for works published after March 1, 1989. And even for
     works published before 1989, the absence of a copyright notice may
     not affect the validity of the copyright.

     The exception is for materials put to work under the "fair use rule."
     This rule recognizes that society can often benefit from the
     unauthorized use of copyrighted materials when the purpose of the
     use serves the ends of scholarship, education or an informed public.
     For example, scholars must be free to quote from their research
     resources in order to comment on the material.

     When Copying Is OK: The 'Fair Use' Rule
     by Stephen Fishman Copyright (c) Nolo Press

     Sooner or later, almost all writers quote or closely paraphrase what
     others have written. For example:
     Andy, putting together a newsletter on his home computer, reprints an
     editorial he likes from a daily newspaper.
     Phil, a biographer and historian, quotes from several unpublished
     letters and diaries written by his subject.

     Regina, a freelance writer, closely paraphrases two paragraphs from
     the Encyclopedia Britannica in an article she's writing.
     Sylvia, a poet, quotes a line from a poem by T.S. Eliot in one of her
     own poems.
     Donnie, a comedian, writes a parody of the famous song "Blue Moon" he
     performs in his comedy act.

     Assuming the material quoted in these examples is protected by
     copyright, do Phil, Regina, Sylvia, Andy and Donnie need permission
     from the author or other copyright owner to use it? It may surprise
     you to learn that the answer is "not necessarily."

     Under the "fair use" rule of copyright law, an author may make
     limited use of another author's work without asking permission. The
     fair use privilege is perhaps the most significant limitation on a
     copyright owner's exclusive rights. If you write or publish, you
     need a basic understanding of what is and is not fair use.

     FIDONEWS 15-39               Page 7                   28 Sep 1998


     Uses That Are Generally Fair Uses.

     Subject to some general limitations discussed later in this article,
     the following types of uses are usually deemed fair uses:
     Criticism and comment--for example, quoting or excerpting a work in
     a review or criticism for purposes of illustration or comment.

     News reporting--for example, summarizing an address or article, with
     brief quotations, in a news report.
     Research and scholarship--for example, quoting a short passage in a
     scholarly, scientific or technical work for illustration or clarifi-
     cation of the author's observations.
     Nonprofit educational uses--for example, photocopying of limited
     portions of written works by teachers for classroom use.
     Parody--that is, a work that ridicules another, usually well-known,
     work by imitating it in a comic way.

     In most other situations, copying is not legally a fair use. Without
     an author's permission, such a use violates the author's copyright.

     Violations often occur when the use is motivated primarily by a
     desire for commercial gain. The fact that a work is published
     primarily for private commercial gain weighs against a finding of
     fair use. For example, using the Bob Dylan line "You don't need a
     weatherman to know which way the wind blows" in a poem published in
     a small literary journal would probably be a fair use; using the same
     line in an advertisement for raincoats probably would not be.

     A commercial motive doesn't always disqualify someone from claiming a
     fair use. A use that benefits the public can qualify as a fair use,
     even if it makes money for the user.

     For example, a vacuum cleaner manufacturer was permitted in its
     advertising to quote from a Consumer Reports article comparing vacuum
     cleaners. Why? The ad significantly increased the number of people
     exposed to the Consumers Union's evaluations and thereby disseminated
     helpful consumer information. The same rationale probably applies to
     the widespread practice of quoting from favorable reviews in
     advertisements for books, films and plays.

     Copying From Unpublished Materials.

     When it comes to fair use, unpublished works are inherently different
     from published works. Publishing an author's unpublished work before
     he or she has authorized it infringes upon the author's right to
     decide when and whether the work will be made public. Some courts
     have held that fair use never applies to unpublished material.

     As you might expect, publishers, authors' groups, biographers and
     historians were highly critical of this view. They got Congress to
     amend the fair use provision in the Copyright Act to make clear that
     the fact that a work is unpublished weighs against fair use, but is
     not determinative in and of itself. If the other fair use factors
     favor fair use, it can be permissible to use part of an unpublished
     work without permission. This is particularly likely where the use
     benefits the public by furthering the fundamental purpose of the
     FIDONEWS 15-39               Page 8                   28 Sep 1998


     copyright laws--the advancement of human knowledge. For example, a
     court held that it was a fair use for a biographer to use a modest
     amount of material from unpublished letters and journals by the
     author Richard Wright. (Wright v. Warner Books, Inc., 953 F.2d 731
     (2d Cir. 1991).)

     When Is a Use a 'Fair Use'?

     There are five basic rules to keep in mind when deciding whether or
     not a particular use of an author's work is a fair use:

     Rule 1: Are You Just Copying or Creating Something New?
     The purpose and character of your intended use of the material
     involved is the single most important factor in determining whether
     a use is a fair use.
     The question to ask here is whether you are merely copying someone
     else's work verbatim or instead using it to help create something
     new. The Supreme Court calls such a new work "transformative." The
     more transformative your work, the more likely your use is a fair
     use.

     Rule 2: Don't Compete With the Source You're Copying From.
     Without consent, you ordinarily cannot use another person's protected
     expression in a way that impairs (or even potentially impairs) the
     market for his or her work. Thus, if you want to use an author's
     protected expression in a work of your own that is similar to the
     prior work and aimed at the same market, your intended use isn't
     likely a fair use.

     For example, say Nick, a golf pro, writes a book on how to play golf.
     Not a good putter himself, he copies several brilliant paragraphs on
     putting from a book by Lee Trevino, one of the greatest putters in
     golf history. Because Nick intends his book to compete with and
     hopefully supplant Trevino's, this use could not be a fair use. In
     effect, Nick is trying to use Trevino's protected expression to eat
     into the sales of Trevino's own book.

     An interesting example is when a teacher copies parts of books for
     students to use. In one recent case, a group of seven major publishers
     went to court and stopped a duplicating business from copying excerpts
     from books without permission, compiling them into "course packets"
     and selling them to college students.

     Rule 3: Giving the Author Credit Doesn't Let You Off the Hook.
     Some people mistakenly believe that they can use any material as long
     as they properly give the author credit. Not true. Giving credit and
     fair use are completely separate concepts. Either you have the right
     to use another author's material under the fair use rule or you
     don't. The fact that you attribute the material to the other author
     doesn't change that.

     Rule 4: The More You Take, the Less Fair Your Use Is Likely to Be.
     The more material you take, the less likely it is that your use will
     be a fair use. However, to preserve the free flow of information,
     authors have more leeway in using material from factual works
     (scholarly, technical, scientific works, etc.) than to works of fancy
     FIDONEWS 15-39               Page 9                   28 Sep 1998


     such as novels, poems and plays. This is true especially where it's
     necessary to use extensive quotations to ensure the accuracy of the
     information conveyed.

     As a general rule, never quote more than a few successive paragraphs
     from a book or article, or take more than one chart or diagram. It
     is never proper to include an illustration or other artwork in a book
     or newsletter without the artist's permission. Don't quote more than
     one or two lines from a poem.

     Many publishers require their authors to obtain permission from an
     author to quote more then a specified number of words, ranging from
     about 100 to 1000 words.

     Contrary to what many people believe, there is no absolute word limit
     on fair use. For example, it is not always okay to take one paragraph
     or less than 200 words. Copying 12 words from a 14-word haiku poem
     wouldn't be fair use. Nor would copying 200 words from a work of 300
     words likely qualify as a fair use. However, copying 2000 words from
     a work of 500,000 words might be fair.

     It all depends on the circumstances.

     Rule 5: The Quality of the Material Used Is as Important as the
     Quantity.
     The more important the material is to the original work, the less
     likely your use of it will be considered a fair use.

     In one famous case, The Nation magazine obtained a copy of Gerald
     Ford's memoirs before their publication. In the magazine's article
     about the memoirs, only 300 words from Ford's 200,000-word manuscript
     were quoted verbatim. The Supreme Court ruled that this was not a
     fair use because the material quoted (dealing with the Nixon pardon)
     was the "heart of the book ...the most interesting and moving parts
     of the entire manuscript," and that pre-publication disclosure of
     this material would cut into value or sales of the book.

     Determining whether your intended use of another author's protected
     work constitutes a fair use is usually not difficult. It's really
     just a matter of common sense. There is no more commonsensical
     definition of fair use than the golden rule: Take from someone else
     only what you wouldn't mind someone taking from you.

     All Aboard?
     By Andrea Santos, 1:135/382, asantos@santronics.com

     We're quickly closing in on the one year mark since a node physically
     located in Malaysia was nodelisted in Zone 1's, Region 12,
     specifically, Net 163.  Though the node in question is no longer in
     Fidonet, the ensuing problems which caused him to seek a node
     assignment outside of his Zone are, and nor are these problems
     limited to Zone 6.
     FIDONEWS 15-39               Page 10                  28 Sep 1998


     Anyone got a few rafts?

     Upon learning of the above geographic abnormality, many expressed
     concern.  Was this a blatant shirking of the suspect P4 geographic
     boundaries clause by Net 163, or was there a serious breakdown
     underway which required attention?  After contacting a few nodes in
     that Zone, I concluded the latter and was vocal in my comments in
     various administrative echos for the need to resolve the problems,
     beginning with the Zone Coordinator. Both NCs and RCs in that Region
     had disappeared without notice, and either grunt nodes were finding it
     impossible to obtain a local nodelisting, or NCs had no uplink to
     submit updated Nodelist segments.

     With so much discussion going on at the time about this nodelisting,
     I remained cautiouly optimistic that the "powers that be" would get
     involved.  Surely, it was not in the best interests of a sysop located
     half way around the world to have to seek out a node assignment here.
     More importantly, the longer term viability of an entire Zone seemed
     questionable.

     My optimism ended after being copied a Netmail this past June from an
     NC in Zone 1 who had been contacted about nodelisting a Sysop from
     India. Upon receiving this mail, I contacted the NC of the India Net
     to see if the sysop in question could be nodelisted in his
     geographically assigned Net.  This was done in quick fashion, however,
     you won't find this nodelisting in your currently compiled Nodelist,
     nor will you locate about 16 others in the same Net which have been
     added in the last year or so. Not much you can do when there is no
     uplink to send nodelist segments.  Yet 3-4 more months have gone by
     and nothing has changed.

     Recently reviewing the Malaysian Net, this segment is identical today
     to what I have on file back in February of this year, yet it was
     relayed by a Zone 3 sysop, somewhere around the same time, that the
     Malaysia NC was no longer running a Mailer and the Net no longer
     existed.  Any reason why this Net still appears in our Nodelist?

     To my chagrin, and almost a year after Net 163 took it upon themselves
     to provide a nodelisting to a sysop interested in being a part of
     Fidonet, subjecting themselves to Policy action, it would appear
     little has changed and it isn't for lack of active members in that
     Zone trying. Just this week, yet another sysop in Zone 6 (this time
     Indonesia) has put out a call for help and has provided the usual
     non-response as the reason why.

     Need another raft!

     Though it's a remote possibility, my concern does not lie with nodes
     elsewhere potentially CRASH mailing a down node l/d, or even the mere
     nodelisting of inactive grunt nodes.

     What should be of concern to everyone is that there are sysops running
     viable boards who are not appropriately accounted for in our Network.
     Anyone interested in routing mail to these network members can't.
     Sysops who would like to be a part of Zone 6 Fidonet are ill-served by
     our inaccurate "address book" and are not likely to join our
     FIDONEWS 15-39               Page 11                  28 Sep 1998


     organization after following protocol and trying to directly connect
     with several long distance *C's, to no avail.  In other words we, as a
     Network, are doing our best to discourage sysops from becoming a
     members of Fidonet.

     In early August, a Sysop posted that a prospective node I had
     previously communicated with had sent mail to RC15 (Zone 1) to apply
     for an RIN nodelisting, as his geographic area was not covered by any
     existing Net.  Since it had only been 2 weeks, and summer to boot,
     I wrote back to the sysop and said to give it another week and offered
     my assistance. Also made a note of this communication.

     At the end of the month, I reviewed my notes, checked the nodelist,
     saw the prospective sysop was not there, and mailed him.  He had heard
     nothing from anyone about his application, but expressed he was still
     interested in joining Fidonet.

     I'm intentionally leaving out some details from this point on but,
     suffice it to say, despite the efforts of myself and my RC, the window
     of opportunity to get this sysop a node number when it was most
     convenient for him, and not an unresponsive member of Fidonet, has
     passed.  Commitments outside of this network, which weren't an issue a
     month or even a 2 weeks ago, now are.  Whether that changes in the
     future is anyone's guess.

     The days are long gone where Fidonet had the luxury of turning away
     interested sysops.  The problems which prevented this sysop from
     getting a "properly" assigned node number were not addressed in time
     because of that chain around our collective necks otherwise known as
     the Geographic Boundaries clause.

     In another time and place, geographic assignment made alot of sense.
     In working Nets, Regions and Zones, it still does, per routed mail and
     enhancement of local online communities.  But if a Net, Region or Zone
     is known not to be working, the boundary clause serves as a nothing
     but a deterrent to any prospective node who can't get a reply, and as
     an ongoing threat, in the form of a PC, to any Coordinator who would
     do the needful and assign a node number.

     My question to our International Coordinator is when will Coordinators
     be permitted to assign out of area node numbers in non-response
     situations, and quickly, to encourage the growth of our network,
     without being subjected to complaint action?

     The Ship's got plenty of room for the rafters.  Let's get them
     aboard and share it!

     As Fidonetters know, the week of 14 Sep 1998 thru 20 Sep 98 was
     supposed to mark "International BBS Week," a promotional event to
     highlight the BBS community.

     So what happened last week? Absolutely nothing. International BBS
     Week was a dead duck. Even the participants in its Fido newsgroup
     FIDONEWS 15-39               Page 12                  28 Sep 1998


     didn't mention it.

     International BBS Week was suggested nearly two years ago by a group
     of New Zealand sysops, and was later touted by some sysops in the
     Minneapolis area.  But although those sysops talked a good game,
     their failure to organize in any meaningful way meant that
     International BBS Week was doomed from the start. Nary a peep has
     been heard from COCA, ICON, or any other group that claims to
     promote BBS sysops. None exercised any leadership to make
     International BBS Week meaningful and the event fizzled out like a
     wet firecracker.

     Meanwhile, the number of BBS systems continues to drop sharply.

     The idea of having an International BBS Week is good. It should be
     discussed during the October 2-4 SysCon'98 conference in Las Vegas,
     and BBS sysops should band together to plan a meaningful
     international event in the near future, perhaps within the next 90
     days. If we continue to do nothing, the BBS community will continue
     to shrivel and die.

     So, these questions as we move forward:

     1. Are BBS systems relevant anymore in a Webbed world? If so, what
     is their role? If not, why not?

     2. Since the term "BBS" has become burdensome baggage, is there a
     better term we can use to describe these systems?

     3. Where does the low-budget BBS computer hobbyist fit into an
     online world that is dominated by deep-pocketed Web players?

     4. What technical and content issues prevent BBS systems from being
     a viable alternative online destination and how do we address them?

     5. What is the most effective way to promote BBS systems in the
     future?

     Our time is short. Your ideas and comments, please.

                            Zone Echomail Coordinator Duties

     In an article last week related to the upcoming ZEC election, I had
     touched on the duties of this office.  A more definitive listing was
     posted in Z1_ELECTION last year by the then-elected ZEC, Bob Kohl.
     This is presented here in it's entirety for your information.

     Recent feedback from some of the REC's is that the sysops in their
     region do not want a sysop-level election.  As far as I know, only
     FIDONEWS 15-39               Page 13                  28 Sep 1998


     Region 13 still supports this concept.  Though the Regional Echo
     Coordinator's Council has not made any official announcement yet, the
     REC's posting in the echo ZEC seem to favor selection of the ZEC by
     the RECC.

     I'll continue to submit information related to the selection of the
     ZEC to Fidonews.  Even if the one-time practice of electing the ZEC
     at the sysop level is rescinded, sysops may still attempt to make
     their opinion known through their Regional Echo Coordinator.

     Feel free to crosspost at will:

     At the pleasure of the Z1C, the duties for the Z1EC shall be:


     1) Coordination between the Z1 echomail distribution systems

     2) Coordination of the RECC and with the Zone 1 RECs.

     The ZEC is the chairperson of the RECC.  He or she shall bring ideas
     to the RECC and moderate the discussion of ideas. He or she shall also
     act as a tie breaker in the event of a tie vote. The RECC may overturn
     a ZEC proposed action or idea with a 2/3rds vote of the RECC.

     If the RECC concludes that the ZEC is not active, ineffective in his
     or her job or not taking care his or her responsibilities per this
     list;  they may take a vote of no-confidence. If the vote of no-
     confidence passes with 2/3rds majority, the RECC will refer this issue
     to the Z1C for mediation or action as the Z1C sees fit.

     The ZEC shall be allowed to take issue with RECs that are not
     participating or doing their job, by taking the matter up with with
     the host RC of the REC's region and the Z1C for mediation or action.

     These two actions shall NOT be taken lightly without all due
     consideration of possible extenuating circumstances.

     3) Coordination with the other ZECs.

     4) Central repository of information for the various Z1 distribution
        systems.

     5) Mediation of Zone 1 echomail issues/disputes.

     6) Upper level mediation between Moderators, Fidonet distribution

        systems on related echomail issues.

     7) Coordination with the Echolist Keeper.

     8) Help in the formation and implementation of a Zone/Fido-wide
        Echomail policy. The ZEC shall work in conjunction with the RECC
        on this issue, so that the REC's can take this information to their
        respective regions for feedback.

     9) Term(s) of no more than 2 years.  No limit on number of terms

     10) Codify, with the RECC, the procedure for future ZEC elections.
         All future elections are subject to review by the Z1C..

     11) Provide for an interim Z1EC, should anything happen to currently
         seated Z1EC to prevent him/her from fulfilling these duties. The
         single duty of the interim Z1EC shall be to expedite an election
         and the smooth transition to the next Z1EC. The interim ZEC

                            Finding Your Lost REC

     Your Regional Echo Coordinator has been trying to find you.  He's been
     charged with the mission of finding out how you would like to select a
     new Zone Echo Coordinator to coordinate the Council of REC's (RECC).
     If you've missed his call in your own regional echos, and you don't
     know how to find him in the nodelist... and if you're interested in
     offering your opinion... then this list may help.

     To netmail your REC, all you need is his node number.  To find that
     on the list below, you need to know your NET number.  That's the part
     of your node number between the ":" and the "/".  Once you've
     determined your NET number, then find your REC in the list below.
     Netmail him with your opinion.

     If you're node number indicates that you're in a single-digit net,
     then you're a zone independant and should already know everything :)
     FIDONEWS 15-39               Page 15                  28 Sep 1998


     If you're node number indicates that you're in a two-digit net, then
     you're a regional independant and can just select from the second
     column of the list.

     If you're in nets 100 to 199, abandon all hope of finding the
     information from this list.  Those net numbers are spread between
     regions indiscriminately - you'll have to examine the full nodelist
     to determine your region.

     If your net number is anywhere between 400 and 999, you're not in
     Zone 1 and don't have to worry about this selection.  Similiarly for
     net numbers above 4000.  If your net number is between 1000 and 1999,
     you probably don't exist.
