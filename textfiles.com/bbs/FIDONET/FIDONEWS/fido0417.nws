                              What's in a Net?

     We've  grown  some  in  the  last couple of years.  Like anything
     else,  we've had our growing pains,  but by and large we seem  to
     have  developed a pretty stable structure.  The very fact of that
     growth also means that we have many sysops and  users  out  there
     who  weren't  here a couple of years ago and didn't see what lead
     up to the way things are now.  So it's probably a  good  idea  to
     take a look at where we are, how we got here, and why.

     First  there  was  nothing.  Then  there  was something.  Then it
     grew,  and now it's big.  End of history lesson.  I'm not in  the
     mood to lecture on the History of  FidoNet  right  now.  Besides,
     it's  been  done  already.  I  just  want  to ramble a bit on The
     Meaning of FidoNet and the Answer to the Ultimate Question.  (The
     Answer to the Ultimate Question,  by the way,  is "Pin 16 and pin
     18." Does anybody happen to know what The Ultimate Question is?)

     But the pins remind me of  what  started  me  on  this.  I  spent
     entirely  too  much  money lately on a town and county map of the
     U.S.,  drawn to a scale of about fifty  miles  to  the  inch  and
     mounted  on foamcore.  I then spent entirely too much time on the
     totally futile endeavor of sticking little  color-coded  pins  in
     that  map based on the latest node list.  Ironically,  I finished
     up Thursday night,  just in time for Ben Baker  to  make  my  map
     obsolete.  Well, at least it might be close for awhile.

     It   was  an  educational  experience.   I  discovered  something
     significant.  At least,  I think it's significant.  This  network
     is STRANGE.  Let me give you some examples:

     1) San Francisco has not one,  not two,  but THREE separate nets.
        They don't cover separate  parts  of  town  --  they  are  all
        intertwined.

     2) The  Pittsburgh  net has a hub that includes nodes as far away
        as Arkansas and California.

     3) There is a node in Wisconsin that has TWO net hosts closer  to
        him  than his own,  and his net consists solely of himself and
        his host.

     4) Dallas and Fort Worth each have their own net (they are  right
        next  to  each other).  Each net includes several nodes in the
        other city.  Meanwhile, Austin has a net that includes several
        nodes in both Dallas and Fort Worth.

     5) There are four states with no nodes at all.  No,  Alaska isn't
        one  of  them.  I  guess it's understandable.  One is Montana,
        and there really isn't any Montana.  It was  blown  up  in  an
        atom bomb test forty years ago,  and the government is keeping
        it a secret.  One is Nevada, and there isn't anybody in Nevada

        besides tourists at the casinos.  One is  West  Virginia,  and
        there  ARE  people in West Virginia,  but they're all starving
        coal miners who can't afford computers.  I don't remember what
        the  other state was offhand,  and I'm nowhere near the map at
        the moment (see how handy that map is?)

     I could go on and on,  but I think you get  the  point.  Why  has
     FidoNet  grown  so  many  quirks?  I  think  it's at least partly
     because  many  people  hold  differing views of just what FidoNet
     really is.  Since I'm the one typing at the moment, you'll get my
     own answer.

     FidoNet is first and foremost a mail system.  It serves  a  great
     many special interests,  but it does not exist to support any one
     of them.  And by specifically supporting none  of  them,  it  can
     better  serve  all  of  them.  An  example of this is the idea of
     "special interest nets." We tried that with net 900 for the  PCjr
     crowd.  It  didn't  work  out  too  well.  It  was  too  hard  to
     coordinate,  leading to  all  sorts  of  difficulties  ultimately
     resulting  in  poorer mail service,  which helps no one and harms
     everyone.  FidoNet itself is a technical operation,  and must  be
     managed on a technical basis for technical reasons if it is going
     to  properly  support  the  purely technical goals of keeping the
     mail flowing.  Once we handle the technical problems of  routing,
     node   list   maintenance  and  distribution,   mail  throughput,
     international links,  and so forth,  then and ONLY  then  can  we
     address  how  to USE the network in support of special interests.
     Please note,  I am NOT saying that we should ignore  the  special
     interest  groups.  I'm  only  saying  that we have to address the
     technical issues first.

     One mechanism that was developed to  support  the  free  flow  of
     ideas  and  information  was  that  of  the local network.  Local
     networks are intended to increase mail throughput,  lower  costs,
     distribute  node  list maintenance,  and that's all.  Some people
     have started thinking of local nets as being more important  than
     FidoNet  itself.  But  FidoNet does not exist for the convenience
     of the local nets.  Rather,  local nets exist for the convenience
     of  the  sysops.  Not  the sysops who are in the local net,  mind
     you, but sysops who are NOT in the local net.

     Here is the point of local nets in a nutshell:  If I want to send
     messages  to  three different nodes in Washington DC,  it is more
     convenient and cheaper for me to place one call than  three.  For
     that reason,  net 109 exists.  There is one other reason as well.
     It is very inconvenient and costly for me to try to send mail  to
     a node in Washington DC if he's gone off the air.  So net 109 has
     a  guy  there  who  is  in charge of making sure that the list of
     nodes in net 109 is correct.  I'm in net 107,  but net  107  does
     not  exist  for my convenience.  It exists for yours,  so you can
     reach me cheaper and can be sure that I'm really here.

     I  suspect  that  in the rush and hassle of day-to-day operation,
     many people have lost sight of that.

                             The Big Blue Disk

     I'm sure by now you've seen the ads for the Big  Blue  Disk  that
     keep  showing  up  in FidoNews.  It's sort of a magazine,  except
     that it's published on floppy disk instead  of  paper.  Well,  if
     FidoNews  can  call itself a newsletter,  then I suppose Big Blue
     Disk can call itself a magazine.

     I recently acquired a copy of issue #6 and checked it  out.  It's
     actually  quite  impressive.  It  came  in  a slick clear plastic
     package with some snazzy artwork on the "cover".  Inside I  found
     an  order  form  for  subscriptions  and back issues,  two floppy
     disks, and a card giving directions. ("Place disk #1 in drive A:,
     type 'GO',  and hit enter."  Even I could  manage  it.)  It  only
     works on an IBM or clone, as everything is done through their own
     menu system.  The disks by  the  way  were  black,  not  blue.  A
     couple  of  letters  to  the editor commented on that,  but color
     disks are still expensive enough that I can easily understand not
     using them for a monthly publication.

     Some  nice graphics.  Nice?  Seems inadequate.  They come up with
     new stuff like this every month?  How in the world do they manage
     THAT?  The instructions say it'll work on  a  monochrome  adapter
     and  in  your  choice  of 40 or 80 column width,  but I confess I
     didn't put them to the test.  I assume the  snazzy  graphics  and
     color  would  be  lost on a monochrome.  The whole system is very
     slick and has some cute touches.  For example, when you're at the
     end of an article and hit PgDn,  the entire screen jiggles up and
     down  a  couple of times,  as if it's trying to pull up more text
     but getting stuck and tugging the frame.

     Enough of the mechanics.  What  really  counts  is  the  content,
     right?  Right!  And  Big  Blue Disk has plenty.  Issue #6 was the
     April edition, and contained an interesting April Fool's section;
     a satire of the Big Blue Disk!  It was sort  of  a  mini-magazine
     within the magazine,  with some totally bizarre features that you
     have to see to believe.  In addition there were some  interesting
     and  informative news and opinion columns,  and several programs.
     Each program is accessed by a submenu that gives you  the  option
     to read the docs,  run the program, or copy the program onto your
     own disk.

     Not everything is a winner,  of course.  They had  an  "attribute
     selection program" that was pretty trivial by anyone's standards,
     plus a version of MV that I've seen done better.

     But  the  real winner in my opinion will surprise you.  I know it
     surprised me.  Of  all  things,  Kalah  by  Brian  Seitz.  That's
     right,  the  game Brian advertised right here in FidoNews for the
     better part of  a  year.  Guess  what,  gang  --  it's  GOOD!  My
     apologies for ever doubting you, Brian.  Your game is better than
     I  would  have  ever  imagined.  I  killed  most  of an afternoon
     FidoNews 4-17                Page 4                    4 May 1987


     learning  to  beat  the thing at level one.  I'm almost afraid to
     find out what the other three levels are like.  I won't  describe
     the game, or you'll think I'm nuts.  To hear the rules, it sounds
     like  the  dumbest  game ever invented.  But play it once,  maybe
     twice, and you'll get hooked.

     From the ads I've seen I gather that the Big Blue Disk often  has
     some  amazing  things on it.  I think their special this month is
     PC File,  and in the past they've offered PC Write.  What else do
     they have in store?  I don't know, but I'm sure of one thing: The
     Big Blue Disk is a Big Blue Winner.

                       Arc Utility v.s. Pkarc Utility

     The two utilities were tested on a disk containing 15 files  with
     an  average  file length of 19119 bytes.  The total for all files
     were 286785 bytes.

     These tests were run on an IBM PC with 640k of RAM and running at
     4.77 Mhz clock speed. The files were stored on a 360k floppy disk
     and archived to a fresh directory on  a  Miniscribe  20  megabyte
     hard drive.

     The  floppy  disk  was  diagnosed  and  condensed (un-fragmented)
     before the tests were run to  be  sure  of  file  integrity.  All
     events  were  run  3  times  and  the  average  of  the 3 runs is
     displayed here as the result.

     you?  (You'd probably be surprised at the diversity of opinion on
     that one!)  We've recently been discussing:

     * Equal Rights / Civil Rights      * Whether or not (fe)male
     * The "Cinderella Syndrome"          strippers are exploited
     * Surrogate motherhood             * Inequality (real and/or per-

                         Calling all IFNA jokesters

         I suppose most of you have been  reading  the  tripe  passing
     through  the  SYSOP  Echo  conference the last few weeks.  If you
     don't read it, you haven't missed much.  Mostly there are insults
     that make the war room on your local C-NET look tame.

         However,  there  have been some very good non-insulting jokes
     passing around.  For example, Ken S.  made a passing remark about
     not  receiving  his Official IFNA Membership Card.  Thom posted a
     list of IFNA cardholder benefits that had me rolling. Things like
     "Be able to cash checks up to $1,000,000 at any A&P," and "Use of
     the Space Shuttle for one mission per year."

         After the first message appeared  concerning  IFNA's  printed
     Nodelist, I posted a message saying:

         "Actually,  the  ad  contained  a  typo.  In reality they are
     selling official IFNA toilet paper,  with you choice of  Nodelist
     or Policy pattern."

         After I received a few replies on that one, I had an idea for
     the  Canonical  Collection of IFNA Jokes.  Know a good FidoNet or
     IFNA joke?  Have a copy of someone's hilarious post?  Send it  to
     me.  I'm  going  to  compile them all,  and release the collected
     file. I'll probably send it to FidoNews too.

         If anyone has the post of Thom's about cardholder's benefits,
     I'ld really like that one too.  I remember printing it  out,  but
     can't find the paper. That's going at the top of the collection.

         So,  send  you IFNA jokes to me at Phalse Opus,  107/35.  And
     maybe we'll even find out how many Fido Sysops it takes to  screw
     in a lightbulb!

                            A Review of PC-Desk

     I am driven to write this review of PC-Desk for two reasons.  The
     first is that I use it,  and  I  don't  use  just  anything.  The
     second  is  that  it  has  been reviewed so negatively by so many
     different reviewers, which runs so contrary to my experience.

     So lets start by talking about why I use it, and accidently about
     what it is.  PC-Desk keeps files of addresses, phone numbers, and
     assorted other data.  You say,  "Oh how  everyday!  Sidekick  and
     Dbase  II  can  do that!" And so they can,  but PC-Desk can write
     letters too.  And insert today's date.  And insert the address of
     the person to whom you are writing during  printing.  And  insert
     the form of address you chose when creating this person's record,
     as long as it begins with "Dear" (could be "Sir", "Gail", or even
     "Reverend  Dr.  Smith").  And  it  can print the entire list OR a
     particular subset of them up as an address list,  or just a phone
     list, or on mailing labels, or on rolodex cards.  And it can dial
     the  phone  numbers  included,  using a choice of two per record.
     And it can do form letters,  and even insert one  variable,  like
     the amount they owe you, plus reusing their name freely.  AND, it
     will print envelopes with your return address and their address.

     And if the above weren't enough,  it will create a whole bunch of
     identical  labels,  let  you  use  a printing tape calculator (on
     screen or actually using  the  printer),  keep  your  appointment
     calendar,  and if you like,  do it resident, so you can use other
     software.

     Now,  from personal experience,  I know of no word-processor that
     will  do  all  of that without an external database program.  And
     there  exist  separate  programs  to  do  things   like   address
     envelopes, and make rolodex cards and so on.  The problem is that
     one either has to make several copies of the entire list by  hand
     in these separate programs,  or run 3 or 4 residents together, or
     spend one's entire  life  converting  from  one  file  format  to
     another, which I garantee is a headache.

     And if that weren't enough,  telephone support is very good, from
     the author himself.

     So why don't the reviewers like it?

     It has menus.  True,  on one of them it'll use single letters  to
     invoke commands,  on another it'll use numbers,  and on the word-
     processing module,  it uses function keys.  To invoke the  pop-up
     calculator it uses ALT-C, and the same for other popups.  And ESC
     will  get  you out of almost anything,  even when it isn't on the
     menu.  So the superficial reviewer will get caught  up  in  these
     cosmetic flaws and miss the fact that the program WORKS.

     Also,  I've  seen it compared to desk accesory programs,  mailing
     list programs,  and even word processors.  The feature comparison
     kills  PC-Desk,  because  it isn't really any of those,  but does
     some of all of them.  The 300 line limit on the word-processor is
     enough  for any letter I write normally -- longer ones are really
     small novels and  deserve  the  attention  of  a  dedicated  word
     processor.  The  200  record  limit  per  file  doesn't put it in
     competition with dBase III in the data base world,  but its  more
     than  I  want  in  any  ONE  file  (I  keep separate files for my
     business,  my square dance group,  my wife's  business,  computer
     vendors etc.).

     In  other  words,  it  does  it all,  it doesn't require that you
     retype everything all the time, and it works.  I know of no other
     program which does all that.  If you want to write a novel, or do
     mass mailings, you'll want something else. If you want a place to
     keep your small businesses actual customers,  file  all  of  your
     repair and support numbers and addresses,  print simple invoices,
     keep your address book AND print it out, you'll want PC-Desk.

                       FNEWSPRN -- A FidoNews Utility


       If you're like me,  you look forward eagerly to the next  issue
     of  FidoNews.  It's  always full of interesting articles,  notes,
     suggestions,  announcements,  or  whatever.   It  adds  an  extra
     'flavor' that so many non-FidoNet BBS's lack.

       The  biggest  problem  I've been having has been reading it.  I
     never seem to have the time to sit down and  browse  through  it,
     and  printing  it  all out seems to be an enormous waste of paper
     when all that I want is one or two articles.  So, to alleviate my
     problems, I've written a utility program that I call FNEWSPRN.  I
     wrote  it in Microsoft BASIC on the WANG APC,  because that's the
     computer that's on my desk  at  work.  I  tried  to  make  it  as
     'structured' as I could,  and as generic as possible,  so that it
     would be easy to work with and also run on many  different  types
     of microcomputers.

       The  program  allows you to see what FidoNews issues are in the
     current directory,  view an individual  one,  or  print  selected
     pages.  It  doesn't use any special graphics.  It does run slower
     than I would like, even when compiled,  if it's running on a 4.77
     Mhz PC.  On faster machines, it runs at an acceptable speed.

       I've  been  told  that FNEWSPRN needs to be improved.  I agree,
     but the lack of time that  prompted  me  to  finally  write  this
     utility  keeps  me from making the effort immediately.  The major
     things will have to be,  1) A way  to  handle  archived  FidoNews
     issues;  and  2)  An on-line interface for use as a BBS "Outside"
     function.

       There has been some EchoTalk as to where and to  whom  FidoNews
     'belongs.' As far as I am concerned, its current IFNA sponsorship
     is  fine with me,  as the current Editor seems to be doing a fine
     job.   My  FNEWSPRN  utility  is  my  effort  at  supporting  the
     magazine.  Please feel free to distribute it,  and to make copies
     available to BBS callers for use on their machines.

       FNEWSPRN is not an official  IFNA  utility.  Instead,  per  the
     Editor's suggestion,  it is released to the public domain for the
     benefit of all.  If you like it,  thank IFNA.  If you don't  like
     it, write your own version and send me a copy.

       You can file request FNEWSPRN.BAS, 14,980 bytes;  FNEWSPRN.EXE,
     59,658  bytes;  or  FNEWSPRN.ARC,  6,351  bytes,  from  my  node,
     142/216.  The  .BAS  file  is  in  ASCII  format.  The  .ARC file
     contains only the BASIC file;  crunching on  the  .EXE  file  was
     minimal.  Or,  you can log on and download any of these directly.
     Enjoy it!

     Steve Townsley
     Opus / SEAdog 510/17
     CCITT V21,V23,V22,V22bis

                          A Word About Standards


     This  is  the first time I have written and article for  FidoNews
     although  in England I will write around 3000 words every  couple
     of  weeks  or  so. The main problem is not the  material,  it  is
     rather  the  problem  of  incompatibilty  which  prevents  us  in
     Europe getting our message to you in the States.

     For  many  of you reading this sending an article to FidoNews  is
     a  simple  affair,  file  attach to 1/1 at 2400  using  your  USR
     modem  or  "real" Hayes. The FCC cares very little as to  whether
     your  modem is a Taiwanise Hayes clone, runs CCITT tones or  BELL
     103/212a.

     Over  in the UK things are very different. Firstly, in order  not
     to  receive  a visit from the authorities I have to use  a  modem
     which  has  gone  through a series of approval  tests.  Secondly,
     few  of these modems use BELL tones. Thirdly, all must adhere  to
     the  recommedations  of the CCITT. Fourthly, approval is a  long,
     complicated and expensive process for all modem manufacturers.

     Converting  into  dollars, the cheapest useable,  approved  modem
     which  could  be  described  as Hayes is  the  WS4000.  It  costs
     around  $300  and  will  auto-answer  at V21  or  V23.  It  is  a
     variation  of  Hayes  1200 as it will auto-answer at 300  bps  or
     1200/75, but mail can only be done at 300 bps (V21).

     The  V23  standard  is a popular in Europe  because  of  Viewdata
     services,  where  it  is a standard speed,  and  for  downloading
     over  crummy  phone lines, of which there are many. A  V23  modem
     can  be  picked-up for $10 by anyone. So for the user of  systems
     in  Europe a V23 modem is the cheapest way into comms. The  75bps
     channel  allows the user to type in messages at typing speed  and
     the 1200 bps channel allows cheap downloading.

     The  crunch  for  UK  Sysops  is that  providing  access  to  V23
     callers means eiher spending $600 on a modem with V22 as well (to
     talk  to the States), or buying a $300 Hayes and sending mail  at
     300 bps. Hayes modems in the Uk which use V21/23 are 1200 bps for
     our users but only 300 bps for Sysops.

     Obviously  we  should  buy  modems  that  use  V21,V23  and  V22.

     However  now you are lokking at prices of around $600 dollars.  A
     real  "Hayes"  1200/1200 modem costs around $750.  Moreover,  the
     real  "Hayes"  does not use V21 or V23, and combined  modems  use
     the  CCITT recommendations on V22. Yes, the tones are  compatible
     with  Bell 212a but, V22 modems will often wait for a V25  answer
     tone  before  sending any data. So the UK sysop, even if he  buys
     a  V22  modem  still  may  not be able to send  data  to  the  US
     because   a  BELL  212a  modem  does  not  send  an  answer  tone
     FidoNews 4-17                Page 12                   4 May 1987


     compatible with the CCITT V25 recommendation.

     Perhaps  we  should  buy a V22bis modem. Well  prices  in  Europe
     start  at  around $1100 dollars although the Dowty  Quattro  with
     such things as BELL 212a compatiblity comes in at just $1300.

     Remember  we  still have to offer V23 to our callers whose modems
     change hands for around $10.

     However,  let  me suppose that we in Europe suddenly  solved  all
     the  problems  of the modems, our next problem would  be  getting
     the  modems  to  send  CONNECT  1200  everytime  a  CONNECT  1275
     happened because both Fido and Opus don't understand about V23.

     SEAdog  (Version  4.0) solves the problem by accepting 1275 as  a
     proper connect message.

     Let  me  assume that  the IFNA Committees insist  that  all  Fido
     compatible  software must accept CONNECT 1275 as a valid 1200 bps
     message,  not  unreasonable since it is merely an  ASCII  string.
     The  problems  of  Europe  would still not  be  totally  over  as
     currently  we are fast loosing our position in the nodelist.  The
     1200  node  limit  of Fido is most accutely a problem  in  Europe
     and  Austrailia.  If you cannot mail someone without  an  address
     and  you cannot keep the addresses of all nodes in the system  we
     will  add just one one more problem into the cumulative  problems
     of international links that we had from day one.

     As  we  run Opus, the other week, in an effort to find  out  more
     about  aspects  of these problems, I logged onto the Dallas  Opus
     Help  BB  run by David Finster. In a sense I was pleased to  read
     the  questions YOU, the US Sysops, are now asking about 9600  bps
     modems. For, in your own way, you are now experiencing first hand
     the  frustration  of non-standards that have plagued Europe  from
     day one of running Fido.

     European  BBS's,  and  other  suppliers  of  data  services,  are
     governed  by the international standards of the CCITT. Non of  us
     really  like  the idea that we cannot use BELL tones,  or  cannot
     just  plug a USR 2400 bps straight online legally. We don't  like
     the  idea that we cannot participate fully in net  activity until
     we can communicate at a common standard.

     I  would  now argue that with the growth of nets outside  the  US
     and  the  large number of systems that need to use the  standards
     imposed  by  the  CCITT  that the net should  have  a  policy  on
     standards.

     Up  until  now  it has been the cry of Europe, unable  to  afford
     the  high  price of approved CCITT equipment, that has wanted  an
     agreed   standard.  I  would  argue  that  "standards" is  now  a
     net-wide  issue.  If US Sysops are to go 9600 bps, and they  have
     an influence on how modems are to be designed, they should insist
     that  modems  are capable of communicating at  CCITT  recommended
     data  rates  as  well  as  BELL or  one  manufacturer's  own  new
     standard.
     FidoNews 4-17                Page 13                   4 May 1987


     Many  US  Sysops  must have noticed that more and  more  European
     BBS's are now  offering  2400  bps.  Little  by  little  European
     manufacturers are offering some compatability with US BELL tones.

     It  has taken the best part of two years to get UK  manufacturers
     to  adopt  the Hayes standard. Only some offer BELL tones.  There
     should  be  no reason why a modem cannot listen to a phone  line,
     determine  whether an incoming call corresponds to BELL or  CCITT
     standards  and  answer  with the correct tone. We in  Europe  are
     constantly  campaigning for such a modem. Whilst debating the use
     of  9600  bps,  all of you in the US should demand a  modem  that
     talks  to  the  world and not just Joe Public in the  next  town!

     The  moral of this tale... Europe has suffered because the  CCITT
     standards  are  not universal. In the next speed jump to 9600  we
     must  adopt  a  standard that can be approved for  connection  to
     the  phone  line in any country in the world. This may mean  that
     that  whatever  modem is choosen it must use CCITT tones  or  yet
     again we could face years of incompatibility.

     From:Jean Coppola
     Fido 107/201

     Several new Fido utilities have been  released  for  Fido  Sysops
     this week.

     The  first is FILESBBS.EXE and is distributed in an Arc file that
     has been named FILESBBS.ARC.

     This simple utility is run in any directory and it will create  a
     sorted  FILES.BBS  file  for  you.  It  will allow you to enter a
     description for each file in  the  directory.  The  program  will
     then  prompt  you  for  a description to be placed in the DIR.BBS
     file which it will then create.  This is good for  systems  which
     have downloads from floppys and are changed regularly.  Run it on
     each floppy and you have created both  files  in  one  shot.  The
     version  is  3.2 and is available on Fido 107/201 as well as some
     other boards around the area.

     The second utility is called QUESTION.EXE and is in an  Arc  file
     that has been named QUESTION.ARC.

     This  utility can be run either under OUTSIDE or OUTER and allows
     the sysop to create up to 25 different sets of questions for  the
     caller to answer.

     While  still in it's infant stages QUESTION.EXE works and will be
     developed further if there is enough  interest  from  other  Fido
     Sysops.  Again this is available from 107/201 and from some other
     systems around the area.

     OUTSIDE is  available  from  107/211.  OUTER  is  available  from
     151/104 or many other systems.

     Hello FIDO sysop's.

     Why,  I did write this memo is,  that a lot of sysop's don't
     know how FIDO treats the modem control lines and which Hayes
     AT-command's  he  send  over the dataline in  the  different
     states of FIDO itself.  For some of you,  this is  wellknown
     information,  but  some not.  For those it can be a help for
     problem solving.  Also this kind of search for truth on  the
     modemlines never ends,  as it can be changed with each FIDO-
     version.  So  this is a start document.  If anyone has  more
     information please tell me.
     The FIDO version I used, was 11-W.

     The  lines  were observed with a datascope device,  but  can
     also  be done with a terminal which translates  the  control
     char.  into readable characters.  You must have for this two
     COM-ports,  from  which you use both RXD-entries.  One  RXD-
     entrie is connected with the TXD-line.  Most  datascopes can
     handle  only one speed at the time,  I used 2400 baud and as
     such did use a ROUTE.B file with two defined nodes,  one  at
     300  and one at 2400 Baud.  As line observer I used a  small
     BREAKBOX, which did display the V24-lines.

     1. The FIDO_IBM program and the modem.

     The  FIDO_IBM program was started up with some parameters as
     2400/N 11/J 128/V 5/S 1/G only. So the commandline was:
                FIDO_IBM 2400/N 11/J 128/V 5/S 1/G
     As FIDO starts up,  he talks towards the modem with a  speed
     defined with the /J and /N parameters. As there are a lot of
     combinations, I did only observe the 300, 600, 1200 and 2400
     for /N and 1/J (Hayes) and 11/J (Hayes 2400).
      The  speed  is  300 Baud for all 1/J params  (xxxx/N  don't
     care) and for 11/J with 300/N only.
     The speed is 2400 Baud for 11/J with 600,  1200,  or  2400/N
     param's.  Hang on, during mailing other speeds are used. The
     speed used at log-off are the same as log-on.  As FIDO comes
     with  the  "Initialise modem",  towards the modem first  the
     DTR-line  is set true (pin 20) and than the  fixed  internal
     AT-commands  are  forwarded  and if a  FIDOMDM.BBS  file  is
     present  these are send after the internal ones.  So you can
     override  the  default  FIDO  settings.  The  default  modem
     commands FIDO sends always,  are dependent on the /J  switch
     and well:
       (I use here _ for the real x'0D'=carriage return).
     For 1/J
                _AT_ATV0Q0E0S0=1M0X1_ <contents FIDOMDM.BBS>

                As said on 300 baud.

     For  2/J,   3/J,  4/J  and  8/J  noting  is  send  over  the
     modemlines,  so  it seems Fido controls it via seperate I/O-
     addresses.

     FIDO is not reacting on the verbal return of the modem,  but
     is looking forward to the CARRIER line from the  modem.  The
     relation  between the internal DCD (carrier) and the D25 pin
     can be set with the /V param.
     For the true IBMPC's it means as example:
     Pin  8  (DCD)  for 128/J or pin 5 (CTS) for 16/J  or  no  /J
     param.
     So if the DCD becomes true,  due to the fact,  the modem did
     establishe  a connection, the FIDO starts really up to serve
     the  caller.  Now there are 3 ways FIDO is  terminating  the
     session:
     1. If the DCD becomes false, because the modem terminates.
     2.  FIDO terminates,  because the caller  is terminating the
     session in an ordery way.
     3. The user didn't react within x minutes (from the x/S)
     All  three  cause only a DTR set shortly FALSE on which  the
     modem must reply with DCD is false. If this happens correct,
     the  FIDO  starts up again and gives _AT_ only  towards  the
     modem at a speed according to the speed as it was during the
     last connection with the modem.  If however, the modem keeps
     the DCD true, and FIDO raises its DTR again to true the FIDO
     reacts   with   another   trial   via   the    HAYES-command
     (silence)+++(silence)_ATH0_. On this, the modem has to react
     with DCD is false otherwise FIDO starts screaming which only
     can set quit with ^C. So also a late DCD=false don't help.
     Fido  don't look to the Highspeed modem control line (pin 12
     or 23) as set by the HAYES modems. Even it don't look to the
     result  codes  given  by the modem at the  time  a  call  is
     incoming.  So  in sequence after the bell rings,  the  modem
     sends  2  (ring)  and after the modem detects a  carrier  it
     sends 1,5 or 10 (=CONNECT 300,1200 or 2400). FIDO looks only
     to  the  DCD  line and if raised true,  it  detects  on  the
     firstcoming  character  (space or CR),  on which  speed  the
     modem circuit is working. That is basically all FIDO does in
     FidoNews 4-17                Page 17                   4 May 1987


     normal FIDO-mode.

     The FIDONET-mode is more street forward. At mailtime in fact
     nothing happens exept that depending on the speed as defined
     in  the NODELIST.BBS for the node as given in  the  ROUT.tag
     file,  the  FIDO forwards with that speed the dialcommand to
     the  modem.  So it is expected that the modem establishes  a
     connection  at  this speed with the called  modem.  On  this
     point  a lot of clones are non compatible.  This however  if
     you  actually have POLL or SEND statements in your  ROUT.tag
     file.  If  you  have e.g.  only  RECV-ONLY,  really  nothing
     happens towards the modem.  If you have a command into  your
     ROUTE.tag, which results in a DIAL-action, this dial-command
     is for all modes:
                ATDT<number>_
     T   (touch)   or   P   (pulse),   FIDO   only   serves   the
     T(ouch)  mode.  It  has to deal with  your  local  telephone
     company only,  and if you unlucky are connected with an  old
     Telephone equipment (there are still a lot),  the only thing
     you   can  do  is  with  DEBUG  find  the  ATDT  string   in
     FIDO_IBM and change it into ATDP.

     Depending  on the return code (numbers and no verbal  text),
     FIDONET goes on or dials another number. Very important with
     HAYES  modems is,  the modem returns the result code at  the
     speed  of  the  ATDT  command.  Even if  a  lower  speed  is
     detected,  which  can happen with V22(bis).  The true  HAYES
     modem  only  changes  its speed towards the FIDO  after  the
     result code is send.  Once got a connection with the  called
     node, the x/G switch is decreased. So if your x/G switch (in
     FIDO_IBM) is 1/G,  after one connection per each node,  this
     node  will  not  be  dialled  again.   Even,  if  after  the
     connection  something  is  going  wrong.  If  all  nodes  as
     specified  in  the ROUTE.tag file are dialled with 1.5 to  2
     sec.  intervall  (It  is a little random,  and not  done  in
     SEND_ONLY) and no connection is found, the FIDONET continous
     dialling.  However,  sometimes  he  is doing  it  twice  and
     sometimes upto 10 times a night.  So suppose  you  have  two
     nodes into your ROUTE.tag to POLL,  and at the first attempt
     both have a connection, than for the rest of the mailtime no
     actual dial will be done.  Of course if an incomming call is
     detected  (POLL/  SEND by another fido),  this  is  handled.
     After  a connection in MAIL-time FIDO's send always  verbal,
     also  to  each  other,  to  call  back  later,  because  its
     mailtime.   However   NON-fidomailers  if  calling  will  be
     accepted, but as they send no Tsync, they are thrown off the
     line. A real mailing FIDO (calling party) wait's for the end
     of the above mentioned message and reacts with a Tsync  code
     (x'AE')  towards the called FIDO. This called FIDO sends now
     a  C  (I  think from connect) if he is  in  mail  mode.  Now
     actually  the  mail is exchanged.  If no mail connection  is
     established the calling FIDO after a short time reacts  with
     making  its  DTR  line  false,  after  which  the  modem  is
     disconnected.  Immediatly  FIDO raises the DTR and goes in a
     random  time-out (ca.  1.9 sec.),  before calling  the  next
     number.  During  this  time  an  incoming  mailcall  can  be
     FidoNews 4-17                Page 18                   4 May 1987


     handled.
     One  thing is very clear,  the both fido modems have to find
     out,  who is originator and who is answering.  This  because
     otherwise  they can not make a connection.  The only way  to
     fix this,  is that a HAYES modem,  which get a dial-command,
     automatically goes into originate mode and dials. Note, that
     before  FIDONET started,  the both modems where in answering
     mode and FIDO did NOT change that. It sounds logical, but if
     it is done by all HAYES-compatibles, You know??.
     If the modem reacts after a dialup with a busy, no dial tone
     or  even  no sign of live (silence) code,  the  message  "NO
     CONNECT" is given. This even with an ATX4-command mode,
     If a connect code is given,  the FIDONET starts to test  the
     other side on mailing mode etc.  Here The same happens as in
     normal session mode. So the FIDO can terminate and the other
     side or the DCE-connection can end the session.

     2. Some thoughs about this all.

     With the Hayes modems, a lot is described, but also a lot is
     not.  This  has  nothing  to do with the  "defacto  standard
     Hayes",  but is true for each Specification.  The three main
     areas of problems are:
     - the not described commands,
     - the speed selection or the scanning pattern,
     - the speed conversion.
     The not described commands are for some not a surprise,  but
     for others it is. Take for example the commands as forwarded
     to the modem as decribed above in part 1.
     The AT with V0,  Q0,  E0, S0=1, M0, X4 and &W where known to
     me.  but  AT&D2  and AT&C1 I didn't  known.  Even  with  the
     ROBOTICS-2400  manual,   its  not  described  and  also  not
     available.  This till I got an original HAYES-2400 handbook.
     With this last book in hand I realised, that every clone had
     more  or less followed the HAYES till HAYES-1200 and did  go
     there way, more or less functually compatible. But Hayes did
     go  further  with the 2400 version.  So not to confuse  this
     documents with all that new stuff, another file is available
     called HAYES1.ART

     As given before the standard settings of FIDO are:
     For 1/J
                _AT_ATV0Q0E0S0=1M0X1_ <contents FIDOMDM.BBS>
     For 11/J
                _AT_ATV0Q0E0S0=1M0X4&D2&C1&W_ <FIDOMDM.BBS>
     At the end of a session: (silence)+++(silence)_ATH0_
     Not  to  copy  the modem book,  but shortly to  explain  the
     commands:
     _AT    Requests the modem to return the OK sign or code 0.
            FIDO neglects the return as ATV0 is not set.
     _ATV0  Result code set to figures (stead words).
     The next commands are in one AT string,  but has to be  seen
     if        _AT was preceding it.
     _ATQ0  Result codes visible.
     _ATE0  Echo off.
     _ATS0=1 Set number of rings to 1, before hook off.
     FidoNews 4-17                Page 19                   4 May 1987


     _ATM0  Set speaker off.
     _ATX1  Set extended result code set (codes 0-4).
     _ATX4  Set  extended  set with  wait for dial tone and  full
            set of 10 result codes.
     _AT&D2 Set modem in 108/2 mode.
     _AT&C1 Set Carrier Detect on carrier detected.
     _AT&W  Write settings as tempory factory settings.
     (silence)+++(silence) Gets modem into command mode. Hello, I
     have  changed my modem into another escapemode,  so it  will
     not work on my FIDO.
     _ATH0  Hook on. (Disconnect modem from line).

     On all above commands FIDO neglects the return  code,  which
     is only given after the RETURN in the command string.

     What me make a little nervous,  What is my modem doiing,  if
     it  gets an _ATX4_ if my modem only has X1 and X2.  If he is
     neglecting  X4,  than my previous set X2 is kept.  My  modem
     neclects &C1,  but The &W was executed.  That is clever,  So
     for security I am not using 11/J,  but still 1/J.  As one of
     my modems, the Kingfisher knows the _ATX4_command, I did put
     this  in  my own FIDOMDM.BBS This gives a much  better  dial
     process,  as dialtones,  engaged signal, etc. The DATAD-1024
     has only till X2, so I need different FIDOMDM.BBS files.

     One  thing  in FIDO needs in my opinion  an  upgrade.  If  a
     connection is not established, FIDO gives always NO CONNECT.
     This  is  basically  true,  but more  information  would  be
     welcome  in  the  MAILER1.LOG.  This while most  modems  are
     giving a detailed result code,  from which I good detect  if
     my local Tel.  company is overloaded, giving me no dial tone
     or  the  other  side is to busy always or  that  connections
     between  telephone  districts  are too  busy.  It  gives  me
     arguments towards the Tel.  company. This will not help, but
     I can push them with real facts.

          Welcome back,  this week  hasn't been as hectic at work so I
     was able to spend some time  trying out  a few  new things  on my
     system. A  lot of the time was spent trying out my new video card
     on a lot of "old" software, and in the process I discovered a few
     things.  I'm  still  looking  for  someone  in  the  area who has
     WordPerfect so I can try it  out, but  in the  meantime Microsoft
     Word is  performing quite  well. Monday  night there  was a local
     sysops meeting (not just  FidoNet  people,  it  was  open  to all
     sysops regardless  of BBS software) and that helped get me out of
     the depression I mentioned  last  week  (from  reading  the Sysop
     echomail conference).

     -- even more MSC 4.0 and now MASM 4.0 --

          In  the  first  of  these  columns  I went over the neat new
     compiler I had just bought, Microsoft's latest version of C. From
     time to time I've gone back and mentioned it, and last week I had
     another chance to "test" its capabilities. A program  came across
     Usenet that  is supposedly  (I haven't  had a  chance to actually
     test it out yet) a uucp (Unix to  Unix copy  program) program for
     PCs. I  am somewhat  interested in this as uucp is what Unix uses
     to talk to other machines. In  any case  there were  two parts to
     the program;  one was  in C,  and the  other part was in assembly
     language.  While  the  C  part  compiled  with  no  problems, the
     assembly language  part was  a problem  because I  didn't have an
     assembler. Since  I am  interested in  software like  this I went
     down  and  bought  Microsoft's  Macro Assembler (list price $150,
     version 4.0) from my local dealer  (the C  compiler had  a rebate
     card worth  $25 which  made it a little less painful). Armed with
     this,  I  quickly  assembled  the  second  part  and  linked  the
     programs. I  looked over  the docs  on the assembler and it looks
     nice, although  to be  honest I  don't know  assembly language. I
     suppose I  should learn  it, and  with some of the new columns in
     FidoNews I will probably make the  effort. If  the program works,
     we should  be seeing  some more  Usenet stuff in FidoNet. I don't
     think we'll ever have  a PC  running a  full Usenet  however, I'm
     told they  usually process  2 meg of mail every day! What it will
     do is expand the horizons of telecommunications by making our PCs
     more versatile.  After I've  had a chance to try out the software
     I'll let you know how it works out and where to obtain it.

     -- ATI's EGA Wonder (list price $399.00) --

          I finally got my new video card this week and it seems to be
     working well.  I had a few problems with the installation, but it
     didn't take to long to get it up and running.  The EGA  Wonder is
     kind of  a swiss  army knife of video cards. It supports hardware
     compatibility with the IBM CGA and  EGA video  cards and hardware
     compatibility with the Hercules monographics card. In addition to
     supporting these standards it  has it's  own 132  column mode and
     they include  a driver  for Lotus 1-2-3 that gives you 132 column
     by 44 rows. While you can find a  few other  cards that  do this,
     what the  other cards  can't do  is give  you any  of these video
     modes  on  any  monitor.  No  matter  what  type  of  monitor you
     currently have,  it will run software for any video card (on that
     same monitor). This means that  even  if  you  have  an  EGA only
     FidoNews 4-17                Page 21                   4 May 1987


     monitor or  a TTL monochrome monitor you can run CGA software (or
     Hercules software) or run  EGA software  on your  CGA monitor. If
     this  still  isn't  enough  to  satisfy  you, the EGA Wonder will
     switch between many of  the video  mode automatically.  If you've
     got it  set as a color EGA and start to run some CGA software, it
     will automatically switch itself  into the  CGA mode  where it is
     completely compatible  with a "real" CGA video card. There's only
     one catch  on the  auto-switching, it  won't automatically switch
     between color and monochrome modes. If you've got the card set to
     come up as a CGA card (or color  EGA mode),  you've got  to run a
     program to  make the  card act like a Hercules monographics card.
     This isn't too difficult, and the program they provide can be run
     from  menus  or  directly  from  DOS  ("SMS  M80"  to make it the
     monochrome mode).

          I did have a few problems installing the card, but they were
     both resolved  fairly quickly.  The first one is the card insists
     on having interrupt level 2 to itself. I had another card set for
     that interrupt level and couldn't figure out what was wrong until
     I looked at the  Diagnostics and  Troubleshooting section  of the
     manual. In there it specifically states that "The EGA Wonder will
     not co-exist with another  device that  uses interrupt  level 2."
     This wasn't  a problem as I just needed to change a jumper on the
     multi-function board. The other problem was primarily my fault as
     well. The  card was  designed to work with IBM monitors and while
     this wouldn't usually present  any  problems,  it  did  present a
     problem for  me. In the same section as the interrupt information
     they say that on some  compatible  monitors  a  horizontal and/or
     vertical  hold  control  may  be  needed.  My problem was that my
     monitor (a  Samsung SM-12SF,  amber TTL  monochrome) doesn't have
     either of  these controls on the outside. When I went into any of
     the color graphics (not text) modes  the screen  rolled up. First
     thing I  did was panic! Next I called up my dealer and asked what
     other monitors he could  get in  quickly. After  he mentioned the
     lines he  could get  in less  than 24  hours, I called up ATI and
     asked if the EGA Wonder had been tested with either of the ones I
     had  chosen  (an  Amdek  310A,  monochrome TTL, or the Amdek 722,
     color EGA). They were able to tell me instantly as  they use both
     of those  monitors. Since  I didn't  really need a new monitor, I
     took one last look at the Samsung monitor (which I have been very
     pleased  with)  and  found  a  notation  that  the  vertical  and
     horizontal hold controls were inside the monitor. I  quickly took
     the case  off the monitor and located the controls. In a few more
     minutes I had everything hooked back up (with  the monitor's case
     off) and  was able  to adjust  the horizontal  hold to the proper
     setting, which is to say the  picture didn't  roll in  any of the
     video modes.  Put everything  back together,  and it works like a
     charm. I may still end up getting an EGA monitor,  but there's no
     hurry as I can get to get all the video modes (granted, in shades
     of amber/orange). Lesson learned is that I will never buy another
     monitor  without   EXTERNAL  hold   controls.  While  I  wouldn't
     recommend this procedure to everyone, it  did work.  If you don't
     have any  external hold  controls on your monitor, I hope you got
     everything from a good  dealer as  he should  be able  to perform
     this minor surgery for you. I know mine would be willing to do it
     free for anyone who bought their  system from  him, the  card and
     FidoNews 4-17                Page 22                   4 May 1987


     monitor, and possibly even someone who just got the card as well.
     If you've  gotten  everything  mail  order  and  don't  feel like
     opening up  your equipment,  be prepared  to spend  some bucks if
     this turns out to be necessary.

          I've  currently  got  the  card  set  up  to  come  up  as a
     monochrome  graphics  card.  This  was  necessary  as  some of my
     software tries to use colors when possible, and I didn't like the
     way it  looked on  my monochrome  monitor. I  probably could have
     changed most of the software,  but  didn't  think  it  was really
     necessary. When  I want to run one of those stupid copy protected
     programs that you boot off of, I run the "LOADGAME"  program that
     ATI  provides  with  the  EGA  Wonder.  It  would  be nice if the
     software manufacturers would accept the fact  that all  of us are
     not pirates, and that not everyone has a CGA card and monitor. In
     a way I almost regret (after all, I do get  a lot  of neat things
     with  the  card)  that  I  needed  this  card  to run a lot of my
     software. Too many authors  seem  to  think  that  no  one  has a
     Hercules monographics  card or  an EGA  card, and end up shutting
     themselves out of good  sized  (in  my  opinion)  portion  of the
     market.  A  Hercules  compatible  monographics  card  and  a  TTL
     monochrome monitor are usually a lot cheaper than a CGA  card and
     a  RGB  monitor  (approx.  $250  vs.  $450).  Compliments  go  to
     Electronic Arts for not  only not  copy protecting  most of their
     programs (no need for the loadgame program) and for supporting us
     Hercules monographics board users  out here,  well... former Herc
     card user.

          Since I am seriously considering buying an EGA monitor (some
     programs just doesn't look right in shades of orange), I'm glad I
     still have  an old  monochrome text  board lying  around. You can
     have a dual display  system with  either a  MDA board (monochrome
     text),  or  a  CGA  card.  I  can still have Microsoft's Codeview
     debugger "running" the  program  on  the  EGA  Wonder/EGA monitor
     combination  while  tracing  the  program  on the monochrome text
     board/monitor. For you Fortran people, Microsoft is now including
     Codeview (and  support for  it) in their new Fortran compiler. If
     you've never heard of  Codeview,  look  at  some  back  issues of
     FidoNews for my more complete review.

     -- Winding down... --

          I  think  the  Top  Gun  overdose  has  finally  worn off. I
     succeeded in testing the "bug" in JET and found it doesn't exist.
     The only  way to  get the re-arm menu up is to have the gear down
     and be on the ground  when  you  go  through  the  hanger.  As an
     alternative to JET, I looked at F-15 Strike Eagle from MicroProse
     (list price $34.95) and  came  away  a  little  disappointed. The
     people at  MicroProse don't  seem to  realize what  a joystick is
     like on an IBM. Even though we have a real  joystick, F-15 treats
     it  as  an  8  position  switch.  MicroProse would have done much
     better to take advantage of the capabilities of  each machine for
     which  they  make  F-15,  rather  than  doing  a extremely strict
     translation between the different versions. One thing I did enjoy
     was that  in F-15 the enemy planes actually engage you for aerial
     combat, in JET they  seem to  just shoot  missiles like  crazy. I

     suppose  I'd   actually  enjoy  a  "flight  simulator"  that  had
     dogfights like F-15, while having the top-notch controls  of JET.
     If anyone knows of such a program, please let me know about it. I
     would be very interested in such a program (hmm...maybe I'm still
     under the effects of that "overdose").

          In my ever continuing quest to learn more about WordPerfect,
     I've come across a book that explains a lot about it. The book is
     "WordPerfect Tips  and Tricks"  by Alan  R. Neibauer (Sybex Inc.,
     $18.95). While it is not as good as  "Using WordPerfect"  for the
     beginner, it does have a lot in it for the more advanced user. My
     only regret is that I don't have WordPerfect yet. The  book seems
     to be made for people who like to sit down and try out new ideas,
     this includes hacker type people like me. I  would have  liked to
     try some  of the  shortcuts and  macros they present, but it will
     have to wait until I can afford to buy a copy of WordPerfect. The
     book doesn't  cover much of the basics, and is aimed primarily at
     the power  user, or  someone who  is interested  in expanding his
     knowledge of WordPerfect. I found it to be very well written, and
     it answered many of the questions I had about WordPerfect.

          That ties up the column for this week. I'd like to hear your
     comments on  anything I've  written about, or something you think
     should  be  investigated.  Down  below,  you'll  find  me FidoNet
     net/node number,  my Usenet  address, and  my US mail address. If
     you're a user of BBS trying to send me netmail, please mention to
     your  sysop  that  netmail  to  me  must be routed through either
     157/0, 157/1, or 157/502; he will know what you mean. If you're a
     sysop who  is trying  to reach me, just take note of the previous
     sentence. All of these nodes are running SEAdog, so you shouldn't
     have to  worry to much about mail schedules. They are all capable
     of forwarding a file to me, and are willing to do it as well.

     =================================================================

     Ben Baker, 1/0 and 100/76

                           A Call for Volunteers

     Someone put a  truly  excellent  idea  into  one  of  the  echoes
     recently.  I  wish  I  had saved the message -- I don't even know
     who entered it, but whoever you are, I want to thank you.

     The concept of "HELP nodes" worked pretty well for a  while,  but
     each help node is operated independently, and it is easy to let a
     request  slip  through the cracks.  Even worse,  there are now so
     many help nodes it is difficult for a neophyte to determine  just
     where to turn.

     I  think  it  is  time  to   replace   this   system   with   the
     "clearinghouse" concept that has worked well in the past for Fido
     bug  reports.  I would like to establish two nodes as INFORMATION
     East and INFORMATION West.  These nodes would be the focal  point
     for  ALL  requests  for  information  on  ANY  topic.  The Sysops
     running these nodes would NOT need to be experts on all,  or even
     any  particular  subjects.  But  they  would have to know who and
     where  the  experts  are.  And  they  would  need  to  be  fairly
     organized individuals because they would need to record and track
     inquires,  forward  them to appropriate people,  do follow-ups to
     insure no inquiry gets lost,  and keep each other informed.  They
     would  probably  build a stock-pile of "standard answers" in text
     file form to answer the  most  frequent  questions  directly.  In
     short, they would become the net's information traffic managers.

     So  I'm looking for volunteers.  Here are a set of qualifications
     I think are necessary to the job:

     1. Must be well organized. (I think I just disqualified myself.)

     2. Not already burdened with a lot of other activities or respon-
        sibilities.  I suspect this will turn out to be a BIG job.

     3. Diplomacy  is  a  must.  They  must  be able to work well with
        novice questioners and the techies with the answers alike.

     4. Some technical competence,  while not essential,  is certainly
        desirable.  There  are very few software tools to help in this
        task, and some will probably need to be developed.

     If you are tired of sitting on the sidelines and  would  like  to
     get involved in FidoNet operations in a very real sense,  send me
     net mail detailing your qualifications.  I  would  like  to  make
     selections  for  the  two positions in time that the listings may
     appear in NODELIST.135, so please don't delay.
