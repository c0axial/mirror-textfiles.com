                      Twas The Byte Before Computing
                              by Bert Happel
                   (with apologies  to Clement C. Moore)

     Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house
     Not a circuit was working not even in my mouse;
     The files were all loaded on the hard disc with care,
     In hopes that the FAT would list them as there.
     The backups were nestled all snug in their sleeves,
     To keep the bytes from dropping off them like leaves;
     And the disc drive was quiet, taking a rest
     Just waiting to run the next boot-up test.
     When out of the speaker there arose such a clatter
     I sprang to my desk to see what was the matter.
     Away to the keyboard I flew like a flash,
     Threw open the drive-door and heard a loud crash.
     The lights on the breast of the new-fallen dust
     Gave a luster of mid-day to a CRT covered with crust.
     When what to my wondering eyes did appear,
     But a miniature sleigh and the eight data registers I fear.
     With a little old driver, so lively and gloss
     I knew in a moment he was a master of DOS.
     More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,
     And he whistled out and called them by name
     "Now Fido!  Now Opus!  Now QuickBBS and TBBS!
     On, ConfMail!  On, XlatList!  On, Bark and WaZoo!
     To the top of the memory!  To the top of the stack!
     Now dash away!  Dash away!  Dash away all!"
     As leaves before the wild hurricane fly,
     When they meet with an obstacle mount to the sky,
     So up on the screen the coursers they flew,
     With a sleigh full of utilities, and DOS commands too.
     As I drew back my head and was turning around,
     Out the RS-232 port he came with a bound.
     He was dressed all in ROM, from his head to his foot,
     And his clothes were all tarnished with bytes and some soot;
     A bundle of data he had flung on his back,
     And he looked like he had a program he wanted to crack.
     His eyes -- How they twinkled!  His dimples, how merry!
     His cheeks were like roses, his nose was a cherry!
     His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,
     And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow;
     The stump of a pipe he held in his teeth,
     And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath;
     He had a broad face and a round little belly
     That shook when he laughed like a bowl full of jelly.
     He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,
     And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;
     A flash of the CRT and a twist of his head
     Soon gave me to know I had lost programs to dread;
     He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
     FidoNews 5-51                Page 2                   19 Dec 1988


     And filled all the RAM; then turned, the big jerk,
     And laying a finger aside of his nose,
     And giving a nod, in the RS-232 port he goes.
     He sprang to the sleigh, his team they all whistled,
     And away they all flew like they had sat on a thistle.
     But I heard him exclaim, ere he faded out of sight,
     "Bug-free programs to all and to all a good night!"


     Best wishes for the Holidays to everyone.

                 RegComm - Communications From RegCon.

     Recently one of the nodes within FidoNet was excommunicated twice
     within a very  short period of  time.  In  both cases there  were
     definite  policy  violations,  there  was  more  than  sufficient
     warning given before action was taken and everything was done  by
     agreement between the RC and  NC involved.  Sounds like  a pretty
     simple case history, but nothing ever is.

     The  node  filed  an  appeal  to  the second excommunication, and
     during the appeal process the RC became quite ill.  As there  had
     been some delay  in the appeal  process prior to  the illness the
     ZC, in all  fairness, requested the  NC reinstate the  node until
     the appeal could be completed.  The NC refused the request.   The
     ZC restated the request a  little more strongly and the  NC again
     refused the request.  The ZC was forced to change the request  to
     an order.   (Keep  in mind  that at  ANY time  the ZC  could have
     removed the node  himself!)  The  order was ignored  and when the
     nodediff was sent in by this  NC it was accompanied by a  message
     that the change had still not taken place.  Now with regret,  but
     little choice, the ZC had to remove the NC from the nodelist  and
     because there was now no NC for the net the entire net was placed
     on hold.

     Our present policy was followed to the letter.  Evidently the  NC
     in question  did not  understand the  management structure within
     FidoNet and  thought, with  the RC  responsible incapacitated  by
     illness, there was no management.   The ZC, well aware  of every-
     thing that  had transpired  and feeling  that there  could be  no
     success in the appeal of the node STILL followed due process  and
     asked  for  reinstatement  until  policy  could be followed.  But
     failure to recognize the  management chain resulted in  an entire
     net being placed in limbo.

     We all need  to realize there  is a management  chain within this
     network.  That chain  starts at the IC/ZC  level and ends at  the
     node level.   Oh,  yes, the  node is  a part  of management.  The
     management of one's own node is an important part of net  manage-
     ment as an error in software implementation at the node level can
     impact the local net, the region and even the entire network.  As
     in  any  organization,  there  is  a  need  for management within
     FidoNet and  the *C  structure IS  that management.   Failure  to
     follow the requests of  management within FidoNet will  result in
     the  same  actions  you  might  expect  for failure to follow the
     requests of management in any business or organization.

     Now that our regional management team has improved their communi-
     cations you  can expect  to see  actions taking  place much  more
     quickly than  in the  past.   We will  do all  we can  to enforce
     present policy while  we continue to  work towards updating  that
     policy to better address the  problems created by a network  that
     is expanding at the rapid rate that FidoNet is demonstrating.
     FidoNews 5-51                Page 4                   19 Dec 1988


     We don't ask you to follow blindly, as in any management team  we
     still have the infamous `middle management' and we have  managers
     who have had little  training.  All the  problems of the *C  team
     and all  problems we  will constantly  be addressing.   We do ask
     that you communicate with management, let us know problems as you
     perceive  them  and  give  us  the  opportunity  to  act  on your
     requests.    But  please  do  not  make our job more difficult by
     failing to recognize the requests  of the management team, as  to
     do so leaves that team little  choice as to the course of  action
     it must follow.

     ("RegComm" will be a weekly column in FidoNews and your  comments
     are  welcome.  Please  address  your  concerns  and  comments via
     NetMail to your Net  or Regional Coordinator, you  should receive
     an answer within a few days. It's your net and we are in need  of
     your input in order for us to fairly represent you.)

     Don Daniels

                  Request for Members of IFNA Committees

     Three of IFNA's Committees are presently in need of additional
     volunteers.  There is need for both workers and leaders.  If
     interested, review the material below and, if you are prepared to
     take on part of the effort described, please send a message to
     Don Daniels at 1:107/210.

     Nominations and Election Committee - IFNA BYLAW 34: "The
       Nomination and Elections Committee shall be responsible for:
         a) finding and qualifying candidates;
         b) reviewing voting procedures and recommending modifications
            as necessary;
         c) performs other duties as described in applicable By-Laws."

       As indicated, this committee runs and oversees the entire
       election process.  It has various tasks to do between now and
       FidoCon relative to the election.  The Chairman will present
       the election results to the BoD at FidoCon.

     Bylaws and Rules Committee - BYLAW 35:  "The By-Laws and Rules
       Committee shall be responsible for review and any suggestion
       of changes to these by-laws."

       There still is a fair amount of work that needs to be done to
       bring our by-laws into shape.  Also, it can be expected that
       the current by-laws election may produce a few inconsistencies
       which will require revisions, and changes in IFNA's direction
       may also have to be provided for.  If you can write well and
       have a feel for how things should be, this might be for you.
       Most of the committee's work will have to be done before
       mid-June.

     Security and Individual Rights - This is a new committee, in the
       process of being formed at this time.  It will be concerned
       with any and all matters related to security and to privacy.
       As many conflicts between individuals typically occur when
       their respective individual rights come in conflict, this
       committee will look at such areas and provide guidelines as
       they deem best.  Work on this committee could continue
       throughout the year, but there are concerns related to the
       Security and Privacy Committee of the Electronic Mail
       Association which this committee will need to address prior to
       meetings Feb 28 - Mar 1 in Scottsdale AZ and in late June in
       San Francisco.

     Sorry that we can't promise fame, wealth or glory - just work
     towards the common good!  Again, if interested in helping, please
