     =================================================================
                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================

     In Doug's last editorial, he was pretty specific in his description
     of the British monarchy with respect to the FidoNet structure. It
     was apparent to me that he was attempting to create an avenue for
     the development of a method to emancipate the "commoners", (read
     that sysops), from the battered deformed confines Policy 4.07. He
     went on to suggest a "constitutional monarchy with an elected House
     of Commons in charge".

     This general specification and base plan may have real merit. It
     could be the embryo for the future of FidoNet. Properly nourished
     by the many sharp minds in Fido, a healthy rebirth of Policy can
     be achieved to redefine Policy, and deliver a working platform.
     It must be a document as simple as the rungs of a ladder to read.
     One glance at any ladder tells the whole story. Anyone knows at
     once that it has a narrow specific way to get to the top of it.
     They also know that it will have to "fit" within the area of use.

     With that in mind, build a new document, rung by rung... step by
     step... to specify the "elected House of Commons" as Doug put it.
     The present officers being "grandfathered", (factored) in the plan.
     I personally like, "International_WWW.Fidonet" for a name. Let me
     hear what YOU think, please, that I may modify the ideas presented
     thus far. Bear in mind this is only a discussion of Policy 4.07.

                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Ruth Argust has been very ill and just recovered enough to email me:
     Hi Warren,

     I have been in bed for about two weeks with a horrid case of the flu
     and not able to even get near the computer. I heard about Doug's death
     only a couple days ago and am still reeling from the shock.

     There are very few really NICE people in Fido who are nice all the
     time. Doug was incredible, always even tempered, always cordial,
     always ready with a one-liner. I adored him and his death has hit me
     harder than anyone will ever know.

     I realize that I am too late to assist you but at least one person out
     there (aside from Gerry) will know how deeply I am mourning the loss
     of this wonderful spirit.

     Ruth

                     President Lincoln Declaration
     President Abraham Lincoln declared Thanksgiving Day an Annual Holiday
     to be celebrated the last Thursday in November. The tradition begain
     in the fall of 1621 when William Bradford, governor of Plymouth,
     invited the neighboring village of Wanpanoag to join the pilgrams for
     a festival celebrating the bounty of the season. This is a gentle
     reminder that Thanksgiving is just around the corner.

           A SMILE costs nothing, but it creates much.
                     It enriches those who receive
                 without impoverishing those who give.
                        It happens in a flash,
             and the memory of it sometimes lasts forever.

         None are so rich that they can get along without it,
           and none are so poor but are richer for a smile.
                   It creates happiness in the home,
                    fosters goodwill in a business,
                  and is the countersign of friends.
                       It is rest to the weary,
                     daylight to the discouraged,
                         sunshine to the sad,
                and nature's best antidote for trouble.
           It cannot be bought, begged, borrowed or stolen,
        for it is something that is no earthly good to anybody
                        till it is given away.
                        And if it ever happens
       that some people should be too tired to give you a SMILE,
                      why not leave one of yours?
                   For nobody needs a SMILE so much
                 as those who have none left to give.
                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     FAQSEC- Security for Sysops        Dated: 6 OCT 2000

     Hello all!  Here is some general advice for setting up a more
     secure system. Much of it will be applicable to any BBS software
     so feel free to share the info about.

     To start with, my software is a _very_ secure system.  It has no
     backdoors or known security flaws in the current release.  What it
     does share with every other software, is the ability for the sysop
     to change the native settings in ways which may not be as safe as
     intended.

     1. Lets start with the archive conversion feature.  Unless you
     really need it, remove it.  There are external programs such as
     THDPRO which will scan for viruses and convert archives at the
     same time.  If you must keep it, you want to leave it set so only
     the SYSOP can convert archives on your system. Now that was easy
     eh?  The rest will be just as easy to do.

     2.  Sysop access level.  This is an area where you will be best off
     if devious.  Do you use the computer always at home?  If so, there
     is no need to allow non-local keyboard access with that account.
     If you set SYSOP access to local only keyboard, no one can gain
     that access unless sitting at your local keyboard.

             a.  Devious trick, dont use the main sysop account for
                 other than sysop functions.  Make a second account in
                 your real name, with handle if preferred, and set it
                 basically at normal validated levels.

     FIDONEWS 17-41               Page 6                    9 Oct 2000


             b.  Co-sysops and access levels.  Now there are extremely
                 reliable co-sysops and very good reasons for having
                 them.  I understand and most others do also, but the
                 new sysop does need to be aware the co-sysop access
                 can be a security problem.  When possible, this is
                 the secure way to go about it:

                1.  Dont have any unless you really NEED one.  IE:
                    Don't use it as a reward for being your 'best
                    buddy'.

                2.  If they live with you, or where the computer is,
                    set their access to require 'local keyboard only'
                    and it will prevent anyone from dialing in as them
                    and doing damage to your system.

                3.  Give them no more access than they *must* have to
                    do their job. If they only remotely login to handle
                    their messages, consider 2 accounts just like in
                    the sysop example above.

     3. Look to the WFC (waiting for caller) screen and note almost
     every sysop function is there in almost every software.  If you
     really want to drive someone crazy, remove the sysop menu access
     from all other menus.  If it just isnt there, it *cant* be used
     against you.

     4.  Passwords.  Encryption.  Use it.  This protects both you and
     your callers in the unlikely event someone manages to get ahold of
     your user information files.

             a.  Be aware of habits you may have developed as a sysop.
                 I can't stress enough the need to protect your system
                 passwords.  Don't accidently use them on another BBS.
                 While drafting this FAQ, one feedback from a beta site
                 was about how he knows the system passwords on most of
                 the systems in his net.  How?  Easy, the sysops forget
                 and try it out of habit on his system, get an error,
                 then use the one th chose for his BBS.  On some
                 softwares, this will leave your password sitting in
                 the other BBS's log file!

             b.  Don't use the same password in FD as you use on your
                 BBS if you also use FD as your terminal program.  If
                 you do, one day you may find when logging into another
                 BBS, it
                 sends your system password as it trys to 'autoconnect'.
                 (There are ways around this but beyond the scope of
                 this file.  See the FrontDoor documentation).

     6.  Keyboard remapping.  This is when via file or othermanner,
     someone manages to change your keyboard to say something like
     'del c: /u' when you press the F1 key (or whatever they chose to
     remap).  Dont allow it.  You have several choices of ANSI.SYS
     type replacement files which literally dont contain the keyboard
     remapping capabilities.  For regular DOS users, ZANSI.SYS works
     FIDONEWS 17-41               Page 7                    9 Oct 2000


     well for most.  It also takes up less memory than normal ANSI.SYS
     does.  DVANSI isfor Desqview users and works just as well.  Other
     common types are NNANSI and ANSI.COM.

             a.  ZANSI is the magic name at 1:275/100 for the Zansi
                 replacement file should you not find it locally.

     7.  Backups!  Security is also making sure you can put your system
     back together after a hardware failure.  Make them nightly if
     possible with a series of tapes or ZIP/JAZZ drive so that if one
     goes bad, you always have a slightly older one to go back to.
     If you have no tape backup, at the least backup your critical
     files such as the userlist information, to floppy.  If you have no
     tape backup but have plenty of extra drivespace, a less than
     perfect but better than nothing method, it is backup to another
     directory.  It is best if this is done to a separate drive.

     8.  Path statements.  Define the Protocol path (DSZ/GSZ etc) and
     the Archive Conversion path (PKZIP etc) with a full description
     such as C:\protocol and C:\converts.  Oh, and dont use those
     default names!  Neither one need be listed in the Path= statement
     found in your AUTOEXEC.BAT.

             a.  Should you find it awkward to not have your compression
             utilities on your DOS search path, there are several ways
             to deal with that.  I happen to use a little batch file to
             reset my path statement to include my compression utility
             directory.  I just have to remember to run the other batch
             file to set it back afterwards (or reboot).

             b.  Many sysops just list the conversion archives in the
             path but leave out the protocol directory.

             c.  Now and again you will encounter a door which requires
             one or the other be in your path.  Best to look about for
             another simular product without that need.  If you can't
             live without that door, be aware that it has slightly
             reduced your system security.

     9.  The most common method of breaching any BBS security is by
     taking advantage of flaws or oversights of third party programs
     (upload checkers, protocols etc). When installing third party
     utilities it's best to research the source to find out how
     secure the program is and what you can do to ensure it is set up
     securely. NEVER trust the author's claims. Instead, get
     independant reviews if possible and solicit opinions of other
     sysops. Often the best gauge of a utility's security is how widely
     used it is. But don't let this fool you (popular is not 'always'
     secure).

         a. When in doubt, ask the sysops in your area what they use
         and measures they take to ensure these utilities are secure.
         Most importantly ask more than one person since no one person
         knows all the quirks of third party utilities.

         b. This text does not endeavour to suggest that any particular
     FIDONEWS 17-41               Page 8                    9 Oct 2000


         utility is
         either secure or insecure. Claims of this nature which 'may'
         be accurate at this time could be in error and may not reflect
         future versions of the same programs.

         c.  When passing information to a door or utility, never pass
         it more than it absolutely needs to function.  'More is not
         better' in this case.

     10.  Some folks, just like to upload trojan programs.  A Trojan
     can best be defined as a program which does something other than
     what it looks like it's doing.  A famous one, looked like a flight

     Trojans do not infect other programs, but are damaging just the
     same. To prevent the spread of them, mark your uploads to a
     secure directory and do not autovalidate programs until you have
     tested them out. This protects you, your callers, and the fellow
     sysops in your area if they are downloaded before discovery and
     uploaded to another system.

     11.  Doors, revisted.  Don't assume because a caller sends you a
     program, and begs it be added, it's 'safe'.  Test it first.  Even
     if it looks like a common archive, obtaining the same one from a
     safe source for comparison is a good idea.

     Well all!  This has been a collective effort of many.  By this
     point, I have had inputs from many sites!  Special Kudos to:
     Lars Hellsten, Don Johnson, David Muir, and Kevin Watkins.  For
     inspiration, thank Scott Raymond of a long ago security package
     for earlier Telegard versions. Portions contain ideas from the
     June 1994 IceNET News article (Copywrite) by Ken Harris, WWIV

     One man's hobby was fishing, he spent all his weekends near the river
     or lake, paying no attention to weather. One Sunday, early in the
     morning, he went to the river, as usual. It was cold and raining, so
     he decided to return back to his house. He came in, went to his
     bedroom, undressed and laid near his wife.

     "What terrible weather today honey," he said to her.

     "Yes. And my idiot husband went fishing!"

     a @ preceding an individual's name implies a virtual email
     address. The email is translated as follows
     firstlast@osirusoft.com will automatically route to the
     appropriate individual's email.  Anyone in this list will
     also receive routed notice of this feature.  In my case, it
     would still be joejared@osirusoft.com, but you get the idea.

     Also, as information is provided to me, I will be adding a
     latency field to each node, which is defined as the maximum
     time between when the message is received, and when it is
     sent on to other nodes, or available to be sent onward,
     defined in minutes. A latency of ! implies that there is an
     immediate response, and an attempt to deliver immediately
     after processing, or a "MinuteMail System", as it were.
