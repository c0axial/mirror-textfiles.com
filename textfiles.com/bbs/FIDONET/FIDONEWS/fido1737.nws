                            Passing of a Superman
                                  Doug Myers

     In fiction, Clark Kent is the alter ego of the famous hero.  For
     many years, Fidonet has been graced with its own Kent... though this
     one never changed the course of mighty rivers nor bent steel in his
     bare hands.  In fact, Kent Anderson, though a superman to those who
     knew him, was not what one would consider a "power" in Fido:  he was
     never a Coordinator, never excommunicated anyone - in fact, I don't
     think he was ever in the nodelist, posting from a point node most of
     the time I communicated with him.

     But Kent was a superman where it counted to many of us who cherish
     the echoes of Fidonet.  Not only was he a prolific poster in the
     echoes he frequented, but he seemed to avoid the contentious style
     of posting that many of us fall into... and would even calm the
     storm if he were passing through such arguments.

     A man with this quality might seem a natural as an echo moderator,
     and that is a role Kent filled often and with distinction.  He is
     probably best remembered for his stewardship and participation in
     the MEMORIES echo, though who could forget his unifying effect when
     he took over the troubled echo MODERATOR?

     Kent Anderson was a moderator's moderator in more than just title,
     though.  Many of us remember his sage advice to other moderators,
     and his vision of the moderator as echo steward rather than boss.

     Kent passed away last Tuesday, September 5th at the age of 79.  His
     death was not unexpected, as he'd spent his last few months in a
     hospice, but he'll be missed by many.  It may be tempting to think
     of his death as a loss to Fido, but the truth is that Fidonet is
     forever richer for his influence.  Kent was a superman where it
     counted most!

                                REC13 Election
                         Carol Shenkenberger, 1:13/0

     The REC13 election has been concluded early due to only 1 candidate
     other than the current RC agreeing to run, and stipulating they
     would do so only with 2 other running mates.  There were no other
     running mates.

     The reason for this is because the current RC (me) is active duty
     military and going to transfer earlier than initially expected. This
     means an early RC election. With that news already regionally known,
     interest is high in who will become the RC and the desires of the
     net show a long turnover time is what is wanted, more than
     discussing who will be REC.

     To reduce turmoil, Carol Shenkenberger, RC13 will assume REC13
     duties on 15SEP00.

     Discussion will take place shortly in region 13 sysop echos, on who
     the possible candidates for RC13 will be. There have already been
     posts accepting to run for that position.

     More will be posted in FIDONEWS regarding R13 elections, in
     accordance with our internal regional policy as we progress to the
     next stage.

                              Standing the Watch
                             Carol Shenkenberger

     The Navy has a tradition.  It's called 'passing the watch' or
     'standing the watch'. It means we all stand to train our successor
     and when the time comes, we pass on 'the watch'.  When DavidM was so
     busy figuring out all the new things he needed to do as Z1C, I told
     him not to worry.  'I stand the watch'.

     I now stand the watch for DaveC and will do the traditional training
     of whomever the region selects to replace me.  To ensure that, DaveC
     and I are transitioning the one aspect over quickly which leaves
     some 5 *months* or more before a new RC here would take over, and
     still leave me some 2-4 months 'here' to assist them in any way
     needed after that date.

     A wise person sees a plan that is better than their own, and adopts
     it <G>.

     I do not know when we will start collecting candidates 'offically'
     but there's noting wrong in asking about it.  We already have one
     poor SOB on record as willing to try (evil grin) and from
     netmail/other I know of at least 2 possible candidates besides him.

     I ask only as we move o to the next phase to remember 2 things.

     1. You had no clue who I was or what I would be like when I was
     skyrocketed suddenly before your eyes to this.

     2.  The most important quality is CARING for your region enough to
     make extra effort to help.

     (Ok a 3rd, none of us have a choice in this.  I'm moving out of
     country 'someplace' and Sasebo Japan or Yokosuka are 99% sure to be
     the location.  So factor that in and wish me well while thinking
     over who will take care of you and 'stand the watch').

                                  Doug Myers

     A new revision of ARTSPEC.DOC is being distributed on the FIDONEWS
     echo.  A focus of this revision is to eliminate some of the
     technical considerations which are handled by the editor anyway in
     the hopes of making the submission process more tempting to
     prospective writers.  Coordinators and mail movers are encouraged to
     check and ensure that the normal distribution process has replaced
     older revisions of this document.

     =============

     FidoNews Article Submission (September 10, 2000)

     FidoNews, founded in early 1984, is the newsletter of the FidoNet
     computer network, for both its Sysops and users.  It is passed to
     its readers electronically via the FidoNet and other computer
     networks and to non-network readers as well as to the InterNet.
     Fidonews welcomes articles, editorials, and features of interest to
     the Fidonet Community.  To have your article included in Fidonews,
     simply send it via netmail to 1:270/720 or via internet email to
     DougM@paonline.com.

     In the past, this article submission document outlined the many
     technical details involved in processing Fidonews articles.  The
     assumption in the past seems to have been that articles would be
     automatically processed from the editor's inbound mail directly into
     Fidonews.  However, the current editor does no automatic inbound
     processing; rather, each article is examined before publication and
     technical details are handled by the editor rather than imposed on
     FIDONEWS 17-37               Page 4                   11 Sep 2000


     the person submitting the article.  It works better that way - it
     means that you are free to just concentrate on what you want to say.

     It's perfectly acceptable to simply write your article the same way
     you would write netmail or email.  Don't worry about the stuff added
     by software along the way... I edit that out anyway.  All I need at
     this end is a text message which I can read with standard software
     and which I can import into a standard text editor to format for the
     Fidonews software.  Alternatively, you can file attach an ASCII text
     copy of your article.

     Here are some guidelines you can use to help me make it easier to
     format your article for Fidonews:

     1.  Use standard ASCII text.  Most word processor formats can't be
     used by the Fidonews software.  In addition, the Fidonews software
     won't accept most ASCII control characters nor any characters above
     ASCII 127 (this, unfortunately, includes all those neat box drawing
     characters).

     2.  Start your lines at the left of your screen when typing.  The
     software puts in a left margin automatically, and I have to manually
     remove any left margin appearing in your document.

     3.  Keep your line length to under 70 columns for tables or charts
     (or if you include an ASCII illustration).  Regular paragraphs
     exceeding this 70 column limit can be reformatted during the editing
     process, but tables and charts are normally distorted beyond
     recognition by a simple reformatting.

     4.  Separate paragraphs with a blank line.  This is how my text
     editor recognizes paragraph endings, so I have to add blank lines
     manually if you don't.

     5.  Title your article as you'd like to see it in the Table of
     Contents.  If you don't, I'll make up a title for you, but I'd
     rather have the article appear as you wish.

     6.  Include your name and node number (or internet address) under
     the title.  I'll grab it from your message, if necessary... but,
     again, I'd rather have the article appear as you wish.

     7.  Check your own spelling and wording.  Though I feel free to
     reformat your article so it conforms to technical requirements, I
     generally leave the wording (and spelling) alone as I don't want to
     distort what you have to say.

     8.  Send your article before Sunday in order to see it in that
     Monday's edition.  Normally I put the newsletter together Sunday
     Evening and send it out... and I normally check email and netmail
     before I finalize the edition.  So if I get your article before
     Sunday evening, I'll include it... but send it by Saturday to be
     safe :)

     9.  If you're not sure whether you should write or send in your
     article, I would encourage you to send it anyway.  Chances are, if
     FIDONEWS 17-37               Page 5                   11 Sep 2000


     you write of something of interest to yourself, it'll be of interest
     to others.  Besides, Fidonews is a better publication when it's
     written by a variety of people :)

     Missing from this week's issue is the announcement about a Russion
     language book about Fidonet.  The announcement was sent to me
     earlier in the week, but was irretrievably damaged due to disk
     failure.  If the author will resend the announcement, I'll be happy
     to include it in the first weekly issue after receipt.  My apology
     for the inept handling of the original.

     a @ preceding an individual's name implies a virtual email
     address. The email is translated as follows
     firstlast@osirusoft.com will automatically route to the
     appropriate individual's email.  Anyone in this list will
     also receive routed notice of this feature.  In my case, it
     would still be joejared@osirusoft.com, but you get the idea.

     Also, as information is provided to me, I will be adding a
     latency field to each node, which is defined as the maximum
     time between when the message is received, and when it is
     sent on to other nodes, or available to be sent onward,
     defined in minutes. A latency of ! implies that there is an
     immediate response, and an attempt to deliver immediately
     after processing, or a "MinuteMail System", as it were.
