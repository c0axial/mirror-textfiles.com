        The contents of the articles  contained  here  are  not  our 
        responsibility,  nor  do  we  necessarily  agree  with them;

        received.  





                              Computer English

        We have a problem here.  A minor one, 'tis true, but a 
        problem all the same.  You see, normal English usage isn't 
        all that well adapted to bulletin board use.  

        Let me give you an example.  I have several users who run 
        their own bulletin boards.  On occasion (during chats and 
        such) one of them will invite me to call into his board.  I 
        generally agree by saying something like "Okay, I'll drop in 
        and visit you someday."  A few times this has gotten me a 
        reaction like "What?  You're going to drive over here?"  No, 
        I say, I mean I'll call it up and check it out.

        How can I tell someone "I'll be seeing you" when I'm not 
        going to be seeing him at all?  I'm just going to look for 
        messages from him.  So why not "I'll be reading you"?

        If I tell a user, "I'll talk to you later", isn't he going 
        to think I'm planning on phoning him and talking?  But that 
        isn't what I mean at all!  It's much more descriptive if I 
        tell him "I'll type to you later."

        If we extend this a little bit, we can come up with a whole 
        lexicon of computer usage.  "I'll be reading for you on 
        such-and-such board."  "I'm a bit finger-tied today."  
        "Please pardon how I read, I have a frog in my hands." 

        Now I realize that this takes a bit of getting used to, but 
        isn't it much better than trying to use conventional phrases 
        where they don't apply?  With very little practice you'll 
        soon find yourself easily typing things like "Gee, I haven't 
        typed to George in awhile.  I wonder where he's dialing?"

        What's the matter, cat got your fingers?

                         Response to Bruce Lomasky
                          by Ben Baker -- Fido 76

        I  read with some  concern Bruce Lomasky's  article in  last
        weeks  newsletter.   We  have not  had  a  lot  of  negative
        response  here in  St. Louis,  and I  hope he  represents  a
        minority.  

        Bruce,  I think you missed  the point when you  spoke of the
        "'improved'  Fido."   A  lot of  people weren't coordinating
        FidoNet,  only two were.  When we got to more than 200 nodes
        it became essential that we decentralize.  It had become too
        big  and  too  much work.  After all, Fido is a hobby for us
        too.

        The  network-region  concept  was not  intended to "improve"
        FidoNet,  although I think that will ultimately be a result.
        Instead,  it was the  mechanism needed to  allow 30 or  more
        "coordinators"  to have complete control over their piece of
        the pie without requiring a great deal of coordination.

        Now lets consider your concerns over routing.

        "1) The host is VERY! busy."  In the larger  networks,  this
        is  true.   But most  of the larger  networks are served  by
        both an inbound and an outbound host.  During  the  National
        net  window, the inbound host  is in a "receive-only"  mode.
        You  only need  compete with  other folks  calling the  same
        host,  not the host itself.  St. Louis is one of the busiest
        networks, and we get the mail in and out with few delays.  I
        recently  sent a message to  John Warren.  In less  than two
        hours,  that  message traveled  form  100/76 to  100/482  to
        100/10 to 100/51 to 102/36 to 102/470 to 102/31,  its  final
        destination.  A "many days" delay is almost always caused by
        a  node that doesn't  answer the phone,  or a host  with bad
        routing files.  We expect the latter problem  to  eventually
        disappear.

        "2)  There is no way to know if the mail got through."  True
        enough,  not  only  for FidoNet,  but  for  the U.S.  Postal
        Service as well.  I think FidoNet is at least  as  reliable,
        and in most cases both faster and cheaper!

        "3)  More phone calls  are generated /  evening."  Probably,
        but  during  the National  window  there are  actually FEWER
        calls   with  routing  because  many   calls  carry  several
        messages.  The other calls are during network collection and
        distribution periods occurring before and after the national
        window.  This reduces rather than increases congestion!

        If  you aren't served by  an outbound host and  if you NEVER
        send  more than one  message to an  area, you're  absolutely
        right, routing won't save you anything.  But it  won't  cost
        you anything either.  If you steadfastly insist  on  sending







FIDONEWS     --           08 Jul 85  00:00:40           Page 4

        any  or all  messages without  routing, there  is  a  simple
        answer.   Any message with a   nonexistent  file  "attached"
        will  go directly to its  destination, no muss, no  fuss, no
        bother.

        I heartily endorse the KISS principle.  What we have was the
        simplest  way to get where  we wanted to be.   It WAS broke!
        We fixed it!

        Typed in by:
        Robert E. Spivack
        SYSOP
        Fido #346 Region #10 (480) 972-8164

        Boca Raton,  FLA --  Micro-Systems  Software  Inc.  recently 
        began  shipping  a full-featrued,  electronic bulletin-board 
        software package that supports electronic mail,  as well  as 
        program  or  data-file exchanges for the IBM Corp.  Personal 
        Computer and compatible systems.  

        The program,  called BBS-PC,  is said to provide 16 separate 
        sub-boards;   four  different  file-transfer  protocols  for 
        uploading and downloading data;  and a terminal feature that 
        supports  a  second modem,  communications ports,  and phone 
        lines.  

        That last feature is said to enable a  user  to  answer  one 
        modem aned dial out on the other.  

        The  new  feature,  called  terminal  mode,  can route calls 
        through   to   other   systems   using   two   modems,   two 
        communciations  ports,  and two telephone lines.  The system 
        can answer either line,  or it can  answer  one  line  while 
        dialing out on the other.  

        The  program  has  a  suggested  retail  price  of  $249 and 
        requires a minimum of 256K bytes of RAM.  

        With BBS-PC,  users can create a communciations network  for 
        businesses,  compujter-user groups,  organizations or public 
        access.  The program's sysop operator has  complete  control 
        over  all  access to the system and each of its 16 sections, 
        the company said.  

        Some of the sections can be open to any  caller  and  others 
        can  be  restricted.  According  to  the company,  up to 256 
        security levels are possible with the  BBS-PC.  Each  user's 
        access  can  include  or  exclude  read,  write,  upload  or 
        download functions.  

        The program also is said to maintain communciations at  1200 
        bps  or  2400  bps,  and  it supports a variety of protocols 
        including  Modem,  Xmodem,  Modem7,   and  other  Modem-line 
        transfer  protocols,  as  well  as  the  ASCII-line or block 
        transmission modes.  

        The  software  options  of  BBS-PC  are  said  to  configure 
        communications parameters,  line-feed options,  message-base 
        size and member-base size,  and to allow separate  directory 
        paths for those files.  

        Typically, the BBS-PC system can include up to four setions: 
        the  default  drive or directory;  the message-base section; 
        the member-base section; and the upload/download section.  

        The directory includes the system program,  the master  data 







FIDONEWS     --           08 Jul 85  00:00:45           Page 6

        file,  and  a  user-log data file.  The directory is said to 
        provide true message formatting to the caller's terminal; to 
        maintain permanent  user  records;  and  to  let  uers  send 
        private messages that can be read only by the addressee.  

        Also, the directory reclaims message space when messages are 
        deleted,  and  will  provide  new  space,  if necessary,  to 
        support new entries, the developer said.  

        While the program can reside on  dual-disk  or  single-disk-
        drive  systems,  each section of the program can be assigned 
        its own drive,  or,  in the case of systems with  hard  disk 
        drives,  each  section  can  be  assigned its own directory, 
        according to Micro-Systems.  

        One feature of the system is  said  to  be  its  ability  to 
        isolate  the  user  from  the  host  directory  and  the DOS 
        environment.  The program's higher-level software  directory 
        maintains  all  upload  and  download  files,   and  handles 
        carrier-loss recovery - without a host-system reset  -  even 
        during file uploads or downloads.  

        The  program  is  said  to contain a "help" screen and other 
        files that can be edited or altered to suit the needs  of  a 
        particular user.  

        Those  information  features  include items such as a log-on 
        message that  identifies  the  system  and  welcomes  users; 
        messages for new users;  information on the system,  such as 
        its purpose or the equipment being used;  and messages  that 
        aid in using the bulletin board or uploading and downloading 
        files.  

        The  program  also is said to include a terminal option that 
        can end a call with one keystroke.  This is intended  to  be 
        used  as  a  means  of dealing with nuisance calls or system 
        crashers.  

        Also included in the program is a "blanking" feature that is 
        designed to prevent video burn-in.  

        In addition,  there is a call-length  limiting  feature,  as 
        well  as  a "sleep" feature that allows the computer to shut 
        down for a period of inactivity, the developer said.  

        Other software available from Micro-Systems  includes  (blah 
        blah blah blah...) 

        Boy, doesn't Fido for no bucks sound like a better deal!

                            MASTER FIDO USERLIST


        A few issues ago there was an article about compiling a
        master list of FIDO USERS, Here is where the project now
        stands:

        We finally got enough response from the sysops to compile
        the first test version of the master "USERLIST".  The test
        was done with the response from 33 nodes.  We came out with
        a total of 5500 users between all the boards,  and after
        exact duplicates were removed we ended up with 4500 names.
        This list was just the TEST version to see if it was
        possible so it will not be made public (Especially since we
        all split into nets,  the Net/Node numbers that were sent
        in are not applicable any more).  This is a PLEA to all
        sysops.........

                 PLEASE SEND US YOUR USERLISTS AFTER THEY ARE
        COMPILED WITH SHIPUSER.COM!!!!

        If we don't get a larger response the whole project will be
        a waste!  We would like this to be done on a steady basis,
        say at least monthly or bi-monthly,  but to do this we need
        LOTS OF COOPERATION.

        Hopefully this master list will stir up increased usage of
        FIDONET mail by users instead of mostly sysops as it is
        today, becuase you'll know where to find the person to whom
        you want to send a message.  Also if this thing does work
        out we might try to have it published which would increase
        the popularity of all of our boards.

        If you don't have the program SHIPUSER.COM you can get it
        from Fido 107/0 in the USERLIST section,  then please
        forward the userlists back to node 107/0 or 107/3 either
        in FIDONET mail or by uploading it.  The next master list
        will be compiled on JULY 15, 1985 and then distributed
        starting the next day.

        Very sorry, folks.  SEAboard went down sometime during the 
        week while your humble editor was on vacation.  Hence, it 
        was not up Sunday night in order to create this issue of 
        Fidonews on time.

        Also, our local net, Net 107, has renumbered its nodes.  As 
        of the latest node list, we are now at node 7 in net 107.  
        As usual, we need and want your articles, so please ship 
        them to us at 107/7.
