                              Editorial
========================================================================
    We have a rather dangerous precident this week.  An network
co-ordinator has been told that publishing an article in
Fidonews is grounds for excommunication.

    When Max and I took over the editorship of the snooze, I
made a personal promise to Tom Jennings to run it according to
his ideals, at least as best as we could.  That did not include
a completely blind adherenec to the "we print what we get"
motto, but close to it.  Grounds for not running an article are
left to the discretion of the editors.  They might include
commercialism, or even triviality, but never simple questioning
of authority.

    Through the last few years, we have run many articles that
have attacked our personal integrity without comment.  We have
published articles in spite of middle of the night harrasment
calls, legal threats, and even, in one case a bomb threat.

    I deeply resent this muzzling of the snooze, and consider it
not only a personal insult, but, if allowed uncontested, a
threat to the existance of fidonet.  I am signing this
editorial, the first one I ever have signed.

Subject: Previous Article
From: Zorch Frezberg (1:205/0)

Dear Sir:

I submitted an article for publication in FidoNews on the
evening of November 12, 1995.

I am formally requesting that this article be retracted and not
published.

I am making this retraction as I have been informed that the
criticism of the Interim Regional Coordinator, Jeff Reese, his
failure to provide proof of his appointment, and criticism of
Zone Coordinator Bob Satti for failing to notify any other
Region 10 sysop of the appointment, shall constitute "working
against" the Interim Regional Coordinator.

The  penalty  for  such  criticism  is  immediate summary
excommunication from FidoNet, an action which, according to the
Interim Regional Coordinator, will be backed by the Zone
Coordinator without question.

Therefore, at this time, I am asking that the previous article
submitted by myself be excluded from publication.

You may, of course, place this request for retraction in place
of that article.

Thank you for your consideration and assistance in this matter.

Subject: Hope for /\/\irageNet
From: Mark Hoover (1:275/103)

Dear Editor,

After the local RC put an end to my mass mailing campaign, I
have had to find another way to ask sysops to join a new network
that I'm trying to expand. I asked him for an alternative
suggestion and he said to try placing an item in FidoNews.

I'm not really enthusiastic about this approach because I'm not
to sure about how many people actually read the thing. I know a
lot of them down here in Net 285 just delete it when the file
appears. But, I'm willing to try this alternative since I'm not
left with much of a choice anymore.

If you could please give me some guidelines for posting an
article I'd appreciate it. If you'd like to see our welcome
packet for yourself you can Freq it from my system as MIRAGE.

Editors note:

The specs for an article are quite simple. ASCII text only,
do not go beyond 72 characters per line, and an "*" in the first
character of a line is reserved for the title. Sending it as a
file makes it easier for us, but we will pull the article out of
a message if it comes in that way.
