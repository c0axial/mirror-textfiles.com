     =================================================================
                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================


     This past week,  Bob  Hartman and I had the pleasure of attending
     the fourth European FidoNet Conference, held in Antwerp, Belgium.
     As the only two  Americans  present, we had perhaps a more unique
     perspective on the event than  most  attendees.   As the FidoNews
     editor, allow me to present a few of them.

     First  let's  discuss  the  relative  size    of  EuroCon  versus
     "FidoCon."  I  have  attended  three FidoCons and  two  EuroCons.
     Based  on  that,  it  doesn't  appear  that  the  North  American
     conference  enjoys  any real advantage in terms of attendance  or
     location.  Antwerp is as nice a place as you  could  ever hope to
     be at night.  There are more pubs there than...  well, you know.

     Then  we  can consider the relevance of technical content.  There
     were at  least  as  many bona fide FidoNet software developers on
     the technical track  at  EuroCon  as  I  have  seen  at  any such
     conference.    The  discussions   were  frank,  and  constructive
     proposals made.  In my  opinion  the  TechCon  track  was  a  big
     success, and Jan Ceuleers should be  proud of what he was able to
     organize there.

     Finally, there's the political part.  For  those  of you who just
     don't think you've had a good day until you've been into a battle
     with some dweeb who doesn't know what he's talking about, EuroCon
     came   with  two  straight  days  of  political  hullabaloo.    I
     fortunately managed  to  miss  nearly  all of it.  Others will be
     along at some point soon with those details, including the latest
     on the European FidoNet Assocation.

     On the lighter side,  for a few moments I was leading in the Hard
     Disk throwing contest.  Everyone  seemed to think that was really
     funny, since the prize was D'Bridge  keys  for  my entire net.  I
     pointed out that since I was attending  as  1:1/1,  all of Zone 1
     should get keys.  Fortunately for Chris Irwin's  market  in North
     America,  a  couple of powerful Italians were able to eclipse  my
     puny toss.

     Next year, EuroCon is to be held in Italy.  I was around for that
     part of the political discussions.  Most interesting.  In Europe,
     the organizing committee for a given year is made responsible for
     examining proposals for the  following  year's  conference.   The
     sole proposal received by the  deadline  was from Italy.  After a
     few procedural issues were resolved, Italy was approved by a vote
     of 49 to 0, with 12 abstentions (most of them Italians).  I think
     that this particular way of doing things is  one  that  should be
     explored for FidoCon site selection.

     Please  don't  get  the  idea  that  I'm  trying  to belittle the
     conferences that have been held in North America.  But those held
     in Europe  have  proven  to be of the same calibre, and deserve a
     bit more attention  than  FidoNet  at  large  seems to have given
     them.  Perhaps now  that IFNA is about to succumb to the truth of
     its nonexistence, we could consider  having a "FidoCon" somewhere
     outside of this continent.

     If we do, I'll certainly do my best to be there.

     ITALY, the land of sunshine, good wine, the Mundiale, pizza's,
     spaghetti, ice-cream, beautiful women and ...


                           ...  EUROCON-V !!


     This year, on April 21st to be exact, the EUROCON-IV Committee
     placed the following (abbreviated) article in FidoNews to call
     for candidates as host-country for EUROCON-V.

     <QUOTE>

      ________ Call for candidates !

     As in the past, the site of the next EUROCON will be appointed
     by the last organising committee.   Knowing how precious time
     can be from our own experience (ever tried to get funding from
     a national or local government or the European Community ?) the
     EUROCONIV committee has decided to call for candidates for the
     next EUROCON to be held in 1991 as of TODAY.

     Provided there are candidates (!) we thus will be able to
     appoint the EUROCONV  site on july 15th, the last day of this
     years convention.

     The selection will be done by a popular vote between the
     participants of EUROCONIV, out of a pre selected batch of
     serious candidates meeting minimum standards as will be judged
     necessary at that time.

      ________ How to post your candidacy ?

     Simple : Send us by NetMail to 2:2/999 following information :

     ...

      _________ And the deadline ?

     Well, let's say July 1st, which gives us a fortnight to examine
     your offer, and will keep your nerves not too long on the edge.

     <UNQUOTE>

     FidoNews 7-30                Page 4                   23 Jul 1990


     The same article was shortly after published in EMBBS as well,
     and as a reminder was also broadcast via the Zone-2 echoes
     ENET.SYSOP and EURO4.

     So everybody operating a BBS anywhere in Europe at that time
     was aware of the call for candidates to organize a EUROCON in
     1991.

     Now you can say many things about Italians, but do never accuse
     them of not reading the FidoNet publications nor the
     sysop-echoes, because they do.

     Anyway, they complied with all the requirements put forward by
     the EUROCON-IV Committee.

     Moreover, it seemed to us that they had very good ideas about
     things to do in 1991, so we proposed them as our candidate to
     the plenum assembly of EUROCON-IV to vote.

     Let us also stress that after the termination of that
     subscription period up to the actual moment in the EUROCON-IV
     programme where we were dealing with next years' location, no
     other candidacy nor intention thereof reached the EUROCON-IV
     Committee.

     So, because :

     - We had a valid candidate
     - No objections, amendments nor modifications about or on the
     selection- procedure were voiced - Because the Zone-2
     coordinator had previously already approved the procedure

     ... a vote was taken among the sysops present at EUROCON-IV and the
     procedure as outlined was followed completely, correctly and
     democratically.

     It is with great joy and pride that we therefor are able to
     announce that EUROCON-V, the annual gathering of Zone-2
     FidoNet-sysops during 1991, will be held in Italy after an
     overwhelming majority of present Zone-2 sysops voted in its
     favor.

     In due time the Italian sysops will release all relevant
     information as to the dates, site and preliminary programme via
     the normal FidoNet channels.

     The Italian Organizing Committee is at the moment composed as
     follows :

         Alberto Morosi      2:331/101
         Domenico Cristofaro 2:334/800

         Franco Carcillo     2:334/1
     and Paolo Giulio Gialli 2:334/9

     The EUROCON-IV Committee wishes them all the best of luck in
     this venture and will support them whenever and wherever this
     may be necessary.

     See y'all next year at EUROCON-V in Italy.


     On behalf of the EUROCON-IV Committee

                        CURMUDGEON TOSS RULES at the
                      REGION 17 FIDONET(r) CONVENTION
                     (Thanks to Ken Zwaschka, 1:105/54)

     1. "Curmudgeon Tossing" is a team sport.  Teams may consist of
        two or more individuals.

     2. Since there is only one Curmudgeon, and there will certainly
        be a large number of contestants, teams must provide their
        own Curmudgeon Clone who meets the following criteria:

        A. Must be a current *C in the FidoNet organization.  Handicap
           points will be awarded based on the *C's ranking: e.g. one
           point for an N*C, 2 points for an R*C, etc.

        B. Additional handicap points will be awarded for Curmudgeon
           Clones attired in Levis, a flannel shirt, and Birkenstock
           sandals (one point for each item.)

        C. The Curmudgeon Clone must be a _WILLING_ participant,
           prior to the beginning of the TOSS, and may withdraw to a
           hot shower at any time.

     3. Objective: TOSS the Curmudgeon Clone into the exact center of
        the 30x75' pool from the "long" end.  The Curmudgeon Clone can
        help (by diving toward the center) - or hinder (depending on
        HOW willingly s/he offered to participate.)  Although not
        against the rules, it is considered unCurmudgeonlike to
        indicate - until the last minute - the degree of cooperation
        the team can expect from the Curmudgeon Clone.

     4. Each team will get three tries, with their best score counting.

     5. Although points will be carefully logged, final standing will
        be based on the totally subjective anarchical/dictatorial
        decision  of the Judgeon.

     6. The JUDGEON will, of course, be the CURMUDGEON himself.  No
        decisions will be final, and can be disputed, debated, and
        flamed endlessly without any resolution.

              Vega$Games -- A New Echomail Conference

     Have you ever come to Las Vegas -- or would you like to --
     for a little rest and relaxation, or for the world-famous
     Comdex trade show?  How about your BBS callers?  And while here,
     do you like to get in a little gambling, or perhaps attend a
     headliner show or two?  Do you like to dine in some of the
     town's finer restaurants or buffets?  Or take in the local
     sites like Lake Mead, the Valley of Fire, and Hoover Dam?

     If so, then a new echomail conference, called Vega$Games, is
     just right for your BBS.

     Some of the sysops in Vega$Net (Net 209) have been busy lately,
     creating and nurturing a new conference that originally dealt
     only with gambling, but has now expanded to include anything to
     do with our little corner of the U.S.A.  It has already proven
     popular with quite a few of the locals, and we have a pretty
     active message base.

     What will you and your callers find in Vega$Games?  Information,
     foremost.  What are the odds on rolling an 11 in craps?  How
     about getting that Ace at the Blackjack table?  Or what is the
     best way to play -- and beat -- a slot machine?  Knowledgeable
     locals "in the know" will tell you how!  And you can easily
     discuss and debate the merits of a particular system as well.

     What about entertainment values?  Who's playing at the Mirage
     this week, and how much does it cost, and is it worth going to?
     What's the best production show around these days?  And how about
     that new band playing in the lounge at the Golden Nugget?  You'll
     find out fast in Vega$Games.

     Want to know where to get the best steak in town after midnight?
     Or how about lobster or prime rib, all at a price that's easy on

     Pablo Kleinman (4:900/101)
     Latin American FidoNet Coordinator
     July 20, 1990

                    "The Worldwide FidoNet Policy"

         POLICY4 is already more than a year old, although it seems
     that all the controversy that accompanied its voting happened
     a long time ago.

         During all this time, many things occurred in the network:
     it grew intensively outside of North America, and democratic
     elections for Coordinators were held successfully, all over the
     world.

         POLICY4 was conceived as a strict and very -extremely-
     general policy to cover all the zones within FidoNet. But the
     results were not what it's promoters expected: it became an
     obstacle in many cases, especially outside of Zone ONE, and it's
     anti-democratic concept of administration was discredited by
     simple reality.

         For the ones like me, that opposed it from the beginning,
     the process of developing an alternative begun at the very
     moment of its approval. Jason Steck in Zone ONE wrote a POLICY5
     draft, Ron Dwight in Zone TWO also produced another draft, and
     myself in Zone FOUR, wrote the first version of WorldPol back in
     October of last year.

         WorldPol introduced the idea of an "umbrella" international
     policy document establishing the basic rules for FidoNet,
     empowering each Zone to establish its own policy document,
     according to its needs and customs.

         A few minutes ago, the sixth revision of WorldPol was
     published, and as the current policy document states, I already
     began asking all the Region Coordinators to concede a new
     referendum to  decide whether POLICY4 should be replaced by
     WorldPol.

         Here follows the text of the proposed World Policy Document
     for FidoNet (version 1f), published on July 20, 1990. Please
     note that it's about one fifth the size of POLICY4.

         Thanks for your time reading it.


                 FidoNet Worldwide Policy Document         Version 1f
                                                        July 20, 1990

       This Worldwide Policy document has been released for vote by
     the Coordinator structure and is not yet in force.

     1 FidoNet

       This document establishes an international (inter-zonal) policy
     for sysops who are members of the FidoNet organization of
     bulletin board systems worldwide.  FidoNet is defined by a list
     of nodes (NodeList) issued on a weekly basis by each of the Zone
     Coordinators, on behalf of the International Coordinator.

       Each FidoNet Zone is authorized to issue its own policy
     document, according to its own needs and customs.  This
     International Policy, sets general rules which must be specified
     -and may not be contradicted- by the Zone Policies.

       Regions and local Networks may also issue their own policies,
     provided such policies do not contradict this International
     Policy or the respective Zone's policy.


     1.1 Overview

       FidoNet is an amateur electronic mail system.
     As such, all of its participants and operators are unpaid
     volunteers. From its nearly beginning in 1984, as a few friends
     swapping messages back and forth mainly in North America, it
     consists now of an International community of more than seven
     thousand systems in six continents.

       FidoNet is not a common carrier or a value-added service
     network and is a public network only as much as the independent,
     constituent nodes may individually provide public access to the
     network on their system.

       FidoNet exists to provide electronic mail services to its
     member sysops.
     To efficiently provide such services, various structure and
     control mechanisms are necessary. The structure is organized into
     multiple nets, with decentralized administration.

       This document describes all of the procedures at the
     international level of FidoNet, as well as some general rules for
     the lower levels (intra-zonal), developed to manage the network.
     Authorities in the international level not defined by this
     document, shall be defined by the Zone Coordinators Council and
     the International Coordinator.


     2 Language

       Each zone has the right to determine its own official language.

       At the international (inter-zonal) level, for practical
     purposes, FidoNet adopts English as its official language. All
     the FidoNet documents issued at the international level must
     exist in English. Translation into other languages is encouraged.

     3 Organization

       The organizational structure of FidoNet, has been developed to
     distribute the administration and control of FidoNet, to the
     lowest possible level, while still allowing for coordinated
     action over the entire system.
       Effective administration is made possible by operating in a
     top-down manner.
       This means, that a person at any given level is responsible to
     the level above, and responsible for administrating the level
     below.

       If a person at any level above sysop is unable to properly
     perform their duties, the person at the next level may replace
     them.  For example, if a Region Coordinator fails to perform, the
     Zone Coordinator may cause the Coordinator to be replaced.
     Coordinators may also be removed by a majority vote of the level
     below. For example, if network Coordinators in a region lose
     faith in the ability of a Region Coordinator to effectively
     perform, they may vote to have a new Coordinator appointed.


     3.1 International Coordinator

       The International Coordinator (IC) is the Executive Officer of
     FidoNet.
     This is the highest authority of the network's top-down
     organization and coordinates the joint production of the master
     nodelist by the Zone Coordinators. The International Coordinator
     is responsible of creating new zones in FidoNet, but can only do
     so with the approval of the Zone Coordinator Council.

       The International Coordinator is selected by unanimous vote of
     the Zone Coordinators, and removed by a majority vote of the Zone
     Coordinators.


     3.2 Zone Coordinator Council

       The Zone Coordinator Council (ZCC) consists of the Zone
     Coordinators -each having a single vote- and the International
     Coordinator; in the event of a ZCC vote tie, the International
     Coordinator may cast an additional vote to untie the election.

       The Zone Coordinator Council is the legislative body of
     FidoNet, it represents each of the zones in FidoNet. It is the
     highest authority of the network's Top-Down organization.


     3.3 Zones and Zone Coordinators

     FidoNews 7-30                Page 15                  23 Jul 1990


       A zone is a geographic area containing one or many regions,
     covering one or more countries.

       The Zone Coordinator is the Executive Officer of the Zone, and
     the zone's representative to the other zones.

       The Zone Coordinator compiles the nodelists from all of the
     regions in the zone, creates a master nodelist and a difference
     file, which is then distributed over FidoNet within the zone. A
     Zone Coordinator does not perform message-forwarding services for
     any nodes in the zone, although the Zone Coordinator is
     responsible for the formation and/or administration of one or
     more zone-gates to provide interzone mail facilities.

       The method used for selection of Zone coordinators is left to
     the  discretion of the relevant Zone Policy.  In the absence of a
     Zone Policy selection method, Zone Coordinators are elected and
     removed by a majority  vote of the Region Coordinators in the
     Zone.


     3.4 Regions and Region Coordinators

       A Region is a well-defined geographic area containing nodes
     which may or may not be combined into networks. A typical Region
     will contain many nodes in networks, and a few independent nodes
     which are not part of the network.

       The Region Coordinator maintains the list of independent nodes
     in the region, and accepts nodelists from the Network
     Coordinators in the Region.
     These are compiled to create a regional nodelist, which is sent
     to the Zone Coordinator. A Region Coordinator may perform
     message-forwarding services for any nodes in the region, but is
     not forced to.

       The method used for selection of Regional coordinators is left
     to the discretion of the relevant Zone or Region Policy.  In the
     absence of such a policy selection method, Region Coordinators
     are elected and removed by a majority vote of the NCs in the
     Region.


     3.5 Networks and Network Coordinators

       A network is a group of nodes, normally in a local geographic
     area. Networks coordinate their mail activity to decrease cost.

       The Network Coordinator is responsible for maintaining the list
     of nodes for the network, and for forwarding netmail sent to
     members of the network from other FidoNet nodes. The Network
     Coordinator may make arrangements to handle outgoing netmail, but
     is not required to do so.

     FidoNews 7-30                Page 16                  23 Jul 1990


       The method used for selection of Network coordinators is left
     to the discretion of the relevant Zone/Region/Net Policy.  In the
     absence of such a policy selection method, Network Coordinators
     are elected and removed by a majority vote of the Nodes in the
     Network.


     3.5.1  Network Routing Hubs

       Network Routing Hubs exist only in some networks. They may be
     appointed by the Network Coordinator, in order to assist the
     management (especially routing tasks) of the network.


     3.6 Individual systems (Nodes)

       The smallest subdivision of FidoNet is the individual system,
     corresponding to a single entry in the nodelist. The system
     operator (SysOp) formulates a policy for running the board and
     dealing with the users. The sysop must mesh with the rest of the
     FidoNet system to receive and send mail, and the local policy
     must be consistent with other levels of FidoNet.


     3.6.1 Users of an individual system

       The sysop is responsible for the actions of any user when they
     affect the rest of FidoNet (i.e. if the user is annoying, the
     sysop is annoying). The users have no rights under this policy
     document.


     3.6.2 Points

       A point is a system that is not in the nodelist, but
     communicates with FidoNet through a node defined to as bossnode.
     A point is generally regarded in the same manner as a user and,
     for example, the bossnode is responsible for mail from the point.
     Points are addressed using the bossnode's nodelist address; for
     example, a point system with a bossnode of 125/111 might be known
     as 125/111.6. Mail sent to the point will be sent to the
     bossnode, which then routes it to the point.

       Point operators are not FidoNet members, they are only users of
     a FidoNet node, as any other regular user; they have no rights
     under this policy document.


     4 General Procedures for All Coordinators

     4.1 Making Available Difference Files and Nodelist

     FidoNews 7-30                Page 17                  23 Jul 1990


       Each Coordinator is responsible for obtaining and making
     available for file request and download by users, on a weekly
     basis, nodelist difference files and complete nodelists.


     4.2 Processing Nodelist Changes and Passing Them Upstream

       Each Coordinator is responsible for obtaining nodelist
     information from the level below, processing it, and passing the
     results to the level above.
     The timing of this process is determined by the requirements
     imposed by the level above.


     4.3 Ensure the Latest Policy is Available

       A Coordinator is responsible to make the current version of the
     International Policy available to the level below, and to
     encourage familiarity with it.


     4.4 Minimize the Number of Hats Worn

       Coordinators are encouraged to limit the number of
     FidoNet-related Coordinator functions they perform. A Coordinator
     who holds two different positions, compromises the appeal
     process. For example, is the Network Coordinator is also the
     Region Coordinator, sysops in that network are denied one level
     of appeal.

       Multiple hats are also discouraged due to the difficulty of
     replacing services when a coordinator leaves the net.

     4.5 Be a Member of the Area Administered

       A Coordinator must be a member of the area administered. This
     is, a Network Coordinator must be a member of that network by
     virtue of geography.
     A Region Coordinator must be either a member of a network in the
     region, or an independent in a region.


     4.6 Encourage New Sysops to Enter FidoNet

       A Coordinator is encouraged to operate a public bulletin board
     system which is freely available for the purpose of distributing
     Policy and Nodelists to potential new sysops. Dissemination of
     this information to persons who are potential FidoNet sysops is
     important to the growth of FidoNet, and Coordinators should
     encourage development of new systems.

     FidoNews 7-30                Page 18                  23 Jul 1990


     4.7 Tradition and Precedent

       A Coordinator is not bound by the practices of predecessor.
     However, it must be clear that Coordinators are bound by all
     requirements of this document, both as FidoNet sysops and as
     Coordinators. The holding of a Coordinator title does not grant
     license to annoy others or to flaunt policy.


     4.8 Technical Management

       The primary responsibility of any Coordinator is technical
     management of network operations. Decisions SHOULD be made only
     on technical grounds. A Coordinator has the responsibility to act
     as objectively as possible; objectivity must be considered an
     essential factor when making a decision.


     4.9 Exclusivity of Zone Mail Hour

       Zone Mail Hour is the heart of FidoNet, as this is when network
     mail is passed between systems.  Any system which wishes to be a
     part of FidoNet must be able to receive mail during this time
     using the protocol defined in the current FidoNet Technical
     Standards Committee publication (FTS-0001 at this writing).  It
     is permissible to have greater capability (for example, to
     support additional protocols or extended mail hours), but the
     minimum requirement is FTS-0001 capability during this one hour
     of the day.

       This time is exclusively reserved for netmail.  Many phone
     systems charge on a per-call basis, regardless of whether a
     connect, no connect, or busy signal is encountered.  For this
     reason, any activity other than normal network mail processing
     that ties up a system during ZMH is considered annoying behavior.
       User (BBS) access to a system is prohibited during ZMH.

       Zone Mail Hour will be defined by each Zone Policy. In the
     absence of a Zone Policy, it will be defined by the Zone
     Coordinator.


     5. Election and Referendum Procedures

       Any election or referendum at any level of FidoNet, must be
     democratic.
       Each zone will issue its own election procedures, which must be
     approved by the Zone Coordinator Council before implementation.

       If a worldwide election, with the participation of all zones,
     is to be held, the Zone Coordinator Council will determine the
     election procedures.

     FidoNews 7-30                Page 19                  23 Jul 1990


     6 Policy Referenda

     6.1 International Policy

       A referendum on International Policy modification is invoked by
     the International Coordinator upon request from a majority of the
     Zone Coordinators, or a majority of the Region Coordinators of
     all zones, or a majority of the Network Coordinators of all
     zones.

       All the members of FidoNet are entitled to vote on an
     International Policy referendum, which is to be held according to
     the procedures described by the Zone Coordinator Council before
     the election is called.


     6.2 Zone Policy

       A referendum on Zone Policy modification is invoked by the Zone
     Coordinator, by a majority vote of the Region Coordinators in the
     zone, or by a majority vote of the Network Coordinators in the
     zone.

       All the members of the zone are entitled to vote on a Zone
     Policy referendum, which is to be held according to the
     procedures described on the Zone Policy. If such document does
     not exist, the procedures will be determined by the Zone
     Coordinator with the approval of the Zone Coordinator Council.

       The formulation of Region and Network Policy documents is
     encouraged, and must be regulated by the Zone Policy documents in
     each zone.


     7 Resolution of Disputes

       The FidoNet judicial philosophy can be summed up in two rules:

            1) Thou shalt not excessively annoy others.

            2) Thou shalt not become excessively annoyed.

       The parties involved in a dispute are encouraged to solve their
     problems directly, without the intervention of a Coordinator.


     7.1 Mediation Requests

       Any of the parties involved may request the intervention of the
     respective Coordinator: Network Coordinator if a dispute between
     members of the same network, Region Coordinator if a dispute
     between members of different networks on the same region; Zone
     Coordinator if a dispute between members of different regions on
     the same zone; International Coordinator if a dispute between
     members of different zones.

     FidoNews 7-30                Page 20                  23 Jul 1990


       The Coordinator requested as "mediator", will ask each party to
     provide all the information before two weeks from the request and
     will make a decision within forty-five days after he received all
     the information from the involved parties.

       A Coordinator, unable to resolve a dispute, may name a third
     party to act as "mediator", provided the parties involved in the
     dispute agree.

     7.2 Appealing to a Mediator's Decision

       A mediator's decision may be appealed to the immediately
     superior level if considered unfair: Region Coordinators handle
     appeals from decisions made by Network Coordinators;  Zone
     Coordinators handle appeals from decision made by Region
     Coordinators; The International Coordinator handles appeals from
     decisions made by the Zone Coordinators; and the Zone Coordinator
     Council will handle appeals from decisions made by the
     International Coordinator,  being the Zone Coordinator Council's
     resolutions, unappealable.

       For appealing to a decision made by a third person named by a
     Coordinator to act as mediator, it will be as if the Coordinator
     made the resolution and the previously enumerated sequence of
     appealing will be appropriate.

       For appealing to a decision made by a mediator, the same terms
     and procedures as for any Mediation Request apply.


     7.3 Statute of Limitations

       A mediation request may not be filed more than 60 days after
     the date of discovery of the source of the infraction, either by
     admission or technical discovery of the source of an infraction,
     either by admission or technical evidence. Mediation requests may
     not be filed more than 120 days after the incident, unless they
     involve suspected unlawful behavior.


     7.4 Echomail

       Each FidoNet Zone is encouraged to establish it's Zone Policy
     concerning the manner of handling Echomail and the resolution of
     disputes arising from such distribution.

     Deadbeat Club --

     Aaaahhhhh.  Vacation started Friday at 8pm, and I'm not going
     anywhere.

     Honey, on the other hand, is taking the kid to DaneLand, so
     that gives me three whole weeks to do exactly what I want.
     Bliss.

     Well, except there is so much to do.  I see a new BinkleyTerm
     is out, got to get that modified and installed.  I had some
     changes to the previous version; call timers and RINGING
     counters.  I may even get around to stuffing in OPUS 1.10.

     Then there are the various 'second jobs' I need to get finished
     up on.  Should have plenty of time for those, except that the
     boys at the office know I'm home, and will probably call
     anyway.

     I need to get out to Santa Barbara to visit my sister.  They
     had that huge fire, and it look like a bunch of PCs got burned
     up.  My brother-in-law runs a computer sales business, and he
     needs some help.

     Add to that the big list of Honey-Dews ( Honey do this, and do
     that ) around the house.  I am living on Channel Z.

     "Space junk, ozone holes, laser bombs, better put my umbrella."


     Holy Chipset, Batman --

     I like to pull out a little chart for my semi-knowledgable
     co-workers, it looks a little like this :

         1983   86  4 Mh
         1985  286  8 Mh
         1987  386 16 Mh
         1989  386 33 Mh
         1991  486 ??

     If we get a jump like '85 to '87, the ?? would be 60 Mh.  If
     the jump is like '87 to '89, it may only be 33 Mh.  You say
     "Hey wait, this is 1990", you are right, but what I didn't list
     was the base price of US $5000.  Interesting isn't it.


     Honey Trap --

     All you 'drenger' in Daneland, here's the scoop.  Call up
     42-454247 and ask for Helle.  Then say something nice, like
     "Velkommen hjem from 'ACE'".

     From:   Simon Foster of 3:712/265.0
     To:     Vince Perriello of 1/1.0
     Subj:   Letter to the Editor.

     Volume 7, Number 27                                   2 July 1990

                         Is our Echo Mail Broken?
                    And How long has it been this way?

        I live in Region 18. I am very fortunate because I have two
     ...
        participants.   Are  we  sewing  the  mouth  shut on our guest
        speakers?
                        by Kenneth "Kevin" Snively
                             1:116/24 EET BBS
                          1:116/29 the Dawg Byte
                     1:116/28 The Nashville HUB System

     The above (truncated :-)) article appeared in FIDONews 7-27 about
     the unreliability of EchoMail  in  1:18  and  I  think this is an
     appropriate  time  to bring up  the  condition  of  EchoMail  and
     NetMail routing within Zone 3.

     I would like to take this  oppurtunity to thank all involved with
     routing netmail and providing echomail within Zone  3.    It  has
     always  been impecable and never gets censored (eh,  Jenny  :-)).
     There    has  never  been  any  difficulties  whatsoever  in  the
     distribution of echomail and all and sundry have been helpful and
     courteous from my experience.

     Since  I  have  only  been nodelisted since the beginning of this
     year  I do not know who set up Zone 3 and gave  it  such  a  good
     ground  work  of  RC,  NC  and HUBs to allow such smooth Echo and
     NetMail  but  wish  to  give  a  hearty  thanx to all who did for
     allowing Zone  3  to be free of the problems that 'Kevin' Snively
     and his fellow Region 18'ers have experienced.

     Regs,
           Simon

     PS A reply  as  to  whether this mail reached you or not would be
     greatly appreciated as I don't trust Zone 1 mail routing :-(

     [Editor's note:  The Zone 1 routing seems  to  have  worked.   My
     sincerest thanks to all those in Zone 1 who made it possible.]
