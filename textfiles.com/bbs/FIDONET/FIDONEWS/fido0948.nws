                              EDITORIAL
======================================================================


FidoNews has a new address within FidoNet: 1:1/23. Email addressed to
the old address will be forwarded to the current, new address until
January 1993. This change takes effect IMMEDIATELY.


The reason is the incredible amount of email sent to 1:1/1 by poorly
designed FidoNet mailers, sysops not paying attention, bad
installations, and the occasional user error. Zone1-net1-node1 seems
to be the "default address" for many programs when they get confused.
It has sometimes taken weeks to get the responsible sysop to stop
daily echotosses numbering in the hundreds of messages per week,
improperly sent to the old FidoNews address.

Starting January 1993, you'll see mailer, echo-toss and other FidoNet
email related tools generating error messages (because the old
"default" address won't exist in the nodelist!) rather than annoying
the FidoNews Editor. Good riddance!

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Editorial: CHANGE OF ADDRESS

by Tom Jennings (1:1/23)


Please note that FidoNews has a new FidoNet network address, 1:1/23,
zone 1, region 1, node 23 -- twenty-three. Mail to the old address
will be forward through the end of the year, then it will be CUT OFF.

Why may you ask go through this painful process? Because of all the
bogus mail I get, incorrectly addressed to numerically unique "1:1/1"
by LOUSY SOFTWARE and INATTENTIVE SYSOPS. Some weeks, I get
multiple-hundreds of messages, usually echomail tosses, and destined
for some interesting destination I'm sure, but are dropped in my
machine by bad routing.

Well soon I'll have my revenge, as starting 1 January 1993 there won't
BE a "1:1/1" in the nodelist, and all those sysops will notice, and
hopefully they'll complain to the (mumble) program authors.

But in the mean time, please change all of your records to indicate
the new address, effective IMMEDIATELY!

Since I joined Fidonet in 1988, I have been unable to understand the
mortal fear that many in this network have about instituing democracy.

I've heard all the excuses that many have offered to explain away the
need for democracy in a network that now contains over 20,000 nodes.
They've been as flimsy as the recent decision to annoint a new Zone
Coordinator from among the "all-knowing."

God forbid that Fidonet elections turn into "popularity contests," as
we have heard time and time again as an excuse to keep voting to a
minimum.

This is an excuse used recently by Fidel Castro and the Glorious Leader
Kim Il-Sung of North Korea; it should not be one to prevent free and
fair elections in Fidonet.

Just as these unpopular leaders know that they stand little chance of
winning back their posts in a free and open election, many of the "good
ole boys" in Fidonet realize they don't have a prayer of winning
re-election after the kind of "leadership" they have offered.

So, in lieu of elections, we have excuses.

"It would be too complicated to hold elections for every position in
Fidonet, from HC to IC."

Administering a network with over 15,000 people in it is no problem,
but allowing many of those nodes to cast ballots for those that
represent them is apparently too much to fathom by some.  Maybe
those people see it as too much work for no personal gain.

Well folks, that dog don't hunt.

For years, we've heard the lip service from our own "Glorious Leaders"
telling us that democracy is on the way, just wait a LITTLE longer.
With the recent decision to annoint a new ZC for Zone 1 from within the
family, we'll be waiting longer for democracy in Fidonet than the
French wait for fine wine.

Make no mistake.  The biggest insult of all is to post a want-ad for
the position in the nodelist segment in the first place.  After all,
99% of those that receive that file have no chance to run for the
position, much less vote on it.

FidoNews 9-48                  Page 3                      30 Nov 1992


What we are waiting for, fellow nodes, is for a new Fidonet Pope to be
chosen.  One that our "Glorious Leaders" have handpicked for their
known cowtowin...  I mean, SERVICE... yeah, SERVICE to the guiding,
"time-honored" principles of Fidonet.

Why?  Because we all know and trust our "Glorious Leaders" to decide
what is best for us.  These people have connections...err...  to the
heartbeat of Fidonet.

All humor aside, elections of the kind now being prepared by our
"Glorious Leaders" can still be found in Cuba, North Korea, Laos,
Zaire, and other countries which offer up candidates that belong to
hack organizations or are groomed for the post by a group of
kingmakers.

In this country, we used to use "means tests" to keep classes of people
from casting ballots in elections.  Today, we recognize those practices
as patently undemocratic and unfair, except in Fidonet where we call
it "efficiency."

The only hidden blessing in all of this is the newly set precedent that
Policy can be ignored when it suits your own purposes.  If you want to
implement something not in Policy, just "add" it long enough to make
the changes you want in the network.

We, as individual nodes, can begin demanding some additions of our own,
starting with free and open elections for the Zone Coordinator among
all the nodes that are served by that person.

How do you go about doing this?

When in Rome, do as the Romans do.  Find out who your friends are.
Start by finding out your Region Coordinator's position on democracy.
Is he/she willing to stand for elections?  Is he/she willing to offer
up their own amendments to Policy 4 which insist on free
and open elections?

If the answer is no, or if you get still more lip service, you've just
identified part of the problem.  Next, inform the masses by sending
in your replies to Fidonews.  Let's ALL know who the real friends of
Fidonet are.  Then, we can begin identifying those who are being
groomed for future positions of power in this network, and work hard
to break the chain of the Good Ole Boy network.

Since individual nodes can't have their own THROW THE BUMS OUT
movement because they can't vote, they can at least put the pressure
on these people by bombarding them with netmail insisting on change,
until they get so sick and tired of hearing about it, they relent.

Fidonet is about people, in LOCAL COMMUNITIES, working together to
make Fidonet something worthwhile.  It's not about bureaucrats who
live hundreds of miles away telling us what is best.  Let's put
the power back in the hands of individual nodes.

From: bwebster@pages.com (Bruce F. Webster)

AP news item in today's San Diego Union:

Headline: "CIA chief hints change needed in ban on probing Americans"

Excerpts:

WASHINGTON--CIA Director Robert Gates says changes might be needed in
the U.S. law that forbids the agency from collecting information about
Americans or U.S. companies.

Such changes might enable the CIA to better support the Justice
Department and other law enforcement agencies, he said in an interview
with the Associated Press.

The idea grew out of a recent storm of accusations by Democrats in
Congress, Justice Department officials and a federal judge that the
CIA withheld information in the case of $5.5 billion lending scheme to
Iraq by an Atlanta bank.

...

Under current law, the CIA is strictly forbidden to collect
information on Americans or American companies.

"At some point it seems to me, very early on, we and Justice...and the
Congress are going to have to...have some sort of serious discussion
about whether there are changes in the law that are needed that will
clarify some of the ambiguities and what we can and cannot do in
support to law enforcement," Gates said.

He did not elaborate.

Due to the fact that yet another better AND faster file
compressor  is now available, Requests for newsletter issues
now have a different extention.  The file that created the
'.SQZ' files is requestable by a magic name  of "SQZ" to
anyone interested.  For this year's issues all issues are
available in Squeeze-It format only.

FidoNews 9-48                  Page 5                      30 Nov 1992


The signature for Sqz files is as follows for dos platforms:
Offset 0000h
       48h 4Ch 53h 51h 5Ah

Here is a comparison between  Previous issues of fidonews
compressed with ARJ, and then with Squeeze-it. There are no
file comments in any files.

Squeeze-It is a bit on the primate side, but the issues in
selecting an appropriate compression method are $$$ and $$$.
Personally, I find that Squeeze-It is much less annoying
than any other compressor, and all of my filebase is now in
that format.  The new format will cut 3% off of your
requests for these issues, and although it isn't much, it's
still a savings somewhere.  In comparison to other software,
I find the author to be about the least annoying.  I define
annoying by how much the author hassles for registrations.
No 'time bomb', all features that exist work, and next
payday he'll be getting his $30.00US dollars for
registration.

Strengths:
 Speed and compression. (As compared to.ARJ and LHA)

Weaknesses:
Not enough features.  Recursive directory compression
exists, but there is no provision for moving files.
This new compressor is an unknown, which means most of your
archive recognition utilities wont work.  However, There is
at least one configurable utility that will work, and it's
pd software.  PolyXarc, by Jeffrey Nonken.

One final note:  The owners of the copywrite of Spaz
recently gave me permission to release a new version that
supports Squeeze-it format.  It should be available from
your local SDS site soonly, and it has a couple more
features.  [-L] to list the contents of the archive, and one
less bug. Spaz is available by file request as SPAZ, and
freqing spaz will always get you the latest version.

After all this 'policy' proposals I'd created the following. Now I
ask you: why not use this as our FidoNet guideline? Maybe this could
replace our outdated policy 4 document....

----------------------------------- cut ----------------------------
                       FidoNet Organization Rules

1. Definition of FidoNet

   FidoNet is a worldwide computer network, allowing humans to
   communicate with others. All members of FidoNet are listed in the
   FidoNet nodelist.

2. Technical requirements

   The technical requirements are defined in documents called
   FTS-xxxx.ext (xxxx is a number from 0001 to 9999).

3. Organization of FidoNet

   A nodenumber has 4 main parts: Zone:Net/Node.Point

   - Zones are cut into Regions
   - Regions are cut into Nets
   - Nets can use HUB's to serve Nodes
   - Nodes are systems in a Net
   - Points are connected to Nodes

   FidoNet has one International Coordinator (IC)
   Each Zone has a Zone Coordinator (ZC).
   Each Region has a Region Coordinator (RC).
   Each Net has a Net Coordinator (NC).

   A sysop is a systemoperator of one or more nodes.

   The task of a *C is to compile the nodelist-segment of his area,
FidoNews 9-48                  Page 7                      30 Nov 1992


   and to count votes if elections are held.

4. Elections

  - A *C is elected by a simple majority of the received votes of the
    sysops below his area.
  - Each sysop has one vote (even if he operates more than one node).
  - *C's are sysops and have no votes. They only count votes.
  - Each *C sum up the votes of the *C below, except the NC who counts
    the votes of the sysop.
  - Elections are held by a sysop which is not a candidates.

  IC election: Elected is, who receives the most votes of FidoNet.
  ZC election: Elected is, who receives the most votes of the zone.
  RC election: Elected is, who receives the most votes of the region.
  NC election: Elected is, who receives the most votes of the net.

  Each *C will be reelected at least every two years.
  If a *C fails his duties for more than 4 weeks he'll be replaced.

5. How to get a nodenumber

  Each human gets a nodenumber, if is he is able to operate a system
  which meets the technical requirements above.

6. Responsibilities of a node

  A node must follow this rules:

      1) Thou shalt not excessively annoy others.
      2) Thou shalt not be too easily annoyed.
      3) Thou shalt not violate the law in your country.

7. Removing a node

  A node will be removed from the nodelist, if more than 50% of the
  sysops in his net decides to exclude him.

Sorry for the native English, but we here in Switzerland normally don't
use this language. Any corrections are welcome!
