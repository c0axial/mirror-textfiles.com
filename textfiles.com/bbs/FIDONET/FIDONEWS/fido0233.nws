                            Daylight Losing Time


        This  coming  October  27th is the day when Daylight Savings 
        Time ends, at the ungodly hour of 2 AM (on a Sunday morning, 
        no less).  

        Once again we engage in our twice  yearly  shifting  of  the 
        network  mail  hour,  with  its  usual  confusion.  For  the 
        record,  the "approved" procedure is to set your clock  back 
        one  hour  sometime between Saturday morning mail and Sunday 
        morning mail (anytime during the day Saturday is cool).  

        But,  inevitably,  some people will forget,  one or two will 
        set  their  clocks the wrong way,  and many won't be able to 
        reach their machines until  Monday  anyway.  (Many  business 
        boards  are  in  company  areas that can't be reached on the 
        weekend.  Do they change their clocks on Friday before  they 
        leave, or Monday when they get back?  Who knows?) 

        Our  little  semiannual ritual also has other drawbacks.  It 
        seems Hawaii doesn't observe daylight savings time, and they 
        are far enough west that the summer shift  has  them  making

        VERY long distance calls at the more expensive evening rate.  

        Just  to  make  life  even more fun,  I'm told that parts of 
        Indiana, Kansas, Texas, Florida,  Michigan,  and Alaska also 
        do not observe daylight savings time.  

        So here's my suggestion, if it's not already obvious:  Let's 
        go ahead and get off of daylight savings  time  this  month, 
        and from then on forget about it.  If anybody complains,  we 
        can tell them that we're really running on  Greenwhich  Mean 
        Time  (or  Universal Coordinated Time,  as it's called these 
        days).  

        All this changing of clocks just isn't worth the hassle.  So 
        the clock on your system doesn't match  the  clock  on  your 
        wall,   so   big  deal!   The  users  will  never  know  the 
        difference, since it's hard to get the time of day from Fido 
        anyway.  [Could one then say that Fido wouldn't give you the 
        time of day?  Some other editorial, perhaps. . .]

                                  NEWS
        ============================================================
                         Greetings from

                        Mike's "C" Board 
                       Net 102 / Node 201
                          619-722-8724        

         The latest release of Fido,  ver 11, has reimplemented the 
        scrolling  download/upload display as default.  When it was 
        taken  away a few versions back I was glad to walk  in  and 
        see what was being downloaded or uploaded but would have no 
        idea  where  in  the transfer the user was.  But  this  was 
        better  than "Sending block 134" and not knowing  what  was 
        being  transferred or whether there where 650 blocks or  10 
        blocks  left.  Well now with the new version I can have  my 
        cake  and eat it too!  
          The  following  is the patch I applied to Fido using  the 
        Norton  Utilities 3.0 program "NU".  I couldn't figure  out 
        how  to  do this with debug because of the  Plink  overlays 
        used in Fido.

          1.  Copy  Fido to a blank disk and invoke NU B:  or  what 
        ever disk Fido is on. This insures that the program will be 
        stored contigously.

          2.  Next  press F1 then F3 to select a file and place the 
        highlighted  bar over FIDO_IBM.EXE.  Press return  and  you 
        will be back at the TOP MENU.

          3. Next press F2 then F4 to display information about the 
        file.  The  4th  line  down contains the  starting  cluster 
        number  with the sector number in parentheses.  Add 197  to 
        the sector number in parentheses and write the result down.   

          4.  Now  press  ESC then F1 then F5 to place you  in  the 
        Select  Disk  Sector  menu and enter the number  you  noted 
        earlier.   Press  enter  and then F5 to  enter  the  Change 
        Contents mode.   

          5. You should see all the usual messages that continually 
        scroll  by  as a file transfer is  taking  place.  Pressing 
        enter  twice will place you in the edit mode.  From here we 
        can  do  some  interesting things to Fido  to  enhance  the 
        existing display.  About 3/4 way down you will see  TIMEOUT 
        followed by two funny characters that are a carriage return 
        and newline (0D0A).  Change the second one, that looks like 
        an  O in reverse video to a space or hex 20 and do the same 
        following  "Sending  block #%u" two lines  down  and  after 
        "ACK" on the same line. These changes will make the display 
        overwrite  the  existing line during transfers  giving  the 
        effect  of  only  the  current block  number  changing  and 
        eliminating  the scrolling off the screen of the file  name 
        and number of total blocks.

         6.  If  you really want to be creative you can change  the 







FIDONEWS     --           30 Sep 85  03:02:34           Page 4

        Data  Block %u,  which I believe is used for  upload  along 
        with the "ACK character = %u" which I truncated to "ACK=%u" 
        and  null terminated and added the hex 0D before the  null.  
        The  message "Sending filename" also should be done to take 
        of the Telink protocal transfers.  Also what I have done is 
        by  hitting  the  PgDn  key  (Entering  W  for  write  when 
        requested  to  save  the changes) you will  see  the "----- 
        Yelling  at sysop ----" message the user see's when  the  C 
        key is pressed. I have changed it to "---- Hello... This is 
        Mike ----" making the interruption much more friendly.

          7.  When  finished  press ESC and answer W to  write  the 
        changes  to  disk and you have the new enhanced version  of 
        Fido!!!
         
         Though these patches are simple they accomplish  something 
        I  have asked for in fido,  but fell on deaf ears.   I keep 
        hearing  rumors  of  Fido look alikes in  the  making  with 
        source  and  all the bells and whisles you can  only  dream 
        were in Fido,  with full net compatibility. Tom has created 
        a  work of art that is worth recognition,  but lets have  a 
        masterpiece.   
          If you don't have Norton Utilities 3.0 I highly recommend 
        purchasing it, as I have found it to be a fascinating tool.  
        This  patch was only done on the IBM version but  could  be 
        easily applied to the DEC version as well.
                                                         
                          Enjoy!!   Mike Elkins

                       The UN*X Gateway is Complete!
                              by Bob Hartman
                            Sysop Fido 132/101
                           The UN*X Gateway BBS

                This is the news you UN*X hackers have been waiting
        for - the UN*X Gateway BBS is now capable of sending FidoNet
        mail on to UN*X systems as well as receiving UN*X mail to be
        sent via FidoNet!  In the past only the latter (UN*X->Fido)
        was working.  In order to use the gateway you must do the
        following:

        Sending Fido to UN*X:

        1.  Send a FidoNet message addressed to "Usenet" on the UN*X
            Gateway Fido (132/101).  The addressee of Usenet is what
            the system keys on, so make sure you get it right!
        2.  The first line of the message must be the UN*X UUCP path
            to be used to send the message.  This must be the only
            thing on the first line!  The path does not have to be
            complete as the host will try to figure out the best
            routing for the message, but the addresses to major hosts
            would be:
                encore!decvax
            or  encore!decvax!ucbvax
            or  encore!ihnp4
            To send a message to me use "vaxine!rch"
        3.  The rest of the message can be any legal FidoNet message.
        4.  When a message meeting these requirements gets to the
            gateway, it is converted to UN*X format and sent to the
            host named 'vaxine'.  This UN*X host then sends the mail
            to the address given in the first line of the message.

        Sending UN*X to Fido:

        1.  Send UN*X mail to either
                decvax!encore!vaxine!spark!net!node!username
            or  ihnp4!encore!vaxine!spark!net!node!username
            where net is the FidoNet net number, node is the FidoNet
            node number, and username is the name of the person to
            receive the message with all spaces changed to the
            underscore (_) character.  The name cannot have any
            quote marks or other punctuation characters in it except
            for the underscore character!  If it does contain any
            punctuation marks, then a UN*X mailer somewhere will not
            properly process the mail and it will get returned as
            undeliverable.
        2.  When this message reaches the host 'vaxine', it is sent
            through a special mail processor that routes it to the
            gateway using Kermit.
        3.  Once it is received at the gateway, it is processed and
            changed into FidoNet mail to the appropriate person at
            the given Fido node.

        This gateway has been tested, but if you try it and notice

        something that seems to be wrong, please let me know so that
        I can try to fix it.

                         The aliens are coming!
                         The aliens are coming!

                             by Dave Barry


        I  don't  want  to  alarm  anybody,  but  there  is  an 
        excellent  chance  that  the Earth will be destroyed in 
        the next  several  days.  Congress  is  thinking  about 
        eliminating  a  federal  program under which scientists 
        broadcast signals to alien  beings.  This  would  be  a 
        large  mistake.  Alien beings have atomic blaster death 
        cannons.  You cannot cut off their federal programs  as 
        if they were merely poor people.  

        I realize some of you may not believe that alien beings 
        exist.   But   how   else  can  you  explain  the  many 
        unexplained phenomena that people are always  sighting, 
        such  as lightning and flying saucers?  Oh,  I know the 
        authorities claim these sightings are  actually  caused 
        by  "weather  balloons," but that is a bucket of manure 
        if I ever heard one.  (That's just a figure of  speech, 
        of course.  I realize manure is silent.) 

        Answer  this  question honestly:  Have you,  or has any 
        member of your immediate family,  ever seen  a  weather 
        balloon?  Of  course  not.  Nobody  has.  Yet  if these 
        "authorities" were telling the truth,  the  skies  over 
        America   would   be   dark   with   weather  balloons.  
        Commercial aviation would be impossible.  Nevertheless, 
        the authorities trot out this tired old explanation, or 
        an even stupider one,  every time a  flying  saucer  is 
        sighted.  

        Wake  up,  America!  There  are  no  weather  balloons!  
        Those are alien beings!  They are all  around  us!  I'm 
        sure  most of you have seen the movie "E.T.," the story 
        of an alien who almost dies  when  he  falls  into  the 
        clutches  of  the American medical establishment but is 
        saved by pre-adolescent boys.  Everybody  believes  the 
        alien  is  a  fake,  a triumph of special effects.  But 
        watch the movie closely next time.  The alien is  real.  
        The  boys  are  fakes.  Real  pre-adolescent boys would 
        have beaten the alien to death with rocks.  

        Yes,  aliens exist.  And high government officials know 
        they exist, but they've been keeping this knowledge top 
        secret.  Here is the Untold Story: 

        Years  ago,  when  the  alien-broadcast  program began, 
        government scientists decided to  broadcast  a  message 
        that  would  be  simple  yet  convey  a  sense of love, 
        universal peace and brotherhood:  "Have  a  Nice  Day." 
        They  broadcast  this message over and over,  day after 
        day, year after year, until one day they got an answer:

               Dear Earth Persons:
                 OK.  We are having a nice day.  We also have a 
               number  of extremely sophisticated weapons,  and 
               unless you  start  broadcasting  something  more 
               interesting,  we  will  reduce  your planet to a 
               very warm object the size of a  child's  bowling 
               ball.  

                                             Regards,
                                             The Aliens


        So  the scientists,  desperate for something that would 
        interest the aliens,  broadcast an episode of  "I  Love 
        Lucy,"  and  the  aliens loved it.  They demanded more, 
        and soon they were getting all  three  major  networks, 
        and  the  earth  was saved.  There is only one problem: 
        The aliens have terrible taste.  They love game  shows, 
        soap  operas,  Howard  Cosell  and "Dallas." Whenever a 
        network tries to take one of these shows off  the  air, 
        the aliens threaten to vaporize the planet.  

        This  is  why you and all your friends think television 
        is so awful.  It isn't designed to please  you  -  it's 
        designed  to please creatures from another galaxy.  You 
        know the Wisk commercial,  the one with ring around the 
        collar,  the  one so spectacularly stupid that it makes 
        you wonder  why  anybody  would  dream  of  buying  the 
        product?  Well,  the  aliens  love that commercial.  We 
        all owe a great debt of gratitude  to  the  people  who 
        make  Wisk.  The  have not sold a single bottle of Wisk 
        in 14 years, but they have saved the Earth.  

        Very few people know any  of  this.  Needless  to  say, 
        Congress   has   no   idea  what  is  going  on.   Most 
        legislators are incapable of eating  breakfast  without 
        the help of several aides, so we can hardly expect them 
        to  understand  a serious threat from outer space.  But 
        if they go ahead with their plan to cancel  the  alien-
        broadcast  program and the aliens miss the next episode 
        of "General Hospital," what do you think  will  happen?  
        Think about it.  And have a nice day.

                            A new Fido Network
                              by Bob Hartman
                     Sysop 132/101 (formerly 101/101)


                As of Friday, September 20th, the UN*X Gateway
        Fido, and several others in New Hampshire have formed a
        new Fido network - NH_Net.  The affected boards are:

        UN*X Gateway   was Fido 101/101 now is Fido 132/101 or 132/0
        cLINE          was Fido 101/102 now is Fido 132/102
        M'Cycle Bytes  was Fido 101/107 now is Fido 132/107
        Revap Data     was Fido 101/388 now is Fido 132/388
        North Net      was Fido 101/444 now is Fido 132/444
        Alter-Net      was Fido 101/644 now is Fido 132/644
        Wizards Castle was Fido  16/615 now is Fido 132/615
        Spaghetti_heav was Fido  16/620 now is Fido 132/620

                Please use the new node numbers whenever you send
        mail.  Since the UN*X Gateway receives *LOTS* of mail, it
        should now be addressed to the new node number (132/101).
        Also, Rovermsg, Renum, and Filedate bugs should now be
        mailed to 132/101.  Thanks from all the nodes in net 132!

                           A Bit of Clarification

                         SYSOP FIDO 109/74 & 109/483

                In an article excerpted from the August 1985 issue 
        of DIGITAL REVIEW (it was reprinted with permission wasn't 
        it?), was a discussion fo the FIDO sessions presented at the 
        Fall 84 and Spring 85 DECUS Symposia.  As the speaker at 
        those sessions, I felt that a misconception expressed in 
        that article should be cleared up.  

                The first FIDO session was presented at the Fall 
        1985 DECUS, which was held in Anaheim, CA.  The session was 
        actually a Birds of a Feather (BOF) session, which was 
        scheduled at the symposium.  I had not been involved with 
        FIDO long enough to get together an abstract for a formal 
        session in time to meet the submission deadlines.  The room 
        it was held in was the same size room that all BOF sessions 
        are held in.  It would seat 50 people and was to be an hour 
        long.  Well, we had nearly 100 people in the room, with more 
        in the hall outside.  The session went to 1.5 hours before 
        we were thrown out by the next BOF session.  All in all a 
        very good session, with several FIDO systems spawned as a 
        result.  

                The second FIDO session was presented at the Spring 
        1985 DECUS which was held in New Orleans, LA.  This one was 
        a formal session of an hours duration.  Unfortunately, it 
        was scheduled immediately before an award ceremony that I 
        was supposed to be at, so the session was not able to run 
        over the alotted hour, and I was not able to field all of 
        the questions that I would have liked to.  Had about 150 in 
        attendance.  

                A third FIDO session is going to be held at the 
        upcoming DECUS which is being held in early December at the 
        Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim.  This session is to be 1.5 
        hours.  Hopefully there will be enough time to handle all 
        the questions.  In addition, Tom Jennings (anyone know who 
        he is?) is scheduled to do a "Pre-Symposium Seminar" before 
        the start of the actual symposium.  

                All in all, I would say that both DEC and DECUS have 
        been very, very good to us.  Also, I have never considered 
        myself to be a "spokesman" for FIDO, I just happen to like 
        to talk.

        The further adventures of Luke Vaxhacker         Episode n+1

            The story thus far: Luke, PDP-1, and their 'droids RS232 
        and  3CPU  have made good their escape from the Imperial Bus 
        Signals with the aid of Con Solo and the bookie,  Two Bacco.  
        The  Milliamp  Falcon  hurtles  onward through system space.  
        Meanwhile, on a distant page in user space...  

            Princess _LPA0:  was ushered into the  conference  room, 
        followed  closely  by  Dec  Vadic.  "Governor Tarchive," she 
        spat,  "I should have expected to find you  holding  Vadic's 
        lead.  I  recognized  your  unique  pattern when I was first 
        brought aboard." She eyed the 0177545 tatooed on his  header 
        coldly.  

            "Charming  to  the  last," Tarchive declared menacingly.  
        "Vadic, have you retrieved any information?" 

            "Her resistance to the  logic  probe  is  considerable," 
        Vadic  rasped.  "Perhaps  we  would get faster results if we 
        increased the supply voltage..." 

            "You've  had your chance,  Vadic".  Now I would like the 
        princess to witness the test that will make this workstation 
        fully operational.  Today we enable the -r beam option,  and 
        we've  chosen  the  princess'  $HOME of /usr/alderaan as the 
        primary target." 

            "No!  You can't! /usr/alderaan is a public account, with 
        no restricted permissions.  We have  no  backup  tapes!  You 
        can't..." 

            "Then name the rebel inode!" Tarchive snapped.  

            A  voice  announced  over a hidden speaker that they had 
        arrived in /usr.

            "1248,"  she  whispered,  "They're  on  /dev/rm3.  Inode 
        1248." She turned away.  

            Tarchive sighed with satisfaction.  "There, you see Lord 
        Vadic?  She can be reasonable. Proceed with the operation." 

            It took several clock cycles for the words to penetrate.  
        "What!" _LPA0: gasped.  

            "/dev/rm3  is  not  a  mounted   filesystem."   Tarchive 
        explained.   "We   require   a   more   visible  subject  to 
        demonstrate the power of the RM STAR  workstation.  We  will 
        mount an attack on /mnt/dantooine as soon as possible." 

            As the princess watched, Tarchive reached over and typed 
        "ls"  on a nearby terminal.  There was a brief pause,  there 
        being only  one  processor  on  board,  and  the  viewscreen 
        showed, ".: not found." 

            The princess suddenly double-spaced and went off-line.
