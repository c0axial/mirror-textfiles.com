                         When Practice becomes Policy
                                  Doug Myers

     Elections are in the news this week.  News on the Region 12 Election
     winds down with a poignant wish by Darrell Salter, the newly elected
     Regional Coordinator there.  The election in Region 13 kicks off
     with the posting of an election schedule by David Califranceso, the
     newly elected Election Coordinator there.  The R13 election was
     actually scheduled earlier this year, and nominations made, but the
     region decided to defer the election until after the Z1C election
     since David Moufarrege was a prime candidate in both elections.

     In the Region 13 Sysop echo, there's an interesting thread between
     Carol Shenkenberger (Acting RC13) and Bob Morasvik (noted Fidonet
     "Bad Boy").  Carol refers to the Region 13 Election Guidelines as a
     regional policy, and Bob takes exception to the term "policy" in
     this context.  Bob maintains that a policy, such as Fidonet Policy
     4.07, is something enforceable; something which the sysops cannot
     simply ignore.  He further maintains that no RC election policy is
     possible under P 4.07 because the position of RC is specifically
     spelled out as an appointment by the Zone Coordinator.  Under P
     4.97, the Zone Coordinator could simply ignore the vote within a
     region and appoint whomever he pleases.

     Carol points out that Bob's criteria of unenforceability is unlikely
     to have practical impact because David Moufarrege is a known
     proponent of elections in Fidonet, and is unlikely to reject an
     elected candidate.  It doesn't matter, argues Bob.  The fact that
     the "local" policy cannot bind the ZC invalidates it as a policy.
     Elections throughout Fidonet are little more than straw polls, and
     the "policies" defining them are little more than wish lists.

     As a tribute to his debating skills, Bob has a point.  But I wonder
     if, in making it he hasn't sealed the fate of all policy.  Could the
     ZC refuse an elected candidate from a region where elections have
     become a tradition?  Certainly printed policy says he can do this,
     but could he actually do this in practice?  Would the reaction of
     the sysops in Fidonet be sufficiently strong to enforce the
     application of tradition?  Could a ZC effectively withstand such a
     reaction?  If not, then the written policy becomes unenforceable, and
     by Bob's definition, P 4.07 ceases to exist as policy.  It may be
     that we're already at this point since David actively supports
     elections and will not (in my opinion) reject the outcome of an
     election.

     At what point does practice become policy?  At what point does
     written policy become invalid, and cease to exist as policy?

     * Forwarded (from: R13SYSOP) by David Calafrancesco
     * Originally from David Calafrancesco (1:2624/306) to all.
     * Original dated: Nov 17 '99, 00:00

     As per the current R13 election guidelines (or as close as we will
     be able to achieve in the spirit of the document given some
     technical problems like different echo names and missed dates etc),
     I would like to announce the start of our selection process to
     determine the next Regional Coordinator for Region 13.

     The schedule below has been modified from the absolute dates listed
     in the original document.

           1. Announcement of the election: -- November 18th through
              November 28th

           2. Declarations of Candidacy: November 29th through December
              12th
              b. Two weeks are allowed for such declarations

           3. Questions to the Candidates: December 13th through January
              9th
              d. Three weeks are allowed for questions and answers

           4. Vote: January 10th through January 19th
              One week is allowed for all members of the region to vote

     The beginning dates are not absolute, however the ending dates are
     firm unless we have some catastrophic network failure (like a two
     week ice storm or something). This means that if someone wishes to
     jump the gun on a nomination it will be OK. Same for questions to
     the candidates or votes. Candidates may decline to respond to
     questions until the question phase starts but are free to respond
     early if they desire.

     I have extended dates around the holidays to accomodate people's
     travel plans etc. There was no way to have the election end before
     the holidays so I set the dates to have things end well after New
     Years. We certainly don't need to have major chaos in the nodelist
     during the Y2K transition so having the election ending mid January
     is preferred. I also expect a one or two week transition period
     after the final results are posted. Note that the ending date for
     this term for the RC should stay on the October schedule (October
     2001).

     For the duration of this election, the valid echos for
     announcements, nominations, questions etc... will be R13SYSOP and
     R13_ELECTION. Announcements will be made in both, discussion can
     take place in either. Candidates are instructed to monitor both
     echos equally and to cross post any platforms or other mass
     announcements into R13SYSOP.

     Votes will be accepted by almost any method that will get them to
     me. I plan to use a vote counting robot that will have a flexible
     format for sending in the votes. Netmail (routed or otherwise) or
     internet email will both have the same result as they end up in the
     exact same *.msg netmail folder. Votes will be the usual format,
     identify yourself (name and nodenumber), who you are voting for, and
     a keyword. The results will be tallied and reported by use of the
     keyword so choose something that will likely be unique. The
     relationship between you and your keyword is as private as you wish
     to make it. A list of nodes that have voted will also be published
     allowing people to track who is or is not voting.

     The robot will hopefully be instructed to post nightly lists of the
     nodes that have voted so everyone can check to ensure that their
     vote has been counted.

     The robot also has an interesting feature in that it allows a voter
     to change their mind. Only the last vote received for any node is
     accepted. It also has the ability to deal with slight mispellings of
     a candidates name.

     Should anyone have any questions, I can be reached at any of the
     following methods:

     1:2624/306 (preferred) or any of my other AKAs including the 1:13/2
     that should be in the nodelist next week. All correspondance can
     also be sent via email to r13electmod@drakkar.org

     Nice 'snooze'.

     Yeah, it was quite the election, and one that I thought would never
     end. Anyone that has followed Region 12 elections in the past
     usually finds them quite entertaining, but this one was really
     different. For me, this was the second time I had thrown my hat in
     the ring, while I believe it was Steve's first. Steve and I ran
     FIDONEWS 16-47               Page 4                   22 Nov 1999


     good, clean campaigns. No backbiting, slander, namecalling, and no
     real campaigning. It seems we were both content to just let the
     chips fall where they may. Steve would have made a fine R12C, and I
     hope he'll be around for the next one. My "win" was dubious at best,
     and Steve suffered being screwed over twice actually, once by Shawn,
     and finally by Mike. Immediately following Mike's declaration of me
     a the new R12C, I asked the Region if they wanted to do it again to
     get it right, but the general concensus was, nah, let it be, carry
     on. Even Steve didn't want to contest it, although he certainly had
     every right to. He was a class-act all the way, and my hat goes off
     to him.

     So here I sit, learning a new job, and hoping things get back to
     normal (whatever that is).  :-)

     Regards,
     Darrell

                            Engineering and Humor
                                  by Ol'WDB

     Creative engineers are using an old tool in a new way to reengineer
     the organizational functions and father development of old Entities.
     I think Fidonet falls into that category as technology is fast
     eliminating the need for it, and the usefulness of Fido to the
     masses is declining.

     Development and implementation of a new framework is necessary for
     Fido to survive in the next millennium.  So let us look at the new
     innovative possibilities to resurrect and reconstruct a great hobby
     that served a great public need the past decade or so.

     My limited engineering knowledge was in the Video and Sound fields,
     a very narrow area in the total engineering spectrum.  All
     engineering fields are built upon a frame work of knowledge about
     the behavior of materials of every known medium and application.
     Organizations large and small depend on team work to accomplish the
     development of the product, the marketing and sales of their
     efforts.

     Ladies and gentlemen, Fidonet is no different then Mother Bell or
     her big sister AT&T.  In fact, all three have a lot in common,
     (chuckle) and there in lies the basic frame work needed for a happy
     successful use of a hobby to enhance our enjoyment of life and help
     the whole world.

     One of the many tools used in engineering is the languages of the
     entire world to one degree or another as applicable to the location
     and project.  Language in the form of text is the primary tool of
     Fidonet.  It can be used in many ways and is quite flexible in most
     general applications. It conveys powerful images, sounds and
     feelings.  Those who are real engineers in the use of it are
     Journalists by degree, and those of us that try to utilize it are
     not always successful.

     Now to the question: Why, as it relates to Fidonet's troubles?

     To find the answer to that question, a team of engineers would be
     assigned specific fields according to talent and degree, to
     assimilate every word, dotting all "i's" and crossing all "t's" in
     both cases, applying all known rules of the languages that make up
     the network of Fido.

     Then they would run the result through their individual programs and
     post their findings on the units "scratch board" for final
     collective analyses.  Then all of the individual papers would be
     developed and the resulting algorithm <+AP4-h+SS-T/pB2 > was
     compiled , the answer was determined in these words in succession of
     degree:

     FIDONEWS 16-47               Page 6                   22 Nov 1999


     +Antiquated P4, -humorB2, +Sh*t stirrers, -Truth, / Procrastination
     is the answer.

     To effect an increase in teamwork, empower each sysop/node with a
     positive sense of humor, a warm body vote in all elections,
     dramatically increasing their creative abilities to recruit others;
     and by the disposition of the negative procrastination propensities.

     In a friendlier Fido, all fights would be avoided voluntarily,
     leaders would be anxious to extend a helping hand to beginners again
     without making the puppies feel like ignorant idiots. That was the
     way Fido grew and the only way it will grow again.

                            Ice Cream for the Soul
                               Thanks to Ol'WDB

     Last week I took my children to a restaurant. My six-year old son
     asked if he could say grace. As we bowed our heads, he said, "God is
     great, God is good. Thank you for the food and I would even thank
     you more if Mom gets us ice cream for dessert. And liberty and
     justice for all! Amen."

     Along with laughter from the other customers nearby, I heard a woman
     remark, "That's what's wrong with this country. Kids today don't
     even know how to pray. Asking God for ice cream!  Why, I never!"

     Hearing this, my son burst into tears and asked me, "Did I do it
     wrong?  Is God mad at me?" As I held him and assured him that he had
     done a terrific job and God was certainly not mad at him, an elderly
     gentleman approached the table.

     He winked at my son and said, "I happen to know that God thought
     that was a great prayer."

     "Really?" my son asked.

     "Cross my heart."

     Then, in a theatrical whisper, the gentleman added (indicating the
     woman whose remark had started this whole thing), "Too bad she never
     asks God for ice cream. A little ice cream is good for the soul
     sometimes."

     Naturally, I bought my kids ice cream at the end of the meal. My son
     stared at his for a moment and then did something I will remember
     the rest of my life.

     He picked up his sundae and, without a word, walked over and placed
     it in front of the woman. With a big smile he told her, "Here, this
     is for you. Ice cream is good for the soul sometimes, and my soul
     is already good."

                              Politically Astute
                              Thanks to Roy Reed
                               rcreedv@juno.com


     A little boy goes to his dad and asks, "What's politics?" Dad says,
     "Well son, let me try to explain it this way: I'm the breadwinner of
     the family, so let's call me Capitalism. Your Mom, she's the
     administrator of the money, so we'll call her the Government.  We're
     here to take care of your needs, so we'll call you the People. The
     nanny, we'll consider her the Working Class. Now your baby brother,
     FIDONEWS 16-47               Page 11                  22 Nov 1999


     we'll call him the Future. Now, think about that and see if that
     makes sense."

     So the little boy goes off to bed thinking about what Dad has said.
     Later that night, he hears his baby brother crying, so he gets up to
     check on him.  He finds that the baby has severely soiled his
     diaper. So the little boy goes to his parents' room and finds his
     mother sound asleep. Not wanting to wake her, he goes to the nanny's
     room. Finding the door locked, he peeks in the keyhole and sees his
     father in bed with the nanny. He gives up and goes back to bed. The
     next morning, the little boy says to his father, "Dad, I think I
     understand the concept of politics now." The father says, "Good son,
     tell me in your own words what you think politics is all about."

     The little boy replies,  "Well, while Capitalism is screwing the
     Working Class, the Government is sound asleep, the People are being
     ignored and the Future is in deep shit."
