     Subj: FTSC Nominations Re-opened

     Chris,

     Please publish the below message in the upcoming FidoNews.  Thank you.


                       Submitted to FidoNews this date
                               by Bruce Bodger

                          FTSC NOMINATIONS RE-OPENED


     Adrian Walker and I have discussed the plans for the FTSC election and
     we have decided that for several reasons we would delay the vote until
     01 August 97;

     1.  Both of us are going to be extremely busy, and unable to give this
         our full attention for the next few weeks.

     2.  It is clear to us that there are several more nominations "waiting
         in the wings" which missed the earlier nomination period.

     3.  We will shortly be into the summer vacation period, and delaying
         the vote a short while will avoid much of that.

                               ====================
                               NOMINATIONS REOPENED
                               ====================

     Effective immediately, nominations for Standing Members have been
     reopened.

     For reference, here are the details of the nomination process:

          FTSC members are appointed for a two year renewable term.  [50 %
          of appointments on initial formation of the FTSC shall be for a 3
          year renewable term, to ensure continuity of the Committee on
          expiry of the terms.]

          To be selected as a FTSC member, an individual must be a Fidonet
          node, and should be actively involved in Fidonet. Examples
          include having put out a Fidonet-related product or having
          updated a product in the preceding two years, or having
          experience as a Coordinator, Echomail Coordinator or mail or file
     FIDONEWS 14-21               Page 3                   26 May 1997


          Hub.

          Standing members may be nominated Fidonet-wide by all of the
          following methods:

          1.  any RC or REC
          2.  a nominating committee established for the purpose by the
              FTSC
          3.  a nominating committee established for the purpose by the
              ZCC

                                ===============
                                ACTION REQUIRED
                                ===============

     Since there is no nominating committee at this stage, those persons
     interested in becoming a Standing Member of the FTSC should state
     their interest to any currently-serving RC or REC and request that the
     RC or REC nominate them either by message in the FTSC_PUBLIC echo, or
     by netmail to Bruce Bodger (1:170/400), who is administering the
     nomination list.

     The closing date for such applications to be an active Standing Member
     of the FTSC will be Friday 01 August 1997.  At that time a list of all
     applicants having been properly nominated will be published, and the
     voting process will then be followed as defined in FTA-1001.

     Subj: It can't work?

      * Original to: Clay Tannacore (1:372/4)

     Hi, Clay;

     I am sitting here reading your letter in FidoNews, and the thought
     strikes me that no matter WHAT happens in the politics of FidoNet,
     _ALL_ of the private nets - FidoNet, MufoNet and the rest), are very
     ill because of a virus.  That virus is Internetitus!

     I am so damn sick and tired of all the political "campaigning," (read
     that as "Mud-slinging"), crap in FN_SYSOP that I dropped the echo.  (I
     turned it on again, but only because of the INTBBS_WEEK echo which we
     are trying to get started, and the International BBS week which is
     being planned.)

     If we cannot get some publicity for our BBSes and recruit new systems
     into the nets, FidoNet and all the rest will become nothing more than
     a memory in some oldtimer's mind - a story to be told on some obscure
     home page somewhere, a reference in an old book on the history of the
     Internet.

     When that happens, and we are headed that way just as surely as if the
     phone company went out of business, please tell me what will all the
     politics, the name calling, the hard feelings, the high blood pressure
     of the current election matter?

     Have you read the message I posted which started the INTBBS_WEEK idea?
     If not, I will be more than happy to send you a copy!  From where _I_
     sit, the network's political issues won't make a penny's worth of
     difference when the last BBS pulls the plug for the last time.

     When we, (FidoNet SysOps in several European countries including
     Holland), get INTBBS_WEEK on the North American backbone, PLEASE get
     it and participate, ok?

     I am excited about it and you will be too!

     Catch you later... Let's keep the nets alive!

     Lock and Load: Guerilla Marketing for BBSes
     Robert Parson (1:3822/1)

     I had fully intended there to be a column last week.  Time grabbed me
     by the lapel and wouldn't let go.  Which is why I don't envy Editor
     Chris Baker.  Onward:


     The first thing to remember about reporters is that they are not the
     enemy.

     Yes, the general image of BBSes within the media has been tarnished.
     But with proper cleaning that image can be shiny.  We've talked about
     News Releases, but that's the easy part.  The hard part comes when a
     reporter calls to interview you.

     As you can tell, I put a lot of emphasis on News Releases.  Most are
     thrown away.  But some really do result in news stories and some are
     filed away for future reference.  Keep sending out those news releases
     and you will eventually become The Expert in the field.

     At first, you came to the media because you have something you want to
     say.  But now, they are coming to you because you have something that
     they want to know.

     Rule number one:  Return your calls.  I know that sounds rather
     obvious, but you'd be amazed at how many news sources don't return
     phone calls.

     Rule number two:  Don't lie.  If you get caught, you'll get nailed to
     the wall.  If you accidentally pass along some incorrect information,
     admit it at the first opportunity.  Rule number two-and-a-half: Don't
     buffalo your way through something you don't know.  If you don't know,
     refer the reporter to someone who does know.  Sure it may mean less
     press for you, but that's better than being perceived as a fool.

     Rule number three:  If the reporter is coming to see you, be neatly
     groomed.  That doesn't mean you have to wear a suit and tie.  Just
     don't look like you fell off a train.

     If you know and understand those three basic rules, you'll get along
     rather well with reporters.  But there are some gaps to fill in.

     Some interviews will simply be conducted on the phone.  A reporter may
     call to get some information on a breaking story, or get more
     information on the news release you sent him/her.

     Be patient.  Reporters are representative of the public as a whole.
     They use computers at work, they are comfortable with them, but for
     the most part they don't go beyond what is required for them to know.
     They aren't techno-phobic, but they aren't going out their way to
     FIDONEWS 14-21               Page 7                   26 May 1997


     learn everything they can, either.  Chances are the average reporter
     knows enough about computer communications to log onto the internet,
     grab e-mail, send a reply, and check into a couple news-oriented
     Websites.  You may have to lead them through some issues.  My favorite
     analogy is "If you can drive a car, you can drive a computer."

     Visual aids are always nifty.  TV reporters like lots of movement.
     Give them lights blinking on a modem, animated ANSI, messages
     scrolling up the screen.  Anything that conveys motion.  For print
     journalists, a few static screen shots and a picture of you doing some
     work.  If you have a room full of computers, a modem pool or whatever,
     they're usually quite happy about having pictures of tech-stuff from
     floor to ceiling.

     The entire time you are talking with a reporter, maintain your
     professional image.  You can still be casual, but you are serious
     about your work as a Sysop. Don't lose your head on controversial
     topics.

     Which brings me to this point:  If a reporter comes with an agenda
     don't get angry with him/her.  Acknowledge that agenda.  You read that
     right.  But you have the opportunity to amend the agenda, and possibly
     even change it.  "Porn on BBSes?  Yes.  But it is no more prevalent
     than it is in the community at large.  Here, check out this Missing
     Children's Echo..."

     Always find some way to cast a negative issue in a positive light.
     And never pass up the opportunity to invite someone to call your BBS.

     What do BBSes and Newspapers have in common?  We'll talk about that in
     two weeks.

            Distributed File Requests:  What Are They?
            ------------------------------------------

              DFREQ programs are designed to allow both sysops and  users
              to  make Distributed File Requests from other  BBS  systems
              listed in FidoNet<tm> or compatible nodelists.   There  are
              several major differences between Distributed File  Request
              methodology (hereafter referred to as DFREQ)  and  existing
              FidoNet FREQ and/or file distribution formats.

              FidoNet file request technology was designed only  for  the
              direct  transmittal of file requests  from  one  system  to
              another.   DFREQ technology allows routing of file requests
              from  the  originating  system  along  a  user-configurable
              "chain" of systems,   ending at  the  target  node.    This
              methodology  allows the setup of  no-cost,   local  routing
              paths for  file requests between distant systems that would
              normally  incur long-distance phone charges.

            How DFREQs Work
            ---------------

              Distributed File Request methodology can be separated  into
              2 main parts-- the REQUEST and the ACKNOWLEDGEMENT.

     FIDONEWS 14-21               Page 9                   26 May 1997


              The  REQUEST represents the initial stage,  in which  DFREQ
              data  from the originating system has not yet  reached  its
              target,  and thus carries no accompanying  requested  files
              with  it.   DFREQ data may be relayed via file  or  netmail
              message attach through any number of  intermediate  systems
              on its way to its ultimate target,  which is defined by the
              contents  of the request  file.   The  path  taken  by  the
              request to its target is determined by routing data used by
              the DFREQ processors of participating nodes in the chain.

              The ACKNOWLEDGEMENT is the result of a  processed  request,
              and  is created whether or  not  the  requested  files  are
              available  at the target  system.   The  DFREQ  information
              formerly  carried by the request  is  used  to  create  the
              acknowledgement,  set   its   destination   back   to   the
              originating system, file- or netmail-attach requested files
              (if any) for transmission, and/or provide information as to
              why  requested  file(s)  were  unavailable  at  the  target
              system.  Request data is deleted by the target system after
              the  acknowledgement is created.   The path  taken  by  the
              acknowledgement  back  to  the  originating  system   again
              depends upon the routing configurations of the chain nodes,
              but need not be the same as the path  previously  travelled
              by the request.

              ASCII  text files are used to transport  DFREQ  information
              between nodes.  These carrier files are similar in form and
              function to the .TIC files used by the TICK<tm>  file  echo
              utility.

              The DFREQ process starts when a user generates a  DFR  file
              containing  file request information,  using the  local  or
              on-line mode of a DFREQ processor.

            DFR Files
            ---------

              DFREQ  data for the REQUEST stage is  transmitted  using  a
              file with a .DFR (Distributed File Request) extension.  The
              filename is a randomly-generated 8-digit number.  DFR files
              carry  information  on  the  net/node  of  the  originating
              system, net/node of the target system, the name of the user
              who originated the request,  the filenames and descriptions
              of  the files to be requested,  the path travelled  by  the
              request  on its way to the  target  system,  and  date/time
              stamps  indicating when the request was processed  by  each
              node in the path.  DFRs are transmitted via file or netmail
              message attach.

            DFA Files
            ---------

              DFREQ  data for the ACKNOWLEDGEMENT  phase  is  transmitted
              using a file with a .DFA (Distributed File Acknowledgement)
              extension.   The  8-digit  filename   of   the   previously
              processed  DFR request file is retained.   DFA files  carry
     FIDONEWS 14-21               Page 10                  26 May 1997


              information  on the  net/node  of  the  originating  system
              (formerly the target system in the DFR file),  the net/node
              of  the target system (formerly the originating  system  in
              the  DFR file),  the name of the  user  who  generated  the
              request,  the filenames and  descriptions  of  successfully
              requested  files,  and the filenames and  associated  error
              information for any unsuccessfully requested or unavailable
              files.   The full  path  information  from  the  previously
              processed DFR file is retained,  and is appended with  path
              and  datestamp information representing the travel  of  the
              DFA file back to its new target, the source of the original
              DFREQ.  DFAs are transmitted via file or netmail attach.

            Error Messages
            --------------

              When  requests for any or all files in a DFREQ can  not  be
              fulfilled  for some  reason,  information  as  to  why  the
              request  was not satisfied is included  in  the  DFA  file,
              replacing the file descriptions of the  unavailable  files.
              Reasons for file unavailability can include:

               o  File(s) not found or not available at target system

               o  OKFile path does not exist on target system

               o  File(s) not found in inbound area-- node xxx/xxx

              DFA  files may be appended with error  information  by  any
              processing  system in the chain  back  to  the  originating
              node, depending upon where the error condition occurs.

            DFR/DFA File Formats
            --------------------

              DFR and DFA files are ASCII text files that transport DFREQ
              information between systems.   The DFR file is used  during
              the REQUEST stage of the transaction.  The DFA file is used
              during the ACKNOWLEDGEMENT stage of the transaction.

              New  DFR files are created by the DFREQ processor using its
              local  or on-line user  mode.   A  random  8-digit  numeric
              filename and .DFR extension are assigned to the file.  File
              format for a newly-created DFR is shown below:

              script

              The first line of the DFR holds information identifying the
              program/version  used to create it.   No empty  spaces  are
              allowed above this line,  or between any of the lines  that
              follow.

              The  second line of the DFR  contains  Origin  information.
              This  indicates the net/node number  of  the  system  which
              generated the DFR.

              The third line of the DFR contains  Requestor  information.
              This provides the name of the user who initiated the DFREQ.

              The  fourth line of the DFR  contains  Target  information.
              This indicates the net/node number of the system  which  is
              to  receive the DFR and process  it  to  deliver  requested
              files.

              All  lines beginning with  the  "File"  identifier  contain
              filename and description information taken from remote file
              lists.   Filenames and descriptions must be separated by at
              least one space.  No empty lines are allowed after File
              information.

              When  a DFR  is  sent  to  another  system,  that  system's
              net/node information is appended to it, along with date and
              time  stamp  information  indicating  when  the   DFR   was
              processed by the system.   This information accompanies the
              DFR  throughout its entire journey.   A DFR file with  Path
              information appended to it is shown below:

              script
              Path        141/507   15 Nov 92 07:40:31

              Information contained within the DFR file  above  indicates
              it  has already traveled through  the  intermediate  system
              141/507  on its way from Origin system  141/545  to  Target
              system 141/455.  No empty lines are allowed after Path
              information.

              When  a DFR file reaches  its  Target  destination,  it  is
              converted  into a DFA  file,  and  its  file  requests  are
              evaluated by the target system.  Conversion of DFRs to DFAs
              is  done by retaining the DFR filename,  changing the  .DFR
              extension  to .DFA,  and reversing Origin and Target  data.
              Thus,  a DFR file originally named 12345678.DFR from Origin
              141/545 for Target 141/455 becomes 12345678.DFA from Origin
              141/455 for Target 141/545, as shown below:

              Note the dual Path lines for the Target system.   The first
              line represents processing as a DFR,  the second represents
              processing as a DFA.

              The  successfully-processed DFA file  is  returned  to  the
              system  that  originated  the   DFREQ,   along   with   the
              accompanying  requested file.   The  DFA  as  received  and

                     ENCRYPTED MESSAGE IDENTIFICATION FOR FIDONET

                             FIDONET TECHNICAL COMMENT

                                Author :  John Mudge
                                Fido   :  1:352/111
                                Date   :  25FEB1993

     ABSTRACT:

     The following document proposes a standard for encrypted message
     identification for Fidonet and Fidonet-based electronic mail
     systems.

     The proposed standard will assist in encrypted-message detection.
     The standard consists of mandatory and suggested portions; however
     the term "mandatory" does not mean that any Fidonet product must
     implement this standard; it simply means that those that do claim to
     implement this standard must do so in the way described.

     STATUS OF THIS DOCUMENT:

     This FSC suggests a proposed protocol for the Fidonet(R) community,
     and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
     Distribution of this document is unlimited.

     Fido and Fidonet are registered marks of Tom Jennings and Fido
     Software.

     BACKGROUND:

     Currently, Fidonet encrypted messages are not uniquely identified.  A
     variety of schemes are in place to determine whether a message
     received by a Fidonet node has been encrypted, but all of them involve
     encryption method specific tests.  Current Fido Policy (Policy4)
     prohibits routing encrypted material through systems which have not
     given specific prior approval.  This FSC proposes a method of
     identifying such traffic, but makes no effort to determine what action
     should be taken after the identification.

     IFNA KLUDGE LINES:

     Fidonet supports a general method for sending additional information
     embedded in a message known as the "IFNA kludge line".  This is a line
     of text beginning with the ASCII SOH character (^A).  The characters
     following SOH are a word indicating the type of kludge line, and the
     remainder of the line contains information specific to that type.
     This standard introduces a new type of kludge line, the ENC.

     FORMAT OF A MESSAGE ID - MANDATORY:

     The mandatory portion of the ^AENC line shall consist of the Ascii SOH
     character immediately followed by the uppercase characters ENC and a

     FORMAT OF A MESSAGE ID - SUGGESTED:

     It is suggested, though not required, that the unique part of all
     ^AENC lines consist of a unique product identifier following the same
     format as specified in FSC-0046 for ^APID kludge lines and identifying
     the program used for encryption.  This product identifier will allow
     message editors to invoke the appropriate decryption software.

     EXAMPLE:

     ^AENC: PGP2.1
     with PGP21 to be replaced with a two digit hex identifier at such time
     as a central product registry exists.

     IMPLEMENTATIONS:

     As of this writing, several products are being written, notably by
     Fredric Rice and GK Pace, to implement this proposal.  Examples of
     currently available programs are GENMSG V1.30 and PGP-TOSS.

     SUMMARY:

     As of this date, no public repository exists for encryption/decryption
     product registration, but the FTSC is suggested as is the application
     form presented in FSC-0022.

     I am publishing this information as a Fidonet technical comment in
     hopes that other Fidonet products will eventually incorporate all or
     part of this standard as well, and that it will eventually form part
     of a Fidonet Technical Standard.

     CREDITS:

     I would like to thank all of the pioneers of Fidonet for making all of
     this possible.  The ^AENC proposal is the result of the collective
     efforts of many of the participants of the Fido PUBLIC_KEYS echo.
     Much of the wording and structure for this document I stole from
     authors of previous FSC authors.  Special thanks go to GK Pace and
     Fredric Rice for their ongoing programming efforts in support of
     public-key encryption systems.

                              ECHOMAIL DEFINED

       EchoMail is a technique that permits several nodes on a
       network to share a message base. It is similar in concept to
       the conferences available on commercial information services
       but is most closely related to the Usenet system consisting of
       thousands of systems world wide.  All systems sharing a given
       conference see any messages entered into the conference by any
       of the participating systems.  This can be implemented in such
       a way as to be totally transparent to the users of a
       particular system.  In fact, they may not even be aware of the
       network being used to move their messages about from node to
       node!

       Unfortunately, EchoMail has disadvantages as well.  Many users
       who are not educated about EchoMail systems do not realize the
       messages transmitted cost MANY sysops (system operators)
       money, not just the local sysop.  This is an important
       consideration in EchoMail and should not be taken lightly.  In
       a conference with 100 systems participating the cost per
       message can be quite high.

                         BRIEF HISTORY OF ECHOMAIL

       In late 1985, Jeff Rush, a Fido sysop in Dallas, wanted a
       convenient means of sharing ideas with the other Dallas
       sysops.  He created a system of programs he called Echomail,
       and the Dallas sysops' Conference was born.

       Within a short time sysops in other areas began hearing of
       this marvelous new gadget and EchoMail took on a life of its
       own.  Today the FidoNet public network boasts a myriad of
     FIDONEWS 14-21               Page 16                  26 May 1997


       conferences varying in size from a handful of participants to
       Sysop conferences with hundreds of participants.  It is not
       uncommon for a system to carry hundreds or more conferences
       and share those conferences with 10 or more nodes.

                             HOW ECHOMAIL WORKS

       Today's EchoMail processing is functionally compatible with
       the original EchoMail utilities.  In general, the process is:

         -  A message is entered into a designated area on a FidoNet
            compatible system.

         -  This message is "Exported" along with some 'control
            information' to each system "linked" to the conference
            through the originating system.

         -  Each receiving system "Imports" the message into the
            proper Conference Mail area.

         -  The receiving systems then "Export" these messages, along
            with additional control information, to each of their own
            EchoMail links.

         -  Return to the import step.

       The method is quite simple in general.  Of course, following
       the steps literally means messages would never stop being
       Exported and transmitted to other systems.  This obviously
       would not be desired.  The information contained in the
       'control information' section is used to prevent exporting the
       same message more than once to a single system.

                        MESSAGE CONTROL INFORMATION

       Control information is associated with each EchoMail message.
       This information consists of certain special lines placed
       inside the message.  These lines are typically inserted
       automatically by the program which prepares or processes the
       message, not by the person writing it.

       In FTS-0001 terminology, these control information lines shall
       be inside the "text" field of a "packed message".

       Control information lines shall contain only ASCII characters,
       from 32 to 126, except the first character of the path line
       and as noted elsewhere in this document.  This limitation
       applies only to control information lines.

       Alphabetic characters in required literal strings (AREA,
       Origin, SEEN-BY, and PATH) are case-sensitive.

       All control information lines shall be terminated with ASCII
       character 13 (carriage return).

       These required control information lines determine how
     FIDONEWS 14-21               Page 17                  26 May 1997


       EchoMail is handled:

       1. Area line

       There shall be exactly one area line in an exported message.
       The AREA line:

         -  Shall be the first line of the text and thus shall
            immediately follow the packed message header.  This
            position is "offset 0" of the "text" portion of the
            packed message.

         -  Shall be formatted as:

                 AREA:CONFERENCE

                 AREA: is a required five character upper case
                 literal.

                 CONFERENCE is the name of the conference. The
                 conference name is composed of ASCII characters in
                 the range 33 to 96 and 123 to 126.  The conference
                 name shall be no more than 60 characters in length.

       The AREA line is added when a conference is "Exported" to
       other systems.  It is based upon information found in a
       configuration file for the designated message area.  This
       field is used by receiving systems to "Import" messages into
       the correct EchoMail area.

       Some implementations insert a Ctrl-A (0x01) immediately
       preceding the AREA: literal (^AAREA:CONFERENCE).

       Six months after adoption of this document the ^AAREA: format
       shall be processed equally with the AREA: format when either
       occurs in received packets.

       2. Origin Line

       There shall be exactly one origin line in a message.  It shall
       be placed in the message following all user entered
       information and immediately before the remaining control
       information lines.

       The origin line:

         -  Shall begin with the eleven character literal:

                 <space>*<space>Origin:<space>

         -  Is optionally followed by user/system defined data in the
            ASCII range 32 to 126.

         -  Shall end with a FidoNet network address enclosed in
            parenthesis:

     FIDONEWS 14-21               Page 18                  26 May 1997


                 ([<zone>:]<net>/<node>[.<point>][@<domain>])

         -  Shall be no more than 79 characters long including the
            required lead-in and address information.

         -  Shall be inserted into the message at the originating
            system.

       The complete line might look like:

                 * Origin: Conference Mail BBS (1:132/101)

       3. Seen-by Lines

       Seen-by lines are the focus of EchoMail distribution control
       information.  They are used to determine which addresses
       (systems) have received messages.  There can be as many seen-
       by lines as required to store the necessary information.

       Seen-by lines consist of "SEEN-BY:<space>", followed by a list
       of net/node numbers corresponding to the systems which have
       received that message.  The net/node number of each system to
       which a message is exported is added to the seen-by lines at
       the time of export.

       There shall be exactly one set of seen-by lines in a message.
       Seen-by lines:

         -  Shall follow the origin line.

         -  Shall begin with the nine character literal:

                 SEEN-BY:<space>

         -  Shall contain a list of net/node numbers.

         -  Shall be no more than 80 characters long including the
            required literal.

       The complete lines might look like:

                 SEEN-BY: 104/1 501 132/101 113 136/601 1014/1
                 SEEN-BY: 1014/2 3

       The list of net/node numbers:

         -  Shall identify at least one address. "Blank" seen-by
            lines shall not be transmitted.

         -  Shall be sorted in ascending net/node order.

         -  Shall not contain repeated node numbers.

         -  Shall use only "2D" net/node notation.

         -  May use short form address notation where a net number is
     FIDONEWS 14-21               Page 19                  26 May 1997


            listed once on any one line.  These 2 lines are
            equivalent:

                 SEEN-BY: 104/1 104/501 132/101 132/113 136/601
                 SEEN-BY: 104/1 501 132/101 113 136/601

       Some implementations insert a Ctrl-A (0x01) immediately
       preceding the SEEN-BY: literal (^ASEEN-BY:).

       Six months after adoption of this document the ^ASEEN-BY:
       format shall be processed equally with the SEEN-BY: format
       when either occurs in received packets.

       4. Path Lines

       Path lines identify a list of net/node numbers that processed
       a message before it reached the current system.  There can be
       as many path lines as required to store the necessary
       information.

       This is different from seen-by lines, in that seen-by lines
       list list all systems to which the message has been sent while
       path lines list the systems which have processed the message.

       There shall be exactly one set of path lines in a message.
       Path lines:

         -  Shall follow seen-by lines.

         -  Shall be the last line(s) in the text field of a packed
            message.

         -  Shall begin with the seven character literal:

                 ^APATH:<space>

            The ^A is a special character which stands for Control-A
            (ASCII character 1), and is required at the beginning of
            each path line.

         -  Shall contain a list of net/node numbers.

         -  Shall be no more than 80 characters long including the
            required literal.

       The complete path line might look like:

                 ^APATH: 132/101 1014/1

       The list of net/node numbers:

         -  Shall identify at least one net/node number.  "Blank"
            path lines shall not be transmitted.

         -  Shall not be sorted.  They shall remain in the order
            representing the actual "path" along which the message
     FIDONEWS 14-21               Page 20                  26 May 1997


            traveled.

         -  Shall use only "2D" net/node notation.

         -  Shall begin with the net/node of the originating system.

         -  Shall not be deleted during processing.  The original
            path information shall be maintained from origin to final
            destination.

                             ECHOMAIL TOPOLOGY

       The way in which systems link together for a particular
       conference is called the "EchoMail Topology."  It is important
       to know this structure for two reasons:

         -  It is important to have a topology which is efficient in
            the transfer of the EchoMail messages.

         -  It is important to have a topology which will not cause
            systems to see the same messages more than once.

       Efficiency can be measured in a number of ways:

         -  Least time involved for all systems to receive a message

         -  Least cost for all systems to receive a message

         -  Fewest phone calls required for all systems to receive a
            message.

       Users of EchoMail systems have determined (through trial and
       error) the best measure of efficiency to be a combination of
       all three measurements.  Balancing the equation is not
       trivial, but some guidelines can be offered:

         -  Have nodes form "stars" for distribution of EchoMail.
            This arrangement has several nodes all receiving their
            EchoMail from the same system.  In general the systems on
            the "outside" of the star poll the system on the
            "inside".  The system on the "inside" in turn polls other
            systems in a similar star configuration to receive the
            EchoMail that is being passed on to the "outside"
            systems.

         -  Utilize fully connected polygons with few vertices.
            Nodes can be connected in a triangle (A sends to B and C,
            B sends to A and C, C sends to A and B) or a fully
            connected square (all corners of the square send to all
            of the other corners).  This method is useful for getting
            EchoMail messages to each node as quickly as possible.

       All of these efficiency guidelines have to be tempered with
       the guidelines dealing with keeping duplicate messages from
       being exported.  Duplicates will occur in any topology that
       forms a closed polygon that is not fully connected.  Take for
     FIDONEWS 14-21               Page 21                  26 May 1997


       example the following configuration:

                 A ----- B
                 |       |
                 |       |
                 C ----- D

       This square is a closed polygon that is not fully connected.
       It is capable of generating duplicates:

         1. A message is entered on node A.

         2. Node A exports the message to node B and node C placing
            the seen-by for A, B, and C in the message as it does so.

         3. Node B sees that node D is not listed in the seen-by and
            exports the message to node D.

         4. Node C sees that node D is not listed in the seen-by and
            exports the message to node D.

       At this point node D has received the same message twice - a
       duplicate was generated.

       Normally a "dup-ring" will not be as simple as a square.
       Generally it will be caused by a system on one end of a long
       chain accidentally connecting to a system on the other end of
       the chain.  This causes the two ends of the chain to become
       connected, forming a polygon.

       In FidoNet this problem is reduced somewhat by having a
       regional EchoMail star distribution architecture that
       maintains EchoMail connections within regions of the world.
       Within that architecture only a small number of prearranged
       systems (regional collection systems) make inter-regional
       connections.  This architecture, along with multiple daily
       connections, results in an efficient topology which typically
       allows global distribution within 24 hours.

                         THE PATH LINE AND TOPOLOGY

       The PATH line stores the net/node numbers of each system
       having actually processed a message.  This information is
       useful in correcting the biggest problem encountered by nodes
       running an Echomail compatible system - the problem of finding
       the cause of duplicate messages.  How does the PATH line help
       solve this problem?  Take the following path line as an
       example:

                 ^APATH: 107/6 107/312 132/101

       This shows that the message was processed by system 107/6 and
       transferred to system 107/312.  It further shows system
       107/312 transferred the message to 132/101, and 132/101
       processed it again.  Here's another example:

     FIDONEWS 14-21               Page 22                  26 May 1997


                 ^APATH: 107/6 107/312 107/528 107/312 132/101

       This shows the message having been processed by node 107/312
       on more than one occasion.  Based upon the earlier description
       of the 'information control' fields in Echomail messages, this
       identifies an error in processing.  This further shows node
       107/528 as the node which apparently processed the message
       incorrectly.  In this case the path line can be used to help
       locate the source of duplicate messages or topology problems.

       In a conference with many participants it becomes almost
       impossible to determine the exact topology used.  In these
       cases the use of the path line can help a moderator or
       distributor of a conference track any possible breakdowns in
       the overall topology, while not substantially increasing the
       amount of information transmitted.  Having this small amount
       of information added to each message pays for itself very
       quickly when it can be used to help detect a topology problem
       causing duplicate messages to be transmitted to each system.

     WHAT IF DR. SEUSS WROTE TECHNICAL MANUALS?

     If a packet hits a pocket on a socket on a port,
     and the bus is interrupted as a very last resort,
     and the address of the memory makes your floppy disk abort,
     then the socket packet pocket has an error to report!

     If your cursor finds a menu item followed by a dash,
     and the double clicking icons put your window in the trash,
     and your data is corrupted 'cause the index doesn't hash,
     then your situation's hopeless, and your system's gonna crash!!!

     If the label on your cable on the gable at your house
     says the network is connected to the button on your mouse,
     but your packet wants to tunnel to another protocol,
     that's repeatedly rejected by the printer down the hall,
     and your screen is all distorted by the side effects of gauss,
     so your icons in the window are as wavy as a souse,
     then may as well reboot and go out with a bang,
     'cause as sure as I'm a poet, the sucker's gonna hang!!

     When the copy of your floppy's getting sloppy on the disk,
     and the microcode instructions cause unnecessary RISC,
     then you have to FLASH your memory and you'll want to RAM your ROM.
     Quickly turn off your computer and be sure to tell your Mom!!
