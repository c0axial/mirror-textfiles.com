Editorial:  More and not the same

by Tom Jennings (1:1/1)

Well, other than fiddling around with how the newsletter works, I
haven't been a very good editor -- I have not been actively looking for
articles and such for inclusion here. It was something I had planned to
do, and still do. I guess I underestimated my overall workload, once
again. I haven't forgotten it though. (But of course there's nothing
stopping *you* from contacting various people or groups and soliciting
articles, or getting the credit -- in here -- for doing so.)


One other thing -- I received an article, anonymously, that was no more
than a personal hit piece on a few people the author didn't like. Sorry,
it won't appear in FidoNews unsigned. ARTSPEC.DOC says anon is OK, but
for things that look like personal letters, I want to know that it isn't
fake. See below for something on this very subject.


                        * * * * *

More on the FidoNews article submission policy. Assuming you read my
editorial last week (FIDO838) about the policy change, you may have
noticed I gave all sorts of rationale about my proposal to solve a
central problem in FidoNews -- but forgot to state it. (Well, at least,
I didn't make it crystal clear.) It is this --

That the biggest source of problems in FidoNews isn't so much specific,
single articles of dubious content, but the endless "rebuttal",
complaint, followup, reiteration, and-how-about's, ad infinitum, that
follows some of those dubious articles.

I won't go into great detail again, but suffice to say that I'm pretty
much going to implement what I stated last week, unless I get some
reasoned (emphasis on "reason") arguments otherwise. With two additions.
Here's the proposal, in loose language:


I now propose that the policy remain "wide open". However --

        If a particular article generates a cascade of
        responses, the editor does two things: (1) chooses
        one or few of them as representative; (2) passes them
        on to the original author, who is asked to write a
        response within (say) 2 weeks. The resulting representative
        response(s), and the original authors response, are
FidoNews 8-39                  Page 2                      30 Sep 1991


        run in one (3rd week?) FidoNews issue. This is done
        ONCE ONLY. Interested parties can then pick up the
        torch and march with it off the long or short pier
        of their choice.

One small addition:

        Articles must be no more 10,000 characters long, or
        longer at the editors discretion.


And one more substantial addition: that the anonymous-authorship stuff
be changed. Anonymity is simply a tiny variation on privacy, which I
support 101% in all forms. It allows people to say things that they
believe need saying, but for which they believe they will be punished
for. Believe me, it happens.

There is a more-or-less traditional way to handle anonymously-authored
works, which I propose to implement, which is:

        All submissions must include the author(s) name and
        full contact information, so that the editor can
        verify authorship if necessary. The author may request
        that the article be run anonymously.

        The editor and all persons working on FidoNews in
        any capacity are charged to keep authors name
        and contact information completely confidential.

Observations of FidoNews
Hal Duprie on 1:101/106

Well Tom, you did ask for this (boring as it may be). Overall, I am
against "censorship" of any kind for FidoNews -- but also have a
practical problem.

The problem is that I am a host, and in the old fashioned tradition of
FidoNet I feel a responsibility to deliver the News and Nodediff to all
my nodes which desire same. Now, approximately 30 of my nodes do desire
delivery. Yes, I know that newer versions of policy allow me to have my
nodes poll for it (as I do poll region -- a LD call). But I have not
been able to resolve that "cop- out" with my personal beliefs in
Anarchy, and so I still deliver.

This results in very heavy net traffic, for the friday through tue
period (as the stuff gets delivered). Pretty large phone bills too.

So, how do I feel about censorship of the News? Even with the burden of
distributing a LARGE FidoNews with very little actual FIDO news in it, i
still deliver the whole thing. Every week. Without fail.

As you have pointed out several times, the problem with censorship is
"who decides". I'd rather be offended, pay the price for delivering
"NEWS" I personally disagree with, and in general put up with the noise
and preaching. Because the alternative is unacceptable to me.
Censorship and a truly free society (or net) just can't co-exist.

As a person I sometimes disagree strongly with the articles,
occasionally with the language, and definitely with the bible thumpers.
Yet I still distribute, and will continue to do so as long as I am a
host.

Such is the price of freedom.

You have suggested some changes that seem reasonable. Removing the
wasted white space for printer formatting, etc. Those ideas I strongly
support as a cost savings measure.
You have asked about dropping articles on subjects that are obviously
unrelated to FidoNet -- everything from attempts at writing stories to
the Bible forum.

I find the stories incompetent at best, and the Bible forum a waste of
bandwidth. The other obvious areas that could be cut are just that --
obvious. But should we censor them out?

I think not. Because the problem always remains. Who decides? When it
comes to information in a free society, NO ONE is more equal than anyone
else. NO ONE can make the decision for me. Even you, Tom, whom I respect
deeply (even tell my children real stories from the legendary past about
TJ and FidoNet).

FidoNews 8-39                  Page 5                      30 Sep 1991


And so, I suggest that any technical method you can use to reduce the
size be adopted, but NO censorship.

If someone doesn't like it, they shouldn't read it. That is real
freedom.

Other minor things.

Reason I hadn't replied to your request for comments in FidoNews is
because I suspect you won't censor. Just not your style. Reason I did
reply now is your statement in 838 that you had not received any
comments. Scary.

I have ALL the issues of Fidonews -- 8 years worth -- and it really
doesn't seem that long. If the FidoNews archives are short an issue,
drop me a message and I'll send you it.

Peace, and thanks for EFF -- great reading and popular on my system.

Hal DuPrie, Host, Net 101.

John Burden
European Democracy, a reply

The recent article by Michael Pereira demands a reply, if only to
correct the distortions and inaccuracies it contains.  Unfortunately,
because of the subject matter, personalities are bound to come into
it.  However, without reducing this to the level of a street brawl,
let me try to explain why I disagree so strongly with his claims.

His article makes the statement that the various Fidonet regions of
Europe are somehow different and then leaves this statement hanging
there - perhaps hoping that it will somehow become absorbed into the
grey matter of those in Zone 1 who make some of the policy decisions
affecting the whole of Fidonet.  Why?  To further the wish of a
miniscule group to wish to drag the UK into zone 1!

The argument has been used by one or more of this small group that the
UK is, in some way, more like the USA than Europe.  What way?
Geographically?  Culturally?  Racially?  If we are in fact culturally
aligned with another continent, then we probably have more in common
with Australasia than we do with the USA, so on this basis should we
seek to become a part of Zone 3?

He then refers to a state of anarchy within Region 25, the UK -
without going into details.  Let me fill in the gaps for those of you
who don't know the facts.
FidoNews 8-39                  Page 6                      30 Sep 1991


Michael Pereira received public (and private) requests from an
echomail moderator to keep within the rules of that echo, the UK
sysops' conference.  He ignored them, and became increasingly vocal
and abusive within the echo.  Eventually the moderator cut him off
from the conference, at which point one of his supporters starting
feeding it to him in direct contravention of the moderator's ruling
and Fidonet policy.

After increasingly heated messages with various people, he threatened
a fellow sysop with violence and was subsequently excommunicated from
Fidonet.  Instead of going through the appeal procedure which is
contained in Fidonet policy for the benefit of us all, he joined in
discussion with a net host on ways to obtain a new node number.  By an
amazing accident, the host concerned produced a nodelist update
containing the excommunicated sysop's listing, thereby effectively
over-riding the excommunication.  Although this has been brought to
his attention, it has not been removed.

And then the man who is the centre of unprecedented discord within the
UK produces an article which sets out to portray him as the great
white saviour of democracy and Fidonet!  The reality, as several of us
in the UK have learned, is the opposite.  He has threatened violence
against an opponent, he has defied echomail moderators, he has, quite
deliberately, broken Fidonet policy and caused others to do so.  His
expulsion from Fidonet has not been withdrawn and no appeal has been
completed.  The fact of the matter is that he is STILL excommunicated.

In his article, he refers to a dramatic increase in the amount of
dissent, dissatisfaction, anger and mutiny.  What he fails to say, of
course, is that HE is the mutinous dissenter, the angry man
threatening physical violence.  We sysops who want nothing more than
to carry on with our hobby in peace are subjected to his rantings in
echo after echo.  He is quick to quote policy when it suits him and
ignore it at other times.  He has yet to accept that policy is there
to provide a framework within which we can operate and communicate
with each other.  Like national laws, it is there to protect us - from
the likes of Mr. Pereira, for a start.

He talks about democracy, that fragile flower which is blooming in
Eastern Europe, as though this contrasts with the state of Fidonet in
the UK  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The UK (Region 25)
has already implemented democratic elections for Regional Controllers.
In fact, our existing RC was elected on that basis, and recently
received a vote of confidence from UK sysops at the time when Mr.
Pereira started his campaign of defiance against him.

The alleged concerns for democracy and "grunt" sysops sit ill on the
shoulders of one who has so clearly demonstrated, by his actions, his
contempt for democracy and the expressed wishes of sysops within the
UK.  I suggest that, if he had any integrity at all, he would accept
his excommunication and go through a properly conducted appeal
procedure.

      Development Manager: Will Schlichtman (1:350/59.0@fidonet)

Last week we began the release of Version 3.2 of the Fort Worth Nodelist
format.  The first section covered an overview of the format, including
general line entry definitions.  This week we go into detail defining
what each field means and valid information used in those fields.  We
also cover the tricky dialing translation information.  And, at the
end, we provide a sample net nodelist entry.

  2.4 Field Definitions
  ---------------------

  z_num --
      Defines the Zone number of a large geographic Zone.  Valid values
      are any integer between 1 and 32767 inclusive.  Each Zone number
      MUST be unique to a nodelist and may NOT be repeated.

  r_num --
      Defines the Region number of a geographic Region.  Valid values are
      any integer between 1 and 32767 inclusive.  Each Region number MUST
      be unique to a Zone and may NOT be repeated.  No Region number may
      be the same as the Zone number.

  n_num --
      Defines the Net number of a local area Network.  Valid values are
      any integer between 1 and 32767 inclusive.  Each Net number MUST be
      unique to a Zone and may NOT be repeated.  No Net number may be
      the same as the Zone number or Region number.

  h_num --
      Defines the Hub number of a mail-routing hub of a local area Net.
      Valid values are any integer between 1 and 32767.  Each Hub number
      MUST be unique to a Net and may NOT be repeated, either as an Hub
      number or as an individual node number (defined below).

  num --
FidoNews 8-39                  Page 8                      30 Sep 1991


      Defines the individual node number of a single system in a local
      area Net, as well as individual node numbers of Zone Service Nodes
      and Regional Independant Nodes.  Valid values are any integer
      between 1 and 32767.  Each node number MUST be unique to a Net
      (Zone, or Region, as appropriate) and may NOT be repeated, either as
      a Hub number or as an individual node number.

  area --
      Geographic area of administration which a Zone, Region, or Net
      covers.  Maximum field length is twenty (20) characters.  Valid
      values are any alphanumeric characters except the space ( ), which
      is represented by the underscore (_) character.

  sysop --
      Defines the name of the person responsible for the conduct of an
      individual node.  Valid values are any alphanumeric characters
      except the space ( ), which is represented by the underscore (_)
      character.

  ac --
      Defines the area code or other information that repeats from node to
      node, ommitted in normal node listings.  This is used in dialing
      translations.  See the section "Dialing Translations".

  fphone --
      Defines the entire phone number of a node, including area code or
      other information which repeats from node to node in a given area.

  phone --
      Defines the phone number of a node, not including area code or other
      information which repeats from node to node in a given area.

  bps --
      Defines the DTE/DCE speed of the modem used by a node.  Valid
      values are:

           Flag     Means

            3       300 bps
            1       1200 bps
            2       2400 bps
            9       9600 bps
            4       14,400 bps
            0       19,200 bps
            8       38,400 bps

      Other flags may be added as technology becomes available.  It
      should be noted that at the time this document was written, no
      modem was able to communicate at a DTE/DCE rate faster than 9,600
      bps, and so all such modems should be listed with the "9" flag.

FidoNews 8-39                  Page 9                      30 Sep 1991


  mdmflg --
      Defines any special protocols in use by a node's modem, such as
      error correction or data compression.  Flags are one or two bytes in
      length.  Valid values are:

           Flag     Means

           V2        CCITT V.21   300 bps full duplex
           22        CCITT V.22   1200 bps full duplex
           V9        CCITT V.29   9600 bps half duplex
           V3        CCITT V.32   9600 bps full duplex
           3B        CCITT V.32bis
           33        CCITT V.33
           34        CCITT V.34
           V4        CCITT V.42
           4B        CCITT V.42bis
           M         Microcom Network Protocol (MNP)
           H9        Hayes V9600
           H         USRobotics Courier HST
           MA        Microcom AX/96xx series
           P         Packet Ensemble Protocol (PEP)
           C         CompuCom Speed Modem

                 NOTE:  Many V22 modems also support Bell 212A.

            If no modem flag is given,  Bell 212A is assumed for 1200 bps
            systems,  CCITT V22bis is assumed for 2400 bps systems.

      A separate error correction flag should not be used when error
      correction type can be determined by the modem flag.  For instance,
      modem flags of H and C imply M,  3B implies V3, and 4B implies V4.

      Because modems can support multiple optional protocols more than one
      flag may be required.  For example, the USRobotics Courier Dual
      Standard with V.32bis and V.42bis requires three flags.  In such
      cases flags can be put together in one field, like so:
                            "...,9,H3B4B,..."

      Flags can be added as technology becomes available.

      If no flag is appropriate the field should be ommitted.

  ho --
      Defines the hours of operation of a given node.  Valid values can be
      in one of two formats or empty, determined as follows:
                                "...,,..."
                               "...,CM,..."
                            "...,HHMMhhmm,..."

      If a node accepts mail only during the Zone Mail Hour (ZMH) as
      defined in FTS-0001, this field should be left blank as in the first
FidoNews 8-39                  Page 10                     30 Sep 1991


      example above.

      Some software allows the capability to receive mail 24 hours a day.
      If such software is active on a given node, the CM (continuous mail)
      flag should be listed, as in the second example above.

      Sometimes a node accepts mail only during certain hours of the day
      outside of ZMH.  If this is the case, this field appears as follows:

      HH defines the hour, in 24-hour format calculated to Universal
         Coordinated Time (UTC), that a node begins accepting mail.
         Valid values are any integer between 00 and 23.
      MM defines the minute, in 24-hour format calculated to Universal
         Coordinated Time (UTC), that a node begins accepting mail.  Valid
         values are any integer between 00 and 59.
      hh defines the hour, in 24-hour format calculated to Universal
         Coordinated Time (UTC), that a node stops accepting mail.  Valid
         values are any integer between 00 and 23.
      mm defines the minute, in 24-hour format calculated to Universal
         Coordinated Time (UTC), that a node stops accepting mail.  Valid
         values are any integer between 00 and 59.

      Times may span midnight.  An example of a valid value of the third
      type is "...,23000600,...".  This means that the node in question
      accepts mail from 11:00 p.m. until 6:00 a.m.

  frq --
      Defines the type of file and/or update requests supported by a node,

      Defines any optional flags that convey additional information about
      a node that might be required by a mailer.  Policy dictates who
      decides what flags go in the nodelist, but the following flags are
      standard:

            Flag      Means

            MN        No compression supported
            Gx..x     Gateway to domain
            #xx       Node observes given mail hour
            Ux..x     User specified string

      Each flag MUST be separated by a comma (,).

      NOTES:
         MN - The only compression method standard in FidoNet is
            archiving, using the standard SEA ARC format, with archive
            names defined by the specification for ARCMail v0.6.  The
            absence of the MN flag indicates that ARCMail v0.6 compression
            is supported by this node.

         Gx..x - Gateway to domain 'x..x', where 'x..x' is a string of
            alphanumeric characters.  Valid values for 'x..x' are assigned
            by the FidoNet Internaional Coordinator, his designee, or as
            defined by policy.  Current valid values of 'x..x' may be
            found in the notes at the end of the FidoNet nodelist.

         #xx - When applicable,  the mail period flags may be strung
            together with no intervening commas,  eg. "#02#09".  Only
            mail hours other than that standard within a node's zone
            should be given.  Since observance of mail hour within
            one's zone is mandatory,  it should not be indicated.  To
            determine the digit to use the Zone number of the ZMH being
            observed is used.  For example, a node in Zone 4 observing
            mail hours of Zones 1, 2, 3, and 5 should be listed
            "...,#01#02#03#05,..."

         Ux..x - A user-specified string, which may contain any
            alphanumeric character except spaces ( ).  This string may
            contain one to twenty characters information that may be used
            to add user-defined data to a specific nodelist entry.  The
            FidoNet International Coordinator may define valid values for
            this field.

       FTSC recognizes that the FidoNet International Coordinator is the
       ultimate authority over what appears in the FidoNet nodelist. Also,
       FTSC is by definition a deliberative body,  and adding or changing
       a flag may take a considerable amount of time.  Therefore,  the
       FidoNet International Coordinator may temporarily make changes or
       additions to the flags as defined in this document.  The FidoNet
       International Coordinator will then consult with FTSC over the
FidoNews 8-39                  Page 12                     30 Sep 1991


       changes needed to this document to reflect these temporary changes.


  2.5 Dialing Translations:
  -------------------------

       Because normal nodes do not carry area codes or other repeating
       information (lumped into the heading "area codes") in their
       individual phone listings, a method must be implemented to handle
       this.  This is the function of the ac field in the Net listing.  It
       is used as follows, with the following nodelist lines used as
       an example.  They have been white-spaced to make them easier to
       read.  Normally no white space would appear in a listing!

   num  area     sysop            ac     phone or  +---bps
                                         fphone    v  mdmflg ho  req

    The "ac" field is added to the BEGINNING of each "phone" field,
    including that belonging to the NC, in a given nodelist until a
    static flag indicates otherwise.

    The "ac" field is NOT added to nodes carrying the "Z", "R", "S",
    "I", "O", "U", "P", or "D" flags.

    The "ac" field from the NC line is added to each line until a "U" or
    "N" flag is spotted, at which time the new "ac" field is read. The
    "U" ac field is then added to all nodes below it, until a new "U"
    flag or a new "N" flag is read.  If a "Z" or "R" flag is spotted the
    ac field is ignored until the occurance of another "N" flag.

    If an "O" flag is present, the current "ac" field is not added, but
    instead the entire phone number listed, with no translation, is
    used.  Adding the "ac" flag resumes on the next line, if no other
    flag is present.

    If a "U,NUL" set is present, there are only three fields, two of
    which are static.  The third field is the area code, and the line
    terminates with a CR/LF pair, as any other line in the nodelist.

    Using the above lines, we can see that the phone numbers for each of
    the above nodes are:

SIGnet was created as a network for BBS sysops to join as a
cost-free, politics free environment for the exchange of
ideas, values, conversation, and information.

SIGnet was designed in a way that no single person has any
power to obstruct information, or eliminate any operation
of the network in any way without a common vote from the
network.  Everyone, no matter their designation in the
network, has a single vote in every ballot put before the
SIGnet membership. The SIGnet membership consists of the
sysop of each and every system in SIGnet. No sysop may
have more than 1 vote, no matter how many node numbers
they have.
