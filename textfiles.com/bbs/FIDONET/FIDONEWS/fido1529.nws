     There are times when there are no words to define or distinguish an
     event or occurrence.

     Rather than a 'middle path', we watch as Fido in Zone 1 swings to one
     extreme, rather than one of moderation.

     History does indeed repeat itself.

     Dave Beach's Survey - An Observation on the Methodology
     by Jerry Schwartz, 1:142/928

     Dave Beach's recent survey of RC10 sysops underscores the
     difficulty of using polls to judge public opinion on
     controversial matters.

     First of all, a survey such as this depends upon self-selection:
     only those who want to respond, for whatever reason, are counted.
     The fat, dumb, and happy rarely exert themselves to express their
     apathy.  Professional pollsters take special measures to correct
     for this problem, such as contacting a sample of the
     non-respondents face to face to judge their sentiments.

     Second, two questions which are actually getting at the same
     point may be answered very differently, depending upon the
     phrasing.  My favorite example is the way people react to "Would
     you want to see your tax dollars used to help the unemployed?"
     vs. "Do you think the government should take money from you and
     give it to people who don't work?"

     In Dave's survey, 83.9% of the respondents said that they agreed
     with the way their NC cast his vote; 87.1% felt that they'd been
     adequately consulted by their NC prior to the vote; but 74.2% are
     unhappy with the results.  There are many possible explanations
     for this contradiction, but unfortunately we have no way of
     knowing what's really going on.  Did people for some perverse
     reason want their NC to vote for someone they didn't want to win?
     Was the winner considered the lesser of two evils?  Did different
     people respond to each question?

     Third, when interpreting the results of the survey it is easy to
     undercut the statistical results by quoting opposing comments.
     Of the 83.9% who agreed with the way their NC voted, did none of
     them comment?  (The only two comments quoted were negative.)

     And fourth, the results of a survey can be skewed by people's
     perception of the pollster.  Try dressing as a Catholic priest
     and asking people if they believe that all religions deserve
     respect; then try dressing like Ozzie Ozborne and asking the same
     question.

     Dave Beach's Survey - An Observation on the Results
     by Jerry Schwartz, 1:142/928

     My other article comments upon the difficulty of finding out what
     people really think by the strikingly simple but profoundly
     difficult technique of asking them.  This article deals with the
     FIDONEWS 15-29               Page 3                   20 Jul 1998


     reported results.

     In his introductory editorial paragraphs, Dave refers to Bob
     Satti as being "maintained in office with the support of
     unelected, appointed Regional Coordinators"; but within the body
     of the survey he asks "Are you aware that it's common practice in
     other Regions to have direct sysop voting for the RC position?" I
     haven't seen the survey itself, so I presume that the editorial
     comments were added when the results were prepared; but even so,
     this suggests a contradiction: is it common practice for RCs to
     be elected directly by sysops, or are the RCs largely unelected
     as Dave implies?

     Also, there have been repeated charges that Bob Kohl has so
     strangled the flow of information within Region 10 that the
     sysops are being kept unaware of what is going on; yet 80.6%
     reported being aware of both a recent PC filed against Bob Kohl
     and the actions of the RECC.  That is odd.

     83.9% of the responding sysops agree with the way their Network
     Coordinator voted.  Whatever else that means, it says pretty
     clearly that the NCs did not contravene the wishes of those they
     represented.  Regardless of whether you believe in direct or
     representative democracy, this survey doesn't suggest that the
     results would have been different if the sysops had voted
     directly.

     Nonetheless, only 12.9% of the responding sysops are satisfied
     with the results of the election.  As I said in my other article,
     there's no way of knowing why this discrepancy arose.  Of all of
     the results compiled, this is the most troubling statistic.  Does
     it mean that people don't think Bob Kohl has done a good job, but
     they want to give him a second chance?  Does it mean that they
     don't like Bob Kohl, but they like his opponent even less?  Does
     it mean that they aren't satified with Bob Kohl, but were afraid
     to take a chance on any change?  Does it mean that there is some
     odd statistical corner case which reconciles all of these
     numbers?

     Finally, 80.6% of the respondents answered that they didn't need
     their identities to be kept confidential; yet the one comment
     which was selected for quotation implied (as has been said over
     and over again by Bob Kohl's opponents) that anyone who speaks
     out in Region 10 is marked for excommunication.

     We should be very careful about letting our preconceptions guide
     us when reading these tea leaves.  No one of the questions gives
     anything like a complete picture of the situation; and taken
     together, they are a mass of contradictions.  As such, they may
     well represent the opinions they were intended to illuminate.

     Last week I developed my web page @ members.xoom.com/Rebeljambo/
     to Run Realtime Java chat so everyone with access to the internet can
     chat about Fidonet online. I thought this would be a good idea so we
     can all have a say. I am also setting up a PowWoW confrence so anyone
     with powWoW can chat as well. Please logon and give it a try. As for
     the PowWoW I will arange a time so everyone that wants to can logon.

     A PARTY!!
     Paul Lentz 1:124/5025

     Region19's Poor Man's FidoCon and River Party  XI
     July 25-26, 1998 on the Guadalupe River in Texas

     Every year Region19 throws a party so every fidonet member can get a
     chance to see an RC with a beer in each hand, to show and tell the
     most massive hardrive ever made just before seeing who can toss it
     the farthest, to listen to tall tales from Wheeties, and to have a
     general good time. We'd like to invite everyone in Fidonet to come
     and join us 19ers in the fun!


     The Place?
     Whitewater Sports. This is a campground/tube rental place located on
     the Guadalupe River where it dumps out of Canyon Lake, just
     North of New Brunsfels, Texas, and roughly halfway between Austin and
     San Antonio on I-35. The place is pretty big with lots of spaces for
     tents and RVs, with about 75 acres to fill up. Reservations aren't
     required, and they have always said that a large group should not be
     a problem.

     There are "rustic" bathroom facilties (if memory serves me correctly)
     including hot showers and there is a small store there for a few
     scant essentials you might need. If you really need supplies, you
     would probably be better off bringing them with you.

     The Attraction?
     Nice cold water! The water comes straight out of the bottom of a very
     deep lake, and flows at this location around a great mile or so
     horseshoe. This means you can drag your tube from the campsite up the
     main road about a quater mile, get in and liesurely float around to
     the campground again, and plus there are a couple of places where the
     water runs a little bit faster so's you can get dumped out of the
     tube and into the water.

     Added Attraction?
     New Brunfels Texas is close-by and we might wanna run into town for
     some of their great German food on Saturday night.

     Directions?
     First... Get your butt to Texas! :-) From I-35 exit at EXIT 191
     CANYON LAKE 306. Go NW on 306 about 12 miles till you see Whitewater
     Sports on the right just before a bridge. Look around for us! One of
     us will have a crude hand painted sign that will let you know who we
     are.

     For a few pictures of last years party see Ron Bemis's Web page at
     http://www.iain.com/~rbemis/

     also for a couple of pictures and link to a map of the area see
     http://www.startext.net/np/net124/pmfc&rp.htm


     Info and Rules:

     $15 per vehicle per night (tent)
     $18 per vehicle per night with electricity (wimps)
     $6 per day plus a $5 deposit to rent a tube
     $8 per day plus a $10 deposit to rent a tube with a bottom thingy
     The Phone number at Whitewater Sports is 830-964-3800

     NO PETS are allowed at Whitewater Sports so leave your real Fido at
     home.
     NO LOUD NOISE is allowed at Whitewater Sports after 10pm.
     NO GLASS or STYROFOAM is allowed in the river.

     There is work going on at the dam and recent rains or lack thereof is
     effecting water levels as regulated by the Army Corps of Engineers.
     It is customary for them to bring the flow up to around 300 cfs on
     weekends to keep the fun going though. Whitewater suggests that if
     the water level is really important to you, that you call them before
     hand as they can update you.

     COMPUTERS AND RADIOS are discouraged (they'll probably end up in the
     river).
     Beer and Bratwurst is highly encouraged.
     Bringing Single unattached female friends with low tolerence for
     alcohol is highly encouraged.
     Clothes may or may not be required (check your mirror).
     Those funky "Lake Shoes" and sunblock are recommended.
     San Marcos and San Antonio are not too far away so any Hotel/Airport
     WEENIES should be able to find accomadations/transport
     allowing them to attend.

     Hope to see everybody there!

     Dear Editorbeing,

     This article was submitted by Doc Logger(163/110) who
     managed to spend a whole week at home. The front lawn of his
     house was choked with Ilana vines and a small community of
     badgers had taken up residence on the front porch.

     Roll da flic, Zorch....



     Dear Reverend Visage,

     There were a couple of approaches I could take to the events
     of the last week. My first inclination was to gloat and
     assert that a victory had been achieved but in practical
     terms what has unfolded has more tragic dimensions.

     In a nutshell, the events of the past week are as follows. A
     whole net in Region10 pulled up stakes and moved to
     Region12. They did so because they could no longer
     countenance the behaviour of Bob Kohl. When the new entries
     in the nodelist were published, Satti responded almost
     immediately and demanded of the Region12 RC that the nodes
     be removed from the Region12 segment. Satti went further and
     said that if the R12C didn't remove the refugees, that Satti
     would edit the nodelist segment himself. In response,
     Region12 prepared to issue an entirely new nodelist which
     would have corrected any editing attempts by Satti. When
     several of the backbone echomail distributors and the Z2C
     agreed to distribute the new nodelist, Satti was
     emasculated. For the first time since the Peefour brigands
     hijacked Fidonet, the sysops were able to make Satti
     irrelevant and refuse to be bullied by his idiocy.

     Whether Satti responded to the speeding train, or whether he
     independently changed his mind makes little difference. The
     Region10 refugees graciously accepted Satti's offer of a
     geographic exemption which obviated the need for a nodelist
     showdown. Satti's lack of management skills as the issue
     unfolded are only a minor part of the tragedy.

     The real issue is what became of Bob Kohl, who started out
     as a sysop, and who eventually held some of the highest
     titles in Zone 1 (being both an RC and the ZEC.) It appears
     that Kohl will lose both titles in the coming week. The
     question that puzzled me was: How could Bob have gone from
     being a helpful sysop (as accounts of his earlier Fidonet
     existence attest) to one of the most odious miscreants on
     the landscape? I think the answer to the question lies in
     the same realm that explains the behaviour of Richard Nixon.
     FIDONEWS 15-29               Page 7                   20 Jul 1998


     Both Kohl & Nixon lacked the sense of self-worth requisite
     to ignoring the urge for retribution against their enemies.
     They mistook attainment of power for the need to act
     responsibly. Like Nixon, Kohl had sycophantic toadies
     leading him to acts of venality. And like Nixon, Kohl
     believed that those who exposed his egregious behaviour were
     enemies of Fidonet.

     Another part of the tragedy is that we have seen David
     Bowerman labouring in the Z1C echo, like Ron Ziegler,
     trying to justify the notion that *Cs have the right screw
     sysops because Peefour grants those powers. What is missing
     from Bowerman's messages is a sense that ethics and justice
     are overriding concerns that ought to take a primary place
     to a slavish adherence to policy. Bowerman was calling on
     the R12C to resign because messages from Satti threatening
     nodes in region12 had been crossposted into the regional
     echo. Bowerman didn't see the irony in the fact that only
     despots fear having their actions publicized. It is more
     than a little pathetic to see relics of Satti's regime cling
     by their fingernails in the fading days of their abuse of
     Fidonet.

     I'm going to digress a bit and gum a few mashed bananas
     about the ancient days when I was NC of our net. I was
     elected in a fractious period where the newly foisted
     Peefour was used by every mouthbreathing cretin with an ax
     to grind. I campaigned on the statement that anyone who
     filed a policy complaint was de facto, "too easily annoyed"
     and that Peefour was not the law of Fidoland. The relevant
     part of this reminiscing has to do with the use and abuse of
     power. There was a sysop in our net who whined incessantly
     about everything and filed policy complaints on an almost
     weekly basis. This individual would dutifully quote every
     obscenity he found and then demand that something be done to
     clean up Fidonet. I truly loathed the man, particularly
     since he was one of the first in our net to quote every
     message like a crack-crazed banshee. One day it occurred to
     me that as NC, and if I accepted the cretin's notions of
     Peefour, that I could bounce him from the net. I was sorely
     tempted. The temptation and the fact that I spent a few
     nanoseconds contemplating action led me to conclude that the
     powers granted to *Cs under Peefour was a poisonous and
     almost irresistible slide towards the wrong sort of
     management.

     Our net had a subsequent NC who wasted no time at all on
     using his presumed powers to attempt revenge on his enemies.
     That NC was eventually recalled by a sysop level vote when
     the excesses became too great to stomach.

     The point of this reminiscing is that in nets or regions
     with no democratic traditions, the tendency for power to
     corrupt absolutely is quite severe. Both Kohl and Satti
     succumbed to the inevitable because they both slavishly
     adhere to Peefour which is a document which guarantees their
     FIDONEWS 15-29               Page 8                   20 Jul 1998


     isolation from accountability.

     In an ideal world, Satti would recognize that he has lost
     the confidence of a large part of Zone 1 and call a sysop
     level election for a replacement. I have little faith that
     Satti will recognize political reality and expect that he
     will continue to blunder his way through another set of
     profound management errors. It has been months since Satti
     posted messages in the Z1C echo and it appears that he will
     keep hiding in his bunker, sheltered from reality.

     I must go Visage, Bob Moravsik has invited me to play in the
     "Budfoon's Tuba Marching Band" and you know how insanely
     jealous he gets when someone disrupts his bottom-feeding
     frenzies. I shall make your apologies for being unable to
     attend Walloonetta's graduation ceremonies and explain that
     the amount of Kava you ingested left you immobile for the
     whole week.

     Subject: Fido1528 Bob Kohl Article: "Story of Statistics"

     Letter to the Editor:

     I began reading Bob Kohl's article.  When I read:

     "I'm sure that Dave couldn't possible accept the fact that there are
     many NCs in Reg 10 that seem to little if any problems in the way
     Reg 10 has worked these past years."

     my concentration began to wane.  I've only now divined "that seem to
     little if any problems" translates to "that see few if any problems".
     That took several minutes and I'm still not sure my translation is
     correct.

     I pressed on. In his next paragraph I read:

     "It's interesting to note that Dave little submission to the Snooze
     and in the echos runs almost on a par with those of Spiro Agnew many
     years ago."

     At this point my mind boggled and came to a halt.  I've been reading
     Spiro Agnew for years and echoes and this newsletter for years.
     Never have I read anything by Agnew in an echo or this newsletter.

     Thank you for publishing this article by Bob Kohl. I never did get to
     the statistics.  I won't be reading any more Bob Kohl.

     Subject: your editorial of 13 July
     Date: Mon, 13 Jul 1998 14:29:25 -0700
     From: "David Hallford" <hallford@thevision.net>
     To: <editor@fidonews.org>

     Hi Zorch,

        I don't have any old messages hanging around to check with since
     I don't archive, but I beleive I said that I wouldn't return to
     Region10 while Bob Kohl was RC10. I may be wrong, but that's what I
     remember.

       If you wish to accuse me of something I think you would be better
     off talking about the 2 times i returened to Region 10 while Bob Kohl
     was RC10.

       The 1st time I used your real name to mess with your serenity since
     you persist in attacking people while hiding behind an alias.

       The 2nd time was to support the opposition candidate in an
     election. Within 6 hours of the nodelist coming out, Bob Kohl had
     notified everyone that I was not to have a feed to R10SYSOP. I guess
     he didn't want any opposition to him, or any support for the other
     candidate voiced where the region could see it.

                                                                take care,
                                                                    Dave
