     Would the ancient Israelis have fared better if Moses would have
     come down from the mountain with the Ten Suggestions?

     Though addressing matters less spiritual, an ongoing debate in the
     FN_SYSOP echo touches the subject of toning down Policy 4.  The
     range of the debate has been widespread.  Some have advocated
     modifications to the policy, while others have advocated just
     ignoring it.  While the validity of P4 has been seriously
     challenged, there's little doubt that this document has been widely
     regarded as Fidonet's "law and order."

     Recently, Darrell Salter has been spearheading an attempt to
     formulate "Guidelines" to influence the interactions between sysops.
     He urges participants to consider the way sysops work together as a
     cooperative thing rather than an authoritative thing.  This is a
     serious attempt at formulating the concept of anarchy touted by
     Fidonet's founder, Tom Jennings.  The term "Guidelines" as he's
     using it should not be considered a politically-correct term for
     "Policy."

     While most sysops seem to agree that Fidonet is basically a
     cooperative structure, Darrell's ideas are not totally embraced by
     all.  Carol Shenkenberger pointed out in the early stages of the
     debate that Policy 4, though regarded by some as completely
     authoritative, is mostly used as a set of guidelines.  Carol's
     initial effort was to suggest modifications to P4 and rely on the
     common sense of coordinators to keep from applying it as an
     instrument of abuse.  Andrea Santos has argued that some conditions
     in Fidonet will continue to call for authoritative administrative
     action; conditions such as packet ramming.

     So what's it to be?  Authority or Cooperation?  If the truth can be
     found in the past, neither approach has been totally successful.
     Kay Shapiro pointed out once in a letter reprinted in Fidonews that
     Fido _has_ to be a cooperative structure because it simply doesn't
     have the police force to maintain total authority.  Certainly, if
     Fido were a police state, Region 10 wouldn't have lost its "Refugee
     Nodes" in the past.  On the other hand, many a moderator has seen
     the cooperative approach fail with a problem poster in his echo,
     having to resort to a feed cut to establish order (basically an
     authoritative solution).

     Perhaps the only answer is to find a reasonable balance between
     authority and cooperation - between "policy" and "guidelines."  If
     so, the participants in the debate in FN_SYSOP are on a productive
     path.  Though sharply disagreeing on specifics, the participants
     seem willing to hear each other out and weigh contrary arguments.
     Perhaps a new and better Fidonet is taking shape there...

     My EchoMail hurts me when I stick it in my eye.
     By Paul Lentz [1:124/5025]

     What a state Zone1 echomail is in. We've ended up with four systems
     that don't work together, don't do things the same way, and don't
     pay attention to what the others are doing anyway. We have the
     EchoList, the NAB, the WWB, and the Z1B. At least 1 of the 3 major
     Echomail distribution systems in Zone1 will not kill an echo unless
     it's requested by the moderator, regardless of how dead the thing
     is. It's clear they ignore whether an echo is elisted or not, since
     echos live on for months, long after everybody has left the party.

     People collect echos like seashells, but in the end you can only
     hear the sea when you hold most of them up to your ear, cause
     there's no one talking there, that's for sure. In alot of these
     cases no one cared enough about the echo to worry about updating the
     elisting, so it is snatched up to "save" it from the quiet dignity
     of death. Also, echos are easily created and backboned when someone
     dreams them up and then convince willing "Bone Hub Buds" to ask for
     inclusion, even though no one has ever showed an interest to discuss
     the topics at hand. Used to be that echos were created because there
     was a need for them, like that people were discussing it in a
     general echo and found it more reasonable to move to a more specific
     echo. Ok, at least now there's a meeting place should that subject
     come up. Generally, people stay away in droves.

     A miserable scenario occurs with the wait end nodes go through for a
     newly areafixed echo to have something, *ANYTHING*, posted in it.
     This can go on for weeks. Maybe the spam on the internet would help
     the traffic level in some echos... we should consider this idea<g>.
     It would be much better to get 70 messages a day per echo,
     supposedly written by 70 different 17 year old girls that are very
     sick... with the HOTS!... you just need to get yourself over to
     www.buttcrazy.com and they'll agree to have sex with you (even you
     woman persons).

     Some echos are created to spite someone, or to make fun, and hang
     around as a six-month joke that was funny once, a long time ago.

     It's also sad that instead of finding some way of working together,
     these various Zone1 distrution systems, and the ZEC and a good
     majority of Fidonet sysops still feel that "vote with your feet" and
     "you are free to choose your feed from any source" are viable
     statements to make, since there is no answer to why things are done
     (or not done) the way they are done. It's no longer vote with your
     feet... it's use your feet to run around chasing down an echo that
     works well and is available where you want/need it to be, or just
     vote with a yawn, `cause you're tired of the whole thing.

     You know, that "www.HampsterDance.com" thing really is fun after
     all!  :-)

     Why were the last three editions of Fidonews released simultaneously
     to the echo FIDONEWS on March 30th?  You can lay the blame on the
     inattentiveness of your editor <sigh>.

     Each Monday's edition of Fidonews is normally published on the
     preceding Sunday night before midnight.  The initial stages of
     publication are manual - throughout the week as articles are sent
     here via internet or netmail, I'll save them as ASCII files and then
     use a text editor to strip lines added by mail processors and, if
     necessary, reformat the text to fit the requirements of the software
     which assembles the newsletter.

     On Sunday night, I'll compile a pre-release copy of the Fidonews zip
     file.  This is examined for correctness and completeness and
     recompiled as many times as is necessary to get it right.  Normally
     by 10PM I'll have the archive in it's final form, ready for
     distribution.

     Distribution is automated and consists of the following operations:

     1.  The final zip file is hatched into the FILEBONE for distribution
         throughout Fidonet.

     2.  An email message with a Mime (base 64) file attachment of the
         zip archive is prepared.  This is distributed over the internet
         to a small mailing list.  One of these copies is sent to
         FIDONEWS.ORG and converted by Jim Barchuk into an HTML version
         accessible to a WEB browser.

     3.  The newsletter itself is formatted into echomail messages and
         distributed via the echo FIDONEWS.

     This third step is what failed three weeks ago.  I use a utility
     donated by Peter Karlsson to format Fidonews into echomail messages.
     The output of his utility is in PKT format ready for tossing.
     Unfortunately, a month ago the trial period for my Shareware tosser,
     Fastecho, expired.  I attempted to register via the U.S. Support
     BBS, only to find it not in existence any longer.  The registration
     information listed a WEB site which handles registration, but when I
     logged on the WEB site didn't even mention Fastecho, let alone offer
     a means of registration.

     Since the mailer announced that it would stop operating in 30 days
     and to buy more time until I could find out if the product was still
     supported or else change all my message bases from JAM format to
     SQUISH format (to use Squish as my tosser), I reinstalled the
     shareware archive to another directory.  Unfortunately, I forgot to
     FIDONEWS 17-14               Page 5                    3 Apr 2000


     change the batch files which control distribution of Fidonews, and I
     was sending the PKTs for the FIDONEWS echo to the old directory
     which was no longer being used by the tosser.

     So three editions of Fidonews were not published in the FIDONEWS
     in a timely manner, but released simultaneously on March 30th when
     Dale Ship informed me of my error.

     What: Welcome to Michael Lynn's Homepage
     Where:http://www.people.unt.edu/~mikelynn/.


     You're probably wondering what this personal web page has to do with
     Fidonet and BBS. Two things....

     It's an Amiga computer page
     It's a link to the Bard's Tavern Homepage at:
     http://www.people.unt.edu/~mikelynn/bards.html

     Michael's page starts with a little about himself and his work.
     There's an introduction to the BBS page with link. Also mentioned is
     the fact that he is an Amiga tech. Below this are links to Amiga
     pages as well as links to interests of Michael's.

     Clicking on the link to the Bard's Tavern Homepage, you find
     yourself at a page that gives a description of the BBS and such.
     Since Michael is so good at telling this and the page is mostly
     text, I'll let him do the talking. :) Here's the cut & paste:

     ----

     Bard's Tavern Info Page

     If you have a modem and are interested you can connect to the Bard's
     Tavern via terminal by calling (940)243-5110, this number is GTE
     metro. The Tavern is a member of both Fidonet and DALNET bbs
     networks and will soon join C-Link. My Fidonet address is
     michael.lynn@1:393/7.0 or via Dalnet michael lynn@2001/2010/8.0 For
     more information on the local bbs scene click on over to the Denton
     Area BBS List. This fantastic guide is maintained by Walter Bowen of
     the Mezzanine BBS.

     The Bard's Tavern is Denton's only Amiga bbs in addition to being
     one of it's oldest, it was originally started to be a source for
     Amiga support in North Texas, since then it has become much more.
     Now all platforms are welcome and the Tavern is considered a source
     for great multi-platform multimedia files like jpeg, mpeg, s3m, xm,
     mp3, and mod files. If files are not your thing the bbs offers
     dozens of online games and interesting text files in addition to
     networked message areas that are similar to internet news. The
     Bard's Tavern DOES NOT CARRY ADULT SOFTWARE OR PIRATED FILES and has
     no plans to do so in the future, the bbs is designed for a mature
     but not necessarily adult crowd. Graphic artists and digital
     musicians are especially welcomed. Science fiction and anime are
     also an area of shared interest for our online community.

     ----

     As you can see Michael tells it pretty well. :)  Below this section
     is more text and a few small graphics giving more information about
     the software and hardware used as well as links to sources and other
     vendors.

     The one thing that stood out was the lack of graphics. I'm not
     complaining and I'll again let Michael explain.

     ----
     As with all my pages, I have tried to make this as lean as possible
     with minimal graphics for fast loads for those of you who access the
     net via modem. I also DO NOT plan to add frames or animated .gif's.

     ----

     Nice page and very informational. Check it out if you're into Amiga
     computers and if you want to see what an Amiga BBS looks and works
     like, call the Bard's Tavern. :)


     Wishing everybody well,

     Also, as information is provided to me, I will be adding a
     latency field to each node, which is defined as the maximum
     time between when the message is received, and when it is
     sent on to other nodes, or available to be sent onward,
     defined in minutes. A latency of ! implies that there is an
     immediate response, and an attempt to deliver immediately
