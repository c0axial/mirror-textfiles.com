                   PROPOSAL FOR (YET) ANOTHER NEW NET

     Within the last few months, I've seen a few new nets form as
     "alternatives" to Fidonet.  The problem with many of these, in
     my view, is that they are almost "special interest" nets... for
     example, Alternet is the "burnouts" net with a medieval motiff
     (some say "Dungeons and Dragons").  The "Good Egg Net" is for
     those who want a return to the simpler days of Fidonet, and has
     a "National Egg Commissioner"  and various titles like that.
     Personally, the thought of joining a net and having to refer to
     those higher in the organization as the Duke or Duchess of
     such-and-such, or Egg Inspector so-and-so, does not really
     appeal to me.  These games are fine for those who enjoy them
     (and this is not a slam against those who do), but it's just not
     my cup of tea.  I'd guess I prefer a net that's run on a
     slightly more businesslike basis.

     At the same time, I see many problems in Fidonet that come about
     because the workings of Fidonet are often based on assumptions
     that are not totally valid, and policies that were formulated
     back in the days before echomail even existed.  For that reason,
     I'd like to propose a new net to be called "LCRNET".   LCR
     Stands for "LEAST COST ROUTING" and describes the most basic
     guiding principle behind this new net... namely, the primary
     purpose of this net will be to enable sysops to move netmail and
     echomail as inexpensively as possible.  To this end, any
     tradition or policy that interferes with the concept of Least
     Cost Routing will be disposed of post haste.

     In the next few paragraphs, I'd like to outline just a few
     specifics of this proposal.  I want to find out if anyone else
     is interested in such a net, and if so, solicit ideas for the
     best way to implement it.


     HOW DOES LCRNET DIFFER FROM FIDONET?

     LCRNET will make some major breaks with time-honored Fidonet
     conventions, but where possible we want to retain enough
     compatibility with Fidonet that we can still pass netmail and
     echoes back and forth.  Unfortunately, unless someone can come
     up with a better idea, the only way that I can see to accomplish
     this is to follow the precedent set by the other "alternative"
     nets that have gone before, and assign LCRNET a separate "zone"
     number.  The reason for doing this is that echomail can then be
     passed through "zonegates" which will have the capability to
     produce echomail packets in a format acceptable to Fidonet
     nodes, should any "conversion" be required.
     FidoNews 5-29                Page 2                   18 Jul 1988


     NO REGIONS

     Regions are a political division within Fidonet.  They are not
     used by any echomail or netmail processor for mail routing.  It
     appears that in Fidonet regional divisions have actually worked
     against Least Cost Routing.  The reason for this is that some
     regional coordinators see their regions as sort of their own
     little fiefdoms, and regard regional boundaries as sacred.  But
     for many sysops, the least expensive source for echomail may
     well be on the other side of the artificially-created regional
     boundary.  Thus, I feel that regional divisions have proven to
     be counter-productive to the efficient operation of the net, and
     propose that the whole concept of Regions be done away with.

     ZONES TO BE GATEWAYS TO OTHER NETS

     Zones, even though on a higher level than nets, are still
     basically artificial geographic divisions.  I feel that
     "zonegates" can be more useful as gateways to other nets
     (Fidonet, Alternet, FamilyNet, Eggnet, etc.).  However, this is
     not cast in stone, and if anyone can provide compelling reasons
     for duplicating Fidonet's zone usage in LCRNET, we can certain
     consider that aspect of mail addressing.  Please note that the
     country in which a net is located can be determined from the net
     number if the numbering plan described in the next paragraph if
     adopted.

     NET NUMBERS TO BE FOUR DIGIT NUMBERS

     I have two reasons for this.  One is that by using four digit
     numbers for nets, it will make it much easier to interface
     LCRNET with Fidonet, which generally uses three-digit zone
     numbers.  The other reason is that we can specify that the first
     digits of the net number will duplicate the telephone country
     code for the net where the country is located, thus giving us
     some opportunity for deterining where a node is geographically
     located should this become desirable.  For example:

     Net 1xxx = United States & Canada....  1000 possible net numbers
     Net 61xx = Australia.... 100 possible net numbers
     Net 507x = Panama.... 10 possible net numbers

     Net numbers ending in "99" (for countries with one digit country
     codes) or "9" (for countries with two or three digit country
     codes) will be reserved for point nets.  These numbers will
     never appear in the nodelist and thus can be reused for
     different point nets at various locations throughout a country.
     They are simply left unassigned as a convenience so that any
     sysop can create a point net and assign a net number with the
     assurance that this number will never be used by any "real" net.

     NO GEOGRAPHIC RESTRICTIONS ON NETS

     Normally, a net will encompass the local calling area of a city,
     plus some outlying nodes that may or may not be able to call
     into the city with a local call.  But in LCRNET, the sysop of
     FidoNews 5-29                Page 3                   18 Jul 1988


     any given node may join any net he chooses to, providing the net
     host is willing to allow him in.  Joining a net at some distance
     away because it is a low-cost or no-cost call to that location
     is specifically permitted, and even encouraged.

     By the same token, there will be no prohibition against having
     more than one net covering the same geographic area.  LCRNET is
     not a geographically-driven net... cost is the driving factor.
     Nodes can even join nets in other countries if they wish (in
     which case they will use the net number of their net host).
     This is to avoid restricting a node that may have access to a
     special calling service (for example, a foreign exchange line to
     a distant city) from joining a net in that distant city, but it
     is also designed to avoid the situation where a net host can
     become overbearing on the nodes under him.  There are no
     monopolies in LCRNET, any node is free to join any net that will
     take him in.

     Net hosts in LCRNET should be willing to take in nodes outside
     their local geographic area so long as it does not increase
     their costs and so long as the node has a reasonably good reason
     for wanting to join.  A "personality conflict" with the local
     net host *may* be considered good reason for him to join another
     net, however, net hosts are not required to take in nodes that
     have proven themselves to be "twits" in other nets.


     SOFTWARE BREAKS WITH FIDONET

     Certain assumptions that were considered valid in Fidonet are
     specifically NOT valid in LCRNET.  These include:

     Invalid assumption #1:  File attaches are never forwarded.

     In LCRNET, a good sysop will try to provide a way to forward
     file attaches (netmail messages with files attached) so long as
     they do not increase his costs.  In other words, file attaches
     need not be forwarded if the sysop is paying a per-minute toll
     charge to send netmail, but local file attaches (and those that
     can be sent via PC Pursuit and similar services) SHOULD be
     forwarded to the destination node.  This may in some cases
     require the use of software that is not yet available, so this
     goal may not be attained immediately.  Please note that just
     because the capability to forward file attaches is present does
     not mean it should be used.  Anyone planning to forward a very
     large file, or to forward files on a regular basis, should
     probably obtain permission first from the sysops of the systems
     through which such files will pass.

     Invalid assumption #2:  ARCA and ARCE are the "standard" ARCing
     and deARCing programs.

     ARCA and some versions of ARCE do NOT support "squashing" which
     is the most efficient method of packing many netmail archives.
     Therefore, in LCRNET the "standard" programs will be PKARC and
     PKXARC.  Some sysops may not be able to use PKARC during the
     FidoNews 5-29                Page 4                   18 Jul 1988


     mail packing process so they may continue to use ARCA as an
     interim measure, but they should at least try to use PKXARC to
     unARC files.  Many mail tossers now allow the option of using
     PKXARC to unpack files, and conversion programs (e.g. ARC2PK)
     are available for use with other systems (such as Opus 1.03b).
     Programs that are totally incapable of at least unARCing
     "squashed" archives shall be considered non-standard in LCRNET.

     Invaild assumption #3:  Netmail (or matrix mail, as it is
     sometimes called) is always sent direct, or from net host to net
     host.  In LCRNET, it is considered desirable to send messages at
     the lowest possible cost.  Therefore, within the United States
     all Net Hosts that are not themselves PC Pursuitable shall make
     arrangements to "home" their mail traffic to a node in a PC
     Pursuitable city (net hosts in other countries, particularly
     those in Canada, may optionally elect to do this as well).  When
     this is done, the PC Pursuitable node to which netmail traffic
     for this net can be routed should be listed under an AI: flag in
     the nodelist comment field (see NODELIST FLAGS).  Since LCRNET
     attempts to route netmail messages over "no cost" routes, or at
     very least along with regular echomail packets, the use of
     software that allows "return receipts" to be generated shall be
     considered a desirable feature.

     One other break with Fidonet is that the use of "tiny" SEEN-BY
     lines and tight control over network topologies will be
     encouraged.  Sending duplicate messages around the net shall be
     considered an EXTREMELY undesirable action.  Therefore, all
     nodes carrying echomail shall, whenever possible, use software
     that supports the ^APATH: line (e.g. ConfMail) so that the
     source of duplicate messages can be easily determined.  In
     addition, NO NODE SHALL RECEIVE THE SAME ECHO FROM TWO DIFFERENT
     FEEDS, unless he specifically informs BOTH feeds of what he is
     doing and they BOTH authorize it, and steps are taken to avoid
     the introduction of DUPE messages into the net.


     POLITICAL BREAKS WITH FIDONET

     I would like to leave politics out of LCRNET as much as
     possible.  This is one reason I advocate eliminating Regions, as
     these simply create small fiefdoms that tend to give certain
     individuals too much power.  In addition, I advocate the
     following breaks with Fidonet:

     CONFERENCE MODERATORS TO BE SUPREME OVER THEIR CONFERENCES

     In LCRNET, a conference moderator has more authority and more
     responsibility than in Fidonet.  In LCRNET, the moderator shall
     try to keep an accurate topology map of his conference, and to
     know at all times where a given node is receiving the conference
     from, and who he is sending it to.  The only exception to this
     is that if one node is feeding the conference to other nodes in
     a given net, the conference moderator need not be informed of
     those who add and drop the conference within the net.

     FidoNews 5-29                Page 5                   18 Jul 1988


     Any LCRNET node receiving a conference shall provide a comple
     list of the nodes he is receiving the conference from, or that
     he is sending the conference to, at the request of the
     moderator.

     The conference moderator may, for good cause, rename a
     conference (to avoid name confusion with another conference, or
     to facilitate merging the conference with another of the same
     name) and/or direct that links to a particular node be cut.
     Valid reasons for cutting nodes to a link could include any of
     the following:

     1) Messages originate from that node that contain foul language.
     Those who believe in total freedom of speech and the right to
     say anything, anywhere, at any time will NOT be happy in LCRNET
     and are encouraged NOT to join.  The intent is that LCRNET will
     be more like Alternet than Fidonet in this regard.  Profanity
     and foul language shall normally be considered bad behaviour in
     LCRNET unless a conference moderator specifically allows them in
     a given conference.  HOWEVER, no LCRNET node shall under any
     circumstances be required to carry or pass along an echo in
     which profanity or foul language are allowed.

     2) Messages originate from a node that contain personal attacks
     on others.  It is one thing to disagree with someone else's
     viewpoints, quite another to attack their intelligence or
     background, etc.  As with foul language, personal attacks shall
     normally be considered bad behaviour in LCRNET, and no LCRNET
     node shall under any circumstances be required to carry or pass
     along an echo in which they are tolerated.

     3) Messages originate from a node that consistently violate the
     stated rules of an echo.  Also, a conference moderator is not
     required to put up with users that consistently "test the
     limits" of the moderator's patience by trying to see how close
     they can come to breaking a rule without actually breaking it
     (for example, using "veiled" profainty in which the meaning is
     fairly obvious, or "near" personal attacks).

     4) Messages originate from a node that contain illegal
     information (stolen credit card numbers, etc.), that are
     patently obscene, or that contain remarks designed to stir up
     hatred or advocate violence between people of different races,
     religions, etc.  These types of messages are specifically NOT
     ALLOWED in LCRNET.  Note that in regard to illegal information,
     a message must actually CONTAIN illegal information to violate
     this rule.  For example, a message that states "I think everyone
     ought to use stolen credit cards" would not violate THIS rule,
     though it might violate a posted rule of the conference in
     question.  But a message that CONTAINED stolen credit card
     numbers WOULD violate this rule.

     5) In the case of religious or political echoes that are
     intended as "meeting places" for people of like mind, links may
     be cut to nodes that constantly allow messages that agitate
     against these beliefs.  For example, if a conference were set up
     FidoNews 5-29                Page 6                   18 Jul 1988


     for the express purpose of discussing how best to implement the
     Strategic Defense Initiative, a node that consistantly allows
     messages to be posted discouraging the whole concept, advocating
     a nuclear freeze, etc. could be cut from the conference.  The
     test here shall be whether the conference is set up primarily
     for people of like mind to share thoughts and ideas, or whether
     the conference is considered "open to unbelievers".  However,
     even in the latter case, a node may be cut for specific repeated
     violations of conference rules.

     6) Links may be cut to a node if the Sysop of that node refuses
     the legitimate request of the conference moderator to provide a
     list of nodes that he is receiving the conference from and
     sending the conference to.  The conference moderator must have
     this information available in order to track down the source of
     duplicate messages, or messages that consistently violate the
     rules of LCRNET or of the echo itself.  However, conference
     moderators shall not pass out this information to others if the
     Sysop requests that such information be kept confidential,
     unless such disclosure is necessary to prove that a rule
     violation has occurred when cutting links to that node.

     ECHOES CARRIED ON LCRNET DO NOT AUTOMATICALLY BECOME "PUBLIC
     DOMAIN"

     The one and only purpose of this statement is to assure
     conference moderators that they are allowed to pull their
     conferences OFF of LCRNET should they feel the absolute need to
     do so.  We hope that the greater authority afforded to
     moderators on LCRNET would never make this necessary, but a
     moderator does have the right to do this if he or she feels it
     necessary.

     LCRNET echoes may NOT be carried by nodes belonging to any other
     net (Star or backbone nodes in particular) unless they agree to
     this condition.

     ECHOMAIL HUBS MAY NOT CUT ECHO FEEDS FOR POLITICAL REASONS

     In Fidonet the situation has sometimes come up where a node will
     cut all echomail feeds to another node because of some
     disagreement between the two sysops.  Thus, control over
     echomail feeds becomes a form of "blackmail" over another sysop.
     This sort of thing is considered EXTREMELY bad behaviour in
     LCRNET.  Generally speaking, no LCRNET node is required to bring
     any given conference into an area, but when it does bring in a
     conference and offers it to other nodes, it must offer it on a
     non-discriminatory basis.  The only valid reasons for refusing
     to send a conference to a node are as follows:

     1) The conference moderator has directed that links to this node
     for a particular conference be cut, as specified above.

     2) Providing the conference would cause the node to incur
     additional costs.  Obviously, this is not valid if the
     conference can be sent via a flat-rate medium such as PC
     FidoNews 5-29                Page 7                   18 Jul 1988


     Pursuit, or if the receiving node offers to poll for the echoes.

     3) Technical limitations... for example, a node is running Opus
     software and is already sending a given echo to ten other nodes
     (the maximum allowed in Opus).  But if the node receiving the
     request for a feed is the ONLY no-cost source for that echo
     available to that node, some sort of arrangement should be made
     to try and accommodate that node.

     4) Technical problems at the receiving node... for example, no
     one is required to provide feeds to a node that constantly
     generates "dupe" messages.

     Please keep in mind that the primary motivation of LCRNET is to
     reduce costs for all involved.  Therefore, if you are the only
     no-cost source of an echo to a given node, and you refuse to
     provide the echo to that node, you should have a VERY good
     reason for the refusal.

     PASSING ON COSTS

     Nodes that wish to become Echomail hubs for a given area should
     be prepared to absorb the expenses incurred in that operation.
     This is not to imply that two or more nodes cannot share costs
     incurred in bringing echoes into an area, but this should be
     considered the exception rather than the rule.

     If a node is using a flat-rate service such as PC Pursuit to
     bring echoes into a given area and wishes to split the monthly
     cost with other nodes, it shall be divided equally among all
     nodes receiving the echoes.  For example, if one node is
     receiving echoes and distributing them to four other nodes, this
     means that five nodes are benefiting from the echoes, so each
     node should pay one-fifth of the monthly charge ($5 in the case
     of PC Pursuit at $25 per month).  Costs should not be assessed
     on number of echoes received since this discourages nodes from
     carrying new echoes.  Again, however, this type of cost sharing
     should be considered the exception rather than the norm
     (primarily since the person holding the flat-rate account can
     use it for non-BBS related activites, and thus derives greater
     benefit from it).  Cost sharing of non-flat-rate services (e.g.
     regular long distance charges) is officially discouraged because
     it almost invariably leads to arguments and hard feelings over
     whether everyone is paying their "fair share".


     NET HOSTS GOVERN AT THE PLEASURE OF THE NET SYSOPS

     Despite the cries for a "democracy" in Fidonet, I don't feel
     that net hosts should be subject to the necessity of
     "campaigning" and running a "popularity contest" periodically.
     Many sysops have stated they simply would not take a position
     under such circumstances.  However, nothing in the LCRNET rules
     will PREVENT the formation of democratically-governed nets,
     where the Net Host is elected by the sysops in the net, but in
     such cases the rules for such elections shall be decided by the
     FidoNews 5-29                Page 8                   18 Jul 1988


     net itself.  Please keep in mind, however, that nothing in
     LCRNET rules prevents the formation of two different nets that
     cover the same geographical area.  There are no monopolies in
     LCRNET!  Thus if a number of sysops feel that they cannot
     function under the current net host, and he or she cannot be
     persuaded to resign, those sysops are perfectly free to start
     another net.  However, things should not be allowed to
     deteriorate to the point where this is necessary if at all
     possible.  LCRNET should be a net of cooperation, not
     competition.  Net hosts who feel the need to dictate many rules
     or policies for their own net (in addition to those in this
     document) might be happier in another net.

     Above the Net level, there are no intermediates until you reach
     the national/international level.  I am open to suggestions for
     the type of organization we should have there.  However, any
     positions at those levels will be unpaid, volunteer positions.
     LCRNET will not hold conventions in fancy hotels, nor squander
     money.  There will be no "dues" to be in LCRNET, or any
     organization connected with LCRNET.  There will be no "poll tax"
     to vote on any issue facing LCRNET.  We do reserve the right to
     ask for voluntary contributions should that become necessary,
     but the word VOLUNTARY is emphasized... no coercion or pressure
     shall be put on anyone to "contribute", and no disparaging
     remarks shall be made about anyone because they did not
     contribute.

     In any vote held in LCRNET, the principle of "one person, one
     vote" shall be strictly adhered to.  That means that each sysop
     listed in the LCRNET nodelist gets one vote, regardless of the
     number of systems he may sysop.


     THE NODELIST

     The LCRNET nodelist will NOT be used as a political tool.  NO
     ONE shall be dropped from the LCRNET nodelist unless their node
     goes offline or is consistantly unreachable during the Fidonet
     Zone Mail Hour (which LCRNET nodes will be expected to observe
     until or unless we adopt a different mail hour).  A node shall
     NOT be dropped from the nodelist because of a personality
     conflict with someone else, however they may be dropped for
     consistant and pervasive violations of the rules in this
     document.  What this means is that unless somebody is such a
     blatent and obvious jerk that almost everybody in the net hates
     his guts, he will not be dropped from the nodelist.  Net hosts
     should be aware that anyone dropped from their net is perfectly
     free to apply to be included in another net.

     Conversely, however, since nets are not strictly geographically
     based, there will be no "independent" nodes in LCRNET.  A node
     that might be "independent" in another net should try to join a
     net in a major city (in the United States it would be preferable
     to join one based in a PC Pursuitable city).  This also gives us
     some control over "twit" sysops because if a sysop gains a
     really bad reputation, chances are that no net host will take
     FidoNews 5-29                Page 9                   18 Jul 1988


     him into his or her net (for very long, anyway).  Of course, the
     "twit" sysop can always start his own net, but a net by
     definition consists of MORE THAN ONE node (controlled by more
     than one sysop).

     Once again, if a net host takes an action that will cost someone
     else money (for example, dropping someone from a local net, thus
     forcing them to call long distance to pick up mail from another
     net) they should have a VERY good reason for doing so.

     NODELIST FLAGS

     We intend to expand the number of valid nodelist flags from
     those allowed in Fidonet, and are open to suggestions.  However,
     LCRNET will allow a specific new flag, as follows:

     AI:net[/node][,net[/node],net[/node]...]

     The net/node(s) listed are alternate nodes to which inbound mail
     can be sent.  These are nodes which either the sysop or his net
     host polls regularly.  LCRNET net hosts located in the United
     States but not in a PC Pursuit inbound area will be expected to
     use this flag to indicate at least the PC Pursuitable node on
     which they "home" for netmail traffic.  If only a single number
     is listed after the AI: designator, it will be taken as a net
     number and netmail can be directed to the net host of that net
     (net/0).  For example:

     AI:1234    is equivalent to    AI:1234/0

     Let's take a typical situation.  Node 1777/80 and his net host,
     1777/0 are in a non-PC Pursuitable city and in addition, 1777/0
     is not a PC Pursuit user.  However, he regularly picks up echoes
     from 1876/0, who IS a PC Pursuit user and who regularly calls
     1323/5 in a PC Pursuitable city to pick up echoes.  Here's how
     the AI: field might read for each of these nodes:

     1777/80 - AI:1876,1323/5  -  In this case, 1777/80 can receive
     netmail sent to 1777/0 (his normal inbound host, which is
     assumed), 1876/0, 1323/5, or 1323/0 (the net host for 1323/5).

     1777/0 - Same as for 1777/80, since he can receive from the same
     nodes.

     1876/0 - AI:1323/5 - In this case, 1876/0 would list the PC
     Pursuitable node that he polls regularly.  Mail for him could be
     sent to 1323/5 or 1323/0 (the net host for 1323/0).

     1323/5 would not be required to use an AI: in the nodelist,
     since he's in a PC Pursuitable city.

     Now let's see how the actual routing of incoming netmail would
     be handled.  Let's assume a "worst case" situation, where a
     piece of netmail intended for 1777/80 is sent to 1323/0.

     1323/0 would have a statement in its routing control file
     FidoNews 5-29                Page 10                  18 Jul 1988


     similar to this:
     ArcCM 1323/5 1876/ALL 1777/ALL
     This would route the mail for net 1777 to 1323/5.

     1323/5 would have a statement in its routing control file like
     this:
     ArcHold 1876/0 1876/ALL 1777/ALL
     This would route the mail for net 1777 to 1876/0.

     1876/0 would have a statement like this:
     ArcHold 1777/0 1777/ALL
     This would send the mail for net 1777 to the Net 1777 host,
     where it would finally get set to 1777/80.

     Note that in this case, the mail could pass through several
     systems before reaching its destination.  This is why all net
     hosts at least are encouraged to "home" directly on PC
     Pursuitable cities whenever this can be done without incurring
     additional expense.

     In Fidonet, speed of mail delivery is considered of primary
     importance, regardless of the expense.  In LCRNET, cost is the
     driving factor.  This is one major difference between the two
     nets.  Of course, there is nothing to prevent an LCRNET sysop
     from directly crashing messages to another system without
     routing them, so really important messages can always be sent
     immediately, albeit at higher cost.

     MODEM TYPE FLAGS

     The use of the following modem type flags will be specifically
     allowed in the nodelist comment field:

     HAY       Hayes V series
     HST       USRobotics HST
     MAX       Microcom AX/9624c
     PEP       Telebit Trailblazer
     MNP       MNP error correction protocol available

     Further suggestions are welcome.

     CONTINUOUS MAIL

     In LCRNET, the ability to send and receive continuous mail shall
     be considered the norm (except where hours of operation are
     given).  Software that does NOT have this ability shall be so
     indicated by the special nodelist flag NC (for Non-Continuous).
     As an interim measure, the CM: flag may be used by all systems
     that can receive mail continuously (24 hours a day) in order to
     be compatible with existing nodelist processors.  It is hoped
     that new software can be written for use with LCRNET that will
     recognize and properly process the new nodelist flags.


     STATEMENT ON "POINTS" AND THEIR PURPOSE

     FidoNews 5-29                Page 11                  18 Jul 1988


     In LCRNET, a "point" is a regular BBS user who calls into a BBS
     using software that will pick up the echoes he wishes to read,
     and allows him to read and reply to those echoes offline.  The
     main difference in LCRNET Is that here it is quite acceptable
     for the BBS operator to make the outgoing call to the "point" on
     a prearranged schedule, if by doing so a lower cost to the user
     can be achieved.  The BBS operator may recover any long distance
     costs incurred in doing this from the "point" user.

     BBS operators are never "points".  If a BBS operator is unable
     or unwilling to observe the Zone Mail Hour but would otherwise
     qualify to be in the nodelist, he or she should be listed as a
     private, unlisted node.  No one who is running compatible
     software shall be denied listing in the LCRNET nodelist just
     because they are running a private node that is not available to
     the general public.


     INTERCONNECTIONS WITH OTHER NETS

     The main purpose of LCRNET is to encourage communications at the
     lowest possible cost.  Therefore, interconnections with other
     nets shall be encouraged.  However, wherever possible these
     shall take place through "gateway" systems wherever echomail is
     involved (except for local or private conferences circulated to
     a very small or tightly controlled group of nodes).  There are
     two reasons for this:  One is to prevent "dupe" messages from
     flowing from one system into another.  If all messages between
     the two nets pass through a single "gateway" system, then the
     dupe killer at that system should prevent any duplicate messages
     from entering the other net.  The other reason is that should
     the quality of the conference begin to deteriorate on the other
     net to the point where messages coming from that net
     consistantly violate LCRNET rules, or are mostly irrelevant to
     the topic of discussion, the link can be easily cut (although
     this is something that would NOT be done suddenly and without
     warning).

     It is realized that in the initial stages of setting up LCRNET,
     most sysops will continue to get echo conferences through the
     same Fidonet feeds that they always have.  In keeping with the
     spirit of LCRNET, no sysop will be forced to drop any
     independent feed of an echo that he is getting from Fidonet or
     any other net.  He MAY be asked, however, not to feed this echo
     to other LCRNET nodes, particularly where by doing so "dupe"
     messages are being created.  As always, cost will be the
     motivating factor in deciding how echoes are distributed.


     MESSAGE CONTENT (FLAMES, ETC.)

     Most of the restrictions on message content have already been
     covered.  However, there are certain people who can't seem to
     hold a discussion without resorting to FLAMES, personal attacks,
     and so on.  We would prefer these people NOT attemt to join
     LCRNET, because we want to have a friendly, happy and sharing
     FidoNews 5-29                Page 12                  18 Jul 1988


     net.  If you are the type of Sysop who has been embarrassed to
     let your family read the echomail areas on your BBS because of
     some of the childish attitudes displayed there, you will
     probably be welcome in LCRNET.

     Because nets are not geographically restricted, and there are no
     regional coordinators of any kind, much of the necessity for
     FLAMES should be eliminated.  If you have a problem with the Net
     host, join another net, or form your own.  If you have a problem
     with the national leadership, tough toenails... there are other
     nets around.  In LCRNET we want to give everyone choices so that
     if you find an individual particular abrasive, you can simply
     ignore him (which will probably infuriate him more than flaming
     at him anyway... such individuals usually crave attention, even
     if it's negative).  There are no monopolies in LCRNET.  Most of
     the power in LCRNET will rest with the net hosts.  It's sort of
     like choosing a hamburger joint for lunch... if you find the
     people are consistantly rude in one, you find another.  If the
     other happens to be ten blocks farther away and charges 10 cents
     more per burger, then you have to decide which is more
     objectionable to you.  What you don't do is stand outside of one
     or the other and yell and scream and stomp and call the manager
     names... that will get you nowhere fast... about as far as
     FLAMES in LCRNET will get you.

     We want LCRNET to be a nice, discussion oriented net, where
     common courtesy and politeness are expected and practiced.

     PRIVATE MESSAGES

     The official position of LCRNET will be that LCRNET does *NOT*
     support the transmission of "private" or "confidential" mail.
     Mail may be intercepted at any point along its path and read by
     persons other than the intended recipient.  LCRNET should not be
     used to transmit messages of a private or confidential nature.


     TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES

     We would like for LCRNET to be the network of choice for
     innovators... those who don't feel constrained by the
     established norms in software and hardware, for example.  Of
     course, if you are designing software for use in the net, you
     should attempt to make it as compatible as possible with
     existing software... after all, it wouldn't do to design a
     program to toss echomail packets that no other program can read!
     But it's also okay to make a new program that's "downward
     compatible" with existing programs.

     We'd also like to encourage the use of means of communications
     other than standard telephone lines, especially those means that
     can lower the cost of communications.  We're waiting for the day
     that all the echomail hubs can stick up a $100 Ku-band satellite
     dish and simutaneously receive the "4 A.M.  National Echomail
     Feed" every morning.  In the meantime, experiments with such
     items as radio modems, microwave or infrared transmission,
     FidoNews 5-29                Page 13                  18 Jul 1988


     direct tie-ins to packet networks, moon bounce, or anything else
     folks might want to try are encouraged in LCRNET.  You will not
     find a "Technical Standards Committee" here telling you that
     "you can't do that because it will obsolete the piece of
     software I wrote three years ago."  Again, this does not imply
     that you should be TRYING to "break" existing software, but we
     certainly are open to whatever you may be doing... particularly
     if it will wind up saving money for sysops.


     WANT TO JOIN US?

     If you think you'd be interested in being part of LCRNET, please
     send Netmail to Jack Decker at 154/8.  Send flames to NUL.  I
     know some of you detest the formation of new nets, and frankly,
     I couldn't care less.  Fidonet long ago stopped being responsive
     to the needs of the "average sysop", and recently seems to have
     become a haven for petty self-appointed demagogues.  We want to
     provide an alternative to that sort of nonsense.

     If enough interest is expressed, we will form this net and issue
     a nodelist.  If you'd like to be a net host in this net, please
     so indicate and also indicate your choice for a net number
     (remember that it must be a four digit number that begins with
     your country's telephone country code).

     Constructive suggestions and criticisms (other than "don't do
     this"... if there's enough interest we will, if there's not, we
     won't) will be welcome and will be considered!  And if anyone
     with writing skills would care to polish this document into a
     basic LCRNET policy document, it would be very much appreciated.
     Your input is welcomed.  If you feel that we should go ahead
     with this, then at this point I especially need input on what
     sort of national leadership we should have.  My own preference
     is for a rather loose, informal organization at the top that
     would perhaps only be responsible for getting out the nodelist
     and mediating any disputes in regard to LCRNET rules, but I'm
     certainly very open to other suggestions!

     We have started an echo called LCRNET (naturally) which is
     hubbed off of Fidonet node 154/7 (a PC Pursuitable node) for
     further discussion.  This echo is is just starting and if you
     are interested in seeing this proposal inplemented and would
     like to be part of such an echo, please send netmail.

     One other point... I can almost bet that once this proposal hits
     the wires, somebody's going to accuse me of trying to start my
     own little fiefdom.  Well, I'm not going to spend a lot of time
     debating with such people, I will just simply say that it isn't
     true, but you can believe it if you want to.  You can also
     believe the earth is flat if you want to.  However, I do *not*
     see myself in a leadership position in LCRNET... there are many
     others who have much better organizational talents that could
     probably do a much better job of running such an organization
     (to whatever extent that it needs anyone to "run" it at all).  I
     have been around Fidonet long enough to realize that there's no
     FidoNews 5-29                Page 14                  18 Jul 1988


     way I'm going to make this proposal without getting a few
     personal attacks, but I would much rather see the debate center
     on the actual proposal itself.  And if anyone in Fidonet or any
     other net would care to "borrow" any ideas from this document,
     by all means please feel free to do so.  If all this document
     accomplishes is to give someone in another net some ideas for
     their net, then it will have served a useful purpose.

                     Toward a Virus Fee FidoNet
                                 by
                       Bob Hartman 1:132/101.1

          In the  interest of  helping people make sure that the
     programs which  they use are free from viruses, I have made
     the following  list.   This list  is the  output from PKARC
     version 3.6 on various archives that I KNOW are virus free.
     I know  this because  I was  the person  that  created  the
     archives, and  compiled the  original programs within them.
     The command used to create the list was:

          PKARC V archive > output

          I then  edited the  output to  fit  into  FidoNews  by
     deleting some  of the information which is unimporant (like
     the method  of archiving).  If you do the same command, and
     compare to  the output  below, be wary of any program which
     does not  match the  numbers below  EXACTLY!   I would even
     appreciate being warned of any such mismatches.

                           XlaxNode Version 2.10

     XlaxNode Version 2.10 is now available for general release.

     XlaxNode is a high performance replacement for a number of
     popular nodelist utilities.  The raw nodelist is compiled
     directly to Opus 1.0x, Opus 1.1x, Binkley, QuickBBS and/or Seadog
     format in a single step.  No intermediate files or programs are
     needed.  All sorts are internal.

     Xlax_210.Arc (151K) is available for file request from the
     following nodes.  Unless otherwise noted, they are 2400 baud and
     accept file requests from one hour after NMH to one hour before
     NMH.  All are Pursuitable via D/FLMIA.

           135/4
           135/8       HST-9600 Baud
           135/10
           135/11      Requests honored 0700-0100 EDT; HST-9600 Baud
           135/27      1200 only
           135/35      1200 only
           135/41

     XlaxNode emulates almost all of the functions of XlatList,
     OpusNode, NLComp, PCPFix, PCPExch, PCPExch2, QNode and ParseLst.
     XlaxNode also adds features not found in any of these programs.
     Processing is typically two to five times faster than these
     programs.

     Users of previous versions will find a number of improvements.
     Version 2.10 is smaller and, for many options, faster.  A number
     of bugs have been fixed.  QuickBBS and Binkley NodeList.Ext
     support has been added.  One NodeList.Idx file can be shared by
     all three data files.  Any or all of the output files can be
     created in a single pass.

     The nodelists can be tailored, selecting the zones and nets
     desired.  Output can range from a single net to the entire
     nodelist.

     Support for multi-zone nodelists has been enhanced.  The Opus
     1.1x message and call cost fields are supported.

     PC Pursuit processing can be enabled or disabled for individual
     output files.  2400 baud script support has been improved.

     The companion program, XlaxDiff, included in the archive, applies
     the weekly NodeDiff update file.

     The license permits a thirty day trial period, after which a $10
     per node fee is required.
