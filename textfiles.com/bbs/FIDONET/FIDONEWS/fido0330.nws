     =================================================================

     This  week's  guest  editorial  is  by  Ron Chapple of 17/36,  in
     Victoria, British Columbia.

                 Have You the Right to Withold Information?


     Do we have the right to information?  Is someone immoral if  they
     withhold  information  from  me?   Peter  de  Jager  asked  these
     questions in FidoNews 3:22 and  concluded  that  even  death  can
     occur   as   the  result  of  withholding  information  with  the
     withholder  being  blameless!  I  would  be  interested  to  know
     whether  Mr.  de  Jager perceives criminal negligence in the same
     way as a court of law.  Mr.  de Jager has made some  far-reaching
     conclusions  based  primarily  on  the  cost  of  collecting  and
     processing data.

     He describes the cost of the processing of data into  information
     as  "energy".  The  logic  of  the  arguments  used to defend the
     conclusions is  clear  enough:  the  collector  and  supplier  of
     processed  data has expended energy and therefore the user of the
     processed data  must  pay  the  energy  cost  (no  doubt  plus  a
     reasonable profit) to access the information.

     Despite  his  initial  questions,  what  is  missing from Mr.  de
     Jager's discussion is,  in fact,  the whole question of morality.
     Furthermore,  the  estimation of energy costs is insufficient and
     misplaced.

     Let us deal with a few examples  of  energy  cost  and  morality.
     Consider  the  case of a child crossing a street in the path of a
     vehicle.  It no doubt would cost some energy to shout or to  dash
     out  to  save  the child,  but what is your moral position if you
     don't?  Collecting the data in this case would  not  seem  to  be
     costly,  but ask any parent of a small child,  whether it is your
     own child or another's,  where life is even possibly at risk  you
     SPEND  the  energy  regardless  and  frequently.   You  have  the
     information,  the fact that you are not likely to convert it into
     cash  isn't  the  point.  The point is that someone else needs it
     and you are wrong if you don't provide  it.  If,  on  an  evening
     stroll,  you see flames through a window you know what your moral
     obligations are; at the very least you must turn in an alarm.  If
     you demand a reward before doing so then you aren't a  member  of
     the human race.

     Lest  these  examples  be  accused  of the fallacy of the extreme
     case,  I would like to examine Mr.  de  Jager's  example  of  the
     "private weather bureau".  To briefly restate his arguments,  the
     operators of the weather bureau spend energy (money)  to  collect
     raw  data,  spend  energy (money) to process it into synopses and
     predictions and therefore have the right to sell the  information
     to  whomever can or wants to pay the price.  All this sounds good
     to me.  Even if I don't choose to buy the information  myself,  I
     Fidonews                     Page 4                   11 Aug 1986


     agree  that  my  life has been made richer by the presence of the
     option to buy the information.  That is as far as Mr.  de Jager's
     argument goes and it is just not far enough!  John Donne said "no
     man  is  an  island"  and  in this context let us see what energy
     costs the operators  of  the  "private  weather  bureau"  owe  by
     default  to  society.  Were  they  educated  in the public school
     system?  Did they attend a university funded  in  part  from  the
     public  purse?  Did  they  use government documents and guides in
     developing their collecting and  reporting  standards?  Did  they
     use  government-guaranteed  business  development  loans  to  get
     established?  The list of similar questions  is  almost  endless.
     The  answer of course is that before even the first prediction or
     weather report is issued the operators already owe every  citizen
     something.  How  much?  Well,  not  a  free prediction for Sunday
     afternoon's trip to the  beach,  but  in  the  case  of  a  major
     disaster a warning is due, FREE OF CHARGE.

     None  of  these  arguments  has  anything to do with "makers" and
     "takers",  nor anything to do with depriving people of what  they
     have earned; just an occasional show of humanity.

     Lastly,  information  and computer programs are not comparable in
     this  discussion.   Programs  are  tools;   to  use  them  in  an
     unauthorized way is the same as refusing to pay for the rental of
     a carpet cleaner from your local supermarket after you've used it
     to clean your rugs.  Stealing programs is something most of us do
     simply  because  we  can  get  away with it.  For that you cannot
     provide a moral defense,  but  to  claim  an  absolute  right  to
     withold information is no more defensible.

                              In Rememberence


          I don't know if any of you out there in FREEWARE  land  ever
     go  thru back issues of FidoNews or not.  I do and in issue # 226
     there was a notice about the passing of a very special person.

          Although I never met him, or for that matter,  ever heard of
     him, he affected my life in a way that has really been of immense
     value  to  me.  The person of whom I speak is none other then Mr.
     Andrew Fluegelman.

          If you ,like myself, never heard of him before I suggest you
     stop to think about what life would be like if  you  had  to  BUY
     every one of the FREEWARE, SHAREWARE, etc.  type of programs that
     you now enjoy at little or no cost to you.  I suspect  you  would
     have  a  very limited library of software for your system.  After
     pondering this for a few minutes, stop and think about how all of
     this FREEWARE stuff got started in the first place.

          AHA, I see the little bulbs lighting up now.....

          Mr Fluegelman was indeed the first person to release a major
     piece of software under the FREEWARE concept. To quote the writer
     of the obituary posted in issue 226 of FidoNews,"He  is  probably
     best known as the author of PC-TALK".

          His contribution to the computer world will probably outlast
     all  of  us  and rightly so.  He believed in the addage "The best
     judge of the worth of a piece of software is the USER on his  own
     system".

          As I said before, I have never met him;  and until the other
     night  I never really knew of him.  But after reading that notice
     and looking through my library,  it really hit  home  as  to  the
     impact he had on me.  In his own way he introduced me to software
     I would never have been able to afford otherwise.  He gave me the
     opportunity to try new things without having to own a mint.  He I
     suppose made it possible Tom Jennings to be  gracious  enough  to
     release Fido to the public for public use. HE STARTED A TREND !

          Freeware  has become a MAJOR source of software for millions
     of computer owners with a multitude of  different  machines,  and
     yet most of us (myself included) never make his concept come true
     for  the  authors  out  there who labor over programs for months,
     even years,  simply to give it away on the premise that basically
     humans  are  honest enough to be fair about donating something to
     the author for his troubles.

          As I sit here pounding on  my  keyboard,  I  make  a  mental
     Fidonews                     Page 6                   11 Aug 1986


     promise  to  myself  to PAY for all the FREEWARE and other freely
     distributed software that I use and whenever  I  find  the  extra
     cash I do indeed make every effort to send a donation of at least
     the  WORTH  of  the program to the author.  I value freeware as a
     concept and will continue to support it in every way  I  possibly
     can.

     AND I REMEMBER.........                Thank you, Mr. Fluegelman.

            NEW FIDO_BBS from COMPUTERTOWN UK! - LOG-on-the-TYNE

     Hi,  My name is JOHN BONE,  and I have been using BBS since 1980,
     here in the United Kingdom of GREAT BRITAIN,  I now (FOOL!)  have
     set up the FIRST FIDO_BBS, in the north-east coast of England.

     ComputerTown  UK!,  is alive and kicking,  based to a small exent
     upon  the  CTUSA!,   newsletters   of   yester-year!   My   group
     ComputerTown  North  east  covers  the  TYNESIDE conurbanation of
     NEWCASTLE upon TYNE , and GATESHEAD.

     We have several needs....  international contacts,  and help with
     some  of your FIDO users micros....  any ST freaks out there?  we
     would like any info on PUBLIC  DOMAIN  software,  and  hints/help
     etc...

     We  also  have  several TANDY (TRS-80 model I/II/III IV(P) users)
     who would like to swop FIDO NET MAIL and puiblic domain software,
     hints etc.

     Mark Welch, 161/459 <private>

                  An IBM-PC Compatibility Testing Program


     NOTICE:  A programming project  is  being  started  on  the  BYTE
     Information Exchange (BIX), to write an IBM-PC-compatibility test
     program.  The  activity  is  centered in the software engineering
     (soft.eng) conference on BIX,  but input and assistance from  all
     computer users is desired.

     The following are the opening messages in the conference.  If you
     have any suggestions or comments,  please send them to me at Fido
     161/459, or via BIX.

                             -- Mark Welch

     TITLE: A Compatibility Testing Program: Overview

     I wrote a long essay about compatibility, but who needs it? To
     sum up: none of the available IBM-compatible computers run
     every software title. Before buying a computer, most folks
     would like to be forwarned of what incompatibilities that
     machine might have when compared to the IBM PC.

     The goal, then, is to write a program that tests a machine for
     each of the "known" incompatibilities, and warns the potential
     buyer.


     ==========
     soft.eng/compat #5, from mwelch, Sat Jul 12 23:28:34 1986
     ----------
     TITLE: A Compatibility Testing Program: Rough design:

     All output of compatibility test results should be sent to the
     screen, to a file, and to a printer (if selected). Status
     should always be stored to disk before any action that could
     potentially crash the computer, so the program, when re-
     started after re-boot, will be able to figure out where it
     left off, note the meaning of the crash if possible, and then
     continue testing. A particularly incompatible machine may
     crash a dozen or more times during testing, but the persistent
     user deserves a complete report.

     The testing should have several levels: one that doesn't
     require activity by the user; one that requires keyboard
     activity only by the user; and one which requires the user to
     open the machine and play with DIP switches and reboot the
     machine several times. (Rebooting may be required in any
     level, if an impolite incompatibility is found.)

     1) Test to see if this is an IBM PC. Look for the IBM
        copyright in the ROM (are there other ways? compare certain
        byte locations?). If it is an IBM PC ROM, say so, and then
        continue the tests anyway.

     2) Measure the system's speed. If it's not 4.77 MHz, warn the
        user about programs (list, please?) that are time-
        dependent. Let him/her know that this problem applies to
        the AT and PCjr as well. Test RAM speed, CPU speed, overall
        speed, and if possible (how?) bus speed.

     3) (a) Write characters to the screen using DOS, and then do a
        direct screen read. Report if you can't find the screen in
        the usual locations. (b) Write characters directly to the
        screen, and ask the user if it says what it's supposed to.
        (c) Do whatever it is that generates "snow" on some
        machines but not others, and ask the user if he sees snow.
        If so, it's probably more IBM-compatible, but if not, it's
        better. (d) What other tests for direct-screen-access
        compatibility might there be?

     4) (a) Systematically test each documented BIOS function call,
        using the "accepted" entry points. Report results of each.
        (b) Do the same for undocumented function calls and any
        known entry points used by ill-behaved programs.

     5) Hardware: (a) disk drive compatibility (for copy-protected
        programs using bizarre techniques. How can you test this?)
        (What do programs do to floppy controllers that might bring
        out incompatibilities?) Also check speed and compare to IBM
        PC.  (b) Hard disk compatibility. Also report speed (report
        it, if present, and compare it to the IBM spec of 85 ms).
        (c) Serial port: if present, check if it's in the right
        location. Check if there's an 8259 there. (other test for
        serial port compatibility?)  (c) Ditto for parallel port:
        how do you test it?  (d) Keyboard: Ask the user to type
        certain keys, and see what scan codes you get. Figure out
        which keyboard it is, if known, and report any possible
        problems.

     6) Kludge time. Now begin executing individual tests. This is
        where we tag on new tests.

     TITLE: Implementation Options

     Given the large number of excellent programmers on BIX, with
     experience in almost every tongue, it could be argued forever.
     My proposal is that the compatibility-test program be written
     in Turbo Pascal, because that seems to be the most commonly-
     owned compiler on BIX (and because I have more experience with
     it than any other compiler). I'm sure that many of the tests
     will need to be coded in assembler; is CHASM (the CHeap
     ASseMbler, shareware and already on BIX) acceptable?
        Any comments? Suggestions?

                              Computerfest '86


         Computerfest '86 is designed to be a gathering of local  area
     user  groups  and vendors in the Washington D.C.  area,  an event
     where everyone can benefit from attending,  from the  person  who
     knows very little about micros to the hard-core "Give me assembly
     or give me death" hacking types.

         It  will be on Saturday,  October 25,  1986,  from 9:30 AM to
     5:00 PM at  the  Adele  H.  Stamp  Union  at  the  University  of
     Maryland, College Park.

         There will be representatives from the various user groups in
     the  area,  including  the  Capitol  PC User Group and Washington
     Apple Pi (we're still talking to the Atari & Commodore  folks  as
     of this date <7/22/86>). They'll have public domain software, and
     people to answer questions.

         Seminars:  We  currently  are  in  the  process  of arranging
     seminars on  the  following  topics:  Small  Business  Computing,
     BBSing,  Desktop  publishing,  Computers and the Disabled,  MIDI,
     (and lots more if I can dig up the speakers).

         Apple Computer,  Inc.  has stated it will send out a  speaker
     for our event.  We also are working on getting someone from Atari
     and we're talking to Bruce Webster to see  if  he  can  come  and
     speak  (Bruce  is  the  author  of  "Sundog"  and has a column in
     "Byte").  By the time you read this,  I'm hoping  we  can  get  a
     handle on someone else of note.

         In  addition,  we'll  have  a  number  of  local area vendors
     displaying their equipment and peripherials in the Grand Ballroom
     of the Student Union,  for the whole range of personal  computers
     currently available today,  PLUS a "Swapfest" where users can get
     rid of their surplus hardware and legally acquired software.

         Why should you come?  Basically,  this event is designed  for
     you  to  have fun and learn more about computers.  It is a single
     day event,  so I'd feel kinda guilty if you came all the way from
     New York or Florida just to say "hi". However, if you live within
     an  hour or two of College Park,  Maryland (this means Baltimore,
     large parts of Maryland,  Northern Virginia),  it should be worth
     your time.

         Admission  is $6.00/general and $4.00/discount.  Print a copy
     of this from your printer and you qualify for a  discount.  Xerox
     it,  give  it  to  your  friend  Fred,  and  he  can get in for a
     discount.  Very easy to get a discount.

     Karl Andrews, 138/24

                           What is a Julian Date?


     The numeric extension on the NODEDIFF files is probably the  most
     common example of a Julian Date, at least for Fido Sysops.  It is
     the  number  of days since the beginning of the current year.  So
     why is it called a Julian Date?  Here is the story...

     Calendars evolved from  the  observation  that  approximately  12
     cycles  of  the  moon corresponded with one cycle of the seasons.
     The key word is approximately -- there are about 12.368267  lunar
     months in a solar year of 365.242199 days, for an excess of about
     97  days  every  400  years.  Since  civil calendars must have an
     exact number of days each year (imagine the confusion if 1987 was
     to start at  09:24.7  rather  than  00:00),  various  schemes  of
     inserting  extra  days  or  months  were  used  to keep the dates
     synchronized with the seasons,  although  some  societies  didn't
     seem  to  care.  For  instance,  the  ancient  Egyptians  let the
     seasons cycle through their calendar,  so the date of the  annual
     flooding  of  the  Nile (caused by melting snow in the mountains)
     gradually shifted until after 1460 years it had  gone  completely
     through  the  year.  In  22  BC,  Augustus forced them to adopt a
     variant of the new Julian Calendar, but the two calendars existed
     side by side for another 250 years.

     The Roman calendar was originally a lunar calendar,  with  rather
     arbitrary  insertions  of  extra  days.  These  adjustments  were
     frequently neglected,  with the  result  that  by  46  BC,  their
     calendar  was  about  two  months  out  of sync with the seasons.
     Julius Caesar established a new calendar,  with a year of  365.25
     days  by adding a leap day every fourth year,  to become official
     in 45 BC.  He also added extra days to resynchronize the seasons,
     making 46 BC some 445 days long.  Because of civil disorders  and
     communication  problems,  the  leap  year  adjustments  were made
     incorrectly for a while,  and Augustus readjusted the calendar in
     the period 8 BC to 8 AD, but the Julian Calendar survived without
     further change for almost 1600 years.

     Unfortunately,  the  mean  Julian  Calendar  Year  (365.25  days)
     exceeded the length of the tropical  year  (365.242199  days)  by
     about 11 minutes, 14 seconds.  The continued accumulation of this
     excess  adds  up  to  about 3 days every 400 years,  and causes a
     gradual slippage of the  seasons.  By  the  middle  of  the  16th
     century,  this  had produced a very noticeable effect on the date
     of Easter,  which is based on an actual astronomical observation,
     so  in  1582 Pope Gregory modified the calendar by NOT adding the
     leap day on century years not divisible by  400,  such  as  1800,
     1900, and 2100, making the length of the mean year 365.2425 days.
     He  also  dropped 10 days out of October (the day after 4 October
     was 15 October) to resynchronize Easter,  but these changes  were
     not  immediately adopted in non-Catholic countries -- England and
     the colonies adopted the new calendar in 1752, Japan in 1873, and
     Turkey in 1927.

     Fidonews                     Page 16                  11 Aug 1986


     The error in the Gregorian Calendar amounts to about one  day  in
     3300  years,  and is about the same magnitude as the variation in
     the rotation rate of the Earth.  This,  plus the fact that we now
     adjust  the  length  of  the year by using leap seconds (the last
     minute of June and/or December has either 61 or  59  seconds,  as
     needed),  means  that there is no astronomical reason to make any
     further changes in the calendar.

     The current system of counting the years from the birth of  Jesus
     was  established in 525 by Dionysius Exiquus,  but the records he
     had access to were not complete,  and he missed the correct  date
     by  about  5  years  (there  is  even  now a 1 year uncertainty).
     Unfortunately, this creates a problem in dating events before the
     Christian Era in that not only do the years BC  have  a  negative
     sign,  but  there  is no Year Zero.  The math for date arithmetic
     gets rather complicated,  and there was always  the  question  of
     which  calendar  to  use  to  date  any given event;  and we have
     already seen how flaky some of those calendars were.  This is why
     astronomers and other scientists who need accurate ancient  dates
     use Julian Days.

     The  Julian Day system was introduced in 1583 by Joseph Scaliger,
     a French/Dutch historian who was an expert on calendars, and is a
     continuous count of the days since noon (GMT) on 1  January  4713
     BC.  He  picked  this  date because it was when the 28-year solar
     cycle, the 19-year lunar cycle,  and an ancient civil cycle of 15
     years  all coincided (this will not happen again for another 1281
     years).  This had the advantage of  perfectly  unambiguous  dates
     and no negative numbers;  for instance, 1 June 1986 is Julian Day
     2,446,582 and 1 June 584 BC is JD 1,507,900.  The  irony  of  the
     whole  thing  is  that Julian Days have nothing at all to do with
     the Julian Calendar;  Scaliger named his system after his father,
     Julius Scaligeri.

     Calling  the  annual  day  count  a  Julian  Date is not strictly
     correct,  but is typical of what happens to technical terms  that
     pass  into  the  vernacular.  After  all,  look  at  the  current
     practice of using baud to mean bits per  second  --  a  1200  bps
     modem  is actually running at 600 baud,  but is using each change
     of the signal level to pass two bits of data,  something that was
     not imagined when the term "baud" was coined.

             NEWFILES - A New FIDO Outside Utility for Sysop's

     NEWFILES is a program designed to run "outside"  of  Fido,  using
     Don Daniels' (Fido 107/211) Outside utility.  NEWFILES allows the
     individual Fido user to enter a period in days,  with the program
     listing  any  new  files  posted to the board during that period.
     The user will only see files present in areas  which  he/she  has
     the  proper  privilege  level  to  access.  The  program displays
     information straight from the FILES.BBS file  in  the  particular
     area.

     Example:

     A user has access to area 1 only,  called MISC.  The DIR.BBS file
     contains "Misc. Files".  The FILES.BBS file contains:

         EXAMPLE.ARC 06-02-86 An example file
         LK100.ARC 06-31-86 Data Encryption Utility

     The files in area 1 are:

         example.arc  19400 bytes 6-2-86
         lk100.arc  38512 bytes 6-30-86

     If today's date is 7-25-86, and the user enters 60 days, NEWFILES
     will generate the following listing on the users screen:

         Misc. Files

         EXAMPLE.ARC  19400   06-02-86 An example file
         LK100.ARC    38512   06-30-86 Data Encryption Utility

     The users privilege level is read from LASTUSER.BBS.  Sysops  may
     use  the  program  by  running  it  locally using the "S" (Sysop)
     command switch,  to avoid having to log on to  the  system.  This
     will  allow  access  to  all areas.  The sysop may also specify a
     number of days to allow in the listing, like this:

         NEWFILES S 20

     This will display all files in all areas entered within the  last
     20 days.

     NEWFILES,  and  it's  C  source  code,  along  with  Outside  and
     SPLTNEWS,  the FidoNews Splitter,  are available from  Nibbles  &
     Bytes Fido 158/104, (919) 942-9267.

                      One Man's Opinion of PC-WRITE

         by John J. Herro, 1456 Miner Circle, Endicott, NY  13760


     The author is a Senior Software Engineer for the General Electric
     Company.  He has no connection with Quicksoft,  Inc.,  except for
     being  a  registered user of PC-WRITE.  Since he knows of no Fido
     nodes near him, he is probably best reached by the U.  S.  Snail,
     otherwise known as the U. S. Mule or the Phony Express.


     PC-WRITE  is an excellent word processor / text editor written by
     Quicksoft,  Inc.,  and marketed under  the  "Shareware"  concept.
     This  means  that  you  can download the latest version from your
     favorite bulletin board  and  try  PC-WRITE  for  free.  You  can
     optionally  "register"  with Quicksoft for a reasonable fee,  but
     even if you choose not to register,  you are still encouraged  to
     distribute  copies of the program.  This is such a welcome relief
     from copy-protected word processors that sell for several hundred
     dollars!

     PC-WRITE runs on any size PC, including a PC Junior.  The program
     includes a brief tutorial manual and  a  quick  reference  guide,
     both  of which can be printed out.  Thus,  when you copy PC-WRITE
     you are also making copies of the two manuals,  without the  need
     of an office copying machine!

     Quicksoft  provides  several incentives for you to register.  One
     is telephone support. (More about that later.) Users who register
     also receive a more detailed printed manual (which would not  fit
     on   the  PC-WRITE  diskette),   a  one-year  subscription  to  a
     newsletter,  and two free updates (or one update and  the  source
     code).  Finally,  when  you register,  Quicksoft assigns a unique
     number for you to embed into the program  before  you  give  away
     copies.  If  anyone registers from one of your copies,  Quicksoft
     will send you a modest sum, hence the name "Shareware."

     PC-WRITE contains two major programs, ED to edit a file and PR to
     print it.  You simply type ED <filename> or  PR  <filename>;  the
     on-line help is excellent.  When you first get PC-WRITE,  you run
     a special program to customize it for your particular printer.  A
     large menu of printer manufacturers is  presented;  when  one  is
     selected,  a  menu  of  printer  models made by that manufacturer
     appears.  Subscripts, superscripts,  boldfacing,  underlining,  a
     variety  of fonts,  etc.,  are then all available if your printer
     supports them.

     If your printer is not  on  the  menu,  PC-WRITE  can  treat  the
     printer  as "dumb" (having no special features).  Underlining and
     bold-facing  are  still  available  if  your  printer  recognizes
     backspaces.   Alternately,  Quicksoft  will  help  you  customize
     PC-WRITE.

     I've  found  the  telephone support to be excellent,  and I never
     received a busy signal.  Even before I registered,  Quicksoft was
     Fidonews                     Page 19                  11 Aug 1986


     nice  enough  to help me with a printer problem.  I have a Smith-
     Corona Deville 3 Messenger typewriter with  a  parallel  computer
     interface; it isn't on the PC-WRITE menu.  It amounts to a daisy-
     wheel  printer  with  a very small buffer.  The DOS PRINT command
     was working correctly, but when I ran PR, I would get the message
     "Printer not ready, Abort,  Retry,  or Ignore?" Responding with R
     caused  errors  on  the printed page.  My MS-DOS manual explained
     how to do "infinite retry" with a SERIAL interface,  but not with
     a  PARALLEL  interface.  Since  my version of MS-DOS came with 90
     days of telephone support,  and the 90 days had  not  expired,  I
     first called the MS-DOS support telephone number.  When they were
     not able to help,  I called Quicksoft.  When Quicksoft asked if I
     had registered, I said, "No.  I'm willing to register, but I want
     be certain that PC-WRITE will work with my printer  first."  They
     were very courteous about giving me help,  and advised me to type
     MODE LPT1:,,P.  That fixed the problem,  and of  course  I  added
     that  command  to  my  AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  Quicksoft also told me
     that if I had registered first and later became  dissatisfied,  I
     would have no trouble getting my money back.

     ED,  the screen editor, has a few features not found even on some
     expensive word processors.  For example,  you can optionally make
     the  program  continuously  keep  a paragraph within the margins,
     even while adding words to the middle of the  paragraph!  I  find
     this feature very useful.  Also,  PC-WRITE works with ASCII files
     - a MUST for programmers.  I've even edited .EXE  files,  because
     there's  no  limit to the line length.  (The screen automatically
     scrolls horizontally when long lines are edited.) There are a few
     "font  characters,"  for  example,  alternate-B  for  Boldfacing.
     These  characters  can  optionally  be made visible or invisible.
     When they are invisible, boldfacing appears on the screen as high
     intensity, etc.

     PR interprets the special characters for your particular printer,
     and also optionally pauses at the end of each page,  in case  you
     don't  have  continuous  paper.  It  also  has a nice feature for
     recovering from a paper jam in a  long  document.  If  the  paper
     jams,  you  can  interrupt PR and resume printing from the top of
     the current page or any other page.

     Other features include definable keys, mail-merge,  footnotes and
     headers, table of contents and index, automatic page breaks, file
     includes,  keyboard  input  during printing,  etc.  The method of
     writing to the screen can be changed  to  avoid  "snow"  on  some
     systems,  and  the  screen  can  be  divided  into two windows of
     unequal size.  Text can be "cut" from one file and "pasted"  into
     another.

     Much  thought  has  been  given  to  assigning functions to keys,
     although the assignments can be changed if  desired.  To  COPY  a
     block of text, you use F3 three times: at the start of the block,
     at the end of the block,  and at the new location.  Similarly, to
     MOVE a block of text,  you use F6 three times,  and to  DELETE  a
     block,  you  use  F4  twice.  (You  can  undelete  the block with
     control-F4.) For the masochists among you,  most of  the  control
     codes of Wordstar (tm of MicroPro) are duplicated.  Control-D can
     Fidonews                     Page 20                  11 Aug 1986


     be  used  instead  of  the  ->  key  to move the cursor right one
     character, control-F will move right one word, etc.

     PC-WRITE lacks two features that are found on some expensive word
     processors.  At present,  ED cannot handle files that are too big
     to fit in memory, and there is no spelling checker.  Rumor has it
     that both of these  deficiencies  will  be  removed  in  a  later
     version.  In  the  meantime,  PC-WRITE  will  at  least  help you
     segment large files,  and  spelling  checkers  like  EZSPELL  and
     PC-SPELL can be found on many bulletin boards.

     PC-WRITE.ARC  is  available  on the IFNA board,  314-576-2743.  I
     hope that PC-WRITE will become the de facto standard for PCs  and
     compatibles,  and that the "Shareware" concept will put an end to
     copy protection forever!

                 New Utility Reports Questionnaire Results


     A useful feature of FIDO is its online questionnaire.  It  allows
     the  sysop  to  survey  the  users of his system for a variety of
     purposes,  such as to find  out  the  demographics  of  the  user
     population, or to do surveys of popular opinion.

     However, until now, there was no easy way to find out the results
     of  such  surveys.  You could print out the answer files in their
     raw format,  but they  just  show  answers  by  question  number,
     without  giving  the  question  text;  you  have  to  look in the
     question file to see what question is being answered.

     Also,  there is no way to see at a glance how the  answers  to  a
     given question break down;  the answers are shown grouped by user
     without any tabulation.

     A utility I have written,  and am  distributing  as  "shareware",
     will  solve  this problem.  QUESREPT (QUEStionnaire REPorT) takes
     the FIDO question and answer files and automatically generates  a
     report of the results.  Multiple choice answers are tabulated and
     the  number  and  percentage for each choice is given.  Free-text
     answers are listed with all answers to a given question together.
     The text of your question is given immediately above  the  report
     of its answers.

     QUESREPT   can  get  its  input  from  the  standard  FIDO  files
     QUESTION.BBS and ANSWERS.BBS,  or  any  other  questionnaire  and
     answer files in standard format which you may define.  The output
     can go to the printer,  the console, or any other file or device;
     the page  length  to  format  the  report  may  be  redefined  to
     customize  it for your system.  All such parameters may be placed
     in a control file  so  that  QUESREPT  can  run  unattended  (for
     example, as a regular weekly event) with no user input required.

     QUESREPT can be downloaded from SOFT FIDO at (318) 636-4402.  (It
     can  be  found in a file QUESREPT.ARC in file area 6.) Direct all
     questions to Daniel Tobias on FIDO 19/216.

     Todd C. Looney, 143/27

                      VIETNAM VETERANS BULLETIN BOARD


          In political terms,  the "war" in Vietnam divided the United
     States  in a manner unseen since the time of the Civil War.  Like
     that war, the wounds of divisiveness have been slow to heal,  and
     in fact still very much a part of our society.

          Since the founding of our great Republic,  the traditions of
     American military  history  has  been  one  of  citizen  soldiers
     answering  the  call  to  arms when needed.  Even with a standing
     military force,  this continued to be necessary at  the  time  of
     Vietnam  and  hopefully  will always be so.  It was not our fault
     that this,  of all wars,  was given so much "visual" publicity in
     America  resulting  in it's being the first military action to be
     so overwhelmingly unpopular in the eyes  of  our  peers.  We,  as
     patriotic Americans, did what we thought was best for our country
     and  fellow Americans by sacrificing our own personal freedom for
     a few years so that others might hold  on  to  theirs  throughout
     their lives.  I don't think very many of us wanted, or expected a
     "hero's welcome" when we returned home from that other world, but
     we  sure  didn't  expect  the  treatment  we  got  either - to be
     ostracized and degraded by those very people we had just finished
     risking our lives for in the steamy jungles of Southeast Asia.

          But, as is usually the case, time heals all wounds,  and our
     time for recognition is finally coming about.  Slowly but surely,
     our  peers,  the American Citizen,  is coming to realize that the
     vast majority of Vietnam Veterans had nothing to do with how  the
     war in Vietnam was waged,  that we were but pawns of a a group of
     confused politicians and bureaucrats.  America  is  realizing  at
     long  last  that  we did not deserve the unfair treatment most of
     received when we came home, and most Vietnam Veterans are finally
     beginning  to  feel  proud  of  what they did for this country as
     opposed to the shame they endured for so many years.

          And now our time has come for a bulletin board of  our  very
     own, a bulletin board dedicated the the American Vietnam Veteran!
     It  is  a  place  where  we  can  express  our feelings in a non-
     threatening forum atmosphere as well  as  solicit  the  views  of
     those  Americans  who  played  no active military role during the
     Vietnam "War".  It is a place where we can  meet  each  other  on
     common turf to openly discuss our lives,  both the ups and downs,
     achievements and failures, happiness and pain.

          All those who wish to participate in our forum  are  welcome
     to call;  this is not a restricted BBS.  We invite anyone who was
     affected by the political upheaval  present  during  the  Vietnam
     era.  We  have  had  some very intelligent contributions from not
     only those who served in the armed forces  during  the  War,  but
     from  ex-protesters,   students,   draft-dodgers,  and  even  ex-
     Vietnamese citizens,  some of whom had served as Viet Cong  prior
     to their surrender to U.S. military forces.

          Other  related  forums  on  the  LooneyBin include a section
     devoted to the Wives, Lovers, and Friends of Vietnam Veterans,  a
     Soapbox Forum,  and a Genealogy Forum called the ROOT CELLAR.  We
     also have plenty of public domain software available.

          We feel that the gap we fill in today's society  by  hosting
     such  a forum as this is an extremely important and valuable one.
     We solicit any sysops from other areas of the country  to  follow
     our lead,  and join us if they will by forming a Vietnam Veterans
     Conference Network of FIDO BBS's.  We solicit any  sysop  who  is

     a suggestion or twelve to contact us at:

                       SUBSCRIPTS, WORDSTAR AND EPSON

                               by Tom Ingram

     The purpose of this article is to explain how I was able  to  get
     WordStar  to print technical manuscripts on my Epson printer with
     TRUE  subscripts  and  superscripts  (not  the  compressed  Epson
     characters  on  the same line with the rest of the text).  I find
     the  Epson  subscripts  and  superscripts  difficult   to   read,
     especially after reproduction of the text.

     First,  I  patched  WordStar using the WINSTALL program.  At ^R I
     patched the following code:  03 1B 41 06.  The 03 tells  WordStar
     how  many bytes of code are coming.  The 1B is the ASCII code for
     escape,  the 41 is ASCII for "A".  ESC A 6 causes  the  Epson  to
     space  down  only  a  half  line each time it is sent a linefeed.
     Once this patch is in place, I set up a document as follows:

     1) On the first line of the document  I  issue  the  dot  command
        PL132.  This  sets  up  normal length pages for the ^R command
        which is issued next.

     2) Issue the ^R command on the next line of the document.

     3) Now,  issue the command ^O S 4.  This sets the line spacing to
        4  so that the document will appear double spaced.  For single
        spaced documents (with crowded  subscripts  and  superscripts)
        use ^O S 2 or ^O S 3 instead.

     Now,  in typing a document, use the subscript and superscript, ^V
     and ^T, indicators as required by WordStar.  The printed document
     will have true half-line roll subscripts and superscripts.

     That is all there is to it.  It is quick and easy and it works.

     One final comment:  this does not  allow  double  subscripts  and
     superscripts.  For example,  so far as I know,  it will not print
     out subscripted subscripts by issuing any  sequence  of  commands
     from the keyboard.

     I  wrote  this  before  my  latest  issue of "Portable Companion"
     arrived.  One statement concerning patching of WordStar 3.30 from
     the WINSTALL program allowed me to obtain a  second  solution  to
     the   problem  I  have  been  discussing.   This  method  is  not
     necessarily better  than  the  one  I  described  above.  On  the
     surface  it  appears  to be better but it has the disadvantage of
     being somewhat slower in printing regular documents which do  not
     need  subscripting  or  superscripting.   I  now  have  one  disk
     containing  WordStar  configured  as  below  for  subscripts  and
     superscripts and one configured as above for regular files.  This
     way  I  do  not  have  to  reformat  all my old files for the new
     procedure.  Here is the second method:
     Fidonews                     Page 25                  11 Aug 1986


     While in the WINSTALL program provided with WordStar  3.30,  when
     you  get  to  the point where you can type X to exit to CP/M,  an
     undocumented command available is to type +.  At this  point  you
     can  patch  WordStar  by  entering the label at which you wish to
     make a patch.  The program is well prompted here and I  was  able
     to  patch in the following changes which I obtained nearly a year
     ago from MicroPro:

         1) PSCRLF  03 0D 0A 0A                NORMAL LINEFEED
         2) PSHALF  02 0D 0A                   HALF LINEDOWN
         3) PSINIT  06 1B 40 1B 41 06 0D       PRINTER RESET
         4) PSFINI  02 1B 40                   EOP RESET

     I made the patches listed above and they work to produce properly
     printed documents with subscripts and  superscripts.  The  reason
     printing  is  somewhat slower is that each page requires twice as
     many linefeeds to print the page.  Of  course  the  other  method
     works  the  same  way,  but  it  has  the  advantage that regular
     documents will print with 66 linefeeds per page.

     For a continuous underling at ^PS and something like an alternate
     pitch the following patches could be used:

         5) PALT    03 1B 46 0F                 CONDENSED SET ON
         6) PSTD    01 12                       CONDENS. SET OFF
         7) RIBBON  03 1B 2D 01                 UNDERLINE ON
         8) RIBOFF  03 1B 2D 00                 UNDERLINE OFF

     55 DS/DD diskettes!!

     This collection is the result of more than 15 months of intensive
     downloads  from  just  about 150 or more BBS's and other sources,
     all of which have been examined,  indexed and archived  for  your
     convenience.  Starting  a  Bulletin Board System?  Want to add on
     to your software base without spending thousands of dollars? This
     is the answer!!!

     To order the library,  send  $100  (personal  or  company  check,
     postal money order or company purchase order) to:

                    Micro Consulting Associates, Fido 103/511
                    Post Office Box 4296
                    200-1/2 E. Balboa Boulevard
                    Balboa, Ca. 92661-4296

     Please allow 3 weeks for delivery of your order.

     Note:  No  profit  is  made  from  the  sale of the Public Domain
     software in this collection.  The price is  applied  entirely  to
     the  cost  of  downloading  the  software  over  the phone lines,
     running a  BBS  to  receive  file  submissions,  and  inspecting,
     cataloguing, archiving and maintaining the files.  Obtaining this
     software yourself through the use of  a  computer  with  a  modem
     using  commercial phone access would cost you much more than what
     we charge for the service...

     Please specify what type of format you would like the disks to be
     prepared on.  The following choices are available:
           - IBM PC-DOS Backup utility
           - Zenith MS-DOS 2.11 Backup Utility
           - DSBackup
           - Fastback
           - ACS INTRCPT 720k format
           - Plain  ol' files (add $50)

     Add $30 if you want  the  library  on  1.2  meg  AT  disks  (more
     expensive  disks).  There  are  no  shipping or handling charges.
     California residents add 6% tax.

     For each sale, $10 will go to the FidoNet Administrators.
