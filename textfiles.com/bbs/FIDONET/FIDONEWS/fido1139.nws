ZCC selects new FidoNet International Coordinator
FidoNet IC Elected to Office
From: The Zone Coordinator Council (ZCC)
Submitted by: Colin Wheat, Z3C (3:3/0)

The Zone Coordinator Council (ZCC) has, by a majority and unanimous
vote of 6:0, selected George Peace as the new FidoNet International
Coordinator, with effect from the 1st September 1994. George was the
immediate past Zone 1 Coordinator. POLICY4 wording requires that the
IC be selected from amongst the ZC ranks, however this solution has
been made possible by a POLICY interpretation supplied by the
outgoing IC.

The ZCC wishes to thank the outgoing IC, Matt Whelan, for his past
contributions to the FidoNet network. The responsibility and required
time commitment of the IC position are substancial and demanding,
thanks for the commendable contribution Matt.

There has been an unfortunate time delay between IC resignation and
this selection. However with George accepting the position, we're
looking  forward to improving levels of Zonal cooperation and
performance both within the ZCC and throughout the Network.

Garcia (Z4C), Henk Wolsink (Z5C), and Honlin Lue (Z6C).

Dear Reverend Visage,

How fortuitous that you sojourned in Winnipeg which is several
hundred kilometres south of my birthplace. Had I known that you
were there, I would have sent my entire extended family to visit
you. They would have enjoyed the respite from sitting around the
curling rink, chewing moosehide. Although, in deference to their
advancing years, they no longer chew the hide while it is on the
moose.

Settling your various accounts has become a matter of some
sensitivity with the Snooze editors. They have begun to doubt the
monetary value of several hundred tons of autographed copies of
FidoNews 11-39                 Page:  3                    26 Sep 1994

the book: "My Short Life in Politics, by Mark Skaff." I fear that
we will have to supply them with several volumes, all signed in
jello, of Bill Clinton's "Conquering Unarmed Third World
Countries for Peace, Prosperity & Primary Votes."

The appearance of our comatose but still twitching RC was
indeed a pleasant surprise. The patterning sessions are
going remarkably well and he has begun to explain in short,
partial confessions, how it is possible for someone with
more than one working neuron to be able to foul up the
nodelist submission week after week. His ass/elbow
coordination powers have not yet advanced to the stage where
he is capable of distributing the snooze but I shall burn
prayer incense at the First Church of Appliantology & Dayglo
Black Velvet Paintings for his speedy recovery.

I also fear that the ZC, Bob Satti (cue the heavenly choir
of angels) has disappeared. He seems incapable of answering
the simplest of netmail queries as to why he has left our
region in the flippers of such a clearly incompetent
nodelist clerk. Perhaps Satti, (cue the large bolts of
lightning) recognizes in Rick a sort of kindred spirit since
he was singularly incapable of curtailing the hydrophobic
GMD weenies in his own net. I suggest you send a covey of
wide ankled Gimli princesses to attend to Satti's emergence
from narcosis.

Speaking of culturally magic moments. I ventured to the
Internationally Plowing match in Pembroke and witnessed the
crowning of an apparition which they named "Queen of The
Furrow." The possible duties of a queen of the furrow haunt
me in my sleep, as you can well imagine. I shall eliminate
the Glenfiditch IV drip in hopes that these visions abate.

The daycare centre of our region, Net250, continues to
supply a rich source of amusement. Apparently, in their rush
to Balkanize the net they had bought several largish bird
baths which they point upwards at the stars, hoping to
receive echomail from the lightning-lashed and painfully
close to solvent planetary beings. They remind me of those
cargo cultists who were so amused by Ms. Labamba when we last
visited Borneo. They speak of receiving mail in gigabytes which
would be something of a notable accomplishment if only some of
them could read. Barry Carter, having seen his ambitions to
become Steve Winter's altar boy dashed, has become the conscience
of their net, asking repeatedly why they keep appointing the
ghost of Richard Nixon's moral heritage to positions of authority
in their net.

I must go Visage, your secretary has a malevolent gleam in her
eyes and fistfuls of Tupperware catalog's in her hands. She is
armed and dangerous, Visage and her ill-humour has nothing at all
to do with the fact my bodyguard of trained Yaks are not yet
housebroken.

Mike Fuchs Compromises Echolist Entry Password Security
MIKE FUCHS COMPROMISES ECHOLIST ENTRY PASSWORD SECURITY
By Alan Boritz - 1:2605/102@fidonet.org

     Never thought you would see a headline like that in Fidonews?
I never expected it, either, until a few days ago, when Mike Fuchs
(the Echolist Scribe, 1:1/201 aka 1:266/71), removed my Elist
conference registration without asking.

     The conference was ZEC, and it was no longer listed for zone-1
backbone distribution.  Since it's former moderator, Dan Buda, had
allowed it's Echolist registration to lapse, ZEC was no longer
listed in the FIDONET.NA control file, and therefore unavailable to
many FidoNet systems that use it to control automatic conference
area requests.  Moderators are required to register, and maintain
registration of backbone conferences, or they risk being removed
from distribution.  In fact, you can't even get a conference
distributed through those channels if it ISN'T registered.

     Just as SYSOP was to be removed from backbone distribution, the
last time it's registration dropped out of the Echolist, ZEC was in
the same boat.

     I submitted an entry, a whole month after the Echolist
registration had lapsed, and registered ZEC, as you can see now in
the September, 1994, edition of the Echolist.  As a result of my
registration, ZEC was restored to the FIDONET.NA control file, and
systems would no longer have difficulty requesting the conference.
Problem solved, right?  Wrong.  Eleven days after submitting my
Echolist entry, this came through the ECHOLIST conference:

The following reflects the current entry in The International
EchoList database on 11-Sep-94 8:38:53 pm

Tagname:      ZEC                         Area Key: ZEC
Title:        Zone 1 Echomail Coordinator Echo Conference
Description:  A conference for Fidonet Sysops to discuss Echomail
              related subjects with the Z1EC.  No flaming allowed.
              This is not a debate conference, it's a discussion and
              Q & A conference.  An Administrative conference.  The
              moderator reserves the right to ban individuals from
              the conference due to disruptive behaviour.

 AB>Hey, what's going on here, Mike?  Are you taking it upon

 AB>echolist entry?

The EchoList entry in question purports itself to be a Zone 1
Backbone conference, making it subject to acceptance or rejection of
the Zone 1 EchoMail Coordinator.  The new Zone 1 EchoMail
coordinator (per the Zone 1 Nodelist) at 1:1/200 identified the
entry to be invalid and provided instructions for correcting it.  If
you have a question regarding Backbone conference entries, please
contact the coordinator of that Backbone.

     Did you know that the "zec" accepts or rejects "backbone"
entries?  Apparently no one else knows that, either, except, perhaps
Mike Fuchs.  Adrian Walker's recent description of the "zec's"
duties don't even mention the word "backbone" ONCE.

     We're told in several supporting documents that the Echolist
Scribe is not an "official" part of the FidoNet echomail
distribution system.  Mike Fuchs tells us, in the current moderator
update instructions (ELTECREF.TXT, in archive ELMOD933.LZH), that:

     "2.   ECHOMAIL DISTRIBUTION BACKBONES

     A clarification is needed on the subject of EchoMail
     backbones and backbone conferences.  The EchoList is not
     an official publication of any of the backbones, zones,
     networks or FidoNet.  It is an open, free directory of
     information on ANY EchoMail conference, anywhere.

FidoNews 11-39                 Page:  7                    26 Sep 1994

     "However, a couple of distribution backbones have
     implemented a requirement (which I heartily endorse) that
     any conference they carry must have a Moderator and
     description publicly identified.  The Zone 1 EchoMail
     Coordinator (among others) has decided to use the EchoList
     as a convenient repository for official information on
     backbone conferences.  So the only exception to the
     EchoList's voluntary status is that dictated by the
     distribution backbone you may choose to use.  If you are
     using one of these backbones you must list, at a minimum,
     the Tag name, the Title, and the Moderators name and node
     number.

     "I have no direct involvement in the distribution or
     administration of EchoMail itself.  Any rules governing
     your conference need to be obtained from your network
     and/or distribution backbone."

     Mr. Fuchs also tells us that the Echolist is strictly informal
(from the header of the current Echolist):

     "The EchoList is an informal, international listing of
     EchoMail Conferences as described and submitted by each
     conference's moderator."

     In addition, Mr. Fuchs tells us that the Echolist will allow
multiple entries for conferences with the same tag name:'

     "In addition to the Tag name, the EchoList implements a
     derived Key field for each conference.  You can ignore the
     existence of this internal Key in all but the most unusual
     situations.  It is used to provide a unique, DOS file name
     compatible abbreviation of the Tag, and to allow multiple
     conferences with the same Tag (perhaps in different
     networks) to maintain independent EchoList entries."

     So where did this recent requirement for "acceptance or
rejection" by the "zec" come from?  From Mr. Fuchs' imagination,
apparently.  Perhaps a more accurate description of Mr. Fuchs'
off-the-cuff excuse could be, "'cause I felt like it."  Since the
Echolist allows multiple entries with the same tag name, there was
no technical reason why Adrian Walker could not register his own
entry, rather than plagiarize MY entry.  It's especially
significant, since no one bothered to ASK me, before I could offer
the password to the next moderator of the conference.

     It's really disappointing that what we've come to regard as a
great collective reference work, and an example to other networks of
a clever working tool, is nothing but the play-toy of a spoiled
brat.  There's no need to file policy complaints, or
beg/plead/threaten people to remove or change a conference's
moderator or backbone distribution standard, just find out Mr.
Fuchs' price to compromise a password and snip out an Elist entry.

     Was Mike Fuchs dishonest in his intent?  It sure looks that
FidoNews 11-39                 Page:  8                    26 Sep 1994

way.  Do we need ANOTHER conference registry, beyond manipulation by
control-freaks?  Absolutely.  Will YOUR Echolist entry be snipped
out if you anger the "backbone boys?"  Only the Shadow knows...

What Is StormNet?

   StormNet is an alternative network for use with  FidoNet
compatible software. We pass messages back and forth both in netmail
and in echomail conferences. In StormNet, each node is welcomed and
assisted in many ways by other StormNet members. We have active
echomail areas and a growing file echo selection.  Our echomail
traffic is growing every day, and are now pulling more mail ever than
before. StormNet has a friendlier atmosphere than can be found in
many other networks.

   StormNet has been in existence for over two years, and in that
time, has grown significantly. Our membership has changed from an
inexperienced group of local nodes to a more mature group of people
from all over the United States, Canada, Europe,  and  Asia.
Currently, we have over 250 nodes in StormNet, and are expanding
every week!

 * Why is StormNet here?

   StormNet was started for a few reasons. When we created it, we
wanted to serve teens, adults, and others worldwide with a quality
alternative network that is relatively cheap to pull in. Most of our
high speed transfers take less than a minute. Although we prefer it,
you don't have to poll every day, we are flexible and will allow you
to poll whenever you like.  We want to serve you with the finest
quality echomail and files for you and your users.  We  are
considerably smaller than FidoNet, and therefore do not have the
overflow of mail/files often seen in its conferences.  The average
cost per month for one who pulls StormNet and polls daily is around
$6.00-7.00 within the US.

 * What are the rules like?

   StormNet? Rules? You've got to be kidding me. Well, it's not
like we don't have any rules; all of the rules in our policy
statement basically stem from one basic principle - "Be nice and use
common sense." The policy's specifics were written to outline some
problems which may potentially arise when people aren't nice and
FidoNews 11-39                 Page:  9                    26 Sep 1994

don't use common sense.

   The SNAC (StormNet Advisory Council) helps to ensure the smooth
running of StormNet affairs. StormNet does not discriminate because
of age, sex, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, beliefs,
taste in food, opinion on world politics, or favorite color.  We
welcome anyone who is interested in joining a fun network to try out
StormNet. We also don't allow "bashing", spindling or other forms of
mutilation of groups in our newsletters, or any of our echos
(excluding WAR_ZONE), and other parts of our network.

 * What are the echos like?

   We have a variety of conferences to suit most needs. If you are
a user of StormNet, or a node, you can request an echo if you feel it
would be active. We have echos on many subjects, A to Z (as we say
SN_A  to SN_Z).  We have a talented staff of moderators and
co-moderators, and combined with the efforts of our international
echomail coordinator, keep the network running smoothly.

 * Internet... Yes, Internet!

   StormNet  is  now  registered  in the domain listings as
"storm.net". All StormNet nodes can use our UUCP host to send
messages anywhere on Internet at no additional cost to you.

 * Vanity Internet addresses

  The StormNet International Internet Coordinator has just recently
allowed a "vanity" name that you can apply for once you join
StormNet. This can be just about anything, and saves typing. For
example, "John.Doe@johnsbbs.storm.net" is alot easier to remember
than "John.Doe@f104.n192.usa.storm.net."

 * Support

   StormNet has support sites for different types of software. We
currently have technical support nodes/echos for BinkleyTerm, EzyCom,
Maximus, Proboard, RemoteAccess, Storm Watch Software, and T.A.G..

   New technical support nodes for other software are permitted and
encouraged. When you apply for technical support, you will get a
flag in the nodelist designating you as a support site. You also get
your name added to the list of technical support nodes at the bottom
of the nodelist. And finally, you have the option to add file and
message echos software you support.

 * What we're looking for

   StormNet is looking for nodes who want to pull in high quality
echomail at a relatively cheap price. Ones who think they would like
StormNet to be on their BBSes or computers.

   We also are looking for new zones to create all the time.
StormNet is not just limited to North America, other continents and
FidoNews 11-39                 Page: 10                    26 Sep 1994

countries are already members, but we would like more. We'd like to
expand StormNet worldwide, and we think that everyone would benefit
from this and it would strengthen relations and understanding between

Regarding the re-engineering of net 6:700
By:
Nils Hammar, 2:205/601@fidonet
nils@bod.fdata.se
4341@msg.abc.se

Regarding the "Re-engineering of Net 700", I can say that it seems like
the RC have appointed a NC that isn't supported by the nodes in
the net in question. This isn't a good situation, and from what
I can tell, the RC is a servant, not a master when assigning a
new NC. If the RC is assigning a NC that isn't accepted by the
majority in the network, then the RC has failed and should
either resign as RC or make a new assignment in cooperation with
the nodes in the net in question.

However, there has to be an easier way to solve this than via
FidoNews, which only annoys the readers.

Since this article from "Chris Leung (6:700/703 aka 6:700/0)"
seems to be written by the recently appointed NC, I think that
FidoNews 11-39                 Page: 12                    26 Sep 1994

it is he that has the most problem, and tries to gain power, but
since I can't review all nodes in that net and check their
opinion, I am unable to tell who is right and who is wrong.

What I think is the most important thing with the nodelist isn't
if all nodes are geographically correct, but that the entries
reflects the right phone number connected to right sysop and
node address, so that I wouldn't wake up Aunt Clara several
times at ZMH for that zone during a week or two...

THE NODELIST IS OUR MAP TO THE REALITY - TRY TO KEEP IT UP TO DATE!
(Don't try to change the reality to reflect the nodelist - it
doesn't work...)

New government elected in Sweden 18. September 1994

nils@bod.fdata.se

What about this subject in Fidonews then? What has the election
of a new government in Sweden to do with our hobby? (I hope that
most of us has this as a hobby)

Continue to read, and you will probably get some visions at least!

The special thing with this election was that this was the first
time that internet was used to spread information about the
result of the election during the counting of votes! There was
two methods used, one where all newspapers in Sweden got the
results via email (except one newspaper that got it via fax), and
the other method was that the results could be picked up by
anybody who had a computer running Mosaic connected to the
internet. This service wasn't restricted to sites in Sweden, and
the information is still possible to access (as far as I know).

I was checking the results myself during the election with a
workstation running Mosaic, and it was really interesting to see
how the numbers changed depending on which part of the country I
was examining. It was even possible to see the raw data, and
check exactly how many votes that was given in each district and
sub-district. The results was also presented graphically, both
in a bar-diagram and in a pie-diagram.

Information about the election was available both in Swedish and
in English at the WWW-server.

At the peak the WWW-server received one call per second, which
isn't bad at all! Anybody that want to check some more about
this can start Mosaic on their workstation or PC and open the
URL "http://www.swip.net/val94". Here is also some information
about the swedish governmental system.

FidoNews 11-39                 Page: 13                    26 Sep 1994

This is written with the reservation that this WWW-server still
runs this information.

I am only waiting for the next country to use this kind of
service in their elections!
I think that Denmark isn't going to be the next country, since
they had their election this Wednesday. (21. September 1994.)

Anybody that knows something about any other country using a
similar method could as well write an article here in FidoNews!

Subject: File 1--New indecency rules proposed
for all online services (fwd)

(MODERATORS' NOTE: In CuD 6.76 we ran a post on the Exon Amendment to
S 1822. S.AMDT.2404, sponsored by Senator J. James Exon (D. Neb.),
raised concerns that proposed federal restrictions on "indecency"
could adversely affect computer communications by placing the onus of
liability on the carrier. Contrary to some reports, the EFF does not
approve of the amendment. For those wishing further information, the
full Bill is: S. 1822 (Sponsored by Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D., S.
Car.). Official Title: A BILL TO FOSTER THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE

NATION'S TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE AND PROTECTION OF THE
PUBLIC INTEREST, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES. At last report, the Bill
(with the amendment) has been referred to the Senate Committee on
Commerce (on 26 July). We're not aware of subsequent action taken
since. The following fowarded post clarifies the amendment)).

From--djw@eff.org (Daniel J. Weitzner)

I.  Overview

  During the final hours before the Senate telecommunications
bill (S.1822) was marked-up by the Senate Commerce Committee, a
provision was added which would expand the current FCC regulation on
obscene and indecent audiotext (900 number) services to virtually all
electronic information services, including commercial online service
providers, the Internet, and BBS operators. This proposal, introduced
by Senator Exon, would require all information service providers and
all other electronic communication service providers, to take steps to
assure that minors do not have access to obscene or indecent material
through the services offered by the service provider.

  Placing the onus, and criminal liability, on the carrier, as
opposed to the originator of the content, threatens to limit the free
flow of all kinds of information in the online world. If carriers are
operating under the threat of criminal liability for all of the
content on their services, they will be forced to pre-screen all
messages and limit both the privacy and free expression of the users
of these services. Senator Exon's amendment raises fundamental
questions about the locus on liability for harm done from content in
new digital communications media. These questions must be discussed
in a way that assures the free flow of information and holds content
originators responsible for their actions.

II.  Summary of Exon Amendment

  The Exon amendment which is now part of S.1822, expands section
of the Communications Act to cover anyone who "makes, transmits, or
otherwise makes available" obscene or indecent communication. It
makes no distinction between those entities which transmit the
communications from those which create, process, or use the
communication. This section of the Communications Act was originally
intended to criminalize harassment accomplished over interstate
telephone lines, and to require telephone companies that offer
indecent 900 number services to prevent minors from having access to
such services. The 900 number portions are known as the Helms
Amendments, having been championed by Senator Jesse Helms. These
sections have been the subject of extension constitutional litigation.

  If enacted into law, these amendments would require that anyone
who "makes, transmits, or otherwise makes available" indecent
communication take prescribed steps to assure that minors are
FidoNews 11-39                 Page: 15                    26 Sep 1994

prevented from having access to these communications. In the case of
900 numbers, acceptable procedures include written verification of a
subscriber's age, payment by credit card, or use of a scrambling
device given to the subscriber after having verified his or her age.
Failure to do so would result in up to a $100,000 fine or up to two
years imprisonment.

III. Carrier Liability and Threats to the Free Flow of Information

  These provisions raise serious First Amendment concerns. (Note
that we use the term 'carrier' here to refer to a wide range of
information and communication service providers. This does not
suggest that these entities are, or should be, common carriers in the
traditional sense of the term.)

  Overbroad carrier liability forces carriers to stifle the free
flow of information on their systems and to act as private censors

  If carriers are responsible for the content of all information
and communication on their systems, then they will be forced to
attempt to screen all content before it is allowed to enter the
system. In many cases, this would be simply impossible. But even
where it is possible, such pre-screening can severely limit the
diversity and free flow of information in the online world. To be
sure, some system operators will want to offer services that
pre-screen content. However, if all systems were forced to do so, the
usefulness of digital media as communication and information
dissemination systems would be drastically limited. Where possible,
we must avoid legal structures which force those who merely carry
messages to screen their content.

  Carriers are often legally prohibited from screening messages

  In fact, under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of
1986, electronic communication service providers are generally
prohibited from examining the contents of messages or information
carrier from one subscriber to another.

  Extension of the 900 number rules to all electronic information
services may be unconstitutional

  The regulation of indecent 900 number programming was only
accomplished after nearly a decade of constitutional litigation, with
rules being overturned by the Supreme Court. The regulations were
finally found constitutional only after being substantially narrowed
to meet First Amendment scrutiny. Since the access methods offered by
online service providers are significantly different than simple
telephone access to 900 services, we doubt that the same
constitutional justifications would support the newly expanded rules.
This issue requires considerable study and analysis.

  Content creators, or those who represent the content as their
own, should be responsible for liability arising out of the content

  In sum, it should be content originators, not carriers, who are
FidoNews 11-39                 Page: 16                    26 Sep 1994

responsible for their content. Any other approach will stifle the
free flow of information in the new digital media.

IV.  Next Steps

  Having only just received the language offered by Senator Exon,
EFF still needs to do further analysis, and consult with others in the
online community. We also hope to speak with Senator Exon's staff to
understand their intent. Another important hearing will be held on
S.1822 in mid-September by the Senate Judiciary Committee. By that
time, we hope to have this issue resolved. While we agree that these
carrier liability problems are in need of Congressional consideration,
we do not believe that the time is ripe to act. Before any action is
taken, hearings must be held and careful evaluation of all the issues,
not just indecency, must be undertaken.
