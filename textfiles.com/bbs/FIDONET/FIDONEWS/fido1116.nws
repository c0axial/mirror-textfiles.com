========================================================================
  It seems that things go in spurts. Last week we had hardly
enough articles to put the snooze out the door, and this week we
have nine articles.

  There are two (count 'em) articles on parties ... I guess
someone reads this thing, anyway. Perhaps we should make it a
point to post all net parties here in the snooze this summer<s>
... that would give us all something to head for on a friday
night. <no! we need more technical articles(ed.sub2)>

  Thanks to Siem Wiel for enlightening us that Brad Templeton
is the author of the "Dear Emily Postnews" stuff.

  Some more cactii sprouted from SEEDS. Interesting, how such
intricate developments require only a bit of fluid and a seeds.
The bubble plant experiment is growing slowly, although i still
don't know whether vines sprout magically or with determination
[i meant, with intuition or superstition], because i became
impatient and cut a vine to watch it grow more desperately.
Thing was, one end of the vine was stuck in an old medicine
bottle full of water. The other end of the vine was attatched
to the rest of the plant and roots. I wanted to see if the damp
end would grow roots in the context of the other vines. I waited
three whole days, and it did not, so i cut the vine so it HAD to
grow it's own roots.

   Randomness,   Yay,    Hey!

impatience does not
equal impotence.
some plans need time
time more time and then
details still
get screwed so
for getting anything
done congrats

Is there an electronic art gallery yet?
Who's out there?

Snooze filler...

"Dear Emily Postnews"

[Written specifically for USENET, but applies to echomail too. Author
unknown. Please step forward!]

        Emily Postnews, foremost authority on proper net behaviour,
        gives her advice on how to act on the net:
-       -       -       -       -       -       -       -       -
Dear Emily: Today I posted an article and forgot to include my
signature.  What should I do?  -- forgetful@myvax

A: Dear Forgetful: Rush to your terminal right away and post an
article that says, "Oops, I forgot to post my signature with that last
article.  Here it is."

Since most people will have forgotten your earlier article,
(particularly since it dared to be so boring as to not have a nice,
juicy signature) this will remind them of it.  Besides, people care
much more about the signature anyway.  See the previous letter for
more important details.

Also, be sure to include your signature TWICE in each article.  That
way you're sure people will read it.

                               ------
Q: How can I choose what groups to post in?

A: Pick as many as you can, so that you get the widest audience.
After all, the net exists to give you an audience.  Ignore those who
suggest you should only use groups where you think the article is
highly appropriate.  Pick all groups where anybody might even be
slightly interested.

Always make sure followups go to all the groups.  In the rare event
that you post a followup which contains something original, make sure
you expand the list of groups.  Never include a "Followup-to:" line in
the header, since some people might miss part of the valuable
discussion in the fringe groups.

                                ------
Q: How about an example?

A: Ok.  Let's say you want to report that Gretzky has been traded from
the Oilers to the Kings.  Now right away you might think
rec.sport.hockey would be enough.  WRONG.  Many more people might be
interested.  This is a big trade!  Since it's a NEWS article, it
belongs in the news.* hierarchy as well.  If you are a news admin, or
there is one on your machine, try news.admin.  If not, use news.misc.

The Oilers are probably interested in geology, so try sci.geo.fluids.
He is a big star, so post to sci.astro, and sci.space because they are
also interested in stars.  And of course comp.dcom.telecom because he
FidoNews 11-16                 Page:  4                    18 Apr 1994

was born in the birthplace of the telephone.  And because he's
Canadian, post to soc.culture.Ontario.southwestern.  But that group
doesn't exist, so cross-post to news.groups suggesting it should be
created.  With this many groups of interest, your article will be
quite bizarre, so post to talk.bizarre as well.  (And post to
comp.std.mumps, since they hardly get any articles there, and a "comp"
group will propagate your article further.)

You may also find it is more fun to post the article once in each
group.  If you list all the newsgroups in the same article, some
newsreaders will only show the the article to the reader once!  Don't
tolerate this.
                                ------

Here in Region 19 we've been doing our own "Poor Man's
FidoCon" for several years.  This is a kick-back and relax
type of event for those that would rather have water fights
and sleep in tents than put on a tie and stay in a hotel.

Patty and Remus like these events so much that they decided
to get married at one.  :-)  Attendance is certainly not
limited to members of Region 19...  Come see Patty get
obligatorily thrown into the lake in her wedding gown!

               Announcing the 1994 Region 19
              Poor Man's FidoCon & Lake Party!

      When:   Friday 13 May 1994 to Sunday 15 May 1994
       Where:   Big Creek Park @ Lake Somerville, TX

             Planned & Semi-Planned Activities:
             ----------------------------------

Fri night -  Setting up camps, resting & schmoozing.
Saturday  -  Volleyball, more schmoozing.
          -  Policy & PGP discussions/arguments.
          -  Wedding of Remus (380/25) & Patty (380/5)
          -  Reception (PARTY - dining & drinking event)
Sunday    -  Hangover(s), break camp

 * In other words, there are no real 'plans' other than the
wedding & party to follow.  Ideas & suggestions are welcome
both before and during the PMF&LP!

Rocks in the head?
Rock_Picker  (1:106/3323)

Hello there, fellow FIDO email nuts and other bored folks.

   We have a new echo forming at 106/113 that is ROCKs in
the head! I am speaking of ROCK_PICKER, the echo of choice for
those who know their schist about agates, corundums, hematites
and just about any sort of mineral under the sun. If you are a
geologist, prospector, jeweler or any other flavour of rock
fancier this is the echo for you!

  ...but wait! There's more! We are so into rocks that we will
even allow and actually encourage talk about DIRT! You heard it
here first, we are talking about dirt...real dirt...volcanic
soils in Arkansas, oolite underpinnings of the Florida Keys,
even East Texas GUMBO clay! I know, it's hard to contain
yourselves...BUT THERE IS EVEN MORE! Alluvial deposits,mass
fossilization layers, thrusts, veins and gosh only knows what
else we can come up with.

  I know, it sounds too good to be true, but WAIT! Every
single sysop that signs up for the ROCK_PICKER echo will get
their very own FEED.  I  know,I  know,  you  wonder  to
yourself..."Self...what is in it for me?"

  Well, that is the beauty of this echo. It is it's own
justification! It's great, trust me. If you put this echo on
your BBS, there will be rock enthusiasts beating the doors down
to get at it! I am serious! Think of it,hundreds of geologists
will call your BBS _home_! I can't think of a better bunch to
have around, to be honest. They are trustworthy, loyal and they
make great watchdogs.

  SO, I guess you are about to launch yourself out of your
warm schmoozy "bbsing chair" and head over to your nearest
netmail directory to rip off the most urgent letter of your
FidoNews 11-16                 Page:  6                    18 Apr 1994

life...the one that gets you YOUR VERY OWN PERSONAL PRIMARY feed
to the ROCK_PICKER echo! Well, do it...you'll be running in a
crowd of tens or even dozens as you fight your way into Brian
Shreve's inbound through the undulating throngs of others
wanting to get access to the best (in my opinion) echo on the
planet.

                   For your access to ROCK_PICKER netmail:

                    Brian Shreve, Sysop 1:106/113

    Thats.......

IMAGINET RPG Network
by Carl Enchelmayer

We have started a new up and coming RPG Fido-style Network for Fidonet
compatible systems.  It is a message network designed to cater to the
role-playing gamer and computer RPG gamer.

There are various topic of all major role-playing and war games, as well
as active text-based RPG echos.

Currently the net is small, which is good for new online role-playing
games to startup.  I would like to increase the size of the net, and am
looking for people to HUB all across the country.

If you would like to learn more about Imaginet...then please FREQ
"IMAGINET" from my node (1:232/305).

Thanks in advance,

Carl Enchelmayer

Routing Z1 to Z4

Yup.  This is because it was on hold at 1:105/42 for 4:4/1 as mail
for Z4 has been since about 1991, when I stopped delivering to
Argentina when the whole country was 'disappeared'.  Unfortunately,
the recent Z4 "Pablo plays politics" gang decided they no longer
wanted to get their mail.  They have the right to make that
decision, and if Z4 does not like the results you are welcome to
resolve your internal Z4 problems within Z4.

With the IC's consent, the Brasilians have started to do the job
that Z4's zonegate and ZC should be doing.  You owe them thanks,
otherwise you might never have gotten your message.

INTERNATIONAL RACISM FORUM
Bernie Wilt, FidoNet 1:114/156

The International RACISM Forum has been accessed by many people
over the last couple years, on the PIONEER NET INTERNATIONAL
backbone.  It is now being made available to those with "FidoNet"
addresses.

The subject of "racism" is a hot issue - worldwide.  For many,
it has been a difficult matter in which to share their thoughts
and beliefs, without the discomfort of personal contact.

The International Racism Forum gives people of any color (race)
a place to address this important issue with little or no
inhibitions.  The array of expression within this forum is
increasingly interesting and informative.

Racism is an issue of extreme importance to the health of any
civilization.  How people respond to the problems associated with
racism has an vital impact on society and its affairs.  Racism can
be found at the very heart of not a few historical events.

The International Racism Forum provides you, and the users of your
Bulletin Board, a professional means of communicating concerns and
perhaps solutions, regarding racism, to the peoples of the world.

Become a participant today!

Here's how:

    (Tagname "RACISM.PNI" [without quotes])

    Moderator:

        NETMAIL Bernie Wilt at 1:114/156 (ZyXEL 19.2 V.32b,
        V.42b) and request access to the International RACISM
        Forum.  Include your session PASSWORD and ARCHIVE
FidoNews 11-16                 Page: 14                    18 Apr 1994

        preference in the request.

    Co-Moderator

        NETMAIL Pam Cammack at 1:352/19 (Digicom Eagle+ 14.4
        V.32b,  V.42b) and request access to the International
        RACISM  Forum.  Include your session PASSWORD and ARCHIVE
        preference in the request.

        (NOTE: It cost as much to call from coast to coast as it
               does a bordering state (sometimes even the same
               state).  An echo polled late at night will not
               cost much at all!  You'd be surprised - give it
               a trial!)

           FReq: "PIONEER" (without quotes) for information
           about PIONEER NET INTERNATIONAL.

If you'd like to have a look at the GUIDELINES first, simply
file request "IRF" (without quotes).

We hope to hear from you soon in the International RACISM Forum!

Stormnet

 * What Is StormNet?

     StormNet is an alternative network for use with FidoNet compatible
software  (QWK hub available).  We pass messages back and forth both in
netmail and  in  echomail  conferences.   In  StormNet,  each  node  is
welcomed  and assisted in many ways by other StormNet members.  We have
active echomail areas and a growing file echo selection.  Our  echomail
traffic  is  growing every day, and are now pulling more mail ever than
before. StormNet has a friendlier atmosphere than can be found in  many
other networks.

     StormNet  has been in existence for over a year and a half, and in
that time, has grown significantly.  Our membership has changed from an
inexperienced  group  of  local  nodes to a more mature group of people
from all over the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia.   Currently,
we have over 200 nodes in StormNet, and are expanding every week!
FidoNews 11-16                 Page: 15                    18 Apr 1994


 * Why is StormNet here?

     StormNet  was  started  for a few reasons.  When we created it, we
wanted to serve teens, adults, and  others  worldwide  with  a  quality
alternative  network  that is relatively cheap to pull in.  Most of our
high speed transfers take less than a minute.  You don't have  to  poll
every  day,  we  are  flexible  and will allow you to poll whenever you
like.  We want to serve you with the finest quality echomail and  files
for  you and your users.  We are considerably smaller than FidoNet, and
therefore do not have the overflow of  mail/files  often  seen  in  its
conferences.  The average cost per month for one who pulls StormNet and
polls daily is around $6.00-7.00 within the US.

 * What are the rules like?

     StormNet?  Rules?  You've got to be kidding me.   Well,  it's  not
like  we don't have any rules; all of the rules in our policy statement
basically stem from one basic principle  -  "Be  nice  and  use  common
sense."  The  policy's  specifics were written to outline some problems
which may potentially arise when  people  aren't  nice  and  don't  use
common sense.

     The  SNAC  (StormNet  Advisory Council) helps to ensure the smooth
running of StormNet affairs.  StormNet does not discriminate because of
age, sex, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, beliefs, taste
in food, opinion on world politics,  or  favorite  color.   We  welcome
anyone  who is interested in joining a fun network to try out StormNet.
We also don't allow "bashing", spindling or other forms  of  mutilation
of groups in our newsletters, or any of our echos (excluding WAR_ZONE),
and other parts of our network.

 * What are the echos like?

     We have a variety of conferences to suit most needs.  If you are a
user  of  StormNet,  or  a node, you can request an echo if you feel it
would be active.  We have echos on many subjects, A to  Z  (as  we  say
SN_A   to   SN_Z).    We  have  a  talented  staff  of  moderators  and
co-moderators, and combined  with  the  efforts  of  our  international
echomail  coordinator, keep the network running smoothly.  We generally
create 25-35k of echomail daily.

 * What are the file echos like?

     We offer file echos for our nodes too.  Although we  will  not  go
into  this  matter  much  in this article, we have great files from all
around.  We don't allow trash to be hatched in  our  echos.   Our  file
echo coordinator helps to coordinate our file echos.

 * Internet...  Yes, Internet!

     Added  just recently, Internet!  StormNet is now registered in the
domain listings as "storm.net".  All StormNet nodes can  use  our  UUCP
host to send messages anywhere on Internet.  No cost!

FidoNews 11-16                 Page: 16                    18 Apr 1994

 * Nodelists, Policies, and Newsfiles..

     Our nodelist coordinator is dedicated to his nodelist management..
He strives to make sure the nodelist that is released is as accurate as
possible.   The  nodelist  coordinator  has never secretly switched the
nodelist for new Folgers' Crystals :-)

     In almost all cases, our nodelists and  nodediffs  are  issued  by
Friday  at 12am.  In fact, we usually issue most periodicals before the
Friday deadline.  To make  less  calls  necessary,  all  of  StormNet's
documents are released at about the same time.

 * Support

     StormNet  has  support sites for different types of softwares.  We
currently have technical support nodes/echos for BinkleyTerm,  Maximus,
Storm Watch Software, RemoteAccess, and T.A.G..

     New  technical  support nodes for other software are permitted and
encouraged.  When you apply for technical support, you will get a  flag
in  the  nodelist designating you as a support site.  You also get your
name added to the list of technical support nodes at the bottom of  the
nodelist.   And  finally,  you  have the option to add file and message
echos software you support.

 * What we're looking for

     StormNet is looking for nodes who want to  pull  in  high  quality
echomail  at  a relatively cheap price.  Ones who think they would like
StormNet to be on their BBSes or computers.

     We are currently looking for one (1) RC within  the  USA,  (4)  in
Canada, (8) in Europe, and (9) in Asia.

     We  also  are  looking  for  new  zones  to  create  all the time.
StormNet is not just limited to North  America,  other  continents  and
countries  are  already setup and joined, but we would like more.  We'd
like to expand StormNet worldwide, and we  think  that  everyone  would
benefit  from  this  and  it  would  strengthen relations between other
nations.  We'd be willing to work with you to install  a  new  zone  in
your country/continent.

     Not only are we looking for the above positions, but we're looking
for  NC's  everywhere  that  would  be  willing  to  call   LD   to   a
RHub/ZHub/IHub  and  distribute  mail to your area.  We are looking for
NC's everywhere we don't already have one.

 * Why should I consider StormNet?

     We respect each and every StormNet member and his/her rights.   We
offer our services to all.  We have a great network setup.  We want all
to join and have a good time in  the  network  that  we  have  created.
We're  proud  of  our network.  If you have any questions, feel free to
contact any of the nodes listed below.  We'd be glad to help you.
