     Greetings,

     Hope you had a good Christmas and did not indulge yourself into
     too many nice things. ;-)  If you did, you may find yourself a
     few pounds/kg havier.

     I would like to thank all of YOU who contributed during the past year
     and hope sincerely, that you will continue doing the great work in
     1999.

     Why we have seen nothing from the ZC's & IC during the past year?
     Whatever it was, lets hope that we WILL see something from those
     gentleman during 1999.

     Have a great time and if you intend to blow away some of your hard
     earned cash on fire crackers and the likes, do it in such a manner
     that nobody gets hurt and keep them crakers away from your pets.
     Any animal for that matter!

     Like if you did not know, this IS the last issue for 1998 and will
     see you all in 1999.

     Happy New Year,

                    Reply to Bob Moravsik by Douglas Myers

     > Some of you may have read the drivel posted by Douglas Myers

     Please note that I didn't need to resort, as you do, to calling
     individuals a "twit" or "tamperer" to present my arguement.  Let the
     readers decide who is posting drivel here :)


     > Most of his article describes the world through the eyes of a person
     > to argues that reality is what he claims.
       ^-- who

     Did you expect me to argue that reality is not what I claim?


     > The real issue (and only issue) is:  "Do the Elist keeper resolve
     > disputes ?"                           ^-- Does

     Actually, the elist keeper has been called upon to resolve several
     disputes lately.  There was a dispute over listing multiple
     moderators, a dispute over allowing listings with spaces, a dispute
     over the way listings were permitted to expire, and others.  The
     elist keeper was expected to resolve each one.


     > What's LaCostaPol ?   Its this secret set of rules that only Thom
     > LaCosta knows.

     Where's the secret?  Thom has stated consistantly that he recognizes
     the moderator of an echo as the individual responsible for
     maintaining the elist entry.  If it's a secret, it isn't very well
     kept.


     > There are two sides to this issue.

     > 1. Moderators "control" conferences and the elisting is their
     >    property.   This is not supported by any Fidonet policy or the
     >    laws of any nation (Remember, Fidonet is international)

     Nor has such been argued by me.  In fact, I believe that moderators
     must ultimately serve the echo participants or they will either be
     driven from the echo or abandoned to the echo.  What is actually at
     issue is the question of who speaks for the echo participants.  The
     moderator is recognized by the NAB, FidoSpine, and Elist Keeper.
     Each of these bodies looks to the moderator field in the elisting to
     determine who this spokesman is.  If you choose to call him
     "trustee" or "steward" or "owner" or whatever, that's fine... but he
     FIDONEWS 15-52               Page 3                   28 Dec 1998


     or she should be listed in the moderator field for the world to
     know.


     > 2. Moderators serve the participants.

     > If one takes the later then the elist password is seperate from the
     > moderator.

     You make this assertion, but offer no arguement as to why the
     password should be denied the moderator.  The password is little
     more than a housekey - if it's lost or stolen, then it's appropriate
     to change the locks.


     > Without guidance from Satti (who has the power to extend Fidonet
     > policy), LaCosta should not have compromised the Elist security.
     > THAT IS THE ONLY ISSUE.

     I'm not sure why Fidonet Policy should need extended here.
     Certainly it doesn't require an act of Congress if some apartment
     manager decides to change a lock after a tenant vacates... and the
     new tenant might even feel that security has been enhanced :)

     Doc Logger on the subject of Coordinator activity:
     -------------------------------------------------------------------

     I think your appraisal of the role of *Cs lets them off too lightly
     when you suggest that they haven't been obstructionist. Every action
     that Satti has taken towards Region12 or members of our region has
     been exactly that. Kohl and Hinton engaged in exactly the same
     activities, getting their knickers in a knot when nodes sought to
     join an environment where they were made welcome. It may be an
     academic point to ask how many nodes gave up in disgust when they
     encountered a Bob Hall, a Dave Hunter, a Hans Toby, a Gary Gilmore,
     or any of a raft of other people who forgot that the point was
     communication rather than turf wars.

     I'd bet my stuffed armadillo collection that you could lay all of
     the missing Montana nodes at the doorstep of an NC whose overweening
     control ambitions throttled the net...ditto for net243.

     When the ZC is paralyzed by incompetence, the tribal sense of
     belonging is lost because the sysop peasantry see the organization
     in terms of fading, semi-literate relics clinging to power which
     they weild capriciously. Even a fractional amount of initiative on
     the part of a *C can bring spirit to the enterprise, and conversely,
     a bunker-hiding *C can create the opposite effect.

     BBS =3D Bulletin Board System
     OSP =3D Online Service Provider

     Okay, now read the first two lines 3 more times. Now take a look at
     your system which you are running or logging in to. Is it more like a
     "BBS' or an "OSP", well most of you should say "OSP", as this is what
     it really is.

     The "BBS" part is still there, if you see or run an effective
     Bulletins section of the system, then call that section BBS, as the
     rest of the system is an Online Service Provider.

     It is not changing the "BBS",it is changing the name to a better well
     understood name. "BBS" is nolonger a "BBS" anymore! "BBSes" years ago
     used to only have local bulletins, but for the past 15 years or more,
     many systems do not even have 1 useful bulletin!

     FIDONEWS 15-52               Page 5                   28 Dec 1998


     Why is a "BBS" called a "BBS" when there is no Bulletins?? why? When
     you can call it an "OSP" and it sounds more like what it really is.

     Do you know where the "BBS" term came from? Well I bet most of you
     probably have no clue, it is quite simple, in the 1970's "BBS" were
     used for that very reason, to pass out bulletins to whom ever wanted
     to know, and that was all. Then one day some programming decided to
     add some extra features to their "BBS" like email support, and public
     msgs sections, eventualy it became what you see today. But today, it
     is no longer a "BBS" it is undoubtably an "OSP". The term "OSP" was
     used back then, but nobody understodd what an "OSP" was, yet they
     know what a "BBS" was, so everyone continues to use the term "BBS".
     No that term is over used in our online culture, this needs to be
     changed to it's proper term.

     I'm not saying an "OSP" has too offer internet services, but still
     can offer BBS-email (OSP-email) , online games, public message domains
     (echomail) and so on. An ISP does not offer personal online games, msg
     conferences, inter-ISP games, and so on. This can work with almost
     every feature of a "BBS" or we should say "OSP".


     Overall, if you think about what a "BBS" is today, it can offer a lot
     and I do mean a heck of a lot more services than any ISP can offer to
     it's customers (users) and most "BBS"'s of today are free, if not
     really cheap for extra and special accesses.


     It all just makes more sence this way. We can be powerful systems once
     again. The time is here. The technology is here. The market is here
     more than ever. Lets use it.


     All an "OSP" needs to be called an "OSP" is, what all "BBS"s have now.
     and if there are _NO_ usefull bulletins, then is _NOT_ a "BBS" at all.
     A "BBS" has bulletins. An "OSP" has any other online service
     available, and this DOES NOT have to be an internet service; just
     services like online games, public message domains, multi-node chat,
     local private email. Sounds familair?

     Just think, try to explain "BBS" to someone who never loged on to one.
     What do they think is on it? bulletins. Are people always attracted to
     bulletins? no. If you say "OSP" what will they think? "humm sounds
     interesting, I wonder what services they offer.", and voila you get
     some new users. And from there, it is your system that should attract
     them.

     Please try to inform other users and SysOps in your area somehow on
     what an OSP is and that BBS is only a section of an OSP. Work
     together, and this old, yet not used very often term will be in it
     correct place.

     Doesn't it just make more sence?

     Please pass this information on to your NEC, ZEC, and other local
     SysOps.  thanx

     Revitalizing Middle Tennessee Net BBSes

     An Attempt at Revitalizing Net 116 BBSes
     by John Graves, 1:116/35, Net116@nashville.com

     In the article in Fidonews Volume 15, Number 8, entitled
     "Revitalizing a Small Part of Fidonet" by Neil Hoener, 1:128/103,
     Mr. Hoener describes one of the ways that Pikes Peak Net is trying
     to revitalize their BBSes. The Pikes Peak Net asked Hilgraeve Inc.
     for permission to include icons for their BBSes along with an
     upgrade for HyperTerminal 3.0.

     For those who may be unfamiliar with HyperTerminal, it is the basic
     terminal program Microsoft includes with Windows 95, 98, and NT 4.0.
     Shortly after Windows 95 was released, Hilgraeve began offering an
     upgrade to the version included with Windows. This upgrade is free
     for personal use and can be registered for business use for a small
     fee. This upgrade turns HyperTerminal into a full-featured terminal
     program that is quite suitable for calling Fidonet BBSes.

     Inspired by that article, I contacted Hilgraeve and asked for
     permission to create an install program that would upgrade the
     HyperTerminal software that comes with Windows to Hilgraeve's
     HyperTerminal 4.0 Personal Edition and include "connectoids", links
     that can be placed on the Windows desktop or anywhere on a Windows
     95/98/NT computer, to allow users to call Middle Tennessee Net BBSes
     with a simple click of their mouse.

     Within 36 hours, a representative of Hilgraeve contacted me and gave
     me their permission. Hilgraeve is quite willing to allow Fidonet
     Sysops to bundle our BBS connect icons with the upgrade of their
     product. All they ask is that we send them a copy of the finished
     install for them to keep for their records and that we do not charge
     for the upgrade.

     We are planning to advertise this upgrade via flyers distributed at
     local computer stores and on our WWW pages. We'll send a copy free
     of charge to anyone requesting it. While we will make this available
     on floppy disk upon request, we think most of the distribution will
     be done by downloads from web pages and file attaches in email. As
     a result, the cost to our net will be minimal. I urge anyone searching
     for a way to increase callers to their BBS to give this method a try.

     FIDONET IN THE 2ND MILLENIUM
     FIDONEWS 15-52               Page 7                   28 Dec 1998


        - An Article by Pete Snidal, Sysop of 1:353.910
             - Compuglobal Hypermeganet BBS -

        Okay, I know the title's a little too catchy; but it says
     something important.  Fidonet _does_ have a place in the next
     millenium.  The internet hasn't killed what Fidonet does, and it
     certainly hasn't replaced it. This little article intends to
     discuss a few things I think we need to consider as owner/
     operators of Fidonet systems.

        Here is what Fidonet does best: It provides low-cost access
     to a broad range of Forums/discussion areas which foster
     communication between computer users all over the planet.  These
     Fidoechoes are spam-free, friendly, and easy to use.  They cover a
     very broad potential range of subjects, and are moderated to ensure
     a fair to good selectivity of information (staying on topic.)

        If we, as sysops, can hold onto this basic idea, and try to
     provide at least one system in every possible calling area which
     operates with this basic aim in mind, Fido will live on for a long
     time.

        There's room for gameboards out there, I suppose, but I think
     it's important to keep the worldwide conference connectivity aspect
     in the foreground.

        What does this mean to the average sysop?  It means that, if we
     want to see Fido stay in business, we must publicize its availabilty
     in our area, and we must have our systems set up so that any
     would-be users who call them will be greeted by user-friendly,
     properly configured software presenting a good basic set of
     Fidoechoes covering a wide range of interests.

        I think it's important to offer a good general list of echoes in
     the smorgasbord; areafixing and configuring a few echoes you
     personally may not be particularly interested in will bring more
     participants to Fido, and will have to improve the quality and
     quantity of participation in _all_ echoes in the long run.
     Including your favourites.

        Preferably, the Message Menu will show a hierarchical listing of
     available echoes, starting at the first level with no more than a
     screenful of headings, such as:

             Local Messaging
             Environmental Issues
             Hobbies
             Humour
             News Postings
             Politics
             Technical Subjects
             Writing

        and probably a further set of special interest echoes, such as

             Health
     FIDONEWS 15-52               Page 8                   28 Dec 1998


             Women's Issues
             Men's Issues
             Teen Stuff
             Kids Stuff

        and from this main message menu, the user should then be able to
     make a choice and get a breakdown of any of the given headings to
     all the echoes which are relevant.  Politics, for example, could
     break down into National Politics, Provincial Politics, Local
     Politics, Party of Your Choice, etc.

        What is Very Important is that the front-end software be
     intuitive as possible, and that it gives access to a good general
     interest range of message areas.  The intelligent would-be user
     can be counted on, I think, to make a fairly decent effort to figure
     out the navigation, if given half a chance.  It isn't important that
     it be GUI or even graphical, I don't think, since text conferencing
     is the basic issue here - if he can't bother to take the time to
     read the instructions, or is completely rodent-dependent, what
     contributions will s/he make to the conferences anyway?

        Something we have to consider is that the new user, unlike
     ourselves, must at first depend on the front-end software to
     navigate the message base.   We who have long ago graduated to
     offline readers, such as Harvey Parisien's excellent OFFLINE, or the
     even better alternative of TIMED, sometimes tend to forget what it
     was like to dial our first bbs and try to navigate around the
     message base.  If it was too difficult, as many of them are, we most
     likely jumped into a game door, and thus were lost to Fidonet as
     conference contributors, in some cases pretty well forever.  Other
     prospective users, having discovered that the Internet, as well as
     the real game computers such as Nintendo et al, do games so much
     better and thus also are lost forever.  So it's very important to
     present a properly set up front end of good quality, with a good
     basic set of conferencing echoes to the new user from the git-go.

     A really necessary item in bbs front-end software is that it offers
     the user a chance to see a L)ist of messages available in any base,
     showing one line per message of such information as originator,
     destination, and title.  Without this option, software which
     replies to the R)ead a Message command with a request for a message
     number is pretty meaningless.  And if the user has the good humour
     to offer up a message number at random (unlikely - alt-h is more
     likely) and unluckily picks a private message, s/he gets nothing for
     his/her trouble, and is now getting really discouraged.  Listing of
     messages is a very important feature.

        The best example of good front-end software, offering this
     feature, hierachical menus, a good shot at intuitive user-friendly
     navigation, and still selling for the amazing price of * FREE *, is
     my personal favourite, Maximus 2.03.  If it scared you once, and you
     shone it on because of all those scary *.ctl files and stuff, have
     another look at it now. You've likely become much more computer-savvy
     since then, and it'll look a whole lot simpler.

        Why am I writing this?  Well, although a grunt sysop in a small

     town in interior British Columbia, I'm currently on a visit to the
     Big Smoke, Vancouver - home of net 153.  I brought a computer along,
     and thought I'd peruse the nodelist, and see what good ideas I could
     take home with me for my own system.  And I've found a few good
     ideas, but what I've found a lot more of is reasons why Fidonet is
     dying.  Poorly configured systems with badly-chosen, in a word,
     crappy front ends.  Message menus running to many screens of very
     limited-interest technical echoes which should show to the new user
     as one item on the first hierarchical menu screen.  No choices of
     the most basic echoes of general interest, such as WORLDTLK, ANEWS,
     LOC.BUYSELL (a BC-wide echo), BC_CHAT, BC_TEEN, ALTMED, FUNNY,
     or SIMPSONS.  No indication that other echoes are possible, if the
     interest is expressed, let alone a list of these.

        There are a number of echoes we all should carry as "bait" to
     encourage would-be's to become regular users of Fidonet, whether
     we personally have any particular interest in them or not.  Check
     the 'bone list for ideas.

        I ran into 'way too many "attitude" systems, with the sysop's
     cunning bulletins basically saying this-is-my-system-and-I-don't-
     care-if-you-ever-call-back-get-screwed.  I have no quarrel with this
     attitude, if the number of the bbs is not publicized on the nodelist
     and/or on the various lists of bbs's available, but if you're
     showing this kind of attitude on a bbs representing Fidonet, I for
     one really wish you'd change your listing to private, since that's
     obviously what you had in mind in the first place.  In other words,
     don't invite people to Fidonet, and then tell them to screw off.

        The only thing that's going to save Fidonet is attracting and
     holding contributors to the echoes.  This is good for all of us, and
     good for them as well.  Fidonet's conferencing is a valuable
     resource which a lot more people would be using if they were
     introduced to it through properly configured, hospitable local
     bbs's, and those of us who care should really do all we can to make
     this service available to prospective users.
