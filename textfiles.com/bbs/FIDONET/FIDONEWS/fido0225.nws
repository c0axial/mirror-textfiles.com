                      Backwards vs. Upwards Compatible

        There's a bit of a battle that starts up whenever people get 
        together and start discussing upgrading a piece of software.  
        The question being, how should the new package be compatible 
        with the existing package?  (Or even, should it be 
        compatible?) 

        The two main ways to make a new package compatible with its 
        older cousins are "upward compatibility" and "backward 
        compatibility".  

        A package is upward compatible if the new version will still 
        work wherever the old version worked.  An example of this 
        might be a new compiler that can still compile programs 
        written for an earlier version of the language.  Upwards 
        compatibility means that the newest version will always 
        work.  

        A package is backward compatible if the old version will 
        still work wherever the new version worked.  An example of 
        this would be a squeeze utility whose output is acceptible 
        to older versions of the unsqueezer.  Backwards

        compatibility means that the older versions will always 
        work.  

        In the micro community, where program updates sometimes 
        percolate slowly through the user base, backwards 
        compatibility is clearly desireable.  But is it always 
        acheivable?  

        Upward compatibility is usually not hard to implement.  If 
        necessary, older format data files can be converted to the 
        newer format as they are needed.  The price (everything has 
        a price) is in added program complexity and in larger 
        program size, since the program may have to deal with a 
        large number of data formats, commands, and so forth that 
        are no longer needed in the new version.  

        Backward compatibility is usually much harder to achieve.  
        It often calls for fancy tricks (ie. kludges) to fit in new 
        data, commands, structures, and so forth in a way that won't 
        choke the older programs.  An ingenious example of this is a 
        method someone came up with for tucking date and time data 
        into a squeezed file by putting it AFTER the squeezed data 
        (where a normal USQ doesn't even look).  In a great many 
        cases this sort of trick is not possible.  

        There also comes a time in every program's life where you 
        just have to chuck the whole compatibility issue and start 
        fresh.  Versions and variations proliferate -- especially in 
        the micro community -- to the point where it becomes nearly 
        impossible to accomodate them all.  Sooner or later the 
        price to pay for compatibility (of ANY sort) grows too high.  
        As an absurd example, imagine if you will a far-future 
        program (call it ZUSQ1e3) which can unsqueeze any squeezed 
        file ever created by any of several hundred different 
        variations (present and past) of SQ.  Who in their right 
        mind is going to want to save, load, and use a 300k program 
        to perform a basic task that a 16k .COM file can handle?  

        We'd all like to think that our programs are immortal, but 
        the sad fact is that everything eventually fades away.  The 
        machine you use today will be obsolete in five years (if it 
        isn't already!)  The true answer to the question of 
        compatibility is to give it an honest try, but don't go nuts 
        about it.

                 A CRY FOR HELP - FOUR UNRELATED QUESTIONS
                    By Steve Lemke, Sysop, Fido 102/378
                        Voice Phone: (805) 968-7360
                           =====================
                                      
        IBM PC-AT SPEEDUP CRYSTAL SET:
             Recently, although  I can't  remember exactly  where or
        when, I  read an  article or  letter from  someone  in  some
        magazine about  speedup crystals  for the  IBM PC-AT.   They
        mentioned that  they had tried a Radio Shack crystal and had
        nothing but problems.  Then they said that there was a place
        in the  Los Angeles  area somewhere that sold a set of three
        (3) crystals for the IBM PC-AT.  Included in the set was a 8
        Mhz. crystal,  a 9  Mhz. crystal, and a 10 Mhz crystal.  The
        idea is,  try the  10 Mhz. first, and if for some reason you
        have problems, you can drop down to the 9 Mhz. or even the 8
        Mhz.   Any one  of these  three crystals  is easy to plug in
        after removing  the existing (socketed!) 6 Mhz. crystal from
        the system  board of the PC-AT.  This is all fine and dandy,
        except that  I can't for the life of me remember where I saw
        this article,  letter, or  whatever it was.  If anyone knows
        where I  can get  this set  of crystals,  or a  similar set,
        please let me know A.S.A.P.!!  Thanks.

        ANYONE WRITING A BBS FOR MS-DOS PLEASE READ THIS:
             I am  in need of a BBS for a PC-Compatible.  It must be
        written in either Turbo Pascal (preferably) or "C", with the
        source code  available.   Hopefully this BBS will be able to
        both send  and receive  FidoNet Mail.   I  don't  want  this
        system for  a BBS,  but to  modify  it  into  an  electronic
        ordering system  for a mail-order company.  The system would
        then be  installed on  a toll-free phone number where people
        could call and get listings of products available.  Then, by
        hitting a  few keys,  they could  call up  a more  extensive
        product description,  and by  hitting a  few more they could
        place an  order for  the  product.    If  the  program  were
        compatible with  FidoNet, then  orders could  also be placed
        via FidoNet  Mail.   If you  are writing  or have  written a
        program that might work for me, please contact me A.S.A.P.!!
             I  also  have  a  friend  who  is  in  the  process  of
        converting the  CP/M "Citadel  BBS" program (written in "C")
        to MS-DOS.   He  is in  need of a communications driver that
        will work  with MS-DOS  and "C" for use in this Citadel BBS.
        Please contact me if you can be of assistance to him.

        SHOULD USERS BE ALLOWED TO DOWNLOAD FIDOLIST & FIDONEWS?

             I realize  that many  systems offer  FidoNet  software,
        documentation, newsletters,  and nodelists in their download
        areas, but  if I'm  running a  board that does not have Fido
        available for  downloading, should  I let  my users download
        FidoNews and  FidoLists?   There are  often  some  sensitive
        articles in  FidoNews (like things Sysops should be aware of
        that users don't need to know about) that lead me to believe







FIDONEWS     --           05 Aug 85  16:04:31           Page 4

        that users  shouldn't be  allowed to  read it.  Other times,
        there are  general articles  that seem  like the users might
        benefit from.   I  never really  liked the idea of having to
        'censor'  the   FidoNews  just  to  make  it  available  for
        downloading, but there are times when they don't need to see
        everything.   I recently decided to make the FidoList avail-
        able to  users so they could download the whole list of Fido
        systems (minus the private ones) and see where they can send
        mail to.   I  think with  the recent articles about Anti-BBS
        laws, I'm  going to  allow users  to download FidoNews also.
        I'm not  really asking  for a  "YES" or  "NO" answer to this
        question, but just trying to open this up for discussion.

        LASTLY, WHAT IS THIS HALLEY'S COMET STUFF??

             What is  the purpose  of the Halley's Comet and Voyager
        event listings  in "The  Interrupt  Stack"?    Perhaps  just
        something to  fill up  what  would  otherwise  be  an  empty
        calendar?   Well, if  we're that  desperate for  events, you
        could always list my next birthday - May 19, 1986.

        BBS PRESS SERVICE OFFERS FREE ISSUE OF 
        INFO-MAT MAGAZINE TO FIDO-NET SYSOPS 

        FIDO-NET sysops run one of the finest BBS packages ever 
        written and they know it.  Now, thanks to THE BBS PRESS 
        SERVICE, they can make their systems TRULY unique -- 
        attracting REGULAR callers who can count on their local 
        FIDO-NET for the very latest news, information, and 
        features. It's easy with INFO-MAT Magazine, from The BBS 
        Press Service (BPS).  INFO-MAT is an exciting new weekly 
        electronic publication that FIDO-NET sysops can post on 
        their own BBS's.  Each issue of INFO-MAT serves up a 
        generous helping of text (50 - 70K). The topics covered 
        include computer and software news, video and consumer 
        electronics news, movie, software and hardware reviews, 
        informative features about ANYTHING electronic, and 
        editorials to get your users thinking.  The best news, 
        however, is that a FIDO-NET sysop can put EVERY issue of 
        INFO-MAT on his or her BBS for as little as $3.12 per week!
                 
        INFO-MAT can be downloaded directly from The BPS BBS, a 24-
        hour bulletin board system, or delivered on disk, in formats 
        compatible with most popular computers.  According to BPS' 
        publisher, Alan R. Bechtold, their affiliates regularly 
        report increases of 20% to 25% in the number of callers 
        accessing their systems once INFO-MAT is put online.  This 
        makes it the perfect addition to a board, and it doesn't 
        matter to BPS whether an affiliate charges an initial access 
        fee or runs it wide open and free.  Businesses and computer 
        clubs easily draw regular callers by running INFO-MAT, too.  
        Many BPS affiliates pay the entire cost of carrying INFO-
        MAT, including the monthly fee and all telephone or postage 
        charges -- often with a profit -- by charging their users a 
        small yearly access fee of $5 - $15.  Others have found 
        local merchants more than willing to pay the entire cost, in 
        return for mention as an INFO-MAT Sponsor.  Since BPS 
        doesn't force their affiliates to charge for access or tell 
        them how much to charge if they do, INFO-MAT can be put 
        online any way the affiliate sysop wants to -- reaping the 
        benefits he or she wants most from it.
                 
        Each issue of INFO-MAT is a series of ten or more separate 
        ASCII text files, including a separate file for each week's 
        headlines and table of contents.  Affiliate sysops place the 
        headlines for the week in a Bulletin file, let their users 
        know where they can go to find INFO-MAT, then watch them 
        call in regularly to get their favorite "printless 
        magazine." FIDO-NET users can use FIDO-NET'S "Type" option 
        to read the magazine online or download it to read at their 
        leisure.  
         
        For a limited time, the BBS PRESS SERVICE has posted a 
        special FREE sample issue on their BBS, just for FIDO-NET 
        sysops.  Give it a call.  FIDO-NET Sysops are invited to 
        look the magazine over, then download it and put it on their 
        systems, to see for themselves how much their users would 
        like to have each weekly issue available on their local

                 PUBLIC vs. PRIVATE BULLETIN BOARD SYSTEMS
                    By Steve Lemke, Sysop, Fido 102/378
                       =============================
                                      
             One thing  that's really bugged me lately is the number
        of FidoNet  systems that are either private or semi-private.
        Recently, I  wanted to  get the latest NODELIST and FIDONEWS
        files without  waiting for  my host  to get  them for me.  I
        called all  over Southern California (and even out of state)
        and all I could find were private systems!  I could see that
        some systems  had it,  but  the  download  command  was  not
        available to  me until I had been "verified" or sent in some
        written agreement,  or something  like that.   It was rather
        annoying to  have to  "identify" myself  and then  call back
        later.  Other systems that were public didn't have the file.

             I used  to run a system where people would have limited
        access until  they answered  the system  questionnaire and I
        had a  chance to  check it.  I found it to be a real pain to
        have to  go  through  the  answers  file  and  then  upgrade
        everyone manually  to a  higher status.  Recently, I changed
        the system  to a  _COMPLETELY_PUBLIC_ system,  where all new
        users can  do anything  (upload, download,  enter  messages,
        kill messages, etc.).  I added the QNEWUSER.BBS file so they
        have to  answer the  questionnaire before  they get into the
        system, and  if I  ever find  a set  of answers that are not
        acceptable, I can delete the person.

             My system  has been  *PUBLIC* for about two months now,
        and I've  had *NO* problems related to this change.  I trust
        FIDO, and I believe that it is pretty-much crash-proof.  The
        only problem  I had occurred when someone broke into another
        local system  (RBBS) and  the password of my other Sysop was
        discovered.   (Now  he  uses  different  passwords  on  each
        system!)   That enabled  our crook  to drop  into DOS  (I've
        since made  that harder!) and find out my password and cause
        all kinds of problems.  But, _THAT_WOULD_HAVE_HAPPENED_EVEN_
        _IF_MY_SYSTEM_WERE_PRIVATE!_ I enjoy having a public system,
        and I like being able to trust the users of my system.

             Incidentally, my  system is  running on  a 30MB  Compaq
        DeskPro 286  (a PC-AT  Compatible, but  30% faster:  8 Mhz).
        _THIS_SYSTEM_REALLY_FLIES!!_   Our specialty  here is IBM PC
        files of  all kinds,  and we also have some Macintosh stuff.
        The system  is up  24 hours/day  (except when the machine is
        being used  locally), so  give it  a call if you want to see
        "THE FASTEST  FIDO IN  THE WEST"  (& WORLD?)   The number is
        (805) 569-2459.  (That number again is (805) 569-2459!).

        From:     David Horowitz  Fido 107/2
        Subject:  Shipuser.com
        Date:     July 30, 1985


        To all SysOps,

        In the last fidonews there was an  article  about  shipuser.
        The article made comments about how I did not use Hex number
        to represent the file name (Like TJ does in  Mail).    Well,
        all I can say is I messed up...

        When I wrote the program I put alot of thought and time into
        designing  a  name that would be unique for all systems, yet
        still have the same extension, for easy processing.  I  came
        up  with NodeNet.USR.  It seemed like a good idea, and I did
        not remember that TJ does  similar  things  with  mail.    I
        figured under the new scheme that my name would leave enough
        room for 1000 squared nodes, and if we  even  can  close  to
        1000 nodes the Master User List would become too big anyway.
        I figured that Nets would renumber starting with  one.    It
        made sense at the time, but noooooo....

        Anyway, the program really has to stay this way.   It  would
        mean  changing  the way we process the incoming userlists if
        we changed the name of the files, so the way it is - is  the
        way it stays.

        However.  I am in the process  of  making  some  changes  to
        SHIPUSER:

                1) Removed the  question  are  you  running  10i  or
        greater, so the whole program is controlled from the command
        line,

                2) Added a feature to  allow  you  to  select  users
        greater than or less than a given privilege level.

                3) Added a feature to allow you to select users  who
        have called more than a given number of times.

        The new program will be making its way around  soon,  please
        use  it!    We  are getting a fair response, but it could be
        better.  If you would like to make  a  suggestion  to  other
        features for SHIPUSER contact me at:

        From Spiv's Fido #346 in Region #10 (408) 972-8164:

        (The ONLY FIDO devoted to the IBM PC AT)

        ********************************************************
          IBM ADMITS HARDWARE FLAW IN PC-AT!

        IBM finally admits that approx 10% of the PC-ATs shipped
        may have a defective hard disk controller card.  (IBM is
        rumored to have shipped about 300,000 PC-ATs so far.)

        IBM will replace FREE OF CHARGE any controller that is
        defective.

        Suspected units are in the following serial number range:
             5019001 to 5141250 and 0054001 to 0146900

        You can check if your system needs a new board by running
        a new IBM diagnostic program.  Every IBM PC dealer is 
        supposed to send this program to every customer that might
        have a PC-AT in the suspect serial number range.

        THIS FILE IS ON-LINE HERE IN THE UPLOAD SECTION.  SO GRAB 
        AND IT QUICKLY PUT YOUR MIND AT EASE OR GET IN LINE AT YOUR
        DEALER TO GET A REPLACEMENT BOARD.


        [Note:  "Here" means on Fido #346 at 408-972-8164]

        It is also possible to identify defective controller boards
        by visual inspection.  If the Texas Instruments IC in position
        U-19 has a suffix code of "-10" then the board should be
        replaced.

                              Fido Utilities
                        by Ben Baker - Fido 100/10
                                      
        I  am aware of a  number of home-grown programs  designed to
        perform  utilitarian  functions  for Fido  sysops.  I'm sure
        there  are twice  as many  that I  haven't heard  about.   I
        usually  find out  about them  by stumbling  across them  on
        someone  else's board.  Sometimes they drop in from the blue
        via FidoNet mail.

        It  struck me that there  is no mechanism for  disseminating
        information about these utilities.  I have therefore appoin-
        ted myself a committee of one to rectify the  situation!   I
        am  beginning a directory of  Fido utility software which  I
        will publish in this newsletter from time to time.  And with
        this  article, I begin a  semi-regular series of reviews  of
        this software.

        Now, to make this work I am going to need help from  all  of
        you.  If you have a favorite Fido utility program  you  want
        to  share, send  it to  me at  100/10 for  inclusion in  the
        directory and possibly for review here.  For the directory I
        need  the  program  name, author,  hardware  and/or software
        constraints,  language, where it can be obtained, whether or
        not  source is available and a brief abstract.  Please limit
        it  to Fido  specific utilities.   There are  so  many  good
        general  utilities  that  without this  limitation, we could
        quickly saturate.

        Now, on to my first review:


        Program Name:         SYSREPT, V1.30
        Author:               Alfred Anderson
        Constraints:          none
        Language:             Generic TURBO Pascal
        Download From:        14/61, 100/10 or 100/51
        Source Available?     NO
        Abstract:
             Produces up to five reports based on  an  analysis
             of  the  SYSOP.LOG  file. The  reports  include  a
             condensed system log, a download report, an upload
             report,  an  export  data file  and  a utilization
             summary.

        This is without doubt the best Fido reporting utility I have
        seen. It produces several useful reports in a clear, concise
        well  designed format.  It  has been successfully  tested on
        the  IBM and the DEC Rainbow, and I expect it will run OK on
        any machine.

        The only minor annoyance is that TURBO insists  on  initial-
        izing  the screen. Compiled with  IBM TURBO, any program  is
        machine-specific.   Compiled with Generic TURBO, the program
        slows significantly, but is machine-independant.

        The  reports may be directed  to any device, or  to files in







FIDONEWS     --           05 Aug 85  16:04:43           Page 13

        any  directory.  Page headings contain a user-defined "board
        name" for a personal touch.  Defaults are established  in  a
        control  file, but  all may  be overridden  by command  line
        switches.

        The  input  log  data may span several days (I run mine on a
        weekly basis), but the program assumes that it  begins  with
        the first call after midnight of the first day and ends with
        the last call before midnight of the last day.  I force this
        to  happen with  an external  event at  23:59 each  Saturday
        night.

        The condensed system log is, as its name suggests, a conden-
        sation  of SYSOP.LOG in  the form of  a very readable  daily
        log.   Each call is numbered and usually receives a one line
        entry containing user name, time on, call  duration,  number
        of  files downloaded and comments.  It is the comments field
        which  causes some  entries to  occupy more  than one  line.
        Here  such things as  invalid password entries  and uploaded
        files are noted.

        The "export" file is essentially the same data as  the  con-
        densed  log, but without page formatting or comments. It may
        be produced in comma-delimited form with ASCII  string  data
        enclosed  in quotes suitable for input to 1-2-3 or dBASE, or
        in a fixed field format for sorting or processing  by  other
        programs.

        The download report is a sorted list of all files downloaded
        during  the  period, and  the number of  times it was  down-
        loaded.  It  is produced  two columns to  a page, making  it
        compact but quite readable.

        The  upload report is a  sorted list of uploaded  files with
        the name of the user who uploaded it and the date  and  time
        of upload.

        The one page utilization report is perhaps the most impress-
        ive of the lot.  Most Sysops have only a vague notion of how
        much activity they get on their boards.  Here's  the  report
        that will give them precise information.  It begins  with  a
        histogram  of percent utilization vs.  hour of the day.   It
        then lists several useful statistics such as number of calls
        at each baud rate, total number of calls, total total avail-
        able time, total logged time overall percent of utilization,
        average call duration, etc..  For one page, it is chock full
        of useful information.

        In summary, Anderson has put a lot of careful  thought  into
        this one, and I don't think any Fido Sysop should be without
        it.
