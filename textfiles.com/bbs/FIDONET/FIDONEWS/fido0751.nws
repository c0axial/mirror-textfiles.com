     I don't know about you, but I always look forward to seeing
     what's going on in FidoNet land every Monday morning.  The daily
     papers may go unread, but FidoNews is something I almost never
     pass over.  Not because there is always earth-shattering news in
     it, but because if there is some real news in there, I don't
     want to miss it.

     It is because of my diligence of scanning over the Snooze (as it
     is often so affectionately called) that I am prompted to ask,
     "What the heck is going on?"  Say what?  I'm referring to the
     reported zonal unrest, the outcries that Zone 1 is out to rule
     the world, or some such nonsense.  If there is anything that
     gets me riled up at all, it is an article, or a message (usually
     echomail) that is rampant with only half a story.  Please, for
     the sake of good information with which to form an opinion, how
     about putting the FUD factor to rest.  If you're going to call a
     spade a spade, then don't keep me us in the dark, print your
     'facts' to substantiate your assertions.  You will be doing more
     to help everyone grow a little, then just vent your anger and
     help no-one.  You will forgive me for having been conceived and
     raised in Zone 1, my parents never gave me a choice.

     I've never seen anything published in the Snooze, nor put forth
     by the *C' structure, that ever said that people in other zones
     are forbidden from participating in 1) policy decision making,
     2) voting participation, and 3) political representation.

     Every time something or someone makes an attempt to establish
     standards, they are usually shot down in the name of
     'democracy.'  It is not surprising to me to see new proposed
     legislation, policies (call it what you wish), finally come
     around to the point of recognizing that FidoNet is more than
     just Zone 1.  As our hobby progresses, and grows in orders of
     magnitude, I really fail to understand how anyone can think that
     an attempt to set down some guidelines, revise some old ones
     (POLICY4, ECHOPOL) to name two, can be anything bad.  The latest
     policies I've seen do provide for the Zones to carry on their
     business as they see fit, within certain minimal limitations.
     Remember, this includes Zone 1.

     So as for the other Zones.  Please don't feel like you are an
     outsider in all of this, or that you are being excluded.  Your
     ideas are just as important as everyone else's.  Work the
     process through, get something done that we can all live with,
     globally.  Whatever might come out of it, I can promise you that
     it isn't going to please everyone, not the first time around
     anyway.  But then again, that is my whole point, this global
     community we have is evolving.  Lets meld it into something, and
     continue to shape it to (dare I say) perfection.  This is not

     the time to put up walls, it is the time to be taking them down.

                        MED_RAYS Medical Echo

     The MED_RAYS Echo is now available on the backbone.  The TAG for
     this echo is MED_RAYS, and has been developed to enable persons
     working in the Radiology Areas (i.e. X-Ray, Ultrasound, Nuclear
     Medicine and Radiation Therapy) to pass information related to
     new procedures/techniques, medicolegal ethics, etc.  Radiology
     students, professionals, physicians, residents and medical
     students are encouraged to participate.

     Besides offering a means for professionals to exchange ideas
     and new techniques, persons with questions specific to this
     area are also encouraged to participate.  Misinformation
     regarding diagnostic radiation exposure to both X-Radiation
     and Sound Radiation (yes they are both waves, although they
     differ in characteristics) has occurred and will re-occur
     within the electronic media.  The MED_RAYS echo will be an
     alternative source for persons concerned with exposures to
     various diagnostic modalities to gain additional information.

     To date, topics have included establishing an Ultrasound business,
     radiation protection, employment opportunities, cost of living for
     specific areas, Registry information etc.  We look forward to your
     participation in the MED_RAYS area.

     Version 4.00 of my 'eXpress Response System' program has been
     posted and released via the SDS.  This new version will work
     with QuickBBS, RemoteAccess, SuperBBS, TCommNet, Opus, Maximus,
     XBBS and WildCat! (via QuickDoor).

     In keeping with my philosophy of giving the maximum value for
     money, along with version 4.00 I have instituted a new "Family
     Registration Plan".  If you have more than one XRS user in your
     family you may register for the basic $20 for the first person
     plus only $5 for each extra person!

     XRS is Shareware - the "Try before you buy" software.  There is
     absolutely no crippling or missing features, nor does XRS drop
     dead after a certain number of uses or messages written.  The
     $20 fee for SysOp registration is waved if you setup RaQmSeX or
     compatible mailbag creating program like Zip_Mail, XMX or XOR.

     I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone again
     for your help during the Hurricane Hugo disaster - your aid was
     truly appreciated, and I will always remember where my friends
     are!  Thanks again, and hope to see you in Colorodo in August!

     A Sentimental Moment --

     Today was the last day of my contract with one of the larger
     common carriers in the world.  ( Yep, I worked for a local
     phone company. ) I did all the good contractor things this last
     day, you know, backed up the hard disk, borrowed the portable
     for the holidays, made commented directory listings, picked up
     a laser toner cartridge, held information meetings...  all
     those standard last day things.  You'd think a company that
     size wouldn't run out of diskettes.

     It turned out to be a 29 month stay, plenty of time to get to
     know everybody, and everybody's families and it's really hard
     to leave.  But then again, it's really easy to think about what
     I'm going to do next.  So far, I've thought of nothing, and
     that's a pretty fine idea right now.

     So I suppose I'll trot off to Denmark and find Honey and The Kid
     and I'll bet they still love me.  I've already decided that
     Honey's kiss will be proportional to the amount of money she's
     spent.  She'll never figure that one out.

     And I'm gonna get in lots of four year old games before we
     switch to five year old games.

     And I'll wish you and your friends and family the best of times
     this year's end, too.  You, of all people, know that sitting
     here alone in front of the screen, and pressing this ^ key can
     be done with either hand.  Or both.  I think that's about as
     big a holiday message as I can muster.

     Have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
