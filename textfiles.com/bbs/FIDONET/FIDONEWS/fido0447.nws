     =================================================================
                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================

                                My Apologies


     When  I  first heard of IFNA,  it sounded like a good idea.  So I
     put in a lot of effort towards  making  it  work,  and  was  even
     volunteered to help run it until it got off the ground.

     I've since come to realize that I may have made a big mistake.

     I  think I got the first hint at the Colorado Springs conference.
     But at the time I thought it was just that we hadn't done a  good
     job of managing the business meeting.

     Then  we  got  flamed  at  for months and months after that,  all
     through the bylaws and the Board elections.  But at  the  time  I
     thought  it was just that we hadn't done a good job of explaining
     it.

     Then the new Board was seated,  and the flames continued.  But at
     the  time  I  thought  that it was just that several hotheads had
     decided to be unhappy no matter what.

     All of the above  may  even  be  correct.  That's  not  the  real
     problem.  The real problem is that IFNA,  as currently organized,
     seems totally unable to actually accomplish  anything.  That  may
     even be a good thing,  as from what they are talking about we are
     in grave danger that they may actually  figure  out  how  to  get
     things done, because they will then do FAR too much!

     Meanwhile  several of the original objectives remain unfulfilled.
     Almost nobody is covered by the corporate veil and  there  is  no
     legal defense fund, to name just two.

     Beset  from all quarters,  IFNA has been practically emasculated.
     It has only two real assets,  the node list and  the  newsletter.
     But  it's  ownership  of  the  node  list  is virtually nil.  Try
     reading the copyright notices -- IFNA "owns" the node  list  just
     barely  enough  to assemble it each week,  and not one whit more.
     As for owning the newsletter,  enough of a hue and cry  has  been
     raised  over  that  that  nobody  in  their right mind would ever
     consider trying to actually DO anything with it!

     Like do what, you ask?  Like how about an easy way to raise a few
     bucks  for  the  common  good?  We're putting together this stuff
     anyway,  so why not sell it to a few folks if we  can  talk  them
     into  it?  The  node  list  (with  a  little judicious and easily
     automated editing) makes a dandy BBS listing.  And  please  don't
     yell  about how it should never be sold because it belongs to all
     of us.  If it belongs to "all of us" in the  sense  that  it  did
     before IFNA was formed, then anybody who wants to can do anything
     they want with it for free,  so nobody  in  the  net  would  lose
     anything if IFNA sold rights to a few folks.  This is yet another
     FidoNews 4-47                Page 2                   21 Dec 1987


     non-issue.

     In hindsight, I think that the real shortcoming with IFNA is that
     it  has a political structure that does not bear any relationship
     to the actual administrative structure of the network.  Hence  we
     get  into  arguments  over  whether  or not IFNA runs the net and
     similar fog.  Going for non-profit status was probably a mistake,
     because we're then required to organize in a way other  than  how
     we actually run things.

     We also tried to do too much.  For example:

         Why   "International"?   It's   really   a   North   American
         organization with little understanding of the  conditions  in
         other zones.

         Why  worry  about membership discounts?  That should be icing
         on the cake if it happens at all,  NOT the prime  reason  for
         joining!

         Why  worry  about  public  relations?  To try and improve the
         public impression of sysops,  maybe,  but why try to  promote
         the network itself?  One of the current problems is that it's
         getting too big, so why make things worse?

     So back to the title of this editorial.  It seemed  like  a  good
     idea  at  the time,  but so far IFNA isn't turning out very well.
     I'm sorry.

                                 ARTICLES
     =================================================================

     Ryugen Fisher, 220/1

         "The time has come, the walrus said, to speak of many things,
         of shoes and ships and sealing wax, of cabbages and kings..."

     That quote (from Lewis Carroll for those that only saw the movie)
     expresses  the  mood  of  the  moment.  Or to put it another way:
     Friends,  Romans,  Sysops,  lend me your ear.  I come  to  praise
     IFNA, not to bury it.

     Most of you will remember that I am and have been one of the more
     stalwart, if not abusively so, supporters of IFNA. I was privy to
     the  initial discussions regarding forming the organization,  and
     while my memory might be a bit dusty it seems to me that it was I
     who pointed Ken and Ben and Thom in the direction of a  "not-for-
     profit"  corporation  to legitimize and provide structure for the
     then growing (still at it) FidoNet. I was one of the first to pay
     my dues, (I will also pay them again this year for 1988) and when
     I was asked to serve as the chairman  of  the  FidoNet  Technical
     Standards  Committee,  I was glad of the opportunity to serve.  I
     was also proud to be the elected representative for Region 11.  I
     argued long and hard for and spent many a restless night over how
     this network can best serve the community  and  its  users  in  a
     democratic   fashion.   I   was   opposed   to   the  "benevolent
     dictatorship" that was in place and hoped for real  changes  from
     the "new order".

     You will note that I speak in the past tense.  A few weeks ago, a
     fellow  sysop asked me,  "Why are we doing this??" He had been up
     to 4AM in the morning after working all weekend re-formatting his
     hard disk so that his system could  go  back  on  line,  only  to
     receive  as  his  first inbound messages flames from other sysops
     about his not getting the mail out to them on time.  Rather  than
     give  him a snappy and meaningless answer,  I stopped and thought
     about it. I read the Policy3 document, I read the IFNA charter, I
     read the SYSOP and IFNA and IFNABOD and  FTSC  Echo  conferences;
     and  the  more  I  read,  the sadder I became.  I talked to a few
     folks and discovered that many of the  people  I  respected  most
     were  "one  more  flame"  away  from  pulling  the  plug on their
     systems.  So I talked to a few more folks and I came up  with  an
     idea.  Several of them:

      1) The democratic process isn't working...not because the people
         involved  are "bad" or "incapable" but because the thing that
         they are trying to do is essentially undoable and as part  of
         that,  the  MAIN  REASONS for having a net in the first place
         seem to have been  lost,  hopefully  not  forever.  What  are
         those reasons?

         a) To have fun (and it once was fun, remember?)

         b) To  provide  a  public  service  for  the  computer  using
     FidoNews 4-47                Page 4                   21 Dec 1987


            community, including,  programs,  information,  mail and a
            congenial atmosphere.

         c) To  work  with  other  programmers  to create and evolve a
            standard for interfacing these systems.

      2) If I and the other folks that I talked to were to continue in
         active BBS-ing it would be IF and  ONLY  if  it  were  in  an
         environment  where  those  reasons were again paramount,  and
         what's more, were paramount IN THAT ORDER!

      3) That the way it worked BEFORE the "democracy" was better than
         it  is  now,   and  that  there  were  not  nearly  as   much
         recriminations and flames then as there are now,  in SPITE of
         the wonderful work by Don Daniels and  Ken  Kaplan  and  even
         Dave Dodell.

      4) That it was said,  over and over, back in the "old days", "If
         you don't like the way things are  going,  you  are  free  to
         start your own net."

     Well,  I  don't  like  the  way things are going.  I don't like a
     network where the one who makes the first accusation is  the  one
     that is "right",  where people do or don't do things, not because
     of the essential "correctness" of the decision,  but  because  of
     politics,  ego  enrichment  or just not wanting to create another
     round  of  flames.   Where  is  the  politeness,   the   reasoned
     consideration,  the  essential  trust  in our "brother and sister
     sysops" that was ONCE the stock-in-trade  of  our  network?  They
     are  gone,  but they are NOT forgotten and,  while it may well be
     DOOMED from the start,  I believe I owe it to myself and to those
     with  whom  I  once made common cause to try something different.
     Call it a network of "burnouts" or those  that  are  "sadder  and
     wiser"  than before.  I call it "AlterNet" and the SECOND rule is
     that those joining do so KNOWING that flames and politics are NOT
     welcome here.  That there is NO VOTE and NO ELECTIONS,  but there
     is a dedication to serving the community of users and having fun.

     I do not expect that Alternet will be large,  but we DO intend to
     try to interface  with  the  IFNA  network.  We  have  asked  the
     International  Coordinator for one of several means to accomplish
     this, but at the time of this writing,  he has yet to decide upon
     how  he wants to handle this.  Some of the folks in the "big" net
     will be coming over to AlterNet completely,  others will maintain
     a  dual  identity.  Every  effort is being made to see to it that
     AlterNet does NOT interfere with the "big" net,  because none  of
     us wish to be "excessively annoying." I will be sending notice to
     the  IFNA  Board of Directors that I will be resigning my seat in
     favor of my alternate, Bill Allbritten, whom I believe will serve
     well and honestly.  I do not plan to resign as  Chairman  of  the
     FTSC  because  that  position does not require IFNA membership or
     BOD membership and I  believe  that  my  continued  participation
     there  may  help  BOTH  networks.  Of  course,  I may get "fired"
     because not everyone will think that what I am doing is honorable
     or correct. For that I must apologize in advance.

     FidoNews 4-47                Page 5                   21 Dec 1987


     It is not a decision that comes lightly, nor without some doubts.
     What is NOT in doubt is that something needs  to  change  or  the
     network will not survive the coming years. I do not think of this
     action  as  abandoning  the  net,   but  as  providing  a  viable
     alternative WITHIN the "greater net" for those  who  want  to  do
     something different.  For the first time, there will be a choice.
     And I,  for one,  hope that all of us are mature enough as people
     and that the net is mature  enough  as  an  entity  that  we  can
     respect the idea that there needs to BE a choice.

     My sincere wishes for the best of the Holiday Season to you, your
     families and your users.

     Several  people  have become dissatisfied with the conditions now
     prevailing in FidoNet,  and have decided to strike out on our own
     and  form  a  new  network  in which the original goals of mutual
     defense, the free flow of information,  and service to the public
     can  once  again  flourish.  The following is the present working
     draft of what will be  our  primary  governing  document.  It  is
     presented here for your amusement and edification.

              --- Ryugen Fisher, Lord Frog of the Northern Marshes




                             The Code of Honor

                                    for

                       Chivalry in the Electronic Age



                                INTRODUCTION

     In this modern age of electronic communications, there has arisen
     a hearty band of volunteers dedicated to  the  principle  of  the
     free exchange of information.  Not merely for themselves, but for
     all  those  around  them  as  well.  This  group  is known as the
     Intergalactic Sysop Alliance,  and to further  their  goals  they
     have  established  the  Alliance  Local  Telephone Exchange Relay
     Network, also known as AlterNet.

     The purpose of this document is to describe the Alliance and  the
     network they operate, and to establish the principles under which
     they are managed.



     Glossary of terms

     Following  are  the  terms  used in this document to describe the
     Alliance and its operations:

     Alliance
         The Intergalactic Sysop Alliance.

     AlterNet
         The Alliance Local Telephone Exchange Relay Network, which is
         the free public mail network operated by  the  Alliance,  and
         its primary purpose for existing.

     Commoner
         Anyone who is not a member of the Alliance,  but who benefits
         by its activities.  The Alliance operates  AlterNet  for  the
         purpose  of  supplying  free communication to commoners.  All
         other goals are secondary to this.

     FidoNews 4-47                Page 7                   21 Dec 1987


     Knight
         Any member of the Alliance, in any capacity.

     Noble
         A  member  of  the  Alliance  who  has   undertaken   certain
         administrative  tasks  related to coordinating the actions of
         Knights.  The various ranks of nobles and their  duties  will
         be described later.

     Lord
         A  Noble  who directly coordinates the actions of Knights and
         other Nobles.  Specifically,  every  Knight  serves  under  a
         Noble  who  is  his Lord.  Lords are distinguished from other
         Nobles in that only they may grant Knighthood.


     These terms are basic to an understanding of the Alliance.  Other
     terms are used as well, and will be defined in context.


                                 KNIGHTHOOD

     It is the responsibility of  every  Knight  to  operate  his  own
     system  in accordance with the technical requirements of AlterNet
     and with the Code of Honor of the Knights of  the  Alliance.  The
     Code  of Honor is a living tradition of the Alliance.  This means
     that you are not expected to follow a rote set of  procedures  as
     such,  but  to live and act in the grand tradition of your fellow
     Knights.  But some of the more salient points can be summed up as
     follows:

      o  A Knight exists to serve the commoners, using AlterNet as his
         means.  Usually this means running a public  access  bulletin
         board  that  provides  free  electronic  communication to the
         community.  It could also mean supporting your fellow knights
         in the furthurance of the operation of their bulletin boards.
         For example,  you might help to coordinate the activities  of
         your  fellow  knights,  or  you  might  procure or distribute
         conferences for your fellow knights to post on their bulletin
         boards.

         But service to the public is the key.  A Knight who does  not
         directly serve the public,  or who does not assist his fellow
         Knights in serving the public,  is assumed to be awaiting the
         proper  chance  to do so.  But a Knight who refuses to assist
         in this prime goal of the Alliance is without Honor.

      o  A Knight should be tolerant of his fellow Knights, willing to
         overlook occasional lapses from grace in the  furtherance  of
         our prime goal.

      o  A  Knight  should  be  helpful  to  fellow  Knights  in need,
         assisting them when they falter or are troubled.

      o  A Knight should be soft spoken.  It is unseemly for a  Knight
         to engage in public displays of temper or ill will.
     FidoNews 4-47                Page 8                   21 Dec 1987


      o  A Knight should at all times observe the Laws of the Land, as
         established  by  such  mundane  authorities  as may exist.  A
         Knight who knowingly engages in illegal  activities,  or  who
         supports others in doing so,  is without Honor and a disgrace
         to the Alliance.

      o  A Knight should endeavour to stay current on all tithes.

      o  A Knight should avoid acting in such a way  as  to  interfere
         with another Knight in the performance of his duties.

      o  A  Knight  must always observe National Mail Hour and keep it
         Holy,  banning all commoners  from  his  system  during  this
         period.  In  a  Fief,  the  local  Count  or Baron may decree
         additional mail periods, which must also be honored.  Failure
         to do so is sufficient grounds for immediate  excommunication
         without  warning,  as  warning  is  normally given by network
         mail.

      o  A Knight must always use the most  recent  node  list  as  is
         practical,  lest  an out of date node list cause him to annoy
         commonors by dialing wrong numbers.


     A Knight which has been dropped from the network is  said  to  be
     excommunicated  (i.e.  unable  to  communicate).  The most common
     cause of excommunication is failure to honor National Mail  Hour.
     If  you  find  that you have been excommunicated without warning,
     then that means that your Noble was unable to  contact  you.  You
     should rectify the problem and report back.

     National  Mail  Hour is observed from 0900 to 1000 GMT every day,
     weekends included.  In each of the United States time zones, this
     would be as follows:

         Eastern Standard Time         4 AM to 5 AM
         Central Standard Time         3 AM to 4 AM
         Mountain Standard Time        2 AM to 3 AM
         Pacific Standard Time         1 AM to 2 AM
         Hawaii Standard Time         11 PM to Midnight

     AlterNet does not observe daylight savings time.  In areas  which
     observe daylight savings time the AlterNet mail schedules must be
     adjusted   in   the   same   direction   as   the  clock  change.
     Alternatively, you can simply leave your system on standard time.



     How to become a Knight

     All Knights are identified by their AlterNet address.  To  become
     a Knight,  you must get your system operating properly,  and then
     request a network address from your local Lord.

     You must first obtain a current node list so that  you  can  send
     mail.  You do not need an AlterNet address to send mail,  but you
     FidoNews 4-47                Page 9                   21 Dec 1987


     must have one in order for others to send mail to you.

     The first step in obtaining a current node list is to  locate  an
     AlterNet bulletin board.  No help there; you're on your own.  But
     you  might  try looking on the system you got this document from.
     If the Knight of any AlterNet system does not have  a  node  list
     available for downloading, then he can probably tell you where to
     get one.

     Once you have a node list, you must determine which Lord to apply
     to.  Counts and Dukes are always "node zero" of their domain, and
     Barons  are  always indicated by a "HUB" prefix in the node list.
     The Lord you should apply to is the one with the smallest  domain
     that  includes  your  location.  For example,  if you are located
     within a local fief,  then you would apply to the Count  of  that
     fief.  If there is no fief in your area,  then you would apply to
     the nearest Duke.  All of AlterNet is divided into  dukedoms,  so
     you will always have a Duke even if you are not in a fief.

     Your  application  for  knighthood  must  be sent to the Noble by
     AlterNet mail, and must include at least the following:

         1) Your name.
         2) The name of your system.
         3) The city and state where your system is located.
         4) The phone number to be used when calling your system.
         5) Your hours of operation.
         6) The maximum baud rate you can support.
         7) A telephone number at which you can be reached by voice.


     Your Lord  may  want  additional  information.  If  so,  he  will
     contact  you.  Please  allow  at  least  two to three weeks for a
     knighthood request to be processed.

     Note that Knighthood is an honor,  not a right.  It will be up to
     your Lord to decide if you are ready to be dubbed a Knight of the
     Alliance.


     If you are going down

     If  your  system will be down for an extended period (more than a
     day or two),  then  you  should  inform  your  Lord  as  soon  as
     possible.  If  you do not do this,  then other Knights will still
     try to reach you while you are down,  much to  the  annoyance  of
     everyone.  Do  not  under  any  circumstances  put  an  answering
     machine or similar device on your phone line while you are  down.
     If you do,  then calling systems will get the machine repeatedly,
     racking up large phone bills, which is very annoying.

     If you will be leaving your system  unattended  for  an  extended
     period  of  time (such as while you are on vacation),  you should
     notify your Lord.  Systems do have a tendency to "crash" now  and
     then,  so  you  will probably want your Lord to know that it is a
     temporary condition if it happens while you are away.

     How to form a fief

     If there are several Knights in your area,  but no  local  Count,
     then  you  may  wish  to  form  your  own  fief.  You may also be
     requested to form a fief by your Duke.

     Your first step is to contact the other  Knights  in  your  area.
     You  must decide which Knights will comprise the fief,  and which
     of those Knights is going to be your local Count.  Your next step
     is to contact your Duke to request the granting of a  fief.  With
     the  request  you must include a copy of the proposed fief's node
     list.

     Granting of a fief is not automatic.  Your Duke will review  your
     application  and  inform  you  of  his  decision.  Do not request
     anyone other than your Duke to grant you a fief.


                                  NOBILITY

     The Nobility consists of all those Knights who  have  volunteered
     to  help  coordinate  the  actions  of their fellow knights.  All
     Nobles serve at the pleasure of their superiors.

     Certain Nobles are styled Lords,  because they coordinate network
     activities  over  a  geographic area which is their Domain.  This
     includes maintaining that portion of the node list  which  covers
     his  domain,  and  assisting  in the distribution of the AlterNet
     node  list  and  the  Alliance  newsletter.   A  Lord   is   also
     responsible for establishing such local policy as may be required
     within his domain,  so long as that policy does not conflict with
     this document or with the policy established by a superior Lord.

     There are the following types of Lords within the Alliance:

     The Archduke
         His Majesty the Archduke is the supreme authority within  the
         Alliance.  He  has,  as  is  main  concern,  the  day  to day
         operation of AlterNet  and  the  weekly  publication  of  the
         AlterNet  node list.  He also acts as chief spokesman for the
         Alliance.

     The Viceroys
         His Majesty is assisted by two Viceroys,  the Junior  Viceroy
         and  the  Senior  Viceroy.  Together,  all three comprise the
         Ruling Troika,  which is the supreme decision making body  of
         the Alliance.

     The Dukes
         AlterNet  is  divided  into  ten  dukedoms,  each of which is
         presided over by a Duke.  There is  no  location  within  the
         Alliance that is not within the domain of some Duke.

         The  ten  Dukes together comprise the Council of Dukes.  This
         council is charged with establishing  long  range  goals  and
         plans,  and  with  appointing  Knights  to the Ruling Troika.
     FidoNews 4-47                Page 11                  21 Dec 1987


         Every six months the Council of  Dukes  must  appoint  a  new
         Junior  Viceroy.  At  this time the preceeding Junior Viceroy
         becomes Senior Viceroy, the preceeding Senior Viceroy becomes
         Archduke, and the preceeding Archduke retires.

         The Council of Dukes also sets the tithes for Knighthood.  It
         is understood that the tithes are to be  used  primarily  for
         establishing  and  maintaining  a  legal defense fund to help
         defend Knights in any conflicts that may arise  with  mundane
         authorities related to the pursuit of a Knight's mission.  In
         any event,  the annual budget must be approved by the Council
         of Dukes.

     The Counts
         Where several Knights  reside  within  a  reasonably  compact
         geographic  area,  the  local  Duke may grant a Fief to those
         Knights.  The fief is then presided over by a Count,  who  is
         then  responsible  for  its smooth operation.  In addition to
         such other duties as all Nobles must share,  a Count is  also
         responsible  for  receiving  mail destined for Knights within
         his fief and for seeing that it is  properly  routed  to  its
         destination.

         A  Count  may  wish  to  provide outbound mail service to his
         Knights as well.  This is not  required,  but  is  considered
         highly  desireable.  It  is  acknowledged  that the Count may
         need to seek outside sponsorship in this endeavour or to  lay
         and  collect local taxes.  But in no case shall a Count claim
         to provide outbound mail service to his Knights unless it can
         be accomplished in a timely, reliable manner.

         It would be dishonorable for  a  Count  to  trespass  on  the
         territory  of another Count,  or on the territory of any Duke
         other than his own.  Any special cases which may  arise  must
         be settled by a treaty negotiated between the affected Counts
         and ratified by the Dukes concerned.

     The Barons
         In  a  large  fief the local Count may wish to appoint one or
         more Barons to assist him.  Each Baron will then be  assigned
         a  geographic  area  to  preside  over,  and will perform the
         duties required of the Count for  those  Knights  within  his
         domain.

     The primary responsibility of any Lord is technical management of
     network   operations.   Decisions  should  be  made  strictly  on
     technical grounds as far as possible.

     In addition to the Lords, there exist these other Nobles:

     The Grand Wizard
         The Grand Wizard is appointed by the Council of Dukes to  act
         as  the final arbiter of technical issues relating to network
         operations.  The Grand Wizard may  then  in  turn  appoint  a
         Council of Wizards to act as his advisors and assistants.

     FidoNews 4-47                Page 12                  21 Dec 1987


         In  no  case  may  a developer of AlterNet compatible network
         mail software be appointed as Grand Wizard.  If the  existing
         Grand  Wizard  should  descend to such ignomy,  then he shall
         immediately forfeit his position.

     The Rumor Monger
         The Rumor Monger is not exactly a Noble,  being engaged in  a
         trade  that  is  ignoble  by definition.  The Rumor Monger is
         appointed by the Council of Dukes to assemble and publish the
         Alliance newsletter, which shall be known as AlterNews.

     One of the duties of any  Noble  is  to,  as  soon  as  possible,
     appoint  a  successor.  He  must  then inform his superior of his
     selection so that his choice may be confirmed.  If a Noble leaves
     his post for any reason,  his successor immediately steps in.  If
     a  Noble  leaves  his post without having an acceptible successor
     appointed,  then it will be up  to  his  superior  to  appoint  a
     successor.

     Gene Coppola 107/246

                                    QT/2
                        A New Computer at a Low Cost


         Recently I went to a local computer show run by  Ken  Gordon.
     The  show was in Hempstead,  New York at one of the local hotels.
     If you remember,  I had sent in an article to Fidonews that a new
     PS/2 clone would be released at that particular computer show.

         Well, after much examination and testing, I can now report on
     the QT/2-6 computer, which I purchased 2 days after the show. The
     QT/2-6 is a PS/60 clone. The machine is enclosed in a metal case,
     that opens very easily. It is about the size of a standard IBM PC
     type computer. A key lock is provided on the front of the case to
     lock the keyboard in the on or off position. An led for power and
     hard drive access are visible on the front of the case.

         Opening  the case reveals a carefully thought out motherboard
     with no apparent last minute jumpers soldered in or  traces  cut.
     The power supply is a hefty 350 watts and has two very quiet fans
     for ample cooling.

         On  the  motherboard there are a total of eight (8) expansion
     slots.  Six slots are PS/2 MCA compatible and two slots  are  for
     PC/XT expansion boards.  Eight expansion slots did not seem to be
     very generous.  Then I realized that the serial, parallel, floppy
     disk  controller  and  CGA/EGA/VGA  functions  are built into the
     motherboard.

         No expansion slot is taken for additional memory either.  The
     motherboard  comes  populated  with twelve Megabytes of 60ns Ram.
     You can divide the Ram  in  various  ways  to  suit  your  needs.
     Depending  upon  your  start  up  configuration,  the  Ram can be
     divided into Extended, Expanded, or a combination of both.

         The QT/2-6 uses an 80386 is the main processor.  An 80387 NDP
     comes with the system. The clock is speed is 20Mhz.

         Under  PC-DOS  3.3 the system performed very well.  All major
     software (Lotus,  dBase  III+,  Paradox,  Wordstar,  Professional
     Write,  Flight  Simulator,  SEAdog,  QBBS) loaded and ran with no
     problems.  I have not been able to find any software  that  would
     not run.

         OS/2 was a different story however. I chalk up the problems I
     encountered to the fact that OS/2 is not yet the polished product
     it  should  be.  All  programs  loaded  but  several  encountered
     problems during  operation.  Using  the  compatibility  box  made
     things  easier,  however  if one program crashed,  then the whole
     system would hang.

         The designers of the QT/2 are to be commended  for  the  time
     and  detail  that  went  into the Rom chip set they developed for
     this machine. I might be wrong, but this is the only machine that
     FidoNews 4-47                Page 14                  21 Dec 1987


     I am aware of,  that will run PC-DOS 3.3 and still allow you  all
     the features that a PS/2 type computer needs OS/2 to access.

         Several  different  MCA  boards were loaned to me for testing
     purposes and they performed as advertised,  with no  problems  to
     report.

         The machine comes with two 360k floppy disk drives, and one 3
     1/2  inch  disk  drive.  All  the drives were made by Toshiba and
     perform quite well.  The QT/2 recognizes which  format  (720k  or
     1.2Mb)  is  in  the  3  1/2  inch drive and reads and writes both
     formats with no problems.

         I installed my Seagate ST-251 hard drive and was relieved  to
     see  that  I  did  not  have to use Disk Manager to partition the
     drive.  So I now have a 42 Mb drive instead of two 21 Mb  logical
     drives.  This  allows the ST-251 to perform at its rated speed of
     21ms instead of 80ms under Disk Manager.

         I now run my bulletin board (QBBS EAST) on this  machine  and
     have  no  problems.  SEAdog  runs as a front end for QuickBBS and
     performs as expected.

         All in all I would say the QT/2-6 is a fine machine  for  the
     money.  The  base  price  for  the  machine  is  only $2450 which
     includes everything mentioned above except the hard drive.

     Robert Heller @ 1:321/148

     I am interested in setting up a new EchoMail conference on the
     subject of generic 680x0-based systems.  I am one of those people
     who has an "oddball" computer system:  a Stride 440 (10Mhz 68000
     CPU), running CP/M-68K.  It is not one of the "common" 68K
     systems (Mac, Atari ST, or Amiga).  Are there other people like
     me out there in FidoNet land?  If you are interested in carrying
     a generic 680x0 conference send me netmail.  Also, I would be
     interested in the posibility of gatewaying such a conference with
     the comp.sys.m68k* newsgroups (aka Info-68K@ucbvax.berkeley.edu
     on ARPANet).  My home machine is not on USENET (does not run UNIX
     or any sort of uucp clone), so I can't do the gatewaying on my
     machine.  Oh, I'd like to name this proposed EchoMail conference
     INFO_68K.

     To run KXP1092 is very simple. Just unarc the file and type
     the following command:

                          KXP1092 /p

     The /p designates the port the printer is connected to. Valid
     numbers are from 1 to 3. If you desire you may leave off the /p
     and the program will default to port 1.

     KXP1092 allows you to set many of the features that are available
     and gives you an immediate printed confirmation of the results.

     EGA and CGA modes are supported in this version. You must have a
     printer connected and turned on or the program will remind you
     to do so.

          In an effort to ascertain how many people really
     read Fidonews, I would like to propose a little
     experiment.

          If everyone who reads this article would send me a
     postcard, with their, city, state, and country written on
     it, I will be happy to tabulate the results and report
     them in a future issue.

          It might be very interesting to see the results from
     this little experiment. Some people claim "No One Reads
     Fidonews", (God forbid) and some people have claimed a
     readership of 6 million people.

          Well, if you are willing to take the time to send me
     a postcard, I will take the time to keep track of the
     results, even if I get 6 million postcards.

          I will collect postcards for this experiment from
     the day this article is published, until January 31,
     1988.  This will give everyone a month to reply.

     Kilgore Trout, 1:107/6


                          What's Happening at SEA?

     We've been making some changes to XlatList and  RouteGen,  mainly
     to  support  the proposed node list changes,  but also to improve
     international mail and to add a few generally desired features.

     First, in XlatList:

      o  There has been some confusion over just what kind  of  output
         XlatList  should  generate  in  OPUS  mode.   In  particular,
         version 2.84  added  the  node  list  comment  flags  to  the
         NODELIST.BBS  file,  but the Opus node list compiler couldn't
         handle it.  But now we're told that Opus will soon  have  its
         own  node  list  translator,  so  XlatList's  OPUS  mode  now
         produces the older style output like Fido 11w expects.

      o  It is now possible to set a maximum baud rate based  on  node
         list  flags.  This is done with the MAXBAUD statement,  which
         can now look something like this:

              maxbaud 2400 PEP 9600

         This means set a max baud rate  of  2400  baud,  except  that
         entries with the string "PEP" in the comments field can go to
         9600 baud.

      o  It is now much easier to refer to overseas nets.  Previously,
         you  had  to  maintain  your  own  private  node list for the
         overseas nodes you wanted to call.  Now you can have XlatList
         automate that for you.

         For example,  supposed you wish to exchange files with  nodes
         in  net 630 of zone 3.  In your XLATLIST.CTL file you can now
         have the statement:

              ozone 3:630

         This tells XlatList to pull in net 630 of zone 3 as a private
         net in your own node list.

         But remember that net  numbers  might  be  duplicated  across
         zones.  There  might  already  be a net 630 in your own zone.
         In this case, you'd have to use a private net number.  If you
         wanted to use private  net  number  1999,  then  the  correct
         statement would be:

              ozone 3:630 1999

         This  would  case,  for example,  node 3:630/613 to appear in
         your own node list as node 1999/613 in your own zone.

         Is this confusing enough yet?  Unless you want to send  files
         or crash mail to nodes in another zone, don't worry about it.
     FidoNews 4-47                Page 19                  21 Dec 1987


         For  normal  netmail  just  go  on as before and let the zone
         gates handle it.

      o  It is now possible to pull in  point  net  gateway  listings.
         This would be helpful for some net outbound gates,  but again
         few people need to bother with it.

      o  XlatList can now be told to automatically clean up  its  work
         area.  Ever  notice  how  old  node  lists  seem  to build up
         forever?   Now  if  you  put  a  CLEANUP  statement  in  your
         XLATLIST.CTL   file,   XlatList   will  automatically  delete
         difference files as they are applied,  and  delete  old  node
         lists as new ones are generated.


     And now, in RouteGen:

      o  We've added an OPUS mode that should be  useful  in  creating
         Opus routing control files.

      o  We've  added a new conditional,  "FLAG",  to test if your own
         node list entry has a given comment flag.  A possible use for
         this might be:

              if flag XP
                   Give-to ALL
                   Pickup ALL
              endif

         This would probably  be  most  useful  for  network  "routing
         mavens"  who  maintain  a master ROUTEGEN.CTL file for use by
         all nodes in a given network.

      o  We've added quoted literals.  Literals are not  evaluated  by
         RouteGen, but are passed through unchanged.  For example, you
         could say:

              Send-to 107/312 "Bill Bertholf" 107/16

         We're not quite sure what good this is, but it's there if you
         need it.

      o  We've  added a new macro for address aliasing.  This keys off
         of the "AKA:" node  list  flag.  For  example,  suppose  that
         107/300 has a comment flag of "AKA:312".  You could then say:

              Send-to aka-107/300

         and RouteGen would change it to:

              Send-to 107/312

         This is especially useful for holding mail for  pickup  by  a
         hub,  since  the hub will be calling under his "real" address
         instead of his hub address.

          I am in need of a node in each of the following regions to
     serve as a distribution point for that region for neww sofftware
     coming out for use in Fidonet.

          What I would like is prefferably a node that is able to be
     called via PC Pursuit <tm> and allows access to the file areas
     for new or un-registered callers. They should also have a high
     speed modem although this is not really necessary. These nodes
     (once they are all set up will become part of the distribution
     chain, in that they may designate other nodes within their
     regions to act as "local distribution nodes". Only one node from
     each region is able to be listed in Zone 1 so I will take the
     best qualified node (based on system size, accessibility, modem
     speed, and whether they are PCPable or not) from each region. The
     node should also be a low traffic node, since we want to make it
     as easy as possible for callers to gain access to the system
     without running up against a busy signal too much.

          If you are interested please send me a note via netmail with
     a phone number where you can be reached during the evenings
     (voice).

          I need nodes in the following regions:

                                                Region 10
                                                Region 12
                                                Region 14
                                                Region 15

          I would also like to here from you if you wish to possibly
     become one of the local distribution nodes within ANY region. I
     will put you in contact with the region distribution node for
     your region.

     Last week, some of our student consultants discovered
     a virus program that's been spreading rapidly throughout
     Lehigh University. I thought I'd take a few minutes and
     warn as many of you as possible about this program since
     it has the chance of spreading much farther than just
     our University.  We have no idea where the virus
     started, but some users have told me that other
     universities have recently had similar problems.

     The virus: the virus itself is contained in the stack
     space of COMMAND.COM. When a pc is booted from an
     infected disk, all a user need do to spread the virus
     is to access another disk via TYPE, COPY, DIR, etc. If
     the other disk contains COMMAND.COM, the virus code is
     copied to the other disk. Then, a counter is incremented
     on the parent.

     When this counter reaches a value of 4, any and every
     disk in the PC is erased thoroughly. The boot tracks are
     nulled, as are the FAT tables, etc.  All Norton's
     horses couldn't put it back together again... This
     affects both floppy and hard disks.  Meanwhile, the four
     children that were created go on to tell four friends,
     and then they tell four friends, and so on, and so on.

     Detection: while this virus appears to be very well
     written, the author did leave behind a couple
     footprints. First, the write date of the command.com
     changes. Second, if there's a write protect tab on an
     uninfected disk, you will get a WRITE PROTECT ERROR...

     So, boot up from a suspected virus'd disk and access a
     write protected disk - if an error comes up, then you're
     sure.  Note that the length of command.com does not get
     altered.

     I urge anyone who comes in contact with publicly
     accessible (sp?) disks to periodically check their own
     disks. Also, exercise safe computing - always wear a
     write protect tab.

     This is not a joke.  A large percentage of our public
     site disks has been infected by this virus in the last
     couple of days.

     BEWARE - I SPEAK FROM EXPERIENCE...NOT EVEN MACE CAN
     RECOVER THIS ONE. HE WENT AFTER ALL THE MACE FILES AS
     WELL. THEY ARE COMPLETELY OVERWRITTEN MAKING THEM
     USELESS FOR RECOVERY PURPOSES !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

          I'm still  trying to get things back on an even keel so this
     may go out a week late, ruining my two week prefect record. Maybe
     after  this  holiday  season  is  over things will get better, at
     least I don't see how they could get any worse. For those  of you
     who  enjoy   my  pseudo-reviews,   I've  got  some  bad  news.  I
     unfortunately feel the need to do some editorializing  on some of
     the  recent  events  and  trends  I've  noticed. So if you aren't
     interested in my viewpoint, drop down to the winding down section
     where  I  look  at  a  recent  improvement  in one of my favorite
     utilities.

     -- FidoNet, IFNA and other random thoughts --

          It seems old habits are hard to break.  After several months
     of  seeing  people  actually  work together, everyone seems to be
     trying to break the net apart again. Some of this is probably due
     to  the  severe  growing  pains  the net is going through. When I
     first joined FidoNet 2  years ago,  I kept  a close  watch on the
     size of  the nodelist. I watched the number of nodes very closely
     until it stabilized at  over 1,000  nodes, and  we now  have over
     2,100  nodes!  This  type  of  expansion in such a short time has
     created its share of problems. Not only does the net have to deal
     with  several   hundred  neophyte   sysops,  but  there  are  the
     operational difficulties as well.

          A good example of  operational  difficulties  are  zones and
     their  gateways.  Only  recently  has the number of international
     nodes (Overseas sysops please excuse me as I  write with  a North
     America  bias)  become  such  a significant part of the nodelist.
     When  the  zone  based   nodelist  was   introduced  many  people
     complained at  the switch  and how  they weren't prepared for it.
     This was despite the fact the it had been announced several weeks
     earlier. I don't know how many times I read about how this showed
     IFNA trying to take control of the net.  IFNA wasn't  (and isn't)
     trying to  take control  of the net, it was merely trying to make
     it easier to manage and use. The complications  involved with the
     non-zone based nodelist were becoming unmanageable to many people
     and there was software that could  handle a  zone based nodelist.
     With the gateways in place, it even helps cut down on the cost of
     overseas netmail. While zones will help out everyone  in the long
     run, it  can make  it difficult  in the  short run while everyone
     learns how to use zones and their gateways.

          Educating new sysops and users is another task that needs to
     be done.  Many of these new sysops (and their board's users) have
     never heard of Echomail,  and many  don't seem  to be  aware that
     every  message  entered  is  echoed  across the world and to many
     FidoNews 4-47                Page 27                  21 Dec 1987


     different types  of bulletin  boards. When  the echomail programs
     are properly  set up,  a message should never go out addressed to
     "Sysop." Despite this, I've seen dozens of such messages over the
     past few  weeks. This  is a  matter where the network has to help
     educate new sysops.  All  sysops  in  turn  should  work  to help
     educate their  users. What  should they  be "teaching?" How about
     posting messages in  a  relevant  area,  especially  in echomail.
     Telling someone  that the file they're interested in is available
     by downloading it from this board doesn't help anyone. The person
     looking for it could very easily be across the country. Right now
     I don't even feel  like going  into the  number of  messages that
     have no  purpose being  in an echomail area ("Are you going to be
     home Friday night Joe?"). When events like this  occur regularly,
     it only  serves to give FidoNet a bad impression. IFNA is a group
     that could do a lot in this area.  Not by  controlling new nodes,
     but  by  helping  to  educate  new  sysops  and  users.  The file
     NEWSYSOP.ARC (available by SEAdog  file request  from 157/1 among
     others) is  a good example of how this could be done. It attempts
     to explain many of things we old hands take for  granted. What is
     echomail? What  software can I run? How do I apply for a net/node
     number? Why are there zones,  regions,  nets,  etc.  and  what is
     routing? These are all things a new sysop needs to know, and IFNA
     is working to help these people out.

          Another problem in FidoNet today is that many people seem to
     be trying  to tear  the net  apart. The first of these symptoms I
     noticed was that no one  was  a  FidoNet  sysop,  they  were Fido
     sysops, or  Opus sysops or SEAdog users. Up until a year ago, the
     only software available  was Fido  and SEAdog.  While many  of us
     used SEAdog  as a  front-end, we  still associated ourselves with
     FidoNet. Now if you ask someone what type of BBS  they're running
     they  won't  say  they're  a FidoNet sysop, instead they'll first
     identify themselves as an Opus, Fido,  TBBS, etc.  sysop. This is
     also beginning  to show  itself in the newsletters circulating or
     starting up. In the past FidoNews was one of the  few things that
     linked  us  together  (along  with the nodelist and National Mail
     Hour). Since echomail hadn't really started  up, many  of us knew
     almost nothing  about anyone in FidoNet. FidoNews gave us a sense
     being part of a community. While echomail does some of  this, the
     feeling  of   camaraderie  isn't   there.  With   the  influx  of
     newsletters, no one realizes how much we need to work together to
     stay together. Instead of everyone contributing to one newsletter
     that  contains  information  for  everyone  in  FidoNet, everyone
     suddenly  seems   to  want   a  newsletter   that  only  contains
     information that pertains to them.  While  this  may  sound nice,
     think about  how much  it can  fragment FidoNet before you get so
     gung ho on the idea. If  you aren't  willing to  communicate with
     other sysops,  why did you join FidoNet in the first place? Also,
     if  you  aren't  willing  to  keep  an  open  mind,  how  can you
     communicate?

          Software    incompatibilities    are    another   cause   of
     fragmentation within FidoNet. Part of this is also  caused by the
     influx of  new software  in the  net. When everyone was using the
     same software,  there was  no chance  for incompatibilities. Now,
     many of  the network  mailers are  putting in  their own advanced

     features before they are compatible with the software that is out
     there and has been out there for some time. This standard I refer
     to has been documented for  over  a  year  in  the  FTSC (FidoNet
     Technical  Standards   Committee)  documents.   While  I  haven't
     obtained a new set of  documents  recently,  I  hope  they aren't
     trying to  keep the  documents up to date with every new piece of
     software. This could quickly turn a hard to  accomplish task into
     an impossible  one. I'm not saying that I'm against new features,
     I just think that new software should be compatible with  the old
     software as  well. SEAdog  was an  excellent example  of how this
     should be done. System  Enhancement  Associates  has  always done
     everything  possible  to  be  compatible  with  existing software
     BEFORE expanding  on it.  While there  were a  few problems, they
     were fixed  as quickly as possible. Some of them were even due to
     documentation being incorrect or  incomplete in  some ways. While
     some  of   the  new   network  mailers   are  having  these  same
     difficulties, some seem determined  to see  how far  they can get
     from these  established standards.  This again  is something that
     could quickly destroy FidoNet and all that goes along with it.

          Many of you may take all  this to  mean that  I am pro-IFNA.
     Well, I'm  not. I  am however, pro-FidoNet. IFNA is not trying to
     control FidoNet, it's merely  an  organization  trying  to assure
     everyone that FidoNet will be here tomorrow. If some of you think
     that certain  IFNA positions  have a  great deal  of power inside
     FidoNet, they  do. However,  in the  past some individual has had
     the same power and  with no  way of  replacing them  if something
     happened or  they abused their power. The International Technical
     Coordinator is such a position. In the past  Ben Baker  saw to it
     that a  nodelist (and nodediff) was published every week (he took
     over the  job from  Tom Jennings).  In spite  of quite  a deal of
     trouble,  Ben  always  got  it  out. When he was hospitalized for
     surgery, the nodelist still  went out.  For many  years, he would
     correct many  mistakes in  the nodelist submissions. If something
     had happened to Ben, the net  would have  fallen apart  in weeks.
     IFNA assures  us that this can never happen. There will always be
     someone  to  handle  this  job,  as  recently  happened  when Ben
     resigned from this position. I believe that these choices will be
     good, honest people like Ben.  There  will  not  be  any childish
     behavior tolerated by IFNA. Things like leaving people out of the
     nodelist for personal reasons would only result in IFNA finding a
     new coordinator.  This brings stability to FidoNet, and stability
     helps everyone in the long run.

          One item that I find particularly distressing is  the rumors
     that  only  IFNA  members  will  be listed in future nodelists. I
     thought the net was  past this  nonsense already.  You will NEVER
     have to  join or  pay IFNA anything to be listed in the nodelist.
     All you will have  to  do  is  abide  by  the  POLICYx.DOC, which
     basically  means   don't  be  excessively  annoying  and  observe
     National Mail Hour. IFNA is not trying to  become FidoNet,  it is
     merely  trying  to  assure  that  FidoNet  continues to exist. If
     another organization appears in the future with this same goal, I
     will support it as much as I support IFNA. If we keep on going on
     the present track, we're going to end up destroying the  net that
     so many  of us  enjoy. We have to learn to work together, or else

     we shall surely be torn apart.

          After the Alexandria FidoCon, I thought  things were finally
     going to  start working  out. For  awhile this  was true, but old
     habits seem hard to break. Many of us have already  forgotten the
     spirit that  pervaded FidoCon,  one of  everyone working together
     for the good of FidoNet. I'd  like to  propose the  idea of mini-
     FidoCons to  help keep  this spirit alive. If you'd be interested
     in one of these mini-cons, drop me a line. If  there really seems
     to be  the interest,  maybe we'll  try one out over a weekend. In
     the meantime, let's try and work together a little.

     -- Winding down... --

          I got an "update" to an  old favorite  this past  week. Ever
     since I  came across  Xtree I've found it to be a useful program.
     As the number of echomail conferences increased, I  began to find
     it less  and less  useful. The  original Xtree  could only handle
     about 2,200 files, and with each message being  a file  it didn't
     take long  to reach Xtree's limits. Xtree Pro (Executive Systems,
     list $129.00)  solves  many  of  the  shortcomings  of  Xtree. It
     demolishes the  old file  limit (The default file limit is 18,000
     files and can be increased!). Since many of us have more than one
     logical  drive,  Xtree  Pro  allows  you  to  log  up  to sixteen
     different drives. This should hold even a backbone  echomail node
     for a  few weeks  and it  can always be increased. In addition it
     allows for multiple file  specs. It's  easy to  see all  the BAT,
     EXE, and  COM files  on all your drives. Another handy feature of
     this is that you can check  for file  duplications across several
     drives.  If  this  wasn't  enough,  they've  put in a small ASCII
     editor. I've been using  Xtree Pro  to handle  my directories for
     echomail. Not only can I create the directories I need, but I can
     edit the areas.bbs and configuration  files  as  well.  Xtree Pro
     also has  the option  for quick  disk logging.  While it isn't as
     fast as some of  the other  file managers,  it also  doesn't keep
     track of  everything in  a file.  Xtree Pro actually looks at the
     disk every time you start it up. While I was  pleased with Xtree,
     I am even more pleased with the improvements made in Xtree Pro.

          I  welcome  your  comments  and suggestions to anything I've
     written about, or something you think I should  write about. Down
     below, you'll  find several  addresses for  me. Included is my US
     mail address, FidoNet address,  and Usenet  address (with several
     paths). If  you're sending  me a  message through FidoNet, please
     mention to your sysop that mail  to  me  must  be  routed through
     157/1 since I'm a private node.

                    Echomail Conference List Notice

     Happy Holidays! I know it has been a long time since the
     last EchoList (issue 102) but issue 103 will finally be
     released on Christmas Day (12/25/87)! Since I'm running
     bare Opus v1.03a I should be able to entertain file
     requests from both Opus and SEAdoggies at 2400 baud
     with MNP3. The name of the file will be ELST103.ARC,
     please don't try to request it before Christmas day as it
     won't be available. You see it actually is Santa that has
     been slaving over the EchoList up in the North Pole :-)
     For some strange reason I got issue 103 and it has a note
     attached to it that say "Don't open til Christmas". Well
     nobody will know if I take this floppy out of its holder
     and put it into the drive to read it, right? <<PUFF>>
