     My Thoughts on Fidonet, 12/2/2000
     by Darrell Salter

     This is the third edition of "My Thoughts on Fidonet", the original
     being written in 1997 when I was the NC (Network Coordinator) of Net
     229. This document is originally posted on the web at
     http://sparkys.dyndns.org and you can check there first for updates
     to my writings. These documents have been consequently posted from
     the web site to various publications like Fidonews. It seems to be
     an editorial that has taken on a life of it's own because I get so
     much mail and so many comments about it, both positive and negative.
     Please, keep writing to me, I enjoy your comments, whether you agree
     with me or not. Fidonet is, after all, an association that was built
     on anarchistic principles, and is all about free and open
     communication.

     Yet again, a dangerous thing has been attempted (do people never
     learn?). A bunch of policy-thumping sysops marched into the FN_SYSOP
     echo and started spouting off about the new and improved proposed
     changes to Policy document #4. Hello? Was P4 ever sysop-ratified in
     the first place? It wasn't of course, and they know it. So what were
     they trying to do? Some of them probably thought the proposed ideas
     had merit and were genuinely trying to fix that sorry excuse for a
     policy document. But I think the real reason was far more insidious.
     They thought if they could get the sysops of Fidonet to approve a
     few minor changes that looked good to the sysops, it would
     constitute an approval for the whole document. Wrong! Nice try.

     Policy 4 has never been given the seal of approval from the sysops
     it is supposed to represent. What was done some 10 years ago was
     that a group of sysops known as RCs (Regional Coordinators) approved
     it. Why? Because P4 gave the RCs far-reaching powers to rule over
     the sysops of Fidonet. It was objected to then, and it is objected
     to now. If the policy thumpers want to add even more to Policy 4 and
     have it approved, they must get a sysop ratification of it. I don't
     care if they present the old P4, or a new one, for sysop
     ratification, but it needs to be voted on by the sysops in it's
     entirety.

     The challenge was laid out to the policy thumpers to have a sysop
     vote for their beloved document so as to settle this issue once and
     for all. Their reaction was typical and three-fold. First, they
     tried to claim that P4 was already ratified. Excuse me?
     SYSOP-RATIFICATION PLEASE, not RC ratification, for obvious reasons.
     Second, they coordinated a vicious attack of character assassination
     against those of us that were putting a wrinkle in their plans. This
     culminated with their arrogant proclamation, "if you don't like it,
     get out of Fidonet"! Um, excuse me again, but this is not a network
     belonging to the policy thumpers. They do not decide who stays and
     who leaves. The sysops do, collectively. In fact, this entire
     network belongs to the sysops, lock, stock, and barrel. We, the
     FIDONEWS 17-07               Page 3                   14 Feb 2000


     sysops, will decide all issues, thank you very much. Third, they
     bailed out in retreat. Once exposed, the policy thumpers scurried
     away in defeat to regroup. Some of them scrambled over to the Z1C
     echo where they attempted to enlist the Zone One Coordinator to help
     them in their crusade. Some others scrambled for the "moral
     high-ground" where they sit now and extol their virtuous pasts and
     stroke themselves with stories of glory days gone by when sysops
     were intimidated by policy, and those that used it to berate and
     belittle their fellow sysops. A few have stuck around to snipe at us
     but their guns, like their arguments, are empty. The end result was
     that no sysop ratification vote is being coordinated by the policy
     thumpers. They know all to well that sysops simply want to be left
     alone to run their systems as they see fit without some
     glory-seeking mob of beaurocratic wankers telling them what they
     must or must not do with their own computers, modems, phone lines
     and/or Internet connections.

                               First Principles
             Part II in a Series examining ZMH and FTS001 Issues
                David B. Smith, American Tune BBS (1:2410/104)

     Have been following the should-we-or-shouldn't-we discussions about
     ZMH & FTS-001 for a while, and haven't been firmly convinced by
     either side. Something's missing in both arguements.

     Why is ZMH important?  Why is FTS-001 important?

     Direct Netmail.  Heavy on the "direct."  If I don't follow ZMH,
     and/or if I don't comply with FTS-001, you won't be able to send me
     direct netmail, and with the latter, I may not be able to send you
     direct netmail.

     Naturally, that's always been considered important -- because in the
     beginning, that's -all- Fidonet was about -- direct netmail.  Tom
     Jennings and his friends would send messages directly one to
     another, and that was it.  No echomail, no filebones, not even
     routed netmail. Just Direct Netmail.

     As I have pointed out elsewhere, ZMH and FTS-001 appear to me to be
     focused at accomplishing the exact opposite of what's causing all
     the arguments.  Direct Netmail requires only one hour a day, and
     only one minimal standard, so that Fidonet impacts as little as
     possible on the primary objective -- the local BBS, with it's own
     local discussions, local gaming groups, local character & local
     color.

     And they exist only to consistently allow for -one- function, the
     first functionality offered by Fidonet, which is Direct Netmail.
     All the arguments for these two (other than "but it's Policy") have
     FIDONEWS 17-07               Page 4                   14 Feb 2000


     been "If you don't follow those standards, I can't send you Netmail,
     so the Net is broken."  Well, sorta.

     If you assume that sending and recieving -Direct- Netmail is
     absolutely vital to Fidonet.

     I don't think it is.  Sure, in a "spiritual" sense, perhaps.
     "Grasshopper, when you can snatch the netmail from my modem, then
     it's time for you to kill the Prince, go to America and make sappy
     TV programs."  It is the oldest Fidonet technical function.  But it
     isn't the only function, and it certainly isn't the most important,
     and hasn't been for years.

     And no Blue Lightning flashed down from the sky and struck me dead
     when I said that. <g>

     The individual BBS is the most important thing.  Fidonet is valuable
     to the extent that those individual, unique venues also produce
     content that can add value to other unique BBSes, and Fidonet gets
     it there.

     Direct Netmail is "necessary" in joining Fidonet to demonstrate a
     successful connection to Fidonet, the ability to move mail.  But I
     haven't recieved any direct netmail in a long time, and I have
     completely given up sending any.  Can't afford to.  Even my "local"
     network isn't local to me, and I can't afford to call directly from
     my system to theirs.

     And you just recieved this message.  The mail got moved anyway.
     Why? Because without making a direct POTS call to the next areacode
     over, I used my Internet connection to deliver it.  I can probably
     succeed in sending netmails to everybody in this echo, using that
     same method of connection.  Not direct, routed.  But netmail.  I'm
     successfully connected to Fidonet.

     The only necessity for ZMH comes from Direct Netmail.  And the only
     necessity for FTS-001 compliance is to insure ability for Direct
     Netmail.  And if you lost Direct Netmail abilities, probably nobody
     would notice.

     If my mailer had blown up permanently at Y2K (which almost happened)
     and I'd entirely lost my ability to send or recieve Direct Netmail,
     my ability to practically communicate with any other functioning
     Fidonet node in the world would have been effected not one whit.

     File moving?  The Internet using a couple-three techniques.
     Person-to-person messaging within Fidonet?  Routed netmail.
     Absolutely must be private messages?  Internet email, which can be
     encrypted, for that matter.

     But what if I absolutely, positively must get a message to you
     -right now-??  An LD phone call.  Direct netmail, especially during
     ZMH, won't get to -you- (as compared to your Board) till you wake up
     in the morning.

     Direct Netmail is a Real Nifty Trick.  It's been around an awfully
     FIDONEWS 17-07               Page 5                   14 Feb 2000


     long while, and there's kind of a sentamental attachment to it.  To
     Fidonet, it's like Code requirements to be Ham, or Full Immersion
     Baptism.  But let us finally realize that it is not the be-all and
     end-all of Fidonet.

     If you can do it, great, more power to you.  If you can't, you're
     missing something -- but you're not missing Fidonet.

     Douglas I feel a strong need to respond to Jim Rysyk's article, but
     I also will understand if you refuse to print my response.

     Here it is.

     RESPONSE TO JIM RYSYK'S ARTICLE

     FUCK OFF!


     -----------------------------------------------------------------


                                Notice of Suit
                email from "The Hunter" <chasers1@netzero.net>

     This is notice of suit to you, JIM HENRY AND AIRPOWER BBS AND
     DOUGLAS MYERS AND ROSS CASSELL AND FIDONET (AS AN UNINCORPORATED
     ASSOCIATION AND IT'S ASSOCIATION MEMBERS).

     Suit will instituted against you without further notice for breach
     of contract, tortious interference with advantageous contractual
     relationships, defamation/libel/slander as applicable and for other
     counts/basis which can be developed.  Subject to my further
     research, this may include an action brought under the Federal
     Racketeer Influenced Corrupt organizations statute.

     Whereas you are all members of Fidonet, Fido and Fidonews you are
     being served as such members by this notice.

     ---------------
     Subsequent message received from the same source:
     ---------------

     It is interesting that you moderated me AND contacted my sysop to
     the point that he locked me out of his board. You moderated me
     because I made "threats" of legal action without regard to the fact
     that I had grounds for such legal action. Now you have me in the
     situation where I cannot post to your conference, while your other
     posters post about me and slam me.

     Interesting how jerks like you preserve only your own freedoms and
     ignore those of others.  See you, your bbs and paonline in court.

     ---------------

     Editor's Response:  Your juvenile bid for attention is hereby
     acknowledged; however, I cannot take seriously the legal threats
     FIDONEWS 17-07               Page 7                   14 Feb 2000


     which you make.  Your deportment in your corrospondance to me and in
     the FIDONEWS echo in which you've posted lead me to believe that you
     are a child who does not receive the benefit of parantal supervision
     in his internet or bbs activities.

     Further, you have described a history of interaction with Fidonet
     sysops and moderators which exhibit the same immaturity of thought
     you've demonstrated to me.  I believe it's a reasonable conclusion
     on their part that you are a child.  I don't believe that any court
     of law would punish these adults for denying you access to their
     bbses or confirences - you see, society expects adults to remove
     children from situations in which they might get hurt... and you've
     told us time and again that this experience hurts you.

     I got this from Ol'WDB, though he didn't send it in for publication.
     Nonetheless, I thought it was a fitting sentiment for this
     Valentine's Day edition of Fidonews :)


     ROSES

     Red roses were her favorites,
     her name was also Rose.
     And every year her husband sent them,
     tied with pretty bows.

     The year he died,
     the roses were delivered to her door.
     The card said, "Be my Valentine,"
     like all the years before.

     Each year he sent her roses,
     and the note would always say,
     "I love you even more this year,
     than last year on this day.

     My love for you will always grow,
     with every passing year."
     She knew this was the last time
     that the roses would appear.

     She thought, he ordered roses
     in advance before this day.
     Her loving husband did not know,
     that he would pass away.

     He always liked to do things early,
     way before the time.
     Then, if he got too busy,
     everything would work out fine.

     She trimmed the stems,
     and placed them in a very special vase.
     Then, sat the vase
     bside the portrait of his smiling face.

     She would sit for hours,
     in her husband's favorite chair.
     While staring at his picture,
     and the roses sitting there.

     A year went by,
     and it was hard to live without her mate.
     With loneliness and solitude,
     that had become her fate.
     FIDONEWS 17-07               Page 9                   14 Feb 2000


     Then, the very hour,
     as on  Valentines before,
     The doorbell rang, and there were roses,
     sitting by her door.

     She brought the roses in,
     and then just looked at them in shock.
     Then, went to get the telephone,
     to call the florist shop.

     The owner answered, and she asked  him,
     if he would explain,
     Why would someone do this to her,
     causing her such pain?

     "I know your husband passed away,
     more than a year ago,"
     The owner said, "I knew you'd call,
     and you would want to know.

     The flowers you received today,
     were paid for in advance.
     Your husband always planned ahead,
     he left nothing to chance.

     There is a standing order,
     that I  have on file down here,
     And he has paid, well in advance,
     you'll get them every year.
     There also is another thing,
     that I  think you should know,

     He wrote a special little card...he did this years go.
     Then, should ever I find out that  he's no longer here,
     That's the card...that should be sent,
     to you the following year."

     She thanked him and hung up the phone,
     her tears now flowing hard.
     Her fingers shaking,
     as she slowly reached to get the card.

     Inside the card, she saw
     that he had written her a note.
     Then, as she stared in total silence,
     this is what he wrote...

     "Hello my love,
     I know it's been a  year since I've been gone,
     I hope it hasn't been too hard
     for you to overcome.

     I know it must be lonely,
     and the pain is very real.
     Or if it was the other way,
     I know how I would feel.

     The love we shared made everything
     so beautiful in life.
     I loved you more than words can say,
     you were the perfect wife.

     You were my friend and lover,
     you fulfilled my every need.
     I know it's only been a year,
     but please try not to grieve.

     I want you to be happy,
     even when you shed your tears.
     That is why the roses will
     be sent to you for years.

     When you get these roses,
     think of  all the happiness,
     That we had together,
     and how both of us were blessed.

     I have always loved you
     and I know I always will.
     But, my love, you must go on,
     you have some living still.

     Please...try to find happiness,
     while living out your days.
     I know it is not easy,
     but I hope you find some ways.

     The roses will come every year,
     and they will only stop,
     When your door's not answered,
     when the florist stops to knock.

     He will come five times that day,
     in case you have gone out.
     But after his last visit,
     he will  know without a doubt,

     To take the roses to the place,
     where I've instructed him.
     And place the roses where we are,
     together once again.

                             This Weeks Web Page
                                By Frank Vest


     Name: Welcome to NiNoNet
     Where: http://www.fido.nnov.ru/

     What's it got?:

     Never let it be said I don't like a page because I can't read it. :)

     This ia a Russian page for Net5015 in Zone2. First, it's not all in
     Russian. The header is in english. There are options for DOS KOI-8
     WIN MAC towards the bottom of the page. I love the dog. It's a
     floppy eared "hound" looking dog lying on the top edge of a 3.5
     floppy. :)

     The page is mainly a header page to offer options mentioned above
     for operating systems. I'll assume these are for the fonts connected
     with different operating systems to display the Russian properly.
     Once you've chosen the operating system, you're taken to a page
     that, other than the dog and a strip on the left side of the page
     with the Zone and Net, is unreadable to me. What can I say, my
     language is limited.

     If you're Russian, this would be a great page to look at. Even if
     you're not Russian, check it out. The dog is worth a look. :)


      Side note. I wish someone from these countries would review some of
     these pages and write articles about them. Being able to translate
     these pages would add much to the reviews.

     Till next time. :)

                         Refurbished Words of Wisdom
                                    Ol'WDB

     1. Do not walk behind me, for I may not lead. Do not walk ahead of
        me, for I may not follow. Do not walk beside me, either. Just
        leave me the hell alone.

     2. The journey of a thousand miles begins with a broken fan belt
        and a leaky tire.

     3. It's always darkest before dawn. So, if you're going to steal the
        neighbor's newspaper, that's the time to do it.

     4. It's a small world. So you gotta use your elbows a lot.

     5. Sex is like air; it's not important unless you're not getting
        any.

     6. We are born naked, wet, and hungry. Then things get worse.

     7. Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day. Teach him how to
        fish, and he will sit in a boat and drink beer all day.

     8. I don't have a license to kill. I have a learner's permit.

     9. Taxation WITH representation isn't so hot either!

     10. If you drink, don't park. Accidents cause people.

     11. Some days you are the bug, and some days you are the windshield.

     12. Don't worry. It's only seems kinky the first time.

     13. If at first you don't succeed, skydiving is not for you.

     14. Don't squat with spurs on.

     15. Never ask a barber if you need a haircut.

     16. Good judgment comes from bad experience and a lot of that comes
         from bad judgment.

     17. Never miss a chance to shut up.

     18. Generally speaking, you aren't learning much when your mouth is
         moving.

     19. Anything worth taking seriously is worth making fun of.

     20. Before you criticize someone, you should walk a mile in their
         shoes. That way, when you criticize them, you're a mile away and
         you have their shoes.

     21. Experience is something you don't get until just after you need
         it.

     22. Hey!  You can't tell me experience... I'll get it the hard way!

     23. The problem with the gene pool is that there is no lifeguard.

     24. If you don't feel close to God anymore, guess who moved.

     25. A real friend is one who walks in when the rest of the world
         walks out.

      A Chicago salesman on a business trip to Boston had a few hours to
      kill before catching a plane home. Remembering an old friend's
      advice to try some broiled scrod,,... a favorite fish in Boston, he
      hopped into a cab and asked the driver, "Say, do you know where I
      could get scrod around here?"

      The driver replied, "Pal, I've heard that question a thousand
      times, but this is the first time in the passive pluperfect
      subjunctive."

     a @ preceding an individual's name implies a virtual email
     address. The email is translated as follows
     firstlast@osirusoft.com will automatically route to the
     appropriate individual's email.  Anyone in this list will
     also receive routed notice of this feature.  In my case, it
     would still be joejared@osirusoft.com, but you get the idea.

     Also, as information is provided to me, I will be adding a
     latency field to each node, which is defined as the maximum
     time between when the message is received, and when it is
     sent on to other nodes, or available to be sent onward,
     defined in minutes. A latency of ! implies that there is an
     immediate response, and an attempt to deliver immediately
     after processing, or a "MinuteMail System", as it were.
