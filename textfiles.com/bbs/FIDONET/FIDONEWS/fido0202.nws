                            HOT NEWS

                Sorry this issue is so late; I got back from Boston
        Monday night, was too overwhelmed Tuesday to do it, trying
        to catch up from the lost week.

                The Fido List is no longer included in the
        newsletter. It's just too big. This issue is very large,
        partly because this was a long week (Monday to Wednesday) so
        there were a lot of articles. (Note that one very lengthy
        article was not included this issue; it will be included
        next week.)

                Bumper stickers are complete; they look pretty good.
        The artwork is a bit crude (the same doggie, about 4 times
        larger than the one on the manual cover) but it's simple and
        to the point. 

                I have 500 stickers; they cost me about $95.00, so
        here's the deal:

                $1.00   three stickers

                $5.00   twenty stickers

                Plus a SASE. (I'm soooo lazy ...) If I run out, it
        will take me another week or two to have more made; I'll
        inform you here if I do. My address is:

        -------------------------
        From: Jon Tara on FIDO 92
        Subject: Distribution of the newsletter & misc. comments

          
          1) I think that the concept is *great*.  Before Tom
        started the newsletter, I toyed with the idea, even sent out
        a couple of flocks of messages suggesting it.  *Somebody*
        has to eventually *do* something, rather than just talk
        about it, and I aplaud Tom for doing it!
          
          2) However, to be sucessful, the newsletter has to have
        wide, and automatic circulation.  My thought was that the
        net is just too big for free distribution - thus I had
        envisioned it as a commercial newsletter, maybe .50/issue.  

           I would still like to see a subscription service for
        those of us who would like regular delivery without having
        to call one of the major nodes manually and pick it up.  

           I am willing to provide this service, at cost.  (12-16
        cents per minute.)  All I ask is that *somebody* see to it
        that I get the newsletter FIDOmailed to me (preferably Tom).
           If you aren't in a major local net that already gets the
        newsletter, but would like to get it automatically, just
        send a $10 check to:

                      Jon Tara

                      1300 E. Lafayette #2808
                      Detroit, Michigan   48207
          
             This should get you about 20 issues, if the size of the 
        newsletter doesn't increase too much.  (Users!  Sponsor 
        receipt of the newsletter for your node...)

             I will return your checks if I don't get enough to make
        it worth-while to have Tom mail the newsletter to me.  (Like
        4 or 5.)
          
             Of course, if somebody wants to mail it out free to
        everyone: never mind!
          
             I do think that the newsletter (and the offshoots it
        may spawn) will be an incentive for further FIDOnet
        development, low-cost links, etc. which will reduce the need
        for such "commercial" services.

          3) Personally, I think that commercial ads that appear
        every week should be paid-for.  The revenue would allow Tom
        to send the newsletter to more nodes.  (It would be nice to
        see the newsletter automatically sent to all local nets over
        a certain size.)

          4) I think that the paginated format is over-kill.  How
        many people print these things out on paper?  I'd rather see
        an ARPAnet or Usenet (article next week!) type format, where
        articles simply follow each other, seperated by dashes.

        semi restricted

        Fido of the South has been running for about 2 years of
        which I  have been running it for about a year.  During this
        past year I  have seen a lot of versions of Fido come and
        go.  In the past 9  months I have had a very secure board,
        and I would like to share to other Fido sysops what I do and
        how well it works.

        I have my system set for private message system /M but any
        one who calls can log on and take a limited look around.

        I have used the Questionaire no password 'qnopwd' option. 
        Which  will interrogate any user who can not be found or has
        entered an  incorrect password.  The questionaire follows:


        This questionaire is designed to allow us to screen our
        potential users to provide the most productive environment
        for all.

        Where did you hear about this BBS?
        (1) A local IBM BBS.  (2) A non-local BBS (not in Atlanta)
        (2) A local non-IBM BBS   (4) A non-local non-IBM BBS
        (5) Somewhere else
        +5(1-5)?
        ?Where did you hear about us (enter 1 line of text)?
         

         
        Thank you for taking the questionaire!
        Access considerations generally within a week.
         


        If you need to tell the purpose of your bbs you can put it
        in  NOPWD.BBS which can tell new people that you are only a
        C board  or what ever. 
         
        The only hard part is having to sit down and type in the new 
        users using the sysop command, or you could always put this 
        questionaire in the answer-Questionaire section on Fido and
        set  the /P switch so that new users will have limited
        access until  you read the answers to their questionaire and
        give them normal  access.  

        All first time callers and people waiting for access can
        also  access Fido by a special name and password which is
        listed in the  WELCOME1.BBS file just before the bbs prompts
        for First Name:.  I  use; 

             First name FIDO
             Last Name GUEST
             Password FIDO

        Do Not put colons in the Welcome1.bbs file because some
        people who  have auto log on will have problems.
         
        Fido Guest has twit level access and I have carefully set
        the 3  command to allow the Guest to look at messages but
        not be given a  chance to enter a message even though they
        can't anyway.  I also  leave them a message to greet them to
        Fido.  You may also do this  with the /P switch and the
        internal questionaire by setting the  privilege of most of
        the board to normal and one message base and a file area to
        Disgrace will allow them to look around.

        I Do Not allow Handles on my BBS at all.  I feel if they can
        not  use their real name then they don't need to be on my
        board.

        Now that you have their Name and address, What do you do
        with it?  Well I have written several programs to collect
        this data and put  into a small data base where if there are
        any problems I can  quickly call the user up and solve them
        them.

        In the past few months Bulletin Boards here in Atlanta have
        been  victims of full-scale war from BBS crashers.  Fido 53,
        a close  neighbor to Fido 3, Abandoned the Fido Software
        because of a BBS  crasher who was using a handle and had
        access to the board and  the sysop had no address for him. 
        We have had only a few bad  messages on Fido 3 at which time
        I was able to call the user that  night and find that some
        one had gotten his password, which I  changed quickly.  If
        you are worried about bad messages on your  BBS it is very
        simple to find your self a good BBS'er who would  be glad to
        notify you about any wrong messages.

        Here at Fido of the South I have 4 other Sysops who help me 
        oversee the message base and more importantly the file area.
        Since I have many files which I can not run in the IBM I
        need  someone who can screen new files and supply the board
        with new  files.  This is my reason for so many Sysops.  In
        Atlanta we have  lots of Software manufacturers who would
        not appreciate it if I  had Copyrighted software on my board
        so all uploaded files go  into the NEWFILES directory.  Then
        one of the sysop, depending on  the computer, downloads it
        and sees what it is; then it is  transferred to the right
        section if no copyright is being  violated.


        There is one other thing that you can do with Fido's
        privilege  options and that is start a Club level.  On Fido
        of the South I  have two clubs who have their own message
        base and file section. I have given the Club members
        privileged access and then set the  higher systems of the
        board to allow only privileged users into  their area.  This
        works fine as long as you have someone watch to  be sure
        that a privileged user does not overstay their welcome on 
        the BBS, since Privileged users have double the access time.

        This is the method I use to protect my board and it works
        great. Please don't except Handles and lets be careful out
        their.

        If you are calling long distance you may access Fido of the
        South by entering;  
                      First Name:Sysop
                      Last Name:Guest
                      Password:Fido3
        Please leave me a message when you log off.

             "PLEASE...GET ME A MODEM FOR CHRISTMAS." This is the
        most common phrase I hear from children in the store around
        Christmas time.  It seems that every child that has a
        computer wants or needs a modem,  and often the parents go
        out and purchase a modem believing it to be  "just another







fidonews     --           16 Jan 85  23:17:14           Page 8

        program for the computer."
             For those of you who don't know what a modem is, or
        more  importantly, what a modem does, read on and discover
        the fascinating  world of telecommunications that opens once
        you own a modem. To get  the technical jargon out of the
        way, a modem is a modulator- demodulator, hence the term
        modem. Simply put, a modem translates  signals from your
        computer and changes them into signals your phone  line can
        accept, and takes signals from the phone line, and changes 
        them back so your computer can accept them. Actually, it is
        nothing  more than an interface between the computer and a
        phone line.
             Once you own a modem, and a suitable communications
        software  package you may then start exploring the wide
        world of computer  communications that becomes available to
        you. Some modems come  packaged with software and some do
        not, this being a choice of the  manufacturer. 
             One of the nice features that become available are the
        thousands  of  COMPUTER BULLETIN BOARDS that exist around
        the country. These  BBS's are usually called at no charge to
        you other than Ma Bell's  standard telephone charges as in
        any local call. No matter where you  live, there is a BBS
        close to you, that you can call. As I write this  article,
        there are new BBS's opening around the country. A BBS is a 
        service run by the owner of the computer, usually know as
        the SYSOP,  which stands for system operator. The sysop is
        the owner, and for the  most part, the final authority when
        it comes to questions or problems  that occur on the system
        that he runs. Most BBS's have all or some of  the following
        features.

        1) Public Message base allowing all callers to exchange
        messages.
        2) Private Electronic Mail (EMAIL) for private messages.
        3) Downloading and Uploading of PUBLIC DOMAIN software.
        4) On-Line interactive programs for the caller to use.
        5) Private conferences on varying subjects.
        6) Telex and Ecom services for business use.

             Again, the features provided by each system differ as
        to the  locality and the desire of the sysop to provide
        extra services. As a  new caller to a BBS, you will probably
        be allowed to read the  messages, leave messages, and view
        the available download files. After  you register with the
        sysop you will usually receive more services on  your next
        call.
             Some sysops require registration before you can even
        enter their  system's. This usually comes about due to
        pranksters who have annoyed  the sysop into running a closed
        BBS.
             I would like to remind all callers to any BBS, that
        access to a  BBS is a privilege, granted by the sysop. A
        similar analogy might be  that of a visitor coming into the
        sysop's home. If you behave, you are  welcome to return.
        Behave poorly and you might not be allowed back in.  Even
        the commercial services, like Compuserve have standard
        system  rules for all callers to observe, so please accept

        the rules, or do  not call.
             All bulletin boards that accept software for uploading
        and  downloading request that you upload ONLY public domain
        software, or  software that you personally hold the
        copyright on. This is for your  protection as well as the
        sysop's protection. BBS's have been closed  down due to the
        distribution of copyrighted software, so please abide  by
        this.          
             If you have a problem with the BBS, or don't understand
        a  feature, leave a note or comment for the sysop. He will
        gladly explain  the features involved, and correct the
        problem if need be. As the  sysop of a popular bbs, I
        appreciate a caller telling me about a  system error, and
        usually reward the caller with a higher access  level, for
        taking the time to leave me a note.
             The first thing you must do to communicate with another
        computer  is connect the modem to your computer. I would
        STRONGLY suggest you  study the manuals for both the modem
        and the computer before you  attempt this. The next step
        would be to load and run your  communications software
        commonly known as terminal software. Below you  find a table
        with the most commonly used settings for most types of 
        Bulletin Boards.

                       SPEED     PARITY    LENGTH    STOP BITS
                       =======================================
                       300       EVEN      SEVEN     ONE
                      1200       NONE      EIGHT     ONE

             Almost every terminal package comes pre configured to
        one of  these settings, so you should now be set and ready
        to.
             Now dial up the local BBS number or call my BBS at
        914-352-6801  and lets get you onto a BBS. If you are using
        a manual connect modem,  listen for a high pitched tone in
        the phone and then switch the modem  from phone to data. If
        you have an automatic modem, this will be done  for you. NOW
        SLOWLY HIT AT LEAST THREE CARRIAGE RETURNS. Most people  do
        not do this and end up with problems. This procedure allows
        the BBS  to recognize your transmission speed and type of
        data being sent so it  can match it for reliable
        communications.
             At this point you should get some type of welcome
        message on the  screen, or in some cases just a request for
        you to enter your ID,  PASSWORD, or ACCOUNT NUMBER. Read the
        message and see what it says for  a NEW CALLER to do. In
        most cases it says type NEW or NONE. You will  now be asked
        for your first and last name and in most cases, the city 
        and state you live in. On my BBS you will also be asked for
        a phone  number, so you can be verified and your access
        level raised. It is in  your best interests to supply
        COMPLETE, ACCURATE, and VERIFIABLE  information to the
        sysop. Private information is held in confidence by  most
        sysops, so I would not be worried about leaving this type of 
        information as the sysop needs it for verification purposes.
             Now, if all is well, you should start seeing more of
        the BBS.  Usually the menu will appear with all the







fidonews     --           16 Jan 85  23:17:32           Page 10

        commands, that make the  system run. At this point I would
        recommend you go ahead and explore  the system. There is
        little you can do to hurt a BBS, so go ahead and  try all
        the different functions to see what does what. A note here 
        about the CPC RRBS system. If you attempt to access a
        function that  you are not authorized for, you will get a
        message similar to,  "Sorry..your name..Authorization needed
        from the sysop." With the RBBS  system each one of these
        attempts is logged, and the system will  disconnect you, and
        lock you out if you go over a number know only to  the
        sysop. I ask my steady callers to let me know if they cannot 
        access something they have in the past, instead of making
        many tries  and getting logged of the system. Some times it
        is just a file error,  or an oversight by the sysop, and I
        correct these as soon as they are  brought to my attention.
             At some point in time, you might want to speak to the
        sysop. Most  systems have some type of CHAT feature which
        allows interactive  conversation between the caller and the
        sysop, so again read the menu  and examine all the options
        available. If you like the BBS then you  might want to leave
        a COMMENT or FEEDBACK to the sysop telling him so.  It helps
        when the sysop is there at 3 in the morning working on a bug 
        in the system to know that the callers appreciate his work
        and effort.
             When it comes to uploading and downloading many systems
        differ in  the features used, so we will cover only the two
        most commonly used  methods.
             Uploading is when you transfer a file to the host
        computer. The  host computer is in this case the computer
        that you called.  Downloading is when the host transfers a
        file to your computer.
             The most common transfer method is know as XMODEM or
        MODEM 7.  This is a method developed several years ago by
        Mr. Ward Christiansen  a pioneer in the field of
        telecommunications. Xmodem came about as a  need developed
        to be able to transfer files between DIFFERENT types of 
        computers without having a programmer convert the program
        for each  machine. Of course you still cannot run a
        commodore program on an  apple, but Xmodem allows you to
        transfer files between them with no  problem at all.
             Xmodem sends files in small segments and then checks to
        see that 
        the segment sent was the exact image of the segment
        received. If it is  not the same it sends the same segment
        again until it gets a valid  transfer. This continues until
        the file is sent correctly. The error  rate for an Xmodem
        transfer is less than 1/10 of one percent ! Of  course there
        is a small price to pay for this accuracy. Due to the 
        nature of the transfer at 1200 baud, you still only realize
        at the  highest a baud rate of 600, but most people feel it
        is worth it.  Xmodem is usually chosen when the file is a
        machine language file or  some other type of file that
        cannot be easily edited by the caller.
             The second type of transfer is know as an ASCII
        transfer. This is  used when the file is a text file with no
        control characters or other  system characters in it. ASCII
        transfers are much faster, but are  subject to errors in the







fidonews     --           16 Jan 85  23:17:42           Page 11

        reception due to noise, surges, etc; in the  phone lines.
             With an ASCII transfer, you must manually open your
        buffer and  then close it again at the end of the transfer.
             Once your level has been raised to allow file
        transfers, I would  suggest you read any and all help files
        in that area BEFORE you  attempt to do your first transfer.
             Again, I would like to remind you that the fastest way
        to get  thrown off a BBS is to upload commercial or
        copyrighted software.  There are thousands of public domain
        and user supported programs out  there, some of which are
        easier to use than commercial software and  many are more
        powerful in their features than commercial software. I 
        would say 50% of the over 400 Sanyo programs we have on our
        BBS are  public domain programs, which I have collected and
        put here for your  use.
             Remember to log off any system you call properly, as
        indicated in the menu. This allows two things to occur. The
        first is very important  if you are a new caller, as when
        you log off your information is saved  in the users file for
        future reference. The second thing that occurs  is that the
        BBS resets itself to get ready for the next caller. NEVER 
        end a session by just shutting down the modem UNLESS the BBS
        asks you  to disconnect that way.
             One other item you should be aware of is system
        maintenance. A  BBS takes many hours of work to maintain,
        and there will be times when  you call expecting the modem
        to answer you, and you get a voice  answer. This usually
        means that the system is being worked on, and  will return
        to service soon. If you get a voice answer, you might want 
        to speak to the person answering the phone. In most cases it
        is the  sysop, and he can tell you what is going on, and
        when he expects the  BBS to return to service. Also you
        might want to ask him questions,  and since you have him on
        the phone, go ahead..ask away.
              Once you are comfortable with the local services, then
        you can  start to check into the larger commercial services,
        such as  Compuserve, The Source, Delphi, and many of the
        other services  available. Some modems come with free
        connect time for either Compuserve or The Source and this
        time can be used to explore the  various services available
        to you on each of the services. You should  examine the rate
        structure on a commercial system, and understand  fully the
        charges involved, which range from $6 per hour in the 
        evening to $12.50 per hour during prime time. If you decide
        to  subscribe to a commercial system guard your password and
        change it on  a regular basis, to prevent use by un-
        authorized people, for which you  might be responsible.
             Compuserve uses several different protocols for
        transferring  files on their system. Xmodem has now been
        implemented as is available  in all areas of the system.
        Compuserve also supports their own  protocol's know as
        Protocol A and Protocol B. In order to use these  you must
        purchase a copy of Vidtex software for your computer. 
        Although similar in nature to Xmodem, Vidtex also has other
        features.  The most often used feature is one that is
        invisible to the user. When  you run Vidtex it sets aside a
        certain portion of memory as a 'send-a- a-head buffer' which







fidonews     --           16 Jan 85  23:17:52           Page 12

        the Vidtex host computer, in this case Compuserve  will fill
        with as many menu's as possible. This allows you to select 
        menu items without the host constantly resending the menus
        to you,  allowing the system to operate faster. Another nice
        feature of Vidtex  is the color and graphics displays that
        can be produced ONLY if both  the host and the caller are
        running Vidtex compatible software. As an  example of this
        in the weather menu on Compuserve there is a selection  for
        Vidtex weather maps. When you access this area, you receive
        a  graphic map displayed on your screen. Several of the
        games also use  this feature, and can be viewed by going to
        the games menu. A local  BBS called Mnematics also runs
        Vidtex, and can be reached at 914-365- 0183, 24 hours a day
        at both 300 and 1200 baud. Mnematics offers many  services
        to both their home and professional user alike, and is well 
        worth a call.
             Some of the many other features on Compuserve are
        Email, Telex  and Ecom messages, Special Interest Groups
        (SIGS), and personal  programming areas that allow you the
        use of many languages such as  Cobol, Fortran, Basic, and
        many others.
             A special note on SIGs. A SIG is a group of people with
        a common  interest, such as the IBM PC SIG. While the SIG is
        neither sponsored  or run by IBM, there are an incredible
        amount of PC/XT and AT users involved in this area. In my
        opinion, more technical knowledge  can be gained from this
        SIG, than from any other source of IBM  information. A
        special feature is the ability to follow a message 
        'thread', which is simply a reply to a reply to a reply to a
        message, thus allowing you to read the original message and
        all the replies,  comments, etc; that the message generated.
        It is in this manner which  I picked up more information in
        the use of 1-2-3 than from the manuals  which were good to
        begin with.
             The sysops on the IBM SIG are the finest on Compuserve,
        and are very experienced in the use of IBM equipment and
        programming. Any time  you have a question, they provide
        accurate, reliable answers, quickly!
             The SIGs also contain databases knows as ' XAs'. An XA
        contains  public domain software, or commercial software
        that the authors have  given explicit permission to be
        merged into the database, thus  supplying a caller with over
        1000 programs to choose from. Their are  SIGs for most
        common types of computers and most SIGs contain programs 
        for those types of computers. To get to the IBM SIG type GO
        PCS-131 at  any system prompt.Conferencing on the SIGs is
        also another good way for all callers to  share their ideas,
        with CO's being scheduled on a regular basis. Check  the
        bulletin area of your favorite SIG for the time schedules.
             Since I started this article, I understand that a
        second IBM sig has been added at PCS-129. The second SIG is
        for people just getting  started into computing, and has
        different software in it's databases.  Best of all 90% of
        the SIGs on Compuserve charge nothing to join or  download
        software.
             One other fascinating feature of Compuserve is the CB
        simulator,  which allows callers to communicate in 'real







fidonews     --           16 Jan 85  23:18:01           Page 13

        time' with each other.  Real time means that what you type
        is seen by all other people on the  channel with little or
        now delay. This allows callers from all across  the country
        to get together, just like they were on a real CB radio. 
        With two bands to choose from and at least 36 channels on
        each band  there is more than enough room for everyone.
             All of the commercial services offer many different
        services and  you are the only one who can decide which is
        right for you.
             If you have children who might be using the modem, sit
        down and  explain to them about the telephone charges and on
        line charges and  monitor them while they use the modem.
             An item that must be discussed here is accessing
        databases that  normally do not allow the public access,
        such as TRQ credit, Los  Alamos lab's and many others. The
        government is taking a serious  attitude about these types
        of illegal entries, and the MINIMUM fine is  usually
        confiscation of equipment. Now, you might be able to afford
        to  hand over better than $1000 to the government, but I
        can't.
             So, I feel the second rule in purchasing a modem would
        be to  understand exactly what a modem is, and provide
        ADEQUATE adult  supervision when it is in use.
             A fine example of a multi purpose BBS is the system we
        run known  as the ELECTRONIC STORE. After trying many
        programs we have settled on the NOCHANGE BBS program written
        by Jim Kloss. We had a need to try  and accommodate many
        varied interests so we could get the maximum  amount of
        callers possible. I feel we offer more features than any 
        other BBS running on a micro/mini system. For the serious
        programmers  we offer over 1000 programs to chose from when
        downloading. For the  not so serious caller we offer over 15
        interactive games, some of  which rival Vidtex for color
        graphics capability. Due to the unique  modular design of
        the BBS software, we add modules on a weekly basis.  Any
        basic program can be converted very simply to run over the
        system  thus allowing callers to have many various utilities
        at their disposal  and still not have to buy a bigger
        computer. Right now we have several  applications programs
        on line and plan on adding more as we go along.  With this
        type of design the number of available programs for a caller 
        to access in limited only by disk space, not memory
        available.
             We offer all callers the chance to take a booth in our
        FLEA  MARKET area, thus allowing them to advertise
        merchandise for sale in  an orderly fashion, with all
        callers getting a fair share of the  available market space.
        In our BBS watch area, the caller has a  listing of over
        5000 bbs numbers to choose from, and can produce a 
        customized report selecting various criteria such as
        state,type of  computer, baud rate, area code and many other
        criteria. A caller can  also rate any system that is listed
        and enter comments about the  particular system he is
        familiar with. All in all we offer a wide  range of services
        for all callers. Lately, we have been running an  average of
        80 to 100 callers per night, with most callers running one 
        of the many available programs. As time goes by we hope to







fidonews     --           16 Jan 85  23:18:13           Page 14

        add multi  user capability thus allowing multiple callers on
        line at the same  time to double the capacity of the system.
             Some of the more popular BBS's are now running under an
        operating  system that allows multiple users into the system
        at one time. A fine  example of this is the Central Core
        Information Service, which can be  reached at 914-221-0774,
        24 hours a day. The sysop, John Giberson, is  a tolerant
        individual, who works with the callers to make the most out 
        of his system. C.C.I.S. now supports three callers at one
        time, and  who knows, it might be four before very long.
        System Description - Fido 64, The Graf Spee
        Jay Maynard, SysOp

        The  Graf  Spee is a system I set up on my Compaq  Plus  computer 
        to allow folks I know,  and folks I don't know who ask me nicely, 
        to  get  access to my collection of public domain  utilities  and 
        interesting information. I originally got it when I needed to set 
        up a method for a friend who lives 45 miles away (no, Houstonians 
        don't  drive 45 miles regularly to swap disks!) to send me  files 
        for programming projects I was helping him with. I originally got 
        RBBS-PC for the purpose, but I had to spend a fair amount of time 
        just  getting the darn thing to work...it kept telling me I had a 
        'fixed  disk error 1701',  when everything else  worked  fine.  I 
        fiddled  around  with  that  for a while,  and  then  Paul  Wells 
        introduced Fido to the Houston area on El Dorado (Fido 48). I was 
        hooked...although the user interface was different,  it was  much 
        easier to use after a period of readjustment,  and the type-ahead 
        buffer was sheer heaven!  I got it from him and it ran first time 
        on the Compaq.  I have since used it as an intelligent unattended 
        file  download host,  and put it up nightly for FidoNet.  It  now 
        occupies the second major block on my hard disk,  right behind my 
        utilities subdirectory.

        Hardware Configuration:
        I  am running it on a Compaq Plus portable (like a 25 inch  color 
        TV)  computer,  with  640k of main memory,  one floppy,  and  the 
        standard 10Mb hard disk.  In addition to the standard complement, 
        my  Plus  has  an AST SixPak Plus  board,  loaded,  and  a  Hayes 
        Smartmodem  1200B.  (By  the  way,  I would  not  recommend  this 
        configuration  to Compaq fans out there...I have eaten one  power 
        supply already!) I also have a miscellaneous collection of  other 
        stuff,  including  an  S-100 bus Z-80 computer on which I run  my 
        real BBS,  The Packet Board (713-530-8596),  two printers,  three 
        other machines, and a partridge in a pear tree.

        Software Configuration:
        My Compaq came with MS-DOS version 2.02,  and I also have a  real 
        hodge-podge of other stuff resident in the machine from my normal 
        AUTOEXEC.BAT,  including  a  159  byte keyboard  buffer  (v-e-r-y 
        nice),  DPATH.COM (extends PATH support to data files,  sort of), 
        Seaware's Extended Batch Language version 2.01b, and Sidekick. So 
        far, my system has worked flawlessly...

        Fido Configuration:
        I set up two message areas and two file areas,  largely because I 
        was playing around.  Message area 1 is a general area,  where all 
        of  the  normal messages go,  and message area 2 is  the  FidoNet

        area.  It is restricted to SYSOP level users only,  as there  are 
        other Fidos in the area and I don't want to soak up long distance 
        bills. File area 1 is a general file area, and file area 2 is the 
        FidoNet files area...separated for the same reason. I have the /M 
        switch  set in my RUNBBS.BAT file,  and set the other  parameters 
        pretty well the way the distributed file does (although I do have 
        the  limits  turned  up).  I  decided  not  to  have  a  new-user 
        questionnaire  (QNOPWD.BBS),  because  I'm not going to  validate 
        anyone  I  don't  know...so  the option to  leave  a  comment  is 
        sufficient. 

        Installation Notes:
        Setting up Fido for this application was ridiculously  simple...I 
        simply   ran   SETUP.BAT,   and  then  played  around  with   the 
        subdirectories  (mainly deleting them).  From startup to  running 
        system  was  about 2 hours,  and that includes a lot  of  manual-
        flipping.

        I think that Fido is probably the neatest BBS running...and  I've 
        seen quite a few. The user interface could use some work, and the 
        RBBS-PC  bigots  in  town  complain about the  lack  of  graphics 
        ability, but all in all, it's the best one I've met.

        If  you  have any questions,  please send them  via  FidoNet...my 
        system is up nightly for that very purpose,  and that's  probably 
        the most reliable way to get me a message. Any other time, either 
        the  phone'll  ring and ring or you'll get to hear  my  melodious 
        voice (snicker!).

        Now  that  I've broken the ice,  how about the rest of  you?  I'm 
        dying to see how everyone else is doing it.

        I would like to make the following recommendations:
        1) Allow a line of text in QNOPWD.BBS to be longer than 80 
        characters.  At least extend it to 132.  I'd like to do some 
        fancy screen displays with my Rainbow but am limited by that 
        constraint.  Most escape sequences take an extra 6-8
        characters  each.  (I know that limits my user base to only
        RB users, but  thats fine with me).

        [ If I ever get around to it ... a valid suggestion. ]

        2) If you have FIDO's for different machines (FIDO_DEC,
        FIDO_IBM,  etc.) why not incorporate more of the machine
        dependent controls  in them (e.e., use the <HELP> key for
        help instead of "?" and use  the function keys to make File
        Area or Msg Area selection.

        [ ... because its hardware independent. In order to do that,
        Id need a "universally" defined way to specify non-ASCII
        keys; I dont. Also, since many of these keys generate odd
        code sequences (DEC: escape codes; IBM; null followed by an
        8 bit byte) they often get filtered out by comm. programs. ]

        3) I'd like to see the menu options displayed 'frozen' in
        the top  or bottom 1 or 2 rows of the screen, highlighted or
        whatever.   Watching a scrolling display is poring $







fidonews     --           16 Jan 85  23:18:31           Page 16

        primative.  I'd like to  see Fido use more of the display
        capabilities of the Rainbow.

        [ Again, hardware dependent, and most comm. programs do not
        supprot it. It has to be done in the users comm. program;
        Fido cannot do anything. Note that a Minitel and Fido
        combination will be able to do this sometime this summer.
        You can do it now on DECs by putting the scrolling region
        stuff into the help files. ]
        4) How come the word privilege is misspelled throughout the 
        program and documentation?

        [ Cause I dont own a dictionary ]
        5) What did you do to the S/W between v10a & v10a1/2.  I use
        to  be able to direct output to my printer out of RUNBBS.BAT
        (ctty  prn).  Now I can't.

        [ Thats should not happen ... will look at it. ]
        6) How do I input additions to the Oper. Manual.  I have a
        Racal  Vadic 3451P modem.  It took some strap cuttings on
        one of the  boards to get it to work right.  It also bugs me
        to see RV212  come up when I start Fido_dec.  How about a
        param for the 3451?

        [ In order to support any hardware, I need access to the
        hardware for testing. I also need manuals. I cannot code for
        something I didnt even knew existed. ]
        7) It would also be nice to know if any msgs have been left
        for  you when you first log on instead of having to go into
        each msg  area & look.  Couldn't that kind of status be kept
        in USER.BBS  where you verify the login.  At least a
        'MESSAGE(S) WAITING'  prompt after log on would let you know
        to look or not.  Ideally,  would be to see the msg areas & #
        of msgs waiting in each area.

        [ I coded that into a test version; for 8 message areas, it
        took over 5 minutes ... quickly removed it. There will be
        some changes in that dept. soon ... ]
        Like I said above, I love the Fido program.  I've been
        hooked on  it since I got a copy at DECUS in Anaheim.  I'd
        be happy to  enhance it to use more of the RB functions. 
        I'm sure you don't  want anyone mucking around with your
        S/W, but maybe you could  send me the subroutines that do
        the displays and I could send   submit them to you for your
        acceptance.  I've been in the computer field since '66 and
        have an extensive background in the industry.  I work for a
        Navy research lab in DS & teach part time at UCSD.  I also
        am chairman of the Rainbow LUG in San Diego.

        [ Fido uses a very large set of hardware independent
        libraries; it is a major project to add things like function
        keys. The main problem functionally is that I have no
        control over comm programs, and most computers dont have a
        consistent way of addressing the cursor remotely, if they
        have one at all. One absolute design rule I use is that Fido
        must be compatible with EVERYONE; about the only machines it
        is hard to work with are ones with less than 10 lines and 20

        columns. Until things are more consistent, changes in screen
        handling will be made very slowly. The future
        Minitel/Telink/Fido screen support is going to be complex
        internally, and only possible because I have control at both
        ends. ]

        I RUN THE FOLLOWING BATCH FILE EVERY MORNING WHEN I COME IN
        AND IT MAKES LIFE MUCH SIMPLER FOR ME AS A FIDO SYSOP.

        I CALL THIS FILE SYSOP.BAT

        COPY SYSOP.LOG LPT1
        ERASE SYSOP.LOG
        COPY MAILER.LOG LPT1
        ERASE MAILER.LOG
        COPY ASNWERS.BBS LPT1
        ERASE ANSWERS.BBS
        FIDOUSER.EXE

        THIS TAKES CARE OF NINETY NINE PERCENT OF THE WORK
             As a young puppy (new Fido Sysop) I have just started
        to enter the fascinating world of FIDO. In case you do not
        know, FIDO is the world's first BBS network. BBS network,
        you ask ? Yes, FIDO is a complete BBS program complete with
        the normal Electronic user to user mail, multiple bulletin
        boards, file transfers, and FIDO NET Mail.

             Fido is the brain child of Mr. Tom Jennings of San
        Francisco, California. Tom did the original programming, and
        still produces all the updates as needed to keep FIDO error
        free and running properly. FIDO is written in the C
        language, and as such is about as fast as I have ever seen a
        BBS run. FIDO requires 256k of memory, MSDOS 2.0 or higher
        and at least 2 floppies to run on. It is recommended that
        you use a hard disk whenever possible.

             At this point in time FIDO is available for the IBM PC,
        XT, AT, and PC Junior, as well as the Dec Rainbow 100, 100+,
        100B, and the Otrona Attache 8:16. A Sanyo version is almost
        ready for release and by press time should be ready for
        distribution.

             Let us now explore FIDO one section at a time, and see
        what makes this program the ULTIMATE in BBS software.

             The message area can consist of up to 99 separate
        boards with each board devoted to a different subject
        matter. Each area can have it's own access level thus
        allowing any caller any combination of boards that you the
        Sysop desire that caller to be able to access. When you set
        up the board initially you have 2 message areas that callers
        can enter, read and write to, and a special area devoted to
        replies from the Sysop to feedback messages left by your
        callers. In the message area are the usual commands as well
        as two special ones the merit attention. The first is the
        REPLY command. This is used when a caller wishes to reply to
        a message left by someone else. It sets up a message thread







fidonews     --           16 Jan 85  23:18:47           Page 18

        that is managed by the program. If a message in the thread,
        or at the beginning or end of the thread is deleted the
        thread remains intact and can still be accessed. The second
        command is the READ REPLY command which allows the caller to
        read the entire thread from beginning to end. These two
        commands come in very handy, especially when the messages
        are about a newly released hardware or software item, and
        the users comments pertaining to the use, and or problems
        with such products. This is the least used command, and it
        is really a shame to let that much power goto waste.

             The second area is the file transfer area. Here the
        Sysop can set up to 99 separate areas for the transfer of
        software, text and documentation files, or whatever his
        users need to have access to. As before each area can have
        different security levels, thus allowing many possible
        combinations for each caller. At last count there were 9
        different transfer protocols built into the program thus
        allowing a multitude of different computers to upload and
        download software.


             The Sysop has many choices in this area in setting the
        security levels thus preventing un-authorized access and use
        of software. If a caller does not have a high enough level,
        he just never sees a particular area, and thus will not even
        know of it's existence. This feature I make use of while I
        am out on the road visiting a client. I can call in and
        access any or all of my own software, WITH no other caller
        even know where it is, or how to get to it. The people who
        wrote the security portions of this BBS certainly deserve a
        lot of credit for their insight into potential problems that
        might occur.

             The caller can change many of his attributes at any
        time thus allowing him to customize the program to benefit
        him the most. This is the CHANGE area on the main menu.


             FIDONET or FIDO Mail is actually a program inside a
        program. This is perhaps the most powerful aspect of the
        entire system. FIDONET allows a caller the capability to
        send messages to any of the other FIDO BBSs in the world,
        just by calling into his local FIDO system. The first
        INTERCONTINENTAL FIDO message was recently sent from FIDO
        number 117 in Jakarta, Indonesia to FIDO number 51 in St.
        Louis. FIDO boards operate at this time in the United
        States, England, Sweden, and of course Indonesia, with one
        to open in Israel in the near future.


             FIDONET collects the messages left on the BBS in the
        FIDONET area, and groups them into packets for transmission
        to each FIDO there is a message waiting to be transmitted
        to. Then during the National Mail Slot, each FIDO initiates
        calls to the other FIDO systems it has messages for and
        transmits them. Expensive you might wonder ? The answer has







fidonews     --           16 Jan 85  23:18:55           Page 19

        to be a definite NO !! Each FIDO has it's own node number
        which makes it unique in the network. In our case all of our
        incoming mail is routed thru our host in New York City. This
        allows the individual FIDO systems to group together in one
        packet many messages for all the systems served by my host
        and make ONE transmission thus cutting down the number of
        calls each system makes. When the message packet is received
        it is decoded and new packets are then assembled for each of
        the systems the host serves. Then in the second local time
        slot all of these message packets are then sent on to their
        destinations. The routing system also helps to keep costs
        very low. Many times your callers enter 35 messages to let's
        say a total of 12 different FIDO systems. However of these
        35 messages perhaps 25 of them are routed thru 6 host
        systems. This cuts the number of calls your system makes
        that night from 35 down to 12 calls in all. As you can see
        this makes for a definite savings.


             The network is totally synchronized so that all of
        these transfers can take place with no Sysop intervention.
        It is automatic and totally transparent to the average user
        of your system.

             Tom and all the other programmers have got this working
        so well now that the average cost to send a message and/or
        program of 7000 characters is a mere 25 cents. Where else
        can can you get overnight service for that low of a price.


             The Sysop program allows you to set up each user with
        an account and this account is charged each time a message
        is successfully sent. Some Sysops only allow people to send
        FIDONET mail when they have first made a deposit to cover
        the costs, and others give callers FIDONET credit when they
        upload software, thus allowing the user to make full use of
        FIDONET and the system to grow with each upload.


             The support given behind this software is perhaps the
        best in the industry. As each new Sysop comes online, he
        finds an experienced Sysop to help him with the initial
        setup of his system. Of course a new new Sysop can also send
        FIDONET mail to Tom at FIDO number 1, and get help in that
        fashion. The documentation is perhaps the only sore point of
        the entire system. Copious as it is, the doc's leave a
        little to be desired by the average first time Sysop.


             As each new system gets ready to run, the Sysop must
        send a FIDONET message to FIDO 51 requesting a node
        assignment. This serves a dual purpose of making sure
        FIDONET is working on his system, and allowing each new
        system to be properly placed in the Node list and the route
        list which are updated with additions, deletions, and
        changes EVERY Friday night which keeps the lists as current
        and as up like no other BBS list.







fidonews     --           16 Jan 85  23:19:04           Page 20


             In fact if a master update was needed a Sysop could
        send a message to every node, and as each was received the
        message would be deleted. At the end of a week or so, as all
        the messages are delivered  or not delivered (allowing for
        hardware problems, etc;) one could get a complete ACCURATE
        list of all the nodes not taking messages at that time.

             Sounds good you say. Where do I purchase this system
        from ? Well that's the best part of FIDO. If you are a die
        hard, it must be in a book type of person, then you may
        purchase the program, complete with printed manuals and
        binder from the author. Tom's address is as follows.


             Fido Software

             San Francisco, California 94114
             
             If you are willing to experience the joy of doing it
        yourself then FIDO may be obtained at NO CHARGE simply by
        downloading it from almost any of the FIDO systems. Most
        systems that have the software for downloading have a file
        called GETFIDO. Read this file first to see exactly what
        files you need to download for your computer system.

             Make sure you get the get the Documentation file and
        the Sysop program for your type of computer. I can't speak
        for any other Sysop but if you need help in setting up,
        please feel free to call voice from 9 am to 5 pm at (914)
        352-6801 or if you desire to see FIDO in action call the
        above number from 6 pm to 9 am. We accept 300 and 1200 baud
        and use the normal parameters for the speed you select.


             All in all, this is perhaps the best BBS system around,
        and I have run several other systems. I am one of the many
        Sysops who changed over from RBBS to FIDO. This system will
        also run under Multi-Link thus allowing multiple users to
        access the system.
