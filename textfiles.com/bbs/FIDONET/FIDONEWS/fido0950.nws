Nothing new this week, really.

Really.

So I'll just shut up.

Oh yeah, please send more questions for the "Ask EFF!" column.

What's "Ask EFF!"? Well, the premiere column ran last week. It will be
a monthly column devoted to BBS & FidoNet'ing legal issues for sysops
and users. Questions sent here will be answered by Shari Steele, a
telecomm-savvy staff lawyer form the EFF (Electronic Frontier
Foundation). Here's the little infobox that preceeds each column:

and take a look to see what they're about.  Or contact the EFF at
eff@eff.org via Internet. Sorry, no FidoNet access...)




Well, one more thing. I've generated a PGP 2.x public key for
FidoNews. It is included in the boilerplate section at the end of
FidoNews. If you feel the need, you can secure correspondence to
FidoNews using the public key.

AARGH! Because of a bug? misfeature? of 4DOS and NETWARE LITE, when I
MOVEd the files John sent me to the fnews directory on the FidoNews
BBS, they disappeared. You can filerequest them still from Johns
system. Thanks John! I hate all software.

======================================================================
                               ARTICLES
======================================================================


Some Thoughts on Recent Articles
Name withheld for obvious reasons

    In issues 943 and 944 of FIDONEWS, two articles stood out
for me. The first was an editorial by Mr. Jennings wherein he
speculated that a lost girl, found through FIDO, may not have
wanted to be found. The second was an article lauding all those
who participated in said finding. I have waited in vain to hear
any response to eithor of those articles, perhaps because I am a
coward, and the pieces hit just a little too close to home. I
have thought about it for several weeks, and decided that
someone has to speak up. Hence this.

    I am going to make it short and sweet ... attempt to tell it
as a story.

    I am married to a lovely lady, about 33 years old. When she
turned 12 or so, like most young girls, she started to develop
as a woman. Unlike most young girls, however, she also started
to get raped by her father two or three times per week ...
maybe that is not unlike most young girls ... I know only that I
find it horrific.

    At fourteen, she started to run away from home. She was
found and returned. More rape. She comes form a wealthy and
politically well connected familly. Excellent access to police,
excellent access to judges. In fact, the judge that would hear
any child abuse cases was appointed by her father.

    Nevertheless, her father began to get worried. He hired a
psychiatrist in an attempt to get her committed. It is a
measure of the power of Authority, perhaps, that this
psychiatrist, although a respected member of the establishment,
was afraid to blow the whistle. It is a measure of human
decency that he assisted her in running away, this time
successfully.

    She changed her name and country, and began to live on the
streets as a fifteen year old. Twice she was tracked ... both
times she was able to dissappear. She put herself through
highschool, and then through university (BA & MA). She earned
her way both illegally and legally ... everything from dealing
drugs to delivering pizza.

    I met her when she logged into my BBS and argued quite
eloquently for aliases. She had been validated under an alias,
but one that was also in the phone book. It was not the same as
the name on her degrees, nor the one that she works under.
Eventually I gave her a yet another by marrying her.
FidoNews 9-50                  Page 4                      14 Dec 1992


    We are learning, she and I. I am learning that my middle
class background does not qualify me to make judgements, and I
am learning street smarts (which I always thought I had). She
is learning not to hide.

    But when I read those two pieces, I could not help but hear
her response to me, in one of those countless talks that we have
had on people, and on society, and on trust. She had expressed
a profound mistrust of a couple that I rather liked. I asked
why, coupled with the observation that they were both kindly
people. Her reply was succinct and to the point.

    "Whenever I ran away, f*****s like that always helped the
police to bring me back. They are do-gooders that insist only
their standards and world-view apply to everything".

    I hestitate to condemn efforts such as the one made to find
that little girl. I also think that times have have changed in
the last twenty years ... perhaps a young girl of today has a
chance of being believed. That, of course, presumes she has the
nerve to state the truth. My wife would simply say that she
would be stupid to make the assumption ... smart kids run.

PGP-Toss.LZH - Pretty Good Privacy Tosser

Objectives:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

    Echo Mail and Network Mail directories are scanned for *.MSG message
    files which contain PGP encrypted messages. When such mssages are
    located, PGP-Toss will either move them to another directory or make
    a copy of each message into another directory.

    PGP-Toss can also return PGP encrypted mail to the origination system
    automatically, allowing the message to be marked as either "HOLD for
    pick-up" or "IMMEDIATE transmission."

    After a PGP-type message has been processed, it is 'marked' as having
    been processed by setting the first character in the 'subject' field
    with a '.' (a period character.) PGP-Toss will ignore all messages
that
    have subjects which are preceeded with a period.

Why?
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

FidoNews 9-50                  Page 5                      14 Dec 1992


    To accumulate PGP texts automatically and put them into a single
    directory for review or further automatic processing. This enables
    operators and Users to use the PGP project a little easier. Public
    Keys which are exchanged in EchoMail forums as well as encrypted
    messages may be copied to an accumulation subdirectory or folder.

    In addition, those systems which would not like to allow encrypted
    messages to pass through their systems can intercept them, accumulating
    them in a directory, and then either destroy them or return them to
    the origination system.

Kludge Lines Supported:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

    PGP-Toss, when automatic message returns are enabled, will provide
    the following kludge lines in the *.MSG files it creates:

        MSGID
        FLAGS IMM, DIR
        FMPT
        TOPT
        INTL

Diagnostic displays:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

    If /diag is offered on the command line, PGP-Toss will offer
information
    on what it is doing while it is processing the messages areas it
is told
    to look in.

Configuration elements:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

    The environmental variable PGPTOSS is used to tell PGP-Toss what
    directory the PGP-TOSS.CFG configuration file is located in. If the
    environment variable is not set, the current directory is assumed.

                        set PGPTOSS=C:\UTIL\

    A sample configuration file follows. This is offered for a detailed
    description of how and what this project does:

        ; What is your systems network address? Please use the standard
        ; format and syntax for this, include the point and zone, please.

        system          1:102/890.0

        ; The look command describes a directory to search for PGP
        ; messages. There may be any number of these commands. The
FidoNews 9-50                  Page 6                      14 Dec 1992


        ; sequence of search will follow the sequence in the
configuration
        ; file. There must be at least one such command.

        look            c:\fd\echo\socal
        look            c:\fd\echo\net102

        ; Messages containing PGP stuff may be either moved to a holding
        ; directory or copied to another directory. Messages may not be
        ; both copied and moved BOTH.
        ;
        ; If PGP messages should be returned to the originator, this value
        ; would usually indicate the path to the network mail
directory and
        ; the 'return' value in the configuration file below would be set
        ; to YES.
        ;
        ; If messages are not to be moved out of the echo mail directory
        ; and moved into another directory, the value which follows the
        ; MOVE-TO keyword should be "NONE"

        move-to         c:\fd\pgphold

        ; Messages containing PGP stuff may be copied to another
directory
        ; without killing the original. If you do not wish a duplicate to
        ; be placed in another directory the value which follows the
        ; COPY-TO keyword should be "NONE"
        ;
        ; If the value offered is the network directory, the RETURN
        ; command below would be set to YES to automatically return the
        ; message to the originating system.

        copy-to         none

        ; Messages that contain PGP text may be returned to the

        ; The value here is YES or NO with NO being the default.

        return          no

        ; Messages that are to be returned to the origination system may
        ; be marked for 'Hold for pick-up.' This value configures

        ; Messages that are to be returned to the origination system may
        ; be marked a "immediate mailing." This value configures

        ; The value here is YES or NO with NO being the default.

        immediate       no

        ; Every time a message is copied or moved, a log file entry can

        ; set to YES else it should be set to NO. Default is NO.
        ;
        ; The log file name is :  PGP-TOSS.LOG

        log             yes

ErrorLevels:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
    The PGP-Toss program wll return with an error level which is used to
    indicate to the calling batch file what the condition of the projects
    compleation was. The usual return value of 0 indicates a successfull
    run. However, when there are failures of some sort, the following
    ERRORLEVEL values will be returned:

        No_Problems             0
        Missing_Config          10
        No_Memory               11
        Config_Return_Error     12
        Config_Hold_Error       13
        Config_Immediate_Error  14
        Config_Look_Error       15
        Move_Copy_Bad           16
        Cant_Read_Message       17
        Cant_Open_File          18
        Cant_Create_File        19
        Cant_Write_Message      20
        Cant_Update_Message     21
        Reseek_Error            22
        Bad_System_Address      23

The Future
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
    In version 1.2, it is hoped, the project will be able to offer a
    list of the so-called "Security HUBs" that appear in the nodelist.
    In version 1.2, the command line argument /list will list all of
    the Security HUBs in the systems Zone and Network, if any. If the
    command line argument is /listall, the project will offer a list
    of all Security HUBs appearing in the nodelist.

    This update wll be performed when the nodelist flag for the
FidoNews 9-50                  Page 8                      14 Dec 1992


    Security HUBs is approved. It is requested that no one take the
    source code and make further releases until I have finished this
    update.

Who's checking the Nodelists?

A few months back, I started to write a utility to generate nodelist
statistics. I wanted to get some statistics that none of the ones I'd
seen provided.

Based on my experience with other databases, as a first step, I wrote
some code to generate a list of the nodelist flags that were *actually*
used. As I expected, there were flags in use that weren't in the spec.
What I *didn't* expect was the *number* of "illegal" flags and
otherwise non-compliant entries.

There is also a completely ridiculous number of "user flags", but
that's a matter for another article.

I've polished up the original code a bit and run it against
NODELIST.346. The resulting output is reproduced below. All 294 "bad"
entries (Unless the editor chopped them :-). Note that many of these
entries have been "bad" for over 3 months! The format is:

FidoNews 9-50                  Page 9                      14 Dec 1992


zone(region):net/node  <flag list>

If the flag is in paratheses, that means that it's a *legal* flag, but
that it was found *after* the first user flag. Which means that all
FTS-0005 compliant nodelist processors will *ignore it (ie it's a waste
of space in the nodelist).

If some one would care to make the check program available for FREQ,
I'll File attach it to them (I'm non-CM, so FREQing me is not a good idea!)
BTW, the program will parse any FTS-005 nodelist OR NODELIST SEGMENT
(hint, hint)

Here's the list. Read it and weep...

PGP 2.1 Available

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

PGP 2.1 Available
- -----------------

Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) Version 2.1 is now available, from Europe.
This new version of the world's most popular and politically
controversial public key encryption program has numerous bug fixes
over version 2.0, and several new features.

For example, you can now display the MD5 hash of a public key, to
facilitate verifying it over the telephone with the owner of that
public key.  Also, it is now possible to send via email an
unencrypted signed message without putting the whole message in
Radix-64 format, to make it possible to read without PGP.  This is
analogous to the PEM MIC-CLEAR signed message functionality.

FidoNews 9-50                  Page 15                     14 Dec 1992


PGP 2.1 incorporates many patches from the user community to port it
to more platforms.  And it runs faster.  Also, a lot of annoying bugs
and ergonomic oversights have been fixed.  PGP 2.0 fans will find
many rough edges have been smoothed out.

The filenames are pgp21.zip for the MSDOS executable release, and
pgp21src.zip for the source code release.  You must have PKUNZIP
version 1.1 or later to unzip them, or they won't unzip.  The primary
initial FTP sites that have it are:

Finland:    nic.funet.fi  (128.214.6.100)
            Directory: /pub/unix/security/crypt/

Italy:      ghost.dsi.unimi.it  (149.132.2.1)
            Directory: /pub/security/

As previously, this prohibited and politically popular program will
probably propagate through the same channels as PGP 2.0.  Of course,
if you live in the USA, you really shouldn't be using it.

If you have any questions about where else to get it, contact Hugh
Miller, at hmiller@lucpul.it.luc.edu.  Hugh can send you the latest
evolving list of FTP sites, BBS phone numbers, and other sources.

The Swedenborgian Ideas Echo

Are you interested in Christianity, but turned off by the conservatism
and literalistic Bible interpretations found in many of the religious
echoes? Then the Swedenborgian Ideas echo may be for you.

The Swedenborgian Ideas echo is a forum for discussing the spiritual
and philosophical ideas of the new Christianity as envisioned by
Emanuel Swedenborg (1688-1772). Swedenborg was a scientist and
philosopher who later turned his mind toward religion. By his account,
he spent the last thirty years of his life conscious in both the
spiritual world and the material world at the same time. He believed
that the Lord had called him to reveal new ideas which would
revitalize Christianity. Here are a few of his basic ideas:

1) There is one God: the Lord Jesus Christ. The Father, Son, and Holy
   Spirit mentioned in the New Testament are not three different
   persons of God, but three different aspects of God, analogous to
   our own soul, body, and actions.

2) The Bible has a spiritual meaning which tells the story of our
   inner spiritual growth and development. This deeper meaning is
   accessible to us via a type of symbolism called "correspondences."

3) We create our own heaven or hell by the choices we make in our
   lives. People of all religious beliefs--or no particular religious
FidoNews 9-50                  Page 17                     14 Dec 1992


   belief--can find heaven and be "saved" if they love God and show
   kindness to other people according to their own beliefs.

If you would like to discuss this new Christianity in an open
atmosphere, the Swedenborgian Ideas echo is for you. If you just want
to push your own religious beliefs on others, please don't bother.

The Swedenborgian Ideas echo is listed in the Fidonet Echolist, with
the echotag SWEDENBORG. It is available to sysops from the Moderator,
Lee Woofenden, at 1:3401/101. If you are not a sysop and would like to
follow the Swedenborg echo, it is now available on the following BBSs:

points. It requires no additional software, such as conference mail
processors, compression software, FOSSIL drivers or other external
utilities; operating in a minimum system environment of 400kb of
diskspace and 384k of RAM.

Anyone can configure and use FrontDoor APX in minutes, experience
in electronic mail systems is not required. With the easy
installation, coupled with an extensive on-line help system available
at the touch of a key, FrontDoor APX can be installed and configured
in less than 15 minutes.

FrontDoor APX allows the exchange of private and conference mail, as
well as file requests and file attaches with a designated server.

Security comes naturally with FrontDoor APX, providing session and
packet level password security.

FrontDoor APX is designed to operate with a single server, such as
FrontDoor. All transactions are with the server system, affording
management control of all transfers. A network can be configured to
include as little as a single FrontDoor Server and a single FrontDoor
APX point, or it can include unlimited FrontDoor APX points operating
under multiple FrontDoor Servers. FrontDoor APX and FrontDoor can
meet your requirements, whatever they are.
