'Tis the season to ... "Hang the last ZC with the guts of the last
RC!", well, maybe we could keep that figurative and hold an election
that should be simple oh wait... heh heh. But I digress. Nice weather
we're having here, isn't it? Did you hear something? Not me! I am
soooo glad I don't have a /0 in my FidoNet address!

Ahem. This week we have oh never mind, you'll see.





Many thanks to Gary Vedvik (1:102/1006) for giving me his NLSTATS
program, which generates statistics from the nodelist, as well as
pulling out those sneaky announcements of your fate hidden deep in the
bowels of the nodelist. (Well, I guess it's not that bad, it's
delivered to my virtual door weekly, all I have to do is read it...)
Now, when I get my nodelist, I'll produce an "article" file I can
check for is/is-not-worth-bothering-with for possible inclusion in
FidoNews. In case you're as lazy as I am and don't read the nodelist
comments.




I'm not getting many questions for the new "Ask EFF!" column which

 | The Zone 1 Coordinator interim replacement election has ended.

 You can request the most recent nodelist/nodediff from your Network
 or Region Coordinator. They are usually available with the "magic name"
 of NODELIST or NODEDIFF.

                The combination of the accepted nodelist flags.
                ===============================================

This is a follow-up to my article about failed
nodelist flags last week.

I have currently received two notes about that article, where one was
from Leonard Erickson, who wrote an article indepentent from me, and
another note that told me that what I had interpreted as serial
numbers really was fakenet numbers. (But the Boss node should filter
those numbers from the rest of fidonet, not insert them into the
nodelist!) The handling of fakenets in the nodelist seems to be a
result of a lazy programmer!

In this article I am discussing the combination of different nodelist
flags. Some combinations aren't useful, and others are more or less
confusing.  Those flag combinations are probably occuring due to
people that aren't aware about which flags that needs to be in the
nodelist, and which flags that are wasting space.  I think that some
RC:s and NC:s needs to check their part of the nodelist in some way to
make it cleaner.

I have added another waste of space in the end of this article with
all the more or less peculiar combinations of flags that exists in the
nodelist. Observe that I have sorted the fields in the nodelist to be
able to count all combinations correctly. Some combinations are much
more common than others. 9600 as an alone flag is used by many nodes.
Don't they know what their modem is up to, or is V32 said to be
default for those nodes?

I haven't written a word about the error lines in the nodelist until
now, but if a node is listed with an error in the nodelist, it should
be obvious for the node itself that it is something wrong!

The bad thing with those articles is that there will probably be some
large nodediffs in the coming weeks, but that's a problem that we
would have had anyway.

This is probably the last article about this subject for a while.

Below is some notes that you should have in mind when reading the list
of odd flags:

FidoNews 9-52                  Page 5                      28 Dec 1992


 - It is possible to combine the PEP and HST protocol on the same
   line if you hook them up with the HST modem breaking the line
   for the PEP modem, since the PEP modem has often a very long
   answer sequence for the PEP protocol, which will stay up even
   when the HST modem has put on the hook. I haven't tested this
   in real life yet, but I don't think that this should be hard to
   get working if it is possible to use two communication ports
   on the computer.

 - Some entries doesn't have many flags, often fewer than expected,
   very often only the baudrate.

 - A modem with V32B can always handle V32, so stating both flags
   is a true waste of space. This is also mentioned in the nodelist!

(Included part of Z2 nodelist here.)
..............................
      NOTE:  Many V22 modems also support Bell 212A.

      If no modem flag is given, CCITT V.22 is assumed within zone 2
      for 1200bps, while Bell 212A is assumed for 1200 bps systems in
      other zones, CCITT V22bis is assumed for 2400 bps systems.

      A separate modem capability flag should not be used when it can be
      determined by the modem flag.  For instance, a modem flag of HST
      implies MNP. V32B implies V32 and V42B implies V42. MNP,HST and
      V32,V32B and V42,V42B flag pairs are unnecessary.  H14 implies HST
      as well as V42.Bis and H16 implies H14.
..............................

Rather unusual!
===============
4800                              1

Hmmm.... I think that the maximum baud rate is a little too low.

Media Executive Rejected in bid for Zone Coordinator - Part II


Hello folks!

When we last left our saga, George Peace announced his
resignation as Zone 1 Coordinator effective Novmber 26, 1992,
and also announced that he wasn't gonna let ANYBODY that's not
a Region Coordinator (or WAS one) succeed him .

Well, here we are a month later, and we still have the status
quo. Peace is still in the nodelist as ZC, and the RCs still
can't agree on a replacement.

Maybe if the field of candidates weren't so LIMITED, they'd
have an easier time of it :)

You'll recall my previous Snooze article when I said that
the head honcho of the WOR Radio Network expressed an
interest in serving as Zone Coordinator, and was turned down
simply because he's not an RC. Hey, you may be a big a shot in
the national media, but in FIDONET, where things REALLY COUNT,
you are but a mere sysop; so you CAN'T be Zone Coordinator.
The NERVE of you to ask!

Well, this started a grass roots movement to get Rich Wood
("RadioMan") elected Z1C. He's garnered support from lots of
OTHER people that don't count (the sysops), and has decided
not to give in until SYSOPS in Fidonet have the RIGHT to seek
ANY coordinator position, VOTE for who their coordinators are,
and NOT be discriminated against in ANY fashion. Way to go
RadioMan!!

But hey, watch out!! RadioMan is a DEMOCRACY FREAK! Geez, he
wants to make coordinators ACCOUNTABLE to the people they
serve. We can't have THIS, can we?? Heaven help us, what
next ...

But I *DO* want to warn you lowly sysops about WHERE you
voice your opinion on this issue! *I* just received the
dubious honor of being cut from the ZEC conference for
discussion ZC elections! They said it was off-topic. Funny,
the last TWO Zone Echo Coordinators were APPOINTED (oops,
there we go with that appointment stuff again!) by the ZC, so
I'd think there'd be a pretty CLOSE RELATIONSHIP there, don't
you?? Don't matter though ...

FidoNews 9-52                  Page 8                      28 Dec 1992


Me, and another famous Big Mouth, Bob Moravsik, were yanked
from the conference by JOHN SOUVESTRE. Souvestre claims he's
the moderator of the ZEC conference, and has the authority to
throw us out.

Ok. We checked the OFFICIAL ECHOLIST at 1/201. Guess what?
John Souvestre isn't listed as the moderator! So we
challenged him, and he said he's the moderator because Marge
Robbins wasn't feeling well, and she asked him to fill in for
her while she was incapacitated.

Ok. We checked the OFFICIAL ECHOLIST at 1/201. Guess what?
MARGE ROBBINS isn't listed as the moderator EITHER! So we
asked Marge. Marge says "Oh that's a mistake. I really AM the
moderator". WILL THE *REAL* MODERATOR PLEASE STAND UP??!

Hehehe. Comical ain't it, folks?

It gets better.

This guy Souvestre wrote to an echomail coordinator in net
2605, and told him to cut Moravsik's link. That coordinator,
Tom Lawrence, asked why he should do that.

John Souvestre told Tom that he had NO AUTHORITY to ask that
question, and that he must cut Bob's link because he SAID SO.
Tom told him to GO POUND SALT. Souvestre went after Tom's
link, and the coordinator at the next level told him to GO
POUND SALT.

So Johnny went BOPping up the line until he found SOMEBODY
that would do what he tells him, and a link was FINALLY cut!

So me, Bob, and EIGHTY EIGHT SYSOPS got their link cut,
because this guy Souvestre says that HE'S THE BOSS AND YOU
WILL DO AS I SAY.

Hey, why not make this Souvestre guy Z1C?? That's the kind of
guy we want, right?? A total dictator that admits it! Yeah!!!

Hey look, this is just an example of what SOME people will do
to squash the average Joe who wants to have SOME say in how
his network is run. The ZEC conference is supposed to be
moderated by the ZEC, and THAT guy is appointed by the ZC!
BUT ITS OFF-TOPIC!! Don't you DARE bring it up in there.
Hehehehehe!!

Oh, by the way, we don't HAVE a ZEC at the moment. The last
one resigned. So does that mean that there's ANY moderator
for the ZEC conference?

Anyway, the REASON Rich Wood enjoys popular support, is because
HE supports checks and balances so that people like Souvestre
can't go on a rampage like this unchecked. People like that
MUST be held accountable to the rank and file.

Hey we even got the "Rich Wood for ZC" word out all over the
WORLD! Yep, its even in the January 12, 1993 edition of PC
Magazine.

Don't believe me? Look closely at the screen shot on Page
55 :)

Anyway, a bunch of us sysops-rights nuts will be submitting a
policy document in mid to late January to the RCs for approval
by the members of Fidonet. I'll bet it even actually gets
presented for ratification! If it does, it'll be a GOOD THING
for Fidonet. People like Rich Wood, and people like YOU will
be allowed to seek any coordinator position regardless of your
current status, and it'll give you the *RIGHT* to VOTE.

Rich Wood for ZC = Democracy in Fidonet.

Hey what do you think? Drop me a note! Drop Rich a note! Drop
your RC a note! Until next time ....

* Policy4, *C Elections, & You

POLICY4, *C ELECTIONS & YOU
by Mark Jordan, 1:205/1701

And so it comes to this...secrecy, clandestine affairs, hidden
information in the NODEDIFF...

If I wasn't looking for certain things (more later) in the NODEDIFF, I
never would have known that there was a problem in the ZC election...
of course, now that Region 10 is apparently going to control the new
selection process, I should also be happy for those up the line to be
looking out for my best interests, no?

Never mind that Policy4 complaints took forever to be processed...never
mind the admission in a police report by the sysop who was subject of
the PC...never mind that even though Policy4 *specifically* states that
precedent is useful but not binding, but the *C structure is 'afraid of
setting a precedent', even when POLICY supersedes precedent...never
mind that we are told that Policy4 is binding on Zone 1...
this all part of the 'more later' from above...

FidoNews 9-52                  Page 10                     28 Dec 1992


Now, those who have decided on how to control the process of choosing
candidates admit that they have had a problem!  Perhaps this problem
is founded in the 'creativity' of their *new* interpretation on how
Policy4 is to be made, no?

I, for one, would be very interested in hearing about how this new
'selection of candidates' process came about...what authority decided
that this was going to be the way to do it---and what authority has now
decided to abandon that process for another, one which is coming from
a structure that is, in my own experience, both painfully slow and
inexorably petrified so badly, it can't realize it's own problems fast
enough.

As much as I am for the ideals of Policy4, I am afraid that the time
has come to state what no one else has been willing to do...

POLICY4 is toothless.  It is ineffective.  It is these things because it
is *NOT* a valid policy controlling Fidonet.  It is observed by the *C
structure only when it is convenient---it is ignored when those it is
designed to protect ask for its solace.  It is being used as a shield
to protect those in power, and allow them justification to both abuse
and exceed the very limited authority that it grants them.  Even when
a precedent exists, it is ignored; when one doesn't exist to guide in
a decision, no one in the *C structure is willing to make one.

It is time for some sort of action to take place, whether it is to give
up and leave Fidonet, or to wrest control back from the current
by means of a coup...up to and including issuing a nodelist independent
of the current *C structure.

Face it, folks...we are a grass-roots organization, right?  We do this
for love and communications, not power or money, right?  We do this all
because we wish to communicate freely and openly, and make our world
available to everyone else to share in, right?

So, tell me, then---why is it that the ZC selection process was closed
to anyone except former or current RCs?  Why is it that RCs now have
the power to *appoint* a NC?

If Policy outweighs precedents in Fidonet, what are these 'processes'
from, and on what authority?

So, I ask openly and honestly, to all the *C and *EC structure---

Please explain yourselves.  Please cite the authority you suddenly have
granted yourselves.  Please show us why you are doing this, and on what
grounds you have exempted yourself from, at the least, openly advising
the sysops-at-large of your actions, whether (as Tom Jennings himself
has asked) in the official news-organ of Fidonet or at least bulletins
for the NC/NEC structure to send out, rather than leaving it in the
NODEDIFF, where automatic list processors never even realize it is on
the file!

There are enough people I've contacted or been contacted by in Fidonet
who are not at all pleased with this heavy-handed display of
authority...and I truly have no interest in Fido Politics beyond
running my system and keeping my users happy.

But when your actions coddle those who would violate my system and my
privacy; when you begin changing the organization to suit what seem to
be naught but personal goals; when the subjective outweighs the
objective; when you begin the process to interfere with my enjoyment
of being part of Fidonet, I *demand* answers.

                 A FEW OBSERVATIONS ON HOBBY GROUP DYNAMICS
                                   by
                        Kay Shapero @ 1:102/524

Recent events in Fidonet in general and FidoNews in particular suggest
the following, while originally meant for a different audience might
be of some use.  Accordingly, here follows a short dissertation on
relatively small group dynamics from a somewhat anthropological view,
based on personal observations of such phenomena including various
literary fandoms, college organizations, gaming clubs, and computer
nets.

Specifically, I want to talk about what may be described as
subcultures, or hobby groups - groups of individuals bound together by
a common interest or theme, in which membership is voluntary.  Such
things as chess and bridge leagues, folk dancing clubs, the Society
for Creative Anachronism, ham radio clubs or the various nets and
zones of FIDOnet.  This as opposed to cultural enclaves, where members
from a completely different culture can be found living inside of the
territory of another culture but paying as little heed as possible to
the imperatives of the other culture, or ghettoization where members
of a particular culture are forced into a subculture by some
characteristic or characteristics which are seen by the larger culture
as forming an obvious bond, and as being strange at best, unsavory at
worst.

Now there are all sorts of motives for joining a hobby group, but they
can be divided rather loosely into four categories
(1) intrinsic interest in the theme,
(2) social (a friend or mate is part of the group),
(3) political (membership in the group may be of help to achieve ends in
the larger culture), and sometimes
(4) out and out power seeking; the search for a small enough pond in
which one can be a large frog.  Now these motives are not exclusive and
frequently members can be found who embody several of them.  But one
thing seems clear - members whose motives fall entirely, or nearly
entirely into one category frequently cannot understand, or even
recognize the motives of those of another which they do not share.  We
shall now explore a few of the problems this can lead to...

FidoNews 9-52                  Page 12                     28 Dec 1992


With any hobby group in existence for less than a decade or so, people
primarily interested in the theme of the group predominate and include
many of the people who created the hobby group in the first place.  In
the case of FIDOnet, that would be the sysops of the original net
structure, and most of the ones who have joined over the succeeding
years.  If there are any recognized leaders at all, they are of the
first group, but unless there's some overwhelming reason for a rigid
formal structure, they tend to be somewhat anarchistic in nature,
especially when viewed from the outside, or by people primarily
motivated by power seeking (about which more later).  Every one of the
other categories at this point has potential dangers, some more than
others.

Folks with category two motives don't tend to linger unless they also
develop motives of one or more of the other types (case in point, the
girl/boyfriend of the wargaming enthusiast who comes to a few
sessions, is bored silly, and either breaks up with the player or
pries him/her away from the game) and unless they're particularly
vindictive, pose more of a nuisance than a threat. If they are, and
can't pry the friend/mate away from the hobby, they go forth and give
interviews of the "Golf ruined my life!" variety or go on talk shows
explaining why Dungeons and Dragons is a tool of Satan.  Which can do
bad things to your group's public image, which is why the smart group
does not simply ignore folks who drifted in for category two reasons;
it tries to find something to interest them instead while the primary
member is doing whatever it is the club does.  If possible - in the
case of something like FIDOnet benign neglect probably IS the way to
go, for anybody further away from the social member than their local
sysop.

Category three motives are relatively rare in a new group (one less
than 10 or so years old, such as FIDOnet) unless the other members are
politically important already.  For example, a golf club started by
professional movie makers might well attract wannabe actors; a fishing
league begun by Congressmen might attract anyone who wants to
influence one.  Sometimes what the lions are famous for may be the
same thing as what the hobby group deals with, such as famous authors
starting a writing club.  In any case, if the group and the fame are
for two different things, category three motives cause folks to act
much like those of category two, while if they're the same thing they
may well resemble those of category one.  Herein lies the danger; in
their efforts to be noticed by the "big guns", lion hunters can do
some pretty strange things and not all realize just how far it is safe
to go.  So you get the "fan from hell" syndrome, and before long all
the "big guns" may be forgiven for an assumption that the average
individual who is in the hobby purely for the fun of it must also be a
"fan from hell".  This upsets no end of people, and again can really
wreck the image of your hobby group.  (Comics fandom is a prime
example.)

OK, here we go with category four...  This motive can be of immense
value, or prove a serious nuisance.  First off, people who are
attempting to find power in a small group because they cannot achieve
the power over others they desire in the outside world for reasons
OTHER than lack of competence, _and_ are interested in the intrinsic
nature of the group (category one), or are at least not bored with the
FidoNews 9-52                  Page 13                     28 Dec 1992


topic frequently prove serious assets to the group.  Witness the
caliber of staff many a volunteer charity club has gained in the past
from people who for reasons of sex, age, or race were actively
prevented from wielding any authority.  A true benevolent dictatorship
can be wonderful for keeping the rest of the world out of the hair of
the vast majority of the club (category one) while they enjoy their
hobby.  After all, one gets enough aggravation in the "real world",
and despite rumor, most folks who partake in any hobby, be it bridge,
little theater, the Society for Creative Anachronism, or FIDONet  DO
"have a life" besides their favorite pastime.

The real trouble comes when you get someone who is either not QUITE
competent to run even a small group, or otherwise potentially
competent, but just plain too self centered to take into consideration
the feelings of the other members of the group.  It is from THIS
category that most direct challenges to the original leadership of the
hobby group tend to come.  And this confuses the heck out of the
category one motivated folks, who can't understand why this newbie
seems to think that they are running some sort of Horrible
Dictatorship.  It's actually fairly easy to take the leadership away
from someone who doesn't really want it in the first place.  Which
means you can wind up with someone nominally in charge who doesn't
quite know what he is doing, and worse, is unaware of this fact.  This
doesn't necessarily mean disaster, if the newbie is willing to learn.
If, however, he isn't, doesn't realize he simply doesn't know
everything he thinks he does, and is also of the mindset that assumes
that all people everywhere are primarily actuated by power seeking,
and that all actions must be explained in that light, Katy bar the
door!  As soon as it becomes obvious that the group is not running in
the style in which either it did, or in which the category four
motivated leader WANTS it to, the search is on for the political enemy
who must be trying to take the group away from it's rightful king..er
leader.  If the new leader is the only power seeker, this can damp
down pretty quickly once everyone else appoints him designated twit
and ignores him.  But if there are any others about THEY will all
promptly start attempting to seize power and SAVE THE CLUB/ECHO/NET.
At this point your best bet is to sneak out the back, lock the door,
tiptoe off down the street and start a new group...

Continuing on, let us consider power struggles and power seeking in a
bit more depth.  One classic way to gain power in a small group
setting, is to find one or more other people who agree with your
opinions, and start up a clique.  For examples of this, consider the
stereotypical handful of highschool kids (as seen in everything from
the movie "Heathers", to a recent Dinosaurs episode) who set up the
"in group", in which members must wear the "right" clothes, go the
"right" places, shop the "right" stores, and think the "right"
thoughts.  Now most folks have a small group of friends with whom they
are comfortable and have fairly similar outlooks, but in a classic
clique, conversation among the "in group" tends to focus on the (vital
to it's existence) "out group" and why they are "out".  With one of
these cliques found within a hobby group, discussion between the core
members and their hangers-on may consist heavily of what's wrong with
the hobby group, which, however it's stated REALLY boils down to the
fact that includes the "out group".  All members of the "in group" are
of course constantly reinforced in their opinions of the "out group"
FidoNews 9-52                  Page 14                     28 Dec 1992


by sheer repetition.  (You now know why I avoid "war boards".  But I
digress.)

Mind you, the opinions are not stated directly as "they're not like
US", but usually follow characteristics that exist OR ARE ASSUMED TO
EXIST in the "out group".  The net result, should the clique be left
alone for awhile, can be a lot like a cyclotron - let's take an
example from a writer's club, and a clique within the club.  Round one
- Individual one: "That guy puts too much sex in his stories."
Individual two: Y'know, you're right - that guy is practically writing
pornography.", "Individual three: "Yeah, I never did like that guy's
writing."  Wait two days while individual one talks to individual
four, individual two talks to individual five, individual three talks
to individual six.  Round two - Individual two: "That guy's latest
story is a bit steamy don't you think?"  Individual four :"Yeah, I
heard somewhere that he writes pornography on the side."  Individual
three: "Hey, that's just what I heard too!"

Keep this up for a few more rounds and you'll have all parties firmly
convinced that the guy in question is a professional pornographer, and
that EVERYBODY knows it.

Mind you, this can happen by accident - if someone's TRYING to do that
it can get even worse.  Especially if he decides that the only way to
get control is to convince everyone else in the whole hobby that
they're all in Terrible Danger from the Outside and only following His
Plans will Save The Hobby From Destruction.  And figures out the
easiest way to do this is to create rumors about the hobby group in
the next cultural group up the stack (aka "the outside world" usually,
though this phenomenon is even more concentrated in hobby subgroups -
say a local net vs FIDOnet, or a local bbs vs the local net) and about
how horrible it is because of certain factors and people, then tell
everyone to clean up their act so the outsiders will not think bad
things about them any more.  Mind you, this almost never works - what
this approach usually does is, if sufficiently successful, kill off
the group.  I've seen it happen.

The fact is, like it or not, there are really not that many, if any
positions of real power in FIDOnet.  Essentially everything we do
depends on the willing cooperation of others.  This will not change
regardless of who is theoretically "in charge".  So, like the
proverbial dog who chased cars, I would suggest that the Man (or
Woman) Who Would Be King, first SERIOUSLY consider what you mean to do
with your objective if you achieve it.  And remember - the more people
you annoy on the way up, the higher the probability that if you reach
the top at all, you will find that the entire pyramid has shifted out
from underneath you...

I'm a do nothing, nobody sysop in a small town outside Houston, Tx. I
never say much about anything that FidoNet does or doesn't do.

I'm writing this article in hopes that other dead sysops will rise
up from the terminals and type the ZC's and RC's out of FidoNEWS.
The news for the past several months has been about this zone or that
zone that has a problem with their own people. Who CARES! Let's get
back to what's new(s) in FidoNet. I personally don't care if the Zar
of Russia or the Pope is the ZC of any area and whether or not the ZC
is practicing Spanish Inquisition techniques on the sysops of his
zone. I have my own problems with our little world in 1:106.
Which by the there aren't many unless you count changing your feed
node which is not a problem just an inconveniance. Thanks Bob! You
kept our area clean of the stains and dirt that refuse to cleaned
by sysops unwilling to do their own laundry.

I miss the days when I could sit back and read the newsletter
(FidoNews) and hear about new programs and hardware available to help
me in my quest for the perfect system to operate my BBS and Echomail.
What happened to the articles on the latest versions available
software for echomail processing? Where's the articles about happy
times in Sysop Land? Why are the typed lines of great minds missing
from my news? The insightful docu-dramas of a life in the day of a
sysop from Tim-Buck-Two were always delightful and interesting. The
humorous looks at life from the little guy is always more pleasing
than the gripes and groans from the dis-satisfied.

So to that end I have written this piece in hopes that sysops every-
where will submit an article about what's new or interesting in their
life and not what's bad about FidoNet and it's RULERS!

If this ever gets to press then I'm sure that I'll write an article
about how my 6 year old gets mail through FidoNet, and how I have to
read it to her and type her replies for her or maybe I'll write
how I got my e-mail on horse back while riding on the Salt Grass
Trail Ride in the Houston Livestock and Rodeo. Heck, I might even
tell you how to get your spouse to allow you an extra hour of computer
time to devote to FidoNews articles.

Happy Holidays! May all your news be good news!

Announcing the release of NoSnail - Netmail for RBBS-PC v1.00

NoSnail - Netmail for RBBS v1.00 allows RBBS sysops to give outbound
routed netmail access to their users.  NoSnail does this by making
use of an emerging standardized kludge in the Fidonet community by
looking to line one of the message text for addressing. As usual
NoSnail is shared with the RBBS community FREE of charge.

New goodies in the 1.00 release of NoSnail: (NOSN100.ZIP)

[]Support for the *.MSG format for D'Bridge/Frontdoor/Intermail users
(NoSnail always has supported BinkleyTerm)

[]Support for BinkleyTerm's .BSY flags

[]Support for BinkleyTerm's 4D sub-directories

[]Support for the emerging netmail standard for QWK packets by moving
  addressing from the SUBJECT file to LINE ONE (1) of the text of the
  message.  This standard is currently supported by MAXIMUS BBS and
  the OFFLINE QWK reader.

[]Fixed ElvisMode problem

[]Fixed MsgID problem

[]Fixed limitation of paths in NOSNAIL.CFG

NoSnail has been delivered to a SDSRBBS node for distribution so be
on the lookout at your favorite FileBone location.

Additionally, NoSnail has been uploaded to Simtel20.Army.Mil for
those enjoying Internet FTP access.  Look for NoSnail in the RBBS-PC
directory. (cd pd1:<msdos.rbbs-pc> from the prompt)

Finally, NOSN100.ZIP may be file requested by from my origin at
v.32bis speeds the usual 23 hours a day.  Magic name of NOSNAIL
also yields the most recent release of NoSnail.  One could also
logon as NOSNAIL LATEST with a password of VERSION and gain access
to my personal files directory. (318-255-4710)

Note:  Given the holiday season it may be a few days before those
who do the honors of moving files into SDSRBBS and into Internet
are able to accommodate us.

Strange but I can't remember if I mentioned this program here or not
sometime in the past. The doctor cured the voices yet, sadly, had to
remove quite a bit of brain to do so. Ah well... Nothing is perfect.

Remote Access Users and SysOps can send and recieve Internet Mail
easy enough. Indeed, if you didn't know it, anyone can send and recieve
Internet mail simply by finding a UUCP Gateway system as defined by
the UUCP nodelist flag. Messages addressed to 'uucp' sent to these
Gates will be set to the Internet User defined after a 'to:' kludge
in the message text.

UUCP-RA.LZH doesn't talk to UUCP systems directly. It works _with_
the UUCP nodes defined in the nodelist. That's important to remember
because I _will_ have a program which will gate Remote Access directly
to UUCP using the FredMail specifications. (When that's ready, I'll
let everyone know. It would be great to hear from people who are
interested in that project now, though.)

o The inbound network mail directory is scanned for mail which has
  'UUCP' as the 'From' person. Inbound mail from Internet should
  always be marked as 'From: UUCP.'

o Messages found from UUCP are moved to a special Remote Access Folder
  and either killed or marked as having been moved. The mark is done
  by having a . put in front of the 'subject' line.

o The specified destination Remote Access Users name is pulled from
  the inbound Internet Mail and UUCP-RA.LZH addresses the mail to
  that individual, allowing the Remote Access User to be shown a list
  of mail waiting for him or her when they sign in.

When all that's done, the reverse process is entertained.

o The Remote Access Message Base is scanned for Unmoved Echo Messages
  in the Internet Mail Folder you specify. It looks for messages
  which are address to: UUCP.

o *.MSG type files are created in the outbound network mail
  directory. They are marked as 'Local,' 'Kill after sending,' and
  as 'Crash.' An option in the configuration allows them to be
  marked as 'Hold for pick-up' as well.

o The FidoNet kludges are applied and an Internet-Type Origin line
  block is appended to each outbound Internet message.

Logging is done if desired and a bunch of other stuff. There are things
done if there are exceptions. If there is no to: kludge in the outbound
Internet mail, for instance, the software will mark it as having been
moved from Remote Access and it will put a "TO: ADDRESS MISSING" comment
in the subject of the message, then readdress the message back to the
User so that the Remote Access User will know that s/he forgot to include
the Internet address.

BTW: It also will scan the nodelist for you (if asked) for UUCP nodes.
The /list command will search for those in the network that your
system is in (configured) and /listall will list all UUCP nodes that
are in the nodelist.

The source code is included as usual. This is at version 1.2, as I
recall, and after it's been downloaded at least once, I'll start to
incriment the version number as updates are made to the package. If
you spot anything unusual or need changes made to this project, please
let me know and I'll make whatever changes are needed.

BTWAGAIN: If you need information on Internet <==> FidoNet gateways,
you can FileRequest UFGHOW.ZIP from my system or 1:102/851.0 and
several others. Or you can ask me.
