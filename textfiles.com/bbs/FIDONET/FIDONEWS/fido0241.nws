                                 Freeware, Again

          Yes, I'm beating the drum for freeware, yet again.

          Do you have any idea what it takes to bring a product to the
          market?  Never mind the "expensive cost of copy protection".
          That just adds to the software development.  Reproducing  it
          is very cheap.

          Far and away,  the major cost of marketing anything  is  the
          so-called  "marketing  costs".  It costs,  roughly speaking,
          about a metric ton  of  dollars  to  get  anything  on  your
          dealers' shelves and suitably advertised so that anyone will
          buy it.

          Put yourself in the store owner's shoes for a moment.  Shelf
          space is money.  Why waste that on  a  product  which  won't
          sell?  This  is  why  your  local  store  has such a limited
          selection -- he's only going to carry things  which  have  a
          good chance of being sold with the machine.  This is why the
          software market peaks and slumps with the hardware market.

          In  addition,  most  distributors  don't want to waste their
          time with a  product  which  doesn't  have  a  proven  track
          record.  Why  should they?  It costs money to stock an item;
          why spend that money on an item which isn't a proven seller?

          So how does a new author enter the  market?  If  nobody  has
          ever  heard  of you,  then you obviously don't have a proven
          track record,  and why should anyone gamble their  money  on
          you?

          One  alternative  is to start by advertising and go for mail
          or phone order sales first.  Then you can prove your product
          before asking people to gamble on it.  But that costs money.
          Call up any trade journal and ask; advertising is EXPENSIVE!

          Another approach is freeware.  Anybody  at  all  can  market
          anything  at all as freeware.  No initial capital investment
          is required.  Just put a freeware license in the code  (copy
          it from almost anywhere) and you're off!

          This  allows  truly  cheap  software.  The bulk of the costs
          (the marketing costs) are  totally  bypassed.  In  addition,
          anyone can do it.  As a final plus (as if we needed it), the
          end  user  gets to try out the software in actual pratice to
          make sure that it really is what he needs and wants for  his
          own  particular  application.  If  everything really worked,
          then everyone would benefit.

          There's just  one  small  fly  in  the  ointment.  The  best
          estimates we've ever heard place freeware license compliance
          at   about   ten  percent.   Our  own  somewhat  pessimistic
          estimates put it down somewhere less than one percent.

          We had a user on our bulletin board who, in all seriousness,
          was  asking  for  a  definition  of  freeware,  specifically
          wondering  if his company (a major New York bank) should pay
          for it.  We told him thjat his company  could  not  credibly
          plead  poverty,  so  he  must.  But why was he asking in the
          first place?  This to me indicates  a  regrettable  lack  of
          understanding about what is really going on here.

          I see freeware licensing as  a  tacit  admission  that  copy
          protection  can't  really  be  enforced,   coupled  with  an
          ingenious  marketing  idea  that   woould   really   benefit
          everyone.  But  only  if  everyone is truly capable of being
          trusted to the extent that  freeware  authors  are  trusting
          their  users.  Let's  face  it,  if  you  are  still using a
          freeware package after  two  weeks,  then  it  is  obviously
          useful to you, and you should pay the fee.

          Are you are freeware pirate?

          J Hobbs
          Fido 104/56

          After reading an article by Paula Giese ( Nov 4, 1985 )
          which part of it discussed how GTE is selling Sysop's
          services, I thought I would give another opinion.

          First of all, I'm not a Sysop so my views may differ from
          those of you who are Sysops.  However I am a user of a lot
          of BBS's, most of them being various Fidos, both local and
          not so local.  I own a DEC Rainbow and unfortunately there
          are no local DEC Fidos.  I have to utilize a long distance
          carrier to get to a DEC Fido to obtain customized utilities
          that are created specifically for the DEC machines.
          (Perhaps you noticed the generic use of 'long distance
          carrier')

          If a Sysop runs a PUBLIC, SEMI-PUBLIC, or PRIVATE Fido (or
          other BBS) that I have access to, and I must use someone's
          service to access that bulletin board, why cannot the
          choice be the cheapest one.  Why should it matter to the
          Sysop if I use MCI, SPRINT, LDX, AT&T or GTE.  These are
          all large corporations that make big bucks, so why punish me
          (a single person, the PUBLIC who you are using Fido to
          service) to have to spend more money out of my pocket to
          gain access to a remote BBS. Currently I have not decided
          whether or not I am going to use another service other than
          AT&T because I have heard about problems with noise and bad
          lines.

          Granted the local users may call more often and have more to
          offer in the sence of uploads (since they are not paying $$$
          by the minute) but is not the purpose of BBS's to allow the
          FREE (or relatively free) exchange of ideas, comments and
          solution of problems? (A few games and other utilities are
          nice too!)   The few long distance callers a BBS may have
          probably don't last that long (because of the $$$) or occur
          that often.  But as in my case are necessary, utilities like
          SEDT (a very good full screen editor), AME86 (allows CPM
          .CMD programs to run under DOS), KERMIT, PACMAN and other
          games for my Rainbow are not available locally.

          I guess what it boils down to is this, if you are a Sysop
          and decide to run a PUBLIC Fido, and you voluntarily list
          your phone number for others to use, WE the PUBLIC (whether
          we live 5 or 5000 miles away) should have the right to use
          any long distance carrier WE desire to reach out and compute
          with someone.

          I have trouble understanding Paula Giese's reaction to
          Pc-Pursuit. I think it represents a great opportunity for
          most sysops. Here's why: It allows long distance users to
          join in the message sections (probably for the first time)

              All the sysops I know hate "board rapers". You know,the
          guy who logs on time after time and goes straight to the
          downloads without reading your new editorial or even
          scanning the message section. Face it, Most long distance
          callers can't afford the luxury of scanning and entering
          messages...it's just too costly..so by and large most long
          distance callers are in search of downloads.

             Enter PC-PURSUIT. For a measly $25 you can call any board
          in the 12 cities currently offering the service for up to an
          hour at a time. Now at last it's practical for long distance
          users to become active in the message sections and really
          start contributing.

            On Fido 123/4 we try to emphasize the message areas. Sure
          we have downloads, 12 file areas in fact but what makes the
          board thrive is the discussion and debates held in several
          of our message sections.

            Currently we are not in a city where PC-PURSUIT is
          available but I look forward to the day when we get it. I
          expect to pick up quite a few valuable users.

                          A CALL TO END THE THREAT OF WAR
                      Six World Leaders have spoken, issuing
          The Delhi Declaration of the Five Continent Peace Initiative
                       on January 28, 1985, saying in part:

          "Forty years ago,  when atomic bombs were blasted over Hiro-
          shima  and  Nagasaki,  the human race became aware  that  it
          could destroy itself...

          "We  find  ourselves in this situation because  the  nuclear
          weapons  states have applied traditional doctrines of a  war
          in a world where new weapons have made them obsolete.   What
          is the point of nuclear 'superiority' or 'balance' when each
          side  has  enough weapons to devastate the earth  dozens  of
          times over?  If the old doctrines are applied in the future,
          the  holocaust  will be inescapable sooner  or  later.   But
          nuclear  war can be prevented if our voices are joined in  a
          universal demand in defense of our right to live.

          "It is imperative to find a remedy to the existing situation
          where hundreds of billions of dollars,  amounting to approx-
          imately one and a half million per minute, are spent annual-
          ly  on  weapons.   This stands in dramatic contrast  to  the
          poverty,  and  in some cases misery,  in which two-thirds of
          the world population lives.

          "We urge the people,  parliaments and governments the  world
          over  to lend forceful support to this appeal...  Only  then
          will  governments  summon  the necessary political  will  to
          overcome the many obstacles which lie in the path of peace.

          "For centuries,  men and women have fought for their  rights
          and freedoms.  We now face the greatest struggle of all--for
          the right to live, for ourselves and for future generations.

                        PC Pursuit for the Uninitiated

          With all of the articles in  FidoNews lately,  there appears
          to be some misunderstanding of what PC Pursuit is and  does.

          As an active user of  PC Pursuit,  I'd  like  to  take  this
          opportunity to explain a little bit about what PC Pursuit is
          and  what it means to sysops and users  alike.  The issue of
          GTE's  compensation  to  Tom Jennings  has  been  adequately
          discussed in (many) other articles,  so I won't  discuss  it
          here.

          PC Pursuit allows  "Free"  access  to 300 and 1200 baud data
          numbers  from and  to many  numbers in  12 citys in the  US.
          If  you don't live within the local  calling area of one  of
          these citys,  PC Pursuit  cannot  benefit  you (nor  can  it
          exploit you).

          If  you  do live within a local call of one of these cities,
          PC Pursuit presents an excellent opportunity for you to take
          advantage of  low-cost  calling to the other areas supported
          by the service,  and  if  you  are a  sysop  (of any kind of
          board), will provide  you  with many new users from all over
          the country.

          If you are a Fido sysop in an enterprising network in one of
          these areas,  you  might find an even greater benefit:  free
          mail  to and from  other  networks in  PC Pursuit  supported
          areas.

          To use PC Pursuit to place calls,  you  need to subscribe to
          the service. The cost (as of this writing) is $25 per month,
          and  a one time $25 installation fee.  This  entitles you to
          place   calls  through  the  service   during  evenings  and
          weekends. The only limit is 60 minutes per call, but you can
          place as many 60 minute calls as you like,  even if they are
          all to the same number.

          Once set up, to use the service you simply call the local PC
          Pursuit  phone  number,  and give it your phone number,  the
          name of the city that you wish to call,  and  the number you
          wish to call. PC Pursuit will then disconnect.

          You must set your modem/comm package to autoanswer, and from
          one  to  five  minutes after you place the call,  PC Pursuit
          will  call YOU,  and  attempt  to  place  your  call.  After
          thrashing  around  with the  internals  of Telenet for a few
          minutes,  PC Pursuit will call the requested number.  If the
          number doesn't answer,  it will disconnect after two  tries.
          If the number is busy,  Pursuit will retry for approximately
          10 minutes.  Otherwise,  if  it  can  make a connection,  it
          announces that you are connected, and you are on your own.

          As  a  sysop,  to  get callers via PC Pursuit,  you  need do


          Fidonews                   Page  8               25 Nov 1985





          nothing.  In  fact,  they  will  come  to  you  whether  you
          encourage  them   or  not.      A   PC  Pursuit  caller   is
          indistiguishable  from  any other caller. If you do not care
          for long distance users,  or wish to keep the board open for
          your regulars during evening hours,  you  can  simply follow
          Tom Jennings' example,  and  not allow new callers during PC
          Pursuit hours.

          In  order  to get free fidomail via PC Pursuit,  you need to
          either be willing to do the work involved in  setting up the
          facilities, or have someone else in your net do the work and
          provide it to the rest.  In our net,  net 124,  we have been
          lucky enough to have someone who has been willing to do  the
          work  and  share it with the rest of us.  The same thing has
          happened in San Francisco Bay Net, Net 125, and I'm sure has
          happened or will happen in other places.  The details of how
          this is done will vary from net to net, but in our net it is
          completely  transparent  to those not directly participating
          in the project.  We simply set the price to $00.00, and send
          the mail.  Once  it  is routed to the host,  it is re-routed
          through the "Pursuit Net" and is gone.

          Using PC Pursuit  is  not without it's irritations.  Telenet
          causes delays in the line,  and sometimes the echo back from
          the board at the other end will fall behind your typing, but
          the  effect is not as  pronounced as I  have  seen  on  some
          boards which are multitasked.

          Having to use the "place a call - get a call back" system is
          frustrating as well, but this is a blessing to users who pay
          metered charges for local calls - you only have to pay for a
          one  minute  local call.  Inventive  use of script files and
          command files in  CrossTalk and  ProComm 2.0 make short work
          of the details involved in placing calls through PC Pursuit.

          Other  irritations are relatively minor.  PC Pursuit  places
          the  call  back at the same speed  and  parity that you used
          calling  in.  This  wouldn't  be a  problem,  except that PC
          Pursuit wants  7 bit even parity for your  call in,  and  we
          know how well protocals like XMODEM like that. To get around
          this,  one  can  simply call at 8/N/1  and  PC  Pursuit will
          synchonize after your first few lines of input.  After using
          it a few times,  you  know what the prompts are anyway,  and
          it's relatively easy to live with garbaged prompts.

          Shortcomings  to the service at this point include a lack of
          2400 baud service,  and limited access  to  area codes other
          than the primary area code in many cities. GTE has indicated
          that it will address both of these problems around the first
          of the year.

          That, in a nutshell, is what PC Pursuit is all about. It has
          it's problems,  but  it  is as much bang for your  telephone
          buck that is available at the moment.  I  easily spent three
          to four times  the  monthly fee placing calls through Sprint
          or MCI before I started using PC Pursuit.

          From:    David Drexler/Mark Grennan, sysops REMARK 19/202
          Subject: R.O.A.P.: Reach Out And Play
          Date:    20 NOV 85

          Are there any Go players in the crowd?  Have you ever  tried
          to play a game by mail?  It's pretty hard to keep your moti-
          vation  up,  since there may be many hundreds of moves in  a
          typical  game,  and even if the turnaround is only 24 hours,
          that works out to be a VERY long time...

          I  had  an  idea awhile back for  playing  long-distance  Go
          without  overly  enriching Mother Bell in  the  process.  It
          involved a couple of pc's & modems at each end (of  course),
          and two cooperative amateur radio operators in the middle.

          The pc's would run a specialized communications program that
          could also plot the board graphically on screen and printer,
          verify the moves,  store them, take them off the board, etc.
          Multiple  games could be conducted at the same time by  pre-
          fixing each move transmitted with an identifying header.  It
          seemed possible to hold remote tournaments that way.

          It never got off the ground.  Turned out to be more  trouble
          to  coordinate  all the events and people than I thought  it
          would be,  the program never got finished,  and everybody in
          my Go club lost interest.  The whole project was pushed into
          background  and  forgotten  -- until  last  night,  when  it
          occured to me that there was a much better alternative to Ma
          Bell than ham radio: Compuserve.

          Using "chat" mode, we could do everything that we were going
          to do with the hams,  do it anytime we wanted to,  and still
          for  minimal cost.  At 300 baud,  during the  "cheap"  time,
          it'll  cost only $6 per hour,  and two hours would be plenty
          enough  time to play a couple games.  With three players  at
          each end splitting the charge, it comes out to just a couple
          bucks apiece.

          But why stop at Go?  Why not Pente,  Chess,  Othello, or any
          other board game? All that's needed at each end is a program
          that  can  display the board and verify the  moves.  A  real
          smart program could handle several of those games.

          Comments, anyone?

          For the chess players out there who want to play by the more
          conventional move-at-a-time by mail,  feel free to drop us a
          line here. We promise to give you a strong game.

                        NEW VERSION OF SHUFFLE
                        ===-=======-==-=======

          Thanks to everyone for the overwhelming response I
          received to SHUFFLE.   I have just released a significant
          upgrade.

          SHUFFLE is a Fido sysop utility for maintaining download
          file areas.   Files and corresponding FILES.BBS entries can
          be redirected among directories.

          Version 2.0 supports full-screen operation and a host of new
          features.  FILES.BBS entries can be redirected to specific
          points in the destination FILES.BBS.  File dates can be
          changed and can be automatically added to FILES.BBS.
          Remote full screen sessions are supported under PibTerm,
          ProComm, Mintel, and FANSI-console.   A generic MS-DOS
          version is now under test.

          You can get the current version of SHUFFLE by calling
          Met-Chem BBS, Fido 16/42, at 203/281-7287.

          Thanks,

                         FidoNet Route Files Explained
                        Part 4 -- LISTGEN and ROUTE.CTL

                           by Ben Baker, Fido 100/76


               LISTGEN  Version  2  will  automatically generate route
          files for you if you desire.  The advantage is that  LISTGEN
          is driven by a control file, ROUTE.CTL, in which you specify
          the statements necessary with symbolic parameters  that  you
          define  in  terms  of  nets,  area  codes, etc..  A properly
          designed ROUTE.CTL need only change when your routing  needs
          change.  LISTGEN will continue to create correct route files
          week after week as the nodelist changes.

               Before I begin, I'd like to do a quick  review  of  the
          route file commands and their effect.

          SCHEDULE <tag> <list> or
          SEND-TO <list>               Determines which nodes may have
                                       packets build to SEND mail to.
          ROUTE-TO <target> <list>     Directs that messages  to  par-
                                       ticular  addressees  be SENT in
                                       packets to another node.
          ACCEPT-FROM <list>           Specifies  which   oritinators'
                                       messages may be SENT.
          RECV-ONLY                    States that packets may only be
                                       SENT by being picked up.
          HOLD <list>                  States that  packets  to  part-
                                       icular  nodes  may only be SENT
                                       by being picked up.
          PICK-UP <list>               States that it is OK to receive
                                       mail from particular nodes when
                                       we originate calls to SEND them
                                       packets.
          POLL <list>                  Directs that packets (empty  if
                                       necessary)   be  generated  and
                                       SENT  to  particular  nodes  in
                                       order to pick up mail.
          SEND-ONLY                    States  that  calls may be made
                                       rapid-fire  to  SEND  as   many
                                       packets as possible.

               Note that each definition above includes the verb  SEND
          or  SENT.   I  did that deliberately to emphasize that these
          commands all control some aspect of sending mail.

               LISTGEN has been adaquately documented  and  I  do  not
          intend  to re-document it here, but I would like to show you
          how ROUTE.CTL  commands  map  to  the  ROUTE.<tag>  commands
          covered above.

          SCHEDULE <tag> <target list>



          Fidonews                   Page 13               25 Nov 1985





               When  LISTGEN  encounters  this command in ROUTE.CTL it
          does two things.  First it closes any route file it  may  be
          working  on  and  creates a new ROUTE.<tag> file for the new
          <tag>.  Then it generates  a  SCHEDULE  statement  from  the
          specifications   in   this  one  for  the  new  ROUTE.<tag>,
          expanding any symbolic parameters to lists of nodes from the
          nodelist.  In other words, it begins a new route file as you
          would expect it to by defining the <target list>.

          FROM <accept list>

               This phrase, when encountered, generates an ACCEPT-FROM
          statement.

          TO <addressee list> [ VIA <target> ]

               If  the VIA clause is present, this statement generates
          a  "ROUTE-TO  <target>  <addressee  list>."  Successive   TO
          phrases  without  VIA  clauses  accumulate  to make a larger
          <addressee list> until a VIA  clause  IS  found.   Then  the
          entire  list  is  routed to the <target>.  (I'm not entirely
          happy with this "feature," but that's the way it works.)  If
          no  VIA  clause  is  ever  found, the TO phrase generates no
          output at all!  It  does  serve  as  documentation  in  your
          ROUTE.CTL file, saying "I expect to be sending mail TO these
          nodes in this schedule."

               All of the other route file  commands  discussed  above
          map  one-for-one  in  the  same  format  from  ROUTE.CTL  to
          ROUTE.<tag>.

               The big advantage in using LISTGEN is to be able to use
          simple  symbols  which  it will translate into long lists of
          nodes.  To illustrate, net 100 spans two area codes, 314  in
          Missouri  and  618  in  Illinois.  To minimize the number of
          toll calls placed accross the Mississippi, I serve as "Metro
          East"  hub  to concentrate the Illinois traffic.  I have the
          following statements (among others) in my ROUTE.CTL file:

          define Metro-East as Net-100 except Area-314 ; Area 618
          define Outbound as 100/10
          define World as all except Metro-East
            *  *  *
          FROM Metro-East TO World VIA Outbound

               Nodes may come and go, both in our net and  across  the
          country,  and  these  statements  need  not change.  LISTGEN
          interprets them week after week and builds the  right  route
          files  every  time.   And in several months, if our outbound
          host should change making it necessary to change  ROUTE.CTL,
          I  can  look  at this and not have to say to myself "What on
          earth was I trying to do here?" It's all pretty obvious.

               Before I wrap it up, there are two important exceptions
          to  the things I have said.  First, schedule A is special in
          that the <target list> always is  the  entire  nodelist,  no
          matter  what  ROUTE.A  says.  For that reason, if you do any
          routing not defined by the node list, I recommend  that  you

          DO  NOT  USE SCHEDULE A.  For all other schedules, Fido does
          exactly what ROUTE.<tag> tells it to do  and  nothing  more.
          And  second,  ROUTE.BBS is a special route file that affects
          all schedules for which there are no ROUTE.<tag> files.  For
          that  reason,  I recommend that you FORGET YOU EVER HEARD OF
          ROUTE.BBS.  It'll cause more problems than it'll ever solve!

               So,  routing  can  get  pretty complex (just ask 'em in
          Southern California), but it doesn't need to be  complicated
          once  you  know  what the objective of each schedule is from
          your point of view, and what your Fido needs to do  to  meet
          those objectives.

               In  fact, it's pretty easy if you just remember the two
          points I have been hammering at you since we began:

               1) Route files control the way you send  messages,  not
          the  way you receive them.  Every command we discussed above
          controls some aspect of sending messages.  And.  .  .

               2) A particular route file only  affects  the  schedule
          with  the  matching  <tag>.   What you say in ROUTE.B has no
          bearing whatever on  schedule  C.   Each  schedule  must  be
          separately spelled out.

                         Need DEC Rainbow accessories.

          I have a DEC Rainbow 100 (old version) and would like to run
          Fido on it.  I also have a Microscience 10 MB Hard Disk.  Do
          any of you know of a controller that I could use with a
          ST506 hard disk?

          I also would like to run MS-DOS on the Rainbow.  Where is it
          available?

          Thanks in advance.  Please contact me at address below:

                                   Version 4.5

          We are pleased to announce the release of ARC  version  4.5.
          This   version  adds  compression  suppression  and  archive
          "freshening".  We've also changed our naming scheme  to  use
          .ARC  and  .$$$  instead of .BAK and .ARC,  which allows for
          more painless error recovery.  In case  of  an  error,  your
          original archive will be preserved with its original name.

          We  are  gratified  at the positive response you've shown to
          our little utility.  Thanks to you all for making ARC such a
          success.
