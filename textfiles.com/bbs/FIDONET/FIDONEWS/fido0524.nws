                  IDEAS FOR A NEW -AND BETTER- FIDONET
                       (Let's make some changes...)

            Time goes by, and FidoNet grows every day faster. I don't
     think that, when creating the Fido Bulletin Board System, Tom
     Jennings knew he was starting something this big.
            I have lately read some articles, where sysops express
     their discomformity regarding the way things are going right
     now, specially with IFNA.
            Some sysops chose to form another, parallel net (like
     Ryugen Fisher, for example), some others just expressed their
     disappointness, and/or moved away from the "BIG net".
            Trhu this article, I want to give your my opinion, and to
     present you a new idea, a new idea that also contains new
     concepts.
            From my point of view, DEMOCRACY (not a "new concept"!)
     doesn't exist on FidoNet. And when one of the basic things
     needed for a large group to survive is not present, it is likely
     to fall in an anarchy, where everyone does what he/she wants, no
     matter what.
            When you live in a country that has a democratic
     constitution since 1853, and that while democracy lasted was one
     of the most rich and one of the TEN worldpowers and when it lost
     democracy, went from being THE RICHEST in the world to one of
     the poorest (yes, Argentina was *the richest* country in the
     world after WW2, and please, don't ask how it is right now...),
     you learn how important democracy is, for something to survive.
            I think something MUST BE DONE in FidoNet, before it is
     "too late".
            The FidoNet nodelist has already 3000+ members, in all
     the 5 continents of the world, on about 30 countries. FidoNet
     has become a totally INTERNATIONAL network, rather than an
     "American one with some nodes overseas".
            One of the main purposes of this new concept is to
     prevent the desintegration of FidoNet, as well as to make the
     actual conditions (a lot) better.
            In Latin America we are just starting with the net. There
     is still a "familiar climate" within the net, and everybody
     cooperates with each other, but as we read some echomail
     conferences or FidoNews, we ask ourselves: "Is it gonna happen
     the same way down here? Are we working so hard just to get to
     that point?".
            What I want to propose is the following:
            One "FidoNet Association" is created for each of the 4
     zones (I'm assuming Latin America as Zone 4).
            Those associations may vary in their internal
     organization, since each zone's requirements and neccesities are
     very different.
            When they are finally established, each designates 3
     members to take part on the International FidoNet Council, that
     is finally formed by those 12 representants of the 4 zones.
     FidoNews 5-24                Page 2                   13 Jun 1988


            Each zone has the right to have the presidency of the
     Council for 6 months a year (each has the right to preside the
     council once every two years).
            The Council's president must be one of the 4
     representants sent by the zone who designates him/her, and has
     the right to a double vote when a votation is tied.
            The International Council is in charge of various things,
     like designating the International Technical Coordinator,
     setting the technical standards (either directly or by naming a
     "technical comitee"), publishing the net's official newsletter,
     and establishing the net's basic, international rules.
     Comprehensive rules are established by each zone's
     association.
            The International Council also acts as a "supreme
     tribunal" for interzonal disputes. Any disputes within a zone
     are to be arbitrated by the zone's association.
            The Zonal FidoNet Associations are to be TRANSPARENTLY
     DEMOCRATIC, which ensures the democratic qualities of the
     International FidoNet Council, as well as of the net itself.
            The Zonal Associations have the right to name the
     coordinators for all the networks, regions as well as the
     zone's.
            I personally think this idea has still to be shaped
     up. Anyway, the "main idea", that puts a special emphasis in
     democracy, as well as on each sysops' right to determine their
     coordinators, authorities and delegates to the main,
     International Council, is there.
            I would like everybody to participate in the development
     of this new idea, to ensure it's representability of all the
     sysop's wishes.
            Please, send mail to node 1200/1 with your opinions (in
     North America, you can send it thru 135/14 which is the gateway
     to Latin America).
            If FidoNet's current authorities, as well as IFNA's
     AND a large group of sysops consider the idea feasible, an
     echomail conference could be created to ensure everybody's
     participation on the development of this new idea.
            Thank you for taking the time to read this article, and
     thanks IFNA for maintaining a publication where everyone can
     express oneself freely.

       and then Some.


     Recently there has been a push to clean up the baud flags in the
     nodelist.  It seems they often get misused and it also seems
     that sysops are not following any standard in their use or
     nomenclature.  Apparently there is a host of new software
     becoming available that depends on the correct use and code for
     the baud flags, and so an effort is underway to get these
     nodelist flags cleaned up.  Therefore, this seems like an
     opportune time to talk about the use of the #CM: flag.

     From my discussions with local sysops it would appear that the
     #CM: flag is greatly misunderstood and often misused.  To begin
     with, the #CM: flag refers to "CONTINUOUS MAIL" capability, not
     "CRASH MAIL" capability.  There is a distinct and important
     difference.  Many sysops are running bulletin board and/or
     mailer software that supports CRASH mail, but do not have their
     systems available for incoming mail 24 hours per day.  The #CM:
     flag means that you are able to accept mail anytime day or
     night, 365 days out of the year (barring unforeseen acts of God,
     or nuclear holocaust).  In other words, to qualify for the #CM:
     flag, you have to have CRASH mail capability AND be running a
     system that accepts incoming mail at all times.

     The above description would probably get you past the FIDONET
     boarder patrol in terms of qualifying you for the #CM: flag, but
     there is more to consider.  A #CM: "purest" would argue that to
     REALLY qualify, you would have to be able to release any
     outgoing mail destined for a system that happens to call your
     system delivering mail.  For example, lets say you are system
     X/1 and have some mail to go out to system Y/1.  Your outgoing
     mail for Y/1 has not been labeled as CRASH mail.  Your intent is
     for the mail for Y/1 to go out during your next regularly
     scheduled mail event (perhaps National Mail Hour).  But prior to
     your next mail event, system Y/1 happens to call your system to
     deliver mail (completely unaware that you have mail for him).
     The ideal #CM: system would release the mail to Y/1 at that
     time, eliminating the need to wait until X/1's (your) next mail
     event, and also preventing X/1 (you) from picking up the cost
     for the mail intended for Y/1.  Having this kind of continuous
     mail capability requires a little more routing finesse.  In
     order to build a system with this "mail releasing" capability
     requires you to have outgoing mail "bundled" at all times
     because you cannot predict when a call will come in for which
     you happen to have some outgoing mail.  How do you do that?  It
     is really quite easy.  The following description refers to how I
     do it using SEAdog.  I am sure there are other ways to
     accomplish the same thing (perhaps even better ways, though I
     doubt it).  I do not know how this would be accomplished using
     OPUS, or Binkley, or any of the myriad other mailer programs.  I
     only speak SEAdog, I've never learned OMMM (is that some
     mystical East Indian mantra???).  You'll have to suffer through
     someone else's description of this stuff to learn how to do it
     with other software.

     FidoNews 5-24                Page 4                   13 Jun 1988


     The idea, as I said before, is to have all outgoing mail bundled
     and to give SEAdog permission to release all outgoing mail at
     all times.  With this in mind, the routing commands are
     straightforward:

                    Hold All
                    Send-to All
                    Give-to All

     This combination of routing statements bundles all of your
     outgoing mail with a "hold" flag on each parcel, and gives
     SEAdog permission to release any parcel when the destination
     system happens to call in.  Now, all that remains is to give
     this set of commands a routing tag and stuff that Schedule in
     between all your other events.  Lets say you give this set of
     commands the Schedule J tag (that just happens to be the tag I
     am using for this purpose).  Now lets say a segment of your
     CONFIG.DOG looks like this:

                  event X40 All 01:00        ;some external event
                  event C   All 01:00 02:00  ;a 1-hour mail event
                  event D   All 03:00 04:00  ;another mail event

     You have an hour in there (from 2 until 3 in the AM) when you
     are not in a mail event.  You are going to want to stuff your
     Schedule J in there so that, if a system for which you have
     outgoing mail happens to call during that time period, your mail
     to him will be released.  The revised CONFIG.DOG segment would
     look like this:

                  event X40 All 01:00        ;some external event
                  event C   All 01:00 02:00  ;a 1-hour mail event
                  event J   All 02:00 03:00  ;HERE'S THE BEEF
                  event D   All 03:00 04:00  ;another mail event

     As described in the preceding example, you would go through your
     entire schedule of events in CONFIG.DOG and stuff "event J" in
     between all of your other events such that you are running
     "event J" at all times that you are not involved in some other
     scheduled event.

     There are a couple of other considerations:  Most of you
     probably are running a bulletin board as well as running a
     mailer, and want the ability to have incoming "human" callers
     (although I have heard more than one sysop say that they could
     run a really neat BBS if people would just stop calling it...).
     Remember to add the "BBS" statement in conjunction with each
     "event J" so that SEAdog will know to relinquish control to your
     BBS when a human calls in during one of those events.

                  event J   All 02:00 03:00 BBS
                                            ^^^

     Secondly, you are likely to have large blocks of time where you
     have no other scheduled events and will want to be running
     "event J".  For example, I don't have any events to speak of on
     FidoNews 5-24                Page 5                   13 Jun 1988


     my board between 6am and midnight the following day.  It is
     possible to put one "event J' in there to fill in that entire
     block of time.  However, that is not extremely desirable because
     it limits your use of CRASH mail events.  Let me give you an
     example.  Lets say it's noon and I'm on my lunch break (one of
     the few times during the normal business day when I get to play
     with my bulletin board).  I decide to send some CRASH mail, so I
     compose the messages and attach the CRASH flag, then go and eat
     my day-old tunafish sandwich.  The system will go about its
     business attempting to send out my messages, but if the
     destination system happens to be busy and the mail does not go
     through, then "event J" would be re-installed and the system
     would not attempt to send the CRASH mail again until the next
     time I have a scheduled event, which in this fishy example, is
     not for several more hours.  The way around this problem is to
     avoid an "event J" that covers multiple hours.  Instead, start a
     new schedule J every hour when you have large blocks of time in
     the day without other scheduled events.  Here is an example of
     another segment of my CONFIG.DOG that demonstrates this:

                  event J   All 12:00 13:00 BBS
                  event J   All 13:00 14:00 BBS
                  event J   All 14:00 15:00 BBS

     ...and so forth and so on


     Oh...if that weren't enough... to bore you even further with
     additional trivia about the #CM: flag, there is one more
     consideration that comes to mind.  We need to turn this thing
     around and look at it from the opposite direction.  Lets say you
     are sending out CRASH mail and the destination system happens to
     have mail waiting for you to pick up, and the sysop of that
     destination node has read this silly article and has sprinkled
     "event J's" throughout his CONFIG.DOG.  His mail for you is
     properly bundled and waiting for your call, and his SEAdog has
     permission to release mail to you if you happen to call in.
     Unfortunately, if you are using SEAdog's predefined "Schedule S"
     for your CRASH mail event, you won't pick up your mail even if
     the sysop of the destination node has gone to the trouble to set
     it up this way, because SEAdog's Schedule S is defined as "Send-
     only"  (that's what the "S" in Schedule S stands for guys).  So
     your system will not look for mail addressed to you when it's
     out delivering your CRASH mail.  There is a quick fix to this
     problem however.  Simply define a "Schedule S" in your ROUTE.DOG
     and give it one simple command:

                  Schedule S
                   Pickup All


     If you follow the above suggestions, you will have a system that
     truly qualifies you for the use of the #CM: flag.  You will
     accept incoming mail at all times, you will have outgoing mail
     bundled and will release those mail packets if they are
     addressed to incoming "mail" callers, and you will pick up mail
     FidoNews 5-24                Page 6                   13 Jun 1988


     addressed to you when you are sending out CRASH mail.

     Remember, the #CM: flag is preceded with the "#" sign.  It is
     one of a group of baud flags that indicate the time of day your
     system is available for incoming mail.  The other members of
     this group reflect the beginning of an hour in Greenwich Mean
     Time:

        #09:     Accepts incoming mail beginning 0900 GMT
        #18:     Accepts incoming mail beginning 1800 GMT
     ...and
        #CM:     Accepts incoming mail any ol' time

     and lastly (as if that weren't enough), remember that the #CM:
     flag is followed with a colon (:).  All baud flags are followed
     with a colon.  If you have several baud flags assigned to your
     system, they should be separated by a comma.  For example, the
     baud flags for my system are:

                       XP:,#CM:

     Next month we'll talk about the XP: flag (gag! belch!...)

     "Your sink is fixed." he said with his deep, gravely voice.
     "What upsets you?"  the old Indian then asked through lips that
     barely moved.

     "Ahhhhh, I dunno!  I am sick and tired of everyone treating me
     like dirt!"

     His dark, withered face frowning, Indios shuffled his large
     frame to an overstuffed chair and sat down.

     "How do they do this?  I am not understanding."

     Ron was surprised.  In over 2 years he had never known Indios
     to solicit a conversation.

     "Well, some people are real idiots and think they know it all.
     They like to lord over other people, pretending they are
     smarter or better.  All they really have are big mouths!  I am
     going to start defending myself!  I am going to be more
     assertive!"

     "Tell to me the difference of you being 'assertive' and them
     having 'big mouths'?" Indios asked without expression.

     Ron did not answer.

     "You sit in front of this for hours," Indios continued,
     pointing to the computer on Ron's desk, "and it angers you.
     How can this be?"

     "It started off to be fun," Ron answered, "then everyone
     started flaming at each other!"

     Ron could see that he was only confusing Indios.

     "See, with the computer, a bunch of people can leave messages
     to each other.  It's like a big hobby for computer buffs.
     There is an amateur network that I belong to where we can leave
     mail.  It was fun until it became too crowded.  Now everyone
     just fights with each other.  If someone misspells a word,
     someone jumps on him.  If someone asks a question or has an
     idea that someone else thinks is stupid, then the name calling
     starts.  We call it 'flaming'."

     Indios grunted and nodded that he understood.

     "So, you meet people on your machine so you can get angry at
     each other.  You go to work and your clubs and get angry at
     others.  Driving your car makes you angry at others ..."

     "Exactly!"  Ron exclaimed.  "Unless you stand up for yourself,
     someone will walk all over you!  Believe me, when someone
     shoves it to me I am going to pay them back in spades!"

     The Indian brushed his long, white hair back with his weathered
     hands and looked sadly at Ron.

     "So much anger ... This will make you better than them?  Anger
     can at times be a tool but, like a surgeons knife, it should
     only be used when all else has failed and the cause is just ...
     only then with great care and control.  Most swing this blade
     recklessly and wound themselves."

     "I am sick and tired of reading this crap!  I am sick and tired
     of these pious bastards jumping on every little thing I do!"

     "Maybe they have a fear ... maybe they have a need.  The
     smallest pups always growl the loudest.  The others that are
     secure will allow this because they know these pups have needs
     that only can be provided for by their pretending dominance.
     Even with wolves, the strongest and fastest in the pack will
     allow the pretenders their moments, as they know it is their
     need and all they can really achieve."

     Now Ron was puzzled.  "You mean I should just ignore these
     twinks?!  That I should let them say vile things about me and
     others?!"

     "Do they strip you of your honor?  Are you denied all dignity?
     Your family was not threatened, your ability to provide for
     those that depend on you was not threatened ... your honor was
     not taken."

     "I have my pride!"

     "Pride is not honor.  You must know when NOT to fight before
     you will ever know when it is proper TO fight.  Your words of
     anger are that of a child.  Show me the burial sites of those
     killed by mere words ..."

     Ron knew he was losing the debate.  This one was face to face
     FidoNews 5-24                Page 9                   13 Jun 1988


     and the words had texture, tone and emphasis ... not like text
     written on a flat monitor screen.

     "Take what is good with this and all else in life and leave
     behind what is bad."  Indios continued, leaning forward, his
     eyes fixed in a gaze at Ron.  "I know enough about you to say
     that you were granted neither the natural gift of a powerful
     body nor a powerful mind at birth.  You were granted a more
     valuable gift, the gift to build whatever body and mind you
     choose.  There are no boundaries for this gift.  All you do,
     every day, in all walks, makes you what you are and what you
     will be."

     Indios then stood and walked to the doorway.  Ron remained
     silent.

     "Will you build your body and soul of sound materials or will
     you use the waste of the earth and become all that you
     despise?" Indios asked with a hint of a smile as he departed.

     Ron strolled slowly back to his desk and sat down in front of
     the computer.  He hit a key to awaken his blank screen and then
     began rereading the message that had upset him earlier.  After
     a moment he moved on to the next message, leaving the hate
     unanswered.

     "We're just puppies ... " he mumbled under his breath.  "I
     guess Fido grew up and had a whole lot of puppies  ..."

     He then began a reply to a message from a friend in Puerto
     Rico.  "Take what is good ..."

     Neal Curtin
     1:343/1

                     Proposed International Policy


     Section I: FidoNet
         1. What is FidoNet

          FidoNet is the worldwide collection of Bulletin Boards that
     operate under a protocol established by Tom Jennings called Fido.
     The basic structure of the network is as follows, from the lowest
     point to the highest.

         POINT: A point is the lowest subdivision, and is a system
     that is mail only and will only connect to a parent or BOSS node.
     It is not listed in the nodelist.

         NODE: A node is the lowest public position in the nodelist.
     It is normally a fully functional system that can act as a
     bulletin board and also send and receive mail and files.

         HUB: A hub is a system which is set up to provide a service
     to a small group of nodes that is a sub geographical group of a
     net.

         NET: A net is a geographical collection of Nodes that has
     banded together in order to share common interests or reduce
     costs.

         REGION: This is a collection of nets and independent nodes
     that are contained in a larger geographical or geopolitical
     entity. The net may also be a special interest group.

         ZONE: The zone is a larger collection of regions and nets.
     Currently there are three zones, zone1 is North and South
     America, zone2 is Europe and Africa, and zone3 is Australia and
     the South Pacific area.

         There are additional zones, but these are large networks that
     do not want to directly participate in the FidoNet Nodelist. They
     are zone7, AlterNet, and zone99, GoodEggNet. Communication can be
     established with these zones either by means of zone gates or by
     including them in your local nodelist.

     SECTION II:  LEVELS OF FIDONET

         The FidoNet  Network is  broken down  into many  different
     levels  much as  the hierarchy  within any  efficient
     organization.  Thru past  history, the following hierarchy has
     developed:

          1. All  System Operators  (SysOps) taken collectively
     (FidoNet).  This is the highest level  of  the  structure,  and
     represents  the entirety of FidoNet.

     FidoNews 5-24                Page 11                  13 Jun 1988


          2. International Coordinator (IC) This position is an
     administrative position and is responsible for the publication of
     the Nodelist. The IC is also the court of last resort in disputes
     between zones.

          3. Zone  Coordinator (ZC).  This position oversees one Zone
     of FidoNet and is  responsible for  the smooth functioning of
     FidoNet within that Zone. The ZC is the court of last resort
     within his zone, unless the dispute is inter zonal in nature.

          4. Regional  Coordinator (RC).   This  position  oversees
     one  Region within a  Zone and  is responsible  for the smooth
     functioning of FidoNet within that Region.

          5. Network  Coordinator (NC).   This  position oversees one
     Network in one Region  and is  responsible for  the  smooth
     functioning  of FidoNet within that Network.

          6. SysOp.   This  is the singular unit of FidoNet.  The
     SysOp runs his or her  own FidoNet  capable software  such that their
     system can function as  part of FidoNet within the guidelines
     imposed by the various levels of FidoNet above the SysOp level. Those
     guidelines are formulated over time as defined in this document.


     SECTION III: RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES
               Disputes are bound to arise, and the solutions are
     many. This document is cover only disputes which are between
     zones. Each zone is to develop it's own policy statement for
     disputes within it's own area, and each region/net is encouraged
     to set up it's own policy, not to conflict with a higher policy.

          1. A zone council will be set up comprised of three regional
     coordinators from within each zone. In case of a dispute between
     zones, a disinterested zone will be selected to act as a court.
     Each zone will submit their side of the dispute, not to exceed 10
     pages, to the selected zone council. The zone council shall then
     make their decision with 10 days of the submittal. The majority
     rule applies. Appeals may be made to the IC, who may also form a
     council. The IC decision will be final, and there will be no
     further mediation.

          2. The IC council will consist of at least 2 regional
     coordinators from each zone. They will review the same submittal
     as the zone council received, and will make their decision in 10
     days.


     SECTION IV:  POLICIES

               Each zone is responsible for setting up a zone policy.
     This policy will detail the requirements for a Zone Mail Hour
     (ZMH), the handling of echo mail, the responsibilities of the
     various regional coordinators, and any special conditions which
     may exist.

     FidoNews 5-24                Page 12                  13 Jun 1988


     Section V:   INTERNATIONAL COORDINATOR

               Because of the high position of trust that the IC must
     hold, the position must be filled by someone who has not only the
     technical qualifications, but must also be free from political
     constraints. For this reason, the IC must not hold any other
     position with the entire FidoNet community. When the position
     becomes vacant, the senior ZC will assume the position until a
     new IC can be elected.

               The election procedures are as follows:

               1. The RC's will nominate a slate of potential
     candidates from within their zone. These candidates will then be
     proposed to all the NC's, RC's within the zone will elect one
     candidate for a inter zonal election.

               2. The candidates from the zone elections will then
     submit their position in the FidoNews for reading by all the
     members of the community. The election will then be held.

               3. The time frame for the election of the IC must be
     short, and should be accomplished within 30 days.

               4. Voting will be done by nets, regions, and zones.
     Each net will hold an election process, results to forwarded to
     the Region. The Regional independents will vote through the RC.
     The RC will forward the Region vote to the ZC. Only votes will be
     counted. Abstensions will not count. A pure majority will decide
     the outcome.

               RECALL procedures.

               1. A recall can be initiated at any level.

               2. A majority in a net or a region or a zone is
     required to start a recall election. The recall election will be
     conducted in the same manor as the IC election, but will be a yay
     or nay vote only. Upon completion, the IC must abide by the
     decision.

               3. Each operating area will only be able to start one
     protest per year.

                   KIDS ECHO CONFERENCE GUIDELINES

     1. PURPOSE: The purpose of this document  is   to  deleniate
     responsibilities,  guidlines,  and proceedures for the users
     of the KIDS Echo Conference.

     2. SCOPE: The KIDS Echo Conference was established to  allow
     young  people  up  to  the  age  of  18  to  have freedom of
     information interchange in an environment that  is  directed
     primarily toward an adult audiance. Allowing our children to
     have an area of thier own is necessary to give  our kids the
     opportunity to  expand  their  capabilities  in the  age  of
     electronics  and  home  computing. Our children are our most
     valued resources in the persuit of a  future  for  a  nation
     with  strong goals in computers. Our future belongs to them.
     They are our destiny. The KIDS Echo Conference was  designed
     with  them  in  mind. Therefore, each adult should encourage
     its  use  and   give   it   direction.   Direction   without
     interferance except to insure that the echo is wholesome and
     that it grows with common decency as viewed by the public as
     a whole.

     3. GENERAL: Teachers are encouraged  to  allow  students  to
     send  traffic  such as Pen-Pal letters, history, trivia, and
     anything  that  will  encourage  and assist in the growth of
     their students. Utilize the echo as a training  aid  limited
     only  by  your  knowledge  and  immagination.  Encourage the
     exchange  of  information  between  students  of   different
     geographical   locations   for  computer  science,  history,
     cultures,  etc.  Spread  the knowledge of this echo to local
     school boards and faculty for future  projects  in  computer
     science and as a aid in the students growth in a nation with
     multiple goals in the arena of computer science.

     Parents  are  encouraged  to  assist  thier  children in the
     utilization  of  this  echo.  This  will  develope   healthy
     computing  habits  and  keep  the  echo  interesting for the
     children. Parents are also encouraged to promote the echo at
     school meetings like the Parent Teachers Accosiation  (PTA),
     open  house  funtions at the schools, and through any medium
     that will assist the growth of thier children in this area.

     Users  are  encouraged  to submit suggestions, comments, and
     ideas to help with the growth of this echo.  The  users  are
     the  heart  of  the echo and its existance is dependant upon
     your utilization of it. Promote a healthy environment  which
     is  suitable for children. Use peer pressure as necessary to
     stop any misuse of the echo. Remember the children  of  this
     great  nation  are  our  future and they hold the key to the
     advancement of a nation with strong goals  in  the  computer
     field.

     4. RESPONSIBILITIES:
     FidoNews 5-24                Page 14                  13 Jun 1988


     a. SYSTEM OPERATORS (Sysops): Sysops that request and  allow
     the KIDS Echo Conference on thier Bulletin Board System must
     monitor  the  echo  to insure thier users do not abuse other
     users or the echo as a whole. This  includes  reporting  any
     misuse that the sysop cannot  control to the Net Coordinator
     or Echo Moderator as necessary. Sysops will not  allow  foul
     language  for  any reason, missuse of the echo by adults and
     children alike, and not allow  what  is  commonly  known  as
     "Flames". If a user  utilizes  the  KIDS  echo  for  message
     traffic  that  is  better  served  by another echo, then the
     sysop will direct that user to the appropriate area/echo.

     b.  USERS:  Users  are  responsible for the echo as a whole.
     Therefore, misuse by the users can cause the termination  of
     the  echo  in  part or as a whole. You must insure that foul
     language is not tolerated and not  used.  Peer  pressure  is
     your  tool.  Tell  another  user that he/she is incorrect in
     using foul language and that this echo  is  directed  toward
     children  under  the age of 18. If the other user continues,
     report it immediately to the System Operator.  This  can  be
     done in private as necessary. If the sysop does nothing in a
     reasonable leangth  of  time,  report the problem to the Net
     Coordinator or to the Echo Moderator. You must  utilize  the
     echo in the context of its design. Keep a healthy acceptable
     attitude  and  enter  messages  that  are  suitable  for the
     children that use the echo. Promote  the  free  exchange  of
     information  and  discourage  misuse.  Traffic  such as love
     letters, private messages, sexual remarks,  racist  remarks,
     religous  comments, and "Flames" are forbidden in this echo.
     There are other echoes that allow  that  kind  of  abuse  or
     harrasement (Go  there!). Wars are not allowed  i.e.  Johnny
     picking on Joe, Grade 12 verses grade 6, Texas against Porta
     Rico, country  against  country,  unless  they  are  in  the
     context  of  learning  and  then  they must be from the text
     book approved by the Educational Departments.

     5.   GENERAL   INFORMATION:  The  following  information  is
     submitted for your use as necessary:

     a. KidsNews Newsletter: The kidsNews newsletter was  created
     by  Brandy  Witherspoon,  age 13, of Edwardsville, Illinous,
     Net/Node 100/525.  She  is  the  Editor  and  Chief  of  the
     newsletter  and  has done an outstanding job in its content.
     The newletter is maintained and utilized by the users of the
     KIDS  echo  in   sharing   information,   ideas,   articles,
     editorials,  programs,  trivia,  etc. for the audiance which
     the echo is designed for (kids 18 and  below).  Distribution
     of   the   newsletter  can  be  arranged  through  the  Echo
     Moderator or Echo Coordinator. If you would like  to  submit
     articles in the newsletter, send it in the KIDS echo area or
     through  NetMail  to  Claude Witherspoon, 100/525. This will
     ensure your article is  included  in  the  newsletter  in  a
     timely manner.

                          Policy and Procedures Guide
                                 Net 343 version
                                    Version 1



                                    Chapter 1

                                    OVERVIEW





     1.1     The Levels of the Net

     The Net is grouped on several levels.  These are as follows:


     o   Network; The network  is  a  collection  of  nodes,
         specifically the city and surrounding territory of Seattle,
         reachable from the central area of Seattle by a no-charge fee
         from Pacific Northwest Bell.

     o   Hub;  Any Hub will be an extension of the network coordinator
         so as to increase the calling capability, or to extend the
         net into a new area, until such time as they may be able to
         form their own net. Hubs will be established for Echomail,
         and for other purposes as may arise.

     o   Node;  A  node  is a single FidoNet address,  and is the
         smallest recognized unit of FidoNet.

     o   Points; A point is a node on a private network which is
         accessible through a node on FidoNet.


     1.2     Coordinator

     o   The Network Coordinator;  A Network Coordinator maintains the
         list of  any  nodes  in  his  network  that are not served by
         a hub and accepts node lists from the Hub Coordinators in
         his  network.  He compiles  these  lists  to  create  a
         network  node  list for his network,  which he then  sends
         to  his  Regional  Coordinator.  A  Network  Coordinator  is
         also responsible for forwarding any mail addressed to nodes
         in his network.

     o   The Hub Coordinator; A Hub Coordinator maintains the list of
         nodes in his hub  and  sends  it  to  his  Network
         Coordinator.  A  Hub Coordinator  is also responsible for
         forwarding any mail addressed  to nodes in his hub.

         gateway to the regional echo coordinator.  The Sysop (or
         system operator) of that node then acts as the coordinator
         for the network. This Sysop will be responsible for the
         coordination and distribution of all echo mail within the
         net. Cooperation with the net coordinator is expected, but is
         not required. The final decision on echo distribution will
         reside with the echo coordinator.

     o   The Sysop; A Sysop formulates his own policy for running his
         board and dealing with his users,  so that will not be
         discussed in this document.  However,  a  Sysop  must also
         mesh with the rest of the FidoNet system if he is to send and
         receive mail, and that will be discussed here.


     The primary responsibility of any coordinator is technical
     management of  network  operations.  Management decisions should
     be made strictly on technical grounds.

     SYSOP Procedures

     A sysop of an individual node can pretty much do  as  he
     pleases,  as long  as  he observes the mail events,  is not
     excessively annoying to other  nodes  on  FidoNet,  and  does
     not promote the distribution of pirated copyrighted software.

     National  Mail  Hour is the heart of FidoNet,  as this is when
     network mail is passed between systems.  Any system which wishes
     to be a  part of  FidoNet must be able to receive mail at this
     time.  NMH is defined as 1 AM to 2 AM, pacific STANDARD time.
     This does not vary with daylight savings time. Additional time
     for mail within the net is from 2 AM to 2:30 AM PST. This is to
     allow for any mail received by the host (Coordinator) to be
     distributed. THIS TIME IS TO BE A RECEIVE ONLY TIME. Only the
     host will be sending during this time. During NMH and the net
     mail time, no users (callers) are allowed.

     Failure  to  observe  the proper mail events is sufficient
     grounds for any node to be dropped from FidoNet without notice
     (since  notice  is generally given by FidoNet mail).


     2.1     How to get a node number

     You  must  first obtain a current node list so that you can send
     mail. You do not need a node number to send mail,  but you must
     have one  in order for others to send mail to you.

     Once  you  have  a node list,  you must then send Net mail to the
     host, 343/0, during NMH. Your application for a node number must
     be sent to the coordinator  by FidoNet mail, and must include at
     least the following:

         1) Your name.
         2) The name of your system.
         3) The city and state where your system is located.
     FidoNews 5-24                Page 18                  13 Jun 1988


         4) The phone number to be used when calling your system.
         5) Your hours of operation.
         6) The maximum baud rate you can support.

     2.2     If you are going down

     If  your  node will be down for an extended period (more than a
     day or two), then you should inform your coordinator as soon as
     possible.  If you do not do this,  then other systems will still
     try  to  reach  you while  you are down,  much to the annoyance
     of everyone.  Do not under any  circumstances  put an answering
     machine or similar device on your phone line while you are down.
     If you do,  then calling systems  will get  the  machine
     repeatedly,  racking up large phone bills,  which is very
     annoying.  See the section on Resolution of Disputes for  details
     on what happens to annoying people.

     If  you  will be leaving your system unattended for an extended
     period of time (such as while you are on vacation),  you should
     notify  your coordinator.  Systems  do have a tendency to "crash"
     now and then,  so you will probably want your coordinator to know
     that it is a temporary condition if it happens while you are
     away.


     COORDINATOR PROCEDURES

     This  chapter describes the procedures followed by the
     coordinator at the NET level.

     The  coordinator  has  four  primary duties.  In order of
     decreasing importance, they are:

         1) Administrative tasks.

         2) Node list distribution.

         3) Newsletter distribution.

         4) Network mail distribution.

     At first glance it would seem that network mail distribution
     should be the highest priority,  since after all  that's  why
     we're  running  a network in the first place.  But the first
     three priorities are needed to  ensure  smooth  operation  of
     the network,  and hence must have a higher priority.



      Administrative tasks

     First  and  foremost,  every  coordinator is also the sysop of
     his own node.  It must be possible for others to reach you  by
     network  mail. So  in  addition  to  the other tasks of a
     coordinator,  you must also observe all of the requirements for
     being a node.
     FidoNews 5-24                Page 19                  13 Jun 1988


      Maintaining the node list

     A coordinator at any level must maintain his portion of the node
     list. Almost any coordinator will have some nodes in his node
     list which are not a part of any subgroup.  For  example,  a
     Zone  Coordinator  must maintain  a list of administrative nodes
     for his zone,  and a Regional Coordinator must maintain a list of
     independent nodes in  his  region. A  Hub  Coordinator  (or  the
     Network Coordinator in a network without hubs) must maintain the
     list of all nodes in his area.

     A  coordinator is responsible for seeing to it that his portion
     of the node  list  is  kept  reasonably  accurate.   You  should
     attempt  to implement  name  changes,  phone number changes,  and
     so forth in this node list as soon as possible.  You should also
     check  from  time  to time  to  ensure  that  all of the listed
     nodes are in fact capable of accepting network mail.  How best to
     accomplish this is left  to  your discretion.

      Assigning node numbers

     A node number will not be assigned until a formal request from
     that system has been received by FidoNet mail.  This will ensure
     that the system is at least  minimally operational. Additionally,
     that system will be checked to ensure that it can receive both
     mail and files. Before accessing echomail, the system will have
     to demonstrate that it can use the echomail system by using the
     local NET343 echo. The  strict  maintenance  of this policy has
     been one of the great strengths of FidoNet.

     Network mail will be used to inform a new node of his  node
     number, as this helps to insure that he is capable of receiving
     network mail.

      Problem resolution

     If the problem is caused by a node within the net, then you will
     contact the net coordinator, who will attempt to resolve the
     problem. If the problem is outside of the net, then you should
     contact the coordinator of the other net, but be sure that you
     send a copy of the complaint to your own coordinator.

     If the problem is with the region, send the complaint to the
     network coordinators concerned, and to the regional coordinator.

     Any complaints received by the network coordinator will be
     forwarded to the regional coordinator for information purposes.

      Formulating local policy

     It  is  your  responsibility to formulate any local policies
     which are required for the smooth operation of your assigned
     area.  Any policies you establish must not conflict with any
     policies  established  by  a coordinator above you or with this
     policy document.

     FidoNews 5-24                Page 20                  13 Jun 1988


      Node list distribution

     The node list is posted weekly on Saturday,  along with a
     "difference file"  giving  the changes for the week.  The
     nodediff will be distributed to each node as soon as possible.
     It is recommended you make it available for download by the
     general user, but this is not required.



     3.3     Newsletter distribution

     The newsletter, called FidoNews,  is published weekly on Monday
     and is distributed as an archive named FNEWSvnn.ARC,  where "v"
     is the volume number and "nn" is the issue number.  It will be
     distributed in the same manor as the nodelist. It is also
     desirable that you make  it  available for  download  by  the
     general user in both archive an non archive form, but this is not
     required.

      Anything else

     You should encourage sysops and users in your region to
     contribute  to FidoNews.  If you receive any submissions,  you
     should forward them to the FidoNews publisher.  Think of yourself
     as being a regional  bureau chief on the FidoNews editorial
     staff.

     FidoNews  and  the  node  list  are  the  glue that holds us
     together. Without them,  we cease to be a community,  and  become
     just  another random collection of bulletin boards.

      Specific coordinator procedures

     A Network Coordinator is responsible for assigning node numbers
     to any nodes  within  his network which are not managed by a Hub
     Coordinator. A Network Coordinator is also  responsible  for
     allocating  any  hubs within  his network and for appointing a
     Hub Coordinator for each hub. If a Network Coordinator assigns
     any Hub Coordinators,  then  he  also assigns a pool of numbers
     to each Hub Coordinator for use in assigning node numbers.

     It  is  the  responsibility  of  a  Network Coordinator to
     receive all inbound mail for nodes in  his  network  and  to
     forward  it  to  its recipients.  How  to  accomplish this is
     left to the discretion of the Network Coordinator.  However,
     there are a few exceptions:

     1) Once in awhile a node will try to make a "bombing run"
     (sending one message to a great many nodes).  Bombing runs are
     considered to  be annoying, and will be cause for a formal
     complaint.

     2) Occasionally  a  user  will  appear  who  receives  a great
     deal of traffic.  If a single node is receiving enough  mail  to
     interfere with  mail  delivery  to  the other nodes in his
     FidoNews 5-24                Page 21                  13 Jun 1988


     network,  then his Network Coordinator can refer him to his
     Regional  Coordinator  for reassignment as an independent node.


     A Network Coordinator is responsible for assigning any additional
     mail events  which  may be required for operation of his network.
     Any node in a network may  be  excommunicated  for  failing  to
     observe  these additional mail events.

     A  Network  Coordinator may appoint a node as the outbound
     gateway for his network if he so desires and if one  can  be
     found.  In  no  case should  a node be appointed as an outbound
     gateway unless the sysop of that node is willing and able to
     provide reasonably reliable  service. Note that a Network
     Coordinator is not required to appoint an outbound gateway.  If
     a  Network  Coordinator  chooses  to appoint an outbound gateway,
     then it is left to the Network Coordinator to establish  any
     rules, policies, and procedures relating to its use.

      Hub Coordinator procedures

     A  Hub  Coordinator is responsible for assigning node numbers to
     nodes in his area.  Each Hub Coordinator will be assigned a pool
     of  numbers to  use  when  assigning node numbers.  A Hub
     Coordinator should never assign a node number outside of this
     pool, and should never assign the same number to more than one
     node.  If a Hub Coordinator  assigns  all of the numbers in his
     pool, he should apply to his Network Coordinator for additional
     numbers.

     It  is  the responsibility of a Hub Coordinator to receive all
     inbound mail for nodes in his hub and to forward it to its
     recipients.  How to accomplish this is left to the  discretion
     of  the  Hub  Coordinator. However, the same exceptions apply
     here as for a Network Coordinator.

     A  Hub  Coordinator  may  have  additional duties,  as assigned
     by his Network Coordinator.


       RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES



     The  world  not  being  perfect,  sometimes  troubles  crop  up.
     Any organization larger than a cub scout pack needs some sort of
     grievance procedure, and FidoNet is no exception.

     The FidoNet judicial philosophy can be summed up in two rules:

         1) Thou shalt not excessively annoy others.

         2) Thou shalt not be too easily annoyed.

     In  other  words,  there  are  no hard and fast rules of conduct,
     but reasonably polite behavior is expected.  Also,  in  any
     FidoNews 5-24                Page 22                  13 Jun 1988


     dispute  both sides  are examined,  and action could be taken
     against either or both parties. ("Judge not, lest ye be judged!")

     In  any  case  of  annoying  behavior the person to complain to
     is the coordinator of the person who is annoying you.  For
     example,  if  you have a problem with a point or a user you would
     complain to his sysop, or  if  you  have  a  problem  with  a
     Regional Coordinator you would complain to his Zone Coordinator,
     and so on.

     If the coordinator you complain to fails to resolve the problem,
     then you  can  complain  to  his  coordinator.  For  example,  if
     you had a problem with a Hub  Coordinator,  you  would  first
     complain  to  his Network Coordinator.  Then if the Network
     Coordinator does not resolve the problem, you would complain to
     his Regional Coordinator.

     Do  not ever skip over a coordinator when filing a complaint.
     That in itself is annoying.

     This net shall be the one noted for non-flames. No one in this
     net shall flame another in the net. If you are thinking of
     flaming someone outside the net, be forewarned, a complaint filed
     against you by someone outside the net, will be taken seriously,
     and steps will be taken. We are friendly, loyal, trustworthy, and
     HONEST.

                               OVERVIEW



     FidoNet is an amateur electronic mail system.  As  such,  all  of
     its participants  and  operators  are non-paid volunteers.  From
     its early beginnings as a few friends swapping messages back and
     forth,  it  has now grown to  (August  1987)  over  2000
     different  systems  on  four continents.

     FidoNet  is  large  enough that it would quickly fall apart of
     its own weight unless some sort of structure and control were
     imposed  on  it. Multi net  operation  provides the structure.
     Decentralized management provides the control.  This document is
     an  attempt  to  describe  the procedures which have been
     developed to manage the network.



     1.1     The Levels of FidoNet

     FidoNet nodes are grouped on several levels.  These are as
     follows:

     o   FidoNet; This indicates the entire public amateur mail
         network, as administered by the  International  FidoNet
         Association,  and  as defined by the weekly node list.

     o   Zones;  A zone is a large geographic area containing many
         regions, and covering one or more countries and/or
         continents.

     o   Regions;  A region is a well defined  geographic  area
         containing nodes  which  may or may not be combined into
         networks.  A typical region will contain many nodes in
         networks,  and a few independent nodes, which are not a part
         of any network.

     o   Networks;  A  network  is  a  collection  of  nodes,  usually
         in a relatively small geographic area.  Networks coordinate
         their  mail activity to decrease cost and increase mail
         throughput.
     FidoNews 5-24                Page 24                  13 Jun 1988


     o   Hubs;  A hub is a subdivision of a network that assists in
         network management  by  routing  mail  to,  and  by
         coordinating  for,  a collection of nodes in that network.
         In general only  the  larger networks will have hubs.

     o   Nodes;  A  node  is a single FidoNet address,  and is the
         smallest recognized unit of FidoNet.

     o   Points; A point is a node on a private network which is
         accessible through a node on FidoNet.


     1.2     Coordinators

     Each subdivision  at  each  level  is  managed  by  a
     coordinator.  A coordinator  is  a  person  who  coordinates  the
     technical aspects of network mail.  This entails both
     administrative and  technical  tasks, which  will  be described
     later.  The following levels of coordinators are currently
     recognized:

     o   The  International  Coordinator;   The  International
     Coordinator compiles all of the node lists from all of the
     regions and creates the master node list, which is then
     distributed over FidoNet.

     o   The  Zone  Coordinator;  A  Zone Coordinator maintains the
     list of administrative nodes in his zone and accepts node lists
     from  the Regional  Coordinators  in  his  zone.  He compiles
     these lists to create a zone node list,  which he then sends to
     the International Coordinator  for  inclusion  in  the  master
     node  list.  A  Zone Coordinator  is  also responsible for
     overseeing any zone gateways in his zone.

     o   The Regional Coordinator;  A Regional  Coordinator  maintains
     the list  of  independent  nodes  in his region and accepts node
     lists from the Network Coordinators in his  region.  He  compiles
     these lists to create a regional node list for his region, which
     he then sends  to  his  Zone Coordinator.  A Regional Coordinator
     does not perform routing services for any nodes in his region.

     o   The Network Coordinator;  A Network Coordinator maintains the
     list of  any  nodes  in  his  network  that are not served by a
     hub and accepts node lists from the Hub Coordinators in  his
     network.  He compiles  these  lists  to  create  a  network  node
     list for his network,  which he then  sends  to  his  Regional
     Coordinator.  A Network  Coordinator  is  also responsible for
     forwarding any mail addressed to nodes in his network.

     o   The Hub Coordinator; A Hub Coordinator maintains the list of
     nodes in his hub  and  sends  it  to  his  Network  Coordinator.
     A  Hub Coordinator  is also responsible for forwarding any mail
     addressed to nodes in his hub.

     o   The Point Coordinator; Any node in FidoNet can act as a
     gateway to a point network.  The Sysop (or system operator) of
     FidoNews 5-24                Page 25                  13 Jun 1988


     that node then  acts as the coordinator for his point network.

     o   The Sysop; A Sysop formulates his own policy for running his
     board and dealing with his users,  so that will not be discussed
     in this document.  However,  a  Sysop  must also mesh with the
     rest of the FidoNet system if he is to send and receive mail, and
     that will be discussed here.


     These levels act to  distribute  the  administration  and
     control  of FidoNet  to  the  lowest  possible  level,  while
     still  allowing for coordinated action over the  entire  mail
     system.  Administration  is made  possible  by operating in a
     strict top-down manner.  That is,  a coordinator at any given
     level  is  responsible  to  the  coordinator immediately above
     him, and responsible for everyone below him.

     For example,  a Regional Coordinator is solely responsible to his
     Zone Coordinator for anything that may or may not  happen  in
     his  region. From  the  point  of  view  of  the  Zone
     Coordinator,  the  Regional Coordinator is totally  and
     completely  responsible  for  the  smooth operation  of  his
     region.  Likewise,  from  the point of view of the Regional
     Coordinator,   the  Network  Coordinators  are  totally  and
     completely responsible for the smooth operation of their
     networks.

     If  a coordinator at any level above sysop is unable for any
     reason to properly perform his duties,  he can be replaced by his
     coordinator at the next level up.  For example,  if a Regional
     Coordinator is failing to  perform  his  duties,  then his Zone
     Coordinator can appoint a new Regional Coordinator to replace
     him.

     The primary responsibility of any coordinator is technical
     management of  network  operations.  Management decisions should
     be made strictly on technical grounds.

                                SYSOP PROCEDURES



     A sysop of an individual node can pretty much do  as  he
     pleases,  as long  as  he observes the mail events,  is not
     excessively annoying to other  nodes  on  FidoNet,  and  does
     not promote the distribution of pirated copyrighted software.

     National  Mail  Hour is the heart of FidoNet,  as this is when
     network mail is passed between systems.  Any system which wishes
     to be a  part of  FidoNet must be able to receive mail at this
     time.  A system which is a member of a network may also be
     required  to  observe  additional mail events, as defined by his
     Network Coordinator.

     Failure  to  observe  the proper mail events is sufficient
     grounds for any node to be dropped from FidoNet without notice
     (since  notice  is generally given by FidoNet mail).

     Network mail systems generally operate unattended and place
     calls  at odd hours of the night.  If a system tries to call an
     incorrect or out of  date  number,  it could cause some poor
     citizen's phone to ring in the wee hours of the  morning,  much
     to  the  annoyance  of  innocent bystanders and civil
     authorities.  For this reason,  a sysop who sends mail is
     obligated to obtain and use the most  recent  edition  of  the
     node list as is practical.


     A system which has been  dropped  from  the  network  is  said
     to  be excommunicated (i.e.  unable to communicate).  A node
     which  has  been excommunicated may or may not be listed for a
     time in the "dog house", which is included in the comments at the
     end of the node list.  If you find  that  you  have  been
     excommunicated without warning,  then that means that your
     coordinator was unable  to  contact  you.  You  should rectify
     the problem and report back.

     The  exact  timing  of  National Mail Hour is set for each zone
     by the Zone  Coordinator.  In  zone 2 National  Mail  Hour  is
     observed from 0900 to 1000 GMT every day,  weekends included.

     FidoNet  does  not  observe  daylight  savings  time.  In  areas
     which observe daylight savings time  the  FidoNet  mail
     schedules  must  be adjusted  in  the  same direction as the
     clock change.  Alternatively, you can simply leave your system on
     standard time.

     2.1     How to get a node number

     You  must  first obtain a current node list so that you can send
     mail. You do not need a node number to send mail,  but you must
     have one  in order for others to send mail to you.

     The first step in obtaining a current node list is to locate a
     FidoNet bulletin board.  No help there;  you're on  your  own.
     Most  bulletin board lists include at  least  a  few  FidoNet
     systems,  and  usually identify them as such, so this shouldn't
     be too hard.

     If the sysop of any FidoNet system does not have a node list
     available for downloading, then he can probably tell you where to
     get one.

     Once  you  have  a node list,  you must determine which
     coordinator to apply to.  The coordinator of any network or
     region  is  always  node zero  of  that  network  or  region.  A
     Hub Coordinator will always be indicated in the node list by a
     "HUB" prefix.

     You should apply to the  lowest-level  coordinator  that  covers
     FidoNews 5-24                Page 27                  13 Jun 1988


     your area.  For  example,  if  you are located within the hub of
     a network, then you would apply to the Hub Coordinator.  If there
     is  no  network that  covers  your  area,   then  you  would
     apply  to  the  Regional Coordinator for your region.

     Your application for a node number must be sent to the
     coordinator  by FidoNet mail, and must include at least the
     following:

         1) Your name.
         2) The name of your system.
         3) The city and state where your system is located.
         4) The phone number to be used when calling your system.
         5) Your hours of operation.
         6) The maximum baud rate you can support.

     Your coordinator may want  additional  information.  If  so,  he
     will contact  you.  Please  allow  at  least  two to three weeks
     for a node number request to be processed.


     2.2     If you are going down

     If  your  node will be down for an extended period (more than a
     day or two), then you should inform your coordinator as soon as
     possible.  If you do not do this,  then other systems will still
     try  to  reach  you while  you are down,  much to the annoyance
     of everyone.  Do not under any  circumstances  put an answering
     machine or similar device on your phone line while you are down.
     If you do,  then calling systems  will get  the  machine
     repeatedly,  racking up large phone bills,  which is very
     annoying.  See the section on Resolution of Disputes for  details
     on what happens to annoying people.

     If  you  will be leaving your system unattended for an extended
     period of time (such as while you are on vacation),  you should
     notify  your coordinator.  Systems  do have a tendency to "crash"
     now and then,  so you will probably want your coordinator to know
     that it is a temporary condition if it happens while you are
     away.

     2.3     How to form a network

     If there are several nodes in your area,  but no network, then
     you may wish to form your own.  You may also be requested to form
     a network by your Regional Coordinator.

     Your first step is to contact the other sysops in your area.  You
     must decide which nodes will comprise the network, and which of
     those nodes is  going  to be the Network Coordinator.  Your next
     step is to inform your Regional Coordinator.  You must send him a
     FidoNet  message  with the following information:


     1) The  region  number(s),  or  network  number(s)  if  a
     network  is splitting  up,  that are affected by the formation of
     FidoNews 5-24                Page 28                  13 Jun 1988


     your network.  The Regional  Coordinator  will  inform  the
     coordinators  of  any affected networks that a new network is in
     formation.

     2) The  name that you wish to call your network.  Please try to
     select a  name  that relates to your grouping.  For example,
     SoCalNet for nodes  in  the   Southern   California   Area   and
     MassNet for Massachusetts  Area.  Remember  if  you  call
     yourself  DOGNET it doesn't help others know what area of the
     country  (or  even  what    country) your group is in.

     3) A  copy  of  the  proposed  network's  nodelist.  The nodelist
     file    should be named Frrr-nnn.NET  where  rrr  is  the
     proposed  host's current  region  or  network  number  and  nnn
     is his current node number.  For example,  if the proposed host
     is currently listed  as  node  5  in  region 13,  then you would
     name the file F013-005.NET.  This file should be sent attached to
     the message of Application for a Network Number.


     Granting  of  a  network  number  is  not  automatic.   Your
     Regional Coordinator  will  review  your  application  and
     inform  you  of his decision.

     Do not send a network number request to the Zone Coordinator. All
     network  number  requests  must  be  processed  by  the  Regional
     Coordinator.

                                    Chapter 3

                             COORDINATOR PROCEDURES



     This  chapter describes the procedures followed by all
     coordinators at all levels.  Later we will go into more  detail
     on  those  procedures which are specific to any given type of
     coordinator.


     All  coordinators  have  four  primary duties.  In order of
     decreasing importance, they are:

         1) Administrative tasks.

         2) Node list distribution.

         3) Newsletter distribution.

         4) Network mail distribution.

     At first glance it would seem that network mail distribution
     should be the highest priority,  since after all  that's  why
     we're  running  a network in the first place.  But the first
     three priorities are needed to  ensure  smooth  operation  of
     the network,  and hence must have a higher priority.
     FidoNews 5-24                Page 29                  13 Jun 1988


     3.1     Administrative tasks

     First  and  foremost,  every  coordinator is also the sysop of
     his own node.  It must be possible for others to reach you  by
     network  mail. So  in  addition  to  the other tasks of a
     coordinator,  you must also observe all of the requirements for
     being a node.



     3.1.1   Maintaining the node list

     A coordinator at any level must maintain his portion of the node
     list. Almost any coordinator will have some nodes in his node
     list which are not a part of any subgroup.  For  example,  a
     Zone  Coordinator  must maintain  a list of administrative nodes
     for his zone,  and a Regional Coordinator must maintain a list of
     independent nodes in  his  region. A  Hub  Coordinator  (or  the
     Network Coordinator in a network without hubs) must maintain the
     list of all nodes in his area.

     A  coordinator is responsible for seeing to it that his portion
     of the node  list  is  kept  reasonably  accurate.   You  should
     attempt  to implement  name  changes,  phone number changes,  and
     so forth in this node list as soon as possible.  You should also
     check  from  time  to time  to  ensure  that  all of the listed
     nodes are in fact capable of accepting network mail.  How best to
     accomplish this is left  to  your discretion.

     3.1.2   Assigning node numbers

     You may assign node numbers to new nodes in your list, but keep
     in mind the following:

     1) It is your responsibility to ensure that the node number you
     assign is unique within that region or network.

     2) You should try to avoid assigning node  numbers  when  an
     existing subdivision  of  your  area  already covers the location
     of the new node.  For example,  a Regional Coordinator  should
     try  to  avoid  assigning independent nodes in a city that has
     its own network.

     You may also change the numbers of existing nodes in your area,
     though you should check with the respective nodes before doing
     so.

     You should not under any circumstances assign a  node  number  to
     any system  until  you  have received a formal request from that
     system by FidoNet mail.  This will ensure that the system is at
     least  minimally operational.  The  strict  maintenance  of this
     policy has been one of the great strengths of FidoNet.

     It  is  also recommended,  though not required,  that you call a
     board which is applying for a node number before assigning it a
     node number.
     FidoNews 5-24                Page 30                  13 Jun 1988


     You should use network mail to inform a new node of his  node
     number, as this helps to insure that he is capable of receiving
     network mail.



     3.1.3   Problem resolution

     From time to time you may be called on to resolve a  problem  in
     your area.  This  could be a technical problem relating to the
     four primary duties of a coordinator,  or it could be related to
     annoying behaviour on the part of someone in your area.

     If the problem is caused by a node or a coordinator immediately
     under you, then it is your responsibility to resolve the problem
     in whatever manner you deem fit.  If the problem is in a
     subdivision of your area, then  you  should  first  refer it to
     the appropriate coordinator.  If that coordinator does not
     resolve the problem satisfactorily, then you can appoint a
     replacement.

     3.1.4   Formulating local policy

     It  is  your  responsibility to formulate any local policies
     which are required for the smooth operation of your assigned
     area.  Any policies you establish must not conflict with any
     policies  established  by  a coordinator above you or with this
     policy document.



     3.2     Node list distribution

     The node list is posted weekly on Saturday,  along with a
     "difference file"  giving  the changes for the week.  It is your
     responsibility to obtain the difference file from your
     coordinator  every  week  and  to distribute   it   to  the
     coordinators  below  you.   The  method  of distribution is left
     to your discretion.  It is  also  desirable  that you make it
     available for downloading by the general user, but this is not
     required.



     3.3     Newsletter distribution

     The newsletter, called FidoNews,  is published weekly on Monday
     and is distributed as an archive named FNEWSvnn.ARC,  where "v"
     is the volume number and "nn" is the issue number.  It  is  your
     responsibility  to obtain this archive from your coordinator
     every week and to distribute it  to the coordinators below you.
     The method of distribution is left to your discretion.  It is
     also desirable that you make  it  available for  downloading  by
     the  general user in both archived an unarchived form, but this
     is not required.

     FidoNews 5-24                Page 31                  13 Jun 1988


     3.4     Network mail distribution

     It is your responsibility to ensure that network mail in your
     area  is operating  in  an  acceptable manner.  Exactly what this
     involves will depend on what level you are at,  and will be
     discussed in more detail below.



     3.5     Anything else

     You should encourage sysops and users in your region to
     contribute  to FidoNews.  If you receive any submissions,  you
     should forward them to the FidoNews publisher.  Think of yourself
     as being a regional  bureau chief on the FidoNews editorial
     staff.

     FidoNews  and  the  node  list  are  the  glue that holds us
     together. Without them,  we cease to be a community,  and  become
     just  another random collection of bulletin boards.

     3.6     Specific coordinator procedures

     The   above   outlines  the  procedures  which  are  followed  by
     all coordinators.  We will now discuss additional procedures
     followed  by specific types of coordinators.



     3.6.1   International Coordinator procedures

     The  International  Coordinator is elected by all regional
     coordinators in all zones. In case of a vacancy, the senior zone
     coordinator will  assume the position until such time as a new
     coordinator can be elected.

     The  International  Coordinator is responsible for format of the
     node-list and the update files.

     The  International  Coordinator  is  responsible for allocating
     zones, assigning zone numbers,  and for appointing the Zone
     Coordinator  for each zone.

     3.6.2   Zone Coordinator procedures

     A  Zone Coordinator is responsible for dividing his zone into
     regions, assigning region numbers,  and for appointing the
     Regional Coordinator for each region.  A Zone Coordinator also
     assigns a pool of numbers to each Regional Coordinator for use in
     assigning network numbers.

     A Zone Coordinator is responsible for locating nodes willing to
     act as zone gates for passing mail between his zone and the other
     zones,  if at  all possible.  A Zone Coordinator should not
     appoint any node as a zone gate unless the sysop of that node is
     willing and able to provide reasonably reliable interzone mail.
     FidoNews 5-24                Page 32                  13 Jun 1988


     Zone gates are highly  desirable, but if provided they must be
     reasonably reliable.

     A  Zone  Coordinator maintains the list of administrative nodes
     within his zone.  The administrative nodes will always have a
     region  number the  same  as the zone number.  For example,  the
     administrative nodes for Zone 3 will always be in Region 3.

     A Zone Coordinator may use administrative node addresses for
     whatever he  likes,  except  that  any node number which is the
     same as another zone number is reserved for the zone gate to that
     zone.  For  example, in  Zone  3  the network address "3/2" is
     reserved for use by the zone gate that passes mail from Zone 3 to
     Zone 2.

     A Zone Coordinator may not assign a region number that is the
     same  as any other zone number.  This is because administrative
     regions are, by definition, present in all zones.


     A zone coordinator is responsible for the weekly zone and world
     nodelist to be published in his zone on Saturdays.

     3.6.3   Regional Coordinator procedures

     A  Regional  Coordinator  is  responsible  for approving new
     networks, assigning network numbers,  and for appointing a
     Network  Coordinator for each network.

     Each  Regional  Coordinator  will be assigned a pool of numbers
     to use when assigning network numbers.  A Regional Coordinator
     should  never assign a network number outside of this pool,  and
     should never assign the same number to more than one network.  If
     a  Regional  Coordinator assigns  all  of the numbers in his
     pool,  he should apply to his Zone Coordinator for additional
     numbers.

     A  Regional Coordinator should try to avoid the needless
     proliferation of networks.  Networks should not be allocated on
     any basis other than technical  and  practical  considerations
     relating  to  network  mail operations.  For example, persons
     wishing to establish networks on the basis of special interests
     or for company mail should be encouraged to investigate  the
     alternatives,  such as echomail conferences and point networks.

     A  Regional  Coordinator  is  responsible  for maintaining the
     list of independent nodes within his region.  This will consist
     primarily  of those  nodes  which  are  not within the coverage
     area of any network. There are, however,  certain cases where a
     node should not be a member of  a  network,  such  as  a
     commercial system with a large volume of traffic which would clog
     the network.  The resolution of such  special cases is left to
     your own discretion.

     If  several  independent nodes in a region are in a "clump",
     then the Regional Coordinator should  encourage  or  require
     FidoNews 5-24                Page 33                  13 Jun 1988


     them  to  form  a network.  Refer  to  the  sysop  procedure  on
     forming  a network for more details.

     Note that this does  not  mean  that  a  Regional  Coordinator
     should encourage the formation of trivial networks.  Obviously,
     one node does not  make  a  network.  The  exact  number  of
     nodes  required for an effective network must be judged according
     to the circumstances of the situation, and is left to the
     discretion of the Regional Coordinator.

     It is the responsibility of a Regional Coordinator to ensure that
     the networks  within  his  region  are  operating in an
     acceptable manner. This does not mean that he is required to
     operate those networks; that is the responsibility of the Network
     Coordinators.  It means  that  he is  responsible  for seeing to
     it that the Network Coordinators within his region are acting
     responsibly.

     A Regional Coordinator is obligated to maintain direct and
     reasonably frequent contact with the networks in his region.  The
     exact method of accomplishing   this  is  left  to  the
     discretion  of  the  Regional Coordinator.

     3.6.4   Network Coordinator procedures

     A Network Coordinator is responsible for assigning node numbers
     to any nodes  within  his network which are not managed by a Hub
     Coordinator. A Network Coordinator is also  responsible  for
     allocating  any  hubs within  his network and for appointing a
     Hub Coordinator for each hub. If a Network Coordinator assigns
     any Hub Coordinators,  then  he  also assigns a pool of numbers
     to each Hub Coordinator for use in assigning node numbers.

     It  is  the  responsibility  of  a  Network Coordinator to
     receive all inbound mail for nodes in  his  network  and  to
     forward  it  to  its recipients.  How  to  accomplish this is
     left to the discretion of the Network Coordinator.  However,
     there are a few exceptions:

     1) Once in awhile a node will try to make a "bombing run"
     (sending one message to a great many nodes).  Bombing runs are
     considered to  be annoying, and may be dealt with accordingly.

     2) Occasionally  a  user  will  appear  who  receives  a great
     deal of traffic.  If a single node is receiving enough  mail  to
     interfere  with  mail  delivery  to  the other nodes in his
     network,  then his Network Coordinator can refer him to his
     Regional  Coordinator  for reassignment as an independent node.

     3) The most common source of routing overload  is  echomail.
     Echomail is  a nice invention,  and offers great benefits,  but
     it cannot be allowed to degrade the ability of FidoNet to handle
     normal  message traffic.  If  a  node  in  a  network  is
     routing large volumes of echomail,  the sysop can be asked to
     either  limit  the  amount  of echomail,  or  even  to  stop
     routing his echomail completely.  The design of echomail is such
     FidoNews 5-24                Page 34                  13 Jun 1988


     that it is a simple matter to do  either  of these.

     A Network Coordinator is responsible for assigning any additional
     mail events  which  may be required for operation of his network.
     Any node in a network may  be  excommunicated  for  failing  to
     observe  these additional mail events.

     A  Network  Coordinator may appoint a node as the outbound
     gateway for his network if he so desires and if one  can  be
     found.  In  no  case should  a node be appointed as an outbound
     gateway unless the sysop of that node is willing and able to
     provide reasonably reliable  service. Note that a Network
     Coordinator is not required to appoint an outbound gateway.  If
     a  Network  Coordinator  chooses  to appoint an outbound gateway,
     then it is left to the Network Coordinator to establish  any
     rules, policies, and procedures relating to its use.

     3.6.5   Hub Coordinator procedures

     A  Hub  Coordinator is responsible for assigning node numbers to
     nodes in his area.  Each Hub Coordinator will be assigned a pool
     of  numbers to  use  when  assigning node numbers.  A Hub
     Coordinator should never assign a node number outside of this
     pool, and should never assign the same number to more than one
     node.  If a Hub Coordinator  assigns  all of the numbers in his
     pool, he should apply to his Network Coordinator for additional
     numbers.

     It  is  the responsibility of a Hub Coordinator to receive all
     inbound mail for nodes in his hub and to forward it to its
     recipients.  How to accomplish this is left to the  discretion
     of  the  Hub  Coordinator. However, the same exceptions apply
     here as for a Network Coordinator.

     A  Hub  Coordinator  may  have  additional duties,  as assigned
     by his Network Coordinator.

     The  world  not  being  perfect,  sometimes  troubles  crop  up.
     Any organization larger than a cub scout pack needs some sort of
     grievance procedure, and FidoNet is no exception.

     The FidoNet judicial philosophy can be summed up in two rules:

         1) Thou shalt not excessively annoy others.

         2) Thou shalt not be too easily annoyed.

     In  other  words,  there  are  no hard and fast rules of conduct,
     but reasonably polite behavior is expected.  Also,  in  any
     dispute  both sides  are examined,  and action could be taken
     FidoNews 5-24                Page 35                  13 Jun 1988


     against either or both parties. ("Judge not, lest ye be judged!")

     In  any  case  of  annoying  behavior the person to complain to
     is the coordinator of the person who is annoying you.  For
     example,  if  you have a problem with a point or a user you would
     complain to his sysop, or  if  you  have  a  problem  with  a
     Regional Coordinator you would complain to his Zone Coordinator,
     and so on.

     If the coordinator you complain to fails to resolve the problem,
     then you  can  complain  to  his  coordinator.  For  example,  if
     you had a problem with a Hub  Coordinator,  you  would  first
     complain  to  his Network Coordinator.  Then if the Network
     Coordinator does not resolve the problem, you would complain to
     his Regional Coordinator.

     Do  not ever skip over a coordinator when filing a complaint.
     That in itself is annoying.

                           What Price Echo Mail

     This  article  is going to deal with a subject which  is  getting
     very close to my pocket book and many others as well.   In recent
     months it seems echomail has not only become popular with SySop's
     but users as well.  An the question has arisen who should pay for
     echomail.   This question like most others is fair,  and deserves
     an answer.  Even if it may not be what most folks want to hear.

     In  recent  weeks the feed for most of this region (15) has  been
     down.   I find out by reading echomail,  the feed is running  six
     (6),  9600  baud  HST  modems (wish I just had one).   An  he  is
     getting  flamed  left and right in almost every echomail  area  I
     read.   Then  I  am  politely reminded by a  little  bird  on  my
     shoulder.   I  do not know this guy from Adam,  he is providing a
     service  to me and many of the other nodes in the western  United
     States, and his so called fellow sysops are Flaming him.

     So I ask the QUESTION.

     "WHAT IS THE PRICE OF ECHOMAIL?"

     Like  most  everyone else except for a few I started  picking  up
     echomail when it really got started.   Presently I use two feeds,
     one  here in Region 15,  and one from Region 19.   Both are  long
     distance calls and presently average 10-15 minutes each.  It just
     so  happens  both  feeds have been affected by the  loss  of  the
     western feed.   So for a couple of weeks now,  messages have been
     sporadic to say the least.

     I  now  carry 23 echo areas,  some of which are used  solely  for
     myself, and most which are forwarded to other nodes locally.  But
     I  read  every  single  message  that  comes  into  this   board.
     Basically  since  I  have  very few users,  because  I  have  not
     advertised the BBS very much.  The BBS is largely a message base,
     in  fact  recently when my internal clock was reset to  the  year
     1990 by a game my son plays.   I lost or rather had killed over 7
     megs of messages because they were over 15 days old.   Yes, I had
     read all of them but it makes you wonder.  If I am a small system
     and have over 7 megs of messages what do some of the other larger
     systems have.

     Recently  purchasing a 2400 Baud Ven-Tel modem I hope to  cut  my
     cost, I do not expect it to be cut in half or anything like that,
     even a 50 dollar cut off of 137.00 will help.   An if I figure it
     right,  a  50  dollar cut would pay for my new modem in  about  8
     months.

     FidoNews 5-24                Page 37                  13 Jun 1988


     I  now turn the topic of this article to the real subject.   Just
     who should pay for echomail?   I say this cost MUST be shared  by
     all  of  us.   If it cost my feeds $80.00 each a month to  pickup
     their echo mail,  and they use a 9600 baud modem.  You can figure
     the cost of your echo mail using the following formula.

         9600                 100%       75%        50%       25%

         9600/9600 = 1          80.00      60.00      40.00     20.00
         9600/2400 = 4         320.00     240.00     120.00     80.00
         9600/1200 = 8         640.00     480.00     320.00    120.00
         9600/300  = 32       2560.00    1920.00    1280.00    512.00

         2400                 100%       75%        50%        25%

         2400/2400 = 1         320.00     240.00     120.00     80.00
         2400/1200 = 2         640.00     480.00     320.00    120.00
         2400/300  = 8        2560.00    1920.00    1280.00    512.00

         1200                 100%       75%        50%        25%

         1200/1200 = 1         640.00     480.00     320.00    120.00
         1200/300  = 4        2560.00    1920.00    1280.00    512.00

     I  am most certainly willing to support my feed in any way I  can
     but if I were to pickup all the echomail he received in a  months
     time  frame,  I would have already paid 4 times what he paid just
     to  get mail from him.   But since I do my planning a little  bit
     ahead  I am only picking up those areas I want to  read.   So  my
     cost is is not going to be the full cost of echomail to him.

     An  it would not matter to Ma Bell who gives them the money.   If
     my  feed decided he was no longer going to allow me to  poll  him
     for mail.   If he was going to make all the calls and then charge
     me  a rate comparable to his phone cost.   He would in  fact,  be
     doing  me a favor,  except it would still cost me XX dollars  per
     month.  It is now up to me to decide what I am willing to pay for
     my end of echomail.

     So what I am going to PRESUME IS:

          1.  It will cost me to call my feed.
          2.  Or it will cost me to have him call.

     Either way, I will be paying out of my pocket.

     I now ask,  which is easier?   Of course, I call him.  I do it at
     my  own time,  when he allows me to do so,  normally between 0200
     and  0500  in  the morning.   The  cheapest  time  to  call.   So
     basically it means:   ECHOMAIL is going to cost me exactly what I
     am willing to pay for it.

     As  the local and Net 301 feed,  I am making several proposals to
     those  who I distribute mail to on how WE can solve this  problem
     which  will soon face us.   They are the only ways I know  of  US
     maintaining our connection.
     FidoNews 5-24                Page 38                  13 Jun 1988


     So it all comes down to these few simple FACTS.

     What  Price of EchoMail is what you and I are going to be willing
     to  pay for it.   I personally want it as cheap as I can get  it.
     My  wife  wants it cheaper.   Even if as she  put  it,  it  means
     cutting  back in the number of areas I receive,  or telling those
     nodes  who I make distribution to locally presently at  no  cost,
     except to one who has already agreed to pay his fair share,  they
     will  have to find other means of obtaining the echos they  want.
     But  then  if I was a distribution point I would not want 3 or  4
     nodes from the same area making pickup.  So one way or the other,
     MY price for EchoMail will be my monthly PHONE Bill.

                     IFNA Status Report for June 1988


     PROGRESS DURING THIS PERIOD

     General

     First of all, I'd like to report that FIDOCON '88 preparation is
     still charging ahead.  There is a great deal of preparation and
     additional effort being expended to make this the biggest and
     best FIDOCON ever.

     From what I hear, there is an exciting key-note speaker lined-up:
     one of the innovators and "mavericks" of the industry.  I'll let
     the Conference Organizing Committee give you the details when
     they're positive that everything is finalized, but it looks like
     this will be another highlight.  The Committee seems to be going
     all out to provide a wide-range of topics, from the very
     technical to the important political issues that need to be
     resolved.  If you hurry, I think you may still have a chance at
     the drawing for the U.S. Robotics 9600 HST modem, so get your
     registration in now!

     Meanwhile, quite a few other activities are underway that sound
     very exciting.  Should they continue in the direction they appear
     headed, it looks like we will have a lot of work to do, but will
     stand a very good chance of bringing real distinction to FidoNet
     through IFNA.

     The first of these, headed up by David Drexler, involves support
     for the younger set.  There already is a KID'S NET which was
     started by the Witherspoon family, I believe.  They've given us
     some ideas and help and Dave has been able to make several
     contacts in related areas.  In one such undertaking, several
     hundred schools in the U.S. and Australia are already linked
     through a commercial network supported as a pilot project by one
     of the major carriers.  It looks like that support may not
     continue into the fall and there may well be a chance for us to
     step in and provide some real cost-effective assistance to the
     schools that wish to continue.

     In another project led by IFNA Vice-President Mark Grennan, a
     specially modified mailer is being developed that can be used by
     the blind.  Several institutions that support the blind are very
     interested in the potential of this approach and have indicated
     various levels of support.  There are still a few problems to be
     worked out, but hope is high that we can make quite a
     FidoNews 5-24                Page 45                  13 Jun 1988


     contribution to this segment of our population.

     Still another project deals with support for the deaf.  Due to
     manning problems, we've had difficulty in getting this one
     underway.  We could use help on all these areas, but particulary
     this one which has initial contacts in the D.C. area.

     These and other activities going on behind the scenes hold a
     great deal of promise for FidoNet to make even a far greater
     influence than it already has.  But with this potential comes
     considerable responsibility and it it very necessary for us all
     to settle some of the political and technical issues that
     separate us, thereby making it possible for those that wish to
     and can support such beneficial endeavors to do so.

     Please, if you believe in such activities, make a real attempt to
     come to FIDOCON.  We need your support and energy to clear some
     of the obstacles between us and some really worthwhile
     contributions to the public.


      ADMINISTRATION AND FINANCE

     Unfortunately, Greg Small, who filled the empty Chair of this
     committee, has been beset by some overpowering personal
     considerations and has had to drop out.  This leaves us again,
     without a leader for this important area.  Certain aspects are
     proceeding along regardless, such as the financial work by
     Leonard Mednick and various projects by Steve Bonine.  But we do
     need someone who can organize a great many administrative
     services and requirements to make us all more efficient.


     BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     The BoD has resolved the technical difficulties encountered with
     its recent management changeovers.  Voting reports appear weekly
     in IFNA, so I'll not repeat them here.


     BY-LAWS AND RULES

     No formal report was received from Steve Jordan.  However, we
     have been involved in several discussions regarding some
     much-needed amendments to the By-laws.  Steve's committee is
     finalizing the rules for this summer's vote on the suggested
     amendments.


     EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

     As most of the members of the Executive Committee are forced to
     do double duty on other matters, the efforts involved in
     replacing Tom Marshall who resigned as Secretary due to personal
     and professional concerns, have taken up most of the available
     time.
     FidoNews 5-24                Page 46                  13 Jun 1988


     My personal thanks to Tom who has contributed a great deal of
     service to FidoNet.


     INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS

     No official report was received from Henk Wevers, but he has told
     me that they are expecting 120 or more for EuroCon II.  Those of
     us that will be attending are looking forward to this event - in
     my case, I expect it to provide additional input towards our
     preparation for FIDOCON.


     MEMBERSHIP SERVICES

     Phil Ardussi informs me that the tapes from last FIDOCON are
     finally ready and will be available at this year's conference.
     Plans are already underway for next year's conference.  They are
     putting the finishing touches on the forms and processes for
     evaluating bids for FIDOCON '89.  It is expected that bids will
     be requested and received in time to make the decision and
     announcement at this year's conference.


     NOMINATIONS AND ELECTIONS

     The chairmanship of this committee was just changed from David
     Garrett to Rob Barker on the request of the BoD.  Although the
     By-laws don't specifically say so, it appears that their intent
     was to maintain separation between the IFNA Secretary and the
     functions of this committee.  Therefore, as David Garrett has
     just been elected the new Secretary of IFNA, he was asked to
     relinquish the chair.  Our thanks to David for his recent efforts
     in handling the nominations and working toward the establishment
     of the rules for the upcoming election.


     PUBLICATIONS

     No report was received on this matter from Tim Sullivan (who
     is presently concentrating his efforts on FIDOCON!).


     TECHNICAL STANDARDS

     No report was received from Randy Bush.


     ETHICS COMMITTEE

     No specific report was received from Bill Allbritten, but I did
     get a copy of a draft of a Standard of Ethics for the leadership
     of IFNA.  I was very impressed with this document, as it appears,
     in addition to spelling out various standards of performance and
     conduct, to really provide the membership with an independent
     mechanism for monitoring the officers and directors of IFNA.
     FidoNews 5-24                Page 47                  13 Jun 1988


     There are still some details to be cleaned up, but I'm confident
     everyone will be impressed at the reasonable scope of this
     document.


     VP-TC

     Dave Dodell did not provide a report.


     FIDOCON LIAISON

     Tim Sullivan's report was summarized above.



     PROBLEMS

     As can be seen from the above, the extra burdens and lures of the
     encroaching summertime have cut into the remaining time available
     for FidoNet.  This demonstrates that there are plenty of
     opportunities for others to get involved and take on some of the
     load.  In fact, I would really like to call for a maximum limit
     on the number of "hats" an individual can wear, due to the
     difficulty so many have trying to meet the many other requirments
     of life and sysoping.



     PROGNOSIS FOR NEXT PERIOD

     We are really looking forward to some of the various projects
     currently underway coming to fruition.

     And of course, FIDOCON should be a marvelous opportunity for us
     to get together and continue the new understanding and desire to
     work towards solutions that seems to have started to take hold
     throughout the Net.
